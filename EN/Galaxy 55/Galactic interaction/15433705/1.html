                <p>So, I'm trying to compile data on crashed ships in order to figure out a pattern of some sort. I've seen shots of 2 ships on these forums. Both on Red Earth planets, and both in wide open spaces. (one in water and the other on land) I've heard the ones found on the french forums were on a jungle and a desert, but due to my lack of familiarity with French, and the high activity of their boards (most of it doesn't even seem G55 related) getting information is proving difficult.</p><p>What I want to know is things like spawn height, location (open space or possibly under foliage or ground), things like that so that those of us looking for ships can narrow our efforts a bit.</p><p>My questions are, I suppose:<br>Are they all spawning in similar places? If that's the case then finding one shouldn't be too tough, and it just happens VERY rarely. <br>Are the spawn locations dissimilar? It THIS is the case, they may not even be as rare as we think, they may just be spawning in caves or under water, and we're simply not finding them.</p><p>It may be a pointless effort, and ultimately fruitless, especially with such a small pool of data, but I figured I'd give it a shot. I suppose just declaring them "rare" isn't enough for me.</p><p>If anyone can help with info, it'd be appreciated.</p>

                <p>Well yes, but how do we KNOW that? Because it's what a lot of people think?</p><p>While I know it's not restricted to a certain type of planet, "It can spawn anywhere" still isn't much of an answer. What I'm interested in is actually seeing pics of these other ships so as to determine if that's actually the case.</p><p>The two I've seen here both appeared to be at or near sea level and out in the open. While that could be a coincidence, it would be wrong to assume that it is or it isn't. The planet generation may specifically look for flat areas exposed to the sky to put them, or it might not and they could just as easily spawn sticking out of the side of a mountain, or at the bottom of a lake, or hell even embedded in rock 30 meters down.</p><p>If someone else has already figured this all out, then by all means, point me to the thread. I'd just as soon save myself the time.</p>

You do raise an interesting point however that the seeds for generation have to be drawn from somewhere.

First it generates the land itself (dirt and rocks) and then it goes back and decides what goes where, probably something like caves &gt; lakes &gt; mineral deposits &gt; forests and so on. (notice how lakes never spill into caves, and red earth trees never appear on mountains) The game seems to look for relatively flat areas to place stands of trees, so it could do the same with ships, houses, or anything else. Or it could specifically look for areas that are NOT flat.

If that's the case then searching caves and lake bottoms is pointless.

What I'd like to do is determine the order of these things and where ships and other structures fit into it all. I think this would make is easier to find specific things that we're looking for.

I'd expect there will be plenty more items that can only be obtained by exploration, and future updates will only make planets more interesting. It'd be good for players to know where to look when they wanted something. We may look back someday and laugh at the days we were hunting for engines, but be pulling out hair out to find some other upgrade.</p><p>What's really becoming interesting is people's opposition to the idea.

Second it doesn't need spawn conditions. It can just as well be (very simple example) some code that, while generating terrain, iterates say 1000 times and if 999 times return true, it will spawn a ship.</cite><p>Of course it wont be truly random. But there is huge gap between "predictable" and "random". For example, consider following sequence of numbers - what will be the following one? 176, 38, 109, 72, 29, 154, 132, 195, 124, 49, 22 ... it's really simple and completely deterministic.</p>

I actually had an ice planet smack in the middle of one of those debris fields. It seemed to have a higher than average number of green crystals (whatever the money things are called) but that was it. Perhaps they up the chances? Like the ships are escape pods from whatever left the debris.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_2233912 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="2233912">tikker</span></span><cite><p>In all games like this, even Minecraft, you need some sort of procedural generation process to start with. If terrain would generate 'truly' random, you'd see bedrock floating in the air, with islands of diamond and lava (for Minecraft) or the planet core would be wood (for Galaxy55) for example.</p><p>So my bet is on that ships do not have very specific spawn conditions or even no conditions at all (maybe besides having enough space).</p></cite><p>That's...pretty much exactly what I said a page ago. XD As for the spawn conditions, what makes you think that? The two images we have would seem to say differently. If anyone can speak french, or knows where to find any shots of the ships found over there, PLEASE clue me in. Even if they disprove my suspicions, they'd be extremely helpful. Even being proven wrong would be proof of something.</p>
