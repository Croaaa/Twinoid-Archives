                <p>And by "They", I mean the deadly rocks which inhabit all planets! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong><em><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5992" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5992</a></em></strong></p><p>Hello everyone, I was Jin Su for this ship and it was fairly interesting for my first casting ship. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/kim_jin_su.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_KJS:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>For those who weren't on board this ship, or didn't get to see it to the end, I will give a quick run down of what occurred.</p><p><strong>Day 1-3</strong><br>-After the horror stories of the first casting ship, we did everything we could to ensure critical items were protected. <br>-An Alpha mush died on the first day, which crippled the mushes efforts. We discovered that Stephen was our mush, after Chao <em>obtained</em> all the information he needed from him.<br>-After Stephen's death, anti mush research was cranked out with incredible speeds. I think we had the Pheromodem by day 2 or 3.</p><p><strong>Day 4-8</strong><br>-On day 4 or so our second Alpha Mush was killed, this time it was Raluca.<br>-On day 6, Terrence was cured of his dirty ways. He then started to build up a drone army, as he got to select robotics expert for a second time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>-Around day 8 or so, Roland died from starvation. This was our first human casualty <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Day 9-13</strong><br>At this point we started going on daily expos, generally when I was about to go to sleep... Here are a few of the notable expos we went on:<br>-Got around 12+ alien steaks from one expo, which Frieda ate most of.<br>-A starmap fragment, wahey!<br>-Kuan Ti wandered away from the group because Janice was being mean. He then created a snowman, who became his best friend. <br>-We then later lost Ian on an expo. We sadly found him in a pool of his own blood. Turns out he stubbed his toe on a rock and bled out...</p><p><strong>Day 14-16</strong><br>Around this time we got our 2nd starmap fragment, Eden was almost within our grasp!<br>Sadly though that starmap fragment was cursed, or at least I think it was.<br>It first started with <em>8 fires</em> occurring in one cycle, just as we were about to go on an expo to a planet with a crystalite zone.<br>The planet it self wasn't that dangerous, expect for the seismic activity.</p><p>Unfortunately Kuan Ti tripped on a rock and fell into the endless abyss, of this planet.<br>Then after that we ended up losing Finola in the Cristalite sector. We did find her later on, though not in the way we had expected though...<br>We found her under a piece of sheet metal, that we can only assume fell from the deadalus.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">Finola is dead. Cause: Lost explorer 3min<br>You have lost 4 hp. 3min<br>An unexpected lurch caused a sheet of metal to land on Finola. She is seriously injured!</span></p><p><strong>Day 17-18</strong><br>The worst was yet to come...</p><p>After Frieda diet of rations, she quickly became the size of me! I thought it was a good look, but apparently the ol daeda-shed thought differently. Essentially every cycle, or two, she was hit by a steel plate, a room shake or more, while a few others were fine.<br>As well as this our O2 tanks were breaking every cycle. Without Kuan Ti, it became quite hard to keep on top of repairs.</p><p>It all became far to much for us to handle, so we were forced to return to Sol. Unfortunately we lost Hua the cycle we decided we needed to call the adventure to a close.</p>

                <p>Thank you, Commander Kim, for the good summary of events. I've been meaning to chime in on this one for a while. First time <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/paola.png" alt=":mush_paola_50:" class="tid_ico"> here. This was overall a fun ship with Jin Su, Kuan Ti, and Janice in particular keeping things lively post-mush.</p><p>Unfortunately there seemed to be a significant dip in interest that hampered our Eden run. That and the really bad luck of losing 3 pots in a fire around Day 6 or so. A few extremely quiet, sometimes inactive folks also made this a less chatty voyage than I was hoping.</p><p>We really should have been more patient after getting the 2nd starmap. We had a tough time finding Cristalite, and because of that rushed into a bad situation at a Seismic planet, where we lost not one but two vital crewmates. The Daedalus raining sheet metal on Finola while she was wandering around on the surface was just ridiculous. After that we were pretty much done.</p><p>We humans made a huge mistake early. Terry and Raluca pushed PILGRED near 40% with no objection from the rest of the crew. We allowed it because Raluca was silver but without Tech, and Terry was the only other Tech on board at that point. This was good lesson that if there are multiple active players with PILGRED bonuses, and multiple mush on board, PILGRED should probably stay at 0. Terry explained the details on board, but they were just a couple of cycles away from a rush/transfer/return when they were discovered. If they had kept it around 20% and waited for Raluca to level up to Physicist+Tech, we might not have gotten so antsy (I PM'd Chao shortly before he acted and it was clear a lot of us had been worried about this). Which brings me to my last point...</p><p>The mush hunt sounded like fun, although I was holed up on the bridge and mostly out of it. Chao was deadly when action was needed. However, the last two mush were uncovered using Natamy testing, and I'm curious about what everyone thinks of that. Without it, there's a decent chance the mush could have forced a return.</p><p>In general I'm also interested to see how our casting ends up balancing out for Human v. Mush and whether additional tweaks need to be made. Ship #1 sounded like a wild ride and very plausible mush victory. In Ships #2 and #3 the humans won easily (though again it may have been closer than it looked in Ship #2) with no beta mush created.</p>
