                <p>Hello everyone! The most recent update added two new characters, <strong>Andie</strong> and <strong>Derek</strong>. This guide here will be for <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Andie</strong>, and is a work in progress, so any input from other players is welcome.</p><p><em><strong>Recommended Activity Level</strong></em> - Mid to high. You'll either be the head of research, a <em>Pilot</em>, or both, so be ready to relay or to knock out hunters when possible.</p><p><em><strong>Special Trait</strong></em> - <em>Androgynous</em> - Can flirt or do the thing with anyone on the ship, and cannot get pregnant. Gives you the ability game-play wise to fill in for a lack of males or females, given the situation. RP wise it opens up all sorts of avenues for LGBT play. Why does <strong>Roland</strong> keep dropping the soap in <em>Bravo Dorm</em>? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em><strong>Skills</strong></em></p><ul><li><em>Pilot</em> - Allows you to take out a patrol craft, the Pasiphae, and the Icarus without causing damage to the Daedalus. Allows for 80% accuracy firing from the patrol craft as well. This also allows you to set a stance while in a patrol craft. A valuable skill for the ship, especially in the late game, and allows you to help out in the late game when research is finished. Provides a bonus to the NERON projects <strong>Anti-gravity Thrusters</strong>, <strong>Bay Door XXL</strong>, <strong>Blaster Gun</strong>, <strong>Large Bay Upgrade</strong>, <strong>Launch Propulsion System</strong>, <strong>Magnetic Net</strong>, and <strong>Trail Minimizer</strong>.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Devotion</em> - Gives you an additional 3 AP for every mission you receive. This means you will receive 6 AP for every mission, so make sure you let the commander know you need missions! This gives you a huge amount of AP to work with each day, and helps to minimize the impact of performing multiple roles.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Polyvalent</em> - The reason you chose Andie. This skill should always be taken, no matter what. It gives you the bonuses of <em>Botanist</em>, <em>Diplomat</em>, and most importantly, <em>Biologist</em>, without their associated special actions or points. From <em>Botanist</em> you get to read the effects of food consumption, gain one additional fruit for each <strong>Harvest</strong> event in an expedition, can view the properties of plants, and have a bonus to the NERON projects <strong>Extra Hydropots</strong>, <strong>Heat Lamps</strong>, and <strong>Hydroponic Incubator</strong>, but you do <strong>NOT</strong> get the <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_garden.png" alt=":mush_pa_garden:" class="tid_ico"> points. From <em>Diplomat</em>, you remove the possibility of a <strong>Fight</strong> event on expeditions, but you do not get the ability to call a <strong>Ceasefire</strong>. From <em>Biologist</em> you get everything; the ability to readth e properties of pills, the 4-6% research bonus, and the bonus to NERON projects <strong>Convenient Sink</strong> and <strong>Oxygenated Ducts</strong>. If you're Andie, then Finola will not be on the ship, meaning you should take this skill no matter what.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Confident</em> - Gives the option for other players to <strong>Chit Chat</strong> with you for 1 AP, revealing as many actions they performed as you have morale and giving the other player 2 Morale. This can be performed once per day. This reveals <strong><em>ANY</em></strong> action you have performed, including mush actions, so it can be used as a voluntary substitute to Chao's <em>Torturer</em> ability. This is also a backup morale booster if all other options are lost, and can give <strong>Janice</strong> a way to gain morale outside of speeches and doing the thing. A powerful skill that requires no effort on you part, but doesn't replace the usefulness of <em>Polyvalent</em>.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Expert</em> - This skill raises the successful completion chance of any chance based attempt by 20% (someone confirm if it's multiplicative or additive please?), but also increases your chances or injury or getting dirty by 20%. A good skill to combine with roles that have 0 risk of getting dirty or getting injured, but a risky skill to take, and requires 250 EXP to get.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Bronze</strong></em></p><ul><li><em>Pilot</em> - Should only be taken as a bronze player if you know there is an active human <strong>Ian</strong> and/or <strong>Paola</strong> on board with <em>Biologist</em>. Allows you to do what all <em>Pilots</em> do, kill hunters and protect the ship.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Devotion</em> - While it is a powerful skill, 99% of the time as Bronze you should <strong>NOT</strong> take this skill. If you chose to wait until <em>mush</em> selection however, and a <em>Biologist</em> or <em>Medic</em> book appears, and Janice has <em>Diplomat</em>, it might be worth taking, but in almost all cases <em>Polyvalent</em> is a better choice. If you've got two other <em>Biologists</em> on board that are active, and there's a <em>Pilot</em> book as well, it may be tempting to take this skill, but it's highly situational. Almost every time as a bronze player you should not take this skill.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Polyvalent</em> - 9/10 times this should be taken. For 55 EXP, it's the cheapest <em>Diplomat</em>, it serves to replace <strong>Finola</strong> who will always be absent, it allows you to view medicines, and it gives an extra fruit on expeditions. Possibly one of the more powerful skills in the game, and puts a lot of responsibility on <strong>Andie</strong>. You'll be head of the research team and a required member of expeditions if there's no other <em>Diplomat</em> on board.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Confident</em> - Good skill for morale gain, but not worth taking as bronze. If you're the only person to raise morale on the ship then there's going to be more issues than <em>Confident</em> will fix. <em>Polyvalent</em> and <em>Pilot</em> are usually better choices.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Expert</em> - High EXP cost for bronze (551 cycles of EXP gain), coupled with the fact that, like <em>Creative</em>, it is meant to be used in combination with other skills, means you'd be wasting your EXP as a bronze player to take this skill. Save that EXP for another character, like <em>Caffeine Junky</em> or <em>Apprentice</em>.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Silver</strong></em></p><ul><li><em>Polyvalent</em> + <em>Devotion</em> - Use missions to be the most powerful researcher on board. Usually the best choice, unless you are lacking in <em>Pilots</em>. Might not be worth taking if the commander is inactive however, as you won't get your missions in that case.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Polyvalent</em> + <em>Pilot</em> - Divides your AP between two AP intensive roles, but gives you flexibility to fill roles as needed. Mush not a threat? Then you can take out some hunters. A viable replacement for <em>Polyvalent</em> + <em>Devotion</em>, just make sure you get a bed.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Polyvalent</em> + <em>Confident</em> - Let's you power through research, but serve as a way to gain morale as well, all without splitting your AP between two roles. Most ships, however, don't last long enough for there to be widespread panic attacks, so a <em>Shrink</em> and a <em>Leader</em> Should be enough to take care of morale loss. Still, if a <em>Pilot</em> book is available, may be worth taking.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Pilot</em> + <em>Devoted</em> - Makes you the single most powerful <em>Pilot</em> in the game, rivaling <strong>Roland</strong> in flying prowess, at the expense of crippling expeditions and research if no <em>Diplomats</em> or <em>Biologists</em> are on board. Make sure if you go this route that you let your crew know before hand, as not taking <em>Polyvalent</em> might get you killed.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Pilot</em> + <em>Confident</em> - Making yourself an OK <em>Pilot</em> and giving you some ability to raise morale if <em>Biologists</em> are covered and there is no <em>Shrink</em>, but in most cases if <strong>Janice</strong> is inactive that means no <em>Diplomat</em>, so only take this if you <strong><em>KNOW</em></strong> there's a way to make up the research loss and a <em>Diplomat</em> book available.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Pilot</em> + <em>Expert</em> - Pretty good combo, but carries the same inherent risks of slowing research way down, not to mention the EXP cost of getting this far.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Gold</strong></em></p><ul><li><em>Pilot</em> + <em>Devoted</em> + <em>Polyvalent</em> + <em>Confident</em> - Let's you fill all the major roles, gives you the AP to do so, and let's you run the ship. A powerful combo, and typically is the best way to go.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Pilot</em> + <em>Polyvalent</em> + <em>Confident</em> + <em>Expert</em> - If <em>Expert</em> gives you an additional 20% success chance (again, someone please confirm if it's multiplicative or additive), then you're guaranteed to hit as <em>Pilot</em>, and still let's you fill in all the other roles, and gives the Commander more reason to spread out his missions as needed, but not as versatile as the previous combination and more costly EXP wise.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Tips for In-Game</strong></em></p><p>Assuming you've got <em>Polyvalent</em>, you're going to be at the head of the research department. If you've also got <em>Pilot</em>, then you'll need all the AP you can get. Typically you should claim the <em>med lab</em> bed, and have <strong>Chun</strong> watch over you. If you don't have <em>Confident</em>, then nobody else should be allowed in your room unless they are confirmed human, or have an injury. You should also update your crew mates on the properties of pills and fruits, as for now Astropad doesn't treat <em>Polyvalent</em> like it does <em>Biologist</em> and <em>Botanist</em>. Also make sure if you've got <em>Devoted</em> that the commander is well informed of the consequences of not giving you his mission every day without good reason.</p><p><em><strong>Mush Play</strong></em></p><p>No personal experience as a <em>Mush</em> <strong>Andie</strong>, so any advice is welcome. I do know that it is a bad day for the humans if both you and the commander are <em>Mush</em>, as those missions can be saved for a rampage that would make <strong>Derek</strong> weep in a corner. Only problem would be that your AP is the most valuable on the ship, so expect to have an excuse as to why you're not getting that bonus from the food you will probably receive to knock out ASG and Constipaspore by Day 2.</p><p><em><strong>Role Play</strong></em></p><p>Andie is a character that opens up a huge number of options. Want to be a lesbian? Go ahead. Straight male? Sure. You can be whatever you want with Andie. The fact that you can't get pregnant and can impregnate women doesn't definitively make you male. It's the 31st century, you could have developed a way for two women to have a child, you are a <em>Polyvalent</em> genius after all. Can't make yourself pregnant? Maybe you're infertile, how rude of people to claim you're male because you can't have kids! You are free to go wherever you want with Andie.</p>

                <p>Don't just go and <em>declare</em> Andie male. <br>Let people decide that for themselves. <br>And on every ship anew.</p><p>You can be whatever you prefer or see more fitting and that's just one of the advantages of playing Andie. I've been a female Andie and a male Andie and damn shit every time there was some rude idiot trying to decide my gender for me. <em>Don't do that. It's rude.</em> If you see an androgynous person at the mall, do you walk over and tell them what to be? No. So<em> let the Andies decide their gender and preferences for themselves.</em></p><p>Yes, Andie was designed as male. And it's very easy to notice that. But they removed the trait so <em>you can be female</em> aswell. Want to be a female lesbian? Be it. Your girl got pregnant although you wanted to play your Andie as woman? So what! Be an awesome polyvalent lesbian research genius that impregnated her girlfriend thanks to in-vitro-fertilization. Want to be a straight women but people point fingers at you for not getting pregnant? So what. Maybe the guys juice is to weak eh. Being unable to become pregnant is something women all over the world suffer from. Would you go tell them that they are male now?</p><p>I agree on the the commander part. Though that only really goes for Jin Su. Since the others act as commander without having the rank. And you need a decent Jin Su. Which is a rarity itself.</p>

                <p>If I might interject... (And the use of male pronouns to refer to somebody who's gender is not know is a rule of the English language, not any statement on the actual gender)</p><p>By looking at Andie's skill set and bio, I would say he's Book Smart but Street Dumb, with a bad case of hero worship. The former has rather easy to comprehend: he is the only triple laureate in the entire Federation (and thus, arguably, one of the most intelligent people in the Federation), but remember: he's spent her entire life under the direct guidance of the Federation in "youth program" and later under their tutelage at a military collage (As shown by Derek's profile, in which the school he teachs at is SDF affiliated): not only do they carry the authoritative weight of his "parents", but he's been kept in a bubble where that's the only input he gets: drunk on their propaganda Kool-Aid, so to speak</p><p>That's why he idealized Jin Su and Derek: they're both cited as being presented as heros of humanity which he's been trying to emulate; so much so she's blind to the Mush threat that's been surrounding her this whole time. He's like a dutiful little puppy: having learned a lot of skills, but never really having gained any self-reliance or worldly experience and willing to do anything, even pushing herself to injury or exhaustion, in order to get a "pat on the head", and captures the hearts of all who look at him. You can see this in her skill set (Devotion giving him extra energy/willing to push himself further when the Captain notices/trusts him, Expert showing how he's willing to put success above his personal safety, Polyvalent not giving the "Real-World Applications" of its component skills IE: Points and Actions, Confident showing she's non-threatening enough that even Mush will let their guard slip when talking to her)</p>

                <p>On my first Andie-ship I wanted to go the 'So what exactly is this mush threat everyone is speaking about I've never heard of before'-way you describe but the thing is: Why would you start researching AG then? Because the commander and non biologist tells you to especially do that? Nah rather unlikely. Still AG is pretty necessary (unless mush go the 'Ohh what does mutate do?'-way). <br> <br>Putting his upbringing which indeed was pretty brainwash-y aside many people on Sol never noticed anything about the mush until it was made public. You can go that way. Well<em> if</em> you can. But although he's been no survival artist living in well taken care of institutes instead of the streets his diplomatic skill seems enough to appease some wild Aliens. So why shouldn't he/she be able to put up with what's outside the bubble?</p><p>The problem in being a <em>naive</em> Andie is that rarely anyone stays that way when put on a ship with 15 other desperate people fleeing their homes. It's a bit like Paolas love for Kivanç. Yes she loves him dearly, always searching the XDBs for his voice. And then.... she sleeps with all the old men on board the Daedalus. Is that here taste changing with Kivanç age? Or was their oh-so-strong love always one of the open kind? ^^'</p><p>On the XBD part~ I really would like some sort of Carlsson event. With Andie being responsible for the capture of Carlssons brother (although oblivious to it) I could imagine a very bewildering conversation <em>if Andie becomes Comms Manager and contacts Carlsson</em>. Well I've just become Comms Manager yesterday and our poor Paola RNG be with her (at least next time) already finished comms a week ago. So no more trying.</p>

                <p>With RPing a naive Andie, I guess you could take into account the <em>Mush Research Review</em> book located in the lab at the game's start. Never really bothered reading it, but I believe it mentions about the menace of the <em>mush</em> and that research needs to be done to stop them, or something. Being the book-smart overachiever he is, Andie would be sure to pick up any books he can. This could explain the conundrum of a sheltered Andie going straight for ASG research. This could also open up the ability for someone to go through the process of Andie "growing up" in a social sense, spending time trapped on a ship with 15 other people / <em>mush</em>, and witnessing the realities of life for once. It would be a stretch, but maybe you could assume the diplomacy part comes in from being very knowledgeable about other species and social customs, having studied them in detail as a part of his teaching.</p><p>If I could fit more into the guide, I would add much of this discussion to the role play section, but unfortunately I've reached a character limit.</p>

                <p>Perhaps I misspoke: Its not that he's COMPLETELY blind to the Mush threat (after all, the Federation has trumpeted it as the cause of many problems), but that even being in the den of the beast he was to enamored by her love of the Federation to think it might be vulnerable. If anything, he'd be pursuing the Mush threat with great prejudice, since protecting Humanity is the main goal of the SDF. There's plenty of other stuff you can do to flesh him out though (Fretting about the SDF fighters, licking Jin Su's boots, extoling the Federation, ect.)</p><p>This is my personal opinion, but that's because I'm a big RP fan and a stickler for details on my own part.</p><p>As for some Mush Andie advise, might I suggest mentioning that Andie basically always an excuse to go on expeditions? (Costs no AP, and Polyvalent provides Diplomacy and Botany bonuses), and so Traitor can be a useful skill to pick? Green Jelly is also a decent choice, since you can break down the Grav Sim at the right moment (if you last that long) and throw the ship into a tizzy, or knock out the Research lab to give you an excuse to not research.</p>

Still, I believe it's a good choice as silver with <em>Polyvalent</em>, as it greatly boosts research. Sure, the commander looses some flexibility, but it's rare that I see a commander or a crew that cares too much about the extra 3 AP, and having someone you should give the mission to makes the choice a bit easier. I will agree that the commander should wait until the later cycles to give out the mission. One thing I will say about <em>Devotion</em> is that it does give <em>mush</em> Andie a bit more of a chance to cause some mayhem, as the missions can be saved for a rampage.</p><p>I still personally think that <em>Devotion</em> is a great choice for silver Andie with <em>Polyvalent</em>, but I do see the logic in your argument. The big thing I think that should be stressed with taking this skill is that you make sure the crew speaks up if they need the mission over you, as many commanders will have a hard time not giving it to Andie.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, It just a matter of how much you trust your Andie on the ship. I myself prefer to save the missions I am given because it can allow me to fill in wherever I am needed in case of emergencies. As is often the case, I've had to serve as Expo Pilot because Hua is MIA.</p><p>Besides, When you have a good research Team Andie is maximized by having someone there to relay with him. And the sad fact is, *anyone* can save missions they are given. Including Non-Andie Mush.</p><p>Just not giving him some missions can shoot you in the foot if you have a crafty mush that can play on your fear of Andie being Mush instead of them. It's all a matter of how much trust you are willing to give. Mind you though, if Andie isn't Mush, a smart mush would target them for murder or conversion ASAP.</p>

                <p>Since OP says any input is welcome, and since I saw that people loved it in Stephen's thread...</p><p><strong>Andie's relationships with the crew</strong><br>These are propositions only, based on how I comprehended the characters' bios. Don't just take them and follow, better think your own ways and check them here for some extra ideas<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> They're quite gender-neutral, too.</p><p>You're a generally nice person. So your attitude towards most people will be pretty much the same. Therefore, your roleplay process will <em>depend greatly</em> on the response of other characters.<br>That's why these advices are only relevant to the most narrow and bio-faithful cases (I believe?).<br>Andie is a great character for dynamical play and displaying personal growth. And also for having fun while fooling around with overly formal attitude, or overly friendly attitude, and for being generally hyperactive in the chat. You're the one to be poking people with a stick. Insane shenanigans are also pretty easy to develop. As it was said at the beginning of this thread, everyone can make their own Andie...</p><p>Your Devoted relationships with Commander - whoever he/she is - are going to be special, because this person gives you your vital missions.</p><p>One important note for those who are not playing Andie but have them on the ship. About crew's general relationship with Andie and the attitude towards them. As Andie was a charming person during their SDF years, it would be pretty natural if a significant part of the crew developed friendly, pleasant relations with them. Especially if on your ship Andie is Confid<span class="tid_strike">a</span>ent.</p><p><em>1. Derek.</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"><br>Obvious, huh? The one and only really familiar face in the crew where most people know each other already, and some have been friends for years. And the most anticipated meeting in ages for your orphaned soul. If he is active, he is your golden mine of emotions and drama, or fun and being all chirpy. Father figure or something more? You decide! But don't expect fast and easy resolution, as Derek doesn't remember you at all. Maybe the accident with Finola is to blame. And... What if he is mush and you are not? <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"> You're not going to recover soon from this one...</p><p><em>2. Jin Su</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"><br>If he is active, he is your Commander. Period. You are not very rebellious (yet?), and he is a former SDF, so you gotta listen to him with your mouth open, radiating excitement. Besides, he's a heroic figure. Jin Su would surely love a devoted minion by his side. Keep yourself polite, even if you wanna scream from joy being around him, as he's a superior. ...Or scream from joy. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>3. Gioele</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/hungry.png" alt=":mush_apple:" class="tid_ico"><br>If he's your Commander, you're going to serve him with diginity. Gioele probably wouldn't enjoy your company much. He would like you to stay polite and formal...and a little boot-licking, that millionaire! If he isn't the commander... you can ignore him and his whining and screams. Official position interests you more than money.</p><p><em>4. Paola</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/talkie.png" alt=":mush_talky:" class="tid_ico"><br>A total opposite of you, which could mean attraction of opposites, or constant cat fights. You're going to meet with her at the Comms terminal at trading events, wish it or not, so listen carefully: Paola is a rebel to the bone. She might be the one to cast disillusioning on you, and you might hate her for that. She bears entrielly different values. (But she is as sociable as you.) While you were studying hard, she was setting her pirate radiostation, ignoring uni attendance. She seems to know no boundaries or authorities. (Heretic!) How are you going to handle it? Maybe you'll end up same as her, and you'll be BFFs. Maybe you'll keep arguing about moral values and devotion. Both can be exciting.</p><p><em>5. Janice</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_comp.png" alt=":mush_pa_comp:" class="tid_ico"><br>She has potential to be your cushion...or reverse? She can be the one to hug you and dry your tears after you discover that little red book in the Laboratory... You have lots in common. She's formerly a Diplomate, like you. You digged into communication of living things between each other. She specialises on developing bonds of trust with binary applications. She's the world of new knowledge for you in the field you fancy. Besides, if you're Confident, she's going to talk with you lots, as she's always the one lacking moral support from others. You'll need each other.</p><p><em>6. Frieda</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/laid.png" alt=":mush_laid:" class="tid_ico"><br>Another bridge buddy. She might be interesting for you, as she has unique cultural background coming from 21th cent. Lots of stories to tell during those night shifts. You'll feel respect for her, being older and stuff. She'll probably care for you, no reason for her to be angry with you. Not your key character though.</p><p><em>7. Eleesha</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/discrete.png" alt=":mush_chut:" class="tid_ico"><br>Another one who might tell you lots about the truth and play a significant role in your personal development. Especially since she's honest and straightforward. <em>(So tackle her for conversation if you're the one initiating roleplay, Eleeshas are generally passive.) </em>You might not believe her at first - just a shady yellow-press journalist, no? You might even verbally attack her for badmouthing your precious SDF... Prepare to not only know about Mush, but also about all the crap Federation has done. She and Paola might break your heart with truth. How to react on this, it's up to you.</p><p><em>8. Chun</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/talk.gif" alt=":mush_talk:" class="tid_ico"><br>A mystery which you must discover and unveil. Your Lab buddy. You're going to be quite interested in her. Since you're a highly social person, try paying interest in her feelings and thoughts, not only her pancreatic bacterias or whatever! She has a tough fate, just like you. Stay empathic.</p><p><em>9. Ian</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_garden.png" alt=":mush_pa_garden:" class="tid_ico"><br>A lab buddy and a pacifist. You're not a violent person yourself (remember your healing root thesis and diplomacy mediation thesis?), but not a pacifist either. You both might find lots of things to discuss, from practical advices on gardening to long philosophical conversations. Oh, and what might be your opinion on those phychotropes? <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_garden.png" alt=":mush_pa_garden:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>10. Raluca</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico"><br>Opposite as heck. Anything you say has a chance to annoy her. You might not understand it at first, and will desperately try to befriend her. You might keep and keep trying to find the key to her soul, since you're always interested in establishing communications. Later in the ship, she might need to abuse your Confidant skill, especially if there's no Janice. Take it as your chance if you wanna know Raluca better. Oh, and...don't abuse the cat.</p><p><em>11. Roland</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hunter.png" alt=":mush_hunter:" class="tid_ico"><br>He's a merry and outgoing person, and after you sort out your personal feelings towards SDF spacecrafts out there (some claim they're remote-controlled), you're going to have smooth and friendly relationships. Althooough... You're really naive, so you won't see behind his "practical jokes", if he does them. You're his perfect target. Which might be a little harmful to you.</p><p><em>12. Hua</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/stinky.png" alt=":mush_stink:" class="tid_ico"><br>Yet another good and generous person, and another piloting pal. And a glorious explorer, to feel respect for. You can befriend her easily, especially after a successful expo. She loves having those <em>fruitful</em> expos.</p><p><em>13. Stephen</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/mastered.png" alt=":mush_mastered:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/sat.png" alt=":mush_eat:" class="tid_ico"><br>This one is tricky. A shady guy with shady past who got onto the ship by a serie of accidents. I doubt you're going to like each other. Stephen won't be amused by your naivety, and you'll be disgusted by his deeds. (You won't know them right away, though. Don't just accuse him of things before you explore hime better.)<br>If he's your Commander, prepare for suffering, as you'll have to serve under an opportunistic felon who has no bounds with the crew. You're a dutiful person. At the same time, you probably have your own moral values (they naturally come as the part of your devotion and brainwashing). How can you handle this?..<br>Patches1984 noticed once that Stephen was on Earth right before you were born...what could that mean?..<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/discrete.png" alt=":mush_chut:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>14. Kuan Ti</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"><br>Optimistic in the worst times, he might lend you a shoulder and lift your spirits. <span class="tid_strike">And teach you smoking.</span> But how will he accept the fact that it's a young postgrade SDF officer instead of wonderful prof. Finola? You better proof your high professional qualities. Since Kuan Ti is fabulous, you'll probably like him, and he'll probably like you for being so amicable. But if he argues with Commander, you'll need to choose your side, and naturally it will be your superior... Would be nice to have him as Commander, though, he might even teach you to drop that formal speech at once.</p><p><em>15. Terrence</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_eng.png" alt=":mush_eng:" class="tid_ico"><br>A male version of Raluca, especially for you. Not the one with whom you'll have some chemistry. In case you're overly cheerful or deliberately annoying type of Andie, you might troll him with "right, I'm tolerant towards disabled" and such. In case you're more serious, well...pay interest to his work, maybe the only way to befriend him. What if he responses? Who knows!</p><p><em>16. Mush </em><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><br>They robbed you from "family" (SDF), so the easiest way is to HATE them. <em>(But then again...what if mush are good since they're SDF?..)</em><br>You have your personal reason to develop RFS, as your former comrades might be returned to normal with it. You might also desire for Pheromodem and Mush Language because it's your favourite communication topic.</p>

                <p>Woah this is a blast from the past for me! (Yes I still have this favorited ok?)</p><p>Over time I've kind of started putting myself into Andie, as she's a great one to play around with! I don't really focus on any sort of pre-conceived RP with other characters, as random jumps are just that, random. I have lately since I've returned to mush enjoyed playing as a trans Andie, whether it's Andy or Andie I'm going for. It's lead to a lot of fun conversations so far!</p><p>This is not meant to ignore your suggestions in the slightest, I like where you're going and I might try to incorporate them into my own RP for her. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
