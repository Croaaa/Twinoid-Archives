                <p>Let me set up the scenario. We had a chao that was wreaking havoc on the ship making 'mistakes' torturing people to death, stealing stuff, lying, and was always dirty. Chun killed him in the lab and the body was human. Finola was present as well. I am suspicious that finola is now the former chao. Is that enough suspicion to shoot someone with the natamy rifle?</p>

                <p>Eh, I've had to resort to natamy and every time the mush got super pissed off but I'm not really sure what a better method is. <br>Take my last game for example: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7563" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7563</a><br>Finola had a bed all game and spent 16 AP every day on research, day 4 she picked up the apron and ate a banana. As lame as mush tests are, doing nothing and claiming victory when the ship blows up is just as bad. Finola was the first and only person I tested since I've seen Finolas do that before but it would be griefing if I just killed an active researcher off a hunch.</p><p>The mush hunt went so slowly that Raluca got pissed off, geniused the cure and used it on me without consulting the crew.</p>

                <p>I guess the problem is that the lack of testing cedes the initiative to the mush and gives them an enormous advantage. All they have to do is wait for the right moment to strike and they win.

                <p>I have mulled over the answer you gave and it leads me to the inescapable conclusion that mush is fundamentally broken as a game then. One team is guaranteed to win if they just play stealthy.</p><p>The mush team has the initiative always beacuse humans are not allowed to fight until the mush make thier move. If they just wait fir the right opportunity... Well the humans are doomed.</p><p>Am I missing something? Do the humans have some offsetting advantage i overlooked that provides for a defense against optimal Mush play?</p>

You were going to kill them anyway, whether it was with the Natamy Rifle, a blaster, the knife, etc. It's just the tool you're using to do so. The fact is that the Natamy Rifle can deal up to three injuries per hit, and can kill a gold player at full HP in just two hits - if it deals enough injuries. If you're wrong, the player you hit might as well be dead - they may have up to six injuries from two hits, and it will require a tremendous amount of AP to heal that. That is the main reason we forbid its use for "testing" anyone.</p><p>If you think the Natamy Rifle is the only way to deal with a Mush, you're mistaken. It's the best tool for <strong>assassinating</strong> a Mush, no doubt. But it <strong>does not suffice</strong> as a tool for investigation, and it certainly does not <em>replace</em> an investigation.</p><p><span class="tid_mod">If you don't have enough evidence to justify killing someone, then you don't have enough evidence to justify using the Natamy Rifle.</span></p><p>Also, if you're concerned about how to catch a "stealthy" Mush, there are ways to find them. On my current ship, I caught our second Alpha, and we rushed the RFS to cure her. There was no direct log of any Mushy activity, but she still gave herself away because she was stalling work on projects, despite having AP and clearly being online.</p>

The simple loss of glory means nothing and results in a boring, wasted game after a while because the mush have zero glory and have no reason to play anymore, and the humans cannot win because they are forbidden by SDF rulings from any killing and all their victory conditions are blocked.</p><p>In an ironic twist the game DOES have a 'doomsday clock' but it works against the defensive team.</p><p>There needs to be a better 'disincentive' to the mush than loss of glory.

                <p><cite>On my current ship, I caught our second Alpha, and we rushed the RFS to cure her. There was no direct log of any Mushy activity, but she still gave herself away because she was stalling work on projects, despite having AP and clearly being online.</cite><br>So this is still make a mistake. And if they do no mistakes. Just play as they were humans. If mush really want to get a <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"> it just need to swap in late game with pilot. This is easy way. So they got no reason to do anything or play on mush side. Just wait when hunters got you. Or you kill all crewmates. Random killings is banned too but if mush really play on human side it will be less suspect then human who really become dirty by eating to shoot hunters.</p>

I <strong>never</strong> stated that the human team is forbidden from killing. Nor is it the SDF policy to suggest as such. The humans need to get back to Sol/Eden with no living Mush. To accomplish that, there will either be violence, or death of Mush through environmental means.</p><p>It is Natamy "testing" that is forbidden, because it doesn't count as a legal investigation technique.</p><p>Catch them in lies. Count their AP spent - you can think of this as a "test", but it's investigation based. Watch for stalling tactics. There are plenty of ways to catch a Mush. Most of them involve detailed knowledge of the game, and even the stealthiest Mush can leave behind <em>some</em> trail for you to follow. On an average ship, most humans will get illnesses, or eat twice, or buy a consumable from the vending machine...all things that Mush <strong>can't do</strong>. This ultimately narrows down your list of suspects. If your investigation skills aren't good enough, then learn from your mistakes - and theirs - and get better.</p>

                <p>I played a long Mush hunt right around season change. One Mush was found within a cycle of selection, and the other, a Paola, played the waiting game. However, there are so many ways to confirm humans (and not just by lamely double-eating, though we did have one or two confirmations that way) that eventually we had ruled out everyone else, and cured her on... gosh, it was D8 or D9. Super late, almost embarrassingly so.</p><p>Of course, most of the time that won't work because mush #2 gets paranoid and rampages before you can narrow it down that far. Still, it's actually very hard to play the lie low and wait game against competent humans.</p>

                <p>No, i understood you perfectly. It's forbidden to randomly kill i.e. Griefing. So if you have mush playing like humans, you can't kill because you have no suspects i.e. Random killing.</p><p>You can argue abount random illness etc but then you're only saying the humans will always lose unless they get extremely lucky/unlucky with RNG.You're making suggestions on how to catch mistakes.</p><p>I was addressing the point that if both sides play perfectly, mush will win. If humas make mistakes, and mush play perfectly, mush win. If mush make mistakes but humans play perfectly, humans MAY win if they get lucky finding mush AND fail to get unlucky with random events since the 'doomsday clock' mechanic is backwards and penalizes the defense rather than the offense (in the form of hunters/fires/etc.)</p><p>Getting the fundamental imbalance yet?</p><p>The mush need their own 'countdown' similar to my idea a few posts before.</p>

                <p>On my current ship i have humans playing like mush and mush playing like humans.<br>Reporting it is a broken, unworkable answer. On a random ship chun and or eleesha may be braindead and cHao may be, if not quite a griefer, so inept that he's killed three humans through torture (true story). How the. Am i to know if the mush are just good players able to exploit my handicap or if they're playing against the team. Do i report every game where we haven't found evidnce by day 8? Do you have that kind of manpower?</p><p>This should be error-proof Out with a countdown mechanic. Take away their ability to mimic humans for long periods. No reprts necessary</p>

                <p>Necrodem, i am making logical arguments to a moderator in order to get a game balance issue fixed. You are arguing the same thing but comments about how it's 'sad' threaten nuetrality and invite them to tune us out. Please be careful. HOW you argue can be just as important as WHAT you are arguing for and what you said could be construed as a personal attack and could derail my thread or get it locked instead of its purpose of pointing out a problem and asking for redress. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hello... As a player who has played a lot of ships I can say that the game is very balances as it is and these rules help enforce that. I've played as human and mush frequently. Only ever lost as mush twice. One of which was due to the crew deciding to food test themselves. They managed to murder 5 innocent humans as a result, and I was completely active at the time. I spored, I showered, and I found time to do my job. I could've been caught but the crew wasn't calm enough to take a step back and mull over the information. So I was eventually killed (as well as my partner and my beta) because of the crew. I was upset afterwards because I had worked hard and I bet those humans who (some of which) were perfectly healthy and helpful weren't happy for being murdered.</p><p>Now take your idea of the natamy testing. Mush have their time limit. 80% of mush games start with a tech rush rampage now for fear of the crew instantly running to Natamy. Or maybe the mush decide to continue as is. Okay. Chun picks up the natamy rifle and shoots Roland. BOOM headshot! Roland dies human. 2 out of 16 confirmed! 14 left to shoot... Might as well turn the crew into ducks and have a dog pop up and laugh every time you fail.</p><p>Okay, you may argue that you would only use it when a mush obviously is just pretending to be human... okay... How do you know that? As I mentioned above, I was able to do my mushly duty and remain under the radar just as I manage to do 90% of my mush games. A mush on your ship is experienced enough to confuse you so you turn to your Natamy test. You find a mush, bam dead. Oh wait, that one had anonymush! Lets continue! You've literally just made the mush Rampage right there. You've now made the game into a "who shoots who first". Might as well just give them all guns and put them in two teams and call it Call of Duty. This isn't a fast paced game, it was never meant to be.</p><p>The game was made to be a board game of two intelligent teams facing off. If you've had bad ships then maybe your team was bad. Improvement must be made in your own tactics to compensate. If you can't do that then maybe you'll have better luck with the next game. You've only finished 6 games. You haven't gotten enough experience with the game to truly understand what its about. Stick with it a bit and you'll see why these rules are in place. If, in the end, you still feel it's a problem then there's always castings. You can make your rules there.</p><p>The bottom line is... You have to learn though trial and error on how to be a better investigator.</p>

                <p><span class="tid_mod">The present discussion is getting nowhere, and the original question has already been answered. If you have humans or Mush on your ship that you feel have violated the rules, make a detailed report for us. That's what the report system is for. We read logs, and we do sanction those who don't assume their role as Mush, despite Necrodem's suggestions otherwise. I've handed out more sanctions for that than most of you will ever know, but unless you've actually been part of the SDF, you really shouldn't assume you understand what we know and do.<br><br>We do and see much more than you know, and every report that helps us rein in people who aren't following the rules, is a report that ultimately helps the community. Never forget that.<br><br>The thread's been derailed far enough, and the original topic thoroughly discussed both here and elsewhere.</span> Zombie, you've played 7 ships so far. It's unreasonable to expect you to know everything you need to look for in the Mush hunt. Sometimes you get a crew that is just terrible at investigation. Other times, you'll get Mush that extract a spore in front of a camera and a dorm full of witnesses. The game is actually <em>slightly</em> imbalanced <strong>in favor of humans</strong> at this time (60%-40% human wins to Mush wins.) There are other threads to discuss investigation tactics though, and I'll close down this one as thoroughly discussed.</p>
