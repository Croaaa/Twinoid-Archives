                <p>If you have a technician, try to get pilgred fixed and return to sol as soon as possible given the mushes are dead. The commander can move the ship away from bigger hunter waves in mean time.<br>This is no long-term solution since hunters will catch up at one point. And at one point moving will just trigger same amount or even biger amount of hunters who did follow you the previous cycle. But it may give you several cycles or even days of time to finish pilgred.</p><p>I have no experience with it, but I heard of a ship which used pilot drones to deal with hunters and it worked out well - on a ship which had only few amounts of pilots. You need magnetic net to never loose them though and I guess without any pilot at all, the drones are never sufficient to deal with the hunters in time, unless you have plasma shield and if you help with improved turret power maybe (see below).</p><p>Turrets are normally not very helpful to kill hunters since their base hit chance is 30%, they have only 4 charges and their base damage is 2-4. This may change when you get certain tools to help you: The vending machine project Targeting assistant, researching the lenses, building the sniper helmet, the alien artefact invertebrate shell (a solid person can also easily move this heavy item to another turret when the previous turret's charges are empty), many people with shooter and since new season Paola with Gunner. There is also a research (needs water stick) and a neron project which is strengthening turrets by increasing their charges or making them charge more quickly.<br>The more tools you have, the better turrets are of course, but they may prove most useful to only kill hurted hunters, so when you have at least one pilot left, maybe in combination with pilot drones or see below.</p><p>Killing hunters with patrol crafts without being a pilot (by opening pilot lock) is unfortunately a rather bad idea. Taking off and landing as pilot does not only hurt you, but also damage the ship's hull (I guess you can expect the possibility to loose 4 hull damage when taking off and another 4 damage when landing though it's not always happening).<br>I can imagine it only under certain circumstances a good idea: <br>You have the projects blaster gun, teslatron reservoir, you have tools which are increasing hitting chance like lenses and sniper helmet (they stack) and you use in space ap-booster like eating/accepting missions so all of these charges can be used to hit as much hunters as possible, so many hunters can either be destroyed or their hp can be reduced to at least 2 hp.<br>All remaining hunters can easily be destroyed then by turrets.<br>Afterwards another person is taking off with pasisphae and is using boosters like coffee and rations to collect as much scrap as possible in one go.<br>If you have the oscilloscope you will mostly have enough metal scrap that you are able to fix all or even more damage than your ship received when non-pilots took off/landed.<br>There is also the project Bay Door XXL, whioch should reduce non-pilot damage, but it seems to help not very much to reduce damage on hull.</p><p>So these methods may help, but you will need active people working together. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
