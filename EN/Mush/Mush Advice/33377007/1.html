                <p>One of my friends was playing as a Janice Mush and the ship was able to guess that she was a mush (she sabotarged something in a room with a camera). However the crew decided to keep her alive but under close watch. She was to be confined to one of the dorms and every cycle she had to comfort someone to stop her saving up AP. While keeping her confined, the rest of the crew worked towards the mush cure.<br>My question is, if you are the Janice in that situation, do you have to play along with the confinment and let yourself be cured or do you have to try and wreck the ship despite your confinement?</p>

                <p>Every game I've played in where the remaining mush was outed early and the majority of the crew decided to "let them live" under close supervision has ended with the destruction of the Daedelus. <strong>Every. Single. Time.</strong></p><p><em>Why?</em></p><p>Because the crew grows complacent and after a day or two of watching the mush, they start to ignore and forget about it. And that's exactly about the time things "coincidentally" start going wrong. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Strange, the oxygen resevoir has busted about three times in a row? I wonder how that happened. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Moral of the story is, don't ever make a deal or let Mush live. Kill or cure them immediately or you'll be sorry.</p><p>And the answer to the OP is you definitely take advantage of the foolish bargain and wreck the ship in secret.</p>

                <p>It depends really.</p><p>Pros of keeping mush alive:<br>Killing mush is very time consuming in APs. Some things might be more urgent, like oxygen or morale. Killing the wrong person can literally kill someone else due to morale.</p><p>Some mush cooperate with the ship. Characters like Janice who are passively useful are sometimes worth keeping alive. There was one ship where I suspected Paola of being mush, but because she did all the Xyloph DB stuff efficiently, we let her live.</p><br><p>Cons of keeping mush alive:<br>They will always betray you when things are at their worst. <strong>Always.</strong> In a lot of 'survival' games, the goal of the traitor is to survive. In Mush, the goal of the bad guys is for everyone to die. Your oxygen tanks will break down when there's no oxygen left... Icarus will get sabotaged... people on an expedition will get left behind. And this is the point where you don't have the APs to deal with them.</p><p>Betrayal in Mush can be very effective. I've killed 3 people in a row without even having full APs. It's just plain stupid to keep a high level Chao-mush prisoner. Keep the knife far away from the mush, probably in Chun's hands.</p><br><p>If I were playing a confined mush (like I did on my first ship), I'd play along by their rules to the end. I was mush Jin Su, didn't fly the ship in wrong directions, gave people missions. So people trusted me, because of the unmushlike behavior, even though there was practically 90% evidence pointing to me as mush.</p><p>I ended up backstabbing them when they actually tried to get an expedition down and after knowing that I was mush, nobody dared to go down out of fear of being left behind. The crew died of lack of oxygen. There's always a perfect time to backstab in the game.</p>

                <p>Hmmm, a Janice MUSH, better hope she doesn't have Demoralize. Or is holding onto some spores and you are giving her free access to your group. It never ends well.</p><p>You MIGHT be able to get away with a Raluca MUSH sitting in the engine room working on the Pilgred, but you better make sure that Chun is holding onto the Hacker Kit.</p><p>Best bet. Kill them. The cure is best used as a surprise. Typically used on a Beta MUSH who just got converted. Frankly, the MUSH may sit around pretending to be helpful (and just sabotaging you when you're not looking) until you're about to make the cure. And then they decide it's time to strike.</p><p>By killing them early, you may have to spend a deal of AP. However, it's better early before all the crap hits the fan. You don't wan to spend AP on killing a MUSH when you're running low on O2 and hunters are shooting at you. Especially since the Aracks come later.</p>

                <p>I would never negotiate with humans openly as a Mush. I would normally not even admit to being a Mush, unless the evidence was overwhelming. It just doesn't seem right, compared to going out in a Blaze of Glory. Its kind of like Freddy Kruger agreeing to go to counseling if the hero does not lay his mortal remains to rest after finally finding them. It just seems out of character to use a spore-infected slime monster, chained up in your engine room, to repair your Hyperdrive... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I have a few ideas on getting around the spore sucker test, but they are all situational.</p><p>When you are damaged (shower if needed) and if you can get a mush ally to perform the test on you (if the crew doesn't require Chun to preform the test) then you can have them say that you were at full health before picking up the sucker, then they announce that you are damaged, then heal you and the healing shows in the log. Then they announce you are cleared as human.</p><p>This method is not really that good for a bronze mush, but if you have transfer and at least one person has been infected there are ways to get around it. You can grab the sucker and hide it and bury a bunch of items on top of it to make it difficult to search for, then transfer into another body making sure that your old body is killed quickly (get help from your allies), or if you can spore someone who has already been tested you can transfer in to their body and hopefully remain clear of suspicion for the rest of the trip as long as your old body is killed. But if you are planning to impersonate someone for the rest of the trip make sure you can have the same skills as them. If you are jumping into a level 5 character and you have only level 3 in that character you will likely be discovered. Also make sure you dont to anything that could reveal you as mush before you transfer as when your old body is killed it will be human and you want it to look like a griefer. If you do something like throw the grenade while the setting that prevents humans from throwing it is on, then observant players could realize you were mush at one time and must have transferred bodies.</p>

                <p>Bronze mush can do quite a lot! Tbh, I bought gold when I first got mush but it turns out that most of the skills aren't very effective. If you're planning on rampaging, you only need 2 skills. And you only need one slot for the anonymush trick.</p><p>Spore sucker test can be faked with some social engineering. It's highly activity intensive. You need one person approving that you were clean and uninjured. It doesn't guarantee dirtiness so you can fake that. You can go in injured (just shower!), claim you were damaged by lurching, and ask someone to heal you to full. This will waste their APs and people get cranky when they lose APs. I went into the spore sucker test with about 8 APs and lost all of them in walking, testing and healing people.</p><p>Humans also get surprisingly edgy every time they're subjected to spore-suck testing. Some don't like sitting in a room for ~10 minutes waiting for people to approve them. Some hate that they're getting multiple injuries and people still don't believe that they're not mush. Some think it's cheating and put up a fuss about it.</p><p>Use this restlessness to sneak your way past the checks. It requires a lot of social engineering but when people no longer want to sit there. Just run into the room, declare that you're ready to be tested quickly before you log off. Ask someone to heal you. Once healed, say that the people in the room are witnesses to you not being injured. ("Janice, Stephen, Chun can vouch that I'm not injured"<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Then before someone actually approves you, pick up the spore sucker and drop it and ask someone to heal you. Then put up an argument if someone asks for you to be retested, saying that you don't want to be injured again.</p><p>You can even pretend to log off for a long time (which makes them more restless) and then log back on when the people are no longer in the room. Just say that you ran out of APs testing yourself and healing people. Then ask someone else to come in and certify you. They'll just go "bleh fine you're clear". Also say something about not wanting to be in the room for long in case mush decides to grenade the mush hunters gathered there.</p><p>Another trick you can do is to convince them to do it in the dorm with the shower. Just say that it's to conserve MP when they get dirty.</p><p>It also doesn't work on people who don't cooperate. We didn't spore suck test everyone, just the ones who are acting dodgy. Some people are inactive and sit somewhere all day or log on like once a day. These are impossible to test. You can pretend to be one of those.<br> <br>If you've been quiet and helpful since the start, they might not even bother testing you. When I play as mush, I do my duties well and get trusted because "a person being so helpful to the humans can't possibly be mush".</p><p>If you do get past the spore sucker test, you're likely to be cleared for the rest of the game. Also the people who are certified mush free are excellent candidates to convert...</p>

                <p>Well, there was a bunch of discussion on it. It's not 100% intended to as a way to clear spores; antimush soap is better in every form for that. It could be intended. It's also really time-consuming, and any mush that succeeds in sneaking past it have a significant advantage. I believe the mods are reluctant to voice an opinion on such a gray area, especially when it does add some interesting things to the game.</p><p>It's something like nuclear weapons - devastating, changes tactics completely, shocks a lot of people and creates controversy, but we can still live with it.</p>

                <p>For the record, the whole "Mush Test" issue is still being discussed between the Mods and Judges. It's not something to rush to a decision on, because it's a very nuanced issue.</p><p>As for my <strong>own personal opinion:</strong> Mush tests aren't reliable, and they can lead to more harm than good. They can also lead to the killing of human players who refuse on principle to commit to such tests, which ultimately does more harm than good. If you don't believe me, it is reasonable to assume that anyone who refuses to subject to a Mush Test will be at least under suspicion for the remainder of the voyage...or even killed just because someone says, "Anyone who refuses to take this test will be considered Mush." Sound familiar to anyone? How about this? "Anyone who refuses to take this test will be reported for working against their team." I don't know about you, but I'd refuse to subject myself intentionally.</p><p>If I get sick due to eating something that causes a disease, I can point to it after I'm cured and say, "Hey, at least this proves I'm not an Alpha." This is <strong>very different</strong> than someone mandating a test involving eating spoiled food, with the threat of death upon anyone who refuses to cooperate.</p>

Ask someone to heal you. Once healed, say that the people in the room are witnesses to you not being injured. ("Janice, Stephen, Chun can vouch that I'm not injured"<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Then before someone actually approves you, pick up the spore sucker and drop it and ask someone to heal you. Then put up an argument if someone asks for you to be retested, saying that you don't want to be injured again.</cite><p>That would totally out you to anyone who has a clue to how the test works. To really fake the test you need the log to show you being healed after you pick up the spore sucker. The players that insist on using these tests would probably kill you for that, especially if you made a fuss about not getting tested again.</p><p>No crew who understands how the test works would like it be done in the dorms either as mush can just pick up the sucker and try to shower for damage.</p><p>Although after being put in this situation Im stating to agree that crews who focus on it end up doing it at the expense of other things. No mush is going to let them selves be tested first, if anything they will just pretend to be offline. So by the time a crew actually outs a mush this way they have most likely wasted days of oxygen and neglected planet scanning and projects. And then the mush get violent, then killed, and the remaining crew probably slowly die after that. Which is fine once in a while, but I would hate it if every game turns into this because people so far very few players seem to want to use detective work to catch mush. Most seem happy to rely on a tool.</p>

                <p>Investigation is WAY easier than spore-sucking, though, assuming you can get anyone to do it. Investigation doesn't require people to cooperate or coordinate nearly enough. It doesn't tell the Mush EXACTLY when they are going to be outed, giving them the advantage in acting first. Want to guarantee bypassing the spore-test? Make a point of only being active when most of the rest of the ship isn't. :V Want to avoid investigation?.... good luck with that!</p><p>Other things you can do about suck-test: Transfer. CLAIM a transfer. Shower to get damaged. Have important priorities that need to be done elsewhere, say you'll do it "when you get a chance". Etc. and so on. With the suck-test, the Mush control the rules of engagement - it is not, in any way, the best Mush-hunting strategy for the humans.</p><p>It's a huge drain on the ships survival to actually get it functional, and testing everyone on the ship is unreasonable and practically impossible. The food test and the shower test all have their own limitations as well. No one is likely to get killed for simply refusing to take the spore test.</p><p>(On our ship, if it didn't exist Hua WOULD have gotten killed, because she insisted on acting like a Mush at every available opportunity and rendering traditional investigation pointless)</p><p>I consider the suck-test a final, last line of defense against the "perfectly helpful Mush". The humans can't win with one of those on board, and there's very little aside from Mush-tests that can actually find one.</p><p><strong>Back on topic</strong><br>I think the whole "keeping the Mush alive" thing is perfectly acceptable. Both sides do it because in the end they think it will help them and their team come out on top, so it's not anti-team play in any way. It's just taking a risk for a possible reward. And it could lead to some great RP and twists and paranoia and stuff. So I approve.</p>
