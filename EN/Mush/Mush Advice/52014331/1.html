                <p>I admit, I'm a roleplaying nerd for live. RL RPG is best, MMOs once where good but have become mediocre (xcept for the RP server(s) of LOTRO) - and I love Murder Dinner Parties. So I started out Mush in hope I could get some RP here too.</p><p>But it's hard for several reasons. I've read the Bios and treat the ones I know as - well, people I know. And the rest as Strangers. I avoid to use 'AP' and 'MP' or defining my health and morale in numbers. Which I found out is<br>1. appreciated by other roleplayers<br>2. found annoying by 'effiency driven' players<br>3. suspicious for everyone after the first few days</p><p>Of course I understand 2. and 3. but RP is half the fun for me. I might add that I don't cluster general chat with RP, I keep that for whispered conversations.</p><p>It's just, that I really enjoy it when another crew member starts a whisper with something along the line of: "Sorry to bother you but I have to tell you a couple of things. You got a minute?" instead of "XX is a mush and he has damaged the door in YY".</p><p>Since I only have limited experience with Mush, can you folks give me some advice what level of RP is generally accepted and/or appreciated? And what level I can expect in return?</p>

                <p>First of all I see you are new to Mush, Welcome! For the next bit I need to explain where I come from and my usual modus operandi for when I play Mush:</p><p>I like RP. I grew up with pen and paper games and MMOs. I enjoy games like Mafia and a terrible little game called Space Station 13 - which I see many similariities in between it and Mush. While I don't initiate RP on my ships, when I see another player attempt to talk in character, I will follow suit and do so as well. I think it's fun and adds a bit to the ships.</p><p>However.</p><p>Mush is a social game. So I believe it has the infrastructure to embrace RPing - to a strong extent. But at the end of the day it <em>is</em> a game. One with winners and losers. If you want to roleplay out a little chat where you gradually bring your suspicions to my attention I'm going to view it as indirect and potentially harmful to the crew. Simply because by taking your time with what you're trying to say, or saying it in a passive or indirect way could potentially buy the Mush time to do what they do. When it comes to many ship functions and events (fires, hunters, illnesses, etc.) I think it is fine and largely acceptable to RP reactions or announcements of those so long as you don't delay in the process. But anything involving mush are a different story.</p><p>If I, as Chun, get a whisper from you and you give me this elaborate story about you fixing some orange juice in the kitchen and noticing Stephen has a strange musty smell and following him for a few cycles and seeing him enter one of the storage rooms and <em>blah blah blah</em>, my eyes are going to glaze over and I'm going to want you to get to the point. I'm also going to be less likely to clue you in on future mush-hunt things simply because you could drag down the conversation.</p><p>At the end of the day people play this game for different reasons. Some like the ship management aspect where everyone has their own jobs. You see very effective Friedas or Rolands never say a word but dutifully go about their jobs. This is an example. Others play for the thrill of the hunt. These are players that are/would be fond of games like Maifa where you must sniff out a subversive element amongst you. The players who play more for the hunt are generally (not always) less tolerant of flowery prose and indirect accusations - they will tolerate RP in a public setting, but the second it detracts from the hunt or causes you to because suspicious due to the roleplaying they will be all over you.</p><p>This is not always the case of course. One of the best RPers I've seen in game was a Gioele who became the captain early on, lead the mush hunt, and kept the ship going for a crazy long time - while never breaking character. This is very much the exception instead of the rule though.</p><p>My recommendation? RP away. Feel free to do it all you want in the general chat and even favorited threads. If someone whispers you and RPs with you through a whisper go ahead (this will not happen often though outside of castings, I assure you). But if you whisper someone else to bring something to their attention - do it in a direct OOC setting. Think of whispers as mostly OOC and you'll be fine.</p><p>The only other thing to say is to not let your <em>actions</em> be defined by your character. This is very important and will save you much grief in later ships. Just because you play Derek (or any shooter character) does not mean you grab a blaster off the bat and run around with it the whole ship because it is your "job". Same with playing Stephen and actually cooking. Some actions will get you nailed by the mush hunters quickly, so make sure your actions are not dictated by the persona you are adopting for your character. Keeping that in mind (and the Whisper = OOC thing) you should be fine with whatever roleplaying you wish.</p>

                <p>Very nice post, Steve! I agree with most of it. Heavy, hardcore roleplaying can have its place but not at the expense of the gameplay on random ships. Still, remember that you can just add a brief OOC explanation after your roleplay posts if it gets too convoluted in important situations. As for actually finding ships where you'll get much more than ctrl-w and astropad script spam as a response is an entirely different matter I'm afraid <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I am a big fan of roleplaying in Mush (it's honestly the main draw for me), but I agree that the central part of the gameplay (finding mush, reporting on your job progress) needs to be kept clean and tidy. Sometimes if I need to be extra direct, I'll use ((out of character notation)) so I don't blur the two more than I'd like.</p><p>There's an art to communicating useful game information while staying in character. I always <strong>love</strong> when other players really hit that sweet spot. In-character banter is also lots of fun, though some sourpusses get annoyed at all the messages they have to clear as "read." Sometimes you have to adjust to the crew and keep the essential threads (piloting, research, etc.) free of RP clutter, other times people don't mind. Just try to stay aware and courteous. I've had multiple Commanders who didn't like all the reading on RP-heavy ships, so we made "commander threads" for them to favorite, kept up-to-date with whether the ship needed to be moved and in what direction.</p><p>Though <strong>personally</strong>, if you love bantering, incorporate information from your character's biography, don't play the same tired stereotypes ( "hai guys i'm stoner ian and i have a stash lol" ) and chat me up in PM... I will probably love to reciprocate. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Just take it easy on the PMs if mush are still around.</p>

                <p>Personally I don't mind RP at all in Health and Morale Threads as long as the important information is (more or less) clearly visible.</p><p>Example:<br><span class="tid_wspoil">"I picked up the Apron to avoid dirtiness and worked on Antispore until it was at nine percent and then dropped the Apron again. Now I need one relay."<br><br>"I picked up the Apron to avoid dirtiness and worked on <strong>Antispore</strong> until it was at <strong>9%</strong> and then dropped the Apron again. Now I need a relay."<br></span></p><p>You can use formatting to highlight important information and keep the important numbers arabic(easier to distinguish and easier to read).</p><p>Some threads even beg for some RP in my opinion. Most variations of "Dirty..." are plain boring. You can always tell them how you got dirty. Sure, don't write a whole book about this, but 2-3 nice sentences fitting to your RP instead of "dirty cooking" are very nice.</p><p>It's also possible to RP in discussions. A Frieda, who's torn between CPU Overclocking, because she wants to discover many planets since her childhood and Plasma Shield as she experienced hunters damaging her equipment in the past...<cite>The only other thing to say is to not let your <em>actions </em>be defined by your character.</cite>This means for my example, that you should end up with your real opinion (and ultimately vote for the Plasma Shield) instead of "I'm Frieda, I'm Astro, I want CPU Overclocking!".</p><br><p>Finding a good way to RP can be very difficult as you don't want to switch into efficiency mode(only post numbers and short sentences), but don't want to drag down your ship(team,...) by (slower) RP either. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Both works fine as long as the medic knows the game a bit.</p><p>But if I loose 5 health from the event and I was seriously wounded before so I'm down to 4 health now, I'd not RP around the numbers - unless I've already RPed with the medic about health&amp;wounds and found her to appreciate AND understand.</p><p>Which brings me to something else that was always important from p&amp;p RPGs to MMOs: Never establish a general level of RPing for yourself and fanatically stick to it, always tone the level of RP up and down according to the other players.

                <p>RPing your numbers is okay... But I find it to be absolutely infuriating late game. 1 point could mean the difference from life and death at that point. There are times to be full RP and times to be convenient. You need to balance gameplay with your roleplay. Early game, people don't generally discuss health so that's not important. Late game, though, you should consider just giving you numerics to make it easier on the healers. You take a collapse one cycle and it does just 1 point of damage and you say it's "Just a scratch". You then proceed to go offline and next cycle you take another collapse. Your healer takes note of this but it could be another 1 point damage or it could've been that you took two 3 point damages and now you're at 8 health. I normally will choose to heal no matter what but the thought of healing 2 health is really annoying, especially when AP is in scarce supply late game.</p>

                <p>I don't usually roleplay the numbers, so that the non-roleplaying or just new crewmates aren't confused. I try to prefer efficiency over roleplay so that efficiency-loving players don't start hating the RP-ers.</p><p>It becomes hard when DTT is at the corner. Because I'm often Andie - a silver one without a chitchat option. Sometimes - ocassionally - people just go "knock knock it's DTT time" while I peacefully sleep at medlab. And I can't blame them for that. In terms of gameplay, it's quite profitable! On the one hand, it's efficient to use DTT with someone like me, who hangs out at medlab and almost never sees Janice. And also for someone who "owns" the only private chamber on the ship. But on the other, it's just illogical in terms of roleplay to do it the first cycle you meet a person (or sometimes it entriely doesn't suit the mood I try to play). Leave alone all those gender-related complicacies Andies sometimes face, getting flirting attempts from both women and men.<br>But honestly, that's rare. Not many people just bluntly flirt with me and cathegorically ask for the morale raising in PM, and when they do... well, it's a small challenge for imagination to think up a proper excuse for falling in love with them or something.</p><p>How others deal with DTT in terms of roleplay, I wonder? Most seem to be willing to keep it safe and romantic, though there are different cases indeed.</p><p>Oh, and...It's all different when you do have the chitchat skill. It's all reverse! A sad picture from the long flights: people would rather come talk to you about their own troubles and insecurities (and leave afterwads), than do some mutual warmness sharing, leaving you to be slowly devoured by panic attacks... and despaired enough to jump into anyone's embrace.</p><p>I also have another question for fellow RP-ers, since we have this thread: how do you deal with the issue when people confuse the bios or don't know their details? Correcting them, or getting along with their own picture of the characters? (I do the latter, except when asked by the player to clarify their own bio for them.) It's quite a common situation to mess up something, because bios often have additional facts about other characters, so it's not enough to read only about your own. And some things are clearly up to imagination. Maybe we need something like a "who knows whom, who worked on what" chart.</p>

                <p>When it comes to <strong>handling DTT</strong>... actually, I almost never manage to do that onship! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> So far I've managed to work it into RP to my satisfaction when I have, though. Once was as a Chun who "met Kuan Ti for drinks" nightly in the medlab. OOC we were shooting for D20 and trying to get me pregnant before the ship was over, but it was pretty casual IC, and I was fine with that. More recently I was a lonely Derek who accidentally stole Jin Su's girlfriend when she fell for me instead, which was a lot more involved RP-wise. Cute, though. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In the end I'm also willing to treat DTT as "hugs" or "cuddles" if it better fits the RP mood. Or just dial it back to casual IC flirting if the other person is not RP-minded and clearly doing it because of morale mechanics. Like so many other things with roleplay, you kinda have to just go with what fits the current story. In that Derek example from earlier, I actually "wasted" several days of valid DTT because of the RP element, and morale was in a comfy enough place that it wasn't a stupid mechanical decision.</p><p>Now, in regards to <strong>biography details</strong>, I tend to roll with what the other person offers. They may have fleshed out the character in their mind and altered a few background details to fit, and I don't want to be so quick to shut them down - fellow RPers are precious! I'd probably question them in character ("Hm, I thought they told me you ---" ), because it gives them a chance to present the alternate stuff they've worked on... or correct their mistake. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Quick, OOC PMs for clarification could also help in the case of alternate histories and how that affects whether my character should still be familiar with yours.</p>

You may want to check out the <a target="_self" href="/tid/forum#!view/134976|thread/42298066">Casting Forum</a> and see if any of them catch your eye.</p><p>You can also see if there are any fun RPing players on your ships and ask if they are in a certain casting and that way you can personally get a reference from them to speed up the recruiting process.</p><p>That being said, we are not liable for the risk of you getting hooked on RPing and will not provide compensation for any amount of <em>crazy Schrodi-licking fun</em> you experience and all the <em>out-of-this-world friendly and awesome people</em> you may encounter during your RP-induced high. You have been warned.</p><p>Oh and the <strong>post-it's</strong> are amazing as an RP tool, please use them! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>
