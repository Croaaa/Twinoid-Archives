                <p>Big and good guide. Still have something to say about some statements:</p><p><cite>Shrink gives you bonus efficiency to the NERON Participation project. But you donâ€™t want to pick that project. Really.</cite><br>Actually you do want, if your ship has bronze/idle/killed Raluca and not too powerful project team, who will make projects more then 10 days on their own (most of random ship btw). NERON participation will finish 4-5 projects on its own then. If round with NERON participation happen fast and other two projects are not too good, it will help you greatly.<br><cite>Diplomat - This skill is a must have for Eden runs.</cite><br>A bit overrated description in my opinion. Especially when you began "check Andie" part. 2 of 3 Eden runs here went just fine without Diplomats. Don't forget you remove Combat not only to increase Artifacts and Map pieces outcomes, but also Item lost or Mush trap events.<br><cite>Before D10, 7-8<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_pmo:" class="tid_ico"> is more than enough to leave everyone. </cite><br>And then mush rampage, kill Janice, Chun and few more humans and the rest begin to put the end of that... Don't make mush life easier and don't give them free wins. Some ap of one generast will not change much. More humans, who survived after mush moves - will.<br><cite>CPU Priority - projects</cite><br>As you can change it as often as you want now, Janice is a great reseter. Coordinate with any person to work in nexus together, reseting to each other with 10-12ap each. Go to nexus, switch to CPU to projects, do your 10 moves, switch CPU back. You just got 10-20% more progress. Also it's +1-2% not +1% for research or projects.<br><cite>Crew Lock - unlocking piloting</cite><br>Add something about coordination with team about not-pilot collecting scraps, generalist launching Icarus when pilot is in room. It really can help a ship, which has problems with skilled pilots. Ofc not switching that for cycles, but just for few minutes, after speaking in privite.<br><cite>Inhibit DMZ-CorePeace = OFF</cite><br>Also makes quite all NERON messages much more funny!</p><p>You guide aimes very much on ideal ships (playing too much MMM, huh?). Where you have a lot of people with each important skill, where mushes do nothing to hurt humans. Add something about how Janice can help in emergencies. And ofc - how to play Janice as a mush will be nice too.</p>

                <p><cite>Actually you do want, if your ship has bronze/idle/killed Raluca and not too powerful project team, who will make projects more then 10 days on their own (most of random ship btw). NERON participation will finish 4-5 projects on its own then. If round with NERON participation happen fast and other two projects are not too good, it will help you greatly.</cite>The assumption I made was the Janice in question being part of said team. With IT Expert and BIOS manipulation, she's powerful. The projects team also consists of the technician characters. If you happen to not have any, then you have bigger things to worry about than streamlining projects. <br>Another problem with this project is that it needs to appear early on for it to have an effect. Keep in mind, if your projects are going <em>too</em> slow, you're also going t be cycling through the pool at a slower pace. Ex : you find NERON Participation in the third projects batch but by the time you complete, it's D6 and you're about to return.<br><strong>Most importantly</strong>, this project can screw up your ship if a n00b or a griefer starts NERON off with the wrong project and it's left unchecked for a few cycles. If your projects team is not 'powerful' and constantly in the nexus, you are more vulnerable. Racing NERON to 100% is not a position you want to be in.</p><p><cite>A bit overrated description in my opinion. Especially when you began "check Andie" part. 2 of 3 Eden runs here went just fine without Diplomats. Don't forget you remove Combat not only to increase Artifacts and Map pieces outcomes, but also Item lost or Mush trap events.</cite>For what it's worth, 4/4 of mine had diplomat. But you're right, I should probably tone it down a bit. <br>I admit the Eden thing is a bit badly written. On expo-happy ships <em>in general</em>, it's a really good skill to have since it reduces a lot of chaos. Fight damage is spread over the crew randomly, not evenly like fatigue. It's possible for the same person to suffer most of the damage and die, especially if you're visiting multiple fight zones. Mush traps and accidents are much preferred over these. Cristalite fights are a whopping 18 strength.</p><p><cite>And then mush rampage, kill Janice, Chun and few more humans and the rest begin to put the end of that... Don't make mush life easier and don't give them free wins. Some ap of one generast will not change much. More humans, who survived after mush moves - will.</cite>The thing is, I've had Janice-targeted rampages done to me a few times by mush and griefers alike. The only time a person died of depression from this was after we killed 3x multiteamer + 2x Alphas + 1x innocent human. These ships don't happen very often but when they do, it usually crawls back to Sol before anyone active dies. It's an extremely ineffective tactic and frowned upon in the community.<br>Don't underestimate the Constipaspore Serum. Phagocyte is a staple to successful rampages and Constipaspore prevents mush from using it for the instant AP. Better still, it hurts the mush regardless of what the mush choose to do. This where I put my generalist AP.<br> Also, there are several things one can do to minimize rampage damage. Securing the weapons, for example.</p><p><cite>As you can change it as often as you want now, Janice is a great reseter. Coordinate with any person to work in nexus together, reseting to each other with 10-12ap each. Go to nexus, switch to CPU to projects, do your 10 moves, switch CPU back. You just got 10-20% more progress. Also it's +1-2% not +1% for research or projects.</cite>Thanks for pointing out the 1-2% <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br>I'm hesitant to add the bit about changing it constantly though. It works for me but it's supposed to be broken. I don't want people reading my guide and having it stuck on something undesirable because it may not work for everyone.<br><cite>Add something about coordination with team about not-pilot collecting scraps, generalist launching Icarus when pilot is in room. It really can help a ship, which has problems with skilled pilots. Ofc not switching that for cycles, but just for few minutes, after speaking in privite.</cite>That was already in there <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><cite>You guide aimes very much on ideal ships. Where you have a lot of people with each important skill, where mushes do nothing to hurt humans. Add something about how Janice can help in emergencies. And ofc - how to play Janice as a mush will be nice too (ye, you have big guide about playing mush in general, but some advices for Janny will be good here).</cite><span class="tid_strike">My motto is, if it's not an ideal ship, get to work turning it into one</span> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>Mush Janice tips are coming soon.

"Oh, there was Janice in nexus, reseting...could she be mush and made a trap? Nah, she is just bronze - she could not make a trap and then take no damage from shower.... Let's access terminal....Welcome, dear mush...."<br>- You don't want Diplomat as mush in most of the ships. You will be forced to go to every expo. And Illness event will make you killed instantly. Same for Mush Trap with modem online. Avoiding expoes can be a way, but you rise suspicion without reason.<br>- You don't want to do anything useful for human team. Yes, sometimes you want to look like human and work...but really better just spend your 8-16ap a day (and they will see you used everything) then spending 8-16ap+2IT+giving passive bonuses</p><p>Those skills, taken by mush-Janice don't hurt <strong>that much</strong> as Gioele skills. But still they help your enemies. If you want ceasefire or good hacking - take a skill just before using it, not at the start.</p>

                <p><cite>- Shrink. Must have on every single ship.</cite><br>Ofc <strong>humans</strong> want a Shrink on every ship. But you are mush, you don't need to give them anything they want. I played as IT expert mush Janice a few ships and was not killed for that. Be creative in chat, make life of humans pain and laugh how they put the end of that. Still it's quite risky and doing things like that often will not work, so I suggest taking Shrink as the only skill for gold mush Janice.<br><cite>Also, with 50% chance to hack terminals Janice can easily hack the ship and abandon the expo.</cite><br>That's why, if you want to hack, you can take IT expert right before hacking - if you hacked and left expo you are revealed anyway. And people who do AP counting can just expect +4ap a day (+8 on day you joined) if they see IT expert.<br><cite>Diplomat. Must have on every ship that wants to go to Eden.</cite><br>But you are mush, why should you care about that? Only 1 of 9000 ships of english server got to Eden with mushes.<br><cite>The Ceasefire ability is also extremely useful for Mush.</cite><br>Yes. That's why - again - you can take Diplomat just before using the ability, not from start.<br><cite>Diplomat + Traitor combo is also viable, since Diplomat always takes the compass. </cite><br>If you are going to do that - then you are right. But if you use any other tactics - then you don't need Diplomat.<br><cite>-NERON's only friend. Not the best skill for Mush, but can be useful for rushing easy projects with Plasma Shield.</cite><br>Oh great, do you really suggest to take more skills to help humans do projects better? Are you really playing for mush side? Even if you have a clear way for Sol return (like mush-Raluca with Tech+Phys who want to rush PILGRED with you), you still don't need to give any bonuses - humans will not see you less suspicious for having NOF, just "mush or human she was given that skill from the start as she is gold with lvl 4".</p><p>I can agree, then lvling up Janice to lvl 5 just to have option to drop skills while playing mush on gold takes a lot of exp and most of players don't want to spend it. But if you have option - to take or not to take these skills (for example you started the ship with gold days off and then activated them) - better not to take.</p>

                <p>Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I find counting APs to be next to impossible on most ships. Maybe in a very active/organized ship it's possible, but usually there are several inactives and several who speak once a day or not at all. How am I supposed to keep track of everyone's APs? I have my own job to do, the best I can do is try to keep an eye on one or two suspicious people and try to get a general feel of who's acting mushy.</p><p>I've never been mush Janice, but I imagine that IT Expert can really help you deflect suspicion with the free actions that you can report every day, making it look like you're being helpful. Of course on very active and organized ships with hardcore mush hunters this isn't going to fool anyone, but in my experience for the majority of ships the humans have a tough time keeping organized. Anybody who seems to be helping has a chance to fly under the radar.</p>

Maybe in a very active/organized ship it's possible, but usually there are several inactives and several who speak once a day or not at all. How am I supposed to keep track of everyone's APs? I have my own job to do, the best I can do is try to keep an eye on one or two suspicious people and try to get a general feel of who's acting mushy.</p><p>I've never been mush Janice, but I imagine that IT Expert can really help you deflect suspicion with the free actions that you can report every day, making it look like you're being helpful. Of course on very active and organized ships with hardcore mush hunters this isn't going to fool anyone, but in my experience for the majority of ships the humans have a tough time keeping organized. Anybody who seems to be helping has a chance to fly under the radar.</p></cite><p>AP counting is best done as part of a fairly large team, with people in the dorms or passing through them noting who leaves beds and comes back to them, people tracking roomlogs of lab, Nexus, and bridge, ideally when they go to work on something there anyway. Also people watching near the start of cycle changes for counting how many hunters have appeared, then after pilots fly counting how many are left, and comparing these and roomlogs to what people report in the threads about progress on different things. The wiki can be used to show you how much progress on research and projects each person should get; that can be compared with the roomlogs to see if someone who doesn't report their progress and appeared to access a terminal actually did work or not.</p><p>When people have IT points or whatever other skills that affect their participation in things, you factor those in your analysis.</p><p>Some ships I don't attempt to AP count at all. Others I feel like I know what almost everyone is probably doing - the difference is in the actual other players on that ship with me, how determined and experienced and participating those are (enthusiastic cooperative newbies who can be on a lot are as useful and delightful as pros who know what to do, want to do it, and are on equally as much, but experienced players who disagree with those methods and attempt to make it harder to track AP usage make it harder to do for sure).</p><p>Some times it comes to statistical analysis; Jin took off and killed 3 of 7 hunters, we don't have lenses or any upgrades to fighter damage or the project that reduces the cost to launch; how much AP did he spend doing that? (answer is, if he aimed, between 9-11 AP, with about 75% likelihood it fits into that range; so if Jin was in bed for the last 6 cycles, took a ration with him and claims he used all of his AP.... he's probably lying, but if he didn't aim (check at a turret to see if many of the surviving hunters are hurt) then he was probably telling the truth and lucky to get 3 kills... better explain aiming to him.)</p><p>But yes, on many ships, even the AP counting ones, being 'no more mushy then the other 3-6 mushy humans' is generally good enough to buy you lots of time.</p>

                <p>Diplomat is not better. Shrink is important for any ship to survive, Diplomat is needed mostly only for bonus objective called Eden (still I reached it twice without Diplomat without any problems using just 9 expoes each time). Most of combats have power of 10-12 (Insects, Predators, Cows, etc). For team with 4 people+basic 3 weapons they are less dangerous then accidents (which happens with or without Diplomat).</p><p>The best thing about Shrink: it's easy to use with every cryo-brained unactive and not communicating team and it gives a lot of morale - 16-24 per day for free. Leader can replace Shrink, it can give even more morale per day, but only if others help you to make speeches for a lot of people at once.<br>Also it's the only normal way to cure disorders. Once I played for pilot-Hua, who was afraid to fly and Janice was dead (I got that disorder while watching how mush killed her). It was really sad.</p>

The problem with your plan is that you depend on having a bad crew, If i saw an IT expert only janice sitting in the nexus doing 2 relays a day .... I would tell everyone to avoid the nexus and rush mycoalarms after ASG &amp; C.Serum - I would do that if you were mush or human since a mycoalarm in the nexus would be useful to either save you or whoever relays you .</p><p>After 1 day change I would be <strong>very</strong> suspicious of you because you not only have a chance of being an alpha mush but also a chance of being a beta mush from sitting in an unprotected room. Likewise I wouldn't really care if someone killed you - it's not like we lose a shrink. You have a viable strategy but with a decent crew its a bit more risky than Neron's guide.</p>

                <p>Not taking Shrink was suggested just as one of options, actually for one, where you will act <strong>after</strong> getting suspecious, but <strong>before</strong> humans take you down. <br>The main reason of that post wa - no need to take all 4 useful for humans skills, if you are mush:</p><p>1) Or you take only Shrink instead of Shrink+IT+NOF+Diplomat - you will be valuable to team not to be killed with strong reasons anyway, but give them much less benefits</p><p>2) Or, if you want to use some kind of rush tactics - take just IT. <br>Example of tactics (just example!): Wait day change - remove camera in any dorm, put 2 spores on any human (before and after day change) - partner can add the 3rd. Then demoralize Chun if she is MOH, take the cat, hide behind ceasefire, get 6 more ap. Demoralize Jin / KT / Andie if they have skills to restore morale. If they don't - demoralize active players, or people with other important skills. Switch bios, take off with cat and important items - you can even take banana trees.<br><span class="tid_wspoil">No, you cannot kill the cat. Nobody is allowe to kill the cat. Saving cat is the most important thing in the game. In any game.</span><br>Result:<br>- All morale sources lost<br>- You are killed, but another mush replaces you<br>- Maybe your partner can even hide in anonymush now (especially if you got Eleesha demoralized or spored)</p><p>Trying to play long game as mush-Janice with IT is really too risky.</p>

                <p>Oh, it was under spoiler as some kind of joke. Killing cat work better then stealing, I just love cats so much, then cannot kill him even in game (until it's absolutly necessary to win as a mush, I prefer just to make plan where it will not be needed).<br>Anyway - to kill the cat you need blaster (which can be kept/hiden), also you need 1-3ap, depending how good your aim is. If killing Raluca is not important for you (she is idle, your partner, or your partner wants to lie low under anonymush, while they rush PILGRED before putting the end of all that) - then there is better use of that ap.</p>
