                <p>i just read this:<br><cite>"You start with another Mush, but expanding to more is always good! Contaminate the whole crew, one Icon Anonymush at a time, and NERON will end the game for you by venting everyone into space. It never could stand the dirty Mush." <br></cite><br>lets assume the 2 alpha mush managed to turn all humans still alive into mush `, like for example 12 Mush, 3 dead humans and chun alive.<br>and then the mush team want to infiltrate eden . but they need at least 1 human on board.</p><ul><li>how do they proceed with chun? , what can she do and not do with her alone against 12 mush, what are her options? or better asked: what are the options the mush will/can give her? <br>and is there any way to keep her Alive (against her will possibly because: yes, her death means the mush wins anyway , BUT they all die in space and not get the chance to infiltrate eden) and please lets ignore the fact that they can infiltrate sol because that takes only few days of work to repair pilgrid, but on the other side going to eden may take 10 days which forces the mush to keep a human alive for a long period of time. what is the best thing the mush team can do to reach their goal?</li></ul><p>NOW if keeping chun alive isnt possible and she will die fighting, but the mush team has chun ghost in lab and she is still alive but may die any day now:</p><ul><li>can the mush team finish the Serum by asking one to suicide (get killed) to give a mush corpse, and then another mush volunteers willingly to get cured to help his mush team infiltrate Eden and by the time he gets cured he does nothing against mush because he was a mush in the first place and volunteered to help his team achieve a much higher better victory?</li></ul><p>i know its very difficult to keep humans alive who just want to kill you , so obviously the mush have no choice but to turn all humans other than chun to not have them around throwing punches.</p><p>i am not sure if this has happened before but i would like to know all options possible that could lead to infiltrating eden with maximum mush team.<br>thanks</p>

                <p>Ok this raises more questions:</p><p>Why isnt it an option for the mush to infiltrate eden without the humans (just one human chun) thinking that the mush are dead? The mush can make the humans watch while they destroy their new home and everyone in it. That is more evil and cruel than just killing them. Isnt it?</p><p>Mush can take control of the entire ship within the games rules and skills , find eden starmap and go there , there is nothing that says in the games goals : dont go to eden unless you go there secretly . <br> whats to stop them if they find a way to get around getting vented into space to make more damage to human race?</p><p>That is my reasoning for why its a good idea to turn the entire crew not just few hidden ones.</p><p>As for my second question i would like to hear more opinions about the volunteer mush to be cured to avoid venting in space and allow eden infiltration. And i am more interested in the case that only chun is left from humans and rest are all mush.</p>

                <p>Generally, intentionally switching the team is seen as playing against one's original team. This works both ways - mushes volunteering to get cured, humans intentionally triggering traps trying to get infected. Both of those are reportable and sanctionable.</p><p>Of course there is a very tiny black-gray-ish area of situations where it would be beneficial for a player's original team to have one of them switching the team. But that has an issue of converted person being on the new team, afterwards, and being obliged to thwart any plans that their original team had. And since they are usually very well informed about the plan and know most or all the tricks that their original team has up their sleeve, it shouldn't be hard for them.</p>

They are, per se, parasitic fungus that gets sentient only when inhabiting body of other sentient being. I don't think they have some kind of moral stance on things that are essentially question of surviving and reproducing themselves. Calling them evil seems same like calling mistletoe or common flu evil.</span></p>

Yet, there are still ships who start on an orbit of rubbish planet and the only effect of this season setting for them is a need to load fuel, deorbit and start scanning for planets in later days then they'd like to. And I'm not even talking about ships where someone hijacked an Icarus and crashed on starting planet because there was not enough time for crew to organize themselves before their first expedition.<br>I'm sure it is more or less same with every aspect of game mechanics. There will always be bigger or smaller subset of scenarios when something you have hard time to imagine as beneficial, actually will be beneficial. Or beneficial for some goal that you never considered as a goal someone might want to actually achieve. As I said, people are terribly creative sometimes.</p><p>As for cheating, yes, I agree, I personally feel it the same way. But still have some buts about this. Which I think would be better to discuss in SDF part of forums then in public <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Gotcha.</p><p>I just would’ve described the situation in discussion in a bit different way:</p><p>1) Since mush is RNG-based – there might be cases where you end up either getting a positive or a negative outcome from the same actions, depending on how the dice rolls. So yes, benefit could be ambiguous for chance-based actions for some situations.<br>2) Same actions might look like an effort of spoiling while in reality it was an effort of gaining a benefit – you just can’t know which one it is without having access to corresponding logs/conversations/etc, in other words – don’t have a full picture of what has happened. Gameplay actions, that is. That should be taken in account as well, of course.<br>3) Those first 2 cases describe actions that are, let’s say, “variables” and <strong>depend</strong> on the circumstances. BUT! There’s a set of actions that are “constants” and always have a negative outcome for your team or both teams, <strong>regardless</strong> of the circumstances. Such as, for example, pathetic suicide or volunteer curing/getting converted on purpose. Why I classify them as constants is because they’re nothing but examples of giving up playing the game (in general or specifically being a member of a team you are part of) and spoiling it for other players, or an attempt to play the game not as intended. Those things are considered unacceptable and whatever the circumstances are – giving up is still giving up. And there’re no hypothetical circumstances that are capable of changing the constant’s value, without overriding the whole meaning of what “constant” is :B</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">PS: The example you gave with the starting planet is just an option of environment setup. Configuration options are not beneficial or harmful on their own – they just give players a chance to get some benefits or add some risks into the game.</span></p>

                <p>Iz, my point is that difference between your 2) and 3) might be very subjective sometimes. At least in situations when the rules are kept vague and don't give much examples of sanctionable plays (which I fully understandand why it is so).</p><p>I'll give one more example: Just last ship we had a situation when mush removed camera on bridge with four other poeple there and suddenly beta appeared on status bar. Only one of those people was online, Janice. She alarmed the crew and helped kill mush. Then she assumed she's confirmed because "no mush would dennounce another mush, as it would be playing against one's team." We repeatedly explained that as possible beta she might have sacrificed her alpha (maybe even with alpha's approval) for gaining trust, so she's still not confirmed. Janice's player accepted it but had really hard time understand how that could be done within the rules. For them, something that was 2) (situational) was felt as 3 (constant). And they had no frame of reference other then their crewmates' claims to know whether they are right or wrong.</p><p>I mean, sometimes we can rely on our gut feeling when it comes to question what is against the game's spirit and what's not. Other times... it's not so easy. And as long as we don't want to pinpoint every last one possible transgression of rules, we have to keep in mind that some people might feel otherwise about something we think is a given constant.</p>

                <p>There are a lot of things that are situational and subjective in this game, but what team you are on at the moment is not one of them.</p><p>AFAIK, a mush voluntarily subjecting him or herself to the RFS is against the rules, as is a cured-mush-now-human going to trigger traps or coordinate with his or her former team to become Mush again.</p><p>Yea, situationally and circumstantially, you might concoct a way for a Mush team to find benefit in converting one of their own to human, whether they stay human or are converted afterwards. Perhaps you do it behind their back, or you do it so they can't react quickly enough for the short time they are human if you are converting them back... But if you're plotting to convert one of your own team to human behind their back and against their will, you gotta' ask yourself how much you all are valuing that member of your team as a member of your team, since you are basically amputating them from the team.</p><p>From an RP perspective, I imagine any Mush in their right (hive)-mind would never agree to be cured (killed, essentially), for some petty gain, even if they were assured their human host would be newly infected soon thereafter, or they were assured that they would be overpowered by the remaining Mush and an Eden Victory was in the cards.</p><p>Not to mention, NERON assassination is META-knowledge, meaning none of the characters aboard the Daedalus actually know that NERON will self-destruct when all humans are eliminated. The humans don't know this will happen, the Mush don't know this will happen.</p>

                <p>Patches, yep, I got your point and agree with it besides just that one part - exactly that the difference is very clear regarding the 3) type of cases, imo. For example: while dying due to picking up a cat isn’t always pathetic suicide [[player could’ve been in need of morale and at low health, but have no options for getting medical assistance or AP to do it themselves, so it's either trying to fix morale with risking HP, or just dying for sure at daychange; and on the other hand - if they die due to picking up a cat 28 times – well.. yeah..]], - voluntarily getting cured/converted isn’t anyhow vague – it’s not a ..mm.. generalization of any kind: you might not know if it was voluntarily or not, but if it was - it is against the rules regardless of the reasoning – it gives the rivalry team an advantage which is against the defined mush/human game aim. There just isn’t any space for interpretations. At least, I can't find any.</p><p>To put all I’ve said shortly: while there’re cases that are vaguely stated – mainly because it’s just impossible to specify all the situation that are classified as such (as playing against ones team), – there’re cases that aren’t ambiguously at all, so implying that there’re might be situations when doing those things is okay would be misguiding.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">I’m awful in explaining my thoughts, aren’t I?

There just isn’t any space for interpretations. At least, I can't find any.</cite><p>My issue is that there's no (easy to found, not sure about some random message in middle of one of three Ask SDF threads) rule that says "it's unacceptable to voluntarily getting cured/converted." In SDF Rules and Information post there are two rules that are concerning this:</p><p>~ Do not play against your team.</p><p>and</p><p>~ Do not commit suicide, surrender or otherwise give up on the ship.</p><p>First one of those covers most of standard scenarios, but doesn't take into account that there <em>might</em> be scenario when, just from the point of view of usefulness, your current team might actually benefit from your conversion. Because in that moment this rule might be overridden by that benefit, in the mind of players. After all, it is that team that needs one of them converted. How could it be playing against one's team when <em>all the people</em> on that team for some reason want you to get converted? Of course, there's a thing that it is against the <em>idea</em> or <em>concept</em> of that team, how it was meant to be by devs. But that is the mental step that can't be expected from each and every player. Players are not here to interpret rules and reason about them, they are here to play according to them, in environment created by those rules.</p><p>Second one is better, but is less direct, more "behind the corner," as we say in my country. Again, it expects players to do necessary mental steps to understand that changing team is akin to letting their character die and getting new one, with new team. And again, it is not readily intuitive way of thinking about situation.</p><p>In this light, I can easily imagine some ship full of mushes trying for mush Eden, who just lost Chun to panic attack, thinking along the line "oh, damn, we lost last human, we need to make our own." not with intent to abuse game mechanics but more like trying to find creative solution for their goal. They looked at the rules, they don't see it as playing against their team (team needs one human alive to reach Eden), they don't see it as suicide (no one actually dies, converted player is still with them), and if there's no one alive who read this one discussion, thy simply don't know any better. If I were to judge such a report from deceased Chun, I would probably clear it the same way as I clear the newbies who picked up weapon pre-selection and didn't know they shouldn't.<br>Well, probably with exception of converted character, if there were no evidences of them trying to thwart mushes.</p>

I dunno who, when, or where. But I think you're all looking at it the wrong way. You are describing a Chun who deliberately injures themselves and deliberately interferes with anyone trying to help her stay alive. This doesn't hurt the Mush team. If Chun dies, the Mush win. Chun is spending the human team's time, energy, and resources to influence HOW the Mush WILL win. This is <strong>not</strong> playing for the human team, this is just promoting a Mush win. Human team loses when all the human's :hp:'s run out, why the hell would a Chun be removing human :hp:'s, it makes no sense. Chun needs to play for her team, here.</p><p>Consider this: If Chun wants to hurt the Mush team, she should injure the Mush and not the last remaining human. <strong>That</strong> is what gives humans a chance to win. Perhaps it's a small one. But perhaps the Mush are so idiotically hellbent on winning the way they want to that they end up throwing the game. That's why it's risky for the Mush.</p>

It happenend and there can be only PUUUUUUNISHMENT TIME PUHUHU~~<br><cite><br>and here dont judge them for wanting that distinction. that is what they like and no one can tell them what their goals should be (am i correct?). that is the beauty about having over 100 ways to have a mush victory right? if you forbid one type of victory we might as well forbid mush from killing chun while we are at it and you dont even get distinction for killing chun, BUT you get a very rare one which requires a lot of effort if you infiltrate eden.<br><br>[so in order to get all that , that mush guy that no one likes (i changed it from the guy who volunteers to be cured to the guy who got converted last , and no one likes him and the team is more than happy to through him under the bus so no one would come and say "you cant do that..." ) has to get cured in order for the mush team to reach their goals because if they put their faith in Chun not breaking the rules and suiciding they lose the experience they are looking for.</cite> <br>Still cheatin' for me. You don't earn the right, You just find a way to buy yourself more time in not very fair way. But welp, not your fault someone's inactive. Unless You know, they will be.</p><p><cite>i am btw just having fun with my imagination here , one day maybe this will happen and its good to know a bit more about it now than later...</cite></p><p>Sure it is nice. Just don't try to find grey zone here pal. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Also decide is it either goal to get mush eden ending or +20 days as mush, because I don't think so You will find people trying to get both same time, as mush eden is more... rare. Especially with RNG God like this.</p>

                <p>Patches, <br>Oh.. but I thought we've both agreed that particular case (I'll even make it more general and say: the case when all the players agree on playing their ship otherwise than the game is expected to be played) is cheating?

                <p>Yes, I totally agree that it is cheating. But that is about how I personally feel about fairness of gameplay. Not how I understand that the rules explicitly say it.</p><p>With that, for me, as a judge, it's similar as aforementioned newbie holding weapon before mush selection - it is against the spirit of rules, it gives someone unfair advantage, and if I saw such situation ship-side I would strongly warn people doing it. But on the other hand, if I saw report where the guilty side demonstrated lack of knowledge about the rules, and I wouldn't see reporting player explaining why what they are doing is bad, I would clear that. Simply because it would be against my own code of not punishing people who are doing something they genuinely believe is alright. Actually, I see this as even less transgression then those pre-mush held weapons - there are literally no victims (humans would still lose, mushes would still win, just their victory wouldn't be so great), and rules are less clear about this then about neutral play.<br>...which is probably good thing as that means those things are not happening and thus there's no need to make specific rules for that :-)</p>

                <p>By 20 days i meant not aiming for a high day , but just the fun experience we spend during 20 real life days trying to reach a goal for our team working with people trying to fight getting detected during converting all humans then fighting the odds to stay alive long enough to find 3 starmaps. All that effort and experience could be very fun and very few could experience because its mush trying to do it , not the humans. Glory in my perspective gets totally ignored in mush eden because mush wins with having 0 glory if they infiltrate eden , so low glory wont change the fact that we spent 15 to 20 days having fun fighting the odds and getting rewarded in the end with something rare not easy to get. But you are correct. I was was actually talking about ranking for most mush eden distinctions.</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_12346 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="12346">Veren</span></span><cite><p>what you are saying here is that, for you (or some imaginary friends, a tiny picture on your account worth cheating and risking quarantine</p><p>but will this tiny picture on your account have the same taste gain that way andgain in a fair way ? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"></p></cite><p>I respect your opinion but you are failing to have an open mind that in this specific scenario it is Not cheating because the mush who gets cured against his will or agrees passivly is mush and the only way for his current team to get a distinction the game offers is to sacrifice himself . If he tries to fight back as human afterwards its up to him amd e should , no one is arguing about that. But at the second he agrees to take one for his team he is 100% not cheating , he is mush and the only way to fool humans in eden that the ship is mush free is him getting cured (here i completely ignored the fact about getting vented when last human dies and instead used a logical RP reason).</p><p>I dont think you guys have had such extreme imagination before to consider this as Not breaking the rules. But common sense support that it is 100% ok to do it for the current team while still mush, its saving 14 fellow mush team mates from instant death. And again he can always fight back when cured to not break any rules of humans. There is no problem there.

The curing of the mush in this specific scenario when chun is only human left on board should be in my opinion allowed as long the cured mush guarantees to fight back as human but will stick to the games rules of never suiciding or surrendering all only in the case that chun is the last human alive. And seriously who will he leave the mush for? All humans are gone. He is not surrendering to humans because there is none left.<br>I hope i made a good case here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> i was skeptical half way there <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Well, carving every particular detailed case of what is "forbidden" in stone, with all the circumstanses taken in account, is clearly a pure crazyness. However, concidering everything that isn't outlined in such a detailed way as "allowed" (not forbidden) is a reverse side of the same coin. Holding weapons pre-mush isn't allowed regardless of the circumstances. However, the circumstances (like, being a newbie) might affect the way each particular detailed case is treated.

I’m seeing judges that apparently don’t fully understand the rules of Mush. I’m seeing general discussion that seems to encourage people to break the rules in some way or another. None of this is acceptable.</p><br><p><span class="tid_mod">Intentionally being converted or cured is quite simply playing against your team. There is no scenario ever where it’s acceptable. A human would never wish to be converted, period. A cured mush becomes human and must play for the human team - this includes attempting to thwart mush plans as well as no longer being willing to be converted. <br><br><br>In the same vein, keeping one human alive that knows they’re the only human puts them in a position where they may be knowingly breaking rules. There is such a thing as “Incitation to Spoiling” - this occurs when one player “forces” (either by lying, encouragement or other means) another to break the rules.<br><br><br>There’s also no reason for humans to almost kill themselves. That’s literally the same thing as suicide since you’re intentionally putting yourself in a position where you expect to be killed. </span></p><br><p><span class="tid_sideNote">This post carries the Peanutz Seal of Approval.

The curing of the mush in this specific scenario when chun is only human left on board should be in my opinion allowed as long the cured mush guarantees to fight back as human but will stick to the games rules of never suiciding or surrendering all only in the case that chun is the last human alive. And seriously who will he leave the mush for? All humans are gone. He is not surrendering to humans because there is none left.</cite><p>It is You, who do not understand. You can imagine, You can plan, but do it fair. Chun griefs? Bad thing, You can't do nothing to do it. Curing one of You just for going forward is CHEATING. Doing that with the will/without the will of that certain person is depriving them from their victory (because You force them to change team, with or without their approval.) and it is really disrespectful for all of those who did it fair way. Please, it is us, who respect and understand your opinion. It is You, who do not understand, that we know You fear and probably most of us share it, but if we want to achieve something, we want to do it fair way, not by doing unfair stuff because we are afraid of X.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil"><cite>I’m seeing judges try to find loopholes.</cite><br>NYAHAHAHAHA~~~~~<img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"></span></p>

There're very few cases where players are doing it with intention to harm - mostly they believe it's alright and they're not disrupting neutral play with weapon-holding, not playing against their team by killing crewmates purely based on "gut feelings" - they're trying to find the mush (etc etc). But it is spoiling the game, and not in a subjective way..</cite>But all of them are mentioned somewhere official - first post of Ask SDF, SDF Rules thread (which is awesome, by the way, it's not so long ago when we didn't have even that). I expect people to read those. If they don't, it's clearly their fault. And it gives players who are rules-aware reference point where to send those players who are not aware, when arguing why it is bad what they are doing.<br>But again, I don't expect random players to read every last thread in forums to find an official SDF position on their current situation. Or to create such threads just to wait few days for that kind of response. And I can't expect them to have totally same kind of reasoning behind what is and what isn't fair as SDF by default.</p><br><p><cite>&lt;&lt;The cheating problem isn't only about players of that particular ship, but all other players as well, and players that might end up on such a ship as the only person that doesn't agree with majority, who are willing to play a ship not as intended.</cite>The moment someone feels like a victim (and did everything in his power to stop something that victimizes them - that's very important in my eyes), makes cheating non-victimless, obviously, and changes the circumstances of the whole report. But I'm talking about situation, when all the players on board are alright with group's decision and report comes from someone who's already dead and just lurking around. I fail to see any victim there.</p>

                <p>Patches, <br>Well, to be fair, our little discussion has moved onto completely unrelated topic, compared to what this thread is about, plus, though I have a lot to add on the subject, most of it isn’t appropriate for this forum and basically has already been discussed before, so I’ll just keep it to myself, I guess.</p><br><p>If speaking to the point, all the possible ways have already been mentioned, I would’ve only added that getting a Mush Eden as a sneaky mushroom is easier than human-hostage Mush Eden, in my opinion. Gameplay-wise. Because keeping an inactive alive isn’t that easy of a task to handle due to not knowing their stats and due to ridiculous amount of panic attacks with a full crew being mush (the more mush are on board – the more panic attacks remaining humans are getting). In case of an active member being hold in captivity it’s pretty much the same, but on top of all the pain with keeping them alive you get a problem of holding them captive and ceasing their pestersome sabotage attempts. And due to being incapable of benefitting from eating plus being limited in benefitting from phagocyting - PVE part becomes a huge pain in the back. So this way has a significantly higher chance to fail on the PVE part than in case if human crew was doing all the job instead. In case of sneaky mush it's a serious challenge to make your crew believe you’re human and keep yourself away from everything that might outer your true nature without losing trust, but basically if you get it – you have to go through much less stress and can have more fun than in case of human hostage approach, when you’re being in stress of fail-fearing constantly.<br>That being said though – I’ve never had any of Eden infiltration wins and speaking more from a spectator’s viewpoint here. But well, what way to choose depends more on how the scenario evolves, than purely on player’s decision, I suppose.</p>

                <p>Changing team being an equivalent to surrender (or rather death of original character, as I see it, personally) might be clear to mods, judges and players who read forum and think about rules and concepts behind them. But is it really such an obvious way to think about it? If we made a poll between a big sample of players on random ships (not forums, because forum-goers aren't definitely the only players playing Mush), I wouldn't be surprise if statistically significant subset of them wouldn't see the connection or would argue about it, looking for situations when it is not the same thing for them.</p><p>And I think it would be nice to have some official place on forums where to direct those players when discussing such things ship-side to show them, what the official SDF stance on the matter is. If I end up in such discussion next year around this time, I'd rather tell them to look at post-it thread then to look for a random discussion from year ago somewhere on forums.</p>

Gameplay-wise. Because keeping an inactive alive isn’t that easy of a task to handle due to not knowing their stats and due to ridiculous amount of panic attacks with a full crew being mush (the more mush are on board – the more panic attacks remaining humans are getting). In case of an active member being hold in captivity it’s pretty much the same, but on top of all the pain with keeping them alive you get a problem of holding them captive and ceasing their pestersome sabotage attempts. And due to being incapable of benefitting from eating plus being limited in benefitting from phagocyting - PVE part becomes a huge pain in the back. So this way has a significantly higher chance to fail on the PVE part than in case if human crew was doing all the job instead. In case of sneaky mush it's a serious challenge to make your crew believe you’re human and keep yourself away from everything that might outer your true nature without losing trust, but basically if you get it – you have to go through much less stress and can have more fun than in case of human hostage approach, when you’re being in stress of fail-fearing constantly.<br>That being said though – I’ve never had any of Eden infiltration wins and speaking more from a spectator’s viewpoint here. But well, what way to choose depends more on how the scenario evolves, than purely on player’s decision, I suppose.</cite><p>also big thanks for this explanation , i was 100% not aware of all those complications. keeping few humans as ignorant pets seems to be less stressful than having an angry one who keeps scratching.<br>__________________________</p><p>Now i would like to ask one more thing related to the new options that were introduced above since all are helpful answering the mush infiltration strategies. (and i am asking here because the wiki is a bit limited for mush strategies)</p><ul><li>1- Are the mush allowed to sacrifice a mush mate as bait (with or against their will) to be killed at the cost of either turning a key human who is about to discover who the alpha mush or entire group of mush are , by leading the human into a trap where he comes to kill the mush we are using as bait and he may succeed in killing him, but in the process gets turned and with it we will lose a mush but eliminate the threat of getting detected And let the remaining humans know that one alpha mush is dead and there is only one more left?</li><li>2- or lets say we want to draw attention from the majority of suspect lists by turning 2 inactive humans , and using 2 anonymush and immediately framing them to be the 2 alpha mush and get the humans to kill them (and we also help killing those 2 mush with our own hands to not give the humans the chance to doubt us) and with it lead the humans to believe that they killed all mush and there are none left? in this case we will be betraying 2 newly recruited mush as a sacrifice but no one will bother us anymore to proceed in plans to infiltrate mush. is this ok? and if yes did i miss any complication (i clearly must have i think...)</li></ul>

If you're going to let time pass and hope to point humans that way, I'd suggest the same thing as above. Make it very clear what's going on in a private message or mush channel. If one of the inactives wakes up and assumes the mush role, though, the justification becomes much more difficult.</p><p>Big word of warning, though. Unless Eleesha is mush or dead, she will still have the ability to print the list until all mush are dead - both public and anonymous. If she's human and active, your anonymous status will be betrayed that way. (Assuming she hasn't already printed the list. If she has, then you're clear from this check.)</p>
