Representative Stephen Seagull<br><strong>Age</strong>: 47<br><strong>Nationality</strong>: Ambiguous (Certainly from Earth)<br><strong>Official Duty</strong>: Daedalus Ship Cook<br><strong>Actual Duties</strong>: Generalist, can specialise into anything that's required. He can be anything from a researcher, pilot to a Mush Hunter! Specialisation isn't always the way forward. Simply because you're say, a Bronze Chef Stephen doesn't mean you're useless. Later in the game, generalists become absolutely crucial to ship survival. With everybody else piloting, navigating and repairing; it'll be up to you to load fuel, extinguish fires and heal the crew. Generalists are the grease that keeps the gears grinding!<br><br><strong>[G]lory:</strong><br><br><em>Ambitious</em> - +4 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> first time a title is earned. (For example, if Jin Su and Gioele are inactive and you get commander, the title will trigger, but if Jin Su wakes up and becomes Commander again then dies, you won't get glory for being made commander the second time).<br><br><em>Extreme Chef</em> - +2 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> for every fight with an alien creature.

Don't expect to be cooking up dishes for the whole crew every day, but still a very useful skill. ONLY cook rations if you KNOW someone will eat them before Cycle 8.</p><p><strong><em>WARNING FOR NEWBIES</em></strong> - DO NOT COOK ALL THE RATIONS.

However, spores are destroyed when food is cooked or frozen.</p><p>Also note that until you're 'proven' Human, everybody will be very suspicious of you turning up offering unsolicited rations to them for this very reason.</p><br><p>2. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/mastered.png" alt=":mush_mastered:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Solid">Solid</a></strong> (5 XP) - "<em>I have more black-belts than you have shoes. I've been a mercenary in the seediest parts of the galaxy, and I've been a Miner for 5 years. You don't want an arm-wrestling contest, Roland.</em>"</p><p><strong>DISABLED WHEN MUSH</strong></p><p>Stephen has been beaten up and has kicked some ass. This underrated skill allows you to carry Heavy Objects (Some Artefacts, the Superfreezer and Ol' Faithful) unburdened, and adds +1 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> to your attacks. Raising the base damage from 1-3 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> to 2-4 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> damage. <br>It also gives you the ability to 'Kick 'em out!' which is a 2 AP action (1 AP against Inactive/Grand Inactive players) which will harmlessly move a character out of the room. You cannot control which exit you push the character through, though. Useful if some inactives at the bridge are siphoning Paola's Logistics AP gain.</p><p>This skill is <em>DISABLED</em> when Mush (likely due to an oversight) meaning that if you take this skill when Mush, Heavy objects will burden you, your hand to hand attacks will do the base 1-3 damage and you will not have the 'Kick them out!' ability. Keen-eyed Mush Hunters will notice and rule you human or mush based on this, so NEVER pick this skill when Mush unless you absolutely can't help it.</p><p>3. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Opportunist">Opportunist</a></strong> (50 XP) - "<em>I didn't get to where I am today by slouching.

Only activates once per title. 5 AP is pretty impressive, but in order to reap the full benefits of this skill, a grand total of 11 crew need to die. This skill only serves as an XP sink between Solid and Shooter.</p><p>This skill could be considered useful if you were Mush and were hoping to rampage and take out Jin Su, Gioele, Paola and Eleesha but Motion Twin saw you coming you dirty thug and disabled this skill when Mush.</p><p>4. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Shooter">Shooter</a></strong> (200 XP) "<em>Freelancing out there, you take every legal contract you can.

To make-up for his lack of formal education, Stephen has enough life experience and innate intuition to apprentice himself to any living crew member and learn one of their active skills. <br><strong>This skill is only usable once a voyage</strong> so choose carefully! Unless there is a blatant lack of skills in one area (Such as <a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Pilot">Pilot</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Technician">Technician</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Biologist">Biologist</a>) I strongly recommend you wait before picking a skill. You never know if Janice is Mush or if Andie/Finola are inactive! Pay Attention to the Magebook on the ship, and the ones that comms produce.</p><p>It's also worth noting that any skills that provide items (such as <a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Paranoid">Paranoid</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Green_Thumb">Green Thumb</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Robotics_Expert">Robotics Expert</a>) DO provide items. So it's entirely possible to use Stephen to gain additional hydropots, drones and cameras.</p><p>Also, as a final note, before you apprentice anything do familiarise yourself with what your intended skill will do if you apprentice it, and whether it stacks or not (for example, having two <a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Strateguru">Strategurus</a> doesn't reduce the amount of hunters that appear, but two <a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/logistics_expert">Logistics Experts</a> can stack AP onto one person. Theoretically.)</p><p>6. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ticket.png" alt=":mush_ticket_1:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Creative">Creative</a></strong> (600 XP) - "<em>Gravity Sim ain't too tough to fix. Seal the hole with some rebar up the back end, tape the lever down and apply power. I got the idea watching Chao question Ian.</em>"</p><p>Stephen's intellectual flexibility knows no bounds. Whether it's the awkward scrapes he's had to wriggle out of over the years, a hidden poetic side or his increasingly bizarre experimentation with his cooking, Stephen knows how to fix a problem. Be it a broken Navigations console, a horde of hunters or a rampaging mutant, Stephen can somehow nab a success out of a clear failure.</p><p>Whenever Stephen fails an action (barring comms signal establishment), he has a <em>50% chance</em> to regain 1 AP. This skill particularly shines during combat, piloting or repairs. Though 600XP is an absolute pain to acquire, it is absolutely worth it.<br>This works for sabotage as well, although whereas repairs, extinguishing, combat and hunter combat all cost 1 AP (barring injuries or <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/ian_soulton.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_IS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Ian</strong> sabotage costs 2AP. But hey, better 1AP returned than no AP returned.))</p><p>Total XP Investment: <em>1105 XP</em></p>

Once the Mush are gone, you can cook rations for starving crew members, and pull Gioele's coffee once per cycle for free!</p><p>Solid: In addition for its utilities in mush hunting, being able to carry the Superfreezer as well as kick inactives into storage can be very useful.</p><p>Shooter: Also helpful in the Mush Hunt, but if the Comms Officer unearths a Pilot Magebook, you'll be right in line to grab it. You'll also be useful on expeditions that lack a diplomat, granting you an edge in combat.</p><p>Apprentice: Able to replace any essential task, or bolster existing ones. A great skill for a Bronze player to take.</p><p><em>Opportunist</em>: Does you no favours, and is unlikely to trigger more than once. Taking this as Bronze essentially makes you skill-less.</p><p><em>Creative</em>: You'll be essentially skill-less again. The most you can hope for is a Technician or Pilot Magebook. Having an overall lower chance of success with everything means that sure, Creative will have more chance to trigger, but you shouldn't be HOPING for failures.</p><p><strong>[Si]lver:</strong></p><p>Good combinations!</p><p>Chef/Shooter: You'll have good cause to go on expeditions. Shoot the aliens, harvest their meat off-ship, once you get back, turn those hunks of meat into delicious, delicious protein slurry.</p><p>Creative/Shooter: Again, get a Pilot Magebook and you'll rival <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/roland.png" alt=":mush_roland_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Roland</strong> for Hunter kills. With just these two skills you should be able to man turrets fine, as well as taking out the Mush should they become a problem.</p><p>Apprentice/Creative: Usually when you take this pairing you're going Technician or Pilot. Stephen is the only one capable of being a creative Technician, and he can be extremely valuable late voyage when everything starts falling apart.</p><p>Chef/Solid: Haul the Freezer, Freeze the Meat, Haul the Meat, freeze the freez... no wait.</p><p><strong>[G]old:</strong></p><p>Good combinations!</p><p>Chef/Shooter/Solid/Opportunist - This is Stephen's level 4 loadout. You'll likely be welcome on expeditions due to your mastery of the Superfreezer, and your Shooter granting an extra point on expeditions unless that pesky diplomat <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/janice_kent.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JK:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Janice</strong> is lurking around. If the Mush reveal themselves/are sussed out, you'll have claim to the blaster which means you can do some serious harm to them. If the Blaster runs out, your unarmed attacks will cause serious damage without the knife.<br>If Jin Su and Gioele or Paola and Eleesha are incapacitated, the extra boost from Opportunist will give you a jump start when it comes to taking over their duties. Or avenging them.</p><p>If you're <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> Mush, drop Solid and Opportunist and pretend to be a Silver expedition focused chef.</p><p>Chef/Shooter/Solid/Apprentice - Apprentice gives you a wide variety of synergies with the other skills you have. Picking Survivalist or Botanist with Chef and Solid nets you a sure position on expedition teams.</p><p>Chef/???/Creative/Apprentice - Keeping Shooter or Solid unpicked can give you wiggle-room later on into the ship when you can decide whether solid or shooter would be more useful to your current ship. There are plenty of synergies between Creative and Apprentice that I can discuss (Caffeine Junkie, Chef, Technician Magebook, Creative. Fix everything all the time everywhere. Only recommend this with an inactive or Mush Gioele) but I won't get into all of them with this 'simple' guide.</p><p>Solid/Shooter/Creative/Apprentice/Chef Magebook - Have all your skills whilst sacrificing the ability to learn anything else from Magebooks. I absolutely recommend this set-up if other crew-members require the magebooks more than you, or the magebooks you got were utter rubbish (for example sprinter + radio expert). You realise the full, glorious potential of the humble cook.</p><p>Chef/Shooter/Apprentice/Creative - Recommended <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> Mush Loadout. No Solid to give you away, and creative ensures you can still put the hurt on, as well as returning half your AP if you fail at sabotage. Stephen also has excuses to roam around the ship and get dirty, and his apprentice skill allows you to insinuate yourself into most positions to get to where you want to be.</p><p>For the Human Side, good if you want Chef but still want to pick up a skill from mage-books.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote"><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong>: Even though I listed these combinations, I still recommend you WAIT. Not even just post-mush selection, but quite a fair amount into the voyage before filling up all four slots. Stephen's main advantage is his unparalleled flexibility, and locking yourself into one set of skills before the game's officially begin hampers you just slightly. Yet at the same time, don't be too shy about picking skills. If your ship is going on plenty of expeditions and getting plenty of meat, then absolutely get Chef. If your ship's short on active technicians or Andie's drooling in the Lab, get their skills and replace them!</span></p>

However, I can provide some commentary on Mush skills and how Stephen could possibly put them to use. However, remember when I suggest you wait, as Stephen, before picking your skills? That goes triple for Mush. Just because you're Chef, doesn't mean you should pick Fungal Kitchen. All of the Mush skills (barring Infector and Fertile) are highly situational, and you should only pick the skills that are useful to you <em>now</em>.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Fungal_Kitchen">Fungal Kitchen</a> - This skill only really works if the Humans are particular careless, or if you've somehow gained their trust because this is the one skill everybody expects a Mush Stephen to use. It's privacy rating is <em>invisible</em> meaning you can spore rations right infront of people, however it is triggered by MycoAlarms. Spore the Pills in the Medlab, Fruit in the Lab (provided you know Ian isn't going to re-plant or graft the fruit) or spore cooked rations ALREADY DESIGNATED for someone. It's not unusual for Raluca, with her lack of sleep to not want to waste valuable AP trekking to the refectory and back. Paola may also request a quick snack. There is no limit to the amount of spores a single consumable can hold. So if you get three spores going on a single consumable, that thing is an instant conversion in one delicious bite.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Hard_Boiled">Hard Boiled</a>/<a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Ninja">Ninja</a> mixed with Shooter/Creative/Wrestler means you can lay the hurt down right in public view and it won't be immediately obvious who's doing it. When you've cut their numbers down (I hope you grabbed Chun's Plastenite armour first!) you can survive their onslaught. <br>Of course, Rampaging in such a manner would be too easy, wouldn't it? Afterall, a mush conversion victory would be so much more satisfying... or should I say... so mush more satisfying.</p><p>Technician Creative Stephen will have strong reason for wandering around and getting dirty, allowing you to spore and trap with impunity.,</p><p>Taking traitor before Pheromodem with cristalite zones increases the possibility of not only you getting a free spore, but your fellow expeditionaries getting contaminated, too!</p><p>Stephen being a generalist, means he can also load fuel or relay PILGRED, also good excuses for getting dirty!<br>Cooking is also a good way to get dirty.</p><p>Note: I am very willing to have some actually competant mush give me advice or plans. Mush Stephen is by far my weakest subject.</p>

There is no right or wrong way to play Stephen, but if you're interested, I'm going to lay out his relationships with the other characters and his personality as far as I can glean from the Mush canon.</p><p>Do note: Make it clear to others that you're roleplaying. Do not use roleplay as an excuse to act purposely against the ship. (For example, do not shoot Gioele because Stephen and Gioele have a history). Stephen can be a surly character, and unless it's clear you're roleplaying, some people may take offence.</p><p>This interpretation as well as the description of relationships I provide are not hard and fast rules for how to roleplay him. It's mostly just the product of my obsessive mind, but I hope you get some mileage out of them!</p><p><strong>Stephen's Personality</strong></p><p>I'm not going to tell you how to roleplay Stephen to every detail (at least that's not my intention but hey I may just get carried away) but I will lay out his main traits and explain how they could possibly manifest.<br>My sources will be from the Biography's (both experience tab and mush help) and 'My Settings' quotes (because some are quite illuminating).</p><p>Ambitious - Though Stephen is quite sure of himself in some respects, he craves recognition and loves to fuel his own reputation. As soon as he defrosted he proclaimed himself 'Head Chef' (as opposed to only chef) of the Daedalus. He won't go cleaving his way through his obviously human superiors, but he may watch them more closely for Mush behaviour than normal. <br>He may create titles that previously didn't exist and assign them to himself. He strongly resents looking foolish or incompetent, and as a result may avoid making foolish brags or stunts.</p><p>Although make no mistake, he will exploit whatever reputation, titles or perks he has to full effect. Though after he was caught embezzling all those years ago, he may be a little more careful about it nowadays...</p>

                <p>Experienced Badass - Stephen is no stranger to conflict, and fears little. He's been a Soldier in the SDF, a convict, a slave and</p><p>a galactic mercenary. He's dodged Prison, car bombings, wars and train delays to get here.<br>Stephen has multiple black belts, and people are still telling the story of that guy who disrespected Stephen and ended up pulled</p><p>into several pieces and cooked each piece into a different meal (of course, that could just be a story).<br>Nevertheless, there's no question Stephen's lived and learned a lot about conflict, prison life, boxylium, bombs, warfare and</p><p>hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>However, a harsh life is unlikely to contribute to a sunny disposition. Stephen will likely be a grumpy, solitary sort. Any sense</p><p>of humour he may have will probably be extremely dry and dark.</p><p>Culinary Artist - Stephen got into cooking as a Trooper in the SDF. His stint in the military didn't last long, but food</p><p>preparation got into his skin in a big way. Travelling throughout the galaxy, he picked up stranger and stranger recipes,</p><p>preparing anything and everything from rock stew and mushroom pie to the strangest alien dishes you've ever seen.</p><p>On-board the Daedalus, with even fewer supplies and resources except these boxes of protein-enriched molasses generously named</p><p>'rations' Stephen will no doubt try to 'spice them up'. Stephen's big on substance but not so big on presentation. He'll tell you</p><p>it's delicious, and he may be right. But... did the broth just burp at you?</p><p>Creative - Stephen's incredibly wide-ranging life and massive well of experience has left him with the ability to make leaps of</p><p>logic and connections that others don't see. If Stephen were a Detective, he'd be the asshat who stands up in the middle of a</p><p>conversation about your Auntie and say 'THAT'S IT I KNOW HOW DR. BLACK WAS KILLED' and storm out. Yeah, that kinda guy.</p><p>He applies his creative nature in combat, as well as finding inventive solutions to problems he might not necessarily be trained</p><p>in. <br>It's also entirely possible that Stephen may have a romantic side. Who knows? If you want to play him writing secret poetry, go</p><p>right ahead.<br>It is most likely though that he applies his creativity to his cooking.</p><p>Leader - Though he doesn't come close to the natural leadership of Kim Jin Su, Stephen has plenty of experience leading and</p><p>commanding, as well as managing a small ship of clashing personalities under stressful situations. Stephen feels comfortable in a</p><p>position of leadership, and seeks it out because he loves the respect and perks it offers him.</p><p>Nationality - Stephen's nationality is ambiguous and it's entirely possible that after decades of roaming around space that his</p><p>cultural identity is lost to him. However, he is almost certainly a spanish speaker due to his extensive exposure to mexican</p><p>culture, and it could possibly be his home country.</p>

                <p><strong>Stephen's Relationships</strong> - If you happen across a fellow roleplayer, or jump with friends, these can provide some material to kick-start some roleplay!</p><p>Andie Graham - No real factual evidence here as Andie and Stephen have no history, and not much in common. Andie may try being a friend and digging into Stephen's stoic facade, alternatively Stephen may provide a reluctant shoulder to cry on should Andie feel hurt.</p><p>Derek Hogan - Derek's an obnoxious windbag. Sure, Stephen doesn't have a history with Derek, but somehow I can't see the two getting along.</p><p>Eleesha Williams - Both studied in Mexico. Eleesha succeeded in her studies at Computer Studies, Stephen flunked his unidentified courses (they would not have met, Eleesha took her studies a full 16 years after Stephen dropped out, and it's not 100% clear if Stephen even studied in mexico!). It's unlikely they met, but they can bond over a shared location. In addition, Eleesha never completed her report into the Boxylium mines, which Stephen experienced first-hand; so Eleesha may be quite curious. Stephen may or may not welcome the nosy journalist poking her nose into his private life.</p><p>Finola Keegan - Both suffered in the Boxylium Mines. Finola as underpaid, under-equipped staff, and Stephen as a beleaguered, enslaved Miner. Both likely quite unhappy with Gioele.</p><p>Frieda Bergmann - Stephen and Frieda have no history, or anything in common. Maybe Frieda, land-bound for the majority of her career (barring her adventure on the Gonzak) may be fascinated to hear Stephen's tales of far-off planets and space ports.</p><p>Gioele Rinaldo - This guy. This fucking guy. Gioele had Stephen imprisoned for corrupting a minor, simply for providing transport. On top of THAT, it was a Rinaldo corp. Prison Mine he was sent to. For three whole years, Stephen slaved making this asshat's wallet thicker. Fuck Gioele. Fuck this guy. Now he's trapped on the same ship as this fatcat.</p><p>Ian Soulton - Ian's a nice guy. May or may not try to socialise with Stephen. They may bond over shared vegan recipes, who knows. <br>Stephen does like a good mushroom tart, and Ian knows all about mushrooms. Dude.</p><p>Janice Kent - No real history or common ground, although Janice is a shrink so she may investigate Stephen's well-being and try to delve into his past. Stephen meanwhile, may well have his eyes on her NERON Admin title!</p><p>Jiang Hua - If there's a thing that's ever crawled, slithered, walked, swam or flown on a planet's surface, Hua's seen, documented and skinned it. Stephen will definitely want to pick her brain for exotic new meats and recipes.</p><p>Kim Jin Su - Some big-shot celebrity. Though they have no history, Stephen will definitely be envious of Jin Su's commander title.</p><p>Lai Kuan-Ti - Some dandy fop who thinks himself a leader of men. Whereas Kuan-Ti got his notions of leadership from comic books,</p><p>movies and video games, Stephen has actually led a team in the worst parts of the galaxy AND been a politician. Kuan-Ti will probably come off as a bit naive to Stephen.</p><p>Paola Rinaldo - Stephen gave a 15 year old Paola a ride to Mars and was imprisoned for it by her Father. Stephen may blame her, or not. It's quite likely that Paola was the one that stopped the nervy, twitchy crew of the Daedalus from executing Stephen on the spot when the stowaway revealed himself when everybody defrosted. Stephen may end up fighting with Gioele for Paola's affections, and Paola may see the impoverished, self-reliant, grounded Stephen as the father figure Gioele isn't.</p><p>Raluca Tomescu - Some creepy chick in the back. Doesn't ask Stephen weird questions, tell him what to do or ask him how he's 'feeling'. There are worse people on this ship.</p><p>Roland Zuccali - Annoying in a special kind of way. Tells bad jokes, makes obnoxious pranks. Stephen's the kind of humourless, violent man that jokesters like Roland can't help but antagonise. The Chef is the best straight man any budding comedian could hope for!</p><p>Terrence Archer - No history or common ground. Terrence is also kind of a bitter downer, too.</p><p>Wang Chao - Stephen has worked with and for people like Chao and that is precisely why he knows to keep out of this psychopath's way. Stephen doesn't take any shit, but he's not looking for trouble either. In fact, Chao might be the only guy who can screw with Stephen and get away with it; being second in command and Jin-Su's right hand man. On-top of being a legitimately scary guy,</p><p>Chao being 'head of security' and co-mush hunter and Stephen's precarious position as <span class="tid_strike">stowaway</span> 'honourary crew' means he may hesitate before retaliating.</p><p>Yeah, Wang's a jerk.</p><p>Zhong Chun - No history. They may share their experiences with being in the public eye (Stephen being a senator mired in a muddy corruption scandal and Chun being broadcast to the entire universe that she's the Mush's bane) but other than that, they have little in common.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">This is my guide to Stephen Seagull, written all in one go over several hours.

If you want to contact me, I hang around at #Mush-En on the Mibbit IRC.<br><br>In all, I hope this guide of mine will help anybody curious about my absolute favourite character, and I hope it encourages you to dump some exp into him, or have some fun roleplaying as him. Or, at the very least, increase the amount of Rolands victimising Stephens with their pranks.<br><br>I would like to emphasise once again that roleplay is NOT an excuse to grief the ship. Yes, Stephen loathes Gioele, but that's not an excuse to kill him at the slightest provocation, or to kill everybody because 'Stephen's a crazy badass'.</span></p>

                <p>Apologies for the extremely strange formatting in between 'Stephen's relationships' and 'Roleplay'. I had that part of the guide stored on notepad, which butchered the formatting. Because I posted afterwards, I can't edit it. So you'll have to live with the weirdness, unless a moderator takes pity!</p>

                <p>Seems pretty good so far, especially the roleplay section despite the formatting (I did <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/tid/forum#!view/104909?p=4|thread/38932691?p=1">something similar</a> for the whole crew and their relations).</p><p>Unfortunately with multiple posts I don't think you'll be able to edit things, I see a couple of corrections are needed:<br>-You seemed to imply it in the Glory section, but Andie is #3 for Comms Officer with Stephen at #4 behind her.<br>-Although the "Consume", "Express Cook" and "Coffee!" action bars all have a Chef point symbol next to them, they do not use them and are free for non-Chefs anyway (unless they have Gastro or something else that adds AP cost).<br>-When Fungal Kitchen is used to put spores onto rations, they are not destroyed by freezing, only by cooking. You would have to freeze and re-cook a Cooked ration to be sure it is clean (or simply have Chun eat it).<br>-The Microwave is commonly moved to Rear Corridor to cook Rations when Comms is finished/down, and should be in the list of Heavy items (as it will be on every ship).</p><p>Pedantry from me:<br>-With a Tech Mage Book, Roland can be a Creative Technician as well.<br>-Traitor increases the chance of a Mush Trap event, but the 50% (or whatever) of each person getting a spore (including Mush) remains the same.<br>-If Mushovore Bacteria is researched, you will need four spores on a consumable to convert someone from clean.</p><p>Maybe a Mod can help out with this, otherwise people can just check the whole thread.

Once I had this ship and <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/paola.png" alt=":mush_paola_50:" class="tid_ico">, altrough considered this skill for her as useless because she must have focused on comms, but I convinced her and managed to be a biologist.
