                <p>Hm... what if mushes would just share their usernames (when they feel like it and agree to it) and then communicate via twin pm with themselves? I wonder whether that is allowed... no human might conclude from their online time anymore that they are speaking with each other while pretending to be inactive.. or that someone has no free tab open and is therefore slightly suspicious... I dunno whether that's intended though...if you take care that no pheromoedem is finished, it is probably not even necessary to use a private chat-tab. well, that vwoudl be meta-gaming against meta-gaming I guess <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I'm even freer in opinion about what's allowed than TA is; I personally think most off-game communication during a game doesn't add too much, though I have experimented with it, both in INTENSIVE mush hunting with an experienced player in one of my early ships, learning how spreadsheeting was done (and much about the game, including that even pros may not know all the factors, "I think you must be a mush, M'dear" hahahahahaha <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqTQYGUhz_Y)" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqTQY...</a> as well as some prolonged social fun after my death with those still alive and striving to get a win for their team, which may or may not have been my team to begin with. That's occasionally been <em>great</em> fun, especially when I was mush, there may have been other mush, and the humans may or may not be able to win. The headgames possible when both of us know the game well, respect the rules, and dance around what ifs and what is.... Very very fun for us!</p><p>I rarely purposefully attempt to jump with people, though I have cooperated with others doing so, rarely. I perceive a value in true random jumping - which doesn't prevent me from ending up on ships with <em>others I recognize, or who have recognized me, from having played with before and/or spoken with extensively in the forums, PM, or whatever.</em> It's great. I speak and play fairly distinctively and I'm glad to jump with all of you - even those of you who apparently hate me and delight in giving me a hard time, or worse - I just hope the ships I share with <strong>you</strong> hostile fellows happen to be filled with many others who are very reasonable. And know that if you step out of line with passive or active negativity, I am reporting you with savage glee... so play as you choose, and earn the 'fun' you take.... if it's legal it's free but stay in those lines).</p><p>As to the rules, I focus on what we can enforce, and what the rules say. As I read the rules, we currently have no rule that says 'Communicating off game in a way which cannot be done on game is forbidden'. As I read the rules, the only thing that talks about off game communications is in the Twinoid Terms and Conditions stuff, <a href="http://twinoid.com/support/cgu" target="_blank">http://twinoid.com/support/cgu</a> and there's not that much there that applies to this, just making it clear that doing illegal stuff in connection to Twinoid is likely to get you in trouble.</p><p>People who group jump on a public ship and are using IRC together, maybe half of them are from the group and half are randoms... Ehh it doesn't appeal to me, I see lots of problems possible in it - but it's not within the rules I'm here to help enforce either way. If you get a torn tongue and you even post on the forums, "I am Jin on a D2C3 ship and our mush just rampaged, Hua killed Paola and I think she transferred into Derek, my tongue is torn and I have a hemorrhage, I need help now and I can't communicate, talk to me here and help me there!" ....</p><p>I'm probably going to laugh and enjoy watching everyone's reactions, I might even offer some advice, but I'm not going to delete that thread or anything. If you search through the threads you'll find that others have made similar posts, and arguably worse ones - we joke about people who ask overly specific newbie mush questions getting that character killed on many ships across the games currently being played, and of course.... that's more than a joke.</p><p>Now we get to where rulebreaking could occur. A newbie mush Paola asks on the forum about their circumstances, and gets recognized on their ship, and killed.</p><p>Ooh. Why was that player killed? Was Paola a random kill? If someone reports her kill for bad reasons or none (It's not OK to randomly kill someone even if you happen to be right, they were a mush.... the problem is your reasoning if it's a random kill), judges are going to look at the evidence of that ship's logs. If your evidence is off ship.... you're going to look like a random killer, whoops. You're going to be earning yourself a sanction.... So whatever you do, communicate. Evaluate. Leave an evidence trail on ship that helps us understand in case we get called upon to judge your play.</p><p>Those are extremes, and.... if it needs to be said, these are my thoughts, not some strong and stern SDF unified stance. There's currently no rules about off game interactions in general (some specific interactions are forbidden by Terms). If we end up needing some new rules, I guess we get them someday.</p><p>About 'proving' yourself mush or human through off game means, be it a screenshot or whatever....</p><p>I don't believe it when I see it done. Remember to be careful about the links you are offered, make sure it's a legit site you're going to.... that unusual screenshot link could be something to try and mess you up. Even if it's legit, it can be faked. Many of us have photo editing skills; if I wanted to I could catch screenshots aplenty from my various games, enough to stitch together a really real looking faked screenshot from any current ship, making my view look like that of a mush or a human - and I don't even have any special imagine handling programs or formal training, just had a hobby for a few months of making my own photo cartoons. I dare bet I could put together two 'identical' screenshots, from the same moment of a ship, one showing me as a human, the other showing me as a mush, and that at least half the people who pick between them would fail to identify the true image - half being true random, can't tell which is real <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>So I'm not too excited about off game proof either. It doesn't do much to convince me.</p>

                <p>I'll add that using external communication to get around Torn Tongue, a similar injury, or the loss of their WT/iTrakie was ruled to be <strong>highly</strong> discouraged early on by the SDF. It just hasn't come up much in recent months, but the ruling definitely exists. That definitely counts as using outside communication to circumvent the in game systems. Injuries are less of an excuse in particular this season, given that <em>most</em> ships will have access to a Medic.</p><p>One of the reasons we encourage the use of on-ship communication is due to the nature of reports, if one is filed. If your Mush hunt channel only exists on IRC, for example, and the reasons for killing someone aren't discussed <em>somewhere</em> in the ship's logs, it could be reasoned that you may not have had enough evidence to make that kill. Since we can only reasonably review the communication and actions logged by the game, anything you want filed as "evidence" in your favor (in case you are reported) better be found in those logs.</p><p>I've left logs for the judges in a PM to myself, whenever I'm about to do something that could be potentially considered playing against the team. On a recent ship, I was Mush, and I killed my partner in order to keep my cover. He'd dropped his WT and spored literally minutes after selection, and was caught. I didn't even have the chance to PM him to work out a strategy, and I rarely ever use the Mush channel. I knew I <em>might</em> get reported for being the one to kill him, so around the time I attacked him, I left a PM with my motive for doing so...just in case. The Mush team won in the end, even though I didn't live to see it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

I dare bet I could put together two 'identical' screenshots, from the same moment of a ship, one showing me as a human, the other showing me as a mush, and that at least half the people who pick between them would fail to identify the true image - half being true random, can't tell which is real <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">.</cite><p>If you can read source code, you can have a lot of fun with Firebug to create a realistic-looking fake screenshot and you would only need to take one picture.</p>
