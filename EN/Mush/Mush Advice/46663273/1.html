                <p>I'm not the most experienced Chun ever, but I'm very active and I think a lot. I have a situation on my ship. We had a Finola who was verified human by xyloph, but was mostly inactive and kept forgetting to put the apron down. Finally on day 5 we had to murder her even though we knew she was human just to get the apron back. I also had a very mushy Eleesha (who we had to kill as well and turned out human) who chose IT expert and Technican. We have a Chao who chose Wrester and shooter.</p><p>So I have no crewmates with skills specific to the mush hunt. I also have little evidence of any mushy activity at all, 2 'highly inactives' and 1 inactive.</p><p>Well, now the mush have had 3 days to laugh it up and spore away, but we've finally got AG and CS. Now prevailing wisdom is MA before MS.</p><p>But I am trying to get the crew to agree that MA may be the wrong move this time, because:<br>1. The mush may have already done all their mushiness, and may have four spores each and are biding their time to strike.<br>2. They could be among the inactives.<br>3. We have to get lucky with MA placement</p><p>So MA may net us NO intelligence at all for a chun already handicapped by lack of Torturer or Tracker.</p><p>Whereas MS will let us know some things for sure.</p><p>Am I right that this situation 'changes the rules' and we should do MS first? OR should I follow the normal advice and do MA first?</p>

                <p>wasn't aware that there was a consensus on research order, other than "antispore/constipaspore first"</p><p>personally i would prefer MS over MA. <br>sure, MA help in finding out that someone got spored, but you may already have spores on you and only MS gives you a <strong>guarantee</strong> that you are actually spore free.</p><p>if someone already has 2 spores on them, then MycoAlarms won't stop them from getting turned. <br>when you check yourself with MycoScan and notice you already got 1-2 spores, then you can do <br>counter-measures and avoid going into rooms that could be trapped. or if you have a way of removing spores (Mushicide Soap , Spore Sucker, Mycologist Ian)<br>then you can prevent conversion by removing all your spores.</p><p>also if you are a active Chun, i think you should finish MS fast, because once that project is done, you don't have to stay in lab all the time and can move around, trying to disarm traps.<br>(only 5 projects require your presence, 2 of them are useless most of the time - Mushicide Soap [you usually don't want to waste the soap] and Mush Hunter ZC [only gives glory]. 2 of them are irrelevant early game, because they require a dead mush. - Mushovore Bacteria and RFS)</p><p>i am actually Chun myself currently. but research is progressing a bit slow here :/</p><br><p>[I think people are just used to researching MA first, because Chun is inactive newbie in most ships, so she will be starving and MS won't be available until Ghost Chun Xyloph entry is decoded]</p>

                <p><strong>MycoScan</strong> will be avoided by most of experienced mushes, unless you have super-active ship where every move is watched, and every missing ap is noticed and they have only some few traps. If they want to convert humans, they will focus on turning one human after another, and everyone will very likely see 0 on scan. Or they even convert just one human, take anonymush and wait for any victory as you have no tools to check that anymore. Scan is good thing to narrow possiable mush tactics, preventing traps in bays/corridors/etc, after all more direct ways became impossiable.</p><p><strong>MycoAlarms</strong> can be used in two ways:<br>1) Just secure more rooms, using them as cameras in Icarus, Med, Lab, Nexus, etc<br>2) To make traps for mushes, hiding them in rooms, where traps can happen, or to hide somewhere and ask a human to work as a bait for spiking<br>In situation like yours - second way can be very useful, if mushes get caught by such alarm. For the first way it's probably too late, but still not having 2 mushes coming to Icarus, making trap + 2 spiking another player is really nice.<br>Still, if mushes are not greedy and already have converted enough for victory, alarms will be useless.</p><p>But research don't win games, it just make mush progress slower/more risky. Is up to you, to locate them.</p><p>If you have idles in unprotected rooms, better to kill (trade only if offer is already here, don't wait for it) them very long ago. <br>- It will make sure there is no anonymush hiding behind them.<br>- If any of them is already converted or alpha mushes, you can go for pheromodem/bacteria, that are much more useful<br>- Also those people with 12ap/12mp are too great to transfer to rampage and kill every important human left. Especially if those characters can take skills like Diplomat/Shooter/Apprentice/Wrestler.</p>

                <p>well, I was Roland in the game before and I got converted mush when examining a patrol ship. <br>I was treated as confirmed, because I had been sick. Eleesha already had printed the list - so I immediately picked Anonymush after hitting the trap. I just wanted to get to Sol/Eden so I played human - nobody even had a chance to find out I was mush. (only evil thing I did was sabotaging the oxy tank when oxygen was already low. but nobody noticed it.)</p><p>with MycoAlarms in the Bay...well the Alarm would have went off and maybe had exposed my Alpha Mush....but I would still have been converted to Beta Mush.</p><p>with Mycoscanners I could have checked myself and see that I already had 2 spores and it may have been possible for humans to save me.</p>

                <p>MycoAlarms are important if you're going on expos with mush still alive, because Icarus Bay is a great place for spiking. A mush Hua especially can extract spores in Rear Corridor on her way to the bay, spike her target and immediately launch so that she can blame her dirtiness on the expo. You could also move cameras, but it's just another thing to coordinate (and another free dirty excuse unless the mover is recently confirmed or Chun). And they are extra important if you don't have extra cameras from Gioele, because that means two of three important non-dorm rooms (Lab, Bridge, Nexus) are going to be open for trapping or direct spiking.</p><p>The scanner can sometimes be useful for determining what sort of game your mush are playing, but IMO should either be researched early enough that the mush are unlikely to have already converted anyone, or after the alarms.</p>
