                <p>In a game of Mush my <em>Janice</em>, an initially hopeful goody two-shoes, gradually turned more bitter and desperate as the game progressed, more horrible things happened and the situation went to hell. After having to kill <em>Gioele</em> in front of his daughter, watching comrades fall and be unmasked as the <em>Mush</em>, and carrying the psychological burdens of the entire crew as the <em>Shrink</em>, I found that a fitting "last straw breaking the camel's back" scenario occurred when her closest partner, after sending her a dramatic, emotional letter apologizing and wishing her the best, unexpectedly turned into a <em>Berserker</em> and was put down by the other crewmembers.</p><p><strong>My question is this</strong>: since after that event I have roleplayed <em>Janice</em> as permanently scarred, jumpy and slighty insane, would this kind of situation <em>justify actions that don't make gameplay sense</em>, binge eating rations, punching someone who keeps doubting her etc? Obviously they can't be Mush, but in that situation the character could very well react more extremely.</p><p>Is this kind of thing a reportable offense, or permitted? I'm not sure where the roleplay liberties end and the Human vs Mush gameplay rules begin...</p>

                <p>My answer, as someone who might have to play beside you someday - the line is 'where it matters'.</p><p>Does your ship have tons of rations and everything going smoothly, expos flowing so you guys have food up to your ears? Then pig out in the name of RP all you want - you are not playing against your team to do so because it's not going to do any harm. If you guys don't 'have more food than you can eat' and it's looking like you won't anytime soon, have your 'pigging out' be virtual food only, not coded food. Write up a few awesome RP posts about your character running to the refractory and struggling to scrape the last few bits of gravy off the side of someone's discarded carton. Of stalking someone going to eat, of your emotions and turmoil and behavior as you agonize while watching them, your frazzled self control barely held in check as you think about how soon there won't be any more food to eat and how you cannot stand it. Note that you don't even have to actually move to do this - and shouldn't. Let it be virtual movement as well. Save your coded resources for playing with your coded team.</p><p>That punch you want your character to throw can be virtual too. In my opinion, hostility rarely makes the playing enviromnent more pleasant overall - use it in tiny doses and assume that it's a Very Strong Spice, with just a hint flavoring the entire experience a great deal, and more than the smallest amount often Ruining The Dish.</p><p>On my current ship, I was 14th aboard and got Racula. I started heavily with RP, then dropped it entirely. The ship's full of pretty new players for the most part - we had one seemingly experienced guy and a griefer wasted supplies and ensured that player's death (possibly accidentally, but the griefing was real enough and laced with enough racial and sexual profanity to make it clear this was going way beyond the limits of appropriate play even for a Mush (the griefer was human).</p><p>But I had to drop my RP because I was confusing my fellow players, and they were already desperately confused. A ship on D2 with only 1 camera installed - and that one not in either dorm? No dirty thread? No research or project threads?</p><p>I tentatively tried to change my RP, to post 'putting up notes' for people to follow - but that wasn't blunt enough either and people were still highly confused - they can't all be mush, it's barely D3 now. Impossible they are -all- mush, though they're playing so newbie that unless the mush are that new, I may indeed log in one day to find myself Last Human, sheesh.</p><p>Point being though - it was appropriate and reasonable for me on this ship to drop my RP entirely. Throw it away, because it wasn't what the ship needed. Remember, we are forbidden to 'play against the team' - or to 'surrender', and surrendering to your urge to knowingly be 'bad' as a human is indeed surrender and playing against your team - if you use coded resources for it. If you keep it to words only, and if you are not confusing the heck out of everyone around you in ways that are getting the others to waste resources or get a bad feel from the hostility - then it's awesome, do it more!</p>

                <p>Great post from Impet. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Only thing I'd add to it is that one doesn't need to be 100% RP or 100% out of character. If it's confusing people, there are ways to avoid that without giving it up entirely. In the past I've been known to make specific RP threads when playing characters/ships on which I didn't want to RP all the time. You could also make a private message group with anyone else interested in RP and keep it to that.</p>

The bit above is important.</p><p>Does punching people and eating rations in a gluttonous manner help your team? I would say surely not. This isn't a game where it's a free for all and RP is utmost. Utmost is working with your team not against it. RP to me or for Mush anyway, is in how you speak not how you play. And, within this guideline, there should also be care taken that the rules are followed as to how you speak to people. Keep it entertaining, if your RP is berating and insults, that's not gonna fly.</p>

                <p>There's not really a lot of roleplay liberties. Most people are here for the game first, and don't appreciate roleplay. Many even get annoyed with excessive chatter. I keep my roleplays limited to derailing unimportant topics. A lot of the hardcore players don't quite appreciate roleplaying either... and that's when it's harmless. TV shows are full of drama with crazy characters, but sadly, Mush can't go that far with good players.</p><p>Also note that a lot of people on games like this (casual, on 5 minutes a day) have poor OOC/IC separation. They'll consider your actions as actions by the player, not the character.</p><p>I'd like to see a roleplay ship or one with less.. "family friendly" restrictions, but I doubt that'll happen soon.</p>

She then assassinates Chun to get the hacker kit, and flies the ship back to Sol.</cite><p>Heh, whenever I play Finola I wake up first confused, asking what's going on, then screaming at Kuan Ti about my kidnapping.

Write whatever story you want, I like to write happy ones... for characters I like anyways. ^^ <br>It's just that almost every time Hua is brought up, the only focus is on her weight, or that she doesn't look feminine enough, not any of the other elements of the character. People who seem to care about character are bypassing a character as dynamic as any other because.... she's fat?</p>

                <p>the OTT flirting does get old fast though, it's like being on a ship with a 13yr old who is thinking a lot about adult activities while doing none of them IRL. plus there is a good chance those females are actually males. RP is fine but flirting because you're immature is lame IMO</p><p>(not sure if that applies to you though ZaphodBeeblbrox, I am really just generalising)</p>
