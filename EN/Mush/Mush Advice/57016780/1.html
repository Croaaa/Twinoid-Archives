So if I join as Eleesha on D3, that's when the thing starts. So if I woke up on D3C1 and picked Tracker, It would take until around D10C1 for THE List to drop to 1 person.

                <p>what is "forced selection"?</p><p>thanks for the answers. especially about eleesha. this means wiki is wrong. someone should change that infos about tracker in wiki...</p><p>just few more questions :<br>who is the current Admin for english server? last i heard buzzard is no longer an active admin for MT. who replaced him? none?</p><p><cite>new admin will just make his possible to keep the game running but can't afford spending time (and so money) on updating an unprofitable game like mush</cite><br>As far i know Die2nite makes way less money for MT than mush , and creators of D2N also left , yet the current devs did notice the low number of player base and adapted to it by reducing number of towns from 3 to 1. i dont see any money lose or even effort or time lose if the devs in mush did/do the same in next update/season (i assume EN mush get any update FR mush gets every season, so reducing number of ships is just 60 minutes work on the day they transfer the updates to EN mush server). <br>from my experience in d2n the Devs need the majority of the community to address the problem to them officially and make it clear to them that it is a problem which needs fixing. if no one complains and some put the cause of the problem on other reasons than low player base numbers , then the Devs wont move a muscle in next update even though they could.</p><p>i read that old thread Darjus posted and all i see is the majority are asking for the obvious solution as well 7 months ago....</p><p><cite>not even sure it can solve the problem, if player wait for Roland, no mater if there's 10, 6 or 2 ships filling, he won't join </cite><br>that is a different issue if individual players wait to avoid picking specific characters, it has nothing to do with slowly filling ships of all 16 characters. it has only to do with the low player base numbers in random ships in mush. i am only addressing the problem that currently it takes 3 to 4 days to have 13 from 16 players fill a ship. so regardless if some are avoiding certain characters, it took entire 72 to 96 hours for 13 players to pick 13 favorite "not hated" characters. that is still too long and can be solved Easily. the mush selection too place just 4 cycles after we had 13 players join, the problem is filling the ship in 96 hours , not waiting for last 2 characters to join for 3 days. <br>the long wait is clearly and mainly because too many ships are offered. if the number of open ships is divided in half then those 13 players will 100% join their ship in half that time which is just day 48 hours. after that if the ship stays without last 3 unwanted characters then that is another different problem no one is addressing because its a feature of random ships.</p><p>i think being flexible with the long wait isnt healthy or helpful, the community should demand a solution to reduce the wait because the devs are open to it from experience in other games.</p>

                <p><cite>In english community it seems we have noone who is deep in touch with admins and is submitting the community's wishes and suggestions. Or if we have, they are too busy with other stuff.</cite> <strong>That</strong> was assuming wrong things. And it is extremely discouraging (for mods as well as for devs, who get the same kind of remarks) to have people assume that nothing is done when it's not true, especially from people who do know that there is a contact between the devs and players. Maybe it's not enough, but "not enough" doesn't mean nothing.</p><p>And it's the same for the current situation of the game. MT can't do enough to satisfy players, but it doesn't mean that they do nothing at all and that they don't care. In facts we are lucky that they don't give up completely after being accused permanently of doing nothing, even on games that are still updated. That was a <strong>general</strong> remark, not a personal one. Just because the glass is not full doesn't mean that it is completely empty.</p>

Major bugs can still be fixed, but that's it. The dev currently in charge of Mush was asked about reducing the number of ships, but the code is too complicated and changing that setting might cause too many problems.<br></cite></p><p><cite>They do care [devs]. The main dev did care about suggestions and reports from both communities, when he was still there. But he left, and now it is too difficult and too expensive to make updates or changes. MT still cares enough to maintain games even when it makes them lose money, to enable season changes, and to keep devs for old games in case there are problems.</cite></p><p>Isn't it enough?

List starts dropping names starting from first person to join the ship.</p><p>Jump792: first as mentioned above. They maybe can change the code but they wont be able to fix the errors and bugs afterwards if any are present. <br>And its called setting prioriries. For MT there are higher priorities when ir comes to support already working games. They only deal with costumers concerns when the time for it is urgent and that is always when either the seasonal changes are needed every 6 months or so.. or when they face mass complaints that could cost them big lose of money.</p><p>Sadly the current siruation is neither so this server must wait for a solution in next season and hope MT has mush back on top of priority list.</p>

                <p>Motion Twin is not a big society with the means to hire "lackeys" or to have lots of devs working on the same project. Blackmagic was not entirely alone, other devs helped him create the game, especially during the first phases of its creation. They both helped with the developing and graphics, and with the balancing of the game as several of them played on random ships.</p><p>But most of the work was done by Blackmagic, and he's the one who carried on developing, solving problems and balancing the game. That represented a lot of work, and MT definitely didn't have the means to have several people working on that (actually, they didn't have the means to have BM work only on Mush, he had to work on other games as well).</p>

                <p>Motion Twin has always had the same organization. They have no employees or employers, all devs have equal shares in the society, equal salaries, and equal weight in discussions. Some of them have been here from the beginning, like Deepnight, who created Hordes and Die2Nite, or Skool. Others stayed for a while and then left, because they wanted to work differently, because they wanted to be independent, because they wanted a change... And others joined the team (and have either left or stayed). There's been a regular turnover since the society was created (I think it was 10 years ago, but I'm not sure).</p><br><p><cite>I wonder though whether people, who left are the ones who were not needed or the ones who din't need MT, because good enough to find good work without much trouble.</cite> That's not a very nice way to put it, since it implies that either the devs or admins who left were not needed (which is not true) or those who stayed are not "good enough" to work somewhere else (which isn't true either).</p>

But if you read what I said, that's not what happened. The devs themselves decided. Some decided to leave, some decided to stay, and it was their <strong>own</strong> decision.</p><p>As players, we don't know what income each game generates. Motion Twin's policy has always been to maintain their games, even old ones after the creator left, and even if it might cost more to keep those games open than to close them. I would say that generally, and not just for MT but for most societies, new games attract lots of players and then the number of players gradually decreases (Hordes / Die2Nite may be an exception, I'm not sure). There are probably differences even among new games, but MT doesn't give that kind of information. They did give some information about Mush, though, and we know that it cost a lot to develop, as it's such a complex game. When Blackmagic worked on updates later on, it was at the detriment of the creation of new games, and therefore, sometimes, it had a financial cost. He did it anyway, until he left.</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1726406 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1726406">sperbi</span></span><cite>Eventually some devs have also just sometimes luck and maybe whole idea of mush was born in a creative collective and blackmagic was chosen as the one to make it possible. I want to believe that.</cite><p>I don't remember exactly who had the original idea for Mush. Maybe it was BM, or maybe it was someone else (maybe <span class="tid_user tid_user_6 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="6">bumdum</span>, whose name inspired Ian's name and who wrote the characters' biographies). Basically, when a dev has an idea, all other MT members discuss it and then chose one or two main devs to create the game. BM was the main developer for Mush, although, as I said, he had help from several other devs, especially during the beta. And he's definitely the one who made it possible for Mush to evolve, since he went on working on the game and improving it after the beta.</p><br><p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8832980 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8832980">jump792</span></span><cite> You would think someone who did all the work on something would have left something...or someone would ask him for help...you guys did ask this person for help understanding his code, right? I get it if he declined, but did you ever ask the guy?</cite> I don't know who you mean by "you guys", but if you mean mods, we are just players and are not part of MT. Blackmagic made sure that the game had enough autonomy to continue without him, for instance the SDF is managed by players (judges and mods), and mods can prepare season changes easily (we just need a dev to validate it). But he also left another dev in charge and, I suppose, with enough information to do it.</p><p>You have to remember that Mush is a complex game, though. The code has to be very complex, but it's not just about the code. Creating the game and updating it represented a lot of work : collecting players' opinions and suggestions, deciding what could be added or changed while keeping the original spirit of the game and its balancing, testing new features and sometimes modifying them...</p><p>Tipyx could probably do updates and modifications, but it would require too much time. He would need to understand the code fully, and also the game, from a player's point of view (he was actually a player before becoming a dev) but from BM's point of view too. And as I said, he doesn't have that time. He needs to work on other games as well, especially on the creation of new games. Blackmagic himself had to work on other games and could not work on Mush full time after the game opened.</p>

                <p>Thanks for some more insights, Peanutz. I also took the time afterwards to check back to the post of MT about the changes and found it.</p><p><a href="/tid/forum#!view/4|thread/49136163" target="_self">Motion Twin 3.0</a></p><p>I also found today some new messages from MT about their current project -Dead cells, which finally seems to be completed soon. So they may be successful with their new way.<br><a href="https://twinoid.com/tid/forum#!view/131563|thread/57060777" target="_blank">https://twinoid.com/tid/forum#!view/1...</a></p><p>I can only wish though their new way is not just developing games interesting for mainstream gamers.<br>I think especially mush is living from its great idea, the strategic, psychologic aspects and the room it lefts for own imagination. Which is probably not, what majority of people seeks.</p><p>Unfortunately it is also just not possible to compare the success for example of Dead cells, when it comes out and mush, since they are shared on different platforms which may lead to wrong conclusions .<br>A game on steam gets probably more easily noticed and promoted. Actually most MT games were almost not promoted at all.<br>Also despite mush is a complex game, there is still the fact it was still possible to develop it by almost only one person while at Dead cells I think many people of MT had to work hard on (well dead cells is currently biggest project of MT, prior to it they went for games which are easier to develop than mush and also compatible with mobile phone like that soccer game or rockefaller or the monster hotel). <br>And a complex game means much more longterm enjoyment, I can't see anything wrong with rather choosing that one...Unless you have not enough money to survive long enough until it is finished of course ^^.<br>Theoretically, even if the player base is leaving such a game, it could be possible to be found and liked by new players... until design, game features and so on are not bearable with the current state of the art of course.</p>

                <p>No, Aceb is not a mod. I, on the other hand, have been a mod on the French server since the beta, and then on the English server. I have seen how the game evolved, how the devs worked on creating and updating it, and also, more generally, how Motion Twin works. If you read sarcasm in my messages, it was the opposite of my intention. I said "I suppose" because they never explained how exactly BM handed the game over to his successor, but one thing is certain, he didn't just say "hey, I'm going, now you take over, see ya". Thinking that he could have done so amounts to saying that he didn't care about his own game and about the players, and that is not true. He did not leave without making sure that his successor would be able to work on the game if necessary. But, again, Mush is a very complex game, with a very complex code. He can't have explained <em>everything</em> in detail, that's just impossible. And in order to make updates, Tipyx would have to go into more detail and doesn't have time for it.</p>

                <p>...I just felt like saying this not to continue to argument, but rather take a change of direction from it being the fault of the people running this game...<br>We as the players have castings yeah? Perhaps it is these very groups that are becoming an aid to this plight? A lot of people are launching ships on castings, likely are coordinated or simply as much as they can. If people are on casting ships, then they aren't gonna get on random ships...and they might even wait to get on these casting ships and make these launches, further leaving them out of random ships...could this be a major reason to this "day 4+" issue? It isn't our intentions, but this could very well be an after effect of our choices...</p>

And the biggest castings that fly "most often" still only do maybe one ship per month.</p><p>Right now, it's December. It's the holidays. People are with family and friends and simply aren't playing online games as much right now. Not that it doesn't take a while normally, but this is maybe the second time I've heard of a day 4 ship still not being filled. It just doesn't happen so often that it requires finding fault with anyone.</p>
