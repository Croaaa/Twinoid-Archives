                <p>Since many people realized a problem on ships with low activity I hope to give some help here at least regarding hunters. Because hunters are in the beginning the biggest problem (and afterwards arises problem with oxygen... regarding that I can only give advice to scan more planets and/or get projects which help to get garden quicker / oxygenated ducts ^^)</p><p>This is for everyone who is not just giving up once they realize their starting position is not optimal.<br>Some advices were said already in this forum by several different people and I added of course also some stuff I know about hunters.</p><br><p>Let's start first with skills, because every active player may think about who to choose or upgrade their beloved crew members with skills to help better to deal with hunters.</p><p><strong>Important skills for dealing with hunters:</strong> <br>(descending in priority)</p><p><strong>Pilot</strong>: Everyone knows it, you can launc ship and land without damaging ship and one pilot should be enough to deal with all hunters, given you have helping hands at the turrets</p><p><strong>Gunner:</strong> You are in beginning (without upgrades) as effective with shooting hunters from turrets as a pilot; if there are only few hunters you are even more effective since pilots need to launch and land.<br>A great skill to aim for after your mush level is fine enough <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Shooter and Creative:</strong><br>Best Combo for Stephen if he has no pilot. With creative you will get often (50% chance) some ap back if you miss a shot. Furthermore this also works if you use shooter points instead of normal aps .<br>Your biggest problem is then still the small firepower (2-4) and small amount of recharges of the turrets though.</p><p>Of course also AP gaining skills are nice or may even overrule some of the mentioned skills.</p><br><p><strong>Strategies for single pilots</strong></p><p>If a pilot is the only pilot the best way (besides getting missions and eating often) to deal with hunters is then to ask for some <strong>turret buddies</strong>.<br>A turret buddy is at same times active as the pilot and is having enough energy to kill some injured hunters from turrets.<br>Then the following strategy is possible:</p><p>The single pilot may aim at hunters and hope for <strong>instakills</strong>. At beginning a shot causes 3-6 damage, so chance to instakill a normal hunters is only 25%.<br>With the upgrade<strong> blaster gun</strong> it gets improved to 50% (4-7 damage) and with additionally decoding of the <strong>rebel base of day 7</strong> it gets improved furthermore to whopping 75% (5-8 ) !</p><p>So if you are failing with instakills, all damaged hunters then have 3 hp at max in beginning. Since a turret shot causes 2-4 damage it is best to leave just hunters with 2 hp for the turret buddies though, which will automatically be the case after at least the rebel base of day 7 is decoded.<br>As rule of thumb you should leave one hurt hunter per full turret at max since a turret buddy may need 4 tries to kill at least one. Since the also need to move to turrets, leave better just 2 injured hunters per turret buddy, maybe three injured ones if they have shooter and creative for example.</p><p>Both pilot and buddies would appreciate it if the <strong>lenses</strong> in lab were researched, which are stacking and helping with accuracy of their shots (though only 3% per lense at turrets since base accuracy of turrets is only lame 30%).<br>Also besides Blaster Gun the project <strong>Teslatron Reservoir</strong> is very helpful as you may accumulate more ap (mission, eating) and kill more hunters in one go, loosing less ap from launching and landing.</p><p>Keep in mind as single pilot and / or <strong>commander!</strong> to be able to <strong>regularily</strong> kill hunters.<br>What do I mean? Hunters are accumulating and if you get not regularily a hunter wave with small amount of hunters, then you will get a big hunter wave at some point.<br>The rule of thumb is that each cycle passing will mean a new hunter, which is adding to the contingent. So waiting for 2 days and no hunter is showing up means a wave of around 16 hunters to aproach then!<br>What you can do? Hunters of the contingent <strong>may be forced to appear</strong>, if the ship gets moved.<br>That means you should at best move the ship if for some cycles no hunters appeared, <strong>but you have enough energy to be able to kill hunters.</strong><br>If ship gets moved then, you can kill easily the triggered hunters and you don't have to worry anymore about big hunter waves coming, it just won't happen since you are always taking care of them, before they can start to grow massively.</p><br><p><strong><br>If you have no pilot or gunner at all:</strong></p><br><p>If you notice this, you should try to find the mushes really quickly and get pilgred up even more quickly, it is also helpful to get <strong>plasma shield</strong> very soon of course.<br>A commander or someone with hacker kit (<strong>after successfull hacking you can move ship btw as often as you want as long as you stay accessed into command terminal!</strong>) may move the ship away when hunters are approaching, but there are the following things to keep in mind:</p><p>- hunters probably don't get lost forever (some stuff and discussion about that I shared already here: <a href="/tid/forum#!view/112222|thread/48447123?p=4" target="_self">DMR - hunter research</a> )<br>That means moving away from hunters results that several cycles later same or an even bigger wave of hunters will appear again. Also since moving is often triggering a part of whole hunter contingent you may see to just keep around same amount of hunters appearing after each moving, which is at least smaller than the whole contingent though.<br>This may not be a problem for a while. You can still survive some days, especially if you have plasma shield, which may defend against around 3-5 hunters without decreasing visibly in defence.<br>But as days increase and amount of fuel is decreasing it gets a problem, so you are playing against time.</p><p>- some hunters can not even be lost temporarily: I mean hunters of class traxes. They will even attack at same cycle you are moving the ship.<br>Also aracks would prevent any ship moving so you need to get rid of aracks and traxes at least after day 5 with turrets</p><p>An interesting idea would be to make use of <strong>pilot drones</strong>, if there is a <strong>robotic expert</strong> skill on board (<strong>magnetic net</strong> is important then too to not loose pilot drones in space) and kill injured hunters the same way as I described it for the turret buddies.</p><p>I haven't seen yet a ship which tried to kill hunters only from turrets (and without gunner skill). I believe though it may be possible, at least with some additional projects/researches like turrets get more capacities (needs <strong>water stick</strong> to find), recharge quicker, you are finding on an expedition an <strong>invertebrated shell</strong> and you are moving regularily to get a regular flow of hunters.<br>Then you <em>just</em> need enough people firing from the turrets until hunters are dead which will take some time though, so you probably need plasma shield at least too.</p><p>Opening pilot lock to be able as non-pilot to launch and shoot at hunters from patrol craft (base accuracy 40% for non-pilots compared to 80% of pilots) for killing hunters is mostly NOT a good idea though since it will always cause the ship hull and the patrol craft hull to take damage from either launching /and/or landing (around 4 hull damage may happen with either action). <br>(<em>This feature is helpful though if you have at least one pilot and you as non-pilot who has possibilities to get masses of AP somehow (coffeine junky etc.) are using the Pasisphae for collecting scrap (every dead hunter enables around one scrap collection action) <br>With <strong>Oscilloscope</strong> everyone (Technicians have NO boost here) may patch up the hull effectively then.</em>)</p><p>That's it for now, if you have some more helpful advices, feel free to share (<em>sperbi falls into sleep tired</em>)</p>

Furthermore this also works if you use shooter points instead of normal aps .<br>Your biggest problem is then still the small firepower (2-4) and small amount of recharges of the turrets though.</cite><p>It is also the best combo for Roland, if he has no Pilot. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br>You can assume that level 6 Stephen always has Apprentice and can get usually get Pilot(same for Roland again). Therefore more interesting would be the question which one is better in the possible cases:<br><em>Pilot/Shooter vs. Pilot/Creative: </em> <br>Pilot/Shooter wins. I'd roughly estimate the break even point to be ~20 shots/day(without lenses. With lenses would be way higher)<br><em>Gunner(Apprentice)/Shooter vs. Gunner(Apprentice)/Creative: </em><br>Gunner/Creative probably wins. This case obviously only happens on a ship with a Pilot problem(otherwise Stephen would copy Pilot). The break-even point here should be at roughly 10-15 shots/day. Considering the turret damage and that there are no other Pilots, this will probably a full-time job with eating anyway.<br><em>Shooter vs. Creative: </em><br>Creative all the way! Break even point should be around 5 shots per day. <br><span class="tid_sideNote">Didn't really consider the increased accuracy after failed shots, but the difference shouldn't be too big.</span></p><p>Shooter is overall better for the high accuracies, while the strength of Creative lies in the number of tries. <br>For low accuracies Creative is far better than Shooter. Not only does it provide more shots, but also boosts other actions such as repairing.</p><br><p><strong>Expert</strong> is another important skill. Sadly it's made obsolete by the lenses and vice versa. This means Andie doesn't need the lenses for the higher accuracy. Nice on ships, where for example Raluca wakes up late and also makes the use of Teslatron-improved patrollers easier as Andie can take more AP-boosts instead of lenses.</p><p><strong>Determined</strong> is another skill, that theoretically helps. In combination with Pilot it barely makes a difference(I believe 99% accuracy instead of 96% after a failed shot). Holding just one lens makes this combo utterly useless. From a turret it's not really better. In fact it's so bad it's usually not even worth considering at all...</p><br><p>As useful project <strong>Targeting Assist</strong> should at least be mentioned. It has basically the same effect as expert, but for all Pilots. Sadly as a gold project it's not commonly available.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">Also it's kinda nitpicking(well, even more than before), but Sniper's Helmet is completely left out as well. Is basically lenses, but it should be named at least somewhere. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></span></p><p>But overall nice guide, that contains more or less everything. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>
