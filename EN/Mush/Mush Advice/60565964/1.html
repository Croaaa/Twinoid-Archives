                <p><strong>The abundance of rules appears grotesque in this chaotic an environment.</strong><br>There is a certain challenge in arriving on late day 4 on a ship at 7 hull, with the ship never filling. 11 on day 5, two inactives sold and two aboard: Fighting it out with 6 humans and a mush on a dying ship can actually have flair. <br>The only reason I enjoyed this game immensely in it's awful state is because I interpret the scenario myself. There is no "unfair" challenge - just a situation. I am choosing a challenge for fun and it is never unfair. <br>On that ship, as the last person standing I burned to make Sol all alone. 2 morale, ~5 O2, 20 hunters on my back: What could be more glorious than that lucky pilgred trade, narrowly turning the impossible for a solo victory? <br>That's an invisible route for those with an all too clear image of "standard gameplay" in their heads.<br>It's a different game.<br>And no, I didn't make it. I could see it though.</p><p><strong>This game has no clear win/loss criteria.</strong> <br><em>Do Beta Mush win if the mush win?</em> If you'd say they win it would follow that it might be an efficient strategy to get turned. That's forbidden. Rightly so? Half/half. The rule is not the red line we can follow towards fair victory, because victory might have us get turned voluntarily at times. Ruling that out needs to be legitimized to be fair and intuitively understood. Neither gameplay nor lore justify this rule. <br>The way I imagine this game to be played has no human freely turn over to the mush. Therefor I find it a good rule to disallow this - on one hand. On the other it is a weak rule, due to lacking any reason besides "it's against our idea how this game should be played".<br><em>Then perhaps Beta Mush actually lose?</em> Wouldn't improve things at all, because then there'd be no reason to play on if infected besides: "There's a rule to enforce desirable gameplay". It doesn't work either.<br><strong>The <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> Glory system</strong> threw all its weight against this problem to incentivise "desirable behaviour". The glory system then proceeded to collapse entirely under this problem's weight, with no other perceivable effects.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> There is no clear win/loss criterion, nor would it be easily possible to introduce one. It would cost the whole infection mechanic. The "secondary win" Eden would need to go as well if a clear win/loss criterion was desired. Neither do I want that nor do I believe you to want it.<br><em>Consequently this game is NOT played for win/loss.</em> The player chooses his objectives freely. He needs to be trusted on it, else there is no game! <br>Now go tell me what a griefer is.</p><p><strong>If you play, you play.</strong><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Griefers</strong> are yesterdays worry! At least I don't care too much. Can't take it anymore? Became paranoid? The voices told you to throw a grenade? Fine! <br><em>I'd much rather see <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/laid.png" alt=":mush_laid:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Inactives</strong> punished.</em><br>If you play, you play. Simple rule, always legitimate as it has already been agreed on by clicking "play". Legitimacy isn't morals: It's order. It is understandability. Clarity. Legitimate rules can be kept. Most present rules lack that.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>A game that is entirely defined by being cultivated,</strong> <br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>an absurd game without winners, </strong><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>should definitely not have an abundance of counter-intuitive rules.</strong><br>The whole game is about communication - nothing else. The skills, win/loss, humanity: It's but a distraction. Allow it to be that absurd play on the meaning of life, the game that <em>isn't</em> incomplete at its core due to a lacking win/loss criterion, because it is a game that simply isn't about winning at all! <br>Allow people to ignore the imminent demise of mankind and rather "build a babel module to seek a peaceful solution with the mush". Allow people to try for that <em>pre-selection Eden</em> and allow that one griefer to hack the Daedalus out of orbit for the lulz, right when the ongoing expo found the final map fragment on day 2. Of course Derek picks a Blaster pre selection - will you please skip on making empty threats against doing so, even calling something as ridiculous as that a rule? It's disgraceful. We gotta live with Janice hugging the grenade, too. For such is mush!</p><p>Embrace the game as is. It does no good to try make it better by messing with its nature.</p><p><em>When the Tao is forgotten, there is righteousness.<br>When righteousness is forgotten, there is morality.<br>When morality is forgotten, there is the law.<br>The law is the husk of faith,<br>and trust is the beginning of chaos.<br>-Laozi, Daodejing, ch.38</em></p>

Not playing for my team, holding items indefinitely: doesn't apply anymore? <br>You know: I never sabotaged my team, nor do I intend to. It's just that "my team" may not include Stephen, be he human or not. That's MY call. I give a damn about your rules when making it and I believe that to be at the core of mush. Perhaps he's inactive, perhaps he just messes up, eats too many rations, holds the hacker kit, whatever: I say he needs to die. That's mush. The "easy formula - period" phrase doesn't get you nowhere here. I for one really don't know where you draw the line and it feels like all the rules are (mostly empty) threats that might be used against me at random.

Thing is: There is no measure. Never. I set my own goals and define what winning is. Is Eden "better" than Sol? Perhaps one should report me if I want to specifically go to a planet with cristalite as a human despite mush still being alive? It's clearly counter productive to invite spores. There's no difference between Sol and Eden in win/loss, right? Or perhaps Eden is the "true win" and I'll report everybody that's outright sabotaging Eden, settling for Sol from the start? Now if a mush aims for Eden and takes unreasonable risks to somehow get to Eden undetected, would that be playing for the win? His mush companion may want to finish it here, much more reliably (and frankly just wants to start a new ship - he hates being mush). Our Eden Mush Jin kills him and gains human trust. He gets reported for his murderous Eden plans. Mush have no business with Eden, right? Perhaps Jin Su does since he even gets personal glory for it? Would his punishment depend on whether or not he successfully went to Eden?<br>Absolutely everything in mush depends on perspective. There's no winning besides meeting your own objectives. Engrave it in mechanics or let people use the mechanics we have freely. <br>I imagine that's what you do anyway - it's just not what "the rules" say.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8729592 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8729592">wLink</span></span><cite>If neutral play rules regarding holding important items pre-selection would get lifted I'd just start grabbing knife, armor and grenade/hacker kit every game before selection, many people would start to do the same. Is this the game you want to play?</cite><p>No offense but it sounds like you didn't ever go there. You <em>can't</em> get all the items. Not with the "no-early-hiding" mechanic anyway, and yes: that one works brilliantly. That's because it makes sure that you can do what you want but need skill and planning for it. If you want to hold onto an item early enough that most of the crew won't ever get a chance to see the log entry for picking it and still hold it a couple of days later, when the ship is full, that's effort. Don't drop it once!<br>Don't tell me you'd just pick "all weapons, armor, medkit, hacker kit and scooter". You won't. You can sneak an item though, perhaps two. Any rule prohibiting that will end up as a lie. Nobody intends to apply it to Derek's Blaster, does anyone? It will be ambivalent: applied here - not so much there. That's hypocrisy and confusing.</p><p>Rules are rules only if they are clear cut and generally apply. If all it is supposed to be is a vague guideline, an etiquette of sorts, then drop Damokles' sword please and put it accordingly. These things don't deserve to be called rules.

Or at least try the whole thing out - maybe it wouldn't turn out to be what you expected.</p><p>So you ask that person to invite you to their house.<br>They do.<br>You come by and oh well.. the moment you step through the fence gate, genuine emotions you just can't hold to yourself start fontaining, as you face the place you've <em>invited yourself</em> into part by part:<br>"Wow! The swimming pool is just way too tiny and needs to be reworked completely! You probably can't even swim in it at all! It would take tons of money and nerves that not everyone posesses, but hey, who cares about that - it's just changing the subject, right?<br>Also someone might say this garden is nice, but if all the flowerbeds get changed to trees - that would actually be the only thing that'd make this place enjoyable at all..."<br>Then you enter the house and oh my god.. "Whoa! The whole design of this place is wrong! The walls and room locations should be changed completely and redone from scratch in order to make it comfortable!.. Hell, we'd have o start from making it at least <em>bearable</em>, I guess! Damn, the designers have probably never even heard of such a thing as usability!..<br>And.. uhh.. the couch!.. Eugh! that booze collection!.. Wow, hah! Is that Jack Daniels I'm seeing over there? Did you know that it's not whiskey at all? Guess not, cos you probably just mix it with coke anyways.. Oh my! The lightning and the color schemes!.. there's so much more coming on that advice story, but good god, buddy! Why. Are. You. DRESSED?! Tell me, eh?! Tell me! Who walks around their own house being dressed, I swear! I, for one, never do! Clearly you need to fix this in the very first place and then we can continue!"<br>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Would you, yourself, make such a person a cup o'tea, mm? <img src="//data-monsterhotel.twinoid.com/goalImg/7e96ff694f4a2d3f7529a4213df5fee4" alt=":monsterhotel_beer_10:" class="tid_img tid_parsed" style=""></p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">PS: it's really a shame there's no tea cup icon in mush O:</span></p>

                <p>I am not actually sure from what standpoint you are trying to argue "against the rules" here.</p><p>If it is an angle of practicality (i.e. whether the rules have reasons behind them, whether they are just and whether they are actually enforced - which all is definition of "applying the rules", as far as I can say), as seems to be the case, then stand assured the rules <strong>do</strong> apply. Every single one of them was created either for the game to be played as intended by its creator or to make sure the game is as fair as possible towards the players. And they are also effectively enforced - first by community who are, as individuals, free to report any activity suspected to be against them, and then by judges and moderators who evaluate these reports, have access to logs and make sure the offenders are sanctioned, if they actually broke any rules. It might not be the most objective and efficient system imaginable, but it surely is most objective and efficient system possible for browser game where development was concluded and all this work is done by volunteers.</p><p>If you are arguing from philosophical standpoint, then I'm afraid Mush is not the only game you might have problem. In chess, for example, what does force you to move with bishop only diagonally? Or in soccer - why can't you pick up a ball and run towards opponents goal, while others are trying to just kick it around? Who does stop you to break those rules?<br>The answer is social contract. If you agree to play a game, you, by default, agree to follow the rules. If you don't, then you don't play the game. You just ruin it for others. Sure, you can do homerules with your group of friends (and that's why we have castings on Mush) but when playing with random strange people, there's some default rule setting you are expected to follow. That's just the way games work.</p><p>And of course, there's a last reason you might have started this thread - to look for ways to bend the rules, find loopholes and rationale for breaking them. You wouldn't be the first and probably not even the last. And as with others before you, you will end up with deleted posts, locked thread and maybe even forum ban. So tread carefully.</p>

                <p>I like the game a lot. Also thanks for taking the time to answer! It is appreciated, although we disagree.</p><p>So far nobody ever cared about the items rule in my few games and I only heard about it in my ongoing game. A game where people hugged items from the start, like all my previous games. Aparently the rule isn't enforced unless players report it. It's not a rule as in: "This is law" but much rather a weapon that could be used against you <em>if</em> you get reported. So I don't get reported and people do as they see fit, constantly "playing wrongly". Shall I report them all or join them? Not ideal. Blurred lines and all. <br>Boardgamer: I am used to rules that are being kept at all times, by everybody. Playing the game means applying the rule. Much more akin to game mechanics rather than that soft moralistic indicator you call a "rule". Like grenades &amp; BIOS: That's a good rule for griefing grenadiers! Not to be able to hide objects early is also good. The out for early expeditions is a bit much imo. The soft rules do not find my appreciation, sorry to say. The game's design is ingeniously daring in not offering a clear win condition. I love it for that! To row back on that in regret doesn't do it justice.<br>Personally I've seen literally no insults. Some rudeness perhaps, all very civilized still. Not sure where all the evil creatures lurk we'd need to be protected from.<br>Create a game that allows for cultivation and give it time, then it'll thrive! Or so I believe. Just because they will be childish doesn't mean they can't mature. Also it's a game: What better place to be childish?</p><p>As a matter of fact I also wonder: Why not create my own game? Then again we both know a myriad of down-to-earth answers to that. I like this game. I think it could be even better. Why not just invest into this one, in play and in discussion?</p>

                <p>Thing is, most of the "soft" rules can't be implemented via mechanics - it's simply impossible (like, say, playing for your team or holding onto objects).<br>Another thing - if you phrase them in a too strickt and detailed way, they'd turn into somthing similar to real life laws. No one would even try reading all up to the end, not even mentioning understanding and remembering.</p><p>If you haven't faced rude or aggressive people - you are really lucky, but, IMO, there're plenty of both kinds. Same as those who crash Icarus before the game even starts (that's why the disabling pre-selection expos was born; and yes, it is sort of a bummer, but it is sooooooo much better then otherwise, really; also it's a good way of dealing with griefers)</p><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_9704668 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="9704668">Zadok</span><br><cite>So I don't get reported and people do as they see fit, constantly "playing wrongly".</cite> &lt;&lt; until someone finally does :p which mostly happens sooner than later, too.</p><p><cite> Not sure where all the evil creatures lurk we'd need to be protected from.</cite> I believe, that's actually <em>because</em> the rules do exist and are enforsed.

Spoiling the game fun (or ability to play at all) for other players (=majority) is a very different, usually. Though it's too subjective of a term when it comes for playing, whatever sort of game is being discussed: someone might concider a kid, hitting another kid with a huge stick during playing, eg, while chasing them, just "childish", but I doubt the hit child would (especially if it harms them badly). General blunt example, but illustrates the point fine, I guess.</p>

And they are also effectively enforced - first by community who are, as individuals, free to report any activity suspected to be against them, and then by judges and moderators who evaluate these reports, have access to logs and make sure the offenders are sanctioned, if they actually broke any rules. It might not be the most objective and efficient system imaginable, but it surely is most objective and efficient system possible for browser game where development was concluded and all this work is done by volunteers.</cite><p>You've got my thanks for that work then Patches! <br>It certainly wasn't my intend to criticise the actual system.

I love how the game works w/o a true win condition. That's like the big no-no yet it works!

We were almost always in crisis before there were mush. The one griefer I saw was a net loss no doubt but perfectly in tune with everything else: just another obstacle. Can't change it anymore than Sprinter Roland or inactive Eleesha. The rules seem to say it shouldn't be like that. But then mush has that miraculous ability to turn it all into a challenge, into an even more pronounced scenario. That's one special game that does such things.</p><p>Now I may have argued for the wrong side here I guess. Didn't mean to step into a warzone, nor to invite vicious griefers. I'll gladly leave it to you to sort out all sorts of trouble before it even reaches me &lt;3</p>

                <p>There <strong>are</strong> true win conditions, actually. This is a survival and mush-hunting game, so the basic conditions are quite obvious. If you don't survive at a survival game, you lose. If you don't find the mush, you also lose, just like you lose if you play Cluedo and don't find the murderer. Same thing for the mush, they win if they survive and lose if they die.</p><p>Defining other conditions would be much too subjective, and every time people have tried to define win conditions, they failed to reach a consensus, because there are too many possible criteria.</p><p>As for rules, in some cases we have to have clear-cut rules (for instance, we cannot allow suicide at all, because if we said "suicide is allowed if the ship is really doomed", people would kill themselves left and right since "doomed" is a very personal notion). In other cases, we cannot define absolute rules. We can't forbid humans to kill other humans, it's impossible in an investigation games where innocents can be suspected and killed. But we can't completely allow it either, or griefers would have a field day.</p>
