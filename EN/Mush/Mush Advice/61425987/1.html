                <p>First of all, <strong><em>don't make Antispore Gas</em></strong> as the first research. It's not practical, it's a flawed meta. You may ask for an explanation, but it might take a separate post. If you're Finola, convince people to help with <strong>Constipaspore Serum</strong> or <strong>MycoAlarm</strong>. Then the second of these. The next should be <strong>Mycoscan</strong>. Once Mush dies, immediately go for <strong>Mushovore Bacteria</strong>. You may even consider <strong>Natamy Rifle</strong>, <strong>Spore Sucker</strong> or Mushicide Soap (but this one is glitched and people might feel unfair upgrading their soap with living Mush). Don't go for Antispore Gas. It's a waste unless you suspect you might have already got some Betas on board, this sure would annoy Betas, but generally, it's useless.</p><p>As silver, don't imagine any combos without Medic. About taking another skill:</p><ul><li><strong>Biologist</strong> - great boost early game, although it comes quite useless late game when the research is done. With this skill, you're able to complete all the basic anti-Mush research on the day of selection. It's highly recommended when there are no other biologists on board and even the starting Mage Book doesn't satisfy you.</li><li><strong>Diplomat</strong> - it greatly improves chances of Eden if you actively participate during expeditions. Simply take it when there are no other diplomats onboard and printed Mage Books from Xyloph still didn't satisfy you. Keep in mind you may still save a slot in case the other diplomat dies (mainly because of Mush).</li><li><strong>Nurse</strong> - a decent perk in the late game, it's useful as your main task would be healing once research is done. You may consider taking this if you've already researched what's been useful, better than being a reserve diplomat.</li><li><strong>OCD</strong> - simply when your apron is gone but you really consider spending XP for this skill?</li></ul><p>Playing as <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><em>Mush</em></strong>, your gameplay should depend on your partner's capabilities.</p><ul><li>If your partner is going to actively make <strong>and use</strong> spores, the strategy is either:<ul><li>classic: give humans a reason not to kill you and do research, but don't complete a research that would be a burden for your partner. Remember that the research doesn't affect you as you're not making spores. Rushing Antispore Gas and showing determination is a very good idea. A single partner shouldn't make more than 2 spores a day although it might be a trouble if you get a Beta, but getting one is already a win. Another perk is gaining trust by humans as they're relying on the gas as a child to a lollipop.</li><li>explicit: reveal yourself! You're better off letting them know you're Mush than being an obstacle to your partner as a researcher. But not literally. Simply you should help your partner. Remember that dying you let the humans make Mushovore Bacteria which is a quick research. Your aim is to bring the greatest advantage for your partner after intending to be revealed. You may use diplomat skill and spike a human after removing a camera before day change then spike again on the next day. Reading technician book to dismantle Mush Genome Disk, Tabulatrix and a few of cameras? Whatever you do, you should be remembered as not helping human even once.</li><li>stable: don't help human, don't reveal yourself... yet. It depends on the human if you get killed sooner or later. You may just stay in the Medlab as no one disturbs you and triple-contaminate morale pills. Once you're found dirty, you're screwed, but who would come to visit you? You may also pretend to be AFK but it's lame, although still better than helping with research.</li></ul></li><li>If your partner is a decent player but unable to find opportunities to make spores throughout the game or the spore production is very limited and slow either:<ul><li>improvise: co-operate with your partner so one of you can have an opportunity to make spores and potentially convert somebody even for the cost of sacrificing one of you.</li><li>mimic: simply pretend to be human and look for opportunities. Rush with research as it doesn't affect any of you and sound genuine to humans. Remember that you must act if there are too few non-confirmed people onboard.</li></ul></li><li>When your partner is inactive or not smart enough to survive this ship simply go mimicking human waiting for opportunities.</li><li>Also, rampage is also a thing in all cases.</li></ul><p><br><br>Tricks and tips:</p><ul><li>You may consider bringing the apron with you on expo if there's no risk of losing an item. Keep in mind that others could use the apron and the Mush might find an excuse to get dirty while gardening.</li><li>You might use private channels to co-operate with other researchers and find a cycle to burn all your Action Points for relaying.<ul><li>You may also keep research progress in a private channel, as it's more useful for Mush than human. Also, once research's done is not announced unless they look at the bottom bar. They could fail to make spores <em>(since when it costs 4 AP?)</em> or even fall under MycoAlarm trap without realizing its existence.</li></ul></li><li>As determined Mush hunters usually focus on counting Action Points of those who had an opportunity to get dirty rather than the rest, you as Mush may "borrow some AP" to your partner. Make some additional research progress as your partner claims to have participated in it or water plants while you're relaying research so your partner can claim to have watered them instead. Your partner shouldn't forget to leave logs accessing research lab and grabbing the apron.</li></ul>

                <p>I've been Mush 38 times. ASG was being picked very frequently as first research but this hardly ever affected the Mush gameplay. Half of the games my Alpha partner was either inactive or unable to find an opportunity to wash from dirtiness. I didn't have any reason to produce more than 2 spores a day unless I had accumulated AP prior selection and was going to make some infection on the first day... before any research had a chance to be done. When I had an active partner and we both were doing spores: either we were able to make spores before any research was done and later we didn't have any opportunity to make more as we didn't use more than 2 spores a day. The most crucial thing is that <strong>even if we were actively using spores and once we wanted to extract more but we hit the limit - we just <em>waited for another day to make the next spores</em>.</strong> The Action Points we were planning to spend on extracting spores - we spent them on doing human stuff so we would be better hidden and more trustworthy to humans. So all you do making ASG is just delaying the spore extraction and make Mush less likely to be detected regardless if they want to do what they have to or play risky by extracting more in one day.</p><p>ASG is not a free research. It's being done at 6-9% base efficiency. At the same efficiency is being done working on Constipaspore Serum and MycoAlarms. It means that if you complete ASG, at the same rate CS or MA could be completed but you refused them so ASG was made instead. However, CS and MA are more worth doing as the first and second anti-Mush research than ASG.</p><p>CS is a better research than ASG because:</p><ul><li>When there's s rampage and Mush eats freshly produced spores, ASG decreases AP gain by 4 points. Taking Mycelium Spirit, the Phagocyte rampage is even more efficient. CS <strong>prevents</strong> any AP gain from freshly produced spores on phagocyting. Even with Mycelium Spirit - no matter how many spores you're able to produce, CS doesn't give any AP gain from this. Once knowing this, ASG followers had arguments that <em><strong>Fertile skill is countering CS as it bypasses the expensive cost of a spore</strong></em>. They're right, but it doesn't mean that ASG is a useful research, because <strong>we're dealing with 2 Alphas and even if both of them took Fertile+Phagocyte</strong>, <em>which is rare for two randoms on a ship to have a high-level skill,</em> <strong>they can gain AP from consuming only 2 free spores at most,</strong> so ASG doesn't limit it at all. Thus, for Phagocyte rampage, ASG is worthless when you have CS.</li><li>CS makes spore production 4 AP instead of 2 AP. It means that making more than 2 spores a day requires being really incapacitated in doing human stuff. It helps investigators to find the Mush. With ASG done over CS, the Mush will make spores at a cheap cost. If you think that extracting 2 spores for a Mush in somehow detectable, then what about a single spore with CS? If there are no investigative people to deal with the Mush, the ship is screwed either way.</li><li>With CS, 4 AP cost is forever. With ASG, it wears off over a day. About Fertile, it could also wear off over a day, but for 2 fertile Alphas, there are only 2 free spores, although Mycelium Spirit would be a better skill in ASG presence for mass spore production. ASG is still worthless as you help the Mush in hiding themselves due to the limit as they'll use the AP, which were supposed to be spent on extracting spores, for doing human stuff.</li></ul><p>MA is much more powerful research than ASG whereas:</p><ul><li>MycoAlarms are <strong>the only</strong> devices that can <strong>prevent</strong> triple-contamination of food, especially fruit, pills, anabolics and coffee, which guarantees conversion upon consumption unless Chun consumes it. Those are really needed in Lab and Medlab as stocks of consumables are usually stored there.</li><li>It guarantees that all people on board will be protected from directly spiking, especially those inactive in corridors that are a subject for Anonymush.</li><li>Unless the Mush knows the location of MAs, once they're hidden, the Mush will be most likely give up trapping, contaminating food and directly spiking people. The ship has 27 rooms. 6 of them are turrets, 5 storages, there's also a garden where no one goes. Once you clear 3 corridors of items, you have 12 rooms left. With 5 cameras, you only put MA in 5 of 7 remaining areas and it's a great risk of the Mush to expose themselves if they go trapping rooms. If there are only 3 cameras, there's even more reason to make MycoAlarms as there are plenty of areas where the Mush can convert people.</li></ul><p>Inferring, CS and MA are the most optimal research for start, as they prevent an effective rampage and stealth converting no matter how many spores they can produce. It's inevitable to make them extract spores, but with these pieces of research are done you make them impossible to use these spores.</p><p>Once you make CS and MA, consider creating Mycoscan in order to prevent any kind of stealth conversion, as people may frequently check themselves after performing actions in unsecured areas, as there are some unsecured areas which can be contaminated only by a trap. ASG doesn't help as converting a person with a trap requires several days, while the double amount of spores will be being produced. You should consider inventing a Spore Sucker to remove spores if those happen to be in human's body.</p><p>ASG is only worth doing if you suspect there's more than 2 agents of Mush but with MA done it's nearly impossible to successfully convert somebody.</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8744424 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8744424">izpodtishka</span></span><cite><p>How exactly is AG useless when 2 spores a day less can make a significant difference in case mush are planning a convertion rush or a rampage on daychange?<br>While CS for sure is the best one to go as the first research, AG is a good one to follow it, early game.</p><p>Plus you’re insisting on research order like it’s a one-and-only-efficient-way.

Or MB. In majority of ships I’ve played MB was just useless, due to mush dying early and evidence showing that no one has more than one spore at best.)</p></cite><p>If Mush goes on conversion rush on day change, the ASG will just limit the number of produced spores to 4 (2 spores * 2 days). Even with both Infectors, they can use the whole spore limit on conversion. Also, with CS done they'll be unable to extract more than 2 spores unless they become Fertile. Even if then, they'll be unable to use more spores regardless if ASG is done or not. The problem is with Betas making spores, where ASG could affect, but with Fertile Infector Mush, they'll also be able to become Mycelium Spirit as they'll have obtained high-level skills by that point. And if you witness a conversion rush, you better make Natamy Rifle rather than ASG, which is being done at 6-9% base efficiency, the same as ASG. Natamy Rifle can destroy a bunch army of Mush throughout the cycles, ASG will just reduce the spore reduction by 2, but you should focus on fighting the Mush at that point.</p><p>Rampage is ineffective with CS done and doing ASG over CS is a mistake there. With ASG, they'll make 4 spores instead of 8 and a single Mush can be enough for the whole Phagocyte rampage, the limit is increased by 2 per Mycelium Spirit. With CS, they'll be forced to take Fertile to eat at most 4 spores with both rampaging Mush, regardless of spore limit.</p><p>And about how the research should be done, just do whatever is more powerful than ASG. I used to tell people which research to do one by one, just don't let them come to an idea of making ASG, it's just a waste of AP, which you would like to spend on the more useful research. The order I provided shouldn't be that strict.</p><p>I consider MB being useful after Mush is gone, in case you hit hidden traps or Cristalite zones.</p>

                <p>Dude, no one here seemed to argue that CS is a higher priority than AG, yet you keep textwalling about it.<br>My only point was that <strong><em>ASG is not useless</em></strong>.<br>Which you keep insisting on, though it's just your <strong><em>personal subjective position</em></strong>.<br>Even from your own words: "I didn't have any reason to produce more than 2 spores a day.." I don't see a conclusion that everyone else wouldn't have that reason. I, for one, did. And yes, the "going to make some infection on the first day... before any research had a chance to be done" can be one of those - CS not being finished within the first day of selection happens often). But even with CS finished, 4 spores a day means you can, for example:<br>1) rush-convert someone within one day (I consider it important cos if you want to get a good member for the team - you'd have to target experienced high-level players, who are mostly vigilant on daychange, so the daychange convert is a no guarantee).<br> 2) With starting spores on you can convert 3 people on daychange instead of just 2 if AG is finished (with or without CS done). If it's done - you can't make a single convertion within a day and not more than 1 on daychange unless you have stockpiled spores from a previous day. <br>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_1598888 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1598888">Dzanek</span><cite>at the same rate CS or MA could be completed but you refused them so ASG was made instead</cite>Why instead?

I still can phago all the spores I've extracted or those I get for Fertile and gain 4 ap. I still can convert people via DTT. I still can contaminate food and offer to people when they trust me. I still can contaminate via DTT. And I bet majority of people won't notice how I've cleared the logs in a bay or turret, especially on daychange. I can take AD beds with my partner and convert the 3rd (and even 4th) person and no one would likely notice lack of logs few cycles ago (if they even go there for some reason with all beds occupied).</p>

                <p>I tried to say everything about ASG. Sorry if I didn't sound clear at some certain points. ASG is not useless, that's right, it's better than nothing. However, my point is that <strong><em>ASG is not worth doing over other parts of research.</em></strong> My first paragraph was indeed subjective. This was just my point about how I realized the overestimation of ASG.</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8744424 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8744424">izpodtishka</span></span><cite>But even with CS finished, 4 spores a day means you can, for example:<br>1) rush-convert someone within one day (I consider it important cos if you want to get a good member for the team - you'd have to target experienced high-level players, who are mostly vigilant on daychange, so the daychange convert is a no guarantee).<br> 2) With starting spores on you can convert 3 people on daychange instead of just 2 if AG is finished (with or without CS done). If it's done - you can't make a single convertion within a day and not more than 1 on daychange unless you have stockpiled spores from a previous day.</cite><p>About the first case, converting somebody in public will result in the Mush being killed. Also, most people can directly infect once per day so they'll be unable to convert anyone in the middle of day unless somebody has been already got a spore. MA may prevent this case if there are no starting spores. Another exception is if somebody got an Infector skill, but by that point even if you somehow get ASG done and they plan to extract spores at that time to convert in the same cycles, the Infector may take Mycelium Spirit if limit pops in.</p><p>About the second case, it depends on the active Infectors. Keep in mind that spores could have already been extracted, so the Mush might go at full infection without the need to extract more spores over a limit with ASG. Also, with CS done and Ian in the room, the Mush may not be able to use their full AP bar for full infection efficiency.</p><br><p><cite>You can just postpone alarms and do them next. Finishing them day later is unlikely to change much. Plus generally you need Chun to hide them and she 1) can be unavailable for that (for enough time to finish AG in the meantime :B) 2) might have to gain AP for hiding (if she's active - she usually spends most on research).</cite></p><p>Postponing MA for another day may change much. The Mush may triple-contaminate banana if all pots are planted. They may take another day to convert people in Icarus Bay who are waiting to launch an expo on a starting planet or a planet that's already been found pre-selection. They may also take a day to convert an idle person in unsecured area. Neither of these things require any high level skill and even an amateur might know how to take Anonymush after conversion and take an easy win. Lack of MA is the main reason for those ships ending up with Anonymush in Sol.</p><p>Chun is not required to put MycoAlarms in unsecured areas where people are staying. Once somebody is really trusted (they usually go for "confirmed humans"<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">, the trusted may hide the MycoAlarms if the crew wants to find the Mush or scare them away from infecting.</p><p><cite>This..doesn't really seem to make sense. I still can phago all the spores I've extracted or those I get for Fertile and gain 4 ap. I still can convert people via DTT. I still can contaminate food and offer to people when they trust me. I still can contaminate via DTT. And I bet majority of people won't notice how I've cleared the logs in a bay or turret, especially on daychange. I can take AD beds with my partner and convert the 3rd (and even 4th) person and no one would likely notice lack of logs few cycles ago (if they even go there for some reason with all beds occupied).</cite></p><p>Maybe I didn't sound clear when I said the Mush couldn't use the spores. Of course, the Mush can eat 2 spores they stored, no research can stop them from consuming already extracted spores. People don't DTT with living Mush unless it's Chun or both "confirmed humans" themselves. Most people are paranoid enough not to trust any food left in unsecured areas with a living Mush. Also, you might not know if there's a MycoAlarm in the room you're contaminating food. Even less people notice defaced log, but if you get to the point where no one in dorms knows what's going on in their rooms, even ASG won't help them. If you know how to trick them, good job. Some people aren't even aware when a camera was removed in a dorm, which logs weren't defaced.</p>

                <p>There's no need to hide mycoalarms either, basically they act as a camera that detects more actions with exception of extracting and it doesn't show names. And why wouldn't you want 5 extra cameras? ASG is useful but in an average game it does way less impact than alarms do. Although I wouldn't usually go as far as doing Mycoscan before ASG unless I had strong suspicion someone got spored in a season without starting spores and I wanted to confirm that. In most of games I played Mycoscan did nothing but confirmed mushes have been laying low.</p><p>ASG gets considerably good if you're excepting several brute conversion, usually in dorm paired with defacer/ceasefire(s). However you rarely see those plays on typical public ships.</p><p>I never used Slimetrap personally but mush Finola could use it for an excuse to get dirty if there's no camera in Lab (but keep in mind that an observant crew will take note of who might have slimetrapped who so you're potentially narrowing down list of suspects for them) or to frame humans.</p><p>If you're mush Finola you can try to convince crew to place Chun in medlab bed if she's active so that nobody will risk getting converted in Medlab. However getting bed in BD is no guarantee in that case.</p>

                <p>Why is there no need to hide mycoalarms ? In some rooms there is no point hiding them (Icarus Bay, medlab, Nexus or bridge) because any mush with a bit of experience knows those rooms are protected. But they never know which other rooms have been chosen to hide the remaining alarms.</p><p>Cameras, and mycoalarms when they're not hidden, have a dissuasive effect. But it's like pheromodem : if the mush know that they can't do anything, then they won't even try. And although it sounds like a good thing, it is also counter-productive for the mush-hunt because there is nothing to investigate. If the mush know what rooms are protected by a mycoalarm, they won't trap that room, infect food or spike anyone in it. Instead, they will do it elsewhere and you will have no way to find out. But if they don't know, there is a chance that they will get tricked by a mycoalarm and you can catch them red-handed.</p>

                <p>Well, my main point was to explain how ASG is useless. <span class="tid_user tid_user_8744424 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8744424">izpodtishka</span> has already proven me wrong. ASG can slow down conversion rush. The Mush sometimes fails to manage spores and extracts more than they can use while their partners are left sporeless.</p><p>However, I still think ASG shouldn't be done over any other anti-Mush research that could provide benefits we don't have yet. Conversion rush happens really rarely. Things that happen more often than this:</p><ul><li>Rampages, which can't be debuffed with <strong>Constipaspore Serum</strong> <strong><em>exclusively</em></strong>.</li><li>Conversion through triple-contaminated food and making idle humans look like Alpha Mush, which can be countered by <strong>MycoAlarms</strong>. Once they're put on the shelf, the Mush has to give up their plan as picking them up results in insta-death and corridor/bay deface doesn't happen so often. There are still people alerting missing logs from a few cycles before although the logs are legit.</li><li>Booby-traps, which can be revealed after hiding a <strong>MycoAlarm</strong> and once <strong>Mycoscan</strong> is done, the Mush will also give up with this idea as they might be revealed as soon as the trapped person goes scanning.</li><li>Any other kind of slow infecting even when it's made sure it's an unsecured area, people still can go for <strong>Mycoscan</strong> and <strong>Spore Sucker</strong> to waste the Mush efforts.</li></ul><p>Once again, things that happen more often than this:</p><ul><li>Pilots complaining inaccurate shots, so you gotta make <strong>NCC Lenses</strong> for them.</li><li>Medics want more AP and shrinks some morale, build <strong>Narcotics Distiller</strong> for yourself.</li><li>Healing spends more time, upgrade the Medikit with <strong>Ultra-Healing Pomade</strong>.</li></ul><p>The Mush pattern is that either they rampage if they see weapons on sight or inactive wrestler candidate on board or play hidden waiting for opportunities to infect people without getting revealed at all costs or playing human to wait until the ship falls off so they can finish off people or reveal themselves early in a noobish way or go inactive. I don't see any reason to put a priority on ASG on a ship which looks ordinarily - everybody doing their human work.</p>
