                <p><strong><em>Here are some useful tips to make it less likely that you die of Asphyxation.</em></strong><br>depending on how much oxygen is left, there are different strategies for keeping up oxygen.</p><p><strong>16-32 o2 left in the tanks (more than 50%)</strong><br>main O2 source: <strong>Gardening</strong><br>16 o2 is still plenty. If you get 24 or 16 oxygen from an expedition then your tank will be maxed out. If you find only 8 o2 or the pump fail, you will still have at least 1 day to find another planet.<br>Your main goal at this stage should be to keep your plants alive and healthy, so a full tank will last much longer.</p><p>I made a small python program to calculate how long o2 will last, from how many o2 you currently have, what cycle you are currently in and how many mature plants you have (assuming you can keep them all healthy)<br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.file-upload.net/download-10734287/mush_oxygen.py.html">O2 Calculator</a></p><p>All assuming you have 32 o2 (full tank), starting in c1:<br><strong>0</strong> plants: o2 will last 32 cycles (4 days)<br><strong>1</strong> (mature, healthy) plant: o2 will last 36 cycles (4.5 days) <br>36 is also the amount of cycles, that a banana will grow, so just keeping 1 plant alive, can carry you long enough until you have 1 more mature plant.<br><strong>2</strong> plants - each ship starts with 2 mature plants : o2 will last 42 cycles (5.25 days)<br><strong>3</strong> plants - o2 will last 47 cycles (5.875 days)<br><strong>4</strong> plants - o2 will last 60 cycles (7.5 days)<br><strong>5</strong> plants - o2 will last 77 cycles (9.625 days) - you can survive for almost 10 days, just by planting your starting pots and keeping them alive, if you manage to do just <em>one</em> successful expedition for refilling your tank to max.<br><strong>6</strong> plants - o2 will last 110 cycles (13.75 days)<br><strong>7</strong> plants - green thumb skill - o2 will last 207 cycles (25.875 days)<br><strong>8+</strong> plants - extra hydropot project - if you can keep them alive and healthy, and tanks wont break, then your o2 will last forever, because you can fully recover the daily o2 loss.</p><p>Keeping your plants alive increases the efficiency of how long the o2 gained from an expedition will last. More healthy plants means your planet scanners will have more time to find good and <em>safe</em> oxygen planets. If you don't take care of your plants, you will have to do an expedition every 4th day, which means you may be desperate enough to be going to that oxygen planet, which also has a mankarog. Make sure Ian is doing is job. (unfortunately Ian seems to be a character that seems to be very appealing to newbies. After all, gardening doesn't sound that hard, right?)</p><p>In the first 3-4 days (when your bananas are not mature yet) it might also help to do a few expeditions for <em>harvest</em> Zones, instead of desperately trying to find that o2 planet. Each plant that you can find, (reaching maturity faster than a banana), will increase the efficiency of your expeditions to future o2 planets.<br>Zones with harvest chance: High Temp (more likely to get fatigue), <strong>Forest</strong> (good chances for fruit, risk of MIA), Mountains (accidents are more likely), <strong>Orchard</strong> (best chances for getting fruit), <strong>Swamp</strong> (good chance for fruit). There are 3 beneficial zones if you are trying to get plants, instead of just 1 beneficial zone, if looking for O2 - so this should be much easier.</p><p><strong>8-16 o2 left in the tanks (more than 25%)</strong><br>main O2 source: <strong>Expeditions</strong><br>At this point you want to find a good O2 planet and move into orbit.<br>Your O2 is <em>capped</em> at 32, so if you have more than 8 O2 still and get the best possible expedition outcome (24 o2), then all excess o2 is <em>wasted</em>, so you probably want to delay the expedition launch as much as possible. (provided you don't have to flee from hunters)<br>it may also be a good idea if some people take out o2 of the tanks, before launching, and then refill the tank when the expo is done, to avoid going over the cap.</p><p><strong>2-8 o2 left in the tanks (less than a day worth of oxygen)</strong><br>main O2 source: <strong>Oxygen Capsules</strong><br>If you can just insert enough capsules into your tank, to survive another day change, then your plants will be producing oxygen, which can buy you additional time.<br>Ideally, your pilots stockpile several capsules early on, but only open them once you have less than a day worth of oxygen. Otherwise you just risk wasting o2 by going over the cap after a successful expedition.</p><p><strong>1 o2 left in the tanks (gasp. I'm out of breath)</strong><br>Someone <strong>will </strong>die next cycle if you don't have any capsules left to refill your tank.<br>Protect your most important persons, by having them take the last capsule.<br>Note: At any oxygen level <em>other than 1</em>, it should be considered very selfish to steal oxygen capsules, because it will make people die of asphyxation sooner. However, it makes no difference at all, if there is 0 o2 in the tank or if there is 1 o2 in the tank. The first person will die, when the o2 levels <em>hit</em> 0 for the first time at cycle change.<br>discuss with your crew, who is the most important person on your ship and should get the last capsule.<br>VIP persons to protect:<br>- Chun (if mush still alive, to ensure human survival)<br>- Commander (to move you to oxygen planets)<br>- Astrophysicists, Gardeners, Pilots -(the people who have to work hard to get you out of this bad situation.)<br>- Technicians - for finishing pilgred</p>
