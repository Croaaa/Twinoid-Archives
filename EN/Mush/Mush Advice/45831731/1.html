                <p><span class="tid_mod">Hello mushlings, and welcome to the third iteration of this thread! This post and thread should help clarify what is reportable/sanctionable or not. If you have any questions regarding the rules or which behaviour you could report, please, ask here.<br><br>If you have a question regarding a sanction you've received or wish to speak to us personally, send us a <a target="_blank" href="http://twinoid.com/tid/groupDiscuss">message</a>.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/qLXA0g/0">Rules of English Mush</a> <br><br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_warning.gif" alt=":hordes_!!:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_warning.gif" alt=":hordes_!!:" class="tid_ico"><br><em><strong>When reporting rule breaking on your ships, please, you must type in a reason for the report! In If you leave it blank, the judges have to pick through the whole ship's logs to find out what went on.<br><br>We've found a glitch in reports where a reported private message of any kind (to your self, blank or with others) will send in a blank report. We have the logs but the judges don't know why the report was made so it's very important that we do not report private messages of any kind, find a random post in main chat to report, if you have to. Do not report PMs. We'll let you know when this is fixed!<br><br>In addition, do not just type, "Griefer". More information will only help us. </strong></em><br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_warning.gif" alt=":hordes_!!:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_warning.gif" alt=":hordes_!!:" class="tid_ico"><br><br>Anonymity<br>Many find anonymity to be one the best features of this game and choose to keep anonymity at all times. There is no Twinoid fame in Mush, no long time member hero worship and you are free to role play the character you've chosen without anyone knowing who you really are. Because most of us do want to keep our anonymity and not know the identity of others on our ships, we strongly suggest everyone preserve anonymity because it's more enjoyable to play that way.<br><br><br>Spreadsheets, other tools, and external communication<br>We won't be sanctioning for spreadsheet use. That said, there will plenty of time for total organization in private ships when they come. Spreadsheet encouragement on public ships is often futile as not everyone will use them and remember, the mush can see them as well and destruction of important documents is a valid mush strategy. Lists can also lead to tensions as the super organized might pressure the under organized. You can post your link once and please, don't expect new players or those who would rather stay in game to use these tools.<br><br>A note on IRC use - while it's very convenient its use is discouraged on public ships. No one will be sanctioned for using it nor scolded on the forums (/me puts his whip away) it must be used very carefully. IRC logs cannot be used to contest a sanction because like screenshots, they can be tampered with. All pertinent information gleaned from an IRC conversation must be summarized in game. This is the only way for the SDF to see the evidence of the ship's happenings.<br><br><br>Inactivity or Idlers<br>Inactivity (new players, players not communicating or playing) will not be sanctioned, do not report them. We do not want to sanction new players who might not be engaged. Learning to work around these players is part of our game. You *can* succeed on as ship that has many deaths and/or a fair number of inactive players. Luck and team work amongst those left will be in order but it can be done. Thoughtful communication and patience can go a long way.<br><br>There are a couple, very specific, instances of inactivity or perceived inactivity which can be reported. If there is proof of idling for XP farming without actually playing, this can be reported. Proof though would include an admission of this type of activity. Widespread idling for XP gain isn't happening and it shouldn't be assumed that someone inactive is engaging in this activity. Over reporting this will result in a sanction for the unnecessary reports if there isn't solid proof of this behaviour.<br><br>The other type of inactivity that can be reported is surrender or giving up. For example, a player has had a disagreement on the ship and stops playing. This is not allowed, ships must be played out.<br><br><br>Ships filling slowly, and Neutral Play<br>There will be the rare times ships might take longer to fill, when this happens we will expect "neutral play". Which means, we don't do anything that specifically will help either team. As an example, killing hunters is acceptable as a mush goal can potentially be to live longer as much as it is a human goal. What's not acceptable is holding the wrench, apron, weapons and other critical items prior to Mush selection; and you may be sanctioned if found doing so. These items may be moved, but not kept in your inventory. We consider holding onto items in order to have an advantage after Mush selection as a violation of Neutral Play.<br><br>The main point of Neutral Play is to give neither side a distinct advantage at the moment of Mush selection. If you have both blasters, and you are selected as Mush, it gives you and your team a significant advantage. The same can be said if you are selected as human. A griefer could pick up critical items before Mush selection, then hold onto them; this gives them a personal advantage, but more importantly, you'll probably have to kill them in order to get those items back. It is better (at the very least, it makes for a more interesting game) for neither side to have a distinct advantage after Mush selection, and that is why these Neutral Play rules exist.<br><br>Note: Neutral research before Mush selection IS allowed. Neutral research examples include - Ultra-healing Pomade or the NCC Lenses. <br><br>It is at the discretion of judges in this matter, if they feel the game has been spoiled for humans or Mush, they will give a sanction.<br><br>Mush Tests updated Jan 29/14<br>While Mush tests are allowed it is not just to kill someone who refuses to take one. The player might not have AP, might not want to be sick if the test would make them so or the player might just not want to partake in the test because they don't like them. Refusing to do the test alone is not a valid reason to kill someone. If this is the only evidence you have that someone is Mush, it's not enough and could be seen as an unjustified killing which will net a sanction.<br><br>Communicate, Communicate, Communicate!<br>This isn't a rule, per se, but it's crucial to the success of any ship. As simple as it sounds, following this bit of advice is something that may keep you alive longer. As a social game, other players are dependent upon you for information. People who wander around and don't communicate are often the first to be suspected of being Mush. Note that they're usually the first to be assassinated. Communicate more, and you have an easier time earning the trust of your shipmates...and trusted people are less likely to be killed over a misunderstanding!<br><br>Remember, Mush is a teamwork game! You can't actively work against your team be it mush or human! If you play as a human and you sabotage the humans (killing for no reason relate to the advancement of the human cause, taking both showers apart, cooking all the rations and letting them spoil, etc) this is griefing and it will be taken very seriously. If you are mush, you cannot denounce your fellow mush or impede the mush cause, you must work as a team.<br><br>Have fun! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Mush mods. <span class="tid_user tid_user_516 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="516">Peanutz</span>, <span class="tid_user tid_user_7950824 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7950824">Impet</span> and <span class="tid_user tid_user_1721761 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1721761">spacekadt</span><br><span class="tid_wspoil">in fond memory, <span class="tid_user tid_user_112128 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="112128">Annette</span> and <span class="tid_user tid_user_6826491 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="6826491">Spazticus$6826491</span></span></span></p>

All crew beed operations. Or is it another way to heal broken finger/nose/etc</cite><p>If the intention is to grief, yes, if not, usually not. It's a hard call. Ideally, talk to the player, ask them to stand up, maybe someone on the ship early can post a reminder about injuries, medlab, and needing the bed.</p><p>Few things to consider - no starting injury (that I know of) is lethal over time. Some are very annoying, but none <em>have</em> to be fixed immediately. Thus is can be possible to just wait a few cycles, then get it fixed. We may *want* to fix that injury RIGHT NOW, but it's not a real need.</p><p>Solid and wrestler can throw someone out of a room even before mush selection, thus it may be possible to clear the bed without needing cooperation, if really desired.</p>

                <p>Perhaps the safest way would be say, if there were four mush, and one of them <em>known</em> by the other mush to be a once a day player or something.</p><p>I'd make the plan without even involving that 4th rarely active mush, with the other three. All three of us already has the 'welcome back' spore ready; the anti-cure gets used on the offline uninformed dude, then the real cure (We are thinking like mush, right?) readministered in the middle of the 4th mush's inactive period, so for that player there was never even a second when they knew they were human (or even knew they were going to become human). That way the 4th mush is also completely in the cure, if ever reported. The judges would see the logs that they were not aware of what was going to happen, so there is 0% chance that they failed to play for the human team during that instant before they became mush again.</p><p>That is not to say that an informed 4th mush would be in trouble - but the area gets more and more gray the more information and power that targeted mush has to take action.</p>

                <p>well, theoretically as long as that person is a mush, the person can prepare everything to not be able to do anything when being a human. For example drop the walkie talkie in another room, being without any energy or mp at the time the cure shoudl happen. <br>And at that time of the curing the mushes are very quickly spiking him, before a real human is coming and able to check the skills, so even with whispering the humans can't be informed.</p>

                <p>It's one of the oversights by the guy who did the web development for the english site. I don't think it'll ever get fixed. As a workaround you can put a link to your 'My Account', 'Forum', etc. on the Twinoid shortcut bar ( <a href="http://twinoid.com/user/customizeBar" target="_blank">http://twinoid.com/user/customizeBar</a> ) and click those instead.</p>

Well it is!<br>If the person is rather inactive and probably no help as mush and your plan seems sneaky enough, it is a good strategy.<br>If you are killing a very active potential mush fellow with it and you aren't very good in making the humans to believe that you killed the last mush it is more playing against your team and a bad strategy.<br>So all in all it is valid (unless it is obvious to humans you converted the person before killing them).

                <p>I think that problem is rather a question of:<br>"Is it wise to turn a person and kill that person afterwards?"<br>Especially when it is an active person, it is mostly not wise. so much effort to get that person, so much potential, loosing of fun while trying to plan schemes with the potential fellow, always making someone feel a bit bad (at least I always don't like to get killed )... common sense would tell you in <strong>most cases</strong> that it is not a good idea to to convert and kill an active person.<br>But you can't always put an absolute statement here.<br>For example if you are on a ship with only active ppl (or inactive ones died quickly), if you want to get an infiltration an active mush <strong>needs</strong> to die somehow.<br>In many cases it might be better to discuss it with the mush first, so the mush can do a rampage, sabotage, whatever before getting killed.<br>Converting and active person and killing the person afterwards is <strong>very difficult to pull off</strong> so it is furthering the mush cause, that is the problem. Infecting an active person is difficult, having a reason to kill a that active person (why do you suddenly think the person is mush???) is an even bigger problem-if I see someone killing a mush without understanding it how he get to that knowledge, I would kill the killer too...<br>And not being able to use the knowledge/connections of the active person or rather wasting them, is that really worth it? Well, sometimes it might be worth it, only in very few cases...<br>I think ppl are rather thinking about that tactic who don't trust their fellows very much and are very interested to not die themselves/sacrifice themselves.</p>

When your partner doesn't listen to your warnings - you can kill the Mush.<br><em>It happened to me 13 of 16 times as Alpha Mush to get such partner, however, I haven't killed them, but could...</em></p><p>But remember, that killing Mush partner must aim to gain more trust and make crew not suspect you.</p>

                <p>The flaw of this method is that humans <strong>can't</strong> return to Sol (or even go to Eden) before two mushes are dead. Doing so would be basically surrender, because then they know they have mush on board and returning to Sol means they are deliberately losing a game.</p><p>So this method has some sense only in situations when your partner alone (you're trying to pass for human so you'll have probably no way to help him, remember) will be able to infect some other character so you can take anonymush.<br>This is by no means foolproof plan. Active human Eleesha can check for the printability of The List, someone can get lucky and notice that there are three mushes at the moment between infection and taking of anonymush and you can still be outed by things like not getting jumpkin head when eating one or not eating any at all, although you're for some reason expected to do so and wouldn't have reason to not eat one as a human.</p><p>Playing as a human is much better used in preparation of some mushy plan like rampage at suitable moment, Pilgred rush and hacking of command or something like that. And those plans can be stopped by active human at the right (or rather wrong) moment.</p>

You as a Mush can initiate the Sol return, of course, but a human can't. For the human team, it is sanctionable to return when you are 100% positive that there are living Mush on the crew bar, or when you know that Eleesha still has the option to print the List. Any human who initiates a return like this knowingly, should definitely be reported. We treat returning like this as a Harmful Return, because the human team hasn't satisfied the basic conditions for victory (returning without any Mush aboard.)</p><p>Note that if Eleesha is no longer alive, or has already printed the List, and any remaining Mush are Anonymush, it probably does NOT count as a Harmful Return for the humans.</p>

I just used wrong words apparently.</cite><p>Then you're just hoping that the other 13 non-mush people won't all get ill, won't be forced by circumstances to foodtest or eat jumpkin or won't die before the inevitable destruction. That can look easy on half inactive random ship, but on anything more active that's actually quite hard to pull off. People will count when you should starve, count your APs, telling you to eat or propose to bring you food when you say you're out of APs and then checking if you were able to do additional work. Especially when the ship starts to fall apart and everyone will be expected to the maximum for survival.<br>All this is avoidable and in the end there's a chance for victory, but it's by no means "guaranteed win".</p>

One casting ship, we used it as a test and went through almost all the crew (luckily we had a medic aboard). Without a medic, if you are wrong, then you consign your ship to failure as injuries are a right pain to fix by self-surgery (maybe a day's worth of actual ap or more to heal, and if you have multiple walking wounded requiring medlab bed...) The natamy rifle is best used to kill a mush. I suppose if you are 100% it is either A or B, but cannot decide which one it is, then maybe, I guess.</p>

Before surgery is performed, anyone can use the Medikit and you'll get proven human, proven Mush, or inconclusive. Someone with Medic on a ship without Ultra-Healing Pomade or anyone without Medic on a ship with Ultra-Healing Pomade can eliminate the inconclusive possibility. That said, the Natamy Rifle should only be used with the intent to kill, but you might be able to save someone if you happen to get enough evidence your target is human.</p>

                <p>They won't get to inactive status even at max AP/MP if they log on every cycle. Usually when an inactive wakes up, but doesn't do anything with their full AP they are either an XP farmer or a mush playing inactive. A legitimate player who can only be online for a short time would try to spend their AP on something helpful, while players that have quit the game wouldn't log on at all. Its also a risk to leave an inactive Jin Su on a ship with mush still on it, he's a great transfer target.</p>

But your motivations are what matter. If you're taking something that you're well aware isn't useful or optimal then you're opening yourself up for a sanction. If you think you're doing what's best for the ship, you're probably fine.</p>

                <p>I can't imagine any judge or mod deciding that something you buy with real actual money is anything other than a personal item. If you buy food from the vending machine and want to hold on to it, you're fine.</p><p>However, the only way to *prove* yourself that way is to have a full inventory when buying it so it knocks over into the room. Otherwise, there's no way to prove you didn't buy it before selection or get someone to give you theirs to drop or something. Since I generally hate proofs, if I'm buying vending machine food, I'll do it with room in my inventory so I don't knock it over.</p>

                <p>Personally I say knowingly keeping others off of surgery bed before mush selection when they can be dealt with. Should probably be considered Mush activity before selection(and ergo violation of neutral play), as it hurts the entire crew, and almost nothing can be done about it. What do you guys think?</p>

                <p>Why almost nothing can be done about it?</p><p>If you have enough ap and are not very unlucky you shoudl be able to heal the injury and leave medlab afterwards. And if someone is hogging it and going offline, you or someone else may kick the person out of the bed, some ppl may even be able to kick the person out of the room.<br>I don't think that in most cases the people hogging the bed are doing it knowingly just to prevent other people using it for surgeries- the Raluca probably thought: "Nice a bed for me alone, I can't sleep in a dorm anyway, so I will get aps here.", they are probably rather new players or don't pay much attention.<br> If you still have the impression, that someone is hogging the medlab bed intentionally so oher people can't heal themselves you may report it I would say.</p><p>side note: if everyone is healing himself before selection I am wondering why MT did that feature in first case, it is only an ap sink before mush selection then, but doesn't influence the mush chances then.</p>

Therefore simply pushing someone off to do surgery is impossible during neutral play. And these arguments over blocked medlab beds and injuries always happen at the beginning of the game. You don't expect someone with a broken rib or smashed foot to walk down to a dorm to wait for neutral play to end, right?</p><p>Wrestler/Solid are a solution as kick out works anyway but that's already been mentioned.</p>

                <p>Well you waste time and AP by waiting. Things don't get done. It's basically ruining those cycles for those having to stand there just because one single person isn't willing to accept that mush is a social not single-player game. Just imagine all your pilots have injuries that either make actions more expensive or lower their accuracy... then add the time some ships need to fill these days. What does a hull look like after 5-7 cycles with the starting hunters?</p><p>If you'd make me sit there with a bothersome injury waiting for neutral play to end I would probably 'kick' you off with the knife or a blaster as soon as I could.</p>

                <p>Sort of related to this, but at what point should we be reporting players for breaking neutral play? For example, I've noticed a lot of players making themselves dirty before mush selection. There are legitimate reasons (dismantling, self-surgery, etc) but what if they refuse to shower until the ship fills? What if they won't say how they were dirty? Also, what about people who take up beds in the dorms and lie down for 6-7 cycles?</p>

Most crews won't do it, but it's not an explicit violation of Neutral play. Usually people prefer to save their AP for the direct anti-Mush research, but the reason I believe it doesn't require the Mush Sample is even simpler than that: If the ship is very slow to fill, the crew might want to start expos - and they'd need to know if they've been spored by a Mush Trap.<cite>Can you install cameras in storages or dismantle the shower in Bravo Dorm?</cite>You can, and that is NOT a violation of Neutral Play. That is not to say that your crew will accept it, and they may put more suspicion on you...or be more likely to kill you for it. It is suspicious behavior, after all. Taking and <strong>holding</strong> onto them could be considered a Neutral Play violation, because you're denying <strong>anyone else</strong> the opportunity to place them. (Unless you're Gioele with his two Paranoid cameras. That particular case is a a <em>bit</em> more understandable, since the three cameras the ship starts with are still presumably available.)</p>

                <p>Chun is not god. The fact that <a target="_self" href="/tid/forum#!view/104909|thread/46180760">many experienced players tend to avoid her</a> leaves her more open to players of certain ... sketchyness</p><p>Over the 59 random ships I've played, I can recall 4 distinct Chuns who were similar to the one you mentioned : legitimately trying to play the game at first (not full-on 'MURICA griefer); but emotionally immature and egocentric, which leads her to end up doing more damage to the ship than good, sometimes unintentionally though bad decisions but also sometimes because she lost her temper and decided to go stabbing. This is all the while causing massive amounts of friction with the crew</p><p>In one case I led the crew to kill Chun (post-mush hunt, of course). She had done a laundry list of little things that messed up our game. It was so bad that we had to abandon the original hunt channel to exclude her and create a new anti-mush channel, which amusingly evolved into an anti-Chun channel. We put up with her during the hunt but after that was over, we had a long debate and vote. Although she had not acted with malicious intent (yet), we felt that her idea of what it meant to be on the human team was so wrong, we were much better off without her</p><p>As far as I know, no one other than possibly Chun got SDF points related to the incident, although I admit I was terrified to the point of composing a massive wall of text to post to the inbox just in case<cite></cite>Moral of the story : Chun is just another player. She may not be mush, but she can be incompetent, she can be a griefer, she can be a twelve year old. Use your judgement.</p>

                <p>No. Whenever or not someone is guilty is not for us to judge. We're supposed to report those we believe to be breaking the rules so those handling these reports who are capable of checking what really happened can do the judging. That is how I understand it. And Aceb, what you've been saying so far sounds as if we're supposed to put Chun above any doubt simply because we can't know what's going on behind the scene. But it doesn't matter what is going on behind the scene:<br>If someone, anyone, Chun or not kills someone they ought to be able to state a reason for that deed. A mush of course has no reason to say "oh hey yeah I killed that dude 'cuz I'm mush" but if you assassinate someone because you think you found your mush in him. Or because they are a danger to the ship. You ought to have a reason and be able to explain your actions. Else the dead person might never understand what made them look so suspicious for you to mistake them as mush and the rest of the living crew will have to view you as a lose canon or griefer <em>and act accordingly</em>.</p>

Mistakes can be made, for sure...but the SDF has the job of going through these reports to determine whether enough evidence to justify that killing exists. We'd rather you report a possible rule break, and we clear the accused, than to <em>not</em> have a report against someone, and they keep breaking the rules from game to game.</p>

                <p>When I was 13 (a long time ago when computer games were loaded from cassette), I was really into Hammer Horror films. I had a television (black and white) in my room to watch them on a weekend night (R.I.P. Christopher Lee, such a talented man and not just for acting)</p><p>As for the 13+ on Mush I've only just noticed that! (Although I suppose it makes sense with DTT... not something I've broached with my son, but I have signed consent forms for education in school, oh, and he does find some of the coprolalia changes rather funny). Although I did know it was there for d2n, and made a parental judgement call for him to play it. However, maybe not necessarily for the content of the game, a concern I had was the language the other players use. OK, I do swear myself, even occasionally within earshot of my son, but when it is in game, I see no point in swearing via the keyboard. I can $*£@? or just F!... instead. <br>One MMORPG I used to play, I wouldn't let my son anywhere near.. There was a 13 age limit, although younger players did sneak in. There was a bad-language filter so came out as <strong></strong>**, but misspellings bypassed that and eventually, the filters were taken away. I haven't played that game since before the watchmen came out on d2n, but I still get junk/phishing emails wanting my account details for the MMORPG.<br><br>I'm actually glad I can make parental choice here, and I am glad there are moderators around, even to protect the adults as well as children from naughty players. For the Impire!</p>

                <p>Even back then, the most anyone "knew" was that I was spent an obscene amount of time on computers. My folks are the sort that couldn't get a computer to work and don't know much beyond that games exist on the internet and that people play them. Not knowing the language didn't help. I don't think I could even explain what I was doing even if I tried</p><p>I think the 13+ in d2n was put there since MT didn't want to be liable for what people might post. Nothing dangerous in the actual game. 13 is the standard for social/multiplayer games and there's not much swearing and such in intelligent games like Mush or D2N compared to your average button masher-type</p>

If you did something during defacer there is no way that you wouldn't get the status "recently" when someone is online shortly afterwards. <br>Of course there are ways to get around activity checkings when you want pretend to be inactive or something like that.<br>Well, at least in the situation Patryk described the human has to be a very active player to use it for getting knowledge.</p>

Unless you're planning on being inactive or use that book for griefing or generally waste its potential (like reading pilot book when you're playing Paola, who needs to use all her APs for comms), I don't see any rules broken by reading a book by unconfirmed human.</p><p>Of course, another thing is not creating negative atmosphere by this action. It's good to discuss this beforehand, try to politely state your reasons for book being read by you and gain some support for that among the rest of the crewmembers.</p>

                <p>I know I have seen this answer before on the forums, but after about half an hour and many searches later, I still can't find it. So please forgive me asking again.</p><p>Re: Mush sleepers. Can a beta mush play exactly like a human (never spore, never infect/sabotage/break anything, etc) in order to help the crew reach Eden?</p><p>I'll list some proposed examples:</p><p>1. A beta that initially behaves mushy. After the Alphas are killed and he's not caught, goes to 'sleep' and plays exactly like a human in all ways to reach Eden. <em>This one I think is actually probably allowed, but I list it so that we have a spectrum of behavior.</em></p><p>2. The second example is a beta that never got a chance to behave mushy (maybe they intended to, but the alphas died before they logged in, etc.) They then do the same - go to sleep.</p><p>3. A beta that makes this the strategy from the get go after taking anonymush and successfully evading detection.</p><p>I'm pretty sure 3 is not allowed, but am unsure about 2, and (as I said) I think #1 is allowed, as at human crew at least had a reasonable chance to prevent the Eden infection.</p>

                <p>A beta mush trying to stay sneakily is always allowed if that is the intention of the mush team. <br>If the beta mush is just fully ignore them and not even speak with his alpha partners about the plan though the alphas actually need his help for another conversion, then that may be sanctioned-depending on circumstances and dependent on case to case.<br>But a mush infiltration is a legitimate mush strategy. Depending on the crew and activity it may even be rather difficult. <br>With a very active crew it is really hard to even accomplish that single beta mush without any noticing.</p>

                <p><cite>Re: Mush sleepers. Can a beta mush play exactly like a human (never spore, never infect/sabotage/break anything, etc) in order to help the crew reach Eden?</cite><br>You can, if using this strategy gives you reasonable chance to get to Sol/Eden undetected in any of cases you stated.</p><p>You cannot do it on ships, when this strategy will get you killed. If you get cured instead of killed, it's much worse fail btw. In these conditions trying to play as human can even earn you a report for surrendering:</p><p>- If humans are <strong>sure</strong> that there are mushes (Eleesha is active human with Tracker or logs of your convertion are visiable in modem)</p><p>- If humans <strong>suspect</strong> there are still mushes (alphas converted you using defractor in dorm duing day change, humans are not sure who exactly is beta, but think it's very likely one was made) <strong>and</strong> they have no emergecy to rush PILGRED (if humans suspect that there is a mush, but have no pilots and 30 hunters are following, maybe they'll have to rush PILGRED anyway - but it's unlikely for Eden ship)</p><p>P.s. A lot of players nowadays think, that doing nothing mushy is unbeatable, even for alpha-msuhes. They are very wrong. It's valid strategy only in some circumstance, that you/other mushes should create for you first. So it's no point to forbid it.</p>

                <p>I think you're still little bit off. Kyubey's examples, as I see them, are not so much about "what is or is not sanctionable" as about "what is or is not smart" (as Kobb very well pointed out in your other thread about this topic).</p><p>As a judge, I'd have pretty hard time to suggest a sanction for a reported player who just tried to play a stealth game by not infecting and not sabotaging. Unless he has openly denounced himself or directly stated to his partner(s) that he's not going to work with them as a mush, there's always possibility they were waiting for a good opportunity to strike and that opportunity just didn't come before they got uncovered. I was in this situation several times myself, so I can just sympathize with that.</p>

The two main ways you can get sanctioned as a Mush is either you purposely sabotage your own team (e.g. out yourself, out your partners, etc.) or you give up without trying (e.g. you punch someone a couple of times expecting to get killed right after Mush selection). Any attempt to defeat the humans, passively or actively, is generally allowed.</p>

                <p>How to report the whole ship? Thats not an abusive kind of report or something out of emotions.<br>Well, all is made out of emotions... but thats another thing.</p><br><p>As you can see on my picture <a href="http://i.imgur.com/PiJitwc.png?1" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/PiJitwc.png?1</a> there are many of inactives... all seems Im the only active crew member. All of them joined with a one hour gap between each of them. Noone said anything and no one did anything. I didnt check their skills but it wont surprise me if they are all lv 1 chars to grief/destroy this game. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now my question is: Have I report every single of them by clicking on their char in the report screen or can I just add the names of them in one report?</p><p>Ill wait a little more before I really start to report. Only hope. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Bringer plz report everyone (You can copy past your message regarding them, so I guess it won't take too long...) and contact the mush moderators afterwards , maybe they can help you even during this ship, so you aren't stuck there too long (<br><a href="http://twinoid.com/tid/groupDiscuss" target="_blank">http://twinoid.com/tid/groupDiscuss</a> and select mush moderators) or look at first page of this thread to see who are moderators.</p>

                <p>There's a couple of reporting-related things I need advice on for my current ship</p><p>First off, we killed one Alpha rather early, about 8 cycles after selection (although we found her out in exactly one cycle anyway). Following this incident, the second Alpha, whom we don't have any solid suspicion against, had a tantrum, confessed he was mush and took off in the Pasiphie without any items or plan. A lot of the crew reported this as surrender</p><p>We talked to him a bit, perhaps not so nicely, and he eventually landed with the expectation to be killed and moved to a storage room, even mentioning "wasting gold days". Instead, we trapped and cured him. He became immediately inactive. Even after we cured him, he logged in once, triggering the title reassignment and rude awakening message but made no move or actions upon logging in and became inactive in another 8 cycles. It's been many days since he was cured now, XP farming</p><p>The text is as follows :<br><span class="tid_sideNote"><strong>Janice : </strong>Stop that, chao...<br><strong>Kuan Ti : </strong>First shroom is dead. Good job everyone <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Fantastic! What gave her away? <br><strong>Ian : </strong>I could tell you, but then Chao would have to kill you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/sifflote.gif" alt=":-&quot;" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Fair enough, then. <br><strong>Kuan Ti : </strong>Who got the mission, by the way? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Bah. Janice got them. <br><strong>Raluca : </strong>btw sorry for offtopic but anyone here has a active casting? i miss active ships so much...am only in 2 inactive castings at the moment <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>((Try out Schrodingers Army, Raluca. They're pretty active.)) <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Also, I might as well reveal our grand master plan, now that Janice went and blew it apart. We were waiting until day change to spike a certain crew member and convert them, but then Janice decided a better idea would be to grab the disk from the bridge or lab, then hide it.. FML. <br><strong>Ian : </strong>Seriously Jin Su, would it kill you to play properly? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"><br>Instead of hijacking the pasiphae, you could have converted people or even kill key crewmembers. Explain to me how taking the pasiphae is supposed to help your team. Your goal is to infiltrate return or prevent return altogether. This doesn't help you; this doesn't help us. All this does is turn our game into a shitty one while you are still guaranteed to lose. Just because things are not going your way does not mean the best course of action is to do random damage that hurts you more than it hurts us <br><strong>Ian : </strong>As for Janice, I caught her melting in the shower on D2C8. We were keeping her around because we wanted to cure. Chao really kicked her simply because I wanted my bed back. So in reality, Janice didn't "blow anything apart" <br><strong>Finola : </strong>Mush revealing himself - pathetic. So THIS is what Shrodinger Army is about? Raluca - don't go there <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Pathetic <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>Ian : </strong>^ Easy for you to say. In MS and TE both without rejection means you never had to worry about that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Finola : </strong>Ok. You have a point here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I am in MS and TE and in both welcomed. BUT! I worked for that! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I worked for that by NOT playing cheap for example <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But... Isn't there anything else than SA? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>Ian : </strong>My problem with Parshipae hijack is not that it's cheap, but rather the fact that it hurts your own (mush) team while not helping you meet your goals at all. Yet people are still bent on doing it because it's so metafied <br><strong>Finola : </strong>No matter how will You look at this - it is simply bad Mushplay <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Both - cheap and not allowing Mush to win <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Hey, I could have easily set fire to the place /and/ took the extinguishers. We were planning on converting someone, and even got halfway there. Janice just bailed on the plan and got herself exposed, and ruined the plan. <br><strong>Ian : </strong>I have Firefighter skill unlocked. That skill allows one to put out fires without extinguishers. If I'm not playing Ian, I always hide or safekeep an extinguisher or BP <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Yeah. I don't appreciate being called crap straight from the get go, though. I had a plan, I was going to stick to it, and then my partner messes it up. I admit hopping in the pasiphae is cheap, but I could have done a lot worse than this.<br><strong>Ian : </strong>"Doing a lot worse" is supposed to be your job, you know. If you're trying to say we're supposed to be thankful for your mercy of "just" taking the pasiphae, you're missing the point of both pasiphae hijacking and the game <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Fine. let's get this over so we don't waste any more gold days then, eh?</span></p><p>My question first is, what parts of this is against SDF rules? I assume the confessing and XP farming is against the rules but I'm not sure if landing the ship into almost certain death is a form of playing against the team as well.</p><p>In addition, since most of the crew already reported him for confessing, we can no longer report him again for becoming inactive in the days following. (SDF only gets the first message sent from each person, about each other person). What should I do in such a situation where I need to report someone twice for two different things, or updating the same report?</p>

When you report someone, the judges will look at everything the reported person did (and any relevant actions by other players). If the judges find that the person reported broke more rules than was reported, the judges will rule for all rules broken, not just the ones reported. Having said that, if you feel you need to update a report, one idea to try is to ask someone who hasn't reported the reported person yet to report any new information.</p><p>To go back to your first question, here's a list of rules possibly broken based on what you posted:</p><ul><li>Mush admitting not causing the most damage to the humans</li><li>(Attempted) Pathetic suicide</li><li>Anti-mush play</li><li>XP farming</li><li>Hurting the human team as a human</li></ul>

                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there any rule about rampaging right after mush have been selected? In my last public voyage we only had one mush selected at the start. Instead of playing it out the mush rampaged (Set fires and dismantled fire extinguishers) and essentially threw a tantrum about how it’s pointless to play with only one mush at the start.</p>

But I'd get a conversation going with crewmates to discuss his death. Assuming there's an active mush hunt (otherwise, dirty really doesn't matter for a pilot), he's either mush or he's impeding the hunt. It's suspicious enough that you'd be within your rights to take him out.</p>

Having said that, if this pilot is showing signs of Mush behaviour, you have every right to kill him. However, the pilot has not broken any rules from what you've said.</p>

Being dirty might lead to be proof but if you're 80% sure he is human and you're in favor to kill him, that's not a justified kill, imho. Remember that pilots don't take apron and are one of those who might get dirty if they eat. Sometimes pilots might have time to wash, sometimes not.</p>

                <p>Right, I understand the benefits of those strategies. I'm just saying that in general, the Mush shouldn't have to push the humans to kill a patsy. Just convert the player, and let that player help the Mush team. Maybe the Mush team can tell the beta that the humans plan to kill him soon, so rampage. Now, if you're afraid the guy's a griefer or might hurt the Mush team, you can try to push the humans to kill him. Win-win for everyone except the griefer.</p><p>The main scenario the SDF wants to avoid is one Mush trying to throw another Mush under the bus in a way that hurts the Mush team. For example, two alphas make a beta. One alpha argues with the beta. The three of them could work together to help the Mush win, but instead the alpha denounces the beta for personal gain. With the added factor of killing the beta immediately after conversion, one could argue it would be just as if a bad human was killed with the added benefit it looks like an alpha Mush was killed, and if it's a Mush that did the killing, the Mush might gain some trust from the humans.</p>

Mush have <strong>no</strong> way to gain or lose morale, by any means. Even though they may see the morale messages, their morale value can't change. If you transfer into someone with zero morale, you're guaranteed to be dead the following cycle. If you Transfer into them while they have one or more morale, then your value will read as 14 (16 if Gold.)</p>

                <p>so i had a ship where i was casually playing jin su being nice and human, now what happened was a random janice who i figured to be mush (she turned out to be human).<br>now what happened was i didnt do anything mushy in the whole game besides sleeping in the shower dorm i never got dirty but the janice told the crew that i was dirty entering the dorm and she caught me before showering. so yeah i ended up getting killed for that didnt make a fuss out of it as i was assuming janice would be mush but she turned out to be human.</p><p>now i dont really see why a human would lie to get another human killed (i dont actually think she was a griefer as she was a high level gold player), it could have been a old vendetta or something i guess.</p><p>now to the question: can i still report her after the ship has ended (last words confirmed and what not).</p>

                <p>No, you unfortunately can't.<br>Checking her last words she seemed to be convinced that you were mush and is excusing herself, strange. Maybe she made that up to have a legitimate reason to kill you and thought it would not matter since she would kill a mush (hopefull that's a lesson for her). Really not ok what she did in that case.</p><p>Well,at leats you slept in shower dorm and could have sneakily showered all the time of course what may have make you high on her suspect list. So another possible explanation is that maybe she also just thought seeing you dirty when you entered, sometimes people see what they just wish to see and everything was just an imagination / mistake.</p>

                <p>It's difficult to realize what happened in the background. What kind of evidence they picked up, whether valid or not, and who they were talking to. It's surprising how easy it is to convince people that someone is suspicious as a mush. I've done it many times which have led to humans killing humans.</p><p>If you weren't dirty and she said you were then there's something not adding up, though. Also simply walking into the shower dorm isn't necessarily reason to immediately kill someone. You should try to state when you're dirty immediately after you get dirty to avoid people screaming at you as active ships will watch the shower dorm close.</p><p>In the future, if you think there was foul play, you should report it. If Janice would have turned out to be mush then she would've been cleared but she wasn't. Without the report, though, there isn't much anyone can do about it. We can see their name after the fact but the evidence is all lost as we can't bring up anything regarding the ship or the actions/dialogue that took place.</p>

                <p>If there were no report to make to judge any person, then many innocents may get sanctioned. Also we can't even be sure whether egin understood everything right what janice someweher said, maybe she just said he had chance to extract spores since staying in BD, it is not fine to blame a player in public anyway and I would really encourage to try solving the mystery via pm, this all sounds fishy to me and noone killed Janice afterwards, so I wonder whether she really said catching him dirty and sneaky showering, egin was also not in mush hunt channel I guess, which would have been a hint he may have been suspected. <br>If anyone thinks there is a chance that a rule was broken, then report.

If you're Mush after selection then you may hide them or use them to kill someone. If they're on the floor, everyone has a chance to do something with them after selection. You may say "If I'm Mush I will drop them" but not everyone (in fact barely anyone) has that frame of mind. Also hoarding weapons is sometimes a sign that that person might be a griefer. The knife is the most dangerous weapon (barring wrestler) in the game and the armor makes it that much more difficult for someone to be killed so I wouldn't necessarily call them unimportant, they're just important in another sense.</p>

                <p>Your crew is correct, and Badblanket is correct. Items may be moved, but may not not <strong>kept in your inventory</strong> prior to selection. Let's say it's not the weapons, but the apron. If Chun is holding that apron before selection, and she then goes inactive for a day, the early game research is <em>significantly</em> hindered by that act. This is part of the reason that not even Chun is exempt from the Neutral Play rules. We enforce the rule in order to give neither team an unfair advantage at the moment of selection.</p><p>Any time you're forced to kill a player as a last resort to get them to drop critical items (and it happens more often than you'd think) it costs the crew AP, morale, and a potentially active player. If people aren't holding items prior to selection, the chance of such "murders of necessity" drops significantly.</p>

                <p>Eh it's sort of a rampage type tactic. Although I'd suggest you either get rid of the large bay upgrade first. Also anything that can damage you like steelplates or electrical spikes can do you damage potentially harming this tactic. Honestly there are probably better strategies, but I have yet to see even whispers of banning it(besides in a casting or two).</p>

It's a pretty looked down on tactic, though, just like taking off with extinguishers and pyro. There is a bit of skill and luck involved in being able to turn two others who would be online fast enough for the group to fill up in IB, though. Chances are, 4 mush could decimate the crew quicker than the hunters would be able to, though. If a mush uses this tactic, consider it a fun little challenge to figure out a way to kill them while keeping the ship afloat because, if they wanted to, they could just leave IB and murder spree 80% of the ship. Two people, alone, (with the right skills) can decimate a ship.</p>

Humans need a place to camp out safely. Projects are always gain one, lose two. So where there's benefit there is also loss. As for research, normally the Mycoscan would be against the rules but this episode makes it so that people start with random spores. The early mycoscan helps to balance that (and I have yet to be on a ship that actually does mycoscan prior to selection, it's usually lenses).</p>

We had one project finished prior to mush selection. This is a bad thing for the mushes. Also, I often see some researches done prior to mush selection, such as the mycoscan : a big threat to the mush, since human can scan often to see if they got a spore!

Chun can't hold onto everything, so hiding is often a good solution. Telling her I hid the item somewhere, there are many chances she won't go search for it to hide it back (still possible, but the most of the time). Then, no team is disadvantaged. Also, if my co-mush want to go rampage, the weapons will be in our hands.</cite><br>Actually, human team is highly disadvantaged because Chun might be inactive (well your partner can be too...) and she doesn't have to know if you lie or not.

I think most of people might get away with this but if there's Gioele with coffee skill... Problems might begin.</p><p>&amp;edit: About mycoscan, I saw good mushes turning that research into their benefit of creating chaos, on top of that, most of people don't give a fifty cents about mycoscan after one scan, unless you start to spike someone's who is panicking and/or visits lab to check themselfs.<span class="tid_wspoil">Yes, I think people often after checking themselfs once, stop checking later, because (I ASSUME!) they consider being safe as mycoscan is avialable and mush might be too scared.</span></p>

                <p>The rules were established during beta, over two years ago. Short of having a time machine to go back and forcibly change our minds, the rules aren't likely to change in this timeline. Further, since the creator of Mush has left MT, it is even more unlikely that we will have any new circumstances to force a change in the rules.</p><p>This was long debated in the SDF, and the Neutral Play rules were set up to be fair to <strong>everyone.</strong> If no critical items are kept in the inventory of any player, then <em>everyone</em> has an equal chance to pick them up at the moment of Mush selection, regardless of whether they were first or last to wake up. This is why we ruled that they may be <strong>moved</strong>, but not <strong><em>kept</em></strong>. It is not justifiable to claim that you're "holding it for Chun", "keeping it safe", or "keeping it for yourself"; the rule forbids keeping those items.</p><p>Holding critical items was ruled to be <strong>effectively the same as hiding them</strong>, when items could be hidden prior to selection. While items can't be hidden prior to selection any longer, when people hold items in order to deny them to others...they are doing it in order to have an advantage. We are maintaining the rule to prevent that advantage from being gained. Chun is subject to this rule as well, so being Chun does not grant an exception, either.</p><p>Ultimately, there is no point in trying to get us to change the rule, regardless of whether you agree with it. The rule exists with good reason, and will continue to exist to provide as fair a start as possible for each player, regardless of their team.</p>

                <p>Well, I'm surprised to learn all this now, considering the number of ships I've done on that server and that I always do this when I have the chance to. Before, I was always hiding the grenade without taking it (so I hid it in the room it was at the beggining) and depending if I end up mush or human, I either tell my co-mush where it was, or I tell Chun. I never heard before yesterday that all this was forbidden (I know that now, it is not forbidden to hide thing prior to mush selection : it is impossible).</p><p>The only neutral play I've heard of was concerning the researches : no anti-mush research before mush designation. Now, that is taken care of by the fact the sample isn't in the ship at that point, so researches are impossible.</p>

                <p>I wanted to report XP-farming on my last ship... where I got killed from the guy who was probably farming, while I tried to kill him. The character was Gioele. No participation at all, just wandering from room to room and taking over beds. Online from time to time to avoid gettin inactive. He really didn't do anything except of keeping himself alive and wasting rations. He had 2 skills which lets me assume he knew what he was doing. Could you guys please investigate. That wasn't fun at all.</p>

If we allowed Chun to do things like hoard weapons before selection (to use a random possible example), it's still an unfair advantage for the human team. The goal is to have mush and humans have an *equal* chance at the moment the ship fills. Once that happens, it's a glorious free for all in seeing who's online and who can sneakily get to what first.</p>

                <p>The game has to be played out to its logical conclusion, because surrender is strictly forbidden - as is "co-operating" with the Mush on random ships. Any human in that instance is still required to resist, even if they are guaranteed to fail. It would be playing against their team to work with the Mush, and the Mush aren't allowed to make such an offer to the last human...to entice someone to play against their team would spoil the game. Similarly, being voluntarily converted would spoil the game.</p><p>Even as Ian, a human player can still fight back, without committing suicide. A rampage could do the trick, even if it fails, because the Mush team might opt to kill rather than wait to be killed. As long as the attempt to further the team's goals is made in earnest, it can hardly be called a suicide.</p>

                <p>The big advantage of confidant is that a player is not forced to reveal log, but can decide to confide or not.<br>If there are players who would spam examine just to hide eventually a food testing (theoretically it would also not be proven, you would have to check afterwards whether eating of both things happened really in same or following cycles), then they make themselves voluntarily suspicious, which may mislead the mush hunt and even if they don't get killed because mush hunters are careful, it may lead to the situation that mush hunters overlook the real mushes.<br>That being said, I am no friend of easy confirmations as well. But instead of just spamming examine and making himself voluntarily suspicious therefore (which probably can be seen in some way as playing against their team), the player can in most cases decide to just confide only after doing some other helpful things and therefore hiding possible confirmations unless he needs really urgently and immediately a morale boost. Or just avoid to double eat at all.</p>

It's not the choice, but <em>the attitude and reasoning behind that choice</em> that is sanctionable, in this case. Or, to put it another way, the player's willingness to make the game harder to win, at the expense of the rest of their team.</p><p>I have personally sanctioned players who have taken a suboptimal skill choice because, and I quote just one example, they "wanted to make the game more challenging." If they want to make the game more challenging, there are casting options they can play with, and that others consent to before they jump. A relatively new NOF-only Janice can still contribute to a ship. Maybe they're just trying out the skill for the first time, and don't know that some of the early skills are optimal for Bronze players. An experienced Janice player that is NOF-only, because they "wanted to make the game more challenging" has made that skill choice, with the intention of hurting their team's chances to win.</p><p>See how the difference in attitude brings forth our retribution?</p><p>A newbie may not know better, and may indeed think that higher level skills are inherently better - at least until someone experienced counters that line of thinking. <strong>Why</strong> they chose that skill matters.</p><p>Would we sanction a first time Roland player just for being Sprinter-only? Of course not, especially if that's the only thing for which they are being accused. A player who has survived a few dozen ships, and clearly knows better won't get the same leeway if they were to do the same.</p>

                <p>I think there are several degrees of seriousness :</p><p>- A beginner who picks a skill because they don't realize that it is "inferior". I recently had a newbie Chun who picked Nurse because she thought it was better for the crew, since it benefited everyone while MOH only benefited her. <strong>That is not reportable.</strong></p><p>- A player who picks a skill because they think that it is not inferior and /or is useful. Their crew members may or may not agree with the choice, but remember that there is a different between a bad player, someone who makes "bad" choices, and a griefer. I put "bad" between quotation marks because it is subjective. Very often, Jin Su is called a griefer if he picks Leader instead of Pilot, and on other ships he's considered a griefer if he picks Pilot, just because people have automatisms and preconceived ideas about "optimal" skills, instead of basing themselves on the situation on each different ship. Another example is Andie, with some players who think that they should always pick Polyvalent (the problem is that players should wait before choosing their skills, in order to choose the right skill for a particular ship ; but that is another problem, not discussed here). In my opinion, <strong>that is not reportable either</strong> if the chosen skill is useful for the crew and the absence of the rejected skill doesn't harm the ship.</p><p>- Slightly more serious, someone who picks a skill that, without being vital, would be more useful than the one they chose. That's the case we're discussing here. IT Expert is not useless, far from it, but Shrink is usually more important. You can, however, consider that choosing IT Expert is not a bad idea. There are several possible justifications : that ship has other morale sources (Confidant, Leader...), you prefer the advantages offered by IT Expert, you consider that a ship can survive easily without a shrink (after all, a shrink can be inactive or mush, or she can be killed, and it doesn't mean that the crew is doomed). If the player gives reasonable justifications and genuinely thinks that they choice is good for the crew, <strong>it is not reportable</strong>. Again, you may or may not agree with those justifications, but that doesn't mean that this player is a griefer (but if you have doubts, report and let the judges decide).</p><p>- Same situation, but without a single justification, or just "I chose it because I can, look, it's allowed". <strong>That is reportable.</strong></p><p>- Again, same situation but "I chose it because I don't want to make the game too easy". As Spaz explained, the player is aware that they are making things difficult for their side, and <strong>that's reportable.</strong></p><p>- Finally, those who pick a skill explicitly to harm the ship, and they're usually not going to stop there. Those are griefers who of course <strong>should be reported</strong>.</p><p>Let me stress one last thing : in most cases (except the last one, and maybe the one before), killing that player will not make the situation better. In fact, it can make it worse (waste of AP, loss of morale, loss of an active player) and can, in some situations, be reported too.</p>

Someone who may without explanation have picked a skillset the crew disagrees with but is otherwise as helpful as can be may be seen as someone who chose skill(s) without malice, and could be cleared of wrongdoing. However, someone who is clearly experienced and doesn't try to explain choosing a skillset that people with experience would know is not most useful to their team could be sanctioned. Even if the worst case scenario happens where someone who acted without malice gets sanctioned, they can appeal to the mods and try to justify to them.

                <p>A ship that loses the Icarus on its first planet will likely not have any shot at Eden, and its long term survival chances are greatly reduced. Even if the planet itself is safe enough to have a 0% chance of a solo expo resulting in death, the Mush might deem it worth the risk to deprive the ship of the Icarus early on. That kind of early loss may hinder the human team's morale.</p><p>Specific details aside, I agree with npfan here: Just because one player determines that a solo expo is worth the risk, does not give that player the freedom to act on that conclusion without any consequences. If the crew consents, that's different - and arguably better. Desperation may force immediate action to take place, even with the risk involved. <strong>Therein lies the major difference.</strong> A crew making that decision and taking that risk, is better than one person deciding it <em>on their own</em>, and proceeding <em>on their own</em> regardless of the consequences.</p>

                <p>When I wrote my original reply, it wasn't clear that Frieda went on the expedition alone, or that it was the starting planet. These are important details that would certainly change my opinion and raise my suspicion as a player. Such details make the action far more reckless than a calculated risk, in my opinion, but those not on the ship and not investigating any potential report won't have all the details available.</p>

                <p>So on a ship that ended recently, we didn't report a griefer (at least I don't think she was reported), because it was quite possible she was mush. Esentially, human killed Chun and stabbed a mush a few times immediately after mush selection. Mush then bled out from injuries. We thought the human was a mush who killed chun, stabbed a human a few times, then transferred to make us believe she wouldn't stab her transfer target, but after transferring found herself out of ap and about to bleed out shortly, because the victim was recently active and probably spent all his ap before laying down.</p><p>I hope that makes sense. Anyways, it wasn't clear until after confirming the last words that the human who killed Chun was never mush at all! Is there anything that can be done beyond hoping the mush victim filed a report himself?</p><p>If a human kills Chun, you guys should have a report automatically filed. Yes, Chun could be a griefer, but that's what the investigation is for.</p>

                <p>No, you have to report the player. Which is still doable on end screen usually, as long as you haven't left your last words. So if you are not sure the next time whether it was a griefer or a mush action, either check your ship's end page before leaving last words (possible when going to "My Account-My file" ) or report just in case, judges would clear the report if it were a mushes action.</p>

                <p>As far as I know: Yes. If the crew wants to go on, that'd be a harmful return. He's not allowed to shorten your journey or rip you of your chances to find Eden just so he doesn't get a Sold/Starvation/Fatal Depression/Injuries end. Personally I'd say if he really can't stick around any longer (real life does happen after all) he should go stand in a storage for you to sell him and let the next in line take over command. But I'm not sure if that wouldn't be some sort of suicide on his part... either way your hypothetical case sounds reportable.</p>

                <p>Regarding that matter one may add that the lenght of the ship plays an important role too:<br>Stopping to play D4 because of a vacation is report - and sanctionable. People tend to know things like that well in advance and 4 days is much shorter than the average ship.<br>However, stopping after 2 weeks or longer because of the same reason is within the rules. He couldn't expect the ship to last way longer than average and his crewmates willing to continue past that day.<br>No idea where the line exactly is (and it may even vary from case to case), but my rule of thumb is to be abled to play at least til day 10. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Joining a ship for say 1-2 days of gameplay and then going plain inactive spoils the others' game. However players shouldn't be sanctioned, because a ship lasted way longer than expected: The better random ships last up to 3 weeks and Noone should be expected to stop playing that long just for the unlikely possibility of an extraordinary long ship.</p><p>And as mentioned I don't know where the line would be drawn, but I'd advise to have at least 10 days to play(casting ticket Sol return). A week(from my estimate average ship lenght) would be somewhat borderline and anything shorter lacks overall decency. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Or whether those who do not wish to return to Sol have good reasons and are willing to do what it takes. I had a ship on which most of the crew wanted to survive as long as possible, but when it came to dealing with night emergencies, only two of us were awake every night. In the end, we had enough. This was against the wish of the majority, but that same majority wanted something at the expense of two persons. You cannot really sanction someone who doesn't want to exhaust themselves while the rest of the crew sleeps...</p>

                <p>So on my ship we have this guy who keeps acting against the ship even though we are confirmed mush free. He gagged people for no reason, forces us to stay in place as he sits in a patrol ship shooting at hunters, gets mad when we don't collect scrap (then he goes and repairs the hull without using the osciloscope), and just recently punched someone off the bed instead of taking the free ones, and called me a cunt when I told him to use the osciloscope. We've all told him several times to stop doing these things, but he keeps going at it. Is it reportable? He (kind of) seems like he has good intentions, but he doesn't listen to us half of the time</p>

We'd prefer if players try to defuse these sorts of situations themselves but we all know that there are those people who just wont listen.

So not only because they personally consider easy confirmation against the spirit of the game, but also because it may trigger more likely a rampage.</p>

                <p><strong>Regarding Mush Tests:</strong></p><p>Any player may <strong>ask</strong> another player to Mush test themselves, explicitly named as a test or not. "Mush test yourself, or we'll kill you." would <strong>not</strong> be considered asking, and could fall under sanctionable territory. As noted, you can't force anyone to test themselves.</p><p>On the other hand, asking them, "Would you be able to drink a coffee, eat a ration, and take care of these hunters this cycle?" is perfectly acceptable. Not only is it being asked in a way that helps the ship if it's done, but the player being asked can consume in a room not covered by a camera or occupied by another player...such as in the patrol ship. (While this means the humans may not have a log or two of the eating, it is still a way to comply with the request in a way that helps the ship, without explicitly testing oneself.)</p><p>To add to this, any player who is asked to test themselves has the right to refuse, regardless of whether they are human or Mush. Their refusal is explicitly allowed, because many players feel that Mush testing can spoil the game. You can't play against your team, though, so <strong>here's where a few more rules come into play.</strong> It's a fair argument, and so we have some ground rules to make sure this is fair to both sides:</p><p>1. Refusing a Mush test is not sufficient evidence to kill a player, <em>on its own.</em> The refusal is just a refusal, and if that is the <em>only</em> evidence that you have, it could be sanctioned if the player is killed. In short, if all you have is a refusal, you need more evidence before you murder them. You also can't report someone <em>just</em> for refusing a Mush test. Combined with more harmful behavior, perhaps - but not on its own.</p><p>2. If the human(s) asking already have sufficient evidence to suspect the player before the question is asked, they may kill the player, and this killing is generally not sanctionable. The key point here is that some players might act really suspicious, and asking them to Mush test is a last chance to justify keeping them alive. We check PM logs for discussions like that, and establish whether the killer(s) had just cause to suspect the victim.</p><p>The reason for the above rules is to give flexibility to Mush, as well as to humans that don't wish to risk being targets for conversion, or want to avoid triggering a rampage caused by "too many humans being confirmed".</p><p>3. It bears repeating, since the question comes up often enough: <strong>The Natamy Rifle may ONLY be used against other players for assassinations. Not "tests".</strong> It is <strong>NOT</strong> a tool for <em>testing</em> anyone, and using it with the intent to "test" a player can and will garner a guaranteed sanction, <em>even if the victim is a Mush.</em> If you see this behavior, please report it. If there's enough evidence to justify killing a player, then it is just the means to that end; if you shoot with it, you shoot to kill. The Natamy Rifle can inflict multiple injuries per hit, and the injuries from even one successful hit can cripple or even kill a human. Better be damned sure, if you intend to use it.</p><p><span class="tid_mod">If you have anyone on your ship that disputes these rules, or how they are handled, please point them to this post. If they want further clarification, they can send me a Twinoid PM.</span></p>

                <p>What if a player asks another player (i.e. me) to DTT for morale sake, and I refuse. Is that considered playing against human team, or does it fall under the realm of consent? If there are 3 players on a ship and 2 of one gender are about to die of morale loss, and the one of the other gender refuses, is that playing against the team? Maybe I'm not being clear here.</p><p><em>If the human player's only means of survival is DTT at that moment, and the only person available to do it with refuses, is that refusal sanctionable</em> ?</p>

                <p><em>Potentially</em>, yes; but it will of course vary from case to case. Motive is highly important here.</p><p>If there is clearly no threat of any Mush remaining, then the only reasons to justifiably refuse would be a lack of AP, or an even greater emergency requiring the player's attention. It would be rather selfish to refuse, and then go work on the Mad Kube, for example. (That would almost certainly get sanctioned, if reported.)</p><p>Granted, this is <strong>not</strong> a guarantee that any refusal would garner a sanction. Just bear in mind that a refusal <em>could</em> be seen as a case of, "you didn't kill them with your bare hands, but you left them to die". Would you accept a Shrink refusing to Comfort someone, knowing that the Shrink had AP to spare, and was the only morale source remaining? Probably not, I'd guess.</p>

Humanity is cursed with a happiness bar. One that decreased every day without it being the fault of the individual. A bar that only specific things can fill. You are saying you would much rather watch someone die (In a process that isn't their fault) rather than bite the bullet? Especially since the process takes half a second? In addition, you're part of a crew who have been sent to save all of humanity and you would jeopardize such for your morals?</p><p>There's a time to rp realistically and be a character with morals then there's a time where you have to balance it with the mechanics of the game. You can't hinder your ship on the basis of RP reasons.</p><p>If I understood correctly, I think you mentioned this being the fact that your real world morals prohibit you from having VERY fake relations in a video game? If I understood that correctly then I find it interesting that you have no issues with killing in a video game. =P The line is drawn when the lights go out!</p>

Even if those are your personal morals, and I'm not suggesting otherwise, what happens to your <em>character</em> is not what happens to <strong>you</strong>, personally. If that were the case, gamers would be the largest demographic of serial killers (and their victims) on the planet. There would be far fewer of us if that were the case.</p><p>You separate what your character does from what you personally might do. Ever kill another player, in any game? Mush is a PvP game, after all. If you morally refuse to kill any character, under any circumstances, then in a situation in which it's just you alone against one or more Mush, you'd surrender - which is explicitly against the rules. Refusing to kill anyone might make sense if you have doubts about whether the killing is justified, or if you're Ian. (Even I've made kills as Ian, in desperate circumstances.) But if there's a mutated Mush, and you outright <em>refuse</em> to help kill that Mush...well, let's just say that falls under playing against the team.</p><p>What you're suggesting is in many ways worse than surrendering; it's suggesting that if you're the only morale source left for another player, you'd <strong>let them die</strong> rather than try to maintain their morale. I can basically guarantee I'd sanction someone who gave that particular justification, and I would deny an appeal made on those grounds.</p><p>You are entitled to your morals. You are <strong>not</strong> entitled to play against your team due to those morals, nor are you entitled to avoid any negative consequences of said action.</p>

Let us put you into the universe of MUSH. Humanity is cursed with a happiness bar. One that decreased every day without it being the fault of the individual. A bar that only specific things can fill.

In addition, you're part of a crew who have been sent to save all of humanity and you would jeopardize such for your morals?</p><p>There's a time to rp realistically and be a character with morals then there's a time where you have to balance it with the mechanics of the game. You can't hinder your ship on the basis of RP reasons.</p><p>If I understood correctly, I think you mentioned this being the fact that your real world morals prohibit you from having VERY fake relations in a video game?

If that were the case, gamers would be the largest demographic of serial killers (and their victims) on the planet.

Mush is a PvP game, after all. If you morally refuse to kill any character, under any circumstances, then in a situation in which it's just you alone against one or more Mush, you'd surrender - which is explicitly against the rules. Refusing to kill anyone might make sense if you have doubts about whether the killing is justified, or if you're Ian. (Even I've made kills as Ian, in desperate circumstances.) But if there's a mutated Mush, and you outright <em>refuse</em> to help kill that Mush...well, let's just say that falls under playing against the team.</p><p>What you're suggesting is in many ways worse than surrendering; it's suggesting that if you're the only morale source left for another player, you'd <strong>let them die</strong> rather than try to maintain their morale. I can basically guarantee I'd sanction someone who gave that particular justification, and I would deny an appeal made on those grounds.</p><p>You are entitled to your morals. You are <strong>not</strong> entitled to play against your team due to those morals, nor are you entitled to avoid any negative consequences of said action.</p></cite><p>Well. I find this upsets me.

                <p>It is upsetting to me that you'd be willing to play against your team, to <strong>let another player die</strong>, because your moral code abhors the notion of even a fictional act.

However, if your morals cause you to break the rules of the game by playing against your team, then the SDF has a problem with that, and will act accordingly. It is not the fault of any other players that you have your own personal moral code, and it is not their responsibility to be subjected to it.</p><p>If all of this is a real serious problem for you, perhaps you are right, and this isn't the game for you.</p>

I didn't intend for this to become a battle of morals, only to find out if it would be sanctionable to follow them, but I do not like killing. I avoid it wherever possible. (In fact the only time I've ever killed is as Roland... weird.) And what situation might it come up that I would really be the only option for someone to be saved? Hasn't yet in my ships.

                <p>As I already stated, this is a PvP/survival game. You know that, because you can't possibly win as a human unless the Mush are eliminated. You know that for the humans, they will be forced to kill the Mush when found; you're saying YOU won't kill, so then we must imply that if you are the only player active to stop a rampage, you probably won't do it. We must further imply that you'd be accepting of others killing on your behalf, as long as YOU don't get your hands dirty. Killing by proxy is still killing.</p><p>As a Mush, you need to convert the humans to your side, kill them all, or infiltrate Sol/Eden. This would also run counter to your moral code, if you're selected as a Mush. I'll note that if you actively hinder your team as a Mush, that can also lead to a sanction. Refusing to kill humans could certainly count under that rule, if you're discovered and the team decides to rampage.</p><p>You also know that the situations on ships often become desperate, and as I already stated, allowing another player to die a preventable death strictly falls under playing against your team. <strong>If you are morally unwilling to do whatever it takes to keep your team surviving and advancing, you need to find another game to play.</strong></p>

I didn't intend for this to become a battle of morals, only to find out if it would be sanctionable to follow them, but I do not like killing. I avoid it wherever possible. (In fact the only time I've ever killed is as Roland... weird.) And what situation might it come up that I would really be the only option for someone to be saved? Hasn't yet in my ships. If it does, I will deal with it. But in the meanwhile, I will play.</cite><p>While I find this all hiliarious , to be honest i also have avoided DTT to this day, but that's just tradition for me. not because of morals.</p>

To me they both hurt the ship equally and the former is even more annoying because they are receiving xp for literally doing nothing.

                <p><cite>Because basically this is what's happening as far as i'm concerned.</cite> You're assuming too much. You do not know what these players think, what is happening in their life, how long they have been playing. So why would you decide that they can't be anything but xp farmers ?</p><p>The aim of the SDF is to punish those who harm the game deliberately, and just as in any justice system, you cannot punish someone without a proof that they are guilty. Now, as opposed to regular players, we have access to more information about crew members. Most reports for so-called "xp farming" are cleared for several possible reasons : most of the time, those players are beginners who tried the game but did not like it, people who had real life troubles or internet problems, or even people who were not inactive but were accused of inactivity. When there is proof of real xp farming, then the player can be punished, but that's a minority. Idle griefers, who jump only in order to be inactive, are punished too. But again, that's an exception.</p>

                <p>1) Some players aren't aware of the neutral play rule, so yes, it's better to ask them to drop stuff and explain why it's not right to hog items prior the selection. But you can just send the report as well and let judges decide. <br>There's no such thing as a defined amount of cycles after which holding items is concidered to be against the rules - technically, it is not allowed to hold them at all - only move. But then again - maybe a player is just new and didn't know/forgot to drop the object in question and will fix that next time he logs in to check the game.<br>I, personally, prefer asking first, unless the player is obviously experienced and the object they grab is weapons/armor/scooter.<br>2) You can't see how many reports have been sent against you or what they were, unless you got a sanction for them (the amount of points is displayed on the My account-&gt;My Settings page, alongside with info aboud gold days and such, if I'm not mistaken).</p>

If you see it done by a newbie, that will be cleared anyway, so don't bother to report it. Also you may wait out eventually, whether the player did it because of being mush.<br>And if there was no loss of a really important project it is probably also not worth to report.<br>A good example of when you should report it:<br>One mush stays with a critical item in Pasisphae, you work hard together to finish magnetic net, but someone finished a crap project instead though it was communicated with everyone how important that project is...</p><p>In other cases it may also depend how often/repeatedly the person is showing such behaviour on ship (will player always not listen to crew, working on wrong projects?)</p>

                <p>The short answer is that it comes down to intentions. If the person did it out of belief that they were working for the good of the ship, they'll be cleared. Even if it wasn't what the crew wanted. The SDF isn't here to enforce optimal play, we're here to enforce the rules as they're written, but by Motion Twin and the additional rules set forth by SDF. The player would only be sanctioned if it's clear that they were playing against their team.</p>

                <p>First of all, I'm not sure it was actually Kuan Ti who hacked the command terminal and returned the ship to Sol. This action leaves mark in character's history (something along the line "You took control of command terminal" ) and there isn't anything like that there. Also, his last words seem pretty upset about the return, too.</p><p>Generally, you can report the player after the ship ended in the same way as during the ship - just click on some relevant message in chat and choose report button - but only before you confirm your own last words. After that, it's no longer possible and you can just hope that someone else does it.</p>

After that, it's no longer possible and you can just hope that someone else does it.</cite><p>Yea, before confirming I was almost convinced that he was the Mush because our hunting was rather weak so I wasn't completely sure to file report.</p><p>You might be right, it seems that Commander Chao actually did it, in that case he might be the one I want to report. I was Terrence there and I definitely disagreed with going Sol, yet he did it without asking.</p>

If the time stamps indicate that Kuan Ti had time to think about it and realize he wasn't in any real danger then killing Gioele would likely be reportable. If Kuan Ti acted right after getting attacked then it may have been self defense. As for reporting Gioele, I believe he got his punishment.</p>

                <p>RP is fine as long as it is not unpleasant for the other players. It does not allow you to be too aggressive verbally, for instance, unless you make it very clear that it's your character speaking to the other characters, not a player talking to other players. Remember that some people are more sensitive than others, and that feeling attacked can be unpleasant in a game, even if it wasn't the purpose.</p><p>Of course, RP does not allow murder either, or dangerous actions, or any action that can harm the ship in any way. Punching someone can be fun, if it is clearly part of roleplay and if all characters involved are aware that it's only RP (it does not hurt to make an OOC comment to confirm it). And of course, punching a healthy person once is fine, but attacking someone who is wounded or punching several times is not fine at all.</p><p>Overreacting to RP can be reportable, but if the situation was not clearly RP or was excessive, if the player felt attacked, then murder can be understandable. Again, it depends a lot on the situation, on what was said and how, on what happened...</p>

Examples I mentioned must not be truth and a killing is always a something to look closely at, whether it was justified. well, I thought my uses of "maybe", "may", "if", "seems" were enough to show I was just speculating, but someone seemed to take it all as a written - in - stone answer.</p>

                <p>Only if it benefits the mush team - usually when the humans want to kill your partner anyway and you can seize the opportunity to gain some trust. Which means <strong>you had better have planned it ahead of time with your partner</strong>. You can't just turn on them to save your own skin.</p><p>I remember a game where a beta Eleesha selfishly turned on her alphas immediately after conversion, in hopes of being able to declare the ship "mush free" and sneak one home for the team. But it <strong>wasn't discussed</strong> among the mush team and she was definitely reported for it. (It also failed, because the human team was too smart to fall for it.)</p>

                <p>You can kill your partner if they are already discovered. In some cases, you <strong>have</strong> to kill them if the crew know that you are online and have the ability to help, because it would look suspicious not to do it. You also have to say something if you walk in on your partner extracting a spore or doing a mush action, or you would be suspected if you walked through the room and did not alert anyone. But of course that does not mean that you can't warn your partner and try to come up with a plan to delay their death or rampage.</p><p>Sometimes the mush can also decide to sacrifice one of them. That's acceptable too, as long as they all agree, especially the victim, of course.</p><p>What is not acceptable is to denounce your partner without any reason, or attract too much attention to them. Killing them out of the blue is not acceptable either.</p>

                <p>What clearly shouldn't be reported: personal offences and behaviour that isn't anyhow against the rules. If it seems that a player <strong>did</strong> break them, if they were harming the team, I don't see any problem in reporting, to be honest.<br>You don't have to know that for 100% - sometimes you just don't have enough evidence as a player, for example. <br><strong>But I'd suggest trying to explain those players what they did wrong and why that is wrong, while they're still on ship before filling a report</strong> (if there is such an opportunity). I'd say that's an important thing to do since 1) they really might not be knowing they're doing anything wrong (newish players or those who came back after long hiatus) and 2) Many players don't understand what they're punished for when they recieve a sanction and don't try to ask as well, so explaining should help in getting through this part.</p>

In general, if you believe the rules to have been broken, report the player.

                <p>I don't think arguing about it after they just updated the rules yesterday will change them but the "the people that haven't woken up yet had no say" part isn't understandable to me either. I understand why this kind of sol return is not wanted and therefore forbidden but that reasoning doesn't work for me.</p><p>Sure, <span class="tid_user tid_user_8744424 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8744424">izpodtishka</span> is right about the phrasing it wouldn't be <em>everyone</em> agreeing but <em>everyone awake at the moment</em>. But technically there would be no players behind the characters still sleeping and it should make no difference to them once they jump whenever they end up on that ship or another (unless they want to meet up with someone already on board but that person would not agree to return then). So no harm done to them.</p><p>But let's say everyone awake agrees, you start fixing pilgred and a new person wakes up shortly before they finish it. That person doesn't agree and you are back to waiting for the rest to wake up with an almost done pilgred, a nice present for the future mush. And then there's a story-wise flaw to returning to Sol pre-selection: you win if you return mush free, but you are not mush free. Your mush is just sleeping, you'll land in your rebel base, he'll wake up and infiltrate it and humanity is doomed: you lose. So I get the rule, but not the "the people that haven't woken up yet had no say"-explanation.</p><p>And Patryk, I think that you, having proven knowledgeable of the ban on it by asking these questions, would definitely get into trouble... if your newbies are active try to teach them rather than sigh at their lack of knowledge active newbies are the next generation, we need them. <br><span class="tid_wspoil">If they look promising, tell them there are better ships out there and bribe them with cookies to stay. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></span></p>

                <p>I can't speak for the SDF regarding the matter in question, but, since everything else is already well-said by Chime, I'd like to add to the "no say" part from the perspective of that very player, who wakes up after those who have joined before and made the choice, then (yes, let's say I am that player): people decide to break the game before it started (that already is the issue on it's own, for a multi-player one, right?) I join the broken game, a game that I was going to play, but now I can't - because either they're going to end it regardless of what I say or do (goodbye gold day or 2, all the time I've spend for coordinating with friends, and whatnot else) or I am supposed to be forcing them to play (eh?) with an almost finished Pilgred. Forcing people to play is ridiculous on it's own, and there's not much "playing" in a game with almost finished Pilgred since mush can finish it with a finger snap.</p><p>And the part that I, personally, can't understand, as a player: you (hypothetical you, not referring to anyone here) either want to play a game or you don't. If you don't want - then just don't play, if you do - you're welcome on board of Daedalus. But Mush is the kind of game where you can't choose the starting conditions and it's RNG-based (=&gt; you might start with conditions that are not perfect, more or less), so the more exact question would be "do you want to play <strong>this</strong> particular game?" My answer would be "yes" and so, here I am, joining the game, but.. well, I can't play it, apparently. And since I can't do anything about it, I would only like to ask in that situation all those people: guys, if you didn't want to play this game - why did you join the ship then?</p>

                <p>Ok, let's make it simple and stop that discussion that is going nowhere. <strong>People who launch a ship want to play Mush.</strong> It should be obvious, and yet it seems that it is not. "Playing Mush" means playing the actual game, fully, and one of its the main components is mush hunting or being mush. By ending a ship early, you deprive other people of the possibility to play the game as they expected to play it and as it should be played.</p><br><p><cite> the jump had already been planned.</cite><cite>Players have their own goals and everybody sees victory in another way</cite> That excuse is total nonsense. You can't start a game of soccer and decide that your goal is to score against your own team. You can't launch a Mush ship and decide to change the aim of the game. If you want to play differently, just launch casting ships.</p>

                <p>I would advise to try and talk to them in private first. I just ended a ship in which Janice never talked (I don't think she ever said one word in the main channel) and Chun barely talked. It turns out that they were both French.</p><p>But while Janice never talked and never listened (except when Hua started talking to her in French in private), Chun did her best. She did not speak much, but sometimes she did. And she also read the conversations and reacted. For instance, when we talked about placing the mycoalarms in the mush-hunting channel, Chun almost immediately said "I'll do it", and yet she hadn't said a word before.</p><p>I ended up reporting Janice, because she did not even try, she probably did not speak a word of English, and we could not count on her. She just comforted people at random since she did not know who needed it, she did not activate plasma shield or change the Bios settings... But I did not report Chun.</p><p>I also remember a Kuan Ti who never, ever talked, and we were all convinced that he was not French (it was a French ship). And then I addressed him directly after a few days, and he replied with a full paragraph in perfect French.</p><p>In short, you can't always assume that a mute player is not a native speaker, and it also depends on whether the lack of communication hurts the ship or not.</p>

                <p>1) Just to be sure: It's impossible to <strong>hide</strong> item pre-selection, it was disabled in one of earlier season changes. It's either held in someone's inventory or just moved to another room.</p><p>2) Judges can't judge another person then the one the report was filed for. Mods can do this, but this is reserved for really serious and/or repeated offenses. This means that the report would end up cleared, unless you luckily hit the right person.<br><em>Definitely don't report every person on board!</em> This way <strong>you</strong> might end up sanctioned for report abuse and wasting judges' time.</p><p>Best course of action in such situation is to wait with report. Call out the person that took the item in general chat, if they just forget to put it down, they probably will do so. Explain that it's violation of neutral play and spoiling. If still no one confesses to holding it in inventory, just wait until the item shows up - holder might die sooner or later or some kind of action will give them up. Then you can report.</p><p>All in all, you can wait with your report literally to the end of the ship. Report won't be judged sooner, anyway, and you will have more informations to report the right person for right violation of rules.</p>

                <p>I've been on many doomed ships that I've helped turn into a Cinderella story. By going AFK you become part of the problem that you're trying to avoid. There will always be people trying on a ship, no matter how doomed. By leaving those people behind you are worse than the inactives that caused you to do it. They likely just didn't want to play the game. You, however, would be actively abandoning people.</p><p>If a ship is as bad as you think it is then it wont be a long ship, regardless. You might be wrong, though. You, alone, might make all the difference in sending the ship back home mush free. Try to make the best of a bad situation. Go down honorably or get the ship home heroically.</p>

If you can see a way to get a mush win without secrecy, go for it. Roughly one third of my mush wins occurred after I was known to be mush (Sometimes I died before the humans finished dying, sometimes not). I've had a blast being a known mush and manipulating situations so that I could not be killed yet, or so that it cost so much to kill me right then and there were other urgent priorities that needed doing as much or more than killing me... Rarely I've managed to inconvenience the active humans so greatly that they were mostly defensive. There are strategies involving ceasefire and the capacity limitation of Icarus Bay that can help mush survive after being revealed.</p><p>If you have something like 8 active mush and 1 active human, the human probably cannot kill all the mush and get back to sol - but that human has to try. That human will be a pain to keep alive - because only humans get panic attacks - with only one human, that player will get ALL the panic attacks, potentially many per cycle.</p><p>This is a problem though:</p><p>-They order the human not to attack them, and the human obeys. Finally, they give a few ground-rules such as 'stay out of the lab!'</p><p>Humans and mush cannot knowingly cooperate. That human may -choose- to appear to obey while preparing however they are trying to win.</p><p>Example: I am your human. I think 'Oh @#$@#, I have 1 move, 0 AP, and there are 8 living mush and me'. You tell me to cooperate and you let me live as human for now, I tell you thank you (maybe report you for inciting spoiling - that is sanctionable of you to do), and use my time to get AP to try and kill you all. I have to - have to - I cannot win while there are mush alive. I know who the mush are. I MUST kill you or die in the attempt. I will not stop trying to kill you (thus I am not sanctionable). I'm not in trouble because you made the deal to me or because I appear to accept it - so long as I try to win for my team. You can be in trouble for offering it.</p><p>A very legal way to do this plan:</p><p>Keep 1+ humans alive and human, the ones you believe are easiest to trick. They can even be inactives that are kept alive by Janice comforts and medkit fighting off starvation. I recommend keep more than one alive - panic attacks are NASTY when there's only one player getting all of them. Do your very very best to make those humans believe you're all human, and seek Eden together.</p></cite>

                <p>Yes. You can notify the player that holding items pre-selection is not allowed and submit a report. Also if the report shows with no doubt that XP-farming is happening, it may be sanctioned. Especially when it also prevents the passing of titles to an active person.</p>

                <p>You actually did say that Chao gets away with random killings because he gets glory. The additional bits were confusing (at least to myself and Peanutz) and didn't seem like they applied to Chao.</p><p>It was a crucial distinction that needed to be made in that original post. That's why there's warning text there. It's not like it gives you SDF points or acts against you in any way. It's simply the best way we had (shy of deleting your post) to make the distinction incredibly clear before anyone sees it and starts thinking it's ok for Chao to kill people at random.</p>

                <p>Either scenario is suspicious enough (either allowing Terrence to stay dirty or Terrence refusing to shower) that I'd be looking at why he's dirty... what did he say to the crew? is it fishy? as a player on the ship, is there a legitimate belief that he's probably a mush?</p><p>However, it absolutely <strong>is</strong> possible to take random damage from showering, as well as picking up the soap. One or the other is fairly plausible, both would be incredibly unlucky, but conceivably possible. While Chao would be well advised NOT to kill someone <strong>just</strong> for that reason, I'd still look to the questions above to see if there was legitimate belief beyond just not being full health anymore.</p><p>Whether Terrence turns out to be mush or not is beside the point.</p>

If that was a usual report and not a manual sanction, which only happens due to severe griefing so i guess is not the case.</p><p>Also, you don't get quarantined for one sanction only - it happens only after multiple rule breakages. So even if it was unfair, in which case you should message in mod inbox as said above, it wasn't the reason of the quarantine on its own, so to say.</p>

                <p>Welp, I've searched and searched and cannot find an answer, so I'll try here. Apologies if I missed something. It's about pre-selection neutral gameplay. This is all before selection started, so if the ship is active I don't think it'll affect anything.</p><p>So this ship had the Lizaro Jungle BP, and quite a few active pilots pre-selection. I was planning my sofa-making mission, except someone who had been doing inventory went ahead and dismantled the AD shower. Gioele had paranoid, so there were extra cameras and they were already installed.<br>The soap was also missing (probably held by a griefer), thus both showers would have cost the same in AP.</p><p>I argued that this was *not* a neutral action. I was shouted down by the active members of the crew that mush would "take silent showers in AD" - to which I asked, didn't AD have a camera?? I was not given a straight answer to that one (and didn't have MP to check.) And wasn't that the point exactly? If you become mush, then <em>you just hurt your team</em> and it's not a neutral action. Is that correct?</p><p>So which is it? I was given to understand that having the Lizaro Jungle BP meant we could have two showers. Why would dismantling a shower automatically be a neutral action?</p><p>(There were other random-killing shenanigans but honestly I'm too lazy to file a report.)</p><p>(They also rushed Convenient Sink as the first project, though I honestly have no idea if that's related or not.)</p>

                <p>Showering is a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mushpedia.com/wiki/Privacy_Levels">private action</a>, so it won't be displayed in the logs regardless of camera being installed or not.</p><p>Neutral play is aimed at preventing any of teams, mush or human, getting advantages before the competitive game starts. Meanwhile, players need to do something while ship's still filling and keep the ship in a playable further condition.</p><p>Now, taking those points and all the explanations from mods about neutral play on forums into account, I'll try to give an explanation from my point of view and hope to be corrected in case I'm somehow wrong about it.<br>If no cameras are installed - humans have no place to be safe in, while mush can infect/convert them with no extra efforts, completely unnoticeable, thus placing cameras in dorms at least, and giving them some spots to be safe at - isn't ruining the balance.<br>If both showers are functional - mush can secretely shower with no chance for getting any evidence about that. With one functioning shower, however, mush can still secretly take a shower, but humans get a minor evidence to work with in their investigation. So balance isn't disrupted in that case as well.</p><p>Plus, if things like doing inventory, neutral research, dismantling a shower, building sofa, etc, will be prohibited - 1) what would be left to do that whole time while ship's filling? and 2) if nothing would be done in order to keep the ship afloat, humans are likely to have significant difficulties when it finally fills and the overall condition might be pretty screwed to have a normal game.</p>

                <p>It's not just about individual crewmembers' morale, it's about harming the ship and the human team in general. Frankly, I fail to see the benefit of killing all inactives, except if you think that the mush is active and might use them as transfer targets (especially dangerous characters). Apart from that risk, keeping inactives alive does not harm anyone and can have benefits, for instance the chance to trade against something useful or even vital. On the other hand, killing them deprives the ship of that chance, causes morale loss and sometimes serious illnesses (whereas an inactive dying naturally can die of depression and cause no morale loss), and it is also a waste of AP that could be use for more important things. Cold-Blooded is a poor excuse, since it generally takes more than 3 AP to kill someone. To me, killing an inactive is not much better than playing with the kube, since in both cases, there are always more important things to do.</p>

                <p>i am familiar with the word griefer from other games, not 100% sure what it means here in mush But if i understand the meaning correct NOT ALL quarantine Reasons are because of griefing. the reason for my quarantine was 100% not Griefing, it was not knowing that food tests are not allowed anymore since back in season 1 it was ok and i just came back after quitting in S1 to know from SDF rules that it isnt more or less. (i am not here to talk about that, but now you know since you directly assumed anyone who gets quarantines is a griefer, and you are dead wrong of course from my perspective)</p><p>so i would like an answer still if there is any since taking the question out of context doesnt answer it. <br>the Question could´t be more clear so set the reason for the ban aside and consider the ban was for an innocent first mistake player. now why do the other players have to pay for that? and why wouldnt the ban start once the player is out of ships?</p>

                <p>The quarantine system doesn't really discriminate. And I'm quite sure in Die2Nite, if someone were to magically get banned while within a town <em>cough cough gadget cough</em> for whatever reason, they would immediately be removed from said town? Would you complain about that, if they had, to use some example of serious grief there, punched people then hidden at the town gates so as to prevent retaliation?</p><p>We get waves of griefers here on occasion. As in, every so often about 3 or 4 people appear on each ship, then start indiscriminately murdering as soon as Mush are selected. Being able to immediately respond to that and prevent them from doing any additional harm to that ship is doubtlessly <em>extremely</em> helpful.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">And it sounds like you got banned for something to do with food tests; mush tests're allowed, so long as it is done by choice. Attempting to coerce someone to do one, or killing them for not doing one, is bannable, and a portion of the community considers food testing immediately to be... dishonourable?</span></p>

                <p>yes thanks for clearing that up as well , i was a bit surprised at first but i picked up on that soon enough. i remembered having SDF points from 2 years ago back in season 1 , i do not remember why though. this new report must have brought the points to first quarantine level.</p><p>i assume this means that the reason of Quarantine is irrelevant for the mods regardless how harmless/harmful the latest report is. the only thing that counts is SDF points. good to know. <br>thanks for clearing that up. <br>it sure is a bit better than what i thought when i started asking. BUT its still sad for the ships that gets those kills.</p><p>if its public i would love to see the list of needed points for each Quarantine level and for type of rule broken to see if the first one is worth instant kill instead of waiting til current ship is over.</p>

                <p>People on my ship really insist to get me to do a food test. They have been paranoid since two mushes died, and Eleesha don't have tracker to check whether or not we are mush free.</p><p>First Hua said " there might be anonymush on board and we have no way to find out for sure except mush testing.. The grey side: some people have ambivalent thoughts about "forcing people to mush test" because it would 'take out the fun of the game' (I don't think so) .. So we should debate about a way to make sure everybody is happy (or at least every human) .</p><p>I personally recommend to mush test at least the people who are frequentally in BD (me, Eleesha, Jin Su, Terrence, Ian, Janice) "</p><p>Yesterday I became a logistic expert to help Frieda because Paola isn't logistic expert so she has only 1 :pa: per cycle .. And I took medlab bed. Now they think I might want to infect Frieda and Paola said "Just double eat. Or we will continue to suspect you and maybe one day we will kill uou... too bad ."</p><p>Is it against the rules ? Would it be agaisnt the rules only if I was mush ? (i'm human) <br>So if they kill me as a human, I can't report them ?</p><p>Thank you</p>

                <p>So I told her that it's against the rules, and according to her, I "want to report anybody who is interested in playing a good game " I answered " That's your definition of good game. I wonder if you're right why the FDS and some other players don't share your view then." And she said " I wonder as a dev, why I have to search in a forum for 'the rules' - if they would be that important, they would be announced ingame " and I said that if I were mush I would have reported her, and she said "If you were human, you would simply double-eat instead of writing sentences beginning with "If I were mush" .</p><p>But I decided to report her , because that's too much x) <br>Isn't it obvious why is it not allowed ?<br>I hope you'll have enough proof to do something about it.</p>

                <p>Aceb, I wasn’t judging your advice here. The comment about personal opinion was referring to all the “I care/don’t care about this”, to “I don’t find his rule being fair”, to “I don’t even know for sure what this rule means but I think this is what you should do” kind of messages since this thread is not meant for such kind of chatter and I honestly don’t understand why people should waste their time going through them and have troubles with finding answers they’re looking for.</p><br><p>Also, I don’t recall mod’s comments on the matter being anyhow like what you’re saying (I think you’re referring to reports about inactivity, claiming it to be xp-farming). Judges are supposed to look into the evidence regardless of the report message – there’s no such thing as “in case it says xp-farming – clear ASAP”. However, the more accurate the report message is – the easier it is to find certain evidence (there’s usually really a lot data to go through, guys) or understand what the reporter was pointing at to start with – since it’s not always possible to find out what went wrong on the ship if the message isn’t informative.</p><br><p>To add to Aceb's advice here, I’d suggest pointing out what the player did wrong, so judges could check that out and see if that should be sanctioned. Report their actions instead of classifying those actions – judges are capable of doing that themselves <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Like, “griefing”, “playing against team”, “xp farming”, etc. Tell what the player did wrong instead and judges will decide if it was the said griefing, playing against ones team and xp-farming. <br>If you don’t have anything specific to point at in the player’s behavior, that is actually harmful - it likely means that there’s no ground for reporting them (eg, you dislike the person or jump to conclusions without any facts proving them).</p>

                <p>To expand on that answer (it's true, though!) - it applies equally to Chun because the point of the rule is to give everyone (including mush) a fighting chance. If Chun is already holding knife, armor and a blaster (for instance), that severely hampers the mush team from being able to use those items.</p>

                <p>Roleplay should not harm the ship in any way. It can be allowed to affect your gameplay, but only as long as it doesn't impact the ship and the survival of the crew. For instance, a pilot cannot refuse to kill hunters if the ship is in danger. As you say yourself, not telling Janice your exact morale might make her use too much AP. That is also detrimental to the crew, especially on long ships where every AP count. You can easily RP your character's morale and add an OOC comment with the exact number.</p><p>Besides, it gives people a very bad example. It is very tiring to have crewmembers just say "I am injured" or "I need morale" without saying how much exactly, no matter how many times you ask them to be more precise. In the long run, it is really harmful, because either you use too much AP on heals and comforting, or you don't spend enough and people end up dying. It's already difficult enough to get your crew to understand that without giving the bad example on purpose.</p>

                <p>I want to add something though. I personally don't see the need to tell anyone in early days (while mushes alive) your exact health and morale though. So if I say “i need 2 healings“ or “plz comfort me twice to feel better“, that is sufficient and is not affecting crew survival, isn' t it?<br>Eventually you are in danger to tell a mush your exact morale problems too.<br>Maybe leaving some possibilities available against metagaming is a good thing.

                <p>Tell me more... Right now I got ship with several people making bad choices, rather anti-their-team choices (I don't believe we got 5 mushes already after early 1 Alpha dead), and when you ask them why they do/don't what they should, they just smirk and play "funny guys", sometimes straightly ignoring the threat of infection etc. Yeah, its somehow fun, and somehow original - but it harms the gameplay a lot at the same time when you try to figure out right who's who on the ship. Well, at least they gathered oxygen before we suffocated.</p>

The rest is game rules. Don't get me wrong, I love roleplay, but You have to know how to do it properly with rules not being broken. I remember on one ship Derek and Stephen punching themselfs in the name of getting Janice (was hilarious btw), it was just 1 punch trade, on day change, before expedition, so no one was harmed, guys performed beautiful show with RP, using only 2 punch actions with no harm and doing 95% other stuff via - text. It's even better if You let your imagination make the stuff instead of doing it via game.</p><p>Secondly, if rules would allow such more RP (like RP depression, etc.), then people would try to find loopholes, allowing negative actions or very harmful RP.</p><br><p>Basically the better roleplayers, the better RP, the better stuff You can create and later share it in [AP] thread! You have enough freedom and space, to perform such actions, while not hitting the rules.<br><br><span class="tid_wspoil">Not gonna talk anymore about this here, if anyone wanna discuss, make a thread and lets go there.</span></p>

                <p>I mean in this instance? Unless they out right said they were mush or something, I don't believe it's against the rules. One can't infiltrate Eden or Sol if the ship dies, and given the honor system is a little ineffective, the only real achievements you can get are the ones for pulling off some sort of feat (living 10, 15, 20 days, reaching Eden or Sol as either mush or human...ect).<br>But then again, that's more of the impression the wiki gives me...</p>

                <p>It's a pretty common strategy. When you become mush, you become far more careful on how you do stuff. You won't go eat bluntly out of nowhere, you just don't step in everyroom without being worried about having people thirsty for your blood. (cus most humans tend to do food test after they have been suspected) That way you play more humanly.</p><p>The problem is, sometimes, mush forget when they need to deal the damage. Like my last game I was Frieda, and kinda saved the ship by finding an O2 planet. Simply because I had plans to convert people or use it as a chance to rampage when everyone are busy. I rampaged and converted couple of people ending the ship. So I played so much like a human yet knew when to rampage. Some people due to some reasons, just play human and never do a damage and finally die by number of proven humans.</p>

                <p><strong>Shortly</strong>, in Mush gameplay it's forbidden to lead the game into human win, I mean the scenario where the ship reaches Sol/Eden without Mush on board. Everything else is fine.</p><p><strong>Longer</strong>, you can't admit to be Mush without causing human harm, you can't expose your partner once you're exposed for the purpose of getting them killed, you can't get yourself cured or any of your Mush partners (you can still work on RFS as long as you're going to avoid this scenario). You can't kill any of your Mush partners once you're exposed (you can still attack them if you make sure it doesn't get them killed, for the purpose of keeping them covered), you can't attack your partner once you're both exposed, you can't kill your Mush partner if they're doing well as Mush, and as long as they don't break any of these above rules you can't kill them if you don't gain human's trust for it. Also you can't mimic human when you're aware that you're about to get killed, mostly when investigators found all other humans confirmed where you stay in position which you can't be human in their eyes. You can't leave human team without Mush with access to Sol.</p><p>And remember that the intention important, not the effect. You won't be sanctioned if you caused human win by mistake when you clearly intended to win as Mush on the ship you were in. It's a game, where you can't be sure of Mush win when human also plays for their win. But remember that surrender is never an option.</p>

It was said before that amnesia alone was a valid reason to kill a person, but that defeats the entire purpose of allowing the person to play amnesia to start with. It was being discussed and petered out before we got around to officially deciding to put it in the rules post, but I'll bring it back up to verify if we want to take it to that level.</p>

Why would be something in the game like this sanctionable? There are hard try players who try to achieve 100% job done on their side and so, it is most possible as Paola. It is a base like any else, just is not so beneficial to human team (AND IT IS ONLY BENEFICIAL FOR HUMAN TEAM [glory])<br><br>Because most players if not everyone do not care about that stuff, it is mostly ignored.<br><br>Cube is personal gain only + You have only 10% each try. It is waste of your AP and giving your team actually a reason to get rid of You, as You do not help and make game only more difficult (AP spend).<br><br>Glory research are the same stuff as Paola base. They can be done if someone want to achieve 100% research done BUT, if You will do glory research before doing most important ones, You might be considered a mush that tries to avoiding working on proper research. It is just basically stuff to do after there's nothing else important to do. <br><br>Doing cube only is sanctionable. <br>Doing glory base as Paola is either self-achievement thing or something You could start suspecting comm officer (but it is not even close to justify anything in case of aggresive action).<br>Doing research glory is acceptable if all other research is done, mostly, after mush hunt and nexus projects are done and You're still not getting that much random events that You can afford wasting some AP.</p>

                <p>As far as I know.. If it's more beneficial to the human team to kill a human, then it's justified.. In your case Dream, if the commander can not log in much and therefore never moves the ship, it's more AP resourceful to kill him than to hack each time. In a situation like that you should open a Private Channel with everyone except Jin Su and make sure they agree with killing Jin Su for a more active commander.</p><p>I think I remember hearing about an annoying and careless Derek (he did things like idle in Raluca's room) being killed right before the crew returned to Sol, although a different situation than your Jin Su (Since nobody liked Derek on that ship). My point is: If most the other crew agree with the issue, it's <em>usually </em>justified.</p>

                <p>It would depend. If the Jin Su is trying his best to be useful when he is around, you could set up a Commander thread for him to favorite, which he can easily refer to and find out exactly what he needs to do with his limited time (is there a planet to move to? What direction and is fuel loaded?). A couple times a day can still be workable, especially if you happen to have an IT Expert around for emergency hacking.</p><p>However, if he isn't reading chat or willing to do the best he can with his time constraints to help the ship, then there shouldn't be much problem with calling up your crewmates to discuss an assassination.</p>

                <p>Have you attempted to speak to Jin Su about his active times and work something out? Killing someone to relieve a title is a touchy but fairly common situation (Especially for Comms officers). If you feel it's within the ships best interests to kill someone in order to relieve a title then you need to make sure you've done what you could to resolve it other ways first. Talk to him and talk to the crew. Make sure there is a trail of effort to follow in order to protect yourself and to tell us judges that you tried. Hear what he has to say then get a crew vote.</p><p>Also make sure he's as inactive as you say. If we see that he's been online for far more than you think and he just happens to have active times that are opposite to the expo teams then it might result in some disciplinary action. Don't forget that this server, while English, is played by players internationally. But if you're sure it's not an issue with time difference and it's just dangerously low activity, then it could be OK to kill him.</p>

If the ship is healthy, mush free, and calm then ask the crew for permission and it shouldn't be an issue. Just be sure that they are an xp farmer/inactive first. I just wouldn't recommend wasting resources on killing them, they usually end up starving regardless. If they're eating food and doing nothing with the AP then sure. Again, just make sure they're doing nothing.</p>

                <p>Try as hard as you can to see if you can function by using the hacker kit. Especially if Frieda has IT skill since that increases the odds of success. If you've got an IT book, give it to Gio to use with the coffee. I was hacker Frieda for the majority of my last ship and we did pretty ok, even with me also being the primary scanner. (Though it was an oddly low activity ship that did extremely well for its circumstances. We usually had a few cycles for me to gain more AP before I needed to move us)</p><p>If you're finding that it's becoming a life or death matter and that passing that title makes the difference, yes, it can be acceptable AFTER it's discussed with the crew and you have a majority decision to do that.</p>

                <p>This is a good example of barely active jin su doing so little as commander that frieda who hacked commander terminal did 50-80% of the ships moving <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/10439" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/10439</a></p><p>We thought about killing jin since the start when mush was still alive (ye we thought that jin isn't mush since day 2-3, but still) and even after they were dead, jin defended idlers fiercfully while not being active either, ate more than he should have and scanned and did other things when asked not to . We were going to kill him at least 5 times, but as all command line - Jin su , Stephen , Gioele were ..... well how to express myself ......</p><p>Jin su - barely active , barely listens to anything .<br>Stephen - does whatever , not a word said and harmed the ship allot .<br>Gioele - seemingly exp farmer who later died from idleness and spoke at day 8-10 only and just few words .</p><p>We thought about killing all 3 just to get title to frieda and it would have been the right thing to do , no one should have been sanctioned, but we somehow managed just leaving them to die by themselves and thanks to Frieda being such an amazing hacker we did eden . <br>If we had killed all 3 it would have taken allot of APs (morale wasn't the problem) so decision was made not to waste APs on any of them unless something changed and to just continue in the search for eden and that was the right choice .</p><p>Most of the time i had to convince crew not to kill jin su at least till we deal with other 2 in line (till they die or till someone kills them) and by the time they died frieda got used to hacking and jin became a little bit more reasonable with consuming jumpkins (still was enough reason to kill him for being barely active and not having APs to move when he was on as he scanned too much...). Still it was his <strong>1rst ship</strong> so glad that we did not kill him and gave him the best ship he had <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>People kept asking do we kill jin su yet ? Can i kill him ? What do we do about him ? <br>When like 4 people want to kill commander ... you know that its a reasonable thing to do and you will only profit the ship .</p><p>I do not believe that SDF crew would have punished anyone even if we killed all 3 soon after we dealt with mushes . This is what some wanted and others had no opinion in this matter or dd not want to meddle and left the choice for those who knew what they were doing .</p>

                <p>Thanks for that. Andie converted Raluca on my last ship when we deconverted him with the RFS. Raluca went and reconverted him at some point unknown to the rest of us and he ended up "winning" with Raluca when we returned to Sol with little oxygen. Is there a way to report someone after a ship has ended if stuff like this happens?</p>

There's much better alternative: you can use transfer to reset skills, converting the old body telling the new Mush to swap roles. The problem (apart from spores and AP needed for conversion) is Transfer and two Anonymush skills to take, but if successful, you gain a Mush.</p>

And what about this other case then:</p><br><p>Same scenario with all three mushe in the bridge, but the one who is going to be cured is jin su (by other mush of course, so that there are no humans there) and before that, walkie is dropped and shelf is trapped <strong>and</strong> also the commander's terminal is trapped. Now let's say the ship is surrounded by enough hunters to get the ship destroyed, and that for whatever reason (afk pilots, turrets and patrol ships without charges, whatever you want) the only way to save the ship is to move it (and the fuel has been charged) and that jin su has only 1 ap to moe the ship and no humans within that range of one ap to go talk to them.</p><p>What does Jin do? Do they access the terminal and convert himself? Or he does nothing and hopes for someone to go up there before cycle change?</p>

                <p>Still, bridge. <strong>Anyone</strong> can talk freely on bridge, walkie-talkie in inventory or not. That's how bridge works.</p><p>And before you come with other examples: Humans can eat. Usually, there's some food to be found within those three rooms one AP makes you able to go. Without that one AP, most 1-2 mushes won't be able to convert you in one cycle (or day, for that matter). Cured human can wait for cycle change and try to run, as soon as they get some APs an MPs.</p><p>On the side note, your scenarios are getting quite specific. Those things usually don't happen in this kind of "perfect-stormy" way. And it's starting to look like you're just looking for loopholes.</p>

Now let's say the ship is surrounded by enough hunters to get the ship destroyed, and that for whatever reason (afk pilots, turrets and patrol ships without charges, whatever you want) the only way to save the ship is to move it (and the fuel has been charged) and that jin su has only 1 ap to moe the ship and no humans within that range of one ap to go talk to them.</p><p>What does Jin do? Do they access the terminal and convert himself? Or he does nothing and hopes for someone to go up there before cycle change?</p></cite><p>Aside from the high potential of rule-breaking both cases are really bad gameplay. There's literally no reason to inject the serum instead of just picking Anonymush. You even got 2 Mush in the same room to testify a skill reset. Unless you have another human sitting in the room carefully watching. Although then it'd be best to convert them instead. You got 3(more likely 4, because Mushovore should have been completed as well) spores to convert your just cured Mush back. Why on earth would you do that, if you can convert another human?<br>Unless it's Chun sitting in the room with you carefully watching. However this would raise the question why the hell she isn't applying the serum herself.</p><p>It's possible to come up with a better plan after 5-10 minutes - not to say on the spot because that was basically the time I needed to read through all those posts. Gameplay-wise this is so horrifyingly bad, that you probably already suspected yourself it's rule-breaking. In such cases you should automatically consider and look for alternatives. Suspecting a plan may be report-/sanctionable is very often a sign for very poor play as well. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Only in very exceptional circumstances does intervention happen before a ship completes. <strong>Generally</strong> someone's choice of skills is not a violation of the rules unless the expressed intent is to make the game more difficult or challenging for their team. As it's not a violation of the rules (with exception as above), it would reasonably follow that that reason <strong>alone</strong> is not justification enough to kill someone.</p><p>If either party feels a rule was violated, they're welcome to report it. If anyone feels they're being harassed, they're welcome to report it. The SDF is <strong>not</strong> in the business of ignoring <strong>any</strong> reports.</p><p>As for whether it's reportable to be shortsighted and stuffy? It <strong>can</strong> be. More specifically, there's not going to be much harm in filing a report. Can't really say if a violation happened without all the information included in a report. But perhaps if he calms down or he turns out to be all bark and no bite, everybody could find a way to make up and move on.</p>

                <p>Cross is absolutely correct. Since there are clear threats and intent to kill the victimized party based on their skill selection, any action (without any other evidence) taken to kill the victim after selection would likely be met with action by the SDF after the ship is over. I would likely give points in such a circumstance and that person would be surprised by how little we ignore.</p><p>As Cross said, unless there is intent to deliberately harm the game with their skill selection, it is the player's choice to choose what skills they want to use.</p>

                <p>Hang on a second. It was asked if this is <strong>reportable</strong>, not sanctionable.</p><p>Anything that you believe to be overly toxic or playing against ones own team is absolutely reportable. Judges and mods have access to logs that you don't have and can see the whole picture. Whether he gets sanctioned or cleared is up in the air until the judgement is handed out, but as long as you're not reporting people all willy nilly, just about anything is <strong>reportable</strong>.</p><p>From what little I've seen here (and with the admission that we've only seen two messages that sound like a small minority), I personally think it's worth taking a closer look at.</p>

                <p>Is it playing against your team (And so also against the rules) when a player never talks, spends AP on random stuff like repairing turrets, advancing projects we arent working on (in one case even completing a project when the vote was 3v3) and so on? Especially when told several times to stop advancing the wrong projects or when we havent voted. And to stop repairing things we dont need. <br>And a captain who just doesn't move the ship but instead keeps scanning for planets when we have a planet? Ofcourse we can kill these people but im wondering if they are also breaking the rule to not play against your team. (The chance of them being mush is slim)</p>

                <p>It's hard to say without seeing the logs of that specific case.</p><p>It MIGHT be, if the player is doing it all with purpose to make game harder for others. That might be a case with finishing wrong projects or going AFK with important stuff in inventory or refusing to move the ship even after being told to do so numerous times. It almost definitely isn't when it comes to fixing random doors, fuel tanks and turrets.</p><p>But too often I see reports of first-time players just testing what they can do in this game being called griefers. Some of them even dropped their walkie-talkies right after they ended tutorial, never reading the other players' advices to stop doing all those annoying things. Personally (other judges might be less lenient), I usually clear those reports unless there's a severe damage caused by them. After all, most of them got killed for their troubles, and others start being useful for their crew when the ship goes for longer voyage. That should be enough lesson for them for next ships.<br>Other times, people <strong>think</strong> they voiced their opinion on said "griefer's" actions clearly, while logs show that they actually didn't, and "griefer" could misunderstand what he's doing wrong.</p><p>Anyway, if in doubt, and you think that you exhausted all other ways to lead them back on the "right path," feel free to report. Judges will see the logs and decide whether the case was real griefing or just confused newbie not meaning any harm. And if their actions are harmful to the ship, don't shy away from killing the person - there's no reason to risk the whole ship.</p>

                <p>Is the captain following the very helpful tips? Is he communicating? Perhaps a quiet kind word in a private channel could help. Is the hacker kit available for someone else to hack and move ship instead?</p><p>Are they new? The game can be quite daunting. I was a total newbie (in the first month or two of the game going public) and after the ship, one of the crew contacted me and explained things in a nice way (I had chosen to play Roland, and the only skill I picked was Shooter). Without that, I might have given up the game as I had thought I was assassinated for no reason.</p>

                <p>Honestly, I cant tell myself if these players are new or just dont care about the rest of the crew. They have been told multiple times to not advance the wrong projects, to not scan for planets when we have planets, and use the AP for something more useful instead. The captain has been told to move the ship for about 2 days now but he keeps scanning planets instead (We do plan on killing him). And they barely talk ever. Its hard to know if they are new players or stupid players or just griefers like this too. And even if they are new players they arent very good new players, as in they listen to none of the things people are saying. They also havent dropped their talkies, as I have seen them saying stuff, but thats things like "Ill fix this thing noone needs", "(Project noone wanted) at x%" etc. And even thats like once a day tops with no follow up ever. They often take stuff and move them without telling anyone (because they just dont talk much at all).</p>

                <p>Sometimes people don't have much time to spend on reading/writing and they don't bother reading the answers on thing they posted a day ago cos there're tons of other new messages in gen chat. <br>IMO, the best way to find out if a player doesn't understand something/is new/is griefing/being completely ignorant to ship's needs is - by sending a PM.<br>If a player doesn't know the major duties the character they've picked is responsible for - they might be new to the game or to this particular character. But if they've been contacted directly and explained what they should be doing/what their mistakes are, yet they keep acting same way and ignoring their direct duties or harming the ship with their actions (say, eating fruits that need to be planted, completing bad projects in spite of crew's decision and ship's needs, etc) despite being active - then there's obviously a problem involved.</p>

                <p>I'm not sure I understand the question, but you can't do an obvious mush action that has no consequence, just because you want to be killed but don't want to be sanctioned. That doesn't work. If you do an obvious mush action <strong>on purpose</strong> in order to be killed or just in order to say that you're mush, then it is the same as confessing that you are mush.</p><p>But if you do mush actions <strong>because you are playing your role as a mush</strong>, then there is nothing reportable. And saying "I am mush" when the human crew already know that you are mush is not a confession. You said the mush were "taking over the ship", that means that you are aware of who they are because they are acting in the open. I don't see anything wrong in that.</p>

                <p>Hypothetical question here with a frame for reference.

With that said, you would play from there on as if you had just started the game, without any knowledge of what happened, who were the other <em>mushes</em>, etc. I'm going with total-amnesia here.</p><p>Is it possible for you, as a <em>mush</em>, to do a Death-note roundabout and plan your re-conversion to the <em>mush</em> knowing that you would be injected with the RFS?</p><p>Let's imagine that I'm Terry, the only Tech on board. I booby-trap the 2 Oxygen tanks, the Alpha Bay 2, the 2 Fuel Tanks, etc. Then, I'm turned with the RFS back to human. I allege "amnesia" and go on with my life. Oxygen Tanks break and Terry, as the only Tech on board, jumps to fix them, getting spored. The cycle goes on until I get all the 3/4 spores needed for conversion. I do not go out and infect myself on purpose, but use a "total amnesia" to forget that the places were trapped in the first place, and just act as if I were human, without any bias.</p><p>Is this machiavellic plan allowed under SDF rules?</p>

                <p>Dear <span class="tid_user tid_user_1319487 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1319487">Asgardian</span>. I have read Your question and I must say that as interesting RPing wise Your idea is, that is something that is absolutly not allowed under SDF rules.</p><p>Why is it not allowed? Answer is simple - RPing can not go in a way of gameplaying. You as player will posses knowledge about those spores and even if You will RP total amnesia (reminder to everybody - killing player who claims amnesia just because he did so <strong>is forbidden</strong>!), You must take care of Your gameplay. From gameplay point of view, what You just suggested is just like using Mr. Cat to become mush. Or triple-sporing food and hiding it, than eating after being RFSed.</p><p>Yes! I know! Your idea does not look the same at first glance! After all You will perform actions that are required by Your character and You won't rush to get Your own spores infect you. But that is just first glance. In reality You do know that those spores are there and You will just tigger them off.</p><p>Also... Regarding knowing that You will be RFSed - if You are mush and You know You will be RFSed, than Your duty is to do every single thing to not allow that. Rampage, run away, sabotage research (by dismantling Mush Genome disk for example)... Do whatever You can to not allow that. Letting humans to RFS You is also against SDF rules on it's own rights. I know - sometimes You can't do anything to stop humans from using RFS. But even if that is the case Your duty as agent of mush is to cause as much harm as that is possible.</p>

                <p>The masterplan is always for the mush to win. Letting oneself be "cured" is only part of the plan. From there on, if all things go accordingly, you are reconverted and spend the rest of the ship above suspicion and allowed to act as a <em>mush</em> freely. Isn't that a greater goal than just a rampage?</p><p>In any case, the proposed plan is different than using the cat to infect yourself deliberately (if the crew knew it was infected), or triple eating infected food because there is no logic there and is clearly on purpose. Both are actions that are not part of the normal gameplay, which you correctly stated.</p><p>Using an <strong>amnesia</strong> scenario, my gameplay does not conflict with the spores. If there is something needed to be fixed, I would be the one to fix it. With or without spores. I wouldn't be infecting myself deliberately.</p><p>The same could be said about Chao trapping the turrets that he would later on use to shoot hunters, or a pilot trapping all the 3 bays. If all actions are gameplay-standard, do they still conflict with the rules?</p>

                <p>I'd like to add that the answer above is an answer in general.</p><p>While in the case in question (from what I see as it is described) Finola was intentiously threatening Raluca's life with no pressing circumstances that could've "made" her do that, especially since Ralua had a valid reason for occupying Medlab (for rushing PS). However, it might still have been a poor reason for such harsh resolving as killing, especially with no discussion with Chun and etc.<br><strong>So nothing certain can be concluded without action log and chat log. </strong><br>(we don't even know such a discussion existed or not)</p>

                <p>I've seen several times two people fighting for one bed. The other beds were either occupied or a certain person felt the need to take the only bed in the room. The reasons were either having the more important job, being the first to occupy the bed, the one taking the bed was supposed to have full AP bar or being "confirmed human" when the other was not. They were kicking off each other and in the end either somebody gave up, sometimes becoming inactive starving out to the death or at least twice somebody being killed: once on accident where semi-active victim was on low HP, second time confirmed human getting killed on purpose. I see it's not alright to kick somebody active off the bed, but I get confused when asked if it's sanctionable. What do rules say about both people kicking off each other to take the bed and its fatal ending?</p>

                <p>Ah... Well Patryk - that is very situational really. It would depend on many factors if kicking somebody out of bed with fatal ending is sanctionable or not. As You Yourself pointed out - it may be done by accident when one that is kicking out of bed does not know that person using bed is low on HP (pro advice - read logs people!).</p><p>But let's follow situation that You provided (in a way that I do understand).</p><p>So... We have two players. Let's say Roland and Kuan Ti. Both have important job. KT is working as Tech on Plasma Shield, while Roland is Pilot and needs AP for shooting hunters. Ideally they should both get bed. They are both active and so far worked for benefit of their team. But they can not both get bed. Only one can get it. And insted of talking this over they start kicking each other out of beds. They do this all the time, whenver one comes online and sees that has been kicked out of bed - instantly kick another one out of it and claims bed for himself. Yes?</p><p>That kind of situation. And after few cycles one gets killed due to low HP. That is of course sanctionable. Those two players are already propably wasting more AP than they would get from having bed. Moreover their selfish gameplay hurts their team as whole (because neither hunters will be shooted down, nor Plasma Shield will be worked on, while AP spent on kicking each other will raise difficulty AND death following such conflict will mean 1 active crew member less and 1 morale for everybody less. Or two if pregnant! This could be KT and Hua conflict for example...). So absolutly sanctionable in that specific situation. For both of them. They both do know that kicking off hurts other crew member. They both know that when HP reaches zero, person dies. They deliberatly hurt each other. In that situation even if one of them would have better claim to bed, that is not reason to continue such fight till one dies. Of course - we assume that they are both in same team.</p>

                <p>The short and simple answer is "if you intended to kill the person for occupying a bed they had a legitimate reason to use, it's sanctionable".</p><p>In cases where pettiness consumes both people and multiple hits are registered from one or more participants, it's a very grey area. Perceived intent comes into play as well as trying to figure out where the line got crossed from reasonable to unreasonable. I'd say that if kicking someone out of bed comes to a fatal ending, it should be reported and let the judges look into it.</p>

                <p>Also, those things are not so broken, as it might seem and/or game has mechanics that make it less broken. Just to make notes to your own examples:</p><p>1) There can't be more then 9 fuel units in the combustion chamber at once - it will be full. Also, fuel won't be burned, unless you actually move the ship - till then it can be taken out of combustion chamber and returned back to fuel tanks.</p><p>2) Food destruction works only, if the BIOS is set to destroy it on day change. Otherwise, the cooked food will just get slowly spoiled. True, default setting of BIOS to destroy cooked rations on day change, but it's usualy one of the first things humans set off after mush selection. And, well, before mush selection, there's no mush to use this tactics.</p><p>3) It might be night for you in your timezone, but Mush is played all around the world. There's high probability that someone will be active on every cycle. So this makes breaking the oxygen tanks viable only with very low oxygen level. And after that gets down to zero, people die only very slowly of suffocation - 1 person per cycle. Mushes included.</p><p>4) As factoryman mentioned, hacker kit can't be taken to patroller or Pasiphae. So the crew can still try to hack command terminal and abandon you. And there's "ghost mush sample" entry in Xyloph DB so even that might be negated by active comms officer.</p><p>5) Well, you can do that. But again, they can abandon you. And again, don't be so sure that no one is active on your night.</p>

                <p>The thing I wanted to address it's how easy it is to totally destroy the ship without using any mush skills or any strategy if you are not using mush tactics, but using griefer tactic.<br>As i mentioned before, human team can lose all 20 fuel, all food <span class="tid_wspoil">(switch neron settings, and just grind the rations in the microwave on the last minute of cycle 8, whoosh, magic)</span>, around 12 oxy, pashipae + some vital items possibly including mush sample on day 1, right after the selection. And the mush who did that not only alive and well in the safety of the space, but also spent only like 10 ap and some mp for all of this and can extract the spores whenever he wants too on top of this.</p><p>And thanks for input Enigma, but even without oxygen shortage the mush himself can grab 3 capsules + both tanks can leak around 9 if timed correctly, because i doubt that tech's on most of the ship will be active enough in like 2:00 yes, sometimes they will, but mostly not. Also if both mushes commit suicide on patrol ships <span class="tid_wspoil">(preferably leaving third behind, but they can return anytime and take a trip to sol too if timed correctly,)</span>, they can take with them the whooping 15 oxygen, and without any fuel and grown up trees on day 1. There is nothing the crew can do.</p><p>That's all cool, but he is not playing against players here, but against the game. And personally if I would be against the mush who'll use this tactic, I won't be impressed, I would be a bit well, you know... Even though i came up with such a plan myself and it won't be a total surprise to me like for the most other new, semi-new players.</p><p>Once again. This plan does not use.<br>1.) Mush skills<br>2.) Player interaction<br>3.) Team cooperation</p><p>And can't be countered at all in most cases, and even if it does it'll cripple the ship. The thing about hurting you own team is valid actually, but i doubt that it can be used, because desruction of fuel, food and mush sample are actually profitable for any mush, and oxy starvation is actually one of the most common tactics.<br><span class="tid_wspoil">I just want to sleep well on Daedalus, knowing that i won't awake to the sound of "Pashipae radio broadcast" telling me that half of the ship resources are gone in 1 cycle and the only shred of a chance we have is to repair pilgred ASAP and jump to Sol with a hacker kit <span class="tid_strike">if it's still exists</span> with a mush on board.</span></p>

                <p>Again, just some notes</p><p>- microwave has 4 charges, at most. Everything else has to be cooked manually, i.e. using APs.</p><p>- switching Neron settings either means you are an Neron admin or you hack BIOS. The latter might be a pretty intenstive job AP-wise.</p><p>- if you're leaving broken oxygen tanks to just technicians, that's just a bad gameplay on your side. Anyone can try to fix anything. And with oxygen reservoirs the chance of success is not so low, even.</p><p>All in all, there are reasons why we don't see using those tactics by mushes every day. And that reason is they are either not efficient enough, reliable enough, or versatile enough. They are okay to be used, when the circumstances are right, but other time they can be countered and using them is mistake on mush side. And thus there's no reason to ban them or anything.</p>

                <p>Well, thanks for clarifying. There where some mistakes on my side that are making the plan that much harder.

                <p>I'll derail a thread just a little bit more clarifying what i meant to say. <span class="tid_wspoil">Sorry about that i'm going in length here. I had to create a different thread for that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico">.</span><br>I was talking about well, pve way of destroying the ship not pvp. And actually you don't actually need to destroy everything i listed, just a few things. I was corrected a few times, there actually some mechanic in place to remedy this, but not fully.<br>1.) Food - one mush with 2 spores<span class="tid_wspoil"> (he can get 4 i guess and have ap to get into pashie)</span> can cook around 24 rations with microwave if i count right. That makes all food stocks after selection probably so the humans will have around 2 days after this to get to Sol or starve hard especially if you hide\take the bananas and all. That will force humans to try and find the second mush and repair pilg in 2 days or less, or they will lose. It's pretty hard. <span class="tid_wspoil">(especitally hard if food destruction wouldn't be noticed immedtiately)</span><br><span class="tid_wspoil"> (you must be neron admin or Janice should just be a bit slow for it to work)</span><br>2.) Fuel - you can exaust 18 fuel in 2 cycles if you are a commander <span class="tid_wspoil">(or harder with hacker)</span>. It won't cost much ap and can be done fast. If there is noone who can stop you in 2 cycles and 2 fuel was already spent. The tank is empty and they can't even leave you and you are perfectly safe (<span class="tid_wspoil">well almost there is oxy trick that won't work if you have oxy capsule yourself and maybe hunters too, also trader can come... and you'll shoot it from patrol)</span> in the pashie\patrol after that.<br>3.) Oxy - if you are safe in the pashie (see 2.) you can break oxy tanks each day for fun and nothing can stop you. Also if you manage to break tanks few times after day 1 and grab some capsules most of the time it will be enough to kill ill organized ship. Especially if they forced to jump to leave\magnet you and not astroscan.<br>4.) Hacker - If you managed to hide well\give to a teammate\lose hacker kit and you are commander, there is nothing the crew can do to you in the pashipae, and you can terrorise them all you want, with oxy tanks destroying as easiest strategy.</p><p>Well something like this. It's more like guidlenes for mush <span class="tid_wspoil">that are not meant to be in this thread</span> but still my opinion that doing one of this things greatly improves mush chances in most cases. Because you are using one of you members as a resourse to keep whole crew busy, while second mush get all the chances it wants, even if the crew somehow manage to survive the above. It can get absurd if there x3 mushes, and even worse with sleeping mush i guess.<br>And what I wanted to say is if anything of the above goes "meta", the fun will be ruined hard for everyone. Well i'm new here, but already seen enough examples of how mush in the pashie can ruin a game by itself, but if he actually knows what he is doing and prepared for it from the start, then for most random ships it's a game over.<br>Most of the mashes tend to avoid the partoller trick even if they know about it, so i guessed, maybe there is some unspoken rule about it except the "partyruiner" kind of rule.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">Excuse me for my blathering I have nothing better to do.</span></p>
