                <p>I read on forums that it is possible to secure weapons somehow, but we didn`t secure weapons on any of my ships and mushes were easily able to grab blaster. How is it possible to secure weapons? Of course Chun can take it but her inventory is very limited. Or should we give weapons to random/certain crew members before msuh selection to reduce chances of mushes getting them?</p>

                <p>Giving the hacker kit to Jin Su means that if he's Mush (or a griefer) and purposely <em>not</em> moving the ship, you have to kill him. It just limits your options to dealing with the situation. The hacker kit is also useful for emergency moves when the commander isn't online. And since he goes on expeditions for the same reason the kit is secured in the first place, giving it to him risks losing it entirely.</p><p>In general, Chun should be the one holding or hiding things until people are deemed trustworthy. Even then, who actually has it should be kept on the down-low to prevent rushing the knife-holder to let your mush buddy grab the weapon when it's dropped. It also makes for nasty surprises if a rampage is planned. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>For neutral play purposes, things can not be hidden before the mush are selected, but you can find out where things are. If you are somebody who has a right to a weapon by character (ie Chao, Derek, Jin Su), you could justify grabbing one during the neutral period because you're not taking it in case you are a mush or taking it so mush don't get it. You're taking it because you want it and it's reasonable for your character to have it.</p>

As picking them up alone is no "illegal" move you had to pick them up to move them where ever you're keeping them aswell after all. Plus some people just don't feel save with all weapons and potential victims in one dorm. Camera or not make no difference if a mush grabs the Grenade and proceeds killing the present people with all the other goodies you brought them.</p>

As picking them up alone is no "illegal" move you had to pick them up to move them where ever you're keeping them aswell after all. Plus some people just don't feel save with all weapons and potential victims in one dorm. Camera or not make no difference if a mush grabs the Grenade and proceeds killing the present people with all the other goodies you brought them.</cite><p>Yes, sorry, poor choice of words I suppose. There is always a risk, but at least with the cameras it makes it less likely to risk early exposure. It also make the other crew feel better when they can openly see their location. People early on are always scanning and are on guard, so somebody taking a weapon in front of your eyes can work both ways. If you have alert humans, they will react fast to an action like this. It will be considered hostile immediately. After things settle down, groups will form and will openly announce intentions to grant some weapons to be hidden by a trusted party. If I'm laying in a bed, it's easier to see a "pick up" instead of someone leaving the room and you wander where they went, what they did. You need to decide if you want to go track them or not. If you are not Eleesha, it's a huge pain to find out efficiently where they went.</p>

Letting Chun be exempt from neutral play would be invalidating the whole concept of neutral play!</p></cite><p>Moving the Apron to the Lab gives an advantage to the humans. (MUSH can't hide it now.)<br>Shooting hunters gives an advantage to the humans. And not shooting them would give an advantage to the MUSH. (No reason to want the hull to be higher.

If they are human, they know where stuff is, and same with being a MUSH. (How's that different that Derek holding a blaster? It helps whatever team he's on.

(Chun versus two MUSH.)<br>And while you can say that Chun holding the grenade gives the humans more of advantage than her not holding it, you'd be wrong. Chun holding the grenade means that the MUSH either have to kill her for it, or work on a different plan.<br>On the other hand, if the MUSH get the grenade (and make a second one if there is a BP) then they can rampage and having a grenade go off can take out about 3 people. (And one is usually Janice since she's in the Dorms most of the time.) There isn't a way to avoid that once the MUSH get the grenade.<br>Chun holding the grenade is a 100% smaller advantage for the humans. Her not holding it is a 1/8 chance of a huge advantage for the MUSH.</p>

                <p>If we must stay true to lore, or story or whatever you wanna call it, holding back in the beginning is lame in my opinion. Because when you wake up, everyone is human. The 2 that "get infected" after full crew compliment wakes up can actually take advantage of helping around and establishing themselves as ""Active and Caring"" . Pretending to be inactive and holding back is bad in 2 ways. If you turn out to be human, your human buddies are effectively behind. If you turn out to be one of the infected, your inactivity and/or sudden activity after the fact can easily make you out as a possible suspect. I deeply dislike any lazy crew mates, regardless of them being mush or not. They are usually the first to go if direct investigation hits a brick wall.</p>

And ofc I do nothing to help Chun get them. I will not work on any research or projects (maybe lenses, as they can give me 80% accuracy with blasters or minigun in future).

I will not take any skills that give passive bonuses to humans like NERON Only Friend or Paranoid. If I get dirty from anything - I will not wash until mush selection. And so on.</p><p>And I really don't like when my mush partner acts like SmirnoffPete. It's so common - mush selection happen on C7-C8, but my partner already spent his ap to get humans projects or scraps, and now he does not have ap to make spores before day change (even if he has perfect excuse to be dirty).

A very good way to make yourself suspicious right from the beginning of the game, especially if you ignore to wash yourself when people want you to wash before mush selection. Even if it turns out that you are a human - the humans will probably watch you closer and kill you more likely. Actually the same with pilgred --&gt; i am instantly warned that a pilgred rush is your goal if you are a mush.</p>

                <p>Kyubey, if I turn out to be mush, I never go for a "rampage" or *PILGRED Reactor" rush. Or ship destruction on day 1-2. Those are last resort for me. So if I actually was nice, friendly and active from the start, it's super easy to use that as excuse to regain AP's and lay low to observe what happens. Not to mention, much easier to get on their trusted side if you are a polite helpful crew member. Not telling you are wrong, there are many ways to do this, you can actually accomplish both things. Save AP for Spores and still be friendly and helpful. About the skills, Yes I agree, I too wait for after infection before choosing them. [ there is one more trick, I'll share, on the main page, before going on a ship, click on replay Tutorial, that will make you look like a new player and will give you bonus AP/MP when you run out!!! ] ..... should've kept that to myself lol.. oh well. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I don't say anything about PILGRED rush or rampage are the only opnions - having ap, knowing where are not secured items and so on can be used for a lot of tasks. Or about you should be angry or rude. You can got from cryo and say absolutely nothing. You can even stay in lab. Or you can do a few favores that don't cost you much ap like moving few expo items, you can chat a lot and be nice, help new players and so on, but don't do anything yet.</p><p>Maybe my last message was a bit too rude, but ofc I don't say, "I will keep all my ap for mush selection and take bed as well to bring pain and destruction if I happen to be mush". I'm totally agree about:</p><p><cite>Not telling you are wrong, there are many ways to do this, you can actually accomplish both things. Save AP for Spores and still be friendly and helpful. </cite></p><p>For example once my partner was Janice with IT expert and Shrink. She saved her ap, got even it to 12 from cycle changes in bed. She went to nexus, switched settings as always, opened the terminal, worked on project team decided (it was ~60% already, they began to work on it before selection). Then she did 2 spores (4ap) made a trap (5ap), did one more spore (7ap), went back to dorm, took shower (9). Kuan Ti came, got trap, left nexus said about reset. Janice returned, reset, trapped it again (10ap), asked Kuan to come to finish it with her - she wanted to finish it before going to sleep. Kuan came, was spiked (11ap) and got trap. Janice took anonymush. They finished the project.</p><p>It was just an example from the game btw, ofc he could avoid it. It just showes, that keeping ap can be used on lots of things, not just rushes.</p>

                <p>The thing people forget about is the fact that the ship is already having problems before Mush selection. I've joined games where its already Day 2 Cycle X and the hull is at 75 already. Generally in pub games humans already have a hard time with late starts, super inactive players, and newbs/griefers doing all sorts of weird stuff. Its become common place for me to join around Cycle 2-3 game time because that's the best chance of joining an early day 1 ship.</p><p>Plus with the new rules you can't research any Mush tech immediately either. And IMO good Mush don't "suicide by items" early. Its usually REALLY easy to see who has hidden thing immediately and the other option is to grab some key items and make for a ship if you are a pilot. Both of those are painful but don't really put the humans out, and once they've nailed the Mush and everyone is cooperating like made the game is SO MUCH easier for humans.</p><p>So at the start of the game I usually don't hold back as a human, most ships I've been on either barely make it back to Sol, or fall apart thanks to key inactives/idiots (JS, Janice, researchers). Certainly when I turn Mush I know I've hurt myself a bit, but I'm pretty confident that people will screw up, go inactive, make mistakes. Half the time I don't even spore anymore with Green Jelly and Slimetrap and just playing normal Human.</p><p>I've never played a casting game or MMM game so I might change my tune if I was guaranteed that 95% of the players were going to be super active and actually knew what they were doing. If that was the case I might abide by those Neutral Play rules until everyone was on the ship, but basic ship maintenance shouldn't be ignored (broken stuff, Hunters, etc)</p>

The real concern is if you take something (weapon, apron, etc), you don't say anything, and you become Mush, you suddenly give the Mush a huge advantage. You can't use the fact you're more likely human than Mush to justify risking giving the Mush a clear advantage.</p>

                <p>Before there is any continued discussion about neutral play, let just remind you why it exists in the first place:<br>Before the update, it was possible for humans to research one or more researches before Mush were even selected, crippling the Mush before the game even starts. Also, this rule was made during a time when it could take a day or so to fill up a ship, and it was mainly a way to preserve fairness for a normal ship that is taking days to fill or for MMM or MMM-like ships. It was also possible for someone to hide important items just in case they became Mush. Now that both issues have been addressed by the devs, this is a rule that will most likely not affect anyone since it's now very subjective what is neutral and what isn't. Holding onto important items is still a bit of a problem since you're now forcing the human crew to either wait to get the item back when needed or kill someone for it or forcing a ship-wide search if the Mush manage to immediately hide the items they were carrying 'just in case'.</p>
