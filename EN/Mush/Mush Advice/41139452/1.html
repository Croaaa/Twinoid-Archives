                <p>I finally have a rather active ship (only 3 days and most of the people on the ship do something each day) and I've never reached Eden. It seems usually impossible to be honest, etc going to oxygen planet then no oxygen, too risk and what not. Most ships I go on do not go on expeditions often, if at all, really. I guess that's for the rebel bases, but I wanted a few strategies for getting to Eden (Who to take on expeditions, what to bring, etc.) I know the zones, but it is often very hard to coordinate a ship to do anything.</p>

                <p>become the supreme leader - tell people what to do and when.<br>for example tell frieda and kuan to scan planets for star map zones and tell people to get their asses to the expedition.<br>of course all of this is easier if you are jin su (born leader, pilot and the commander) but its also possible to do with any character all you have to do is take charge if you have a kind of active ship.<br>of course if someone else is coordinating everything and making stuff happen perfectly you can just enjoy the ride and hope you get lucky with starmap pieces.</p>

                <p>It's mostly a matter of luck. Currently I'm on a ship that's had 7 cristalite expos. 1 starmap fragment, 1 MIA, 5 mush traps. That being said, cristalite is the only artifact zone that is guaranteed to give a starmap fragment if you get the good outcome, other artifact zones (Intelligent life, caverns, shipwrecks, ruins) randomly choose between all of the alien artifacts, making the chances of getting a starmap fragment exceptionally low. Also, cristalite zones <em>do</em> have a chance of combat, so a diplomat is very important to bring along.</p><p>Apart from that just hope RNG is in your favor and work together with the crew to keep everyone alive, O2 tanks repaired, and the hull from being destroyed. There's no set strategy for finding starmap fragments simply because there's too much RNG involved. Just prioritize cristalite planets (with no insta-death zones) and hope for best. Oh, and don't forget a compass either, there's a chance of MIA in cristalite.</p>

                <p>I would say the single most important thing in going to Eden is having a diplomat who can go on expeditions. Eden without one can happen, but is very rare and entirely luck dependent. So find out when your diplomat is like to be around and make sure expeditions are scheduled then, and make sure your diplomat gets the compass.</p><p>Other than that it really is all about luck in finding the right planets and getting the lucky outcomes. Taking a babel module to planets with intelligent life will increase this chance a bit. So expedition as much as possible to those artifact/cristalite zones and hope the RNG is kind.</p>

                <p>There are so many factors that helps one get to Eden, some beyond our control (RNG mainly), and some others within our control. The ones you have control over:</p><p><em>1. Motivate your crew!</em> Make sure they're excited about Eden, and make sure they know that they have to work hard for that reward. Keep them amused with jokes. Move them with a sentimental story about the Eden dream. Give them a reason to log in more often.</p><p><em>2. Make sure your dedicated planet scanners get all the support they need!</em> Feed them when they need food. Heal them when they get hurt. These scanners have one job only: find a safe-ish planet with Cristalite and/or 3x Intelligent Life. Until they find them, they shouldn't use their APs putting out fires others can.</p><p><em>3. Protect your Diplomat/Polyvalent!</em> Not only they double your chances of going to Eden by improving the starmap piece odds, they also reduce the amount of damage your expedition crew receives rather significantly. That means less healing, and less deaths. Make sure they always have a Compass, and never go to expedition with less than near-full HP.</p><p><em>4. Keep your useful crew alive!</em> After Day 10, the ship will start raining steel plates on your crew, and you'll have to start keeping people healed up every cycle or risk losing them to the wretched ceiling. Your active crew is your greatest resource. If you let them die because it's "too wasteful" to heal someone with 11 HP, I promise you you'll lose a lot more when they die.</p><p><em>5. Efficiency helps!</em> Try to organise your crew to be AP efficient such that you can do 1-2 expeditions a day. When luck is cruel to you, you just have to be even more efficient to counter it.</p>

                <p>I really agree with most of Sagittaeri's list, with only a couple of exceptions: the importance of having a LOT of planet scanners, (not necessarily dedicated scanners at all, unless you consider most surviving non-pilots to be dedicated scanners) , and the importance of not doing a 'lot' of expos, instead just a few 'high odds of starmap' ones.</p><p>The efficiency that dedicated planet scanners get is not that much better than the non astro folks; I prefer to see, once research, projects, and Pilgred are all essentially finished, <em>everyone except pilots or other still-needed essential specialists</em> become something of a jack of all trades - those trades being keep the ship alive, keep each other alive, keep the plants productive, and save up AP for scanning.<br> <br>I completely disagree with the idea of doing 1-2 expos a day. Unless you have the luck of finding 1-2 perfect planets a day... Perfect being safe cristalite planets. Expos are incredibly AP intensive. The AP/moves to load fuel, turn ship, move ship, heal before expo, move to IB, heal after expo, possibly launch second expos, possibly have a death or vital item loss, load fuel, and leave.... Expos are extremely expensive. If you have a high chance to find a starmap on that planet, great. But what is a high chance?</p><p>It's only crystalite which offers an approximate 50% chance of starmap. When you find an artifact there's approximately a 5% chance that artifact will be a starmap. But even the highest artifact chance zone, intelligent life with babel module and diplomat, the chance of getting an artifact is 80%; so that 'great' zone has only a 4% chance to give a starmap. A planet with 3 intelligent life zones, given expo team has babel and diplomat, that 3 int life planet offers an 11.5% chance to find one or more starmaps. To me that's still a low chance planet, the odds of getting starmaps is higher per AP and cycle spent to just search for cystalite instead and limit expos to that sort of planet.</p><p>The ship's I've been on that have reached Eden, none of them have done 1-2 expos a day. The only ships who could possibly do 1-2 expos a day are ships lucky enough to have at least 5 highly active players and at least another 4 fairly active ones.... that is needed to coordinate the expo and afford the cost of the expo and still keep ship, players, and plants alive. Most ships do not seem to have that much high activity, so corners have to be cut - those corners are the extra expos. Most expos do not lead to Eden. Conversely.... you do not usually need many expos to reach Eden. I have been to Eden twice on random ships, ships filled with the usual wide range of activity levels, meaning not so highly active.</p><p>Be picky in doing expos, because they cost so much. Make sure the possible rewards are worth the true and full cost of your ship's ability to do them, and include the expected real number of cycles it will take to do, if your crew cannot gather immediately after moving and leave orbit immediately too. If the planet has less than a 50% chance of a starmap, and you need starmaps... your ship's AP is best spent on scanning, not low-odds-of-starmap-but-costly expos; then being picky about the planets good enough to visit.</p>

Sure, if RNG is kind we don't have to work as hard. But what if RNG is cruel? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>My current ship has just gone to 7 Cristalite zone, where the first 6 gave us mush traps. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> We are very close to the dreaded Day 18 and we're not letting up. We know that pretty soon, we'll be too busy healing people to actually do expos, then our chances of Eden will plummet. That's the reason I sometimes push for efficiency, where we do one Cristalite expo a day at minimum...if we have the crew for it. Yes, sometimes scanning RNG can be cruel too, and if that happens we delay the expo.</p><p>Doing lots of expos are very expensive, it's true. With any luck, we'll get some pretty good returns, though, like alien artefacts and steaks, which help mitigate the AP cost. When necessary I'll even feed rations to my planet scanners to rush a cristalite planet scan.</p><p>So, to clarify my point, when RNG is bad, we work harder to compensate for it. And we do this by being more efficient. Or, you can wait for a lucky ship. It'll eventually come if you pay long enough. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
