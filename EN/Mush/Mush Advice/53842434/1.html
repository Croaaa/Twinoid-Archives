                <p>Hello all!</p><p>I've trawled the forums, and haven't seen much discussion about the wonderful little tool known as the Mage Book, so I've written up a little list with who I believe should receive the books your ship has. If you disagree, let's discuss it! I'm open to change this list if you think I've erred in my judgement.</p><p>MAGE BOOK PRIORITY LIST</p><p>Clauses:</p><p><em>1</em> If they do not naturally take this skill.<br><em>2</em> If the above option(s) are/is deceased/inactive.<br><em>3</em> On seasons that feature said character.<br><em>4</em> Who has finished their regular duties.</p><br><p><strong>Astrophysicist</strong><br>1. Jin Su<br>2. Gioele<em>1</em>/Stephen<em>2</em><br>3. Paola<em>4</em><br>4. Any Generalist<br>5. Anyone<em>4</em><br>Having the Commander take this job is very effective, allowing them to scan a planet, and move to it on more or less the same cycle hence Jin Su, Gioele and Stephen holding such high scoring spots on this list, the only exception is Chao, whose Hyperactive trait makes him a poor candidate for the job. Paola is an option for it if the bases are decoded and Xyloph is completed, as it will give her a new job, as well as keeping the Comms Manager on the bridge to trade with aliens.<br>Lastly, anyone can do this job, it's pretty open ended, but make sure it's not someone with an AP intensive task like Technicians or Pilots.</p><br><p><strong>Biologist</strong><br>1. Andie<em>3</em><br>2. Chun<br>3. Finola<em>13</em><br>4. Generalists<br>Biologist is one of the Mage books that doesn't have a lot of valid recipients, Chun and Andie can both get a boost to their research ability from it, and Finola can use it as well if she chose Nurse over it.<br>Otherwise, just dump it on a Generalist.</p><p><strong>Botanist</strong><br>1. Generalists<br>2. Chao<br>3. Chun<br>4. Ian<em>1</em><br>Botanist is a skill that requires attendance on cycle 8, as such it should be given to a generalist who can be online at the time, even Chao is an option because of the free actions given by Botanist, but he is not preferable to the others. Chun can make use of it as well, as she is usually in the Laboratory already, lastly, an Ian who took Green Thumb over Botanist makes another candidate for it.</p><p><strong>Chef</strong><br>1. Hua<br>2. Jin Su<br>3. Chun<br>4. Ian<br>5. Andie<em>3</em><br>Chef is the one skill book that is guaranteed to turn up on your ship, which is nice, but the skill itself is rather weak. The best use for this skill is to Superfreeze any Alien Steaks that were collected on an expeditions, as such it should go to either of the two people who are usually on them; Hua or Jin Su, barring that, Chun makes an excellent recipient due to her inability to be Mush, therein she can always be trusted to bring you spore-free food. Ian is another option [though not as strong as Hua] for an expedition regular, and Andie can also be given it for similar reasons, though there are plenty of other Mage Books that suite Andie better.</p><p><strong>Diplomat</strong><br>1. Hua<br>2. Paola<br>3. Jin Su<br>4. Generalists/Ian<br>5. Janice<em>1</em><br>There are not many contenders for Diplomat, as most characters do not go on expeditions, the best options are Hua who is perfectly equipped for such missions, or Paola, who can use it to get better trade options. Jin Su is an option, due to his need to attend all expeditions until the Mush have become defunct. Generalists who attend expeditions as filler are an option as well as Ian who attends expos regularly.<br>Lastly, a Janice who lacks the skill may take it to attend expeditions for her personal Glory objective.</p><p><strong>Firefighter</strong><br>1. Eleesha<br>2. Chao<em>3</em><br>3. Generalists<br>4. Roland<em>1</em><br>Firefighter is a skill for people who are actively roaming the ship, as such, Eleesha who should always have the Scooter and Chao with his Hyperactive trait make excellent candidates, as they <em>are</em> always scouting the ship for suspicious activity.<br>Barring those two, any Generalist can make use of it, and with his Sprinter ability; Roland can too, but make sure there are enough pilots before letting him have it.</p><p><strong>IT Expert</strong><br>1. Paola<br>2. Finola<em>3</em>/Kuan Ti<br>3. Freida<em>1</em><br>4. Chun/Ian<br>5. Raluca/Hua (Technician)<br>Due to the high AP demand associated with Comms manager IT Expert can supplement Paola instead of rations.<br>Alternatively, Finola or Kuan Ti could take it to get even better at Research and NERON Projects respectively.<br>Freida could always use more AP for scanning planets, so she is a decent candidate as well.<br>Chun and Ian can both contribute to research with this skill, Ian will be able to relay even if he spent all his AP maintaining his 8 Banana plants and Chun can provide relays beyond what she usually can.<br>Finally, Raluca or Hua with Technician could take this skill to further their ability to assist with NERON projects, as Hua is strapped for AP to begin with as a pilot, this allows her to make the most of her skillset, and Raluca with Physicist and Tech becomes even more potent.</p><p><strong>Logistics Expert</strong><br>1. Paola<em>1</em><br>2. Freida<br>3. Chun<br>4. Andie/Finola<br>5. Ian<br>6. Anyone<br>The best option for Logistics Expert is to power up Paola by giving it to Freida, but should Paola lack it to begin with, she should get it so that Freida doesn't run low on AP for planet scanning.<br>Otherwise, Chun is a good option assuming there isn't a medic book, as she can take the skill then sleep in Medlab with Ian or Finola/Andie idling there gaining AP from it.<br>For similar reasons, Finola/Andie or Ian can take the skill then give the benefit of it to a Chun who is standing in Medlab.<br>With all other characters, randomness is a bit to heavily involved, but it is still better used than not.</p><p>[Part 1]</p>

                <p>[Part 2]</p><p><strong>Medic</strong><br>1. Chun<br>2. Ian<br>3. Finola<em>1</em>/Andie<br>4. Paola<em>4</em><br>5. Janice<br>Medic is one of the more powerful abilities bestowed by Mage Books, Chun's reason for wanting it are three-fold, excellent sync with the Nurse skill, the fact that she is guaranteed to be Human, therein, you would not be “wasting” the book on a Mush and lastly that she is a researcher without Biologist or Medic to begin with. Ian is the second best option with the ability syncing well with his Biologist or Mycologist skills. A Finola lacking Medic or Andie can take this one for a buff to their research power. Paola with her jobs complete is another option with the powerful Medic/Biologist sync. Finally, Janice who has taken IT Expert/Diplomat is another option, as IT Experts free abilities apply to researching as well and Diplomats attend most Expeditions, and could be helpful healing the team upon return.</p><p><strong>Pilot</strong><br>1. Stephen<br>2. Derek<em>3</em><br>3. Roland<em>1</em><br>4. Hua<em>1</em><br>5. Jin Su<em>1</em><br>6. Chao<em>3</em>/Paola<em>4</em><br>Pilot, the one skill that stops the ship exploding by prevention rather than repair. There are a three people per ship who don't receive this skill but are given the Shooter skill in it's place, Stephen everyone's favourite stowaway chef is a prime example of this, and if he doesn't have access to Apprentice, he should be high in the running to take the book.<br>Derek is another potential Generalist with Shooter who could “graduate” into pilothood, he is tiered lower than Stephen due to him being a prime transfer target already, but should the Mush have been dealt with, he can become a fantastic Pilot.<br>Roland, Hua and Jin Su are all people who naturally have Pilot, but may not take it due to level restrictions or need of other roles, should they not have it, consider giving it to them.<br>Chao is an option, but not the best; as Hyperactive prevents him from regenerating AP properly, should you be out of options, consider him before Janice or Kuan Ti simply because he get's free shooter points.</p><p><strong>Radio Expert</strong><br>1. Paola<em>1</em><br>2. Freida<em>1</em>/Eleesha<em>2</em> <br>3. Gioele (With Astrophysicist)<br>4. Jin Su<br>5. Janice/Finola/Andie<em>3</em> (With Diplomat or Polyvalent)<br>6. Any Generalist<br>This ability is most useful in the hands of people who frequent the bridge, as Paola and Freida live there, Eleesha is a viable option because of her place in the Comms Manager hierarchy, Jin Su and Gioele (with Astrophysicist) are also there frequently, The Diplomats are viable because of their usefulness in making trades with aliens. Lastly, Generalists are always an option for “Junk books.”<br>A Paola who has finished her main objective is usually looking for a new job, Pilot is an option if she isn't Gunner.</p><p><strong>Robotics Expert</strong><br>1. Generalists<br>2. Terrence<em>1</em><br>3. Eleesha<em>4</em><br>Robotics Expert is helpful in that it gives a free drone blueprint upon being read, as such, it should be read early on. Stephen, Gioele or Derek make excellent candidates for it as they lack set jobs and building those pesky drones can be quite AP intensive.<br>Returning the ability to perform upgrades to Terrence is an obvious choice.<br>You could also give it to an Eleesha who has finished the Mush Hunt.</p><p><strong>Shooter</strong><br>1. Hua<br>2. Andie<em>3</em>/Freida<br>3. Roland<em>1</em><br>4. Terrence<em>1</em><br>5. Paola<em>1</em> (Gunner)<br>6. Jin Su<em>1</em><br>This is an easy one, Shooter is really only useful to Pilots, and 50% of Pilots get the skill naturally, this book will almost always go to Hua assuming she is a functioning Human, if she isn't however, it could be used to turn Andie or Freida into a decent dogfighter. Occasionally a Pilot may not be able to take Shooter, eg; Bronze Roland, so the book can also supplement them. Paola with Gunner can make good use of the skill as well.</p><p><strong>Shrink</strong><br>1. Chao<em>3</em><br>2. Stephen<br>3. Gioele<br>4. Eleesha<em>4</em><br>5. Derek<em>3</em><br>Shrink is a bit of a curve-ball skill, whilst incredibly helpful, it can also be a bit of a resource drain on anyone with an existing job, hence why Generalists make up the entirety of this list.<br>Chao sits at the number one spot due to the nature of his Hyperactivity trait, being unable to lie down, but still wanting the protection of the camera means he will more often than not be in the Dorms anyway, and able to give the passive Shrink bonus to more people than any other character could.<br>Stephen is above Gioele because Gio is better for more AP intensive tasks because of his Caffeine addict ability.<br>Eleesha is usually in need of a new job after finishing off the Mush, so barring her having Technician, Shrink is a good option.<br>Derek sits low here because he is already a major transfer target, adding the ability to take out a Shrink with their rampage may just cause the Mushrooms to act, but if they are dealt with already; it's an acceptable option.</p><p><strong>Sprinter</strong><br>1. Derek<em>3</em>/Ian<br>2. Terrence<br>3. Eleesha/any Technician<br>4. Anyone<br>Sprinter isn't the most useful of books, in-fact, it is probably the most useless of all of them, but Firefighters Derek and Ian can get some use out of it, and an Eleesha could drop the Scooter in a dorm for communal use if she took this skill any Technician could use this skill whilst hunting down breakages aboard the Daedalus also. Terrence could take it to completely counter the AP/MP conversion issues that arise with his handicapped trait.<br>Anyone who regularly attends expeditions could take it to help on them too.</p><p><strong>Technician</strong><br>1. Generalists<br>2. Anyone<em>4</em><br>3. Kuan Ti<em>1</em><br>4. Raluca<em>1</em><br>5. Eleesha<em>1</em><br>Technician is a powerful skill and Generalists like Gioele and Stephen can do a lot with it, but really, anyone who has finished there job can make use of it. It could also be used to give the skill to a character who usually has it but neglected or was unable to take it, Kuan Ti and Raluca being common examples of this.<br>Eleesha can make a decent Technician once the Mush Hunt is concluded, but as she is usually not a level 5, she doesn't typically have access to it naturally.</p><br><p>So, what did you think? Disagree with the order here? Let me know! I'm open to discussion about the tiering of characters on the many lists of this post.</p>

                <p>Mage books priority depends way too much on the skills situation to be explained once and for all. If Jin Su is one of 2 or 3 pilots, which indeed happens, then obviously his priority on Astro book is the lowest, and the Shooter one should be more high.<br>But you covered a lot with these clauses and explanations, so it's an interesting work of analysis and summing things up. I'm with Patches in the sense that the crew has to first turn their own brains on while choosing something, rather than depending on pre-made sheets. But a sheet like this can help in case the decision maker is overlooking something; like a source of a fresh idea. Ideally, the fresh ideas should be generated by the fellow crewmembers in a tight discussions, but we all know how ideal is rare <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I agree with Patches and Everlasting. There are some obvious choices (Medic or Biologist, Chef book for someone who often goes on expos, Shooter primarily for a pilot...) but the others are much too situational. They depend on the crew, their other skills, the situation of the ship... For instance, Chao can become a pilot if he is active and if he has access to Logistics.</p><p>I'm not going to go into details about all the magebooks, but I mainly disagree about your choices for Astro. Jin Su usually has a lot on his plate (piloting, missions, speeches, moving the ship, expos... depending on his skills, of course). On the other hand, IT Experts such as Eleesha or Janice have IT points, which is a nice bonus for an astro.</p><p>If you want the book to be used, then insist regularly until they are used, and try to debate with your crew about who should use what book. Or you can even make the decision yourself and assign books to your crew members. It usually works.</p>

                <p>I disagree with a lot on this list. I appreciate the effort that went into it, certainly, and I would also note that any decision regarding who gets a mage book also needs to heavily take into account the activity level of the player, and the player's ability to competently and efficiently perform the duties required by the skill gained, and are further complicated by the tremendous variation in circumstances present on different ships. That said, your open invitation to discuss is one I'll participate in:<br> <br>Astrophysicist:<br>Jin Su, already being a Pilot/Leader, is not a good candidate for this job, as the AP intensity of Astrophysics is too high to allow him to perform all three jobs along with moving the ship with any respectable efficiency. Eleesha with IT Expert should top this list, rivalled only by a Caffeine Junkie Gioele who did not also take Astrophysicist.<br> <br>Biologist:<br>Does Biologist stack with Polyvalent? I thought Polyvalent already included the bonus of Biologist, but hey, if it works, it works. Chun should probably be highest on this list as if you start with the Biologist book, nobody should have any issues with turning Chun into a researcher.</p><p>Botanist:<br>I agree with your general assessments here.</p><p>Chef:<br>I agree with your general assessments here. Anyone who can reliably get the job done when it comes to freezing steaks is a great candidate, and more often than not it seems to be that the best candidate is the one person that shows any interest in reading the Chef book at all.</p><p>Diplomat:<br>I disagree with Paola reading this book just to unlock trade options unless you either have enough other Diplomats whose activity ensures that one will be attending nearly every expedition, or Paola will be filling those shoes herself. If your ship is designed with a Paola/Frieda bridge team, Frieda can unlock the trade options just as well and as a pilot/survivalist, is more likely to attend expeditions than Paola.</p><p>Firefighter:<br>For me, what is more important is who is going to be available to deal with the bulk of fires when they need to be dealt with than any synergy with existing skills, especially considering that anyone can use the scooter to be equal to a sprinter and more effective than a hyperactive Chao. Perhaps greater attention to synergies should be made if Fire Detector is lost and general ship activity is not high enough for there to be separate fire seekers and fire fighters.</p><p>IT Expert:<br>In my opinion, Frieda should be number 2 on this list and Chun should be dropped off of it entirely. Chun has zero skills allowing her to be effective at Research or NERON Projects, so there should hopefully be somebody better suited for this skill.</p><p>Logistics Expert:<br>Everyone except for Raluca is a fair candidate for this skill, and it's unique in that its effectiveness is limited only by the imagination of what you can accomplish with the game's puzzle of actual logistics. Straying from tradition tends to provide better results under peculiar circumstances. Logistics on Gioele allows someone (even a pilot) to join him in the Refectory when both of their activity levels are such that they can together ensure all coffees get pulled every cycle. Someone in medlab giving the benefit of logistics to a Lethargic Chun would give a sufficiently active Chun 3-4 AP per cycle up to a maximum of 24-26 total AP. Both examples are further enhanced when the person with Logistics is allocated a sofa to use for themselves. There are probably many more effective uses which really depend on circumstances, activity, skills, and resources.</p><p>Medic:<br>I agree with the general assessment here, but let's not forget Eleesha can also achieve IT Expert, and can probably make more efficient use of the healing properties of the skill. If everyone on board the ship can help tend to people's HP, but only Janice can reliably tend to people's Morale, then it is better for Janice to remain specialized in that regard, generally. (I do disagree with your notion that Chun is a researcher without research skills. She is a top candidate for becoming a researcher with a biologist or Medic mage book, but she is not a researcher, she is a test subject. Many people try to play her as if she was a researcher, but her skill-set is suited for something else entirely, and it would better serve the ship to perform those functions if research skills are not available).</p><p>Pilot:<br>Generally, I agree. Ultimately the book should be given to whoever can most effectively get the job done, even if that means giving it to a competent and active Raluca who is managing to get 2 AP per cycle by sleeping in a room with a Shrink. All else equal I would give Chao's shooter points less credit then you seem to since they're not nearly as effective as laying in a bed and spending AP to fire a shot. Shooter points save 2 AP per 8 cycles, when laying in a bed would get you 6 more shots over the same period of time, making Janice or Kuan Ti simply a more effective Pilot.</p><p>Radio Expert:<br>This is easily the worst skill of them all. Did Paola opt for more useful skills when she selected them? Give it to her. Did someone else take over comms? Give it to them. Who idles on the Bridge? Give it to them. Radio Expert doesn't help when making trades with aliens unless you habitually find yourselves needing to connect to Sol before making the trade, in which case Paola is already on the Bridge with Logistics and she should read the book, or somebody on the Bridge with Paola because she has Logistics already should read the book over a Diplomat.</p><p>Robotics Expert:<br>I agree with your asessment of who should read the book, but I see no reason that it should be read early on. It should be read later, after Mush are dealt with and when scrap is available to devote to building and upgrading drones. An extra drone is not very necessary or useful early on.</p><p>Shooter:<br>Yes, this is an easy one. Give it to an active and effective Pilot, or a Gunner Paola. If none of those are options, and your team does not have a diplomat, give it to someone who actively joins expeditions.</p><p>Shrink:<br>In late stages of the game, Shrink actually can be an AP intensive job which requires careful monitoring and planning cycle to cycle. Furthermore, a Shrink who takes a bed with two people and comforts with 2 AP is mathematically producing more Morale than a Shrink who stands over three people and spends 1 AP comforting (6 morale given in the first example, and 5 morale given in the latter). While Chao can often pull off being a sufficient Shrink for the purposes of a given ship, especially if there is another active Shrink or two, I cringe at the thought that he is best for the job.</p><p>Sprinter:<br>Underrated and far from useless, essentially provides a second (albeit permanently attached to one character) scooter to the crew. Many potential candidates. Consider Hua, who when dealing with plants, being a technician, as well as a Pilot, often finds herself running all over the ship to get her jobs done. It even provides for a synergy with the U-Turn skill, allowing you to effectively eliminate the double-edged sword that is Sprinter on expeditions and turn it into a pure positive. Similar with Kuan Ti as a designer/astro/tech/leader as far as someone who regularly walks all over the ship. They're not the only ones who regularly partake in far treks around the Daedalus. It is interesting to note that Terrence or Chao can both never utilize Sprinter to its fullest potential.</p><p>Technician:<br>Great book. If someone (Eleesha or Hua) has Determined, they should get this book. Otherwise, anyone who can effectively get the job done should get this book. Too dirty for Finola.</p>

The best use for this skill is to Superfreeze any Alien Steaks that were collected on an expeditions, as such it should go to either of the two people who are usually on them; Hua or Jin Su, barring that, Chun makes an excellent recipient due to her inability to be Mush, therein she can always be trusted to bring you spore-free food. Ian is another option [though not as strong as Hua] for an expedition regular, and Andie can also be given it for similar reasons, though there are plenty of other Mage Books that suite Andie better.</cite>Again: <em>Diplomat!</em> Those are basically on every expedition, which allows them to freeze the steaks.

Janice<em>1</em><br>There are not many contenders for Diplomat, as most characters do not go on expeditions, the best options are Hua who is perfectly equipped for such missions, or Paola, who can use it to get better trade options. Jin Su is an option, due to his need to attend all expeditions until the Mush have become defunct. Generalists who attend expeditions as filler are an option as well as Ian who attends expos regularly.<br>Lastly, a Janice who lacks the skill may take it to attend expeditions for her personal Glory objective.</cite>Personal glory objective shouldn't be a reason to give someone a mage book.

Raluca/Hua (Technician)<br>Due to the high AP demand associated with Comms manager IT Expert can supplement Paola instead of rations.<br>Alternatively, Finola or Kuan Ti could take it to get even better at Research and NERON Projects respectively.<br>Freida could always use more AP for scanning planets, so she is a decent candidate as well.<br>Chun and Ian can both contribute to research with this skill, Ian will be able to relay even if he spent all his AP maintaining his 8 Banana plants and Chun can provide relays beyond what she usually can.<br>Finally, Raluca or Hua with Technician could take this skill to further their ability to assist with NERON projects, as Hua is strapped for AP to begin with as a pilot, this allows her to make the most of her skillset, and Raluca with Physicist and Tech becomes even more potent.</cite>Add Gioele, if he has the Astro skill and I'm more or less pleased with it. However, Technician as a skill, that makes you dirty seems a horrible fit for a skill that requires you to be clean to be used. Also no NERON projects will stop completely at some point, which makes Tech/IT a horrible combo.</p><p><cite><strong>Logistics Expert</strong><br>1. Paola<em>1</em><br>2. Freida<br>3. Chun<br>4. Andie/Finola<br>5. Ian<br>6. Anyone<br>The best option for Logistics Expert is to power up Paola by giving it to Freida, but should Paola lack it to begin with, she should get it so that Freida doesn't run low on AP for planet scanning.<br>Otherwise, Chun is a good option assuming there isn't a medic book, as she can take the skill then sleep in Medlab with Ian or Finola/Andie idling there gaining AP from it.<br>For similar reasons, Finola/Andie or Ian can take the skill then give the benefit of it to a Chun who is standing in Medlab.<br>With all other characters, randomness is a bit to heavily involved, but it is still better used than not.</cite>Agree here as well. However, Raluca is a truly bad choice... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>

Chun<br>2. Ian<br>3. Finola<em>1</em>/Andie<br>4. Paola<em>4</em><br>5. Janice<br>Medic is one of the more powerful abilities bestowed by Mage Books, Chun's reason for wanting it are three-fold, excellent sync with the Nurse skill, the fact that she is guaranteed to be Human, therein, you would not be “wasting” the book on a Mush and lastly that she is a researcher without Biologist or Medic to begin with. Ian is the second best option with the ability syncing well with his Biologist or Mycologist skills. A Finola lacking Medic or Andie can take this one for a buff to their research power. Paola with her jobs complete is another option with the powerful Medic/Biologist sync. Finally, Janice who has taken IT Expert/Diplomat is another option, as IT Experts free abilities apply to researching as well and Diplomats attend most Expeditions, and could be helpful healing the team upon return.</cite><p>Best combo with <em>Nurse</em>(Chun, Finola). Otherwise mentioned Gioele and Ian with their AP boosting skills are great choices or <em>IT Experts</em> if it's solely for research. Should go to one of the most active crew members.<br><cite><strong>Pilot</strong><br>1. Stephen<br>2. Derek<em>3</em><br>3. Roland<em>1</em><br>4. Hua<em>1</em><br>5. Jin Su<em>1</em><br>6. Chao<em>3</em>/Paola<em>4</em><br>Pilot, the one skill that stops the ship exploding by prevention rather than repair. There are a three people per ship who don't receive this skill but are given the Shooter skill in it's place, Stephen everyone's favourite stowaway chef is a prime example of this, and if he doesn't have access to Apprentice, he should be high in the running to take the book.<br>Derek is another potential Generalist with Shooter who could “graduate” into pilothood, he is tiered lower than Stephen due to him being a prime transfer target already, but should the Mush have been dealt with, he can become a fantastic Pilot.<br>Roland, Hua and Jin Su are all people who naturally have Pilot, but may not take it due to level restrictions or need of other roles, should they not have it, consider giving it to them.<br>Chao is an option, but not the best; as Hyperactive prevents him from regenerating AP properly, should you be out of options, consider him before Janice or Kuan Ti simply because he get's free shooter points.</cite>Anyone with <em>Shooter</em> is great for this book. Also <em>Caffeine Junkie</em> and <em>Frugivore</em>. Try to avoid Pilot/Astro or Pilot/research combos if possible(AP-intensive and in 2 different areas of the ship).</p><p><cite><strong>Radio Expert</strong><br>1. Paola<em>1</em><br>2. Freida<em>1</em>/Eleesha<em>2</em> <br>3. Gioele (With Astrophysicist)<br>4. Jin Su<br>5. Janice/Finola/Andie<em>3</em> (With Diplomat or Polyvalent)<br>6. Any Generalist<br>This ability is most useful in the hands of people who frequent the bridge, as Paola and Freida live there, Eleesha is a viable option because of her place in the Comms Manager hierarchy, Jin Su and Gioele (with Astrophysicist) are also there frequently, The Diplomats are viable because of their usefulness in making trades with aliens. Lastly, Generalists are always an option for “Junk books.”<br>A Paola who has finished her main objective is usually looking for a new job, Pilot is an option if she isn't Gunner.</cite>In my opinion you don't even need a priority here... just let anyone, who feels like reading it read it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><cite><strong>Robotics Expert</strong><br>1. Generalists<br>2. Terrence<em>1</em><br>3. Eleesha<em>4</em><br>Robotics Expert is helpful in that it gives a free drone blueprint upon being read, as such, it should be read early on. Stephen, Gioele or Derek make excellent candidates for it as they lack set jobs and building those pesky drones can be quite AP intensive.<br>Returning the ability to perform upgrades to Terrence is an obvious choice.<br>You could also give it to an Eleesha who has finished the Mush Hunt.</cite>The recipient should be somewhat active and maybe around the dorms(proximity to AB2) to upgrade drones. Also <em>Technician</em> may be considerable as dismantling objects and building drones can be done in one swoop. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><cite><strong>Shooter</strong><br>1. Hua<br>2. Andie<em>3</em>/Freida<br>3. Roland<em>1</em><br>4. Terrence<em>1</em><br>5. Paola<em>1</em> (Gunner)<br>6. Jin Su<em>1</em><br>This is an easy one, Shooter is really only useful to Pilots, and 50% of Pilots get the skill naturally, this book will almost always go to Hua assuming she is a functioning Human, if she isn't however, it could be used to turn Andie or Freida into a decent dogfighter. Occasionally a Pilot may not be able to take Shooter, eg; Bronze Roland, so the book can also supplement them. Paola with Gunner can make good use of the skill as well.</cite>There's not really a priority on which Pilot should take it...</p><p><cite><strong>Shrink</strong><br>1. Chao<em>3</em><br>2. Stephen<br>3. Gioele<br>4. Eleesha<em>4</em><br>5. Derek<em>3</em><br>Shrink is a bit of a curve-ball skill, whilst incredibly helpful, it can also be a bit of a resource drain on anyone with an existing job, hence why Generalists make up the entirety of this list.<br>Chao sits at the number one spot due to the nature of his Hyperactivity trait, being unable to lie down, but still wanting the protection of the camera means he will more often than not be in the Dorms anyway, and able to give the passive Shrink bonus to more people than any other character could.<br>Stephen is above Gioele because Gio is better for more AP intensive tasks because of his Caffeine addict ability.<br>Eleesha is usually in need of a new job after finishing off the Mush, so barring her having Technician, Shrink is a good option.<br>Derek sits low here because he is already a major transfer target, adding the ability to take out a Shrink with their rampage may just cause the Mushrooms to act, but if they are dealt with already; it's an acceptable option.</cite>Shrink is a dorm skill and usually goes to someone, who's abled to stand there all the time. Now it depends on whether there are other Shrinks or not: If not you want to give it to someone without a specific task, but if there are other Shrinks you can give it to anyone in the dorms. Personally I find Caffeine Junkie a bad match for Shrink as one works the best when staying in dorms while the other suggests you to stay in the Refectory.</p><p><cite><strong>Sprinter</strong><br>1. Derek<em>3</em>/Ian<br>2. Terrence<br>3. Eleesha/any Technician<br>4. Anyone<br>Sprinter isn't the most useful of books, in-fact, it is probably the most useless of all of them, but Firefighters Derek and Ian can get some use out of it, and an Eleesha could drop the Scooter in a dorm for communal use if she took this skill any Technician could use this skill whilst hunting down breakages aboard the Daedalus also. Terrence could take it to completely counter the AP/MP conversion issues that arise with his handicapped trait.<br>Anyone who regularly attends expeditions could take it to help on them too.</cite>Completely agree here. Though if the ship got Fire Detector, Firefighters usually drop in priority.</p><p><cite><strong>Technician</strong><br>1. Generalists<br>2. Anyone<em>4</em><br>3. Kuan Ti<em>1</em><br>4. Raluca<em>1</em><br>5. Eleesha<em>1</em><br>Technician is a powerful skill and Generalists like Gioele and Stephen can do a lot with it, but really, anyone who has finished there job can make use of it. It could also be used to give the skill to a character who usually has it but neglected or was unable to take it, Kuan Ti and Raluca being common examples of this.<br>Eleesha can make a decent Technician once the Mush Hunt is concluded, but as she is usually not a level 5, she doesn't typically have access to it naturally.</cite>Basically similar to Firefighter: Increased movement is very valuable here. Try to not combine it with AP-intensive skills(Astro) or skills that require you to be clean.</p>

I often play Eleesha, with Tech and IT Expert, and I usually say that I will help with scanning when research, projects and Pilgred are done. But being a Tech means that I also get dirty a lot, which is not really compatible with astro. It's better with a magebook, though. But again, it depends on the skills and on the crew.

Since Chao has Shooter, he can be a good pilot (but of course it depends on Logistics).</p>
