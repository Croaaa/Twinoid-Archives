                <p>Alright. I'll list the things I've found out, and the things I'm guessing about. Things that have happened through play: <br> <br>Don't hesitate. If you think you have the mush, kill him as soon as possible. Occasionally you'll be wrong, but if you think you know who it is kill it. They will not refrain from rampaging if they think you know them. Once, a great ship figured out both mush. They wanted to cure one, but Raluca didn't have genius. They were about to kill them when they rampaged with a transfer to inactive Derek, killing all the techs(there were 4 to 5). Another ship we lost our only diplomat when we had all but figured out the mush(through cross-referencing potential jelly suspects and the only other person had no real mushy actions).<br> <br>Green Jelly: If a camera breaks early, I'd almost guarantee jelly. See who could have done it, by checking who was standing in the room for the 4 cycles before it broke. Then, check who was standing up after it broke. If you repair it quickly, there may be no mush in category two, but it will give potential suspects. If cameras break twice, compare who was in both rooms in the time before it broke. This will rarely make a lot of suspects, so you can generally get a pretty good idea for at least one of the mush.<br>Stuff I assume from being mush: <br> <br> Look for people that get dirty around once per day. A mush will usually only want to be dirty this often to extract spores, as usually it's all done in one go. People in Bravo Dorm(or Alpha if the shower's there) will be the bane of your existence. They can report being dirty rarely and stealth shower to cover it. Watch these people, as you can't get them from being dirty.<br> <br> AP counting: This can work, but if you make a mistake it can completely screw over your team. I actually allowed a mush Eden to happen because I miscounted a potential mush's AP and said she wouldn't have the AP to triple spore the ration and we had mycoscan, so if she did less she'd be caught. Figure out how much AP they seemed to have used and how much they should have used. There can be some left in the tank from not being active for a few cycles, so this will be a tedious process if you don't ask them to report it themselves.</p><p>That's a couple things I've figured. Here's it shortened:<br>Don't hesitate to kill suspicious subjects unless they're super helpful and could be cured.<br>If a camera breaks, it's probably green jelly.<br>Getting dirty around once a day. This is really the only times mush want to be dirty, as they only need to take spores once.<br>AP counting can work, but is tedious and a mistake could completely ruin you.<br>Verifying humans without food tests mostly involves people that get sick from expos or random events(vomiting/when you heal them there's a message). That can get you a few people, but they can still be converted, and they'll relay all your circle of trust information to their mush allies if they are.<br>Urgh, I can't indent, so I put breaks in between stuff.</p>

He and Raluca were the only ones who had been in there in the time frame for green jelly and he fit the profile for a mush. He was human. Raluca: also human, thankfully we assumed natural break at that point because she was smart and it wouldn't make any sense at all for her to green jelly her camera and stand there, given she had never been to the shower dorm. <br>On the ship I just finished, I believe we had 5 mush when our bravo dorm camera broke on Day 6 I think it was. None of us had green jellied it. The very next cycle, alpha dorm camera broke. Also no green jelly. o.O</p><p>Not to say the point is invalid, just.... be careful.</p><br><p>There are two things I often do when mush hunting. <br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Copy all logs to a spreadsheet. <br>You don't have to be Eleesha to do this or make sense of it, just makes it easier. I do it whenever I am playing someone who is not confined to one area... and even then sometimes, especially with places like bravo dorm if I have access, and refectory. It takes some practice to make sense of raw logs, but it does give you a nice big picture of what people are doing. If you are suspicious about a certain person, you can reference it and get a general idea of what they've been doing.</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Make a list with every non-chun person on it. Note the things they do that look mushy, the things that make them look non-mush, and general feelings you get about that person.<br> Any other information you think is relevant and can track is a bonus. This will help with the tendency to not notice the quiet ones so much, and again, give you an overall picture of each person aboard the ship. I don't do this so often these days because to be honest, I've gotten comfortable enough with the logs that I often don't really feel I need to.... but it does help, especially if you can't collect many logs.</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Talk with people.<br>This one may not help you so much Streaky, given how taciturn you seemed to be shipside, but... I like to talk with people one on one to gauge them. Can just start with something like asking if they are experienced with their role and if they have any questions.... or if they have any thoughts on who the mush might be. Or heck, just to chat. Maybe they saw something you didn't. Or maybe they will look dodgy. Any which way, gives you a better idea of who and how that person is, and this is information you can use. And yes, that will give certain people a chance to manipulate you but... that's part of the fun of it, eh? ^^</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico"> Keep track of who your newbies are. <br>Yes, keep in mind that they could be pretending to be newbie to hide suspicious activity. Although this is a deplorable practice, some people <strong>do</strong> do it. But in general, think about the things they are doing and think 'could I see a newbie reasonably making this mistake?' I often ask in gen who our newer players are and start a pm with any who respond right off the bat. This isn't really related to mush hunting so much as mentoring new players, but an awareness of newbies will help avoid innocent deaths.</p>

                <p>I like those tips! Although given my apparant <strong>TACITURN</strong> nature, a problem is that sometimes i feel like things get a little too complex for me to easily wrap my head around, so usually if someone's making really in-depth, complex plans or investigations, I just tend to nod my head unless I have some glaring questions.</p><p>Also in regards to the spreadsheets, do you format them at all or is it literally just copy, paste, dump?</p>

Yep, me and those two.</p><p>Keep in mind though, a truly fantastic Mush can and will avoid all these common missteps, so think outside the box, bait them, idle in a corridor and so who passes by. (Don't do this without a Mycologist on board though, to risky.) Lure the Mush out, and don't forget: All humans make mistakes, and Mush do too.</p><p>I'm not very helpful, but I tried.</p><p>-Level 14 Mush, Darksteel.</p>

                <p>Edward, one way that should make survival likely if you get dirty before mush selection, and have to or choose to stay dirty (maybe you spent all your AP and got dirty on that last AP or something); go to a dorm with a shower and a camera, and tell the ship you're there and intend to wash before you leave the room. Creating a spore in a camera room, or a room with other players in it creates a roomlog. If you are clean before you leave that room and stay clean afterwards; you could not have spored (assuming the roomlog is free of your sporing.... and not messed with by defacer). Doesn't mean you're human, but it does mean you didn't make spores.</p><p>Or you could be sure to wash before mush selection.</p>

                <p>My favorite mush hunting strategies are rather off the cuff.</p><p>It seems to me that a lot of players play with pretty high paranoia and I think that really weakens the human team; of the 15 possible mush at game start, 13 are human for sure. If you're human, you have 13 other allies, you just don't know exactly which 13 save for Chun, and Chun just knows that 13 others are allies at the start.</p><p>I use that, and use it extensively in my mush hunting. Any of us could be weaker players, any of us could be mush. But I gather typically 5-6 players into a PM, myself and Chun (unless Chun was griefer) and then a handful of the others, who seem to be stronger players, active, concerned, involved.</p><p>It's an anything chat, we deal with possible griefers and I at least discuss evidence in it about possible mush; I encourage everyone to discuss what they see, and remind that we're not confirmed human here; if any group member has a concern about any other group member, I encourage them to make another PM with everyone but the worrisome player and lets discuss that.</p><p>For me that seems to work really well. The team tends to be smarter and more observant than any one player; that 5-6 member group selected mostly from interested, active, involved players tends to contain a number of better players (some better players don't choose to show themselves that way, that's fine, but many of your better players can be identified by those traits; and the ones with those traits who are new are going to be better players after they play a few games).</p><p>Sometimes that group contains a mush! And that's actually fine. Sure, Mr Mush knows what we're initially looking at and who the leaders are, but there's 4-5 leaders besides himself. We tend to be scattered all over the ship, a rampage to kill us all won't be easy, and now Mr Mush's thoughts, not just his actions are exposed. He has to talk about what he sees and doesn't see, what he thinks is mushy or not about what others (and possibly his partner) do, and he has to seem to have human priorities while he does so, with multiple smart minds able to read his words and see his actions, and judge if he's really 'one of us' or not.</p><p>For me that seems a great tool to catch mush, no matter if the mush has been brought into the group or not. And such groups tend to help limit the number of miskills the ship does, because many sets of eyes are gathering and discussing evidence, so more ideas about that behavior and more evidence in total is usually being considered.</p><p>So the attitude of 'can't trust anyone, so don't talk to the others', resisting others, just treating everyone on the ship like they are probably (instead of possibly) mush.... for me that seems like such a waste of a team that can be built, most of the players in it forming the core that will work together and lead the ship to the end of its play. Start early, not late, and if one of the leader-types on your ship is mush, spotlight them and see what they do, that's my favorite strategy, at least.</p>

                <p>Sometimes there's nothing to look for.</p><p>Maybe you're playing Paola, and only see a few different roomlogs during the mush-hunt part of the game, or you're Raluca and also blind to most of the ship. Oh well. You don't have to see it yourself if there's a team of people looking and talking about what they see, that's almost as good as seeing evidence yourself, because 5-6 people is usually enough to keep a mush you may have from lying about evidence (odds are high a lie would be noticed).</p><p>If you're not sure what to talk about seeing.... talk about what you see. One of my early ships someone included me in a small group of active players' PM; I was a researcher sleeping in medlab and regularly went to the lab for research. The cat was in the lab, and I mentioned what I saw; that a specific player had come and cuddled the cat.</p><p>That allowed the group, who had people in the dorms, to catch a mush; because though I had no idea about the rest of that player's activities were, the group as a whole included people in both dorms. And that cuddler had spent several cycles by the shrink, then gone to hug the cat.... that helped identify mush, not human behavior and priorities, and resulted in a dead mush.</p><p>But I didn't know that cuddle was suspicious; I was a pretty new player then and didn't even understand much of the mush hunt. I didn't report the cuddle as suspicious; I just reported it as meaningful. It was a significant something that happened; it was useful for potentially helping track morale and AP usage.</p><p>The group has the power to put this information together, and everything we learn makes us a stronger and better member of the group.</p><p>So build those groups if you choose; and participate in them whenever you can; just talk about what you notice, and trust that you'll keep learning and all will be well across most of your games.</p>

(For the record, I myself wasn't in the group. It was a partner that copy and pasted the PM stuff in the Mush channel.) The first case, the humans would have possibly focused on killing Ian first, and then killing the rest of the Mush. Having the PM there so Ian could try to convince the other humans that he was human bought us time. The second case, I'm not sure. The humans thought there were only two Mush: Roland, the one remaining Alpha Mush, and Raluca that got converted by Roland. No one ever suspected that I had secretly converted Stephen as well. Stephen was updating us about what the humans thought and planned. As long as no one suspected Stephen, the infiltration of Sol was a-go. It certainly was helpful to have a Mush in the Mush hunting chat in case Raluca and I needed to react quickly to something.</p>

                <p>Interesting. Well, it's certainly not a perfect strategy, and by no means is <em>every</em> mush taken into a mush hunt group going to be caught, because of that group or for any other reason.</p><p>And the exact personalities and experience levels in play are really going to matter too. Some groups of humans are going to catch on quick, and some slow. Some mush are way better at appearing human than others and calmly discussing mush hunting in a believable fashion.</p><p>When we've found that there seems to be a mush in the mushhunt group, the answer so far as been to create a second PM with all members but the mushy one, to use both threads and control information flow in the mushed one, and make the plans that matter in the unmushed one. For that reason, I've played with the faith that it doesn't matter if there's a mush in the mushhunt group or not, that's potentially even another way to catch them.</p><p>On a very recent ship, the humans of a mushhunt group that had a mush in it even appeared to utterly believe a mush ploy that a dead human (followed by a mush going anon, and the mush in the hunt PM pointing out that a mush was dead) was actually a dead mush. And we delayed rushing the new research long enough (since.... no dead mush means research doesn't actually unlock) for the mush team to apparently decide they'd better give us a dead mush so we would continue to fall for this ploy and not notice something was wrong; and the mush we hadn't caught yet actually rampaged and exposed themself.</p><p>Now, if the mush is running the mush hunt thread in truth, that's going to be a problem for the humans, but if the 5-6 most active, involved, and communicative players on the ship together are not very strong players, then that ship's probably going down if its mush are any good, no matter if the mush hunt has a mush in it or not.</p>

                <p>Mush can be divided into Newbie and Experienced.<br>Newbies make an excuse of being dirty by eating or cooking. If he's not pilot, I see no reason to eat anything. 99% proof you may get when somebody gets dirty by eating and no AP to wash himself, unless he's a pilot and used them to shoot some hunters. They often get dirty in first day and use soap to wash himself. They act to be shy and quiet. Sometimes they go rampage at start.<br>Experienced Mush isn't afraid to communicate. He plays calm, talk what crew wants to hear (being resistant to newbie human) and make an excuse of getting dirty by listening orders. They don't go through Medlab or Rear Turret without good reason. If they want to get dirty and don't have a good excuse, in order to extracting some spores, they go showering without soap. They're also a bit helpful in doing their work.

                <p>Patryk missed a common one:</p><p>Blame shifter.<br>Common enough, will try and focus the attention of Mushism away from themselves. Using moves like Slimetrap and the like. Watch out for these, if a name keeps cropping up in a chat, or main post "tattling" on others, they could be mush... keep in mind, there is an advanced variety of these too. They get someone else to tattle for them... The premise remains the same.</p><p>It'd be interesting to have all the common Mush plays laid out, as there are more, like "Long Haul" and Sol Rushers.</p>

                <p>The danger is "inactive" mush (who are only a day or so away from starving checks) suddenly waking up and rampaging. And whenever my ship tries to prevent that by killing super inactives, of course they all turn out to be human. I'm starting to get a little better at telling the difference based on pre-selection activity, but even that isn't a perfect method. I tend to be too cautious and ultimately give them time to make their move. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Most people here are using word "hunt" here to describe "how we wait for mush mistakes" at best. In worst - "let's wait until Eleesha finds something for us". Boring.</p><p>Special advices for everyone, even new players who know nothing about hunting:<br>1) If you are human tell your team about your every action. Post all planets you found, even if you deleted them, tell when and how many hunters you killed, tell in general about every reset. Peole can see your work (will help you not to be killed by mistake and make them much more certain about you), also will be easier to see situation on the ship and teach you if you do wrong.<br>2) If you are human don't make yourself a suspect. Don't need to pass shower dorm - don't. Going to eat from bridge - spend 2mp to take apron. Don't pass med or Raluca room. Don't make others to waste energy to suspect you.</p><p>Now advices for hunters:<br>1) Be active in right times<br>- Be active during day change and you will easily kill mush(es) if they want to use double-spore trick on day change.<br>- If you noticed a player leaving shower dorm - update your game and see where he is going. If you see he went to do some work, for example in nexus, update in real time and catch the moment he ruturns. You can detect being dirty like that. Example of game won like that: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5443" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5443</a><br>2) Make traps for mushes yourself<br>Some examples include:<br>- Idling in corridor/bay with alarm ready<br>- Idling in corridor/bay, heal with mycologist 2 times, let few people pass you, then rush scanner and check if you were spored<br>- Forget hacker's kit or commander (commander without ap) in dorm and launch expo. Leave Chun with armor on guard of FC without telling anything about it.<br>- While playing important character like Janny cry about your low hp/morale when you have full to make mushes attacking you. Dangerous for you, yes, but really mush can kill at least one human if they want anytime.<br>3) Just warnings for actions like passing med is best way to let mushes to do what they want and then say "oh, forgot". Get natami and do 2 shoots at each suspect. If they die from headshot - it's their fate, but more likely you get a confirmed human or mush body.</p>

                <p>Some of these tips I used as Mush. I didn't get dirty and even didn't visit Bravo Dorm. I convinced Chun to treat me as anti-Mush hunter and... as my role was on the Bridge, I checked front turret, extracted a spore, returned to Bridge, ate a ration and said "got dirty because of eating, going to shower when recover some MP". I knew they wouldn't kill me because of no proof (just suspectting doesn't kill me), and 3 cycles later doing rampage using transferring. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>If you are going to make rampage, then humans really can do nothing to stop you. You can make one showering even with weak reason and it's very unlikely you will be killed just for that. Still if humans secured weapons, don't keep idles with full ap alive, rampage to kill 1-3 humans can be not enough to finish the ship. We survived once after losing 8 crew members with no pilots and no teches to rampage of both mushes.</p>

                <p>There's no one "right" strategy, but anyone who has ever been on the same ship as me knows my favourite strategies: <em>information control</em>, <em>social engineering</em> and <em>mind games</em>.</p><br><p><strong>INFORMATION CONTROL</strong></p><p>Maybe I'm a control freak or something, but I like being in control of who has what information and when they have them. I like to be the person who knows everything. So, I gain the trust of my crew when I need to know something from them, and I conveniently only share the absolute minimum information with them, enough to protect them from the mushies but not enough for them to really harm my mush hunt if they turn out to be alpha or beta mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Incidentally, this also really helps me if someone ever turns me into a beta mush. Being in control of so much information while being mush is really fun.</p><br><p><strong>SOCIAL ENGINEERING</strong> &amp; <strong>MIND GAMES</strong></p><p>Being the person in charge of information flow has benefits here: I'm usually able to create circumstances that allow me to either trap the mushies in a lie, or to expose humans to my spore traps, usually in some complex scheme. And I do so with glee. It is really, really fun, and it's hands down the most fun thing about this game! I highly recommend as many people try this sort of strategy out as possible. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This strategy works for both mush hunters and for mushies.</p><br><p><strong>LOGS TRACING</strong></p><p>Saving room logs is a lot of work, I don't actually do it that often anymore unless I'm playing the mush hunter. But, it really helps with the mush hunt...like, a lot! A lot of times we can't remember very specific yet very crucial details of events a long time ago, like whether or not someone ate in D2. If you saved the logs, then you'll always be able to recall these information/evidences any time you need them.</p><p>Not only that, sometimes you get the opportunity to catch someone in a lie when they say things like "oh, I ran out of APs". With the logs, you can check if they actually did anything to drain their APs without going anywhere. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So, yeah, don't underestimate the power of saving room logs!</p>

                <p>My thoughts on information control.</p><p>When I'm a mush, I don't need much information to win, and the info I do need is almost impossible to keep from me (how the game overall is going, what the ship's approximate weaknesses are). Hiding information like detailed roomlogs and clues as to who is maybe mushy; keeping that from everyone mostly serves to weaken the human team. And, worst of all, keeping it from me doesn't weaken me significantly. I can get the info I need to decide on a plan and to make it work just by my normal play; I don't need the type of information the human team could be collecting.</p><p>You often need detailed roomlogs and understanding of each player's actions, when human, to catch mush and identify mush from just mushy. The mush need that only to fine-tune their ability to specifically time converting one person over another; and that's only going to work well if that person is sloppy anyway; in which case the mush don't need to be told that the person's vunerable. If I intend to convert you, I will find a way or fail to find a way without your fancy roomlog collection.</p><p>As a human, I hate seeing humans killed unless they're griefer-level of bad. It's deeply important to me, usually, to spare the humans and kill the actual mush. We need those humans if they're active and communicating even a little; they're going to be part of the win later. I don't want humans killed for weaker play or weird choices, and I get really mad on my ships when people 'mark mush' and start killing without adequate evidence.</p><p>There's times when the mush (or griefers) give you no time, when you kill them or they do terrible damage, and they generally reveal themselves by starting to do terrible damage. That's different, way different. Those players are not the sort I'm talking about, there's a huge difference between the play of someone trying to take out the ship and the 'minor weirdness' of a player who doesn't really understand stuff and who is figuring out how to play and doing weird stuff. Kill the killers; identify the harmless weird and watch them and talk to them; sometimes those harmless weird are mush trying to hide. But many of them are not! So correct, rather than kill, is my preference, all the while watching them and everyone else.</p><p>What am I going to do with lots of information as a mush? Twist it so that humans are killed for being mushy? Maybe. That's about the only use I can think of. I don't need that information to win. But as a human? I need that information, and the main way I'll be using it is to identify who isn't mush, who is playing weird versus playing harmful. Not so easy to do that backwards, when I am mush. So don't keep information from me, when I'm human. You're only hurting yourself, really.</p><p>And when I'm mush? Keep all the information you want to yourself. You're only helping me.</p>

I need that information, and the main way I'll be using it is to identify who isn't mush, who is playing weird versus playing harmful. Not so easy to do that backwards, when I am mush.

I wasn't even trying to get anyone killed...just distract them a bit from the actual mushies while we prep for our grand plans.

The best way to prevent rampages is to limit their options, keep an extinguisher or / BP safe, hide the grenade, and have derek keep low AP while holding a ration. I actually just stopped a dangerous D2 rampage my current game by picking derek (they still tried to rampage though) - because human's can get AP by food / pills / being trusted by the captain he doesn't need to sit on a full AP bar. Also in your game it looks like the human's still went to sol despite your rampage. <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5349" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5349</a></p>
