Preferably for bronze mode.</p><p>I'm looking at the skills and i think technician seems easy enough but i'd still like some advice or if i should pick another primary character.</p><br><br><p>Also i don't plan on going to Gold Mode, i don't have the cash to do that so any advice that tells me to spend any cash would be useless.</p>

                <p>Hi there. There's a lot of general gameplay advice available here: <a href="/tid/forum#!view/112222|thread/33990294?p=1" target="_self">Tutorials and helpful links</a> a list of links about all sorts of different things.</p><p>The part of that which is specific for Terrence only talks about drones.</p><p>Terrence has two unique traits different from other characters; he is handicapped and has unique rules for movement, and his first skill (Once you have leveled, you pick 1 from among your unlocked skills, and may select a different one if you choose), robotics expert, is unique to him unless a skillbook with the skill appears on the ship (small chance of that).</p><p>As to how to play, I recommend that you consider yourself a generalist, and expect to do everything that needs doing at the time. Generalist characters can be a lot of fun, because they do all sorts of things; whereas specialists tend to do only one or two things that they are better at. Ships need both generalists and specialists to function well.</p><p>To find out what your ship needs done each time you log in, talk to them. Post a message saying you are around, you have X AP, what can you do to help? Then refresh the page in a few minutes, hopefully someone sees and answers you shortly. With more experience you can read the ship's messages and judge pretty well what needs doing. Should no one answer you quickly, in general, if something is on fire, get an extinguisher and put it out; the current project could use a reset, and the lab research being worked on could use a reset. Your ship will always need you.</p><p>Specifics about drones; work with your pilots and ship to find out when there is enough scrap to improve drones or build any new ones you have a blueprint for; it takes a lot of scrap and other things need scrap too. Most people agree that 'turbo' is the best first drone improvement. 'Firefighter' is super useful, it prevents fires from breaking drones (they are hard to fix, and only fires break them), and allows the drone to try and extinguish any fires it encounters.</p><p>'Pilot' is a very questionable upgrade. In order for it to help your ship, your ship needs to complete the project 'magnetic net'; which is not always possible to do. Not every ship with Magnetic Net can benefit from pilot drones - every piloting drone is not available to repair or fight fires; but for a ship that needs pilot drones and has the Net, that upgrade can be a lifesaver.</p><p>'Pathfinder' is a comparatively useless improvement, it seems to be bugged at the current time, and instead of making drones head straight to where they are needed instead of wander aimlessly, seems to make them wander determinedly between just a few rooms (meaning they don't eventually find whatever has been broken and fix it). Generally this upgrade is considered a waste of the metal to do it.</p><br><p>As to your unique movement mechanics; you're in a wheelchair. If you leave a room with a living person in it, they will 'push you' out of the room, costing you no movement points. This is unique to you; everyone else must spend 1 movement point to move between rooms at all times; you have potentially unlimited movement. If you do not have any movement points but need one, one of your AP becomes 1 movement point. For everyone else, if they don't have movement points but need one, one of their AP becomes 3 movement points. There are things that affect this, helpfully like carrying the scooter (makes you like the other characters while charges remain, makes other characters get 5 movement for 1 AP), harmfully like a broken gravity simulator (increases the cost to turn AP into moves - you can't pay the higher cost, so if you have no moves.... you cannot move while grav sim is broken).</p>

                <p>Thank you for the replies but i probably won't be a robotics expert it seems to be a bit to complicated and considering i'm a bronze. Limited. There's also the issue with needing scrap but mostly i like repairing or helping build things rather than actually build things. Again thanks for the answer. I've already looked at the mushpedia and guides and i'm noticed more guide on the Robotics.</p>
