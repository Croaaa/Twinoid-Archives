                <p>Hello. I'm a totally new player, and I want to start playing this game because it seems very fun. However I tried playing it once before and I just had no idea what to do, and ended up not playing after a while. So I would need a nice person to tell me pretty much everything about the game (because far as I know this one doesn't have the nice little checkbox list that D2N does, thank god for that one). And by everything I mean pretty much: What's the goal? What's the basic actions you do every day (like exploring in die2nite) and stuff like that.</p>

                <p>There's a lovely <a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a> that will answer a lot of your questions. Basic goals are simple: if you're a human, you want to kill all the Mush and survive to get to Sol or Eden. If you're a mush, you want to screw things up so the humans can't do that, or manage to hide along to Sol or Eden.</p><p>There's also an in-progress page <a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Job_overview">here</a> that gives you the basics on the types of jobs on the ship and who should be doing them. Should you have more specific questions, ask your crew/mush partner or look at the Questions and Answers thread. Welcome to the game, and have fun! c:</p>

                <p>After you read enough to feel a bit more comfortable, I urge you to just join a ship and talk.</p><p>Say that you're new, say that you want help, and then check in, ideally as often as you can.</p><p>The game has 3 hour cycles; so you get more points to spend and more random events can happen every cycle change, but other players may be active and answer you at any point. So talk, and then check back in. Refresh the page to see answers, and if people are active and talking to you then, ask your questions and respond and carry out your conversation rapidly in real time; if most of your talkative ship is active when you cannot be around the conversation will still happen, just more slowly. Just don't give up, keep checking back.</p><p>There are a very large number of players who truly enjoy interacting with others, to meet ship goals and to help players learn the game better (not just newbies, lots of us love sharing whatever tricks we have learned with everyone, I learn new stuff almost every ship still)</p><p>So there is a small chance (so much is up to chance here!) that you'll end up on a ship without any experienced players who like to talk and help.... such ships are doomed to an early death and you won't be on it long. So try again with the next ship. Soon you will be having a great time, and part of a functional team of players who really need your help to save the ship (or destroy it) and will help you learn immediately useful and needed lessons about how to play.</p>

                <p>To add to what's already been said here, there's nothing quite like firsthand experience. Sure, you can read the wiki, watch gameplay videos, and browse the forum...and that will only scratch the surface of the complexities of the game. Some of them are related to game mechanics, while many others are related to social dynamics: Is it possible a Mush sabotaged that now-smoking item, or was it just random chance that it broke at the cycle change? What are the chances that player got dirty while conducting repairs? Is it possible that they're Mush and they're lying? Did that researcher <em>really</em> forget to use the Apron, or are they just using it as an excuse to cover their sporing?</p><p>Paranoia fuels the Mush hunts in this game, and mistakes will inevitably be made. Sometimes, you just have to trust your instincts, and hope the others will see the evidence you present as reason enough to kill someone. With enough firsthand experience, you can go from spotting the "easy" lies (e.g. "I got dirty while firing from a turret" ) to getting a feel for when someone is showering a little <em>too</em> often...or not often enough.</p><p>One bit of advice I always try to give new players: The popup hints (e.g. "You're hungry, so go eat something" ) can actually get you killed, so ask your crew before you do what you're told by the popups. I have a theory that they're intentionally designed to get newbies to communicate. Why? Because if they don't communicate, they get killed. If they do things that make them look like potential Mush, they get killed. If they randomly go from room to room, clicking ALL the things...yep, they tend to get killed. Doing all of the above can easily lead to sanctions, if one is reported.</p><p>Which leads into the second bit of advice I always try to give to new players: Communicate, communicate, COMMUNICATE! Reporting in with the things you accomplish every day proves two things to your crew. First, that you're active, and that the things you are doing can help the ship. This takes suspicion off of you, and they're far less likely to kill you if they know that you're active, and have a good idea of how your AP is being spent. Results speak louder than words. Second, it makes things easier to coordinate your efforts, be it for research, projects, killing hunters, and so on. If you can be relied upon, you're less likely to be considered expendable. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>My third bit of advice: Ask lots of questions. LOTS of them! Even if you might think of it as being annoying, do it anyway. It's better for other players to clearly see that you're new, rather than for them to assume you already know what you're doing. Many experienced players enjoy answering questions for the newbies, even if we often end up repeating ourselves time and time again. You never know when that new player is going to perform above and beyond the call of duty, and be instrumental in getting your ship to Eden. This is also one of those games that stresses "what you <em>don't</em> know <strong>will</strong> kill you", so the better equipped the newbies are to survive, the better the ship's chances of survival. Consequently, the more you communicate, the more likely you are to have a successful voyage.</p>
