                <p>First, allow me to point out that, compared to a fairly good percentage of the people on this forum posting guides, my experience is practically negligible. I haven't had glorious ships lasting to day 10+, I haven't always been active on my ships, and I've only been human for half of my ships. Actually, that last point is one I'm fairly happy with. So far, in my currently six ships, I've been Mush 50% of the time... Game's telling me something, but that's off course.</p><p>When it comes to the Art of the Patsy (Or, the Art of Turning Everybody Against Some Poor Innocent Soul who Happens to be in the Wrong Place at the Wrong Time), I've learned a few things. Of course, a lot of this will probably seem obvious, or even elementary to veteran players, but it wasn't so obvious to me at first. Becoming a master of the Art of the Patsy pretty much implies that, no matter who you are, you can always turn the ship against some innocent human and shrug it off when they find out he's not Mush. I'll go over a few basic tactics and then swap to tactics for more high leveled Mush, and tactics that require a bit more of wordplay.</p><p><strong>Hold on, guys, we should kill the inactives first before looking for the Mush amongst us</strong></p><p>Saying this in part of the guide kind of defeats the purpose, but it makes perfect sense. Inactives are a harm to human players. To Mush, they can be a huge benefit. While not specifically part of the Art of the Patsy, a favorite tactic of many is to spore an inactive to completion, take Anonymush, and then whistle a jolly good tune when they kill the inactive and find there's one less Mush to worry about. Even if you don't manage to infect an inactive totally, they'll still waste more AP than many would be comfortable with. AP that could be better used killing hunters, advancing tech, or pushing Neron projects. From a human perspective, it's AP well spent. From a Mush perspective, you just cost them the chance at killing at least two hunters.</p><p><strong>The Morale Trick</strong></p><p>I'm not sure how many people actually do this, but it's really important to keep track of. From the very start of your game, start tracking your morale. Bronze starts at 7, Gold starts at 8. Frankly, I don't care how you track it, it's just important that you do. You (are supposed to) lose one morale per day change, gain one morale from Janice, so on so forth. The important thing is that if anyone ever asks you, then you want to be able to accurately tell them what your morale should be. If you ever have to hesitate, guess what? They now know you're Mush. Mush are constantly at 16 morale points, and not knowing what morale you're supposed to be at can kill you instantly. A friend of mine demonstrated how effective morale counting is when she went back from day 1 and calculated exactly how much morale they should have, due to speeches, day changes, and stuff along those lines. Morale may not affect Mush, but it is <em>still</em> a killer.</p><p><strong>Oh my God he's in my body</strong></p><p>This is a tactic of mine that I haven't really gotten to test yet, but I'm fairly confident in its success. This is a tactic for <strong>Level six Mush</strong>, so, sadly, it won't be useful for anyone below that level. However, if you're level six... Well then. To explain it, I'm going to use three players. Players 'Jin Su', 'Chao', 'Ian', and 'Finola'. Player 'Jin Su' is Mush, and has the skill 'transfer', which allows him to transfer bodies with another human player. Player 'Jin Su' already has a small amount of suspicion on them. Ready? Tactic start.</p><p>First, Jin Su pretends he transfers bodies with Finola. (Note that these characters can change, it's just an example). Note that he doesn't <em>actually</em> transfer bodies. You know, he gets in the same room with them, and then starts spouting off that he's Finola in Jin Su's body. Props to you if you've observed 'Finola' from the beginning of the game and manage to mimic their writing style. Of course, the actual Finola will begin complaining. Whether the crew believes Finola or not doesn't matter. If they kill Finola first and find out she was human, big news, the tactic is a success. Now, how to get out of it? Obviously, they're thinking one of two things: You were Finola at first and transferred to Jin Su, or you never transferred in the first place. So they go up to kill you. Chao comes up into the room and begins to kill Jin Su. Extra props if there's a mycoalarm in the room. Jin Su then <strong>Spores</strong> and <strong>Transfers</strong> to Ian the inactive's body. Ian in Jin Su's body is killed, and you're in the body of an inactive. The trick here is to act inactive for a little bit. If there was a mycoalarm in the room, people will think Chao was turned into Mush and immediately took Anonymush, because of the BRIIIIIIIING sound. They'll then proceed to kill Chao. At that time, little sleeping Ian Mush can wake up.</p><p>This tactic works even if there is no inactive to transfer to. Instead of transferring to Ian, Jin Su could have transferred into Chao and then finished the kill of Jin Su. If this is late game, you've just eliminated two active players. Even extra props if, before all this, you'd left a full expo crew on a planet, killing another four players.</p><p>This tactic will probably end in the death of Jin Su as Chao, sadly, as any intelligent crew would put two and two together and kill him. But think of the twist ending!</p><p>More will come later, and more would be heartily appreciated. The Art of the Patsy is an ever growing art, namely, one that grows the more I think about ways to pin stuff on other players. Thank you very much for reading my guide, ladies and gentlemen, and keep Mushing.</p>

                <p>I at least generally do not kill inactives, and I've only noticed people who do random kills killing them either. If you leave inactives alone they will generally suicide, which is the perfect answer for humans aboard - as suicide doesn't affect other players' morale but any other form of death does. Tracking morale works for tracking when inactives should die (and is easy, as inactives are not doing anything that can throw the count off) - and if 1-2 inactives don't die when they should through morale loss or starvation then you know you need to help them die because they are mush. You still need to determine if you think that those inactives were the alpha mush or not - but it's far better than throwing AP into killing someone who is extremely unlikely to affect the game (inactive mush don't spike, sabotage, or anything... unless faking being inactive, and actually watching the game to decide when to strike). I'd be alarmed by anyone on my ships killing inactives 'early', because they're choosing to throw away AP that's needed for other things; may be showing that they are motivated to kill others (and view the natural inactive death a 'waste' because they could get the kill instead, have to hurry!), and expecially if that inctive turns out to be a mush - I'd suspect them for killing the inactive mush for their own personal credit.</p>

                <p><strong>Impet</strong>, wouldn't inactives die of starvation long before morale death? -Nevermind, that's off topic. I guess killing inactives quickly or waiting for them to starve is a matter of personal opinion. I'm sort of split on it myself. On one hand, it's pretty easy to wait. On the other hand, if we wait for them to die of starvation, and find out they don't die when they're supposed to... Well then what? Will I have to spend the rest of the cruise suspecting other crew members of just being anonymush? Sort of a tradeoff there. Chao has free shooter points anyways, it doesn't really cost him any AP. Potentially, it's a better choice to booby trap the inactives with mycoalarms. My previous ship actually <em>did</em> set up a mycoalarm watching over the inactive, and the only reason I wasn't caught and killed was because no one actually checked over the logs and saw the alarm go off.</p><p><strong>Cleef</strong>, thank you for your input on that. Like I said, I hadn't really had the chance to test it with an inactive, so I didn't know about the 'rudely awaken' thing inputted in.</p><p><strong>Tasd</strong>, as for your comment about it being an 'epic stupidest fail', I must note that this tactic isn't exactly news. A friend of mine commented that they'd done something similar themselves to good effect. Honestly, there are plenty of perks to transferring and not killing the old body. One of them is exactly as you mentioned, no one believes them. They'll die anyways just by nature of not being believed. Put yourself in their shoes, Tasd. Would it be better to stay silent knowing who the Mush is when you just transferred, or speak up and say that you're a prisoner in the new body, knowing no one will believe you because 'who would transfer and not kill old body yet obviously risk being detected because the room would record the killing because there's another person in the room'? Frankly, transferring and instant killing would be 'epic stupidest fail', to quote you.</p><p>Eleesha printing the list is an action that can be done whenever, and it only ever indicates alpha mush. I do not see how this has anything to do with what I said about sporing and taking anonymush.</p><p>Bananas, uncooked rations, pills, so on and so forth. If you were eating bananas and pills for no reason whatsoever without reporting it on ship log, there'd be ample reason to suspect you anyways. And if you're reporting it on ship log, you're in the exact same position.</p><p>I thank you for your input, though, Tasd. It's a game constantly growing and changing by tactics getting more and more creative. Frankly, the only way to see if they'll be effective is to either put them out in the open and discuss them, regardless of responses, or test them yourselves. Please continue to give input on further tutorials, Tasd, and bequeath your knowledge to players trying to share their own.</p>

                <p>Aaeni, it depends on if they're newbies who stopped the tutorial before eating or not - and on how many other crew deaths your ship has had in the early days. I've seen a lot of griefers, so some of my ships have had like 4 human deaths, and sometimes a mush death too by day 3 - and too people keep contacting sol before everyone's aboard, so some players start the game with their 7 morale and rapidly go down from there. I've seen a few suicides D3. A tutoral never-ate idler would die faster than that, but otherwise... depends on all the other factors.</p>

                <p>way too much is dependant on players reacting in a way that is useful to the mush, when players are very unpredictable and not so easily fooled either. not saying the transfer tactic could never work but it does seem a little far fetched, plus the mush tries to fake his actions but reacts in a way human players wouldn't anyway. unless they are complete nubs.</p><p>certainly not convinced from what I have read, +1 for effort and keep em coming.</p>

                <p>I think blaming someone else is pretty tricky. Unless you have proof that they have done something odd and suspicious... and even then, if they did, it wouldn't work to just go and say "Oh, look, that Chao hid something, he must be MUSH"...</p><p>Also, as said, inactives should never be killed. If they are mush, great, nothing to worry about since they won't do nothing and after day 5 you'll know which one aren't and which not.</p><p>Can't say anything on the transfer because I've never tried it, but if I did that I'd most likely use the "attack human-transfer-retaliation attack on old body" and blame it on "he tried to kill me!". Or from the other side, if someone did it to me and didn't kill me... well, I'd just grab a blaster and knife and take them out. Besides announcing it in public.</p><p>As a mush, I'm not one to blame others, because is extremely difficult to find reasons to do so. I mean, I've been in a ship with a Terrence that "got stuck" in storages room, lingered around the Nexus "because he was the admin", was always out of AP, wasted cook book (we didn't have a cook) "because he didn't know it got destroyed after use"... I thought a few times he was mush. Yet he wasn't. So... you know, placing suspicion on another is REALLY tricky. To me.</p><p>I'm more of the sort to lay low... do what I'm supposed to do, maybe spore someone who's where he shouldn't be (but not straying away too far away -Paola doesn't have any business in dorms and Kuan Ti nothing to do on Bridge-), hiding useful stuff, if I have the skill, booby-trap shelves. Also, even if I'm pretty active I just go in to check but ZERO talk or moving... just storing precious AP, waiting for the quiet time to move.</p><p>Anyway I'm pretty newbie myself, not experienced but that's my thoughts on it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Well, turning the most active player is by far a better tactic than turning inactives. You're leaving the ship crippled because now he/she will give out fake tips, and if you're active too you can coordinate something more elaborate. Also 3 mush can turn more than 2 mush.</p><p>Also sure, let them waste AP sucking spores. I mean, I haven't got a ship gone so far as spore-sucking, so I wouldn't know.</p><p>But going out with a grenade in the open is a nice way to get you killed early, and a grenade is not likely to kill anyone unless he/she has low HP.</p>

                <p>Most crews don't actually kill inactives. We leave them past day 4-5 and see who dies to morale/starvation. They're costly to kill and harmless as mush.</p><p>Don't convert inactives! Play to win. Convert the most active and then take anonymush. If you're playing with trapped shelves and food, they'll usually take anonymush themselves. If you two somehow mess it up and both of you take anonymush, people usually think that a formerly inactive mush suddenly got on and picked the skill. Especially if another mush has died recently.</p><br><p>Morale counting is very important if you're facing experienced mush hunters. I count morale. A lot of other players do and even set up spreadsheets for it. A skilled Eleesha will know who's in what room with Jin Su/Janice; this also makes Janice a great mush hunter.</p><br><p>Transfer tricks can be very difficult. You'll have to start off with an obviously mushy move - spore someone, attack someone. The hard part is convincing people that you found your talkie that the transferrer most likely hid. Do something dumb like hiding the talkie in front of an inactive in a corridor and stay silent until then.</p><p>You're also relying on a smart crew that knows what transfers are. A played-straight transfer may work better on a naive crew.</p><p>Let's say Eleesha here is a good mush hunter and has backed you up against a wall. Your obvious action would be to kill yourself and transfer into Eleesha. You throw a grenade, stab a few people, run across Eleesha.</p><p>If you tell them that you've just been transferred into, you're busted because you still have your walkie talkie. If you tell them nothing, they'll just kill you. What you have to do is set things up so that people expect a transfer. If you were playing a mush that was suspected enough, it's going to be hard to convince people. You should have set up an anti-mush channel by now, ideally one that's accusing your rival (Eleesha in this case). If she seems active and genuine, even volunteering to take a mush test, convince people into thinking that she'll transfer.</p><p>Even then, you're busted when they kill her and find out she's not mush. Your best bet then is to transfer into someone else (ideally the one with the knife) and accuse your former body of being mush. Or if you can't do that, just claim that you've been transferred into again.</p>

                <p>A lot of people seem to play the game very differently when they play Mush.</p><p>Personally, I've taken a 'Glory means nothing right now' sort of route. Which, really, it kind of doesn't. Face it, a Mush is probably never going to hit the ranking leaderboard because the highest they can get is probably around 200 (Though I've never confirmed nor tested it). So if ranking doesn't matter, then you're aiming for golden supernova. And supernova is based entirely off of glory, which, in this case, 'doesn't matter'. So often times when I'm mush, rather than do a bunch of risky things that'll get me detected and killed, I go for a technical victory of infecting Sol or something along those lines. It's usually way harder for a late game win for Mush anyways.</p><p><strong>Mr Muz</strong>, I never actually viewed it that way... Interesting. Thanks about the Morale hunting tip though, I had a feeling it was something that lots of people did, I just wasn't quite sure on it yet.</p><p>Regarding transfer tactics, I bow to the true master. I haven't actually gotten the chance to test much out with the skill, since I only recently got my Mush to level six, but I'm really excited to. Properly used, it seems like a skill that can really screw the crew.</p><p>Really, thanks to all of you for this. Mush seems like a game impossible to master like Die2nite because the more one person figures out and shares, the more tactics adapt and change on both sides. I get the feeling months and years from now it will be a very vicious game to new players to join in on.</p>

                <p>I think there are some situations where it can be good to convert an inactive. If your name is on the list and the inactive's name is on the list then converting them can draw suspicion off of you.</p><p>I agree about mush glory. Its far more fun to play for the long game than to destroy the ship in the first couple of days.</p>

                <p>It's easy to screw up, sure. But in my experience it's really not that hard to get it to work against an experienced crew. It's certainly got nothing to do with luck - it's solely about how good you are at manipulating your crew. Like any Mush strategy, whether or not you should DO it ultimately depends specifically on the people you are playing with and the opportunities that present themselves.</p><p>None of your counter-examples even really play into the situation I described - that being a "panic" situation where a Mush just killed someone else and is now "trying to kill you" that means things like investigation aren't really something you have time for.</p><p>Plenty of Mush will try to blame a kill on someone else, but that's really the smallest component of the "get crew to do things they shouldn't while panicking" strategy.</p>

So you'll need to go to a room without any witnesses present, extract a spore, return back, infect a victim, and have 2 Mush comrades to infect her too. And one of the big advantages of the transfer is that it is undetectable by cameras, while transfer/infect scenario would work only in a room without a camera. And if a target stands in a room without surveillance and you have 2 Mush sidekicks with spores - why not just convert a victim and take anonymush?</p>

                <p>Best way to infect a crew (IMHO) is to trap shelves. That way when the victim gets infected it will immediately take anonymush. You're still alpha, and probably suspected by now, but they don't know of the 3rd one. And THAT makes it easier.

                <p>LMAO, that's a nice turn in the ending. Pretty wicked tactic. My best tactic so far was spore a shelf with useful stuff so people HAS to check it. Even hid an extinguisher so detective Eleesha got suspicious on me. Of course, I was the main suspect by then, but having the main investigator on my side turned around the tides.<br>Then again, the fact that there was about 4 inactive did help a bit to ease the pressure, but still sporing was quite dangerous. Even more being Kuan Ti, and having to find an excuse to be dirty (my first one of fixing a door was also pretty suspicious).<br>By the time the ship was going to hell, I've already turned Eleesha, and she turned Jin Su. That left 3 active crew and other so-so... no one saw but the captain 2 meteors coming straight at us until they were mentioned 10 minutes before collision.</p>
