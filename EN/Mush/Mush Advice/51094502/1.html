                <p>I agree with the previous answers. When you see some weapons lieing openly why not just hiding them and informing Chun? you are not only preventing mushes using them, but also can deal quicker with them when they are busted. <br>There may be situations where you are in critical need of scrap and you may consider it so ship is surviving though.</p><p>Also that people kill inactives sounds not that bad if people have generally high morale and the inactives are in an unprotected area (they may get turned into mush when waiting too long) or are charcters like Derek and therefore transfer dangers.</p>
