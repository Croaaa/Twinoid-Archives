                <p>I'm trying to understand the mindset of these characters so I could roleplay them better and keep the personalities more consistent. Here's a very short summary of what I understand of these characters:</p><ul><li><strong>Kim Jin-Su</strong>: Great explorer. Good for people who want to roleplay as a guy who bosses around others and makes grand speeches. Somewhat arrogant, but justified by his celebrity status as a heroic survivor and experience with piloting and expeditions. He was one of the people who planned to build the Daedelus and launched it.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Frieda Bergmann</strong>: Nobel prizewinner astrophysicist. Humble person, more interested in space exploration than glory. Froze herself for 1024 years to meet this dream.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Lai Kuan-Ti</strong>: Genius spaceship designer. Designed a much larger spaceship than the Daedalus, which was not completed and retrofitted the design for a much smaller spaceship. Generally a cheerful, optimistic person.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Janice Kent</strong>: Robot psychologist, skilled with both AI and human psychology. She controls NERON like a lion tamer, making it more docile.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Roland Zuccali</strong>: Hyperactive prankster pilot. He's a bit of a naughty boy, often doing pranks and bending the rules. Quarantined for a prank gone wrong, escaped, joined with rebels, then joined up with the Daedelus as its best pilot.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Jiang Hua</strong>: Pilot for exploration ships. Her passion is extraterrestial biology and she drives the ships that land on planets. Rather unintuitively, she's not the best pilot on the ship - Jin Su and Roland are superior.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Paola Rinaldo</strong>: Rebellious young woman. Despite her degree in biology, she has experience setting up pirate radio stations and intercepting signals. Her father, <strong>Giole</strong>, pulled strings to get her on the Daedelus, so at least roleplay up a little compassion between the two.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Wang Chao</strong>: Erratic, elite fighter. He's one of the deadliest fighters in the universe, but generally assigned where he can't cause trouble. Has a knack for surviving in the worst conditions, but unpredictable.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Finola Keegan</strong>: Biologist. She is a compassionate person who tried to help prisoners and slaves dying to flu. Expert on Mush and vaccines. She was invited to join the Daedalus but didn't want to abandon the millions left on Sol, so they kidnapped her. Likely to be rather pissed when she wakes up from cryogenic sleep.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Stephen Seagull</strong>: Badass. He has lived a very exciting life, which included smuggling <strong>Paola</strong> to Mars. Has a criminal record and mercenary and sentenced to be executed. He's been a corrupt senator and a rebel. He was invited to the Daedelus as an 'eminent scientist', exposed, and escaped. He later on snuck onto the ship. Don't play him as "the Daedelus chef", but rather as a convict stowaway who just happens to know how to cook.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Ian Soulton</strong>: Botanist. He identified some of the first mush samples. He's generally a panicky guy who wants to save the world. I'd say the pacifism comes not so much from being a tree-hugging hippy, but from being phobic of violence. He planted the garden on the ship ensure oxygen, but much of the garden was destroyed by a fire when by the time he woke from cryosleep.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Zhong Chun</strong>: Survivor nurse. Lone survivor from a bad case of mush. Her body is regularly researched for hints on mush immunity. She switched to work as a maintenance operative to try and live a normal life. <strong>Eleesha</strong> brought her onto the Daedelus to help with vaccine production.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Raluca Tomescu</strong>: Autistic physics genius. Designed the Pilgred reactor and adopted the cat. One of the harder characters to roleplay right, she has difficulties communicating with people and expressing emotions. The cat is her only friend.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Gioele Rinaldo</strong>: Billionaire. Made his fortune on prisoner mining operations. Spent much of his money trying to build an Ark to Magellan's Cloud. Hired<strong> Jin Su</strong> and <strong>Kuan-Ti</strong> to do the job, and later discovers that they retrofitted the design into a smaller ship, the Daedelus. He offers to fund the new ship under condition that his daughter, <strong>Paola</strong>, is part of the ship.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Eleesha Williams</strong>: Reporter. Did a computer science degree but spent that time finding out how her father disappeared mysteriously. Has a phobia of flying. Has some slight suspicion on <strong>Jin Su</strong> who she secretly believes was responsible for her father's disappearance. Talkative, comfortable with interviewing people, and can be quite stubborn. Good for people who like to play as Mush hunters.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Terrence Archer</strong>: Soldier turned robotics engineer. He failed his first try at engineering, became a fighter pilot, and lost his legs when his plane exploded. He started engineering robotics again and became friends with <strong>Janice</strong> during his studies. His drones played a strong role in building the Daedelus.</li></ul>
