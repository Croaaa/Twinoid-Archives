                <p>I would like to start showing what the last casting ship with the <strong>D</strong>epartement of <strong>M</strong>ush <strong>R</strong>esearch found out about hunters.<br><span class="tid_wspoil">Was an intense ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">, SobiOne, Saboteur, you were great <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></span><br>I did participate there and I put many energy into coordinating it, still I don't think this research is fully finished.<br>Also when having time I would like to look and evaluate the data more, maybe some more things can be found out just by checking them fully. But when I don't start with such things, I forget about it and it will never be done <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In most cases (unless some trigger happy pilots intereferred <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ) we wanted to flee from hunters as often as possible while having Trail Minimizer to see whether we loose the hunters by moving or not.<br>I guess the results woudl be similar without TM, just with more hunters following instantly, but interesting would maybe a DMR ship without any moving at all and comparing the amount of hunters afterwards.</p><p>Attention, the text will be huge and also probably too much for the wiki, though maybe some details can be added there then.</p><p>What we found out:</p><p>1) It was rather a byproduct, but that's the <strong>counting order of all hunters:</strong><br><a href="http://www.pic-upload.de/view-28121143/counting_order.jpg.html" target="_blank">http://www.pic-upload.de/view-2812114...</a> (You can never see more than 17 hunters in space/from turret, hunter #18 until #x is hidden unless you kill hunters, so they move a position upward )<br>New hunters will ALWAYS appear after the old hunters, UNLESS they are special hunters, then the following is happening:</p><p><a href="http://www.pic-upload.de/view-28121123/count_2.png.html" target="_blank">http://www.pic-upload.de/view-2812112...</a><br>(The following is known already by many people): One hunter of each available type is shown at the right upper corner, even if they are new and in the order: normal hunter; arack; asteroid; d1000; trax; trading ship.<br>If you kill any of these types, the next hunter of the same type will replace them. <br>Since the oldest normal hunters was always in the top, also the oldest other hunter type will always be in the right upper corner!<br>(I remember the following question of the forum in the "dealing with hunters" thread:</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_4531158 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="4531158">Abinmorth</span></span><cite>is there a way to see which hunters are new and which are attacking at end of cycle? (other than marking them by wounding)</cite><p>So yes, look at the counting order, if you know how many hunters you had before the second wave showed up, you could kill the old ones first by just aiming at the oldest hunter (first position). As soon as you kill one, the next oldest will move up one position.</p><p>2) <strong>Lost hunters by moving the ship will catch up at one point.</strong><br>That you often have after moving less hunters than before moving, yes! But they will catch up later.<br>We did mark hunters by damaging them a bit and moved the ship.<br>What happened? After moving we got at first the hunter wave of the hunters we didn't loose by moving. So far so good. But with the next hunter wave afterwards we saw the same damaged hunters we lost by moving (in same order) again! <br>Well, we always moved with Trail Minimizer, but I personally don't think it has to do with TM, but is a general mechanic when you move the ship.<br>So, the hunters are not lost, but get delayed...and will appear again with next normal hunter wave which is about to happen. When this wave is coming...well, RNG <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>It even happened that this wave catched up after over one day.<br>Another <strong>interesting thing</strong> I want to look more into when having more time: Once we had 13 normal hunters, <strong>after moving</strong> we had 4 normal hunters (9 lost). <strong>We moved again</strong> and lost 3 of our 4 normal hunters. <strong>6 cycles later </strong> we got in the next hunter wave 9 of our known hunters (besides other hunter types)<br><strong>7 cycles</strong> later we got a hunter wave of only 3 normal hunters.<br>So it seems that when there are several movings not always all lost hunters will catch up at same time...</p><p>Btw, though our pilost sometimes killed hunters, our common fleeing from hunters when they showed up resulted into a wave of 67 hunters at day 20.</p><p>3) insights about the concept of hunter appearances:<br>I believe I know now the reason why normally hunters don't attack the cycle they are appearing. <br>When you flee from hunters, the hunters you didn't loose will always attack at the end of the cycle they are appearing. Furthermore after moving it seems to happen that you get asteroids with 5 cycles until impact and not 6 cycles.<br>Why is that?<br>I guess the moment you move, you are already at the new location. And the hunters you didn't loose and the hunters which were triggered by moving too, but invisible. Or they appear at end of this cycle.<br>So asteroids loose a charge and hunters loose the cycle they are pacifists.</p><p>4) Asteroids and D1000 do never follow.<br>We did mark them too before fleeing from them, but at least D1000 and Asteroids didn't catch up at any point.</p><br><p>_________________________________________________________________________</p><p>There are several other things, but I want to look at them again, for example when and how many hunters are triggered by moving. It MAY be that with TM you get 1/4 of the whole hunter contingent which is following you currently or is about to appear with next hunter wave.<br>It seems sure though at least that you get not generally MORE hunters by moving, when many hunters were triggered (so you have equal amount or even higher amount after moving), then the contingent of hunters was already big (because no hunters showed up for days or hunters followed us currently).<br>Though I am not sure what is about the arack and trax. In the later days you get almost every wave arack and trax, also when just normal hunters are following you.<br>If you really trigger additional hunters (and not just hunters from the contingent) by moving, then only such special hunter types.</p><p>As conclusion for now I would say that Fleeing seems to be good to reduce the amount of hunters for a while, so pilots can kill them more easily, but in the end they will always catch up.<br>In other words... a ship without pilots is doomed in the long run.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">I hope people are understanding what I am talking about </span></p>

This works perfectly as intended, and without a doubt.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/less.png" alt=":mush_less:" class="tid_ico"> Escaping hunters divides their number by two, or by four with Trail Minimizer. This also works as intended. The escape mechanism was designed long before the game opened and was tested on countless ships, including by the devs. One of them said that she usually escaped hunters rather than fighting them, and if it had been bugged, she would have noticed, and so would players. We do see people complaining <strong>occasionally</strong> that they get identical bigger waves after escaping. But when something is bugged, you don't get occasional reports over a few years, you get dozens of reports over a few days or weeks.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/less.png" alt=":mush_less:" class="tid_ico"> The size of hunter waves increases with time, but also according to the crew's activity (the number of AP spent), the size of the previous waves, and other factors that are less clear (maybe the pilots' reactivity, how efficient they are or how fast they react). Chance also plays a part in the generation of hunters (and other obstacles). That is also true, at least the part about the influence of time and of the previous decisions of the RNG. Waves (not their daily number, but their size) increase regularly, although not always continuously. They will be bigger and bigger, but sometimes, due to chance, you can have more hunters one day, or several waves, even without moving. And we all know that one day without hunters is a bad sign and means that a much bigger wave will be coming the next day. Then things usually come back to normal during the following days.</p><br><p>Now, a few observations (and theories) :</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/less.png" alt=":mush_less:" class="tid_ico"> Moving the ship almost always triggers a new wave. That is also a fact that we have all noticed <em>(although I'm having a very weird casting ship which has almost always zero hunters after moving, and yet we're on D12, but that's the first time ever I've seen that happen)</em>. My explanation is close to Sperbi's. I think that it's an unintended consequence of the escape mechanism : the game is programmed to divide hunters by two when the ship escapes. So, when she ship moves, the RNG thinks that it is escaping. It invents a wave (that we don't see, since it's mid-cycle and invented), and then divides it. That explanation is a theory, but there is evidence for it :</p><ul><li>those waves are usually smaller than the regular waves, sometimes just 2 or 3 hunters.</li><li>as Sperbi also said, the impact of those asteroids is 5 cycles and hunters attack at the next cycle change (which proves that they are one cycle "younger" than they seem).</li><li>the same thing happens when you escape hunters : they attack at the next cycle change, not after 2 cycles.</li><li>also similar : the way Strateguru triggers. A <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/4/0/db254a9c_516.jpg">normal wave</a> is generated at the beginning of the new cycle (here, at the beginning of D13C1, with the gain of AP, MP, glory, plant production, etc.). <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/d/f/9c7a4b38_516.jpg">When the ship moves</a> (either to escape or just to move to or from a planet), hunters appear at the end of the previous cycle, just before cycle change. You can also have a <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/b/9/0d53e31a_516.jpg">double wave</a>, with <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/1/9/8a93b26d_516.jpg">two announcements</a>. This explains why sometimes waves seem identical or bigger : in fact, they are the combination of a reduced old wave (re-generated and calculated before cycle change) and of a new one (generated after).</li></ul><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/less.png" alt=":mush_less:" class="tid_ico"> The consequence, as npfan said, is that if you often move the ship into and out of orbit, hunters will be much more manageable, for several reasons :</p><ul><li>you get small waves after moving.</li><li>they are taken into account when the RNG generates the normal waves, which also makes them smaller.</li></ul><p>Most ships that went for Eden or tried can testify of that. If the ship moves constantly, there are always hunters around, but rarely big waves. Huge waves mostly appear when the ship stops exploring and therefore moves less often or not at all.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/less.png" alt=":mush_less:" class="tid_ico"> As for the fact that hunters catch up with the ship, I am not completely sure that you have proven it. You did prove that old, damaged hunters show up. But it can mean two things :</p><ul><li>when you escape, old hunters eventually catch up with the ship and increase the size of waves ;</li><li>or the waves increase (more or less) regularly, as intended, and include old hunters but are not especially bigger.</li></ul><p>Numbers from several ships would be necessary to show which is true.</p><p>Aall in all, I disagree about escaping. Of course, it depends on the number of pilots, and it's also different if you explore a lot. But for a ship that mostly stays still and has two or three pilots, I have always found that the best technique in later days is to kill aracks and trax, move, and kill the rest. It always means less hunters to kill and I have rarely noticed a significance or abnormal increase, except when there are no hunters at all for one or two days. But in that case, the sudden increase is due to the total absence of hunters for 8 cycles or more, and to the RNG catching up to the average.</p><p>As for Trail Minimizer, since it merely improves an existing mechanism, it has no side-effect. It just decreases the number of hunters that eventually catch up.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Sorry for the wall of text (and I still have a couple of things to add, so second post incoming <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">). </span></p>

It is irregular, but the RNG regulates itself more or less <strong>on average</strong>. As an additional note, that ship only did 3 expos in 20 days, so those figures are almost all "normal" waves.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/less.png" alt=":mush_less:" class="tid_ico"> About the accusation that Trail Minimizer or escaping makes waves bigger and not smaller : a <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/2/b/f3bc0184_516.jpg">screenshot</a> showing that a first wave of 34 hunters, after escaping or moving, was combined with an additional wave (a normal one, since the asteroid had a 6 cycle impact). Then, after escaping again, the wave was reduced drastically.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/less.png" alt=":mush_less:" class="tid_ico"> I did not include aracks, trax, D1000s and asteroids, since they all have particular mechanisms. But AFAIK they work as intended, except for D1000s which only fire once per cycle, at cycle change.</p><br><p><cite>After moving we got at first the hunter wave of the hunters we didn't loose by moving. So far so good. But with the next hunter wave afterwards we saw the same damaged hunters we lost by moving (in same order) again! </cite> As I asked, was that next hunter wave significantly bigger, or did it seem more or less normal ?</p><p><cite>So, the hunters are not lost, but get delayed...and will appear again with next normal hunter wave which is about to happen. When this wave is coming...well, RNG</cite> Same question. Are they <strong>added</strong> to that wave or <strong>included</strong> ?</p><br><p><cite>I believe I know now the reason why normally hunters don't attack the cycle they are appearing. </cite> Actually, what you show here is the reason why "abnormal" hunters attack the cycle they appear.</p><br><p><cite>Though I am not sure what is about the arack and trax. In the later days you get almost every wave arack and trax,</cite> There are rarely more than 2 or 3 of each at a time, unless you let trax follow you and new trax keep joining the old ones.</p><br><p><cite>In other words... a ship without pilots is doomed in the long run.</cite> That's obvious, but a ship without pilots can survive longer if they escape instead of letting hunters fire at them continuously. It's better to be attacked by 3 or 6 hunters than by 12... And a ship without any pilots cannot survive much anyway. I doubt that many pilot-less ships make it past D5.</p><br><p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_6684189 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="6684189">NERON</span></span><cite>The average ship doesn't understand how it works so it's usually harmful. I would categorize using TM/ hunter evasion "properly" under advance player techniques. If you're just a casual player who doesn't want to read the walls of text I linked, I suggest you simply avoid doing this altogether. Keep in mind that you'd also need the captain and other crew to either read the thread or agree to do what you suggest without understanding it themselves. This is much harder than it sounds</cite> I completely agree about the fact that the pilots and the commander need to understand how hunters work. Too many people think that piloting just means "jump into a patrol ship and kill everything in sight as soon as hunters appear". Others might think that you always need to escape, while it's not always necessary. You have to adapt your decisions to the number of pilots and their current AP, the number of hunters, whether you're going to move soon or not. And yes, it is sometimes very frustrating because pilots don't read the instructions and end up screwing things up.</p><p>But I don't get how hunter evasion can be so harmful. <strong>Not</strong> evading them seem more harmful to me if you don't have enough pilots, if they're not active enough, or if there are too many hunters.</p>

In that case, escaping will eventually harm you since it only delays the attack of hunters, which don't disappear completely and <strong>increase</strong> the number of hunters you would have without moving.</li><li>In the second hypothesis, you only get 12 hunters the next day, <strong>including</strong> old, damaged hunters. In that case, there is no harm done, since waves still follow a regular pattern.</li></ul><p>That's why I asked about numbers, and why the test should be carried on several ships. It is true that we can get huge waves in later days, but it can be due to the fact that there were one or two days without hunters, to the fact that the crew has stopped exploring and generating smaller waves...</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Hrmpf, Spacey, you beat me to it.</span></p>

                <p>I have currently not much time, so I hope it is fine if I say only something to some points. It was written quiete much in mean time.</p><br><p>Why hunters will always follow up and may be added to normal wave:</p><br><p>It is not only the fact that the damaged hunters appear again.</p><p>Unfortunately we had some trigger happy people and I could crie, shout , do whatever I wanted and they just didn't listen to my wishes. So we didn't always flee from hunters, sometimes even whopping 15 or 20 were killed. <br>Anyway, we still escaped OFTEN from hunters . I thank you for the number of that d20 ship.<br>Keep in mind that we mostly never escaped from all hunters, also aracks and trax were mostly shot down, so the following wave was not always bigger, but often in similar amount of hunters!</p><p>so my numbers of hunters just for the days (I don't consider hunters here showing up after moving, when hunters arrived with ship not moving and there were several waves, I added them; ): day is always first number, hunters is second number.</p><p>day hunters<br>1 4 <br>2 0 <br>3 20 (we had 5 previously from moving without hunters, few time later we had 15 more)<br>4 0 <br>5 8 (from moving with no hunters)<br>6 24 <br>7 21 (shootloving people killed them all against my wish &gt;.&lt;<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>8 7 <br>9 3 <br>10 8 <br>11 20 <br>12 12 <br>13 19 <br>14 23 <br>15 0 <br>16 38 <br>17 68 (around 34 2 times at day while moving between them, but not occuring at following cycles)<br>18 0 moving every cycle, getting always around 10 hunters after each moving<br>19 0 10 following hunters, shot down<br>20 67 <br>21 92 (one time around 50 - 2 announcements, some movings later aroudn 42, 2 announcements again)<br>22 12 no hunters appeared, created by moving with no hunters</p><p>sum: 446 (your example had until d20: 237; on dmr ship sum until d20 is 342)<br>I think that higher number is because</p><br><p>I agree with you Peanutz, that moving is per se not bad, but let me explain the mechanism with some examples:</p><p><em>example 1</em>:</p><p>you had for several days no hunters.<br>Especially in beginning as rule of a thumb you can expect that every cycle one hunter should show up, every cycle no hunter is showing up, they accumulate. This is only rule of thumb though...</p><p>so after several cycles with no hunters you move and recognize 5 hunters at new location.<br>Attention! you know now that several more hunters will show up soon.<br>A part of them got reduced by your moving, so with TM you can expect up to 15 more hunters in the contingent (5 hunters is 1/4 of 20 hunters), about to arrive in next normal wave.</p><p>If you move again with that contingent following you, it can happen:<br>a) you killed the 5 hunters before moving, hunters of the following contingent were about to appear at end of cycle, because triggered by moving, but get reduced by moving, so only part of them arrives after moving and other part gets delayed again.<br>Doing this you reduced contingent and created hunter waves you can kill easily with pilots.</p><p>b) you didn't kill the 5 hunters before moving, after moving you may have almost same amount or more hunters, because the hunters of contingent were considered too before hunter reduction, part of reduced hunters will be delayed<br>c) you didn't kill the 5 hunters and after moving 2 announcements may happen. That means <br>you get additionally a normal hunter wave whioch may include all hunters of contingent (but not necessarily)</p><p>If you don't move while knowing that contingent may appear, you will get with next hunter wave around 15 hunters!</p><p><em>example2</em>:</p><p>let's say all hunters of the whole contingent arrive:</p><p>You got 30 hunters and move one time; <br>you have 15 hunters afterwards. <strong>30-15= 15 lost hunters are about to appear again one point in game, random time! </strong>Now you move again;<br>you have around 8 hunters afterwards (<strong>15-8= 7 lost hunters are about to appear again one point in game, random time!</strong>;</p><p>you move again;<br>lets say you got <br>a) 4 hunters:<br>you can deal with them.<br>Some cylce laters it may happen that you get around 15 hunters and even later around 7 hunters, maybe even order can change or you get already 15+7=21 hunters together!</p><p>b) you got more than 4 hunters: <strong>because parts of the lost hunters you lost were about to appear too</strong>, for example the 15 arrived, but got reduced again from moving, so maybe you get (8+15)/2 hunters = 11 or 12.</p><p>c) you got 2 announcements and more than 4 hunters, so a normal hunter wave with one pacifist cycle appeared at begin of the cycle additionnaly to hunters which did not get reduced.</p><p><strong>The higher the amount of hunters in the contingent, the more likely is b and c</strong>:</p><p><em>example 3</em>:<br>you always moved away from hunters for days and never killed hunters in exception of aracks. Now you are getting an announcement of 40 hunters and you move away:<br>It is very likely that it only happens:<br>b) you get around 10 hunters with TM after EVERY consecutive moving, no matter how often you try it (TM: 25% of 40 hunters = 10)<br>c) you get 2 announcements and you have again around 40 hunters after moving, since the hunters of contingent appeared as normal wave after moving.</p><p>This mechanism is difficult to see and prove since you never know whether at moving parts of contingent was considered or not/and time of hunter delay may be days....</p><p>conclusion is:<br>So it is nice to move regularily when no hunters are about to appear to create a hunter wave your pilots can manage and to reduce your following hunter contingent.<br>But if you can't kill hunters, you can never flee from hunters forever, at one point you get always same amount or more hunters after every moving and the hunter contingent is just more and more increasing.</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_516 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="516">Peanutz</span></span><cite>Actually, what you show here is the reason why "abnormal" hunters attack the cycle they appear.</cite><p>I mean, if hunters would not have a pacifist cycle, we would have after ship moving already a damaged hull since the following hunters appeared already at end of cycle and woudl shoot then, if they had no pacifist cycle.<br>This is a necessary feature, so even after moving the hull will not be already damaged.<br>If there are 2 announcements after moving, then the hunters of the second announcement won't shoot, they appeared at begin of cycle, right.</p>
