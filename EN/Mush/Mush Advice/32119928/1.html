                <p>There needs to be a guide for playing as a Mush. As it stands, it's far too easy for a Mush to reveal themselves by taking actions that appear to be harmless. The in-game tool-tips do not tell you enough, and certainly not enough to survive. And I'm not willing to rely on Google translate for tips from the French language wiki. That just gives me a headache.</p><p>Here is my accumulated knowledge so far. I'm certain it is lacking in many ways, but it might serve to help a first time Mush be a bit more effective.</p><p><em>Any</em> Mush actions you do around people or cameras or drones will reveal you;<br>It takes 3 spores to convert a human;<br>You can only carry 2 spores on you at a time;<br>Spore creation is limited per day, and it is a team affair. Each spore your fellow Mush create in a given <em>day</em> (not cycle) is one less you can create;<br>You can only infect someone once per day, which the infect tool tip does not bother to tell you. So even saving up your 2 spores is not any guarantee that you'll be able to convert a human who is already infected.</p><p>The Mush form is nigh useless. It cannot infect, sabotage, see the human chat channel, carry objects, do anything with a storage bin (eat, infect, pick up, anything);<br>Do you think that the Phagocyte skill (eat a spore, gain 4 AP and health) is great? Guess again: It cannot be used in Mush form! This skill seems to be tailor made to preserve the life of a mutated Mush, and yet it <em>cannot be used</em> if you mutate.</p><p>It's actually easier to list the things the Mush form <em>can do</em> :<br>"Kick off" (attack) with a 60% accuracy and no particular damage bonus that 2-3 crew members don't already have;<br>See the Mush channel;<br>See the room log;</p><p>That's it. You lose <em>all</em> of your human and <em>all</em> of your Mush skills. If you have spores saved up, they become useless.</p><p>Why anyone would ever mutate, I don't know, and yet there it sits at the top of your action list, beckoning to you as if it was a good option. You're far better off grabbing the Blaster or the Knife and shooting or swinging away, more so if you're one of the several characters with a special aptitude for shooting or H-T-H combat.</p><p>My best advice for Mush (and take it with a large grain of salt, since I've never been very successful) would be to be <strong>very</strong> patient. Build your spores up, using eating food or research as a cover for becoming dirty. You'll then have to shower, which will wound you unless you take the special skill that lets you shower without taking damage. Use the Trapper skill or the food infecting skill (don't recall the name) to infect random humans. And then try to find one of them alone and coordinate with your fellow Mush to infect them directly.</p><p>Sabotage is very suspicious to players unless it takes place very late in the game, Day 6+. So that's not a great option, unless you can blame someone else for it.</p><p>Other than that, keep quiet and play your usual role on the ship. Take any opportunity to be helpful as this will 'prove' your human nature, but don't be a very active player.</p><p>Or go whole hog and be totally active, calling out anyone you can for anything you might be able to construe as a Mush-like action, to stir the pot and keep suspicion on as many people as you can. Sometimes just saying that you think someone is a Mush will be enough to get another player to kill them, and that's a win-win for team Mush.</p><p>Me, I think that it's a shame that a Mush win essentially requires poor play on the human side. Any coordinated human team will very quickly complete researches which limit the Mush capabilities. If they do not, then the Mush don't really have to do much of anything, the humans will have proven themselves incompetent either through inactivity or inept play and the ship will run out of O2 or fall apart without a lot of help from the Mush being required.</p><p>I don't think that requiring either incompetence on the human side or a 'political win' is a good mechanic for the game. But that's just me.</p>

                <p>I believe we we were on same ship. It was huge disappointment when Mush can't even use spore to infect if he is in final form...</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">After they got you I switched with Kuan Ti and they didn't notice it and killed Gioele so actual Kuan Ti was killed. Now its a matter of time till they get me as they know who am I...</span></p><p>Also dunno if its a bug or intended but there is 100% sure way to find out who is mush. Mush can only eat once (dunno what is time frame for that). So active ship can make everyone eat pill/coffee then try eat food. These actions will be shown in log if room has camera or another person in it. Mush will not be able to eat food after eating pill/coffee. Any person who refuse must be mush. This should be changed. Mayme add new status? So you can consume pill/coffee and food same day?</p><p>And this is pretty easy cos ship starts with decent amount of drugs and food. And even tho eating early is considered bad all that AP can be used well to give ship early start better.</p>

                <p>Well, fatal flaw in that I could only infect once. I had 2 spores, you had 1. The plan was to use the 3 spores to turn the person. But then I couldn't infect him again.</p><p>And I mutated after that because I knew I was discovered (the human posted my camera sabotage to the standard chat) and thought the mutate form would be an awesome combatant. Turns out it's more like a milquetoast combatant. I should have picked up the blaster and used that before mutating.</p><p>But that's the reason for my post: Mush don't know what Mush should know. That's poor game design, unless it's <em>intentional</em> to make people learn through trial and error.</p><p>The same applies on the human side. It takes at least 2 times as a particular character to learn the role. There's no good reason for this. But there are a lot of posts about that already, I've just never seen one for the Mush.</p>

Mush can only eat once (dunno what is time frame for that). So active ship can make everyone eat pill/coffee then try eat food. These actions will be shown in log if room has camera or another person in it. Mush will not be able to eat food after eating pill/coffee. Any person who refuse must be mush. This should be changed. Mayme add new status? So you can consume pill/coffee and food same day?</cite><p>When a mush eats anything, the mush is 'full' for two cycles.</p><p>As for mutate, it's a move of final resort. A mutated mush gains the ability to automatically guard rooms and I believe also absorbs 1 point of damage, but loses pretty much everything else.</p>

The humans have other problems other than Mushes, the Mushes are just their main problem. If we were to have Mushes buffed, the humans would not be able to handle with all these factors.</p>

                <p>The mush have to do their human jobs as well as try to take over the ship and not get caught. If you ignored your human responsibility you are seen to be a mush very, very fast. So mush have to "waste" AP on things like hunters, comms, projects etc just like the humans do. I would say the odds are heavily stacked against mush when you get humans who know what they are doing.</p>

                <p>I totally agree that having a mechanic where Humans can insist everyone eat a pill and a food to sniff out the Mush simply destroys all play possibility for the Mush side. On my last ship they tried this but luckily for mushy me they only tested a few humans. Don't know why they stopped before they got halfway through, but I was not caught. On my current ship I did not suggest this method even though I was human because it seems like abuse of game mechanics to me.</p>

For example, had I known that I could only infect a human once per Day or perhaps Cycle or perhaps ever (I still don't know which it is), I would not have revealed myself by spiking a human when I had 2 spores and my fellow Mush had 1 spore, working off of the only known information which the game provides: That it cost 1 AP to take that action. I had plenty of AP.</p><p>And another example: you lose all of your Mush skills when you mutate. So I lost the second spore that I had risked discovery to create, and could not infect a different human with it, nor eat it for Health and AP via the skill which grants that ability, nor Trap a storage bin or piece of food. Would it really be <em>some horrible advantage</em>, to actually tell the Mush what happens when they mutate, or to tell them the unstated limitations of the actions available to them?</p><p>And relying on multiple plays to build experience is a pretty stupid reason to have vague, incomplete, or misleading information.</p><p>And I'm just <em>loving</em> the "Don't ever talk on the Mush channel, you'll be identified by the number of characters in your character's name" discussion. Seriously, here's this special communications method provided for the Mush and the best advice is to leave it unused and (I assume) open a private channel for coordinate your efforts. Brilliant!</p>

I'm not saying you're wrong, just that this shortcoming is not as detrimental as you're making it out to be. You are correct that the <em>reasons</em> for things in the game are not always explicitly mentioned, and that is a valid critique of the system. The mush tooltips do give you some of the information you ask for, e.g., the Mutate option does state that you can only really attack things in that form, but they do not cover everything.</p><p>I don't know if you've been playing the Hearthstone beta, but that game, much like Mush, is primarily tooltip driven. It has the advantage of being a card game with definitive text attributes assigned to cards; however, a lot of the ways that cards interact in that game are not documented anywhere. And that game is produced by one of the biggest studios in the world.</p><p>What I hear you asking for is a manual, like they had in the old days, or at least a wiki. There's a number of people asking for that, and it will eventually happen. But that will require people to experiment and write it down. I'm working on a guide to be placed in the Mush Advice forum to get the ball rolling. You would like the devs to provide more comprehensive guidance (in-game? on the help pages?), but I don't know likely or necessary that is.</p>

                <p>Enfilade, you and I are just going to have to agree to disagree. In the first part, you allow that I have a valid criticism of the poor tool tips, and then you go into a long description of how some other game does things (irrelevant!), you describe a tool tip inaccurately to make it seem less useless than it is, and then sum up by saying that a wiki (player created!) is coming and all will be better then.</p><p>Your logic is simply ass-backwards, your details are inaccurate, and by suggesting that a player created wiki will solve all these problems is actually only supporting the problems that I've been detailing all along:</p><p><strong>The game was so poorly designed and documented that it requires weeks or months of experimentation to fully understand.</strong> And this lack of documentation (if a few expanded tool tips can be graced with that label) is unfairly weighted towards the Mush side.</p><p>No human player is going to be murdered because they went into an exhausted Turret and discovered that they could not fire it, but there are <em>multiple ways</em> an inexperienced Mush player can inadvertently reveal themselves..</p><p>The game designers could <em>very easily</em> have added (or could still add) a few sentences to a few tool tips and solved all of the problems I have described. That you feel that a player created wiki is the correct solution to that shortcoming is simply anathema to my way of thinking.</p>

What, all of them? And by that point, you've already read a lot of "Hide X" suggestion, it doesn't add anything to what you know.</p>

                <p>IMO Mush is too unfriendly to casual gamers. It's just unfinished. It's playable for relatively hardcore gamers who love discovering new funny games. But masses are rather casual, not hardcore. (sorry for my bad English)</p>

                <p>As a new player, I have to agree with the criticism related to the lack of tooltips. And not just tooltips in general, but also the lack of information, stop. The help isn't any help.</p><p>I thought that when I leveled up, I could pick a second skill for Roland (pilot instead of sprinter). But now I realize that I can only do it before joining a ship. I was not the only one to do that in my ship.</p><p>I can understand the argument for discovering secrets, and that's fine. You don't have to spill out all the details and leave some for experimentation. However, you have to consider that this is a very slow paced game, a simple action takes literal <em>hours</em>. Dying because of a detail you didn't know (but really should have, such as the spore limit)? That's just poor, unfriendly and is a surefire way to deter people from replaying.</p><p>I came here looking for an interesting version of die2nite, but this thread did not spark up my hopes.</p>

                <p>Agreed with above. As a new player trying to learn how to play the game, it is very frustrating not to have seemingly basic information available to you on the basic mechanics of the game (let alone the basic strategies). This is very bad design.</p><p>The enjoyment from a game should come from being able to interact with its systems and each other in a meaningful manner. If you take away people's ability to act in a sensible and meaningful way, you remove any sense of gameplay.</p><p>Waiting 3 hours for an AP, then wasting it on something that could have very easily been told to you beforehand (or worse, losing your Mushy life for lack of a tool-tip) is indefensible.</p>

                <p>I agree with many of the sentiments mentioned in this thread. To start with they really should have had n English Wiki for this game right at the release date, the fact that they don't shows poor planning. <br>And I also agree that the lack of tips for Mush Players is atrocious, perhaps they want the game to be easy for Human Players till everyone gets the hang of it?</p><p>I personally think it would be great fun to be a Mush, assuming you know what you are doing.<br>Thankfully with the OPs thread, they have explained many of the various points and issues on how to play Mush, ensuring then when I inevitably get picked as one, I will have a good idea on how to survive and maybe even win. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Kompera, the reason Mush are at such a disadvantage is that they probably aren't really considered the 'main characters' by the devs. <br>In die2nite (please don't hit me) there are ways to become a 'ghoul', which pretty much grants the player the ability to gain a kind of currency by eating other players in their town (which is slightly inconvenient for the other player). From my perspective on this game (Mush) and die2nite, they are deranged half-cousins 36 times removed (with an axe). Thus it may follow that the Ghoul vs normal citizen dynamic carries over to Mush. If you have played die2nite and understand the game mechanics regarding ghouls you'll probably find it suspiciously similar (like, a lot) to Mush vs. Human interactions... Actually if you don't see the parallel you were not beaten nearly enough as a child. <br>In other (less bumbling) words, Mush (the game) was probably (almost definitely) based off die2nite, and Mush (the characters) were based on Ghouls. Ghouls in die2nite are meant to be nearly impossible to play as without being detected and easy to deal with (most of the time). This is how Mush is designed (I presume. I still suck). The aliens have a small chance of winning because of their origin (if the crew knows what it's doing), and because they are only a part of the obstacles the main characters' way.<br>Now you may be saying "I didn't choose to be a Mush - I'm not a ghoul, so I should have a chance." Well, it may very well be that MT is planning to change the game such that you'll get your chance. Would that be fair? Arguably yes. Is it likely that this change will occur? Bzzt. MT's track record for implementing PvP balancing is poor unless there is monetary incentive. I don't even need to reference other games for you to know that's true. Why would they be any different this time around?<br>Plus, changing the design of the game to focus on the Mush potentially winning against active, cooperative players involves changing the core of the game, the whole basis. The development of the game, in every language, would have to ignore updates and other ways to make money off new players to focus on creating a balance that I doubt they ever wanted to begin with. Do you have so much faith in MT? I don't. Not since Hammerfest. And that was a hell of a long time ago.</p>

The Mush have a lot of abilities, and a knowledgeable Mush player can probably give the Human players fits.</p><p>Unfortunately the reason the Mush are at such a disadvantage is that they can, out of ignorance due to the poorly written and almost non-existent documentation plus the inadequate tool tips for their abilities, quite easily take an action which reveals them almost immediately and gets them killed.</p><p>Add this short lifespan to the the fact that a player will, on average, be a Mush only one ship in eight, and you have a <em>very</em> steep learning curve for the Mush.</p><p>And for all those ships where the Mush are killed on Day1 due to inadvertently revealing themselves, the game becomes a space version of D2N. It's just the players against the environment, struggling to survive the Hunters, broken equipment, fires, and depleting O2 and food supplies. Wow! What a unique concept!</p><p>All the massive amount of hype about the unique PVP environment, suspenseful play, and the hunt to discover who the Mush are goes right out the window. Really, the hype is simply enormous. Read some of the reviews and you'll see what I mean. I have to wonder about the competence of the reviewers, however, as any good game reviewer ought not be afraid to call a turd a turd when they step in one. And yet of the several reviews I've read the worst criticism I've seen is that the game is more fun when the players are active. What an insightful conclusion!</p><p>And <em>all it would take</em> to eliminate this would be about two dozen lines of better documentation in the Help area and perhaps one more sentence for each Mush ability tool-tip. Really, it would be that simple to fix this problem. Perhaps 4 hours of a tech writer's time who is familiar with the mechanics of the game. Maybe 8 hours time total if the tech writer needs to bug the developers for information due to being unfamiliar with the mechanics.</p><p>As you say, MT has a very poor rep when it comes to game balance. Otherwise we wouldn't see D2N (you brought up D2N, not me!) meta-towns with zero Scavengers, exactly 2 Shaman (just to hedge against the early death of one of them in the endgame, gotta keep collecting those souls!), and 10-15 Guardians.</p><p>But I'm not sure that Mush would be so terribly unbalanced were the Mush players able to jump into their first game as a Mush with the same knowledge that it might take 4+ ships as a Mush to accumulate through a very long and painful trial and error method.</p>

                <p>I've only been on one ship and confident I can play Mush with some level of competence. so yes I do think you are making a mountain out of a molehill Kompera. Learning the game currently is more difficult than it was in beta admittedly, but it doesn't mean you can't learn, and if anything, it's a load easier on the Mush right now, giving them a sandbox to test stuff.</p>

The Mush have a lot of abilities, and a knowledgeable Mush player can probably give the Human players fits..</p></cite><p>The paranoia is solely on the side of the humans, as the Mush know who the other Mush is. I could just be a dull bulb, but I don't see how human paranoia being a priority necessarily gives priority to balancing the success of both parties (Mush vs humans). Especially when considering that techniques like the one below may be birthed from paranoia.<br>The 'Mush Test' (where you get people to eat a pill and then food) sounds pretty unbalanced to me. Is there any real way to get around that other than ignoring the chat and going on a kamikaze mission right away? That's not really a way out imo, as you still end up just being a small factor of annoyance with no hope of winning yourself (unless other people are doing the same, which means you're on a newbie ship... Which is most of the time atm. Anyway, you need to rely on ignorance from the human side for that to work anyway).<br>You also criticized the Mush chat. I don't think you want an extended tooltip for this one saying "don't use this" in red letters, but instead make it so that it's potentially useable. I'm just assuming again though :/</p><p>Overall, I really don't see much difference between the chances of ghoul survival in die2nite vs Mush chances in... Mush. There are obviously a lot of similarities in terms of how you play them (they're identical, practically), but I'm going further as to say that to an experienced crew, Mush are no harder to deal with than ghouls in an experienced town. With this (and things like the mush test in mind) I'm arguing (though I'm too crappy of a writer to say it implicitly) that Mush = Ghouls in terms of design and priority in terms of whether they should win. I don't see (from your post, or others) any reason to think otherwise. Perhaps this is just a matter of opinion/experience though :/</p><p>I should probably (as in definitely) read the rules, but I don't know if a Mush backstabbing its own kind and helping the crew is illegal, as this is often (being optimistic) what a ghoulified person will do when he's in a coalition. Although if a Mush DID start collaberating with the rest of the crew it might be hard to catch him/her if the Mush was just PMing chun and she supported his actions... Anyway, I was going somewhere with this in terms of an argument but I forgot what that was ^^". Sometimes I learn by writing - it's weird...</p>

                <p>Read the rules, and apparently you can't backstab your own kind but there's nothing about just helping the crew like a ghoul would help a town in die2nite... The only catch is that you can't "publicly denounce" yourself? Does that mean someone can PM and say that they're Mush and they want to help? If so that might be how some caste Mush play - sacrifice their own interests so the whole crew gets awarded for going to Sol or Eden.</p>

                <p>The Mush, for having a game named after them and also being the main vehicle for ingame drama, seem to be sadly dysfunctional.</p><p>Even if the 'pill-food' test did not work, the game at my limited experience and knowledge, does not seem to support the kind of bluffing and subtlety that should be in the core of the gameplay for the mush, and the kind of wariness and paranoia for the humans.</p><p>Instead, mush are seemingly constrained doing random bits of harm or spreading spores, but the existence of Cameras and detailed logs by certain crewmembers makes this close to impossible, and the end result quite questionable in efficacy. With the insistence of 3 spores for an infection, or even 4 with some research (that is already under way even before Mush are on the ship!), the mush are really hard pressed to find opportunities to spread them. Add to this the fact that the help is very poor, and one mistake can cost you your life very easily because of the over vigilant humans.</p><p>So the gameplay seems to, as someone pointed out earlier, to whittle down to just surviving and managing the <span class="tid_strike">colony</span> ship as per in D2N, instead of constantly being on guard and wary of your crewmembers. With the difficulty the mush have even achieving their most base objectives, due to the dirty proof aprons and mush sample readily available way before mush even have a chance to squelch and with the mutated mush being next to useless, it's really hard to be afraid of the titular enemy. If you get infected, you are either playing really badly or what is more likely, you just got very unlucky at being at the wrong place at the wrong time, giving the rare opportunity for a mush to infect you. I mean, think about it: the mush are limited to spore production per <em>day</em> and they can only carry <em>two </em>spores at once to infect a human who needs <em>three</em>... handicapped much? This blatantly requires you to be in same room with <em>two out of two</em> mush - a highly suspicious activity in itself.</p><p>So in a sense, Mush is aiming for gameplay it does not actually have; not a novel thing in the world of games, unfortunately, but a shame regardless because the concept is still very solid. And perhaps with more well thought out interactions with the ship and others, and more carefully balanced sides Mush could deliver on the suspense and paranoia in deep space - something that hooked me straight away. And if the Mush were not so doomed to lose at the very beginning, perhaps less people would instantly throw up arms and look for a next ship - one where they will hopefully be humans.</p>

                <p>The point is that the food test never was fixed, even after numerous complaints (I presume). So the method of escaping is based on good will. Before the mush appear on the ship, it needs to be pointed out that there is no game if the food test is run. But really all the mush have is hope that the human players are playing for fun, not for glory... And yeah I've played the game in French.</p>

                <p>I have played a few ships as the mush (not in this server, in case someone bothers to check).<br>We were quite proficient at our jobs, even in ships with acceptable levels of activity, thanks to a basic planning, and stealth, of course.</p><p>Supposing an ideal situation where you start at the first day (ships don't fill up quickly enough in my experience) you can quickly mass up on spores (before basic research comes out the pipe), and you and your fellow mush will put 2 down on a first target (small coordination goes a long way here).<br>By the next day that guy will be a mush (after one more poke), and if you picked your target right (knowledgeable/active guys are your picks of choice) you'll get 2 spores on a next subject in that day (even if basic research is out, you should have a surplus from day 1, and the new guy can makes spores of his own).</p><p>From there it's exponential, and with a tiny bit of your imagination to decide on objectives (hit their morale, oxygen or hull protection), the quick guide to mush infection should lead you to success.</p><p>Note: using food as a method of conversion works very well since they'll be online as they turn, which is the only moment to use anonymush (lvl 2 mush skill, good at letting them think there's still only 2 mush, and that they are inactive). Not sure if this is always the same, but i'd cook a wonderful 3 spore dish to get a conversion in day 1 in one swing.<br>To humans: always suspect the chef, and the botanist, and the people who bring foods from expeditions... just don't trust food at all. Starvation is a minor side effect, surely it won't kill you.</p><p>Disclaimer: If you are Paola, mush, and on a semi competent ship, not even the admins themselves can help your sorry existence. Hope your partner is 1337 mush lvl, and just dump your AP into the damn, soul sucking, comms terminal, and go play something else. Because everyone will notice if you are failing to do your thing (or just not putting in the AP you should, a.k.a all your AP), and in a competent ship chances are you won't even be allowed off the camera-ridden bridge to grab a bite (best excuse ever for everything and everyone...).</p><p>Closing: Most of this basic theory of mush, along with a bit of basic practice of mush. Figured it by myself, but i'd not claim it to be an achievement. Also, i think none of my top secret SECRET tactics are left exposed here after i went through it, but let me know if you find something that's extremely effective and SECRET, so that we can purge it from where prying human eyes might catch a glimpse of it.</p>

I could just be a dull bulb, [...]</cite><p>I'm not calling you a dull bulb, but you did miss my point entirely. You're right that the paranoia is solely on the side of the Humans. And the scenario I laid out was one in which the Mush are killed early due to inadvertently revealing themselves because of the poor documentation and tool-tips the Mush have available to them, and thus turning the game into a Humans vs. environment game with zero paranoia.</p><p>I don't see the analogy between ghouls in D2N and Mush in Mush. Ghouls can choose to play with the humans or play against them. Ghouls who play against the humans do need to try to cover their tracks, similar to The Mush, but that's about as far as the analogy goes. A (smart) non-ghoul griefer also needs to cover their tracks, and they don't have to be a ghoul to do so.</p>

                <p>There are plenty ways to prevent that, though. For example, the mush could instead of eating the second item, briefly 'hide' it in their bodies, before forcefully pushing it out after a set of time. This way the mush has time to find a proper nook to dump the second food item.</p><p>Another solution would be that eating would somehow damage mush. Belatedly would probably be best; for example, temporarily limiting their AP gain. So if they for example, eat all the pills, they would not be able to move afterwards for several cycles (and perhaps this can't move condition would be public, to discourage excessive food sabotage).</p><p>You could even make it so that eating takes more AP for mush.</p>

                <p>I just won a game as mush. I think the key to playing mush is political sabotage, not actual physical sabotage. Physical sabotage, like hiding/stealing/breaking things will get you busted very, very quickly by a decent team.</p><p>Political sabotage is much better. Play yourself as a useful member of the team. People actually got 100% proof of me being mush last game - got dirty with poor excuse, only surviving suspect, tons of evidence, was practically caught hiding fire extinguisher. But due to my high activity and role as the only living pilot on the ship, they were reluctant to kill me in case suspicions were wrong. I practically spored right out in the open and then ended the day lying in the dorms because I was so confident of not getting killed.</p><p>Play up crises. Make it look like the mush is not as bad as oxygen/morale/Hunters. More importantly, play up the least important crisis. When oxygen is at 10, get everyone shooting down Hunters. When Hunters are hitting the ship (especially Aracks), get everyone to dedicate their efforts to searching for a planet. If you do it right, you might even get someone left behind in a patrol ship.</p><p>Waste AP. Sabotage is easy to fix. Making people run around back and forth is more effective. My favorite is convincing people to dump AP on me... especially Janice. If you're an influential member of the crew (like Jin Su), you can boss active people into doing things like scanning for planets, using the turrets, searching for items, running into the engine room, or staying up "on call" away from the beds.</p><p>Also political sabotage is a hell lot of fun for everyone! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I'm pretty confused as a first time Mush.</p><p>One specific question before I begin: If I'm a Janice Mush, can I disguise my Sabotages by doing them at the end of a cycle and then immediately making a NERON announcement, using the same text that he would normally use when a piece of equipment normally broke? If so, is there somewhere I can find this text, or do I just need to copy it next time I see something break?</p><p>It's only my first time as Mush, and I sure am feeling limited by everything. <br>-I can't pick up almost anything to hide it because the room logs let everyone know what items I've picked up, and it's obvious if it disappears after being taken by me that it's my fault.<br>-Sabotaging seems nearly impossible and still risky even with the trick I'm wondering about above. <br>-I'm constantly forced to waste AP and hang out in the dorms so I don't look suspicious. <br>-My partner seems inactive or can only log once a day so far, I will have to see after I wake up. <br>-The camera is in the Medlab (and the dorms of course), and I doubt anyone will accept food I bring to them, so I can't spore anyone's food.<br>-I feel like spiking people is my only option but allowing the active crew to research for 3 days without interrupting them sounds like a bad idea. <br>-The only opening I've had so far was a griefer who wasn't Mush creating a ruckus, giving me an excuse to get dirty, extract spores, and spike someone. I don't even know how I would acceptably get dirty as Janice, eating food as an excuse will only work so many times. I don't think I should have to rely on griefers to get openings.</p>

Every day, the research team completes projects that devastate my abilities. They've finished Mycoalarms now and I have no idea where they could be, and I still need to spore my victim once more before I can get some help (Since the other Mush is practically inactive).</p><p>Also, this is my first game as Mush, I don't have access to Demoralize/Trapper/Transfer, or anything cool like that. I have Phagocyte, Traitor, and Fungal Kitchen, which isn't usable until later because everyone is refusing to eat rations until day 4, and many of the pills were eaten before Mush were assigned.</p><p>I'm planning on trying to get myself on some expeditions but it's not guaranteed the crew will nominate me for the expedition team. Also, I've saved a slot for Anonymush, which may come into effect if I manage to spore the same person again tomorrow, but again, there's no guarantee I will get the opportunity and honestly if this fails, I don't have much I can do left.</p><p>I'm not using this ship to just learn. I will learn a lot, indeed, but I am still here to win, I don't want to sit here and act perfect all the way until Eden or Sol, that's just boring and practically is the same as me being a human. So naturally, I would come and ask questions on a thread like this, so I can plan my moves out more carefully. Which you're currently helping me with.</p>

                <p>Oh, when I played mush first time, I once saw the message like "Ian munched his big meal". It was just eating in a room with others, but it was highlighted with red! And it was so like some "mush", and i did not know the word "to munch"! Good thing - I just posted it in general and people explained, that it was ok.</p>
