                <p>Let's say that, in a major plot twist, a very successful Daedalus crew has discovered that one of their most helpful and beloved crewmates was, in fact, the nefarious <em>Alpha Mush</em> all along. The other Mush lies defeated and the <em>Retro-Fungal Serum</em> is a definite possibility.</p><p>This last Alpha Mush is active during the reveal, and their AP and MP gauges are full. They see the situation unfold in front of them; some want to use the serum, others are pushing to kill the Mush before they can do anything. The Mush could go on a killing spree, kidnap vital items and hop into the Pasiphae, they could potentially even doom the crew for good... but it wouldn't really be all that fun.</p><p>So, how should the Mush react?</p><p>The ultimate objective of the Mush is to <em>halt the human mission at all costs</em>. Being cured would work against this objective, and thus 'against the team'. And yet, from an OOC point of view, it's usually more fun for everyone if they could just keep playing on the ship and, perhaps, even take it to Sol or Eden, without losing the Mush's expertise and vital skills.</p><p>So, it all boils down to this...</p><p><em>Are there situations in which the Mush may surrender</em>, beg for the Serum and their survival... or <em>MUST</em> they be antagonists to their last breath, perhaps even finishing in a suicide attack? Not harming the crew as much as possible with your last breath would be "playing against your team", but... between going to Eden and getting abandoned in the Pasiphae, I know what I'd prefer.</p><p>And if you may not surrender... then how DOES the Serum even get used? Any capable and active Mush will defend themselves to the teeth and, technically, should avoid the serum like the plague. But where's the fun in that?</p>

In fact, if you're on the edge of being caught, you played the long game, the cure's being worked on.... Ahem, it sounds like it's time, unless your humans lead you to believe they think they are mush free, or have 1 mush that isn't you.</p>

                <p>Mush may never surrender, nor are there <strong>any</strong> allowable circumstances in which they may volunteer for the serum. Begging for survival/surrendering is strictly sanctionable, and we take such cases very seriously, because while it grants a boon to the human team...it's also playing against the Mush team. It also effectively ruins the Mush hunt. If anyone on your ship is entertaining the notion of offering the serum to a remaining Mush, <strong>please</strong> do us all a favor and remind them of the rules. If a human player offers to cure a Mush if they out themselves, and the Mush complies even after being reminded of the rules, report them <strong>both</strong>.</p><p>I was on a ship where someone suggested that we offer to cure the remaining Mush, and said that if nobody reported it, the SDF wouldn't find out. I had to quickly put a stop to that line of reasoning, and a Mush was still cured, but <em>without</em> a surrender involved. I didn't want to see both players get a sanction.</p><p>That said, the serum may even be used on a <em>mutated</em> Mush, so if they're quick, they might stop you before you can kill anyone. But the Mush are expected to avoid being cured, however they can. Picking up the serum and using it on a human is one possible option, though you'll almost certainly be killed for it afterward. You can go out fighting; or take a few items, a ship, and play the "You'll never cure me!" game.</p><p>Of course, as Impet suggested, it's possible that you're already a suspect, and your options are limited. But it's also possible they don't have a suspect, and will be waiting for someone to present themselves as a target...in which case, waiting for the right moment to point the finger at someone else can also be a viable move. Doubt can lead to inaction, and stalling for time is a <em>very</em> valuable strategy here, because the longer you survive, the more desperate they might become.</p>

I wouldn't be expecting the mush to say yes but I can try. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But yeah, as people said before, you can cure a mush without them knowing about it. We did that on my last ship, the remaining mush was keeping a very low profile and was even part of a mush hunting group where we had another main suspect. Then she did a couple mistakes that made us suspect her, we had another chat where we talked about rushing the serum without them knowing and gamble in curing her and it worked out.</p>

As a human it is not playing against my team if I ask a mush if he wants to be cured. I wouldn't be expecting the mush to say yes but I can try. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></cite><p>It's an incitement to spoil the game. Granted, it's not you (as a human) playing against your team, but you are trying to get someone to play against theirs. Flip the situation: If there are more Mush than humans, and Panic sets in, a Mush openly offering to convert a human would be trying to get them to surrender, and play against the human team. The fact that there is only ever a single dose of the serum is irrelevant; it's the incitement to spoil the game that's the issue here.</p><p>It's not <em>wrong</em> to discuss the idea in a joking manner, per se, as long as it remains just a joke, or as a way to taunt/threaten the Mush. ("We're going to find you, and we're going to cure you!" - that sort of thing.) But it shouldn't <strong>ever</strong> be put forward as a serious plan, as it was on my ship. And it <em>was</em> explicitly suggested that if nobody reported it, then the SDF wouldn't find out... I actually outed myself as a mod in order to make sure that nobody would follow through with it. And as I said, we found our Mush through investigation, and cured him...but not before he'd created a beta Mush, and the Beta had to be killed.</p><p>Besides, it wouldn't exactly be fair to first offer to cure them, and then to report them for surrendering if they came forward. Would they have surrendered if the offer had not been made? Probably not. So why should only the surrendering Mush take the fall for that, but the one who offered the surrender in the first place not risk a sanction?</p>

                <p>Well, as a human I'd be happy to corner the last mush and have him agree to be cured. I think it's a beautiful ending.<br>And again. If a serum exists, it means it's up to the players to choose if they want to use it or not. It's a very hard thing to research, anyway. So no way it can be considered ruining a game.

                <p>I don't like playing human. But I don't stand outside the cameras, making myself an easy target. It ruins the game for others, because a lot of people play the game for the mush hunt (without griefers and surrenders). It's not a plot twist to surrender. It's just refusing to play the cards you've been dealt.</p><p>If you really, really want the humans to win, then cooperate. Do your character's job. Go in for a mush Sol win. Don't ruin the game for someone else. A sleeper mush who never spores provides a significant amount of mush hunting. Convince people to research the serum for the Sol return and if they find you out, they'll just cure you.</p>

I don't choose to become one, I have a conscious mind and I can be a traitor to my race, secretly wishing for humans to win and to become a human myself. I play along for a while, but when it becomes obvious the mush are doomed and when the opportunity arises I steal the Serum and inject myself or ask to be injected. Why the hell not? The game lets you do it, so it's possible and not prohibited in any way. And it's one of the multiple cool plot twists that we love this game for.</cite><p>No, you CAN'T inject yourself with the serum. It's physically impossible. Even if you pick it up, you can only ever inject <em>someone else</em> with it...because <strong>suicide and surrender are sanctionable offenses</strong>. That's why the hell not. You play the hand your dealt, and you don't get to ruin the game for everyone else because you got chosen (or converted) as Mush. Whether or not you like playing as Mush is irrelevant.</p><p>The human team deserves an opponent who isn't going to just give up just because things are looking bad. By the same token, being Mush is no challenge when over half the human team gives up on the game, and the other half are barely coordinating.</p><p>And again: <strong>Mush are not allowed to agree to be cured, just like humans are not allowed to agree to be converted.</strong> This constitutes a surrender, is considered playing against one's team, and spoils the game. <strong>Do not do this.</strong> People who are involved in these actions may be sanctioned.</p>

                <p>We had a game a while back where the two Alphas were Jin Su and Paola. Jin Su spored in front of Eleesha, and as a result he posted a screenshot of his own game, revealing the Mush channel and outting Paola. (Jin Su then deleted the picture on his end, and bragged about how he wouldn't be sanctioned because "It's illegal in france" or some such nonsense. I would REALLY like to know if he got suspended for that...) He then took off in a patrol ship and we abandoned him (again, he laughed about this, along the lines of "Now I get to get into a good game sooner" or something)</p><p>Now at this point, with the pvp element totally ruined, no one was sure what to do with Paola. Paola, for her part, was willing to cooperate in exchange for not being killed- Now. Was this playing against the Mush team? She'd have to be immensely careful, but if she played her cards right, she could have still infected others, undermined our progress... Just going off and rampaging or something wasn't going to help the goals of the Mush in the slightest. The humans, on the other hand, were willing to let her live under a watchful eye because she was an extremely useful crew member. Again, was allowing her to live under armed guard really playing against the human team?</p><p>Incidently in the end it didn't matter a squit, Chao killed Paola against the wishes of the majority, and then Chao was murdered in retaliation. (Personally, I theorized that Paola may have transferred into Chao- she had bought a gold project, so I found it entirely likely that she was a Gold Mode player and might have access to it. Would have been a very clever play and a way out of such a crappy situation, but it wasn't the case in the slightest. Whoops. (That was a weird ship.))</p>

A few times on half-inactive ships I got highest glory, and even went back to Sol.</p><p>But I agree wholly with you. Some don't like playing mush, but it's a TEAM game... not a "I play whatever I like to play and if I don't like it I ruin the game for the other people". If you don't like playing mush, then don't. Play your role... if you are mush Finola, do research; mush Kuan Ti, do projects. Mush Chao/Eleesha... pretend to hunt mush, and if your mush partner gets discovered, well... you might have to do it in order to cover yourself.</p><p>But DO NOT go all the way to suicide in the open just because you don't like play as mush, otherwise you ruin the game not only for your partner, but for all humans (the hunt of a sneaky mush is a very thrilling part of the game).</p><p>And if you do, well... deal with being reported. At least you got out of being mush, despite being sanctioned for being a selfish and inconsiderate player.</p>

Fine, it probably means that you will not be very skilled either, which in consequence means that you will probably be killed before day 5. Usually only skilled MUSH get to survive until the serum is discovered and if you did so... Might as well continue trying to win, don't you think?</p><p>Besides, as other people said, play the hand you were dealt. SOMEONE has to be the villain, otherwise there is no challenge. Sure, it might be a bit sad when you're selected as alpha but remember: The crew deserves that you give yourself 100% to your role, just as if your role was to be human! They deserve to be challenged and to win because they're good, not because the MUSH surrendered. A game with good MUSH players is an impredictable novelty, a game with a surrender is a routine "xdays return to sol/eden".</p><p>And as a last point: Statistically speaking, you're only Alpha one every 8 games. Enjoy it/suffer through it whenever it happens, you won't get that chance in a while...</p>

                <p>The rules are not to be made up by players as they go, and ignored as they see fit. The SDF exists to make sure the game is fair for everyone, both humans and Mush. That's why Mush can't inject themselves with the serum, and the hacker kit can't be taken out in a patrol ship.</p><p>I didn't say that negotiation and deceit (in order to stall for time) was against the rules, per se. I only said it was risky. People have been sanctioned for RP that went too far, and got them reported, and this is a similar sort of thing... As long as you don't appear to be playing against your team. and don't appear to be cured <em>willingly</em>, then it's unlikely to be seen as a surrender.</p><p>But we've also seen one Mush sell out another, in the hopes of being cured. You have two Alphas and a Beta, and after one is killed and the serum researched, one Mush gives up the other, offering to work with the humans in exchange for the cure. This is one of the main reasons Mush are forbidden from asking to be cured.</p>

I don't mean that as an attack or troll or such, I mean it as genuine food for thought.</p><p>Mush have victories too, perhaps you need to find a different mush playstyle, for example going super-stealth and getting back to Sol as a secret mush all along, if you're one of the most help, contributing active people on the ship, people will support you and not think you're the mush.</p><p>If you're mush and you play against mush, you're ruining it for your companion, he may very well enjoy being evil.</p>

Just...NO.</strong> Don't do that either...intentional inactivity is sanctionable, too, and I have no hesitation in saying that if you have a history of giving up whenever you become Mush, there is a good chance you will not be playing on <strong>any</strong> ships for much longer. People who habitually ruin the game for others will get longer quarantines.</p><p>You have to play the game to its natural conclusion, so going inactive just because you become Mush is effectively the same as surrendering. And it <strong>STILL</strong> ruins the game for the human team, not to mention your Mush partner. <strong>They deserve a challenging opponent</strong>. If that's <strong>you</strong>, then play the role you're dealt, and don't screw the ship over, just because you don't want to play as a Mush. You don't have to <em>like</em> being a Mush. Hell, you don't even have to be that <em>good</em> at playing the role. Most people aren't. But it's a role that <strong>must be played</strong>.</p><p>What do you call people who refuse to play for their team, and consequently ruin the game for the other players? Griefers, right?</p><p>What you're suggesting here is that it should be <em>acceptable behavior</em>, both socially and in game terms, to:</p><p>Join a PvP game with a very limited number of players per instance, and have teams get auto-assigned. Then, if people don't like the team they're on, then can just stop playing for the better part of a week, and the game will still be interesting for those who are still actively playing. It's <em>not</em> logical to suggest that this behavior should be acceptable.</p><p>How fun is it for <em>you</em> if the other team just gives up, without offering any resistance? And how is that <em>even remotely</em> different than what you're saying you'd do here?</p>

                <p>One acceptable 'I won't be mush' strategy is to always play Chun. No one will ever fault you for that in any way.</p><p>Otherwise, there's a bunch of ways to play as mush that are fully allowed within the rules... <em>Kreton</em>, are you 100% against using <strong>any</strong> of these strategies, however modified, ever?</p><p>Some likely to be brief, effective, legal ways to play Mush as various characters:</p><p>Any but Ian: Kill humans. With or without weapons, in a room of your choosing. With or without wearing armor yourself if you can get it, with or without the medkit.</p><p>Take demoralize - unlike attacking, demoralize cannot miss. 2 AP = 2 morale loss, no saving throw. Even a gold with connection to sol and a cycle beside Janice (though better yet use on Janice) is going down with 12 AP put into this skill. Use close to cycle change to ensure death, use shortly after cycle change to ensure maximal disruption and intense focus for several game days attempting to keep that person's morale up, assuming that person gets saved. Consider discussing with your partner what they want to do about it, there may be some doing it going on early to cope....</p><p>Any Tech: Dismantling both showers is just intense. Combine with killing and/or transfer for the most damage possible.</p><p>As Ian (or after transferring into Ian): Ian is a pain to kill. Grab armor or take hard boiled, do something obvious and disruptive (Maybe grab sample and apron, keep being able to make 4 spores a day for 2 AP each, thank you very much!), and park yourself in the medlab. Log in often, save your AP for heals and/or making spores, phagocyte if needed. The crew <strong>will</strong> be trying to kill you, but they may need an elusive kill strike to do so. It can be quite exciting to be so hunted, and your mush partner is hopefully using the chaos and confusion most fruitfully as well.</p>

                <p>Anyone who finds playing Mush intolerable is simply lacking in imagination. Playing mush breaks up the usual step by step progression that they're used to. They're to be pitied.</p><p>I just finished a ship as Chao where I repressed all my bloodlust in the cause of humanity and hunting the Mush without harming my teammates. Then Mamma Frieda was very tricksy and clever and managed to free me from my humanity. I was the cause, directly or indirectly of 5 or 6 humans before my reign of terror was over. What fun the whole thing was and the humans had a blast, I've rarely seen such activity on the boards as there was while they were trying to hunt me down. They were totally freaked out that the Chao they had come to depend on and even trust was suddenly such a monster.</p>

                <p>While it's certainly true that the Mush are to be fought, I think you're going about this the wrong way; and that mindset is leading you to miss out on an opportunity to become better as a human player. As I said, you don't have to <em>like</em> being Mush; but when you <em>are</em> one, you have to play the role. That's the whole point of the "Role" in Role Playing Games, isn't it?</p><p>There's also something to be said for making the most of the experience when you become Mush...because the more you understand the various ways Mush characters can be played, the better equipped you are to trust your instincts when one is lying about their activities, or taking intentionally wasteful actions. To understand your enemy's thought process makes you better prepared to fight them. Turn that experience as the antagonist into something that makes your human gameplay better!</p>

                <p>Yeah i really want to be mush, Spazticus do you have some option in the SDF to make me 100% mush next game? Anyways what Spazticus said has helped me a lot in games like CK2, EU4 and other strategy games, it has also helped me in CCG's with the hero feature by playing different heros.</p>

As I understand it. it's not against the rules to voluntarily become Mush while you're in a casting (and "friendly" Mush are also permitted in castings.) Then again, Castings don't count for leaderboards and such the same way that regular games do, so it's okay for the rules to apply a bit differently there.</p>

I should also note that volunteering to become Mush was <strong>a means to an end</strong> in some of the Castings of which I am aware, and the Mush were friendly.</p>

Of course, if it would disable the switch after you join the ship, that could work.</p><p>I think it's just too troublesome. If you don't like playing mush... well, it's a <strong>ROLE</strong>PLAYING GAME... you play "roles".

As mush you don't have to go out in a killing spree.. at least not right from the start. choose the sneaky playing style and try to get an infected return to sol, you wouldn't harm the humans much, but you can still technically win...</p>

                <p>I'm not against it, but it's kinda boring to ALWAYS play human. It's really predictable and after a while you have very much like a routine needed to reach Sol/Eden.</p><p>It's actually the MUSH that gives that special thrill on the ships that makes the game so exciting. I, for one, love playing mush... some characters more than others. Of course, I would use that option you speak of, since I haven't tried some characters fully because when I did I got picked as mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But I don't understand people that NEVER want to play as mush, because I think they are missing about half of the game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"></p>

You infected Sol/Eden without serum? BIG WIN! You disturbed the Humans so much die all died after you got killed? Still a win!<br>As a Mush you don't really play to SURVIVE, you play so as many Humans as possible die or get turned! Do as much damage as possible to the Human plans. The Humans want to go to Sol/Eden without Mush onboard and if possible with the cure researched, so if you get to Sol/Eden without them knowing you are Mush you still win (even if you never killed anyone), but that is kinda boring don't you think? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>
