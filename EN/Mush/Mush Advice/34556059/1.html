                <p>In this thread I want to ask You- all players experienced in playing as Stephen, or even players which know something what is good to know about him when playing as him... Yeah, simply- how to play him? What should I do as a Stephen Seagull? Is it good to stay in monitored room and if somebody will need it- go to refectory, cook ration and bring that person the food? Maybe make a coffee for researchers? Please, if anybody can help...</p>

                <p>Early on, consider yourself a generalist. This advice applies to any generalist -</p><p>Research is generally the most important early generalist role - trade off on research resets; cooperate with those deciding what's most important to research first. You may not get great advances yourself, but you can reset those with the skills to be great researchers so they get great gains.</p><p>Try to keep a small to medium surplus of AP to handle emergencies. Some mush like to berzerk early in play - if so, someone needs the AP to try and do something about it. Fires, broken O2 tanks, all sorts of stuff can happen that needs someone with a few AP to find and fix - you can be that someone and save the ship!</p><p>Pay attention to if the Connection to Sol needs to be made - attempting to (re)contact sol is a great use for a generalist's AP (Be sure that all 16 players are aboard the ship before attempting to make that connection though).</p><p>If your ship has research that's flying along - consider focusing instead on relaying Nexus Projects, or in keeping track of equipment that needs to be moved around (ropes, weapons, compass, spacesuits to Icarus Bay; hydropots to the lab along with the other plants; for examples) and getting it to where it needs to go.</p><p>Later, once the Mush have been found, your shipmates -may- want to trust you to cook them food. That's no gaurentee though - and a cook has great access to making infectious meals and having some control over which player eats those prepared meals - control over who gets the spores can be vital in gaurenteeing people get converted (6 spores given to 6 different people has a very different affect on gameplay than 2 people getting 3 spores each!).</p><p>Your cooking skill will find great use once Expos start to happen - you can tell what the alien fruit does; you can use your free cooking points to freeze alien steaks which removes any bad effects and turns them into normal uncooked rations; if a cooked ration seems suspicious (say someone brings food for someone else - hrm, they could be a mush!) you can use your free cooking points to freeze that meal, turning it back into an uncooked ration and killing any spores it may have contained.</p>
