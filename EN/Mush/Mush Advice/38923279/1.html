                <p>(I'm assuming bronze player for this)<br>Best bests: ones with a useful first or second level skill that have simple jobs,<br>- Hua: Pilot (Save up AP to blow all at once shooting down hunters or collecting scrap)<br>- Janice: Shrink is an amazingly helpful skill that can make or break a ship. All you have to do is stay in the dorms at cycle change so people can restore lost morale. Be careful, you're a prime mush target! Trust no one.<br>- Ian: Botany is very useful, as it is one of the few ways Janice herself can restore morale (bananas are amazing fruits!) Nobody will suffer for you having it, though there are other ways to play Ian.<br>-Kuan Ti: Though later skills of his are better, the Designer skill means you get free points to spend on Neron projects. You'll probably end up coordinating project research, so if you can't handle that, choose another role.<br>-Paola: As the Comms manager, you're expected to be pulling from Xyloph, updating Neron, and decoding rebel signals. It's an AP intensive job, but a fairly easy one, especially since you usually get the Swedish Sofa to yourself. If you can, take Logistics Expert instead of Radio expert: it lets Frieda save the AP she'd spend walking back and forth between the bridge and the dorm.<br>-Stephen or Gioele: Generalist that fill in the gaps on any ship. Solid (G) allows you to move people out of a room when necessary, and Cook (S) means you can tell the crew exactly what that strange alien plant will do to you when eaten. It also means that you can cook things for free, even if nobody will trust gifted food until after the mush are dead.</p><p>Okay: First or second level skills, but require familiarity with the game for most effective play<br>-Chun: If you take anything other than Mankind's Only Hope, prepare to be slaughtered. This skill halves the daily morale loss of the crew, and if you're a bronze Chun it is the only think you should ever take. However, you also are the hub of the Mush hunt, as the only confirmed human. You have to know how things work and be willing and able to coordinate a bunch of panicked humans without spilling the beans to the Mush.<br>-Terrence: Technician (his second level skill) is an essential one to have on the ship, and you get it at the earliest level. However, Terrence's movement points are precious, and it takes some coordination to have you working at your best.<br>-Frieda: Astrologist is her first and best skill, but it means saving lost of AP and spending it all at once analyzing a planet. Good management of AP is important, as is knowing when to trash a planet and not waste more AP on it.<br>-Jin Su: His first skill, Leader, is the one that a bronze player should be taking - you can give speeches that will lift the spirits of your crew (literally!) However, as the commander of the ship, you have big responsibilities. You have to be able to command and organize the crew, and MUST check in often because you are the only one that can (legitimately) access the ship controls. This also means you need to go on all the expeditions while there are Mush, since nobody will want to be left behind.<br>-Raluca: Responsible for PILGRED repairs. She is an easy Mush target and has to play with slow AP gain, since sleeping in a dorm with other people will literally kill her within a few days.<br>-Derek: As Chao's replacement, you're the muscle of the mush hunt. You need to be able to act when a mush is exposed, so wise AP management is essential.</p><p>Avoid: Involve experienced play or high level skills<br>-Roland: Do NOT take Roland unless you have unlocked Pilot. A Roland with Sprinter as his only skill is nearly useless to the crew. Admittedly, it's his second skill, but it can seriously hamper the ship!<br>-Andie: Andie's first skill, Pilot, IS useful, but Andie is supposed to replace Finola as head of the Research team. Unless the rest of your crew has that covered, you really need to be taking his/her third skill, Polyadvent.<br>-Eleesha: Requires a deep understanding of the game, since your Tracker skill makes you responsible for hunting down suspicious activities and exposing the mush.</p><p>I think that about covers everything. It took me far too long to type. XD</p>

                <p>Depends on a lot of factors, such as what you want to do and all that. I'm going to assume you're bronze. Make sure before you chose a character that you level them up in the <em>My Account</em> ( <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/me" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/me</a> ) section so you can chose the skill you want when you get on a ship. I can't recommend one character in particular, but I can give a brief overview of each one, and it's all in my opinion, others may disagree.</p><p><em><strong>Andie</strong></em> - If you've got the EXP to level him up to 3 (55), then take <em>Polyvalent</em>. Not a great choice as a newer player, as you'll have to manage your AP closely, but gives you a good introduction to researching and lets you join expeditions.</p><p><em><strong>Derek</strong></em> - Not really sure what he does, but you can chose him and help out where needed. If the crew is good at giving directions you'll have the opportunity to get involved in multiple things and learn a bit more game mechanics, be it research, PILGRED, killing, NERON, etc. Pretty good choice as a new player.</p><p><em><strong>Eleesha</strong></em> - <em>Tracker</em> is the best choice, but she's a poor character for new players. You are the lead investigator, and typically you have to understand much strategies to be effective and know what to look for, something more experienced players have a huge advantage in.</p><p><em><strong>Frieda</strong></em> - <em>Astrophysicist</em> is a must. Simple role and easy to figure out. Just stick to the lab and scan planets when your AP is full. Pretty easy to figure out, and doesn't require a huge amount of activity, but can be a pretty boring role as well. Still, it allows you to keep an eye on what the more experienced players do.</p><p><em><strong>Gioele</strong></em> - <em>Paranoid</em> or <em>Caffiene Junky</em> both have their merits. Regardless of what you choose, you are a generalist, and can help where needed. Similar to Derek, as you can go all over the ship, don't have a big responsibility, and can help where needed.</p><p><em><strong>Ian</strong></em> - <em>Botanist</em> is a must. Not a great choice, as you have to take care of the plants every cycle 8, and gardening takes a bit to learn, but gives you a well-defined role on the ship.</p><p><em><strong>Janice</strong></em> - <em>Shrink</em> all the way, but a really poor choice as a newer player as you are the one to manage morale, not to mention you are the default NERON Admin. A pretty big responsibility.</p><p><em><strong>Hua</strong></em> - <em>Pilot</em> is the clear choice here. Gives you a good overview of Piloting, and gives you a chance to go on expeditions. A pretty good choice, as all you really have to do is kill hunters and collect scrap. Just have to be active enough to go out when needed.</p><p><em><strong>Jin Su</strong></em> - Many good skills, and a great choice outside of bronze, but a horrible choice as a new player. Huge responsibility coupled with a lot of valuable skills means you should leave this guy for silver/gold players that are also experienced. Still, if you are very active, may be a good choice since many Jin Su's are griefers or inactive, and an active yet inexperienced Jin Su would be a major improvement.</p><p><em><strong>Kuan Ti</strong></em> - <em>Technician</em> is better, but I doubt you have the XP for that, so go with <em>Designer</em>. You spend all your time working in the Nexus doing NERON Projects. A well-defined role that is pretty easy to pick up, so a pretty good choice as a new player.</p><p><em><strong>Paola</strong></em> - <em>Logistics Expert</em> is better for the crew, but <em>Radio Expert</em> is useful as well, and makes your job easier. Still, not a good choice as a new player as you are the default Comms Officer, and you have a huge responsibility. It's also a bit confusing to learn.</p><p><em><strong>Raluca</strong></em> - <em>Technician</em> is better as bronze that <em>Physicist</em>, but the second choice is still decent. Kind of a boring role to play however, as you don't get to gain much AP too fast and you're kept at the rear of the ship, doing nothing but the occasional NERON Project relay.</p><p><em><strong>Roland</strong></em> - <em>Pilot</em> is essential. He's basically the same as Hua for a new player, but with fewer other useful skills, so if you want to go piloting, he's a better choice.</p><p><em><strong>Stephen</strong></em> - <em>Apprentice</em> is best, but since you're on your second game there is almost no way you've got the XP for that, so he's just another generalist like Gioele. Another option if you want to move around where needed.</p><p><em><strong>Terrence</strong></em> - All of his first three skills are useful, but you'll probably not have enough XP for <em>Technician</em> and there's usually no other <em>Robotics Expert</em>. Not a great role as a new person, as it requires managing your MP pretty closely.</p><p><em><strong>Chun</strong></em> - <em>Mankind's Only Hope</em> if you don't want the rest of the crew to kill you for incompetence. You're guaranteed not to be <em>mush</em> this way, but you're also essentially required to stay near the lab. You're also the only one everybody can trust to be human, so a bit of responsibility there as well in hunting mush. Ok choice, but not great for a new player.</p><br><p>Hope this was a bit helpful! Sorry for the wall of text, it's hard to gauge what a person would enjoy most on the ship.</p>

All you have to do is stay in the dorms at cycle change so people can restore lost morale. Be careful, you're a prime mush target! Trust no one.<br>- Ian: Botany is very useful, as it is one of the few ways Janice herself can restore morale (bananas are amazing fruits!) Nobody will suffer for you having it, though there are other ways to play Ian.<br>-Kuan Ti: Though later skills of his are better, the Designer skill means you get free points to spend on Neron projects. You'll probably end up coordinating project research, so if you can't handle that, choose another role.<br>-Paola: As the Comms manager, you're expected to be pulling from Xyloph, updating Neron, and decoding rebel signals. It's an AP intensive job, but a fairly easy one, especially since you usually get the Swedish Sofa to yourself. If you can, take Logistics Expert instead of Radio expert: it lets Frieda save the AP she'd spend walking back and forth between the bridge and the dorm.<br>-Stephen or Gioele: Generalist that fill in the gaps on any ship. Solid (G) allows you to move people out of a room when necessary, and Cook (S) means you can tell the crew exactly what that strange alien plant will do to you when eaten. It also means that you can cook things for free, even if nobody will trust gifted food until after the mush are dead.</p><p>Okay: First or second level skills, but require familiarity with the game for most effective play<br>-Chun: If you take anything other than Mankind's Only Hope, prepare to be slaughtered. This skill halves the daily morale loss of the crew, and if you're a bronze Chun it is the only think you should ever take. However, you also are the hub of the Mush hunt, as the only confirmed human. You have to know how things work and be willing and able to coordinate a bunch of panicked humans without spilling the beans to the Mush.<br>-Terrence: Technician (his second level skill) is an essential one to have on the ship, and you get it at the earliest level. However, Terrence's movement points are precious, and it takes some coordination to have you working at your best.<br>-Frieda: Astrologist is her first and best skill, but it means saving lost of AP and spending it all at once analyzing a planet. Good management of AP is important, as is knowing when to trash a planet and not waste more AP on it.<br>-Jin Su: His first skill, Leader, is the one that a bronze player should be taking - you can give speeches that will lift the spirits of your crew (literally!) However, as the commander of the ship, you have big responsibilities. You have to be able to command and organize the crew, and MUST check in often because you are the only one that can (legitimately) access the ship controls. This also means you need to go on all the expeditions while there are Mush, since nobody will want to be left behind.<br>-Raluca: Responsible for PILGRED repairs. She is an easy Mush target and has to play with slow AP gain, since sleeping in a dorm with other people will literally kill her within a few days.<br>-Derek: As Chao's replacement, you're the muscle of the mush hunt. You need to be able to act when a mush is exposed, so wise AP management is essential.</p><p>Avoid: Involve experienced play or high level skills<br>-Roland: Do NOT take Roland unless you have unlocked Pilot. A Roland with Sprinter as his only skill is nearly useless to the crew. Admittedly, it's his second skill, but it can seriously hamper the ship!<br>-Andie: Andie's first skill, Pilot, IS useful, but Andie is supposed to replace Finola as head of the Research team. Unless the rest of your crew has that covered, you really need to be taking his/her third skill, Polyadvent.<br>-Eleesha: Requires a deep understanding of the game, since your Tracker skill makes you responsible for hunting down suspicious activities and exposing the mush.</p><p>I think that about covers everything. It took me far too long to type. XD</p></cite><p>Jin is kinda avoid for everyone that cant be active very often, if you play once a day you wont live long if you pick Jin. Roland is at the okay level as it isnt hard to lvl him to 2. And i would say Derek, Gio and Stephen go to okay. Just because they have no jobs doesnt mean they are easy to play necesarly, your ship will depend on you to be there when youre needed, and newbies may not figure out what to do if noone says what to do, specialists are easier to play because they just have job they have to do, and you dont have to think about what to do with full AP, most specialists are easy like that anyways, Jin and Paola may not be</p><p>I would also say Ian would be your best choice</p>

                <p>I should add that in addition to assuming a Bronze player, I am also assuming somebody who is familiar with the Wiki - the types of things they might encounter, just not how they show up in live play. If you wouldn't consider yourself very "fluent" in Mush, choose a character with simple duties and not a lot of responsibility. Ian is great, as are Hua and Frieda - their roles are well defined and easy to carry out.</p><p>No matter what you end up choosing, try to be active and polite. Even if you are useless, the crew are more likely to forgive you and guide you if are obviously doing your best. Most ships have at least one more experienced player who will be willing to give tips, so don't hesitate to ask for help!</p><p>Good luck!</p>

                <p>One of the early tips recommended Ian, partially because "You only need to log in once a day".... I wanted to talk about that.</p><p>You get what you give this game, what the team collectively gives it. While Ian -can- just tend plants... that's arguably terribly boring and a terrible waste. Every character losely fits into one of two categories: Specialists and Generalists.</p><p>Specialists have a job that no one else, or very few else, can do at all or can do very well. Examples of specialists include Paola (or if she is dead or inactive, the player that inherits Comm offciser) because no one else can handle the Comm terminal, which is extremely important for the first... 8 days of play or so; Pilots, especially if they also have shooter skill (no one else can efficiently kill hunters without a lot of special projects, research, blueprints built and artifacts found), Techs and physists (all other characters get 1% increase in Pilgred repairs for 2 AP, Tech or physists get at least 5% for that cost). During research or project rushes, certain characters with the appropriate skills are temporary specialists, and during times of specific ship needs, any skill could become a specialized skill, at least for the duration of the critical need.</p><p>Everyone else, even Specialists who do not currently have a job to do, is a generalist. And generalists do -everything-, whatever is needed.</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Generalists are essential. These are the people who do most of:<br><br>resetting for projects, research, and Pilgred, so the specialists can keep getting their giant gain<br>firing turrets if it ever has to be done<br>fixing broken equipment when that needs to happen<br>fighting the fires<br>watering the plants and curing their diseases<br>keeping the ship connected to Sol once the ship is full<br>building needed blueprints<br>moving items around the ship<br>repairing the hull<br>opening space capsules<br>doing most of the killing of mush and any griefers<br>reading skill books to become specialists or add other useful skills<br>flat out doing 70% or more of the work that helps keep a ship alive and successful.</span></span></p><p>And Generalists are usually the ones who go without beds and with little food, to ensure that the specialists get the most AP possible to do their bursts of work as efficiently as possible. This ship couldn't run well without generalists. What a generalist may do can change every day, so stay aware, find out what your ship needs the most, and make it happen.</p><p>But that cannot happen if you're not really active in the game, if you don't really engage your teammates and involve yourself in the game and the specific goings-on of your own ship.</p><p>Talk to your ship. Let them guide you and help you learn. Many, many players are very good at teamwork. That's what this game is about.</p>

                <p>Moving Drones around! That is an important, often underrated task.</p><p>In any case yes, Ian is quite a nice mixture of both actually. He has a specific job, but as long as the garden is not huge (in which case he is the man) you have enough AP left over to do stuff that needs doing, rather than being forced to hope on others in favour of conserving AP for your specialty.</p><p>Also, being mostly safe from sudden death by Mush, especially if you are being active and helpful (i.e. a prime target), does have its advantages. Not to mention the tactical application of your trait to protect critical crew members (e.g. the last pilot) from the same.</p><p>That being said, with Finola gone, Ian ist most useful as a Biologist specializing in research these days.</p>
