                <p>As for me - asking for a test is good in two situations:<br>1) If the person already did stuff that could be because he is unskilled human or mush. Examples: passing Raluca room or medlab, showering without reporting it, even passing shower dorm for no reason (one time could be ok, but not if it happens regulary), a lot of his ap was not used on useful stuff.<br>Then I'll give a person all those reasons and say - as you see, you are either new player, or mush pretend to be new. We will kill you if you refuse, not to take risk - as you see here are enough reasons.<br>2) To make mush panic. If you are sure all weapons are secured and he used his ap - ask for a test, say about team is 95% sure he is a mush (but don't name reasons) and is going to kill him. It's just you, who is so kind to give him last chance to prove them wrong.</p><p>Details about asking for a test:<br>- Add the person to privite chat and check his status. If he logs in, but is trying to look like afk - kill<br>- Make sure that this person is unable to do much damage with any kind of rampage at the moment. Still mushes can rampage any time - forcing them to is not that big deal.<br>- Don't leave the person any kind of excuse about "test ruining the game"/"you cannot force me to do it" - present the situation like test is just his last chance, and if there were no tests in the game, you would have killed him already</p><p>Human who refuses the test in situation 1 (or at least suggest strong reasons he is a human - like "yes, I made a mistake passing med, but I used 6 ap on research, and 6 ap on plants - see, I had quite no way to spike there anyone" ) is just playing against him team - first making himself a suspect, then do nothing to prove reasons given wrong.</p>

                <p>I don't take mush tests even when I'm human so I agree with Impet (it really does destroy the mush hunt), although chances are if someones asking you for a food test and you're already mush - they probably want to kill you and are offering you a way out. In this case there is not many excuses, you either need to spend a few days in alpha dorm helping the ship / relaying research or figure your cover is blown and make 'em regret depending on a bug.</p><p>When i mush hunt, I don't give the mush a way out. As soon as i'm 80-90% sure they're mush , I start a private chat and we murder the heck out of that person before they can react. It works most of the time, although sometimes i just end up murdering noobs that don't help the ship,</p>

                <p>If someone randomly picks you for a 'test or die' situation, then you're a random kill if they kill you for that reason alone. Refusal to take a food test is not acceptable evidence that you are mush to SDF judgment. I recommend not being a jerk about it if someone challenges you to take one or else, but letting them know it's against the rules to kill you because you refuse <em>if that is the only evidence against you, or if there is otherwise weak evidence that you are mush</em> is totally appropriate, heck, link to this post in your ship's chat or the PM if you want.</p><p>it's only acceptable to 'force' mush testing when you already have enough evidence that they are mush that you don't 'need' to test, that a kill of them without the test is not going to get you sanctioned if you were reported for 'randomly killing' that person. People have been sanctioned for trying to forcibly test others without reasonable evidence. Exactly what reasonable evidence is, that is a judgment call, so I cannot give you blanket 'fits every case' rules. However, forcible mush testing is rarely a 'safe' choice to avoid sanction.</p><p>Never try to die though. Remember your human team has many humans on it, and even if a few of them are trying to force testing, report them and keep playing to win. Talk it out, but remember your team needs you, and its a waste of your team's resources to kill you. Don't encourage them to do that, don't try to get killed (suicide is sanctionable).</p>

                <p>One tactic to buy yourself some time, if you are a mush being forced to test though, try to identify the primary accuser, usually also the person most likely to kill you themselves, and try to cast doubt on their own humanity. If they've previously food tested themselves, they "could have" been converted since then if it's been a while. Obviously a human who's publicly proven themselves would be an excellent target for conversion so they could go around throwing accusations. [blatant lie]After all, you've been on ships where the mush hunter was actually a mush themselves leading a lynch mob; you've had this exact experience before so it's very plausible it's happening again.[/blatant lie] <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But ultimately, if someone is asking you to test or die and you are a mush, do everything you can to prepare for the incoming pitch forks, if you have the ability to Transfer, prepare to do so, or if you have phagocyte then at least try to take down your nearest best target who's low on health and/or not wearing armor. Obviously, the person asking you to test or die doesn't believe in limiting mush tests, so saying that you're against it on principle won't necessarily protect you.</p><p>Personally, I'm against Test Or Die because of this exact reason, it does nothing except buy the suspect some time. If I'm a human, I would rather risk killing a fellow human than give a suspected mush some warning, and (obviously I wouldn't want to kill anyone without enough evidence).</p>

It won't save you that ship, but just like dealing with a griefer, report them and let the SDF sort it out. We can help a rule breaker understand the rule, understand how to try and get what they want inside of the rules (without breaking the rules), and if the person continues to break rules anyway, we can help them decide to not play for a while.</p><p>If the person trying to get you to test is doing a legal forced test, then 'saving you' is a moot point if you actually are mush. The person could outright kill you (and probably would be wiser to have done so outright) at that point, and will soon kill you unless you give them great reason not to do so.</p><p>Personally, I think forcibly converting them is a great reason to offer them to not try to test you further or to kill you either, but I'm just snarky like that! <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>
