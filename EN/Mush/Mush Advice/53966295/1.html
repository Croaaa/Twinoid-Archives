                <p>Dude, Using the knife may result in an insta - death. And I also think torturing shoudl be used wisely. Just to confirm something whiche seemed mushy and not to randomly torture everyone until eventually getting lucky.</p><p>I can remember a game where I was mush and someone seems to have seen me flashing while showering.<br>To make sure Chao wanted to torture me, but I was staying in Icarus bay because of expedition with Ian around. Since he was too impatient to wait for Ian to leave room or so, he used blaster first, in intention to lower my health before torturing. I was killed One-shot xD<br>well, I was mush there, but it could have been different.</p><p>Sometimes bad gameplay is that harmful, that it can cost innocent lifes.<br>I guess using weapons to lower health may even be indeed reportable (probably especially when something bad happened in the end. If nothing happened, that may be talked out and resolved without report. Important is that the person won't use weapons again in future to reduce health of people for torturing.)</p>

                <p>But checking the end page... I am rather convinced Hua was mistaking something. It says Chao was hitting Hua and not Chao was attacking Hua. Hitting means Chao must not have used the knife but his fists before torturing.. Attacking means knife was used.<br>To be sure only judges would know after checking report.<br>As you see only full access to information can lead to a fair handling of the case.</p><p>And anyway, misunderstandings happen all the time and often also to me.<br>The most conflicts are results of misunderstandings.</p><p>And if judges woudl see such a misunderstanding they would keep that in mind too of course.<br>So away with the anger, fine? ^^</p>

No one bothered to checks actions. Like I said, my actions were fully human and You didn't even need to count my PA to check me.

Not so soon afterwards I spend my whole PA on piloting. So to counter your words:<br>2) Who said I wanted him to visit Raluca, who by the way, WASN'T at FBT as long as I remember anymore. Neither no one c<strong>hecked labs log</strong> or corridor/bridge/fat logs. (Which provides that You just jumped into topic without reading previous posts)<br>3) Raluca herself had "alarmed" Chun and here is something that "HAPPENED" not "MIGHT HAPPEN".

                <p>All right, that's enough. I am sorry that I did not see how badly this thread had been derailed, or I would have closed it sooner.</p><p>To sum up :</p><p>- If someone threatens to report you for a bad reason, or actually reports you, then you will be cleared. If the reason is really bad, they can even get a warning for abusive report. <strong>You cannot report someone for threatening you or reporting you.</strong></p><p>- Using torture is not reportable, unless it is really used abusively : for instance lowering health too much, doing it with a knife or blaster (which <strong>did not</strong> happen here), not healing or asking for healing when health is too low...</p><p>- In this case it was not random, since it was caused by a passage through an unprotected room where someone was standing. Even if it was used wrongly because no spore could have been extracted, it is just bad play, not griefing, and <strong>bad play is not reportable</strong> (I am not saying that it was bad play in that case, I did not see the logs and cannot judged based on two subjective stories).</p><p>If there are more questions, please contact the <a target="_blank" href="https://twinoid.com/tid/groupDiscuss">moderators</a>.</p>
