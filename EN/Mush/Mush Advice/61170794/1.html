                <p>We usually join ships most of inactive and semi-active people, but sometimes it's quite the otherwise. Sometimes, we get lucky, find ourselves in a thriving ship, getting a decent chance to collect scrap, invent an RFS, plant a jumpkin and find Eden. However, while we're dreaming about all these things, a grumpy Mush goes rampage, killing a few of crucial people or sabotaging sensitive equipment which puts the humanity in danger of extinction. The result of the rampage is either the loss of human team or forced rushed return to Sol in order to survive. In both cases: we finish the game and join another semi-active ship. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>To resist the rampage and keep the ship going, you don't have to rush with Mush hunting, trying to kill the Mush before they kill you and sacrificing innocent souls. This guide is for those who want to enjoy their long voyages and those who want to protect their ships from an unexpected attack of the Mush <em>(and possibly griefers as well.)</em></p><p><strong><em>Disclaimer: This guide doesn't give any guarantees! Counters can be found. It's your responsibility to secure the ship as well as you can.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Mush usually attacks:</strong></p><ul><li>shortly after selection (first 24 hours),</li><li>during day changes,</li><li>when vital resources of ship or human are in danger (oxygen, armor, morale),</li><li>once they realize humans are going to kill them,</li><li>in random time.</li></ul><p>It's good to be vigilant during these moments, but the Mush usually attacks when they're prepared, but humans are not. Also, the purpose of this guide is to make you feel safe even if you're unable to be active when the Mush attacks. <em>The others are active though.</em> So, overall, as soon as Mush is selected</p><p><strong>Hide the items!</strong><br>What? <strong>Grenade, knife, one extinguisher</strong> (or its blueprint) and while you're doing expo - <strong>Hacker Kit</strong>.<br>Where? Anywhere that <strong>doesn't reveal <em>secret</em> logs</strong>. Neither you should hide them in any of <strong><em>storages</em></strong> or <strong><em>the Lab</em></strong>, as these objects are seen through the radio and the Research Lab, respectively.<br>Who? Have <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chun</strong> hide them. If she's inactive/dead/griefer, ask somebody trusted. The best alternative person would be <strong>you!</strong> <em>because you know you're human, don't you?</em> The responsibility to hide items might be split between people who don't look suspicious.</p><p><strong>Protect sensitive skills!</strong><br>The list of sensitive skills the Mush would like to wipe out:</p><ul><li><strong>Technician</strong> - no technician, no PILGRED, no home. To make Mush less interested in killing technicians, you'd like to advance PILGRED, but not too much, otherwise they'll force return to Sol. It's a thin line, how to advance PILGRED - it depends on technician resources. If you're <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.vg/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Raluca</strong>, it's best for your interest to raise standards. Remember, without technicians you're still able to fix PILGRED with the crew, but it requires renunciation of other work from several crewmates.</li><li><strong>Pilot</strong> - it usually appears when there's a horde of hunters or/and armor is low. You need to keep doing your work efficiently then. Collect scrap for hull and Mush will be less interested in attacking you.</li><li><strong>Morale source</strong> - may include <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chun</strong>, but she might be killed as the last. The best counter would be to provide morale to all the crew as soon as possible, so Mush will lose interest in attacking you.</li><li><strong>Tracker</strong> - be careful, when Mush attacks a tracker, it usually means they want to hide their Beta, so if you're <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Eleesha</strong>, you better do your job. Finding the Mush is hard, but observing actions of people who could possibly get dirty might be enough.</li></ul><p>It's optimal to have one of these people wear <strong>Plastenite Armor</strong>, but it should be provided discreetly so Mush doesn't know who actually wears it. You also might ask for protection from...</p><p><strong>The Pacifist</strong><br>This trait wasn't given to <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Ian</strong> in order to sleep in the Medlab alone for research and gardening purposes. He's the only one who condemns violence. Have him stay in either of dorms to protect the most important people. This will sure complicate the Mush plans for a rampage. It's the best if he was active during Mush rampage, as he can disturb them.</p><div class="tid_editorContent tid_warnContent tid_parsed"><p><span class="tid_mod">Thread edited to remove wrong information leading to incorrect theories.</span></p></div>

                <p><strong><em>Transfer</em></strong><br>When the Mush goes rampage, <strong>always</strong> take the possibility of using the transfer. You can see it if the rampaging person has no skills - it's not Mush anymore (unless they had no skills before). If you see it, you should warn other people <em>because you shouldn't suppose them to be as percipient as you.</em> The Mush may lie about being transferred human, so you ought to check for skills first.</p><p>Be careful when the Mush is alive as you might be transferred at any time. If you survive, you shouldn't pick your skills (except for proper ones that may help you kill the Mush) and you should tell other people. If you can't speak due to no talkie (the Mush may most likely leave it somewhere) and you can't find it, either you should:</p><ul><li>whisper to the people being in the same room as you;</li><li>use post-it notes to write (it's the only way to let them know if you have torn tongue);</li><li>go to the Bridge, where you can chat without talkie.</li></ul><p>As it's said, it may happen at any time as long as the Mush is alive. After the transfer, the Mush takes possession over your health, your action points, your equipment, your outfit, your private channels, your day limits, your lovers and your title while you're owning theirs. To be prepared in case of transfer, you ought to read the following tips:</p><ul><li>Don't hold any crucial items that may help the Mush during rampage (Knife, Blaster as Shooter character, etc.)</li><li>Close channels that contain information which would help the Mush in rampage, such as where the crucial items are hidden. Information about suspects isn't that important to rampaging Mush.</li><li>If you play as <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chao.png" alt=":mush_chao_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chao</strong>, <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/derek.png" alt=":mush_derek_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Derek</strong>, <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/stephen.png" alt=":mush_stephen_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Stephen</strong>, you shouldn't fill your AP bar. If any of these characters are inactive, you should sell or kill them asap.</li></ul><p>Be very careful during expeditions. Most strategies include transfer when it goes to leave participants on the planet. When it's succeeded, you lose the crew, Icarus and resources collected on the planet. It makes much more difficult to continue the journey even if you get rid of the Mush. These are following tips how to best secure your expedition team from being left behind (more tips used, better security):</p><ul><li>Have current commander participate during the expedition.</li><li>If one of inactive ex-commanders or <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> don't take part in the expedition, don't launch the expedition before cycle change.</li><li>Have <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chun</strong> hold the <strong>Hacker Kit</strong> during expedition or hide it.<ul><li>If all of above tips are fulfilled and the expedition doesn't contain possible events where you may lose an item, you can consider taking the <strong>Hacker Kit</strong> to the expedition.</li></ul></li><li>Have a non-commander guard Front Corridor when the Hacker Kit and commander aren't by the Bridge side. More guards, better defense. <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chun</strong> serves the best purpose.<ul><li>It's recommended to deplete your action points before guarding to prevent possible transfers (don't forget to leave some AP for guarding and pacifism makes it cost more).</li></ul></li></ul><p><br><br><strong><em>Phagocyte</em></strong><br>Nothing might be as frightening as the Mush eating the whole spore limit to cause serious damage to the ship. It's effective during day changes as the limit is doubled so it's recommended to be very active at the time. To make day changes safer, it's advised to complete <strong>Constipaspore Serum</strong> research, before the day ends for the best. The Mush will have to forget about taking advantage of this skill while planning a rampage.</p><p><br><br><strong><em>Pyromaniac</em></strong><br>And there goes the purpose of why you should hide an extinguisher. But even if it's been found, the Mush will most likely dismantle them or steal them hijacking a patrol ship or Pasiphae, leaving Daedalus on fire. Most human plans include rushing Sol, but if you want to enjoy the next weeks on board, these are ways how to deal with the fire:</p><ul><li>If <strong>Magnetic Net</strong> hasn't been refused as a project and the Mush holds extinguishers outside, rush projects or upgrade NERON until you get this project. You may refuse time-consuming projects to win the race with fire once you eliminate the Mush.</li><li>If you suspect <strong>Blueprint: Extinguisher</strong> hasn't been taken by the Mush, you should search for it around Daedalus. Remember that there are 3 random blueprints (except for grenade and sofa BP). If you're certain the BP hasn't been spawned, contact Xyloph to receive blueprints. Then build it.</li><li>Take <strong>Firefighter</strong> - extinguish the fire manually. It's really tough as you'll be able to extinguish average 1-2 rooms with full AP bar. In addition, it makes you dirty and it'll get you hurt average every second attempt, so call for medical help and protection because you're very vulnerable to attacks after trying to rescue the ship.</li><li>Take <strong>Robotics Expert</strong> - use scrap to upgrade your drones to Fireman and Turbo and let them extinguish the fire. It's more powerful than Firefighter, as the risk of injury is limited to upgrading and a single drone is more efficient.</li></ul><p><br><br>You may print Mage Books to obtain proper skills. You may also install <strong>Automatic Sprinklers</strong> to make the fire spread much slower (single fire can be put out, I doubt it would work for several rooms). This way you might continue your voyage despite fire ignited randomly. Don't forget to deal with the Mush, leaving behind once extinguishers aren't needed.</p><p><br><br><br><strong>Summary</strong><br>Those were the frequent ways of Mush leading to human extinction. Prepare for them so you'll raise your chance to survive and that the triumph won't stop quickly in Sol. Don't forget to keep doing research. You won't be overwhelmed by the Mush then and you won't have to care about who the Mush is. Let them live until their time comes, just don't let them spread.<br><span class="tid_sideNote">I would be grateful for your feedback.</span></p>

                <p>Well firstly going back to Sol with mush is a mush win and a human loss. It is also punishable to KNOWINGLY do so if you're human. The story/rp reasons are unimportant.</p><p>Secondly, rampages are only weak if you're giving up with a simple 1 for 1 trade. I've seen and been a part of rampages that have killed over half the crew using only 2 mush (of which I was demeaned for by a few members of the human crew). But it is a toxic attitude to ever consider someone's attempts at a victory to be lesser than other attempts as it tends to make all attempts afterwards feel more hopeless. That's when you see lazy long-time players just do whatever little thing they can in order to get killed and be done with it. It's best to leave behind all thoughts about "lame victories" because those thoughts are toxic at the core. Keep that to yourself (Though I've been guilty of this a few times but it feels good when you finally mature out of it).</p><p>But really humans can avoid most every tactic. If the mush finish Pilgred then humans weren't paying attention. If humans were all murdered in a rampage then they didn't protect the right people or defend the weapons (spoiler: Chun isn't really important).</p><p>So... Basically... When you're Mush, you have a mission. How you choose to go about that mission is your choice so long as the mission is forefront in your mind. If rampaging seems like the best idea then go for it. If converting seems like a crappy choice but the most entertaining choice then GO FOR IT. If you think you can successfully complete Pilgred and pull off a big human upset then, by god it is your divine right as the superior being. Never let someone's toxic "Your win is lesser and therefore I don't take any responsibility for my failures" attitudes stop you from blooming as the mushroom you are!</p>

                <p>Agreed with Shadow. You are free to hold yourself to whatever standard you want. When you start holding others to your standards that's when the toxicity comes in. Not that I'm saying you do. Yet it is a problem in games. You'll either see a mush give up and kill some unimportant character and solidify a human victory or you'll see a mush who missteps their plan and is killed then you'll get the occasional comment of disappointment. It can be extremely discouraging. In my opinion, it's better to see a mush try a simple tactic rather than big brain it so much that it just wasn't a practical plan for the given ship.</p><p>I think we're kind of straying from the topic.

                <p>Again... It is not a draw to return to Sol with mush on board. It will always be a Mush victory and human loss. Rp/Glory reasons do not matter. If you need rp reasoning then humanity's heroes return without being able to cure the mush. Also humanity's greatest and brightest came home with sleeper agents. No matter which way you look at it, the Mush are destined to win. You can not let them bring you home.</p><p>If we started calling going to Sol with mush a draw then humans can simply build Pilgred which solidifies their victory in the event of a Mush defeat. The Mush will always take that "draw" because in the event of them being killed then humans automatically win with Pilgred already being up. Whereas if Mush do off all the technicians without them completing Pilgred then it definitely is still possible for human's to win.</p><p>It is your responsibility as human crew to make sure Mush can't rush Pilgred (which is a fairly difficult process to begin with barring Mush Comms officer making a deal). You can't just shrug and remove all responsibility by saying it's a draw. The crew made a mistake and lost for it.

                <p>So you need to explain why it's a win. You need a reason. I gave one RP and one based on the glory system, you gave none.</p><p>The meta could be wrong, but I explained why the meta is right in this case and it's a bad idea to build PILGRED even if it's a draw. It's a good excuse to be dirty, and everytime a Mush know he's going to be discovered (RIIIIING) he would rather transfert into Jin Su and take the draw rather than loose. Everytime they get bored or in low spirit, they would do that to take the draw and start a new ship rather than afk 3 days and lose.</p>

                <p>Again, your rp/glory reasoning is irrelevant as it does not have a place in the competition of Mush vs Humans. And I did give a reason. It is a Mush win because it serves as a method of restricting human play. What's to stop a human from jumping to Sol when the Mush set fire to the whole ship just to "draw" what is most likely a loss? Or to have them build up Pilgred and say "Remember, taking us back is a draw! Don't do it if you want. Meanwhile we're going to have all this coffee." And using drinking coffee as an excuse to get dirty leaves many issues for the Mush, regardless. Like where the AP went so it's not a good reasoning for the mush side as to why it's fair.</p><p>Also, as a judge, I can tell you with 100% certainty that a human will get in trouble for knowingly taking the ship back with Mush on board. The Mush, on the other hand, will not. So by the basis of the community as a whole (you're literally the only person I have ever seen call it a draw) it is a Mush win. Also by the basis of of the system we use to try to keep the game fair and weed out those who ruin the game, it is also a Mush win. So that is the reasoning as to why it's a mush win.</p><p>I need to make these things clear because I do not want it spreading through the community that it's a "draw" because it's not and people may get in trouble with that belief. Not to mention it's just rude to tell your competitors that their hard work lead to nothing. A Pilgred rush is not easy.</p>

                <p>Reason based on the gameplay: it diminishes the human glory, and gives Mush a special achievement.<br>Reason based on the roleplay: if the humans land in Mush-controlled territory, they get killed/infected very quickly. If they land in non-Mush controlled zones (the rebellion, the famous bases), Mush have immediate knowledge of where this place is, and people on the inside that can contaminate/sabotage as much as they want.<br>Extremely clearly a Mush win, being hypocritical won't change it.</p><p>Your reasons are... extremely weird. Because if you consider it a draw because of meta, it means the game is <strong>hyper extremely duper</strong> unbalanced as it has at least <strong>ten times more</strong> human victory than Mush victory (in strict theoretical possibilities, it's even worse if you think of practical number). Excuse to be dirty really doesn't mean anything, because you can get dirty cooking, loading fuel, eating, or you can just walk into Bravo Dorm (to sleep), or even stay dirty (some rare people have pulled that off actually). So really, your reasoning is extremely flimsy and would make this game a ridiculous one, totally impossible to play as a Mush and not even really interesting as a human.<br>If that's your vision of what Mush is, well I'm sad for you, but it's not going to change how I play nor how I view the game.</p><p>EDIT: And also all of the previous said by <span class="tid_user tid_user_8046890 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8046890">BadBlanket</span> <em>damned, he was quicker</em></p>

Werewolves (a board game) is also unbalanced and easier for humans. Games don't need to be balanced as you switch roles after each games.</p><p><strong>2° Mush win because humans don't win</strong>: This is not cluedo at all. And the goal is not just to find Mushes, there are many objectives and this is just one among others, the main goal being to cure humanity. Also you are saying Mush win because Humans don't win, not wining doesn't mean you loose and doesn't mean either the other team win, that's the very concept of a draw: no one win and no one loose.</p><p><strong>3° Achievement for infiltrating Sol</strong>: You get an achievement for reaching day 5, reaching day 10, etc and also making the PILGRED. That doesn't mean you win.</p><p><strong>4° Humans land in a Mush controlled territory on Sol</strong>: Going to sol doesn't land the ship, you are in orbit with maybe more hunters, I agree it doesn't help the humans to go there but it doesn't help the Mush either to get their infiltrated reveal themselves and get killed. We don't know what happens next. On the other hand if you destroy the daedalus we know what happens.</p><p><strong>5° It's hard to do so it's a win</strong> It's not so hard to do, you just need to be a Raluca silver with an active Mush to relay you. And I can find many ridiculous things harder to do that are not win but I was lazy.</p><p>So I think reason 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°, 5° are groundless, remain reason 6° and I have to admit you won the argument here. This is the only reason it's a Mush win when it should be a draw.</p>

                <p>1) That's totally false, and unbalanced game is not a good game to play, and however did you find that werewolf was unbalanced? I'll give you a small tip: it's only unbalanced if you choose an unbalanced composition. Meaning if you're an intelligent person, it's a very balanced and fun game to play. But clearly you aren't because you have given me in this whole debate no evidence of rational, intelligent argumentation, only picking out random facts and twisting them as far as they can go to make them go your way.</p><p>2) There aren't many goals actually in Mush, there's one: find a way to defeat the Mush. It declines into several smaller objectives, such as escaping it on Eden, or going back to Sol with a way to cure (and so eradicate) it, or even going back to Sol to help the rebellion. If you do <strong>any</strong> of those with Mushes aboard, it's clear that you haven't truly achieved that, as theses Mushes will be able to prevent you from destroying the others/to help them destroy you.<br><strong>Try</strong> to put yourself in situation: you're in a raging fight for the life-and-death of entire species. None of them is going to surrender and even less find a happy compromise. <strong>Where do you find your draw???</strong> It's simple, there isn't.</p><p>3) It doesn't mean you win, but it means it's a goal worth reaching. Take chess, for example, there's the concept of stalemate which is a draw. Sometimes, it's the best option you can get as it prevents you from losing, but there's <strong>never</strong> going to be a player who is happy of achieving that and thinks it an "achievement". Achievements aren't always direct winning, but it's something worth achieving. And a draw isn't something worth achieving, it's a rather boring, last-chance-option kind of thing.</p><p>4) Going back to Sol doesn't mean "going back near Sol but actually we're going to fire the engines again and escape several light-years from here". It means going back to Sol, in which there are probably fleets of thousands of Hunters (what were you saying about Daedalus destroyed?), if you stay in the air you'll 100% be destroyed. And if you land, if you have Mushes with you you'll be destroyed too, because you can't hide.</p><p>5) No, because you also need humans (like you actually, who played so badly you have to be hypocritical about it and invent arguments to justify yourself) to not notice anything, which is actually extremely hard when the humans don't <strong>let it happen</strong>. And I speak from experience, I've already done that once only to be stopped at the last second by an extra-ap wound inflicted by an active crewmember which prevented my crewmate from pressing the "back to Sol" button. A PILGRED rush as Mush is no easy thing, I suggest you only play Raluca and then try to do that on your next time as Mush. You'll be killed for excessive dirtiness and wanting to bring Mushes back to Sol before you can get Pilgred half done.</p><p>6) Actually you got that argument all wrong, because it actually is: <strong><em>The creator of the game clearly made it this way</em></strong>. So except if you really thing you know Mush better than the ones who actually invented it, please go take your ego elsewhere, and don't wonder about why you got a ban for bringing Mushes back to Sol on purpose.</p><p>This was the last time I answered, this topic was too flooded already. Say whatever you want and stay hypocritical, no one believes you and no one will answer you. You're alone.</p>

                <p>Most mush PILGRED rushes start with mush Raluca pushing the PILGRED up to about 25%. (in the efficiency page, that corresponds to 2 PILGRED Points + 1 AP) If Raluca has a tech alpha, or mush Jin Su, all she needs is a mission or a reasonable number of relays to win. It's legitimately difficult to stop it in these cases. Might be worth it to add some support for this in your guide.</p><p>However, @BobyCarrote, I think many people here are in consensus that what you're saying is wrong. From an RP and practical standpoint, if you cannot stop the mush and get back to Sol, the mush have insider agents that make them win. The only way you can hope for a human victory is to eradicate the mush. Of course, what happens next on a mush free ship is another story, but you increase your success by building RFS and going to Eden (reflected by glory)</p>

                <p>You're talking about half a bar of ap being easy to get. Do you even realise how ridiculous you sound, still trying to prove something so you don't have to admit that you were wrong about anything?<br>Also last I looked Raluca was antisocial, so all she needs to do is pull two spores and then do absolutely nothing for another entire day sleeping in a dorm with Janice. Absolutely not suspicious, perfectly un-noticeable for humans. Impossible to counter, really.</p>

                <p>CS is good to stop on-the-fly AP gain from sporing and phagocyting. But if you pull a spore, possibly even before Gas, and then hold on to that it's still an extra 4 AP on top of your bar.</p><p>And it is easy to get half a bar, or even a full bar, if you just hang in the back pretending to be inactive for a while. Few people will kill you just for that. And/or you can save up some AP slowly by just slacking a little in between, because once you have the 1-2 spores banked there really is no rush.</p><p>On top of that, it's 3 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_pilgred.png" alt=":mush_pa_pilgred:" class="tid_ico"> if you do it on a day change. Even if you just picked Physicist a minute earlier, which in turn will make you seem like even less of a danger beforehand with only Tech.</p><p>Believe me, it's not hard, even from 0%. I've done it. (Also I wrote that table.)</p><br><p>Obviously, none of this means that it is somehow not a win.</p><p>It is also not "unstoppable" if you are aware (or listen to people <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">). You can guard FC during day changes, for example, to make it a lot harder. <em>Especially</em> as Chun.</p><p>If you ask me, this just has to become meta. - To guard like this if the danger is obvious, and to go through with murdering Ralucas who do not actively prove that they are working, much like we murder people who hog the apron. After a couple of ships any Raluca would learn this, and know what they are signing up for.</p><p>It's just that people are not aware, and keep underestimating the danger.</p>

                <p>Where are the post-it notes? My ears have been injured and I desperately need a way to communicate (as I'm a tracker). I've been trying to get healed but there has been someone in the surgery bed for many cycles, and I can't really tell them to get up can I? Another question, I know it works for illnesses, but does sessions with a shrink help injuries as well? That could be an alternative to getting healed. Also, as you can probably tell, I'm new to this game, as in this is my first game ever, and I haven't been able to find really any information on the many questions I have, so if any of you know of a good, extensive, guide to this game, please let me know!</p>
