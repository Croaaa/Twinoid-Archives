                <p>Please humans ALWAYS lose (at least 80%) on my ships. The "you can't do food tests (which is fair I guess...) you can't "use natamy test" means mush will ALWAYS win. Mush screws up? They were bad mush cause NO sane mush would spore or do anything bad if they were good. If there were myco alarms then still that doesn't mean a human win.</p><p>I formally ask for a petition and it may not even be looked at. But I am SUPER tired of losing every ship. If mush do nothing bad the answer is, "on expos and rotten food eventually you'll find the mush through diseases." SCREW that logic cause that takes WAY too long probably day 20 which random ships don't last to.</p><p>Unless you join a casting who has preset things to harm mush or people eat twice to prove to narrow down unfairly then yeah no way to find out.</p><p>Example of unfair: On the ship I was assassinated as raluca I managed to convert finola and she anonymushed WITHOUT getting caught. Me and stephen died BUT eleesha was afk so there was NO way to tell if there was anonymush. Pilgred completed meant humans LOST. No convertions needed mush wins from human behavior G G</p>

                <p>While your post is very open to ridicule because you mistake anecdotal evidence/opinion as fact, I'll give you an honest answer:</p><p>The balance on random ships will always be wonky because they see a wide variety of players with equally variable skill- and activity levels. With that said it is my opinion based on close to a hundred random ships that Mush are generally not overpowered on random ships. It all depends on the experience of your crew, what skills they have and how active and helpful they are. There will be ships with complete pushover human crews and there will be others with such a level of organisation and investigation that extracting even a single spore would get you killed right away and I've seen both examples many times myself.</p><p>According to the dev the winrate for Mush is lower than that of the humans as well. If you're having trouble beating the Mush on your ships you might want to look at what you can do to stop them instead of what others can do to nerf them.</p>

                <p>Since this is a repeat thread, the kid gloves are coming off.<br><span class="tid_mod">NO. This is yet another thread from you asking for this, and you are getting the same answer as last time: No. If you create yet another thread ask for this, you're going to take a long break from the forum for wasting our time. Never mind the <em><strong>actual statistics,</strong></em> that Mush only win about 40% of the time. But I told you all of this the last time you asked. Do these facts not matter to you?<br><br>The game is already biased in favor of the human team.<br><br>You can't use the Natamy Rifle for testing anyone, and you invite a sanction if you do so. If we don't forbid its use for anything other than assassinations, people will use it and shoot people randomly - and just as I told you every OTHER time you've brought up the Natamy Rifle, you can ONLY use the Rifle if you have enough evidence to execute someone. It's for <strong>assassinations</strong>, not <em>investigations</em>.<br><br>Don't like the rules? Tough. Screw your impatience. Become a better investigator and a better player.<br><br>If you're losing as human 80% of the time, that says far more about the quality of your own gameplay than the quality of the Mush team. I know this firsthand, since I've not only shipped with you, our ship <em>wasted the RFS</em> on you, because you were BY FAR the most suspicious player. Bronze Apprentice, who claimed to have never been on an expo before...and you know what? You seemed to be an experienced Mush who was pretending to be much less experienced than you were, despite playing long enough as a Bronze player to have Apprentice.</span></p><p>And with that said, THREAD LOCKED.</p>
