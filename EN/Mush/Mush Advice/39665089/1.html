                <p>Hello everyone! This here thread is to talk about everyone's favorite billionaire/caffeine guzzling/father figure <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/gioele.png" alt=":mush_gioele_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Gioele</strong>! This here isn't a complete guide, so any input or opinions are welcome!</p><p><em><strong>Recommended Activity Level</strong></em> - Fairly low - mid if <strong>Jin Su</strong> is active and human, but in many cases a high activity level is required, as you are third in line for the commander title behind <strong>Jin Su</strong> and <strong>Chao</strong>, and that role needs to be the most active on the ship in most cases.</p><p><em><strong>Special Trait</strong></em> - None</p><p><em><strong>Skills</strong></em></p><ul><li><em>Solid</em> - A decent skill, but nothing to write home about. Unfortunately completely broken for <em>mush</em>, doesn't provide any sort of bonus as a <em>mush</em> player. If you're human, it allows you to carry a heavy object with no penalty, gives you +1 damage to unarmed attacks, and allows you the option to <strong>Kick Out</strong> someone, which for a cost of 2 AP (1 if the character is inactive) will let you knock a character out of the room. This allows you (as a human) to knock those inactives to a storage room to be traded away, but carries all the risk of RNG, as you can't choose where to throw someone. Can also be used to get rid of an annoying Ian that a mush might be hiding behind. Cheap skill and easy to acquire, would be nice to have it fixed for <em>mush</em>. Not a great choice of a skill, but is always appreciated to have at least one on board.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Paranoid</em> - Gives the character 2 extra cameras. A nice enough skill for humans, and unfortunately one of the only skills that a <em>mush</em> <strong>Gioele</strong> can make use of. With 5 cameras, you have more safe rooms, but they can easily be worked around as mush. Good for both humans and <em>mush</em>, and works well on shorter ships, so typically it's the only skill you would want to take before <em>mush</em> selection, if you have the choice.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Caffeine Junkie</em> - <strong>Gioele</strong>'s bread and butter skill on ships with a finished PILGRED. Gives you +2 AP for each coffee. Obviously, doesn't work for a <em>mush</em>, since coffee is a consumable. If you are human and you know the ship will last a while, this skill gives you a huge amount of freedom to do a lot of things, and gives you priority for all that wonderful delicious coffee. If PILGRED is repaired, then you have the ability to gain 32 AP a day alone from coffee, and never have to eat again. With a <em>Medic</em> book, you become the ultimate healer. <em>Tech</em> book - The greatest <em>Technician</em> besides a creative <strong>Stephen</strong>. It complements nearly any AP intensive task, and has a huge amount of freedom, rivaled only by <strong>Ian</strong>'s <em>Frugivore</em> skill in AP gain. Gives a bonus to the NERON Project <strong>Fission Coffee Roaster</strong>.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Astrophysicist</em> - Usually a role held by <strong>Frieda</strong>, it allows you to find a planet for 1 AP less and reveals an additional zone with each scan. Good skill to have in combination with <em>Caffeine Junkie</em>, and one of few skills that works for <strong>Gioele</strong> as a <em>mush</em>. Allows you to fill in for <strong>Frieda</strong> in the event she's dead, inactive, etc. I won't go into much detail with this skill, as it's rare you'll have a good reason for using it, but it's nice to have. Gives a bonus to the NERON Projects <strong>CPU Overclocking</strong> and <strong>Quantum Sensors</strong>.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Panic</em> - Gives you +1 AP and +1 MP for each cycle where at least 50% of the crew is <em>mush</em>. An absolutely pointless skill, as if you get the chance to use it mush have already won in most cases. If you're human and 50% of the crew is <em>mush</em>, then you're probably dead. If you're <em>mush</em> in this scenario, not sure if the skill works, but you've already won, this is just salt in the wound. The only real reason to get this skill is to allow gold players to pretend to be bronze, since most of <strong>Gioele</strong>'s skills are useless to the <em>mush</em>.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Victimizer</em> - High in Xp cost, this is a skill you should really only take if you are dedicated to the <em>mush </em>hunt and are gold. It allows you to give someone the <strong>Pariah</strong> status for 1 AP, which makes all actions 20% less likely to be successful, makes all <strong>Covert</strong> actions <strong>Secret</strong>, and upon death grants you 8 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> if the victim is <em>mush</em>, but makes you lose 8 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> if the victim is human. In most cases, the 500 Xp is better spent elsewhere, but if you want to be focused on the <em>mush </em>hunt, then it could be a viable replacement for <em>Solid</em>. Still, if you are using it, make sure the person you target is not involved in something chance-based, such as research, projects, etc. If they are Involved in <em>Piloting</em>, <em>Technician</em>, or <em>Astrophysicist</em> roles, make sure you really think about who you make a <strong>Pariah</strong>.</li></ul>

                <p><em><strong>Bronze</strong></em></p><ul><li><em>Solid</em> - Your first skill available, and common for newbies to have. Like mentioned before, gives you a few slightly helpful things to do, and lets you kill faster. If you're <em>mush</em> however, it gives you no bonus. You'll not get the damage bonus, the ability to <strong>Kick Out</strong>, or the ability to carry heavy items. If you have a choice as bronze and mush haven't been selected, best to not choose this.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Paranoid</em> - The 2 free cameras are nice to have as human, and can be worked around easily as <em>mush</em>, not to mention it's only 5 XP. A good choice for both parties to have, especially since many ships won't get PILGRED repaired to make full use of <em>Caffeine Junky</em> anyways. Take this, place your cameras, and then just become another generalist, filling in wherever you are needed.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Caffeine Junky</em> - On longer ships, it's the best skill for a human <strong>Gioele</strong> to have. With PILGRED repaired you can complete a huge number of tasks, becoming the ultimate healer, technician, or whatever role the ship needs. Doesn't work as <em>mush</em>, but if you're on a slower ship many people will steal your coffee anyways, even if you try to threaten them, so you might be able to get by for a short while with this as <em>mush</em>.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Astrophysicist</em> - Gives you a great bonus in planet scanning, but is overshadowed by the effect of 8 coffees a day with <em>Caffeine Junky</em>, and if you take it as your only skill, it may be seen as an attempt to hide being <em>mush</em>, as at 255 Xp you should be able to see that <em>Paranoid</em> and <em>Caffeine Junky</em> are better skills to have.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Panic</em> and <em>Victimizer</em> - Neither of these sills should be taken at any level, and if you do surely the crew will kill you. A waste of your only skill slot.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Silver</strong></em></p><ul><li><strong><em>MUSH</em></strong> - You're better off pretending to be a bronze with <em>Paranoid</em>, or maybe you can pull it off with <em>Solid</em>, since moving crew around is usually a waste of AP given the chances of throwing an inactive into storage (25% is the best chance you get, in Rear Corridor). Either way, <em>Solid</em> needs to be fixed badly, like <em>Wrestler</em> was.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Caffeine Junky</em> + <em>Paranoid</em> - Gives you the free cameras and gives you the nice bonus from the coffee machine. Like previously mentioned, gives you a huge amount of freedom once PILGRED is repaired. A powerful combo that does a lot of good for you.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Caffeine Junky</em> + <em>Astrophysicist</em> - Gives all the bonus of <em>Astrophysicist</em> in addition to a huge boost in AP from <em>Caffeine Junky</em>. You'll be able to scan huge numbers of planets, and allows you to replace <strong>Frieda</strong> if need be. Still, if you've got <em>Caffeine Junky</em> you might get caught up doing other things, so it's not always the best course of action, not to mention you lose out on the free cameras <em>Paranoid</em> gives you.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Caffeine Junky</em> + <em>Solid</em> - Cheaper than the combo with <em>Astrophysicist</em>, but still gives you a bit to do, not to mention makes the task of killing <em>mush</em> easier. Don't ever take this as <em>mush</em> however, that's just suicide. Nice choice all around, but <em>Paranoid</em> is almost always better than <em>Solid</em>.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Solid</em> + <em>Paranoid</em> - Very, very cheap to acquire and decent enough all around, but lacking the bonus from <em>Caffeine Junky</em>. Still, not bad to have, since you get cameras, the ability to move around heavy items, and can push people around like you own the ship (because you do! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> ). Also a decent cover as <em>mush</em>, so long as you can avoid trying to move people around.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Gold</strong></em></p><ul><li><strong><em>MUSH</em></strong> - Same thing as silver, but you have to pump out that 250 Xp for a worthless skill if you want to be able to pretend to be bronze.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Solid</em> + <em>Paranoid</em> + <em>Caffeine Junky</em> + <em>Astrophysicist</em> - The only real choice for a gold <strong>Gioele</strong>. Extra cameras, <strong>Kick Out</strong>, +2 AP from coffee, and the ability to scan planets in your down time. A powerful combination, especially on longer trips. Makes you the ultimate generalist behind <strong>Stephen</strong> with <em>Creative</em> + <em>Frugivore</em>. If a <em>Medic</em> book appears, you are one of the few people besides <strong>Chun</strong> that should read it, as with a repaired PILGRED and 8 coffees a day, you can heal nearly any physical ailment.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Tips for In-Game</strong></em></p><p>With <em>Paranoid</em>, you can put cameras in each dorm, in the lab, in the bridge, and in the Nexus (For Raluca to hang out). Kill anybody that breaks the rule of <strong>Nobody in the Medlab except Chun and a researcher</strong> without good reason, at least until mycoalarms are researched. <em>Caffeine Junky</em> opens up a lot of options, especially with PILGRED repaired. You are a Generalist, so make sure you ask around for where you are most needed. You are high in the line for the commander title, so keep this in mind in case you lose <strong>Jin Su</strong>, since you'll have to take on his responsibilities if he dies, goes inactive, etc. If you have <em>Astrophysicist</em>, be prepared to scan for planets if a situation arises where you need one found soon.</p><p><em><strong>Mush Play</strong></em></p><p><strong>Gioele</strong> is severely hampered as mush, with two of his four skills being useless as <em>mush</em>. <em>Solid</em> almost never sees use, and is generally safe to have, but if you have to move someone, try and get someone else to do it. <em>Paranoid</em> is the only "safe" skill as mush, since you can put up the cameras and go on about your day. Not to mention a bronze <strong>Gioele</strong> with <em>Paranoid</em> is not at all unheard of, and is nowhere near enough evidence to kill someone on. You are second in line for the commander title while <strong>Chao</strong> is MIA, so be prepared to use that to your advantage, whether it means killing pilots, rushing PILGRED, or giving missions to your partner.</p><p><em><strong>Role Play</strong></em></p><p>There's several ways to go about this! You're paranoid, you love your daughter, you are a billionaire, you have a childhood love of the stars, you run a convict labor enterprise! So many thins to work with here. You are older than everyone else besides <strong>Frieda</strong>, not to mention you control their paychecks. Don't let anybody touch your precious little snowflake <strong>Paola</strong>! Especially that SDF fanboy/fangirl <strong>Andie</strong> or the goofball <strong>Derek</strong>. Who has time for self-righteous personalities like <strong>Eleesha</strong>? You're also quite lonely, maybe <strong>Frieda</strong> is the only one who understands you. You own this ship, but you didn't design it, why didn't that fool <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> build a ship that won't fall apart on you? You could also be a billionaire playboy, chasing tail wherever you can, and revel in stories of beautiful ladies you have spent time with, much to the displeasure of your crew. One of my favorite personalities to play as from a role play perspective.</p>

                <p>Decent guide though. It's annoying that Gioele's skillset is so horrible for mush. And his first 4 skills aren't even really anti-mush, the one that is happens to be the safest option. Crazy, man.</p>

                <p>Thanks!</p><p>Yeah, it's a shame <em>Solid</em> is broken, and there should at least be a mush skill that allows eating, maybe make it high up. Having a character where the only decent skill for mush aids humans is a pain. He's a powerful human, such a shame that power doesn't carry over to mush. A bit unbalanced in my opinion.</p><p>Also wish they would remove <em>victimizer</em>, or at least give it purpose. Having a level 6 skill that is completely useless seems like a waste. Not to mention you have to go through an equally useless level 5 skill to get to it.</p>

                <p>Victimizer is not so useless. Just use it on a person, who acts even a bit suspicious. Don't wait for any more proofs, don't wait for list or anything - just use. <br>It will make direct spiking quite impossiable, it will make rampage for that mush ineffective as well. Just remember - you are free to accuse people, who don't do anything chance-based- researchers, project team, comm officer, garden workers, most generalists. Think more if you are targeting tech, pilot, or those who are on planet scans.<br>Also skill is quite ok for mush to use before transfer. <br>Still doesn't cost 300+500exp...</p>

                <p>Fair enough, I see the arguments for Victimizer. If it was down to level 5, it might be worth something, but at level 6 it's so hard to reach that you could have better uses. For mush, there's so many better skills for 500 Xp that you can get to. For humans, unless all you play as is Gioele other characters have good skills (creative is amazing). And as human, what would you give up for victimizer? Solid? Paranoid? His other skills outweigh victimizer in my personal opinion (except Panic, but at least the level 5 slot lets a gold pretend to be bronze).</p><p>I guess my argument was more that it's not worth it's cost as a level 6 skill. Solid is about on par with victimizer in direct usefulness, and it's free! For 500 Xp you can get any character to level 4, level 5 for 505 Xp, not to mention how many levels of mush you can raise.</p>
