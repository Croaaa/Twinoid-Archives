                <p>Hello crew XD. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/stephen.png" alt=":mush_stephen_50:" class="tid_ico"> here XD. I know about the My Account butten broken thingy but I heard about a roundaway from the forum so I will make the AP thread ^^. <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4166." target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4166.</a> (not sure what title I should have given the ship ^^.</p><p>Where to start.... OOh, we made it back to Sol... WOOOOOT. PARTY.<br>In the beginning a LOT off people were inactive or were behaving like mushes. Eleesha Took Jin Su out because she printed list a little early and 1 mush was down. then Paola was killed but she was Human and I killed Terrence. people were starving from starvation while Terrence didn't die while standing in the FC for like ages so I killed him on the spot. 2nd mush down. I was commander since Derek also died from starvation.</p><p>After that things got better. I took Astro MB and found a good O2 planet and 1 other planet later on which expo's went FLAWLESS. thank you Andie XD.</p><p>Janice took Pilot MB and got my missions as she was the most active pilot and most trusty person on the entire ship (no offense Andie I just really liked Janice XD). Eleesha took logistics expert and did really good on comms... unless she went inactive and died from starvation.... sad...</p><p>All in all. the 7 people who were decently active returned to Sol on D11 C8. I went to bed in that cycle and we were desperate with the enormous hunter waves and no hacker kit (Eleesha, if you come online pls tell me where you left it ^^ I wanna know.</p><p>And that was my story as the Final captain of this ship. It was a great honour and a pleasure.</p><p>(this is my first time to write a report like this so pls forgive me if it sounds weird XD.</p><p>now, let me gamble who will be the second comment XD.</p><p>1.
