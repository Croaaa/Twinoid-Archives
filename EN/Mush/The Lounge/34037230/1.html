This was a great ship, especially given what we had to work with. For those who weren't online, we returned to Sol because Eleesha and Janice died and Jin Su was offline. With no idea when Jin Su would be back to stop the chain of morale deaths, and no idea if he'd give a speech if and when he returned, we didn't have many options. If we'd had a more active Jin Su, we'd have went longer, for sure.</p><p>Terrence, you were great. It was good to know that if I was sleeping or had a busy work day or whatnot, you had things. I'd love to organize a ship with you again, hopefully with more active humans! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Still wish you'd have let me punch Finola right away, but glad she didn't do much damage when she saw she'd been found out. ^^;</p><p>Ian, thanks for stepping up when and where needed. You were reliable and knowledgeable and that was nifty. Also, that alpha bay sofa turned out to not be so bad, helped Terrence hop around the ship better. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Janice.... ah, Janice. I had so much fun RPing with you. Was so sad that you didn't come back and munch more bananas there at the end. Were you able to see the frantic wall of texts I was dropping in pm after you died or does that go away? His betrothed suiciding before his eyes after his daughter met the same fate earlier on was too much for poor old Gioele. He'll never be the same. Coffee doesn't even taste good any more. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Roland, it was good to have you at our backs and in our patrol ships. Pretty quiet, but helped keep us alive and your random words were almost always amusing. That bit about Janice's death though, harsh man, harsh.</p><p>Finola and Chao, if you see this, I think this ship would have been very different had you two not been mush. We ended up with 4 really active players alive, 2 active enough, and 3 who would maybe be online or not. I wish they'd been mush, because you both seemed really active and helpful there at the beginning. Who knows what we'd have accomplished? But ah, c'est la vie.</p>

                <p>And if any of our mush see this, what <strong>was</strong> the deal with Frieda? Help convert someone then suicide? Her actions didn't seem to make much sense, given that she didn't even succeed in taking out Chun... if she wanted to do damage and go out in a blaze of glory, she'd have been a lot better off doing it once she had AP to actually, you know, do damage. Seemed like a blatant suicide from where I was sitting, but that's my uninformed perspective on the matter. o.O</p>

                <p>I was Ian. That was a great ship, it's too bad Janice and Eleesha died there at the end.</p><p>Let's see... what happened on this ship?</p><p>Three Mush (Finola, Frieda, Chao) were killed early, but they killed Chun first. So, no researchers, but no mush anyway.</p><p>Later on the ship we got a biologist mage book through Xyloph, and coffee-Gioele read it and alternated with others to finish the Retro-Fungal Serum (as well as some other helpful non-mush-fighting researches).</p><p>Paola was a somewhat-inactive new player who didn't do anything with comms that I know of and eventually went completely inactive and died. Eleesha did a few NERON upgrades and got most of the Xylophs, but because of Paola we missed all but the last rebel base.</p><p>We repaired PILGRED early, and Gioele had the coffee skill, so with the coffee machine giving coffee every cycle Gioele had a <strong>lot</strong> of APs.</p><p>I built the sofa in the Alpha Bay because I didn't know it could be moved. It wasn't that bad, because at first we had an inactive comms officer so a bridge sofa wouldn't be very useful, and later we realized with no researchers Eleesha could have the medlab bed anyway. We built and dismantled the Lizaro Jungle, and built a second sofa in the Refectory for coffee-Gioele.</p><p>Hua and Kuan Ti both did some things but eventually died of inactivity. At the end everything started breaking or catching on fire, and Raluca, Eleesha, and Janice all ended up running out of morale. The other 6 of us returned to Sol!</p><p>I'm probably not remembering everything interesting.</p>

Aside from being chosen as Mush on active ship that is. Everybody was spending 90% of the first day in dorms so spiking was bit problematic. Our only possible target was Chao napping in one of the turrets. I was working on anti-spore and delaying the finish to get him converted before that. Unfortunately Frieda misclicked and instead of spiking him spored for the second twice in front of Chao. So yeah her cover was blown at it was just a matter of time before she was killed so we decided she should at least take Chun with her. Didn't work so well. I finished Chao-mushification next day. I'm really sorry for him, but i couldn't just let these two spores go to waste. As i was only level 2 mush without xp i was kinda short on options at the time and the fact that ship seemed VERY organized at this point i decided to just go trigger-happy and start hiding useful stuff. Unfortunately Chun was either undercover cyborg or zombie. One shot from lizaro,grenade,around three punches and still standing. Popped the spore and finally finshed her but didn't have enough ap to resist Gioele and Stephen making a punching bag out of me haha.</p><p>Going slow would probably be more damaging but i was so paranoid at that point that i thought i will be dead as soon as i do anything mushy.</p>

                <p>Terrence here.</p><p>My best ship so far (though it doesn't say that much). A mix of those who were late for the MMM jump and random people. Four went completely inactive and some had decreasing activity, but we kept the ship flying fairly well. Morale (and neither hull nor oxygen) forced us to return to Sol earlier than we would have liked.</p><p>MVP: Gioele. You can drink the coffee on my ships anytime.</p><p>I think Jin Su did better than the average player. Not perfect, but blaming him solely for the lack of morale is unfair.</p><p>Ian, Roland, Janice, and Raluca, it was nice to play with you.</p><p>Eleesha and Stephen started well, but their activity dropped as the game progressed.</p><p>We had two sofas. Ian "decided" to build the first in Alpha Bay. I was - let's say - sceptical at first, but given that Paola was useless (and took a long time in going inactive), it wouldn't have been much good on the bridge anyway and with the number of active players we had, Raluca should have a place to sleep. Having her in Alpha Bay saved me a lot of MP. I ended up being fairly happy with that sofa.<br>Second sofa was (intentionally) placed in the Refectory so Gioele didn't have to walk to get coffee.</p><p>It took me 1 Mech point and 18 AP to dismantle the Lizaro Jungle. I got the percentage up to 68 %. I was ready at cycle change when I would get the AP to make the 7th attempt. I clicked the Lizaro, clicked dismantle, confirmed and in the same seconds Finola awoke, grabbed the Lizaro and ran out to kill Chun. The same Finola that I had just argued shouldn't be killed because Chao was more suspicious. Not my brightest moment...</p><p>At least Chao was also Mush (and also killed within the next hour). <br>Thanks to the Mush for killing an inactive Chun instead of taking out someone active.</p><p>We ended up orbiting a planet with two intelligent life sectors and one cristalite sector (and an oxygen sector as well, I think), but we never got to explore it due to the deaths. Too bad as we had both a diplomat and the babel module.</p>

                <p>Yeah, definitely wasn't trying to say it was solely his fault. If Janice had come back online she could have eaten bananas and probably survived until he returned for speeches. Both offline at the same time is what did us in for reaching Day 15, and it was way too early in the morning for me and too sad about not hitting day 15 when I made that first post, so I apologize if it was too harsh. My last words were in character, grief/rage/etc - I truly don't feel that you were useless, Jokie/Jin, hope it didn't come across that way! Was so sad to get so close! But still a good run, and very satisfying given that we did have issues with activity and such. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Really wish Stephen had been able to be more active. I identified who he was early on and was terribly excited at the beginning to have another ship with him. But life stuffs come first, and rightly so. Maybe down the line when he's less busy.</p><p>Edit: Oh! I just remembered, I can finally post Gioele's song in forums now. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Chao here, not being able to be a part of this ship got increasingly more disheartening after finishing another ship which lasted almost 5 days and then getting past 5 days on the next ship(current ship) and this one STILL hadn't gone in my profile (thus hadn't finished).</p><p>I wish I hadn't left myself in the turret unguarded before I went to bed, but I was out of movement points. Gah. I also couldn't get on before day change to save myself, alas. (Seriously, if I had gotten on just a little sooner... Actually it might have just taken 10 minutes sooner if I recall correctly...)</p><p>Oh, and Terrence, in regards to the scooter, I had picked it up when running around the ship cataloging things on astropad, I was going to give it to you (since it's most useful to you), but then I became mush before I was able to see you ask about it(I don't remember if you asked while I was asleep before being mushified)... And I was kinda like... Well, darn, now what? <br>Even as a mush I amounted to nothing, since all I actually did was hide the scooter and hacker kit which were found not long after. lol</p>

Well I'll extinguish this fire too and go back to bed." <br>Doing those actions were taking around 10/15 mins because of my laptop who's god damn slow. I was kinda disappointed to not have the occasion to share more of my time with you guys, specially with Rain which I've already played with and I was very happy at first to find out that we were on the same ship. But well..</p><p>It has been an amazing journey anyway, you guys were super nice to play with.</p>
