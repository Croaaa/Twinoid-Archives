                <p>Hello everyone Andie here from this Mission: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3911" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3911</a></p><br><p>I just wanna say how fun it was to get to play a winning ship this time around. I especially want to thank everyone who was on and active, since we only had two inactives the whole time and our Mush were caught day 1.</p><p>The ship was really nice on the roleplay side of things for the first few days, but then as we started to debate and argue about Eden and how to get there, it just kinda fell to the wayside, which I suppose is understandable. it's hard to stay in character when you need to coordinate actions between players and match active times.</p><p>It was kind of funny how everyone kept insist my version of Andie was girl even though he went on the record numerous times trying to get everyone to call him a man. He even slept with Janice at the end there to prove his gender.</p><br><p>Though now as I reach the end of this I find I want to give some shout outs as well to my fellow crew members.</p><p><strong>Kuan:</strong> I know you and I argued a lot, but I don't have anything against your Dream to Eden, I wanted it to, and I just wanted us to get there safety without sacrificing our pretty active crew. I hope I didn't make you too upset or anything.</p><p><strong>Jin Su/Terrance:</strong> I want to thank you for your guidance at the beginning and the encouraging roleplay. It was really awesome.</p><p><strong>Chun:</strong> I want to say thank you the most, you were an excellent research buddy and you helped keep me calm when I was paranoid about Kuan and Stephen being infected from the possible infected cat.</p><p><strong>Everyone else,</strong> I want to say thank you as well for all the hard work and I hope you had as much as a good time as I did on this ship, I hope I get to see some of you again later on.</p>

                <p>Jin/Terrence here: Thanks for being so passionate, all the crew who believed in the dream but weren't so blind to push recklessly at the cost of our fellow shipmates.</p><p>If Mushy-Terrence ever comes on to check-in I'd like to hear his half of the story. I had you nearly pinned as the 2nd mush after Ian's actions were indefensibly bad (especially as a gold, at least pretend you're bronze by not picking up all your skills if possible next time, Ian). Would've been able to keep my body too if you didn't decide to jump the gun and snatch me. <strong>I do suppose I should thank you for boosting my glory to current No.1 of the season by a margin of (at time of posting) 32 points</strong> "Cocky"? Maybe a bit, but what's a captain without a little boisterous swagger?<br>By the way, if you had tried to hide your transfer in a bronze body you might been able to actually fool us instead of just taking a patrolship, a hydropot and my body as your <em>final spit in our eye</em></p><p>Would've loved if our Ral had Genius so we could have cured Ian (who might've been able to pick up green thumb) and just left you behind, but things don't always work out perfectly in rando-ships.</p><p>To Gioele: Thanks for being available to captain as your schedule allowed. Nobody is awake 24/7 and it can be a pressure boiler when there are outside factors that prevent the captain from logging on more than 3-4 cycles. I would've been in the same pickle too if I had kept my title! (I had a huge final exam just 5-6 days ago). After the mush hunt is completed it's all about transparency and communication (even if it breaks RP environment a little), if the captainship is thrust upon you again in a future ship, then it's definitely a good idea to let the crew know a rough estimate of your daily login pattern and which logins are most reliably counted on.</p><p>To Andie, Frieda, Hua, and the rest of the exploration crew: We had Eden stolen from us by bad RNG <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> If there's a lesson for your future ships that look like they have Eden potential it's probably this: make sure you vote and explain why <strong>Quantum sensors</strong> can supercharge the scanning efficiency in your Neron threads, and 2) make sure your Polyvalent/Diplomat reveals his/her regular cycle schedule post-mush so that simple, safe planet visits don't take 2 days because of scheduling issues. 3) <strong>BIG BOLD LETTERS TO REMIND PEOPLE TO WEAR SPACE SUITS</strong> oh... and remember not to trash your planets if they have potential! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I'm Chun, aka the newbie who hopefully didn't mess up during the course of this amazing game.</p><p>I want to thank you guys for being an wonderful crew, especially since it was my first time around playing Mush. Even with no other experience with the game, this will probably one of the best, if not the best, crew I'll ever have. Everyone was always active, excluding the two people we never saw much of anyway, and they always contributed so much effort and was as efficient as can be for this ship. On the RP side of things, I can't really comment - what I saw was fun, even if I still don't have much clue as to everybody's characters (well, Andie, you still kept it alive when you could too and that was awesome).</p><p>All in all, I was spoiled for what should be a first timer's game, and even though we didn't make it to Eden because of our unlucky RNG, it was great time and I'm glad we could win.</p><p>To Andie - Thank you so, so much for guiding and helping me, and for being my research-buddy as well. I wouldn't have been half as efficient or clueless if not for you, and you were the one constant person I trusted in throughout the whole game, from beginning to end. It helped me settle my nerves of being a new player. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>To all of the crew - Just one last thank you for everything. I hope that you guys all find other games with a crew as great as this, and that we'll maybe meet again in another game.</p>

                <p>Original Terrence here checking in on how things turned out. Sounds like it was a fun ship which I sort of figured it would have been.</p><p>It's been a while, but I'll try to piece together what the mush side was like in the early game. When the ship filled up and the mush were selected I came online to see posts about how Ian was dirty standing in the hallways like a lemon. I don't think Ian has been a mush before or at least seen much successful mush play. He had taken <strong>all</strong> of his skills at once including Anonymush leaving no real room for on the fly strategy. His suggestions in the mush channel on how to bring down the ship was to let the plants die and hide the hydropots, which are huge red flags on an even slightly active ship. After a bit of deliberation it became very clear that Ian wasn't going to be able to hold a cover for more then a day or two if he was lucky and with so many gold members on the ship it was going to be highly active. With this I told Ian to clean up, stop painting 'Die humans' on the wall in the Rear Corridor, and head to bed. I explained to Ian that the best course of action was to keep his head down while I got a spore, switched with Jin Su, &amp; took the hacker kit. I will cover the entirety of the plan in more detail later in this post because I didn't bother telling Ian all of it or more accurately the intentions behind it.</p><p>I logged in later on to see Gioele asking Ian why he was hurt. For those who don't know, a mush will take damage from showering and the medkit is often used to check to see if someone is damaged. I assume Gioele investigated around the ship looking for room shakes and steel plating to explain Ian's damage. Giving him barely two cycles to respond Gioele &amp; Stephen? started assaulting him. Ian didn't even log in for another 3-4 cycles after that assault started and sadly he was deaf due to a damaged ear. I couldn't coordinate with him and he couldn't even defend himself in chat due to Gioele's hasty action. What I am saying is Gioele got lucky, I've seen so many useful crew members die on other ships with more conclusive evidence then what Gioele presented. For future reference to everyone since some people on the ship seemed to agree Gioele or at least didn't contest that <strong>personal damage</strong> isn't recorded in room logs. Just because someone is hurt isn't concrete enough evidence that they are mush. Considering Ian's job is to tend to plants which involves a lot of picking up items and interacting it's not uncommon to take random personal damage. That all aside I'm not really shocked that Ian was targeted right away for his sloppy play.</p><p>Once Gioele announced his attack on Ian I decided to chime in with the point I stated above about how that alone wasn't enough evidence. I knew Ian was dead but figured he at least deserved the chance to either berserk or plead his case. I logged off for the night to consider my options in the morning. The next morning I was shocked to see Ian still alive and he informed me of his hearing loss in private chat. At this point I figured I would just blitz with my plan anyway and Ian could just wonder around without a clue. I picked up the unguarded Grenade and Grenade blueprint and proceeded to Bravo Dorm to kill Chun. At this point I assumed she had the Hacker Kit on her which is the only real reason she needed to die. After throwing two grenades and using all but the 1 AP needed to spore/transfer to Jin Su she was not dead. I moved up to the bridge, took Jin Su's body which had a good amount of AP/MP. I was very disappointed that he didn't have a weapon on him but nevertheless I returned to the dorm to use all but 1 AP again trying to kill Chun. Now at this point I knew that my gamble didn't pay off. I left for Bravo Bay and took off in a partol ship while watching everyone wake up to see what had happened. I did a bit of RP with Gioele which was fun and then you guys did some last minute one liners and left me in space.</p><p>Considering the fact that Ian was pretty much under the spotlight from the start and I was only a bronze player I needed to come up with a plan to combat such an active ship. I could berserk and kill people, hide items, steal the Pasiphae, or lay low and wait for deaths from paranoia. To the crew's credit I didn't think any of these would really work and I wanted to do something unexpected or at least with my own twist. The plan was to obtain the hacker kit, and the commander's body to paralyze the ship. Once this was done I would hold the ship ransom to buy time and keep it alive. I would move the ship if we found a planet for O2 and use the extra time to have Ian who hopefully wasn't dead infect in secret or I would spore near day changes to rush convert crew members. I wanted to get a foot hold in the crew with mush and attempt an Eden mush victory. Once I had the hacker kit and the commander's body I would leave it up to the crew if they wanted to die out, keep trying to find a way to kill the mush, or submit to mush dominance. It would have been fun from a challenge and RP perspective. Would most of the crew just go inactive and give up? Would you schedule guard duties? It would have been fun to see how long we could go with such a setup.</p><p>So why did the mush lose? Bad coordination, some inexperience, active attentive crew, and a bit of bad RNG. I don't care if Chun had the armor, she still got pretty lucky from not dying from two grenades &amp; a lot of punches.</p><p><strong>To Jin Su</strong> - I hope contesting the killing of a valuable member of the crew on shaky evidence wouldn't have lead to my death as well. Also I mentioned in my final words that I felt you were a bit cocky because you were making assumptions about incompetence on my part. Assuming I was trying to blend in or didn't know how the transfer skill worked. I <strong>did</strong> forget to close the chat window with Ian, but really in the grand scheme of things if I got the hacker kit it wouldn't have mattered.</p><p><strong>To Gioele</strong> - In my post above I was a bit hard on you for your actions only because I've seen quite a few chao's kill without consulting anyone or because they had 'indisputable' evidence. I would have defended anyone for getting killed for those reason even playing as a mush.</p><p><strong>To Chun</strong> - I honestly wished you didn't pick up the hacker kit so I didn't have to waste AP trying to kill you. Also I did feel bad about trying to kill you early on in your first ship. How much HP did you have after all that?</p><p><strong>To Everyone</strong> - I would have enjoyed not rolling mush for this ship, but someone has to play the antagonist. Sorry the mush hunt wasn't super interesting this time but now you know my reasoning and what was happening on the mush side.</p>

                <p>Hey Terrence, if your intent was to get onto a ship with the hacker kit to keep the human crew stranded.. well, then it would be your inexperience with mush that would've caused the mush team's considerable ineffectiveness. The <strong>Hacker Kit</strong> cannot be brought outside the ship via Patrol or Pasiphae or whatever. As distasteful as it may have been, making a more considerable effort to kill Chun with Berzerking would've probably been more effective.</p><p>If the intent was to, instead, just follow Ian around using him as a human shield, then I'm fairly sure that 10+ humans all focused on the task of eliminating Ian and my Old body would've worked just as well.</p>

                <p>I will say I am glad to hear that the Hacker Kit can't be taken off the ship since most people would abuse it in a less fun way. I figured there would have been a way to counter it in some fashion. It's not something you attempt unless you are mush or really bother to look up.</p><p>Playing to just win isn't the way I like to enjoy mush so I would not just rush Chun only to kill her. That is a very boring way to play along with killing crew then hiding behind Ian. That being said sitting around the ship and doing nothing mushy is boring, too. It's a hard balance trying to have a fun ship without falling back on the kill key crew strategy. Who knows how the ship might have turned out if I knew about the Hacker Kit. I probably would have been around to see day 6 or 7. Just wanted to explain the situation in it's entirety.</p>
