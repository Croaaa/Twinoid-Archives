                <p>Yep! Eleesha here; just put in my <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/776">final words</a>. I'm surprised that we got so far with such a small crew! I guess we should thank Jin Su for the missions he issued and the hunters he killed while trying to disguise himself, eh? ;P <br>It's funny how you guys blew up Alpha Dorm yet it was Finola on the other side of the ship! I'm glad Paola got to make it back, I'm sure her morale was at 0 after that. If you find us Raluca, I'm going to play Raluca next game in your honor. We did some insane teamwork finishing Pilgred and a few of those projects towards the end there!</p><p>And then there's Chun. I don't think her lack of understanding anything we were saying particularly hurt us, but you have to wonder what's going on in her merry little world while she's prancing around the ship without a care in the galaxy while we're blowing dorms up and stabbing inactive people to find the last alpha mush. I like how she advanced all the researches one step long after we decided to not even use the laboratory <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This was certainly an interesting ship for a less than half active crew, the active ones really made up for it and made it worthwhile!</p>

                <p>Random stats:<br>Explorations: 0 - what do you need those for?<br>Research: 0 - ditto<br>Rebel bases contacted: 1 - Wolf of course. We really needed that glory.<br>Number of non-Mush pilots: 1 (Terrence)<br>Number of times Terrence left the Daedalus to pilot anything: 0</p><p>The four who returned:<br>Eleesha [Observant, Technician] - the Technician part quite reveals that we have a very experienced player here. Very active, helpful and brillant. <br>Kuan Ti - new player, but did really well. We wouldn't have made it without you. And you both got to be the commander who brought us home and won the glory ranking as you wanted to. <br>Terrence [Robotics, Technician, Pilot] - this was my second game. Some minor mistakes, but it generally went well.<br>Paola - not enough communication with the rest of the crew, but it got better near the end.</p><p>Those who helped but didn't make it:<br>Raluca - never posted in the general chat, but we got some project cooperation going in private. Too bad you didn't warn us that your morale was that low.<br>Stephen - our replacement navigator who did well until he was converted to mush on day 4 - and then killed before he got online to do anything.</p><p>The bad guys:<br>Jin Su - only active Mush. Managed a conversion, but was identified by the movement logs (and particularly the lack of movement of anyone else at the time). Thanks for the scrap that got useful for drones, even though you took your time to bring it in.<br>Finola - inactive Mush. Finally got killed when we had murdered our way through all the other inactives.</p><p>The weird:<br>Chun - some movement and occasional random work, but no communication of any kind.</p><p>The inactive:<br>Janice - appeared two times, the second somewhat annoying as it lost me the Neron Admin title, but it did help our morale when she left the Engine Room and moved to Alpha Dorm. <br>Hua [Botanist] - said something like "don't criticize my plant work. I got this", started the botanist job well, then completely disappeared. <br>Chao, Gioele, Roland - the Alpha Dorm bunch who were the reason for the double grenade attack. It turned out that they were all human, but I'll still claim that it was a good idea.<br>Frieda, Ian - well, at least you died from morale loss at a convenient time.</p>

                <p>Rofl! I forgot about Hua, hahahaha! Yeah after that comment I banked on her just keeping to herself tending to them, so much for that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Janice's timing definitely sucked. I hope Paola's learned from us to be more communicative on her future ships. And it's pretty cool that Kuan Ti got to shine so well as such a fresh new player. Our work's done, eh? While he gets all the money and women back at home, I'll be pushing you around room to room every time dinner's ready.</p>
