                <p><strong><em>Hey guys;</em></strong><br>Finished a voyage today on Day 6, we returned to Sol.<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2451" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2451</a></p><p>I am genuinely surprised that people even survived.<br>From early on, it was clear that over 50% of the crew was inactive or weren't working with the rest of the crew, and doing their own thing. Despite this, we managed to find and kill both Mush by the start of Day 2, even though one of them was inactive.</p><p>This was after Terrence removed both our showers, so we lynch mobbed him, and we made a lucky guess that the second Mush was Raluca.</p><p>Following this, we actually continued to keep getting lucky up until Day 6 - we got a few easy research projects done, despite an inactive and uncooperative crew, and didn't come close to death as a result of oxygen loss or shields going down.</p><p>And we only had two deaths as far as I recall - one being someone dying of morale loss, and another being Eleesha getting lost on an expedition.</p><p><strong>Never forget their sacrifice...</strong></p><p>On Day 5/6, a crew rift began to unfortunately develop - as a result of slow progress and only a sink to provide for the entire crew, I was accused of being inactive, despite being tossed around by members of the crew. I wouldn't really mind, but I really wanted to aim for Eden, but with one sink and a crew rift beginning to develop, and death threats flying, it really wasn't going to happen.</p><p>So, I returned us to Sol.</p><p>As you can see, some crew members clearly weren't happy about this - I don't think they realised what a state the entire ship was actually in.</p><p>And quite frankly, the sooner it was done, the better...</p><p>If only all voyages could be excellent, right?<br>-Adp <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I wasn't on your ship, but interested in your story. What were the death threats? Who was being threatened to be killed by whom?</p><p>Technically you guys lost I think, because y'all went back to Sol without the cure, least that's how I've heard some others measure the win (have to get back to Sol with cure and without live Mush). That might have colored some of the sadness about the return, dunno from the endpage posts.</p><p>Sounds rough without the sink! I don't think I'd have tried for Eden specifically, but maybe taken it one challenge at a time and pushed for whatever fun and success actually came.

                <p>Terrence/fearpils, the lack of showers certainly made the voyage more... enjoyable? We all had to wash in the sink, and had arguments about the soap.</p><p>Impet - our Frieda, Chun and Kuan threatened to kill me for not moving the ship in the exact hour they wanted, and throughout the journey, whenever someone didn't wash for more than a few hours, they came close to being lynched for it.</p><p>Tensions ran preeetty high.</p><p>And yeah - we didn't completely lose, because the Mush were eliminated, but the cure would've yielded more glory. Honestly, I reckon we would've killed each other or screwed up before that, unfortunately - we were working on anti Mush projects despite the Mush being dead.</p><p>And yeah, Eden seems to come to ships which are just doing really well. When everyone is friendly and wants to work together, and the Mush are eliminated early, I wouldn't put it past even a novice ship to not find Eden. It's a reward that comes to those who work together <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
