Cold hands and when my eyes opened, all I felt was hunger.. I was one of <strong>The Many.. The Mush.</strong></em></span></span><br>My story began there, alongside Jin Su, commander. A deadly duo. We were planning havok until the rest of the crew, leading an undercover investigation, took out Jin. I was alone to fufill my cause.. With every moment leading me closer into a corner, I decided to go out in a blast, converting Derek (Sorry.) in the presence of the other crew. I closed my eyes and embraced death, only to <em>truly</em> wake up.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">This was very early on in the game, and the research team had secretly been working on the <strong>Cure</strong></span></p><p><em><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><strong>My eyes opened and I felt mortal again. To my astonishment, instead of being lynched I was.. Saved?</strong></span></span></em></p><p>This was but one of the many accomplishments of this truly gifted crew. I'm bragging, I know, but I have every right to. It goes without saying we made it to Eden- actually, we obtained all of the starmap pieces and Calculator by Day 8 if I'm not mistaken. Just to further express our abilities, we finished all projects and all researches by Day 10/11. <br>I've personally never had the luck of such an active and professional group before, but that's just me. It was an honor playing with all of you folks! Hope to see you in a next game! (Needless to say, I'll be adding all of you.)</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Special thanks to Paola who was generous in giving me a Gold pass ticket. Without that, I wouldn't have been as useful as I was. Thank you. Another thank you will go to JANICE WHO WE WILL NEVER FORGET! She passed away during an expo we did for the fun of it, a few cycles before going to Eden. May she realize that good she did for the ship and crew and that she played a key part in keeping everyone alive.</span></p><p>Raluca <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> and Schrodinger <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico"> , <em><strong>signing out.<br></strong></em></p>

                <p>Well, that's good!</p><p>I was Chun and spearheaded most of the research. The crew participation in getting the Cure ready in just a few hours was incredible. I've never seen such activity.</p><p>With my Medic / Nurse skills and the healing pomade, I was healing 6HP per heal with free points. It was basically the best thing ever.</p><p>I've also never seen a ship get everything done so soon!

                <p>Hell yeah you were, Chun! I remember at one point, each time I logged back on, there would be an additional research that was finished. Initially as Mush, you could imagine my reaction.. Jin Su and I were planning something big, a mass killing of sorts, but after he had been taken out.. I felt really bad to attack, so I just converted Derek. He's probably pissed off, and I don't blame him. It was an a-hole move on my part <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"> <br>Honestly, I didn't even notice Stephen and Hua's death..

                <p>Terrence here, great fun on this ship. Went to bed one night to wake up and find Eleesha and Gioele went on a murderous streak with what appeared as mushy activity but nothing concrete, sorry you died Stephen and Hua. It did make a buttload of us sick and helped us in our mush investigation.</p><p>Jin, Raluca, and Kaun were our last three major suspects. Jin didn't spend any ap on anything, slept in beds all day, never gave out missions, never gave speeches, and spent too much time in Bravo dorm. He dug his grave when I told the group that a mush Jin will avoid searching for scrap or do a shitty job. <span class="tid_wspoil">He came back with one plastic piece.</span></p><p>Raluca was suspect by being dirty since day one and never working on Neron...then I medkit checked her and knew she was one. We killed Jin and had an elaborate plan to guard IB and the Engine room until the Serum was finished......instead we just tried rushing the serum full force. Again I went to bed with the plan being to stick Raluca when it was done and make up lies (fake lists, calling out Kuan, ect.) on the main threads so Raluca wouldn't go rampaging on us.</p><p>Apparently this was misunderstood, and I woke up to find the serum being done for 7 hours and sitting in the lab. I ran to the lab, only to find Paola(Sstrickl) had grabbed it. Went to Alpha dorm cuz Janice was freaking out and saw Raluca spike Derek. Paola quickly stuck Raluca....but it was too late. Derek had been turned with that last spike and we had to eliminate him and his awesome role play. If only I had woken up 15 minutes earlier.</p><p>After that the ship went on cruise control and we got Pilgerd, starmaps, research, projects, drones with 12 inch vibrating self lubricating rods....the usual stuff.</p><p>We did have one more tragedy, poor Janice was taken from us too soon. I've never seen a planet attack some1 for over 10. Great ship great crew.</p>

No single person was noobish or inactive - imagine that we have also Stephen and Hua with us as well... My deep apologies to you two. <em>Stephen</em>, in case you will be reading it, I am still dreaming about your bacon sandwich, really! I did not manage to taste fresh steak, I was on banana diet <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> <em>Hua</em>, very unfortunate lame way to loose gold player like that, but why did you go to AB2 and back without saying anything? You must new that's top suspicious thing you could do at that time... Eleesha wanted to act fast, me, Gioele and Derek have supported her - to do an epic mistake. I am really sorry!<br><br>Kudos to <em>Eleesha</em> that she did not gave up the game and continue with the hunt. Lucky (erhmm), because of two deaths - one in each dorm - we had a lot of people of psychological illnesses or gastro, so you could together with Chun build pro-team. I was too hasty with clearing the names and curing people's heads, but what should good human psychologist do, riiight? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I was suspecting <em>Jin Su</em> as well, he was active EACH time something happened and was not helping us at all - and he got the bed all the time (unusual). So no my dear, it was not a random kill - your obvious scooter bully that I should drop it "anywhere" to trap rooms, bah! Anyway, looks like you was succesfull, poor Derek caught two spores. The second name was unclear to me for quite a long time, but I was wondering why Raluca is avoiding to join us to help and when I was invited to secret channel, it became all clear and helped to rush the CURE!<br><br>People were disappointed we have lost <em>Derek</em>, our Mr. Awesome - I felt guilty as well, wish he was online as usual but he was inactive already at time we have finished Mycoscanner as well. He would know he is at two spores already and Ian could remove them... I was so scared when I spotted that big red message in Dorm, I was 99.9% sure Raluca did transfer to his body and kill me and others with all those APs! Paola was quick, I was only in BB reporting what happened and she was already curing Raluca, her words "<em></em><strong></strong>taken care of ... or not<strong></strong><em></em>" were remarkable before we found out what really happened <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"><br><br>The next day, Pilgred was finished like nothing. <em>Raluca</em> has become another valuable crew member, so we were glad she is with us. We already had one starmap fragment from our first expedition, so we had big plans for Eden. All were excellent with their jobs! <em>Paola</em> stuffed by coffees and rations finished all the Comms (waiting only for last rebel base) at day <strong>6</strong>! <em>Ian</em> was very precise with timing for his beloved trees and research and helped us to find the mysterious jumpkin - shame he could not enjoy his boosted Garden (with heat lamps and incubator) for more. <em>Frieda</em>, our mankarog lover, valuable IT expert and Pilot in one body - who passed planet scans to <em>Gioele</em>, our smiley Commander skilled both in Astro and Biology (ohh the mighty coffee can do wonders!). <em>Roland</em> our fearsome hunter (and trader ship) killer who always made my mood better, Yaaarrr! <em>Chun</em> - our sexy lady with awesome healing powers, always at right place at right time - same as Eleesha, who has managed a lot of fires and relays! <em>Terrence</em> browsing the ship with his wheels and sense of humour, true soul for Tech and drones stuff and skilled with maneuvering outside when more scrap was needed! Cannot forget <em>Andie</em>, helpful in many ways like man with all his capabilities can be - and <em>Kuan Ti</em> who was sleeping often anywhere he was forgotten in but still with us and relaying in his favorite Nexus or Lab.<br><br>Big <strong>THANK YOU</strong> all, it was great journey and see ya soon on next ship I hope! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
