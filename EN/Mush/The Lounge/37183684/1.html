Thought I'd post it here so you wouldn't lose it.</p><p>On our first expedition down, it was you, Hua, and me (Ian.) Just the three of us, if I recall; "Ian, drop the compass - I don't want Hua to get lost," you said. I dropped it, but she must not have seen, because then, before we knew it, she was gone. We never found her again, not really - just her body. But she didn't seem like her anymore when she wasn't alive.</p><p>"I wish I had told her how I felt," I said.</p><p>"She knew how I felt. I made sure of that," you replied.</p><p>We talked:</p><p><cite>Roland : Dead. Yeah. Should have waited. 4d<br><br>Roland : Yeah, I mean--no, you're right. My fault. She was out of it, I should have waited for her to pick it up, but I didn't and now she's... 4d<br><br>Ian : I'm sorry. I know there's no replacing someone like that. She was an amazing person. 4d<br><br><br>Ian : I did drop it for her. But I didn't say anything, I just thought she would see. I should have said something... 4d<br><br>Roland : Sorry. I don't...shouldn't blame you for anything. Everything's just kind of shaky and uprooted right now. 4d<br><br>Roland : And you had the compass, and if you dropped it earlier she might... she might've... <br><br>Roland : And we were...co-piloting together once, and I screwed up her ship with a big idiotic manoeuvre, and she forgave me. Nobody's done that. They ignored me and moved on but she stuck around. 4d<br><br>Roland : She was the best damn pilot I ever knew and she put up with me. Which is a miracle all in itself, y'know. Mostly I just bug people until it's funny, and as a rule people don't like that, which is fine, y'know, I'm fine with that. But she stuck around and she listened. 4d<br><br>Ian : ... We both had a love of plants, and I liked the way she laughed. That was all. But she was a pilot, and they're always so busy, you know, and I'm quite content to stay in one place, so I never thought to pursue it. What about you? 4d<br><br>Roland : What...how did you feel about her?</cite></p><p>(Part 1)</p>

I'm feeling kind of...kind of sick, to be honest. ~3d</p><p>Roland : I told her about the compass, I said she shouldn't--shouldn't be getting lost and it still... ~3d<br><br>Roland : ...I told her about the compass. ~3d<br><br>Roland : It's a lot to take in. It's an incredible amount of stuff to take in. But if I tread water long enough, maybe I can hack it until the shock numbs. ~3d<br><br>Roland : Shouldn't have happened. Especially shouldn't have happened like it did. She was an expedition ace and this is just... ~3d<br><br>Roland : We were just...comfortable around each other. Takes a lot of time to build that up. And now she's gone and that's so pointless. ~3d<br><br>Roland : Yeah...we used to have these long, pointless, stupid talks whenever we got the opportunity to co-pilot. Don't know exactly why, but she was really open with me. Just talking for hours about whatever. There'll be other co-pilots, and I'm sure they're just as good, but you can't fill the space she's leaving. There's gonna be silence. ~3d<br><br>Ian : ... Janice would probably say that we're bargaining. She would say that it's good, that we need to get the feelings out, that from here it's just depression and acceptance. But she's still not going to be there. Life will go on, I hope - there will be other planets, other expeditions - but I just can't stop myself thinking, "I bet she would have liked that," or stupid things like "I should save some cuttings of this for when we get back to Hua." But then I realize she's not waiting for us somewhere, she's not lost, she's not back on Sol. She's just gone. ~3d</p></cite><p>(Part 2)</p>

                <cite><p>Roland : ... Anemole juice, huh. I'd like that. I think. Not sure, actually, since you're the one with education in the subject- but sure, I can give it a try. ~2d</p><p>Roland : ... Provided I understood them. Sorry. Ground-based stuff isn't really my strong suit. ~2d</p><p>Roland : Well, there wasn't much else to focus on down on the surface. No chance of nodding off either unless I wanted to wake up to a faceful of centipedes. It was nice to hear your, uh...lectures is usually rude, but I guess it's the right word in this case--I mean, it seems you're really on to some winners with those papers. Sounded like that to me, going by the parts of them I understood. ~2d<br><br>Ian : You were paying attention, Roland! I'm impressed! Most people begin nodding off by now... You're quite correct, the research data I'd be collecting would be very similar, but that's just how academia works these days - you've got to squeeze every drop of potential from the data that you can! Speaking of which, would you like to try some anemole juice? It's very, um. Unique! ~2d<br><br>Roland : You're, uh, you're very prolific, Professor Soulton. Real impressive. ~2d<br><br>Roland : ...or...that third one you mentioned. About something else which I can't really recall at the moment. ~2d<br><br>Roland : Sounds...great. Wait, but isn't that a bit much like the other one you mentioned down on the surface? Or was that one about, uh...hang on, I'm thinking...the shifting frequency of floral mutation when exposed to light on different wavelengths of the color spectrum? ~2d<br><br>Ian : Why, thank you! While they aren't very useful for our voyage currently, if we ever return to Earth, I think some of these could be fascinating examples of xenofloral photosynthetic hue variation based on solar distance and atmospheric composition! I think I'll call the paper "Another sun's rainbow!" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Catchy, right? ~2d<br><br>Roland : Oh, thank god for- uh, shame, I mean. I really enjoy the technical bits of your lectures. ~2d<br><br>Ian : Don't worry, I abbreviated the interesting bits! ~2d<br><br>Roland : Looking forward to that report. Can't wait to hear more about stamens and pistills and...that stuff, yeah. ~2d<br><br>Ian : Beautiful and fascinating though these are, I'm afraid they're not much better than our banana trees. The Frageline cures Acid Reflux, and the anemole /might/ cure tapeworm 35 percent of the time, but otherwise, these fruits are simply more filling than bananas, and only sometimes tastier. I'll write up a report in a tic. ~2d<br><br>Roland : Well. Not a bad haul, that. Find anything you like? ~3d<br><br>Roland : Just grab the spacesuit and you should be set. It'd be nice if you could give me a heal as well. ~3d<br><br>Roland : Well, heroes are...it's a tough question. We can talk about it later. ~3d<br><br>Ian : *? ~3d<br><br>Ian : Oh - right, I'll be right there. Anything I should pick up along the way. ~3d<br><br>Ian : In the face of the odds we're going up against... how can we not be? ~3d<br><br>Roland : You coming with on the expedition? Frieda and Gio are here, but I want everyone we can get. We need to keep an eye on each other. ~3d</p></cite><p>(Part 3)</p>

                <p><cite>Roland : I'm just gonna drop my trackie for a while to cart fuel. A re-invite will be treated as permanent permission to gab your ear off, alright? ~1d<br><br>Roland : Aw, well. Thanks. Pushing a few bogeys off us isn't a lot compared to keeping us breathing. Thanks for that, by the way. ~1d<br><br>Roland : Yeah, I mean- it blows my mind that people didn't seem to notice her, you know? I worked with her for a while. Saw her fight Gs that'd have top cadets scraping their brains off the ceiling. Casually lead folks on expedition away from disaster. She's singlehandedly held ships together at the seams without ever getting so much as a thank you, and she never even seemed to mind. Frustrated the hell out of me. ~1d<br><br>Ian : You, too. All you'd have to do is not do your job and the ship would fall apart. You're literally keeping us together. ~1d<br><br>Ian : Sigh. I know. She really understood the /art/ of it, too. That it's not about food production or making prize winners for a competition or anything so silly as that. That it's about caring, about working with another, utterly different form of life and forging a harmonious working relationship. I think a lot of people underestimated her because she wasn't, well, she wasn't Janice Kent. But she didn't have to be. All she had to do to be extraordinary was be Hua... ~1d<br><br>Roland : You'd have had an unfair advantage, though. Nerve-wracking to think of all that fungal knowledge falling into the wrong hands. ~1d<br><br>Roland : Yeah, no, of course! Sentiments echoed loud and clear. I didn't suspect you- I mean, I didn't suspect you more than I would have anyone else, but you hear all these horror stories about it being undetectable and you never know, you know? ~1d<br><br>Roland : Yeah, she kind of...that's how I could keep up with some of your jargon. Usually I did most of the talking, but turn the conversation around to offshoot breeds or proper soil makeup or whatever sample she'd snatched up on her latest expedition...oh man, she could go on for days. Never got tired of hearing it. ~1d<br><br>Ian : ... In other news, I can't tell you how relieved I am that you're not Mush. I've just been coping by trying to think of it as academic, theoretical, rather than real. If you had been... ~1d<br><br>Ian : No, I like hearing about it. I've never really thought about it before, and it's exciting to imagine. After all the plant lectures, you should have a chance to talk shop, too. It's good to be able to talk to someone about what you care about. I used to... well. You know. No more botany lovers to talk to on board, anyway. So the least I could do is try to understand piloting. ~1d<br><br>Roland : ...Sorry, forgot I wasn't- I shouldn't be talking shop. Gets a bit confusing. ~2d<br><br>Roland : But the hunters...aw, that's nothing special. They're rank amateurs, through and through. Don't break formation, don't think for themselves, don't seem to communicate with their partners and keep a terrible eye on their turn speed. If they manage to take a few shots at you, you just have to pull an Immelmann or a wingover- even a basic break or a stall turn will do! Jeez, that's kindergarten stuff! Get behind them and they don't know how to lose you. Embarassing, it really is. ~2d<br><br>Roland : Liquified cheeto dust in a cup? I'll drop by as soon as I can, haven't tasted that since college! Flying--well, that's just experience, I guess. Joined the air force at eighteen and I've had my head in the clouds ever since. ~2d<br><br>Ian : It reminds me of fine cabernet... if cabernet was made with cheeto dust. How did you get into flying, anyway? You've done an incredible job keeping those villains off our tails... ~2d</cite></p><p>(Part 4)</p>

                <p>Roland a quitté la discussion, gender_il left the room without a walkie talkie....<br>Roland has joined discussion.</p><p><strong>Ian:</strong> You're always welcome to it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And you can thank Hua for that, too - I couldn't have designed the garden without her.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> ...She fixed that up too? All that and still found time to get her fangs out and blast some bandits. Guess I don't have any excuse to not extend my repertoire a bit. You wouldn't happen to be teaching any botany classes at the moment, prof?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> Uh...don't know if you noticed all the hubbub going on, but something happened and we had to take action and, well. Kuan's dead. Messed up our coordinates and left us stranded in the middle of nowhere. If you want to avoid the blood, you should probably stay out of Bravo until we have a chance to clear the room.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> He...hadn't been human for a while. If that makes it any better, I mean. Don't know if it does, but it makes it more like a—like a funeral than a...well, <em>murder</em>, y'know?</p><p><strong>Ian:</strong> I would be happy to teach you anything you want to know, Roland. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> She actually a kept a binder of her notes on xenoflora to update after every expedition, which they gave to me after... well. Yes. But I think it would be right if you were to have it. I... I particularly liked the charicatures she did of you in the margins. Well, I think they're caricatures - your mouth isn't really that big in person. You're always smiling in them, though. Good smiles.</p><p><strong>Ian:</strong> Thank you for letting me know about Kuan. I didn't know him that well, but... at least he got to live to see his dream come to life. Even if we couldn't save him, we can still save his dream.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> Well, what I'd really like to know how to take care of her plants—she was real particular about them, so I don't know if you'd know the exact details of their care, but I'd like to keep them alive sort of in remembrance. Seems like the respectful thing to do.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> Ooh, that binder sounds excellent—she'd probably keep the details of that stuff in there, really specific stuff with exact nutrition needs and...and, uh. She did caricatures?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> That's really...wow. Heh. I mean, I must've--theoretically, yeah, I guess I must've known she didn't think I was a complete pest, since she went above and beyond the call of duty in putting up with me, but it's...usually I bug people. Mostly intentionally. So it sticks with me even when I'm not trying to, and sometimes I thought she just...felt the same way, but hid it better. <br><br><strong>Roland:</strong> But if she didn't, that's...a real relief to hear, honestly. I'll get those notes as soon as we get back.<br><br><strong>Ian:</strong> And little cartoons, yes. Little scribbles of you two out in your fighter ships, with giant cartoon heads sticking out. Raluca grumping in the corner and yelling at you while you fiddled with the engine. That sort of thing. I think she really liked you, considered you a close friend. She would have wanted you to have it.<br><br><strong>Roland:</strong> I—thanks. Honestly, thanks.<br> <br><strong>Roland:</strong> I'd...like to have it. If you're fine with that. Seeing her write about the stuff she loved might remind me she had a good life, and filled it with things she loved, and those things might be able to live on after her.<br><br><strong>Roland:</strong> ...Provided I remember to water them. Heh.<br><br>(Part 5)</p>

I'm playing Ian as devastated by the death, but resolved to discover the serum and get back to earth now, to save whoever is left. He knows that going back to earth with or without it is almost certain death, but he wants to be the hero for Earth that Roland was for him.</p><p>I've only rarely had roleplay with such an excellent writer, though. You were prolific whether anyone was paying attention or not, and really grabbed every opportunity. I respect and admire that - you made this into the kind of game you wanted it to be when I had sort of figured that there was little chance of encountering roleplay, so why bother. But the idea that there are players like you out there is an an /excellent/ reason to bother!</p>

                <p>Might want to snark at Frieda a bit, in that case--she's come into the main chat, upset at my death. Of course, if you don't want to, you've got reasons to ignore it as well, what with Ian's whole non-confrontationalism shtick.<br><br>As for all that...aw, <em>shucks</em>, buddy, and also right back at you. It comes naturally when playing Roland. He's a big gabby prat and that suits me just fine. Anyway, it's not like you'd resigned yourself entirely to a RP-less ship. Usually I do a little bit of roleplay whether anyone will care or not, but I got my resolve bolstered to layer it on a bit more through seeing your now-infamous apron thread. <br><br>If you want a few more examples of bothering even when there's the chance that no one's paying attention, check out Alpha Bay. I left a few flight reports on the shelves. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
