                <p>This is an AP for the first game I ended (which is to say "the first game that I clicked the 'return to Sol' button). I was playing as Ian, Chief Botanist and !!SCIENCE!!Master.</p><p>The game as a whole started reasonably well. We had a couple needless killings because people were acting really... weirdly. Not even like "this guy's a total griefer" weird, like when Stephen removed a camera, did nothing for 16 hours until I mentioned his name (as part of a list of 5 people in a dorm), then punched me in the face, walked to Alpha Bay 2, installed the camera there, and did nothing else until we killed him. Weird, right?</p><p>Anyway, after Andie died (don't actually remember if he/she was a Mush or accidentally killed), things went pretty well for a while. I settled into working on !!SCIENCE!! with the help of my lovely !!SCIENCE!!-ladies (Chun and Janice mostly, but Eleesha gets an honorable mention as well), and kept the plants going (Hua helped a lot!). Our pilots (Terrence, Hua, and the oft-inept and rarely-active Jin Su) kept our skies clear. And Derek... whined. He whined about this and that, he took the Pilot magebook because we told him to but immediately started complaining about how much he hated to shoot down hunters.</p><p>There was this long holding pattern for something like a week after that. We got two(!) starmap fragments on day 4 or so, and so we got Super Calc researched as well as RFS. So it was a situation where we were all waiting for a planet scan that might hold the last starmap fragment.</p><p>Eventually, we get a place that's worthy of debate. It's got some good zones, but most of us agreed not to go because it has Seismic, with the associated 13% chance of instant-death. Another, far less dangerous planet also came up (with ZERO percent chance of instant-death!) The crew agreed that it was good enough to visit, and we loaded up the requisite 3 fuel and eventually moved there (Jin Su was rarely active so there was a lot of waiting involved in going anywhere). Except as we all learn TOO LATE, Derek had made the executive decision to load one more fuel and move us to the planet with Seismic. We yelled at his stupidity, but organized an expo anyway.</p><p>Terrence died to the "low" 13% chance of instant-kill. The useful guy who'd been keeping hunters dead and the ship together? Nope. Dedderkins. The useless jackass who took us from a good world to a bad world? Just fine. Of course. If anyone could have spared the AP, Derek probably would have been killed on the spot with nobody feeling a twinge of guilt.</p><p>Throughout all this, Derek continues to maintain his superiority, despite having obviously just gotten someone killed needlessly. He claimed (among other things) that he'd been on "millins" [sic] of ships, and that Chao was crazy and would have done it too (despite the lack of a Chao on our ship). It was hard to tell if he was really poorly roleplaying or legitimately unable to discern fact from fiction. I suspect the entire active crew was inches from reporting him at any given moment; this child was that annoying. Quite possible that one or two people did report him, and I feel they were right to do so. <br><br>So after that we were left with even more hunters, up to 23 hovering around us, fires breaking out left and right (one cycle-change brought with it FIVE FIRES), plus equipment damage. I proposed moving the ship back to Sol and it received something like four votes for with zero votes against (technically that meant six abstentions, but we wont count Derek so at most five people could have been against it). <br><br>There was some talk of trying one more planet, but without a cristalite zone and the good chance of reaching Eden that promised, or an active enough crew to quickly move the ship, perform an expo, then move again (20 hunters, remember!), there was virtually zero chance of that ending significantly better than a cut-and-run, so I grabbed the hackerkit and took us home, with The Cure.<br><br>P.S. my eulogy for Terrence, complete with some classic Derek B.S.:<br><a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/5THxpeP.png?1">RIP Drone-lord</a></p>

                <p>Hey, Chun here. Thanks for the good game, despite Derek. I actually had a private conversation with him and he claimed roleplaying to be the reason for the things he did (hence also the Chao reference).</p><p>Yeah, finding 2 starmap pieces on day 3 and then making it to day 14 without ever finding the third one was kind of ridiculous. I don't think we found a single Cristalite zone in that time.</p>

                <p>First of all Derek is supposed to be a jackass, Second of all the seismic planet, was way better with orchards, more food, and 2 more artefact zones. Third is that everyone were so innactive, that without terrence everyone else just gived up. I mean, there are ships that make it day 30 with only 10 people ^^ The truth is i was active, shooting down hunters, stoping fires, repairing. Basically i used all my ap, to help the ship. I may say i wont do something, but after Terrence died, i immediately started trying to replace him. Also yes , i did not agree with you guys returning to SOL c: Its just that you gived up <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I would say, bad ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hey, Terrence here. Firstly, here's a link to the game: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4208" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4208</a><br>Secondly, thanks for the kind words, everyone, especially Ian <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It's nice to be appreciated.<br>It sucks you guys didn't make it to Eden, I thought it was a sure thing with our full O2, fuel, ship armour and plasma shield, but it looks like it just took too long for us to find a single cristalite zone <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> <br>It was a fun ship besides the griefing Kuan Ti, Stephen and Andie (with Derek not really making it pleasant), it really is a shame it ended the way it did</p>
