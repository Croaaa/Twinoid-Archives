In day 2 our Andie spored right in front of inactive Hua idling in Refectory. I don't know if it was she who then killed inactive Derek in Bravo Bay or her partner Terrence who mutated. Andie hid in a turrent and Terrence went to medlab - I believe he wanted to kill Chun, but medlab was only filled with inactive Raluca. <br>For we lacked a Tech we considered rushing the serum, but after Terrence openly suggested he would stay calm and wait for the cure that went a bit too far for some of us and we killed him.</p><p><strong>The Journey</strong></p><p>Without any techs, only one pilot who actively piloted and in the end 7 active people it was quite a hard time to get Pilgred done. Luckily for us Kuan Ti could go Tech in day 7 and we could finish Pilgred in day 9.<br>We had not much luck with our first O2 planet and were forced to go to a Mankarog planet. Tragic and funny thing: Gioele who found the planet told us he would easily handle that Mankarog - and was killed by it.<br>But the second journey of Roland and me (I had diplomat in the meantime) was amazing: O2, 7 steaks, HC and ... a jumpkin. Unfortunately it was already day 6 or something and with only 6 people alive it was very clear we wouldn't go very far. Still a nice planet. (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/HPG6j6F.jpg)" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/HPG6j6F.jpg)</a><br>We tried to last a bit longer, but fires, metalsheets and hunters made it necessary that I hacked the Command Terminal in Day 11 and brought us home to Sol.</p><p><strong>The RP</strong></p><p>The one thing which always is most important for me personally - and it was very fun, especially because of Paola and Roland who participated very much.<br>Though we had an active shrink, doing the thing might have been the mostly done activity on this ship - even Neron noticed that it was mainly Paola who had a never satisfied hunger: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3lGl30o.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/3lGl30o.jpg</a><br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ziOWRBn.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/ziOWRBn.jpg</a></p><p>Neron got more and more mad the longer the journey lasted - until it came to a final breakout:<br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/lxbHkL7.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/lxbHkL7.jpg</a></p><p>And then we returned.<br>Okay, Paola and Janice overcame their problems by ... guess what? Only thing I regret is that Paola and Janice hand't the time to invite Roland to join...</p><p><strong>Thanks</strong></p><p>Paola: You were a wonderful Communications Officer, Firefighter and morale raiser <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Also the reason with your RP the journey didn't get boring<br>Roland: Awesome work! Always active, always having AP - we wouldn't have come so far without you!<br>Kuan Ti: Your Tech skill really did the trick in the end. Thanks for your efforts<br>Stephen: I hope you enjoyed your first past-day-10 ship and thank you for all your healing help and stuff.<br>Gioele: You really should've avoided that Mankarog! Although your sacrifice gave us 16 O2</p><p>Hope to see some of you again.<br>Janice out.</p>

                <p>Roland here, as you two probably know already.</p><p>I usually end up taking a leading role in the Mush hunt regardless of character choice, but this one was rather simple given I stumbled onto both spore-related logs. Admittedly it was more luck with Terrence given we both entered Bravo Bay at the same time, with me picking up the Gloves just as he trapped. I don't really know why he mutated, would have expected a Transfer into me or Derek when he saw he was rumbled but might have already taken a second skill. I was disappointed he asked to be cured, although I was also disappointed that Jin Su asked about what we were doing, ignored all discussion, then killed him anyway. Turned out to be one of many mistakes and barely paying attention to what was going on...</p><p>We were fortunate enough to avoid any serious consequences of it, but Jin Su really did slow things down with only checking in literally once per cycle half the time. Piloting at the wrong times, Janice having to hack us around about the same number of times he did it normally, making us lose that awesome planet etc. Even at the end, I replied to him asking if we were going to Sol in less than a minute and Janice still had to hack us back. We probably could have gotten away with killing our other Pilot and having Stephen move us around, but we didn't know how things were going to go.</p><p>I only mentioned it about four times but there definitely seemed to be a lack of Hunters on this ship, although I did miss a big wave when I was out at a party. Most of the last five or six days were spent using 2 AP a cycle, apart from when I was watering plants or putting out fires. When Paola finally made the call to go back I was relieved - gameplay-wise this was a pretty boring ship.<br>A big part of that would be the inactives - this was one of my more noticeably inactive ships (I seem to have had good luck mostly) - Frieda, Raluca, Hua and Derek immediately; Ian, Chun and to a lesser extent Eleesha all just let themselves die.</p><p>As Janice said, the fun part was all the sex <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> As you also said, it was a shame that I was never really informed of the RP going on between you two in private. Paola suddenly claiming emotional ownership of Janice was pretty out of the blue for me, so the ending RP about Kivanc and you two actually loving each other seemed a bit weird to me as well.</p><p>Was still worth it overall though, thanks for the endurance ride with such a small crew.</p>

                <p>Hey! Sorry for the delay.</p><p>I'll forgo my usual method of going by each individual player (as there were several inactives).</p><p>Have to say despite the relative inactivity like Summer said, I still enjoyed the ship a great deal. Cellaryl, we <em>finally</em> got on a ship together after 8 tries, and I'm both sad and happy neither of us were mush. Speaking of, that was really a disappointing mush hunt. I wake up to find they killed completely inactive Derek and spored in front of Hua. Andie I think could chalk it up to inexperience, but Terrence? That was just sad. Killed the #2 best transfer target (inactive Derek, SERIOUSLY!), then running around throwing one punch at a time into each person, until you decided to surrender. Consider me upset.</p><p>Now, going to focus on the good in this ship! Eleesha, sorry you had computer troubles, you seemed like a pretty active person and it was a shame to lose you. Janice, what can I say? You were awesome! Same goes for Roland, Kuan Ti, Stephen, Gioele, and to a lesser extent Chun (what happened to you? You kind of disappeared on us before dying). So happy to have people invested into RP! Sorry it wasn't really in the open as much as I would have liked, we did keep a lot of it to ourselves. Kuan Ti, thanks for spending the 200xp to help with finishing PILGRED after our plan to cure Terrence was botched by the guy that gave me a mission to help cure Terrence <em>Paola glares angrily</em>. Gioele, it's a shame you had to sacrifice yourself in an effort to make-up to Paola! She kind of lost it after that event (and with contacting Kivanc, I felt really bad for the character I had worked to create). All of our relatively new people I really enjoyed shipping with!</p><p>Oh, and who loves it when the traders come by to give you PILGRED <em>after</em> your last inactive dies? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>About the hunters: I think our movement fuddled with the hunter waves. Each time we move <em>if I'm correct</em> it resets the counters, so while we were building up larger and larger waves, we'd leave before the massive wave appeared and it would reset to smaller waves (correct me if I'm wrong here).</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Sex? What sex? Paola <em>only</em> slept with 4 of the final 6 crew <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></span></p>

                <p>Hey Summer,</p><p>I'm sorry if I didn't include the others into the RP very well. I normally try and I think I did several times on this ship - only thing is that it was like most random ships I'm on - nearly noone wants jumps on the train and participates. Although I think we had our fun together, too <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br>I don't wanna force RP in general chat too much when I have the impression that there is just a very small group of people who actually enjoy and so I did most of my RP in private tabs after the first 4 or 5 days.</p><p>At least it seems I succeeded in touching Irishpolak emotionally in the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Cellaryl</p>
