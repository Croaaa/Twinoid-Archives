                <p>This ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2465" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2465</a></p><p>So... I was Jin Su, and this was my second time as Alpha.</p><p>Before I knew I was alpha, I'd already picked up the hacker kit; figured I was the best person to hold it until Chun came awake.</p><br><p>Once I found out I was mush, I waffled a great deal. Two players had purchased projects for the ship before mush were chosen, targetting assist and underfloor heating. The ship seemed extremely active. I could have slain Chun and Janice D1, as the connection to Sol had not yet been made and I knew where both were... But I looked at the projects, I looked at the activity, and I decided, 'no, this is a ship where I will convert, not kill'.</p><p>But I wasn't sure how to do this, I wasn't sure I could hide being Mush and convert, I did not wish to sleep to Sol or Eden... I waffled a great deal then decided to play obvious-mush with a twist, I trapped several rooms D1, then D2 when antispore gas wasn't quite done yet, I decided that nooooo, I didn't want to play under the gas.... oh yeah I can do something about it.... so I ran to the lab, grabbed sample and apron, and took off in a fighter with those and the hacker kit, not knowing that Neron would keep it aboard.</p><p>Ahh well, so a bit later I landed to be able to grab my communicator, I checked what was visible to me chat-wise, thought a great deal, and decided to run for the scrap ship.</p><p>I figured wanting to keep apron (and maybe sample) would keep me alive for a bit, I read the plans to try and rush magnetic net and move and kill me; I'd already posted (before mush were chosen) the cycles I was able to be on.</p><p>I hoped I could rest safely off ship, when I had the AP and a day change had made more spores possible, I hoped I could land when I wanted to (perhaps with my partner Chao confirming how many people were in Alpha Bay 2 and whatever guard room decisions might have been made...</p><p>I envisioned running amok, sporing people openly in some places, placing traps in others, running back to take off to space again when spores and/or AP were low, a rushing race perhaps where humans tried to trap and limit me and rush the net to force me to land when humans were best prepared for it, and what would be done about my predatory landings to trap me and try and destroy me at times of my choosing.</p><p>Then someone moved the ship.</p><p>That's fine; that's a totally acceptable human choice, though I hoped the odds of being able to collect scrap and reclaim the apron and sample might have prevented that decision from being made. I would have eagerly played fox against dog pack with you guys as long as I could have, just needed some more AP first. When I connected after my death I saw some chatter asking who had moved the ship and what talk there was about it sounded like it wasn't the popular choice.</p><p>So... can I ask what happened after I died? Was it Roland that moved the ship, and if so, was the cost worth it? What day did you go back to Sol on? I know Stephen picked up a spore but no one ended up converted, did anyone almost get turned? And Chao, what did you do after my death?</p>

                <p>I was Raluca on the ship. I have to give you props, that definitely shook us all up.</p><p>Finola grabbed the hacker kit and moved the ship pretty soon after you left, if I recall. No discussion at all with anyone unless in private. She almost got lynched for that, but we decided to make the best of the chaos and continue on anyway.</p><p>Frieda kept scanning for planets, but not a single one came up with oxygen until we were down to two or three cannisters. Unfortunately, no one seemed to be on at the same time with the MP to get to Icarus Bay to arrange an expedition down.</p><p>Chao mutated and attempted to kill Stephen, but in the end took out Janice. He was taken out after that. With zero oxygen, Finola and Terrence died. Roland and Kuan Ti jumped in to help me finish repaiting the Pilgred on Day 5 and Roland took us back to Sol seconds before we would have lost another person to oxygen loss.</p>

                <p>Oh wow, thank you for letting me know, Oleifr! And this was just your second ship too, ack.</p><p>Sorry about the bad O2 luck, and I'm glad I didn't cause that trouble for you guys, sounds like we would have had a desperately hard voyage, air-wise, no matter what mush had done that trip or who mush had been. I had one ship once were we found only 1 O2 planet in 25 planet searches... granted a mush was doing some of the searching, but no human found any air and that one O2 planet was reported by the mush. Heh, what she didn't say was that it had 2 deathtraps on it, and we navigated those without a death only to have a pump jam and get no air, so death won anyway that ship too.</p><p>Really hope you're having an awesome third ship!</p>

                <p>It's all good. My first ship had things run pretty smoothly until the very end when it was completely falling apart, so it was a fun to see the flipside where so many things can go wrong so early and still work out for the most part in the end.</p><p>I think one of the biggest effects that was immediately apparent with the loss of Pasiphae was no scrap metal to build the sofa. I eventually dismantled the microwave to get scrap, although I don't know if anyone ever actually got around to building the sofa in the end.</p><p>I have to say that your planned rampage would have been fun to watch go down. Even though I had started the thread about online time, I don't know that I would have thought to go back and check that to try and figure when you would be back around and likely to attack.</p><p>I just started my third ship tonight, so it's still filling up. So far everyone is posting, so that feels like a good sign. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Hope that your current ship is also kicking some mush ass (or human ass if you're mush again).</p>

Since I start new games as soon as I die... I have to say that killing me when she did, Finola did me a great favor.</p><p>Two other things I forgot to mention, that affected my strategy and how very scared I felt - there were <strong>2 level 5 players</strong> on this ship, Stephen and... Drat, now I can't remember who the other was.

                <p>I was Roland and thought that was a pretty shitty mush play, honestly. It's such an easy way out to grab important shit and run. Regardless of plans to come back and go on a rampage it just seems like the type of "I don't want to play mush" type of strategy.</p><p>That said, I still don't forgive Finola for choosing to hack and move the ship. It was a terrible decision. Magnetic net could have gotten the pasiphae back if we were lucky enough to have it pop up as a project, would have forced you to land and we could deal with you on our schedules, not if we just happened to be active in the 2 minutes you were on board before taking off again.</p><p>I'm incredibly sorry I bought Targeting Assist for that ship, but I am glad we at least did semi-ok. It's unfortunate that we never did actually do an expo for oxygen, but at least we got most of the humans back to Sol.</p>
