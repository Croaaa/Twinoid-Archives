                <p>Derek here, thought I'd make a thread for this ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6569." target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6569.</a><br>I'm a little surprised its already over, I thought there might be a long-shot chance of making it back to Sol.</p><p>The ship started off better than most. We had an active Jin Su (those seem so rare these days) and Janice, plus Andie even had Confidante - morale wasn't going to be an issue. We had a Gold Ian who was serious about Research, Gioele with Paranoid and Solid, and an active Terrence, Paola, and Raluca. Our pilots were quiet, but both were active. Beyond an idle Eleesha in FC, everyone seemed to be alive it looked like we were going to have a great ship....that is until #16 Gioele woke up and me and Stephen were chosen as Mush.</p><p>Me and him weren't necessarily a bad team, but we didn't do much planning. Stephen could only be on a few times a day, and beyond me discouraging him from doing anything that would get himself killed in a flash, we didn't coordinate. On my end, I decided I would try to play an UTR game for awhile, and use my position as Mush hunter to "accidentally" kill off "suspicious" humans for as long as I could. With an inactive Eleesha, I knew I'd have plenty of freedom.</p><p>Unfortunately for everyone, the RNG had other ideas. I started by relaying in the Nexus, but after that Andie asked for some help in the lab. Since I had just posted, and since I had been in a bed, I knew I had to go and help. On the way, I decided to be a good human and drop Paola's sofa BP on the Bridge. That's when I had my first piece of bad luck: I hurt myself picking up the BP, and dropped down to 12 HP. "No big deal", I thought, I'll get one back at day change anyway.</p><p>I relayed Andie once in the lab, then pretended to go AFK while Andie, Ian and Jin Su worked on the early research. At around day change, I realized Jin wasn't going to return to his bed in BD. I waited until I had 7 AP, then I ran to take the bed as my own. I extracted two spores along the way, but they had already finished Constipaspore and ASG and I had to take Fertile to get them. I took a sneaky shower and had my second piece of bad luck when I lost 4 more HP in the shower. I suppose it's better than having another accident and losing 6, but that thought wasn't very comforting. Frieda had already found a planet, but since I only had 9 HP after day change I couldn't risk going on the expedition. I knew someone would notice that I was missing way too much HP way too early.</p><p>But what the RNG did to me next felt a little personal. Maybe it doesn't like me when I'm Derek. My last game, I was also Derek, and I went on an expo with 11 HP at the start. Two of the three others had less than me, but all the damage was spread out so unevenly that I died. It wasn't even that rough of a planet either! So coming back to this game, the fact that fate decided my life wasn't hard enough, and that it needed to hit me with a steel plate, for the full -6 HP, on <em>DAY TWO</em>, seems mean.</p><p>Now I was lying in bed with only 3 HP. If anyone decided I was suspicious I would drop in a second. And that's when I knew what I had to do. I had been too quiet for too long, I didn't have a chance of converting anyone, and getting back most of my HP without arousing suspicion was also out of the question.</p><p>I decide to make my move right before the cycle change to c8. I had filled my AP gauge at c7, but if I waited it would give me 2 more AP to work with. I was ready! And then Terrence walked in, fresh from an expedition, and punched me out of bed. His punch connected, and I had only 3 HP...</p>

                <p>Gioele here.<br>Hehe, I guess your bad luck spree turned around when you rampaged, you killed off pretty much every active crewmember despite Ian, the old Jin su (at that point stephen) and myself, although I wasn't able to be all that active, and with no pilots after Hua's death (lack of moral) we simply got destroyed by hunters. Didn't help that I was the new captain, couldn't move the ship most of the day.<br>Well, you really had a great killing spree there, I'd probably have gotten the first injury on my side on the very first hit.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Now I have to think of witcher and the sword of destiny - death is after you and you spread death where ever you go. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>But luckily, Terrence only did 2 HP worth of damage! I survived, with 1 HP while he took my bed as his own <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>At one point, my plan had been to attack some people, then Transfer into Janice. I would be able to kill the Technicians as Derek, finish my old 1 HP body after the transfer, and maybe hurt Chun a little too before going down. But after some thought, I realized that a Derek already w/ 2 spores + Phagocyte + Fertile would be an incredible combo.<br>I had one more spot of bad luck when my computer decided to lag right when I was supposed to begin the fun - that caused me to start right after cycle change instead of right before. It happened because I had to be careful, I was afraid that if I started, then waited until after cycle change to continue, someone could have noticed and killed me in one hit.<br> <br>So on D2C8, I took Phagocyte as my second skill and began my rampage! Terrence was the first target - he and Andie had both taken some damage on the expedition and I knew he would go down easily. I wasn't wrong! I used 4 AP in that attack, so I ate my first spore to bring myself out of the danger zone. My initial targets were the Technicians, so I ran to the Nexus, where Raluca was sleeping under a camera. She died in a few hits too. Next I went into the rear storage units - I hadn't seen either of the Blasters, so I was hoping I could find one there. Then I could put my Shooter points to good use. But no, they weren't there and the logs didn't give me any clues as to who had them. I ran back to BD, and killed off Andie. Gioele was also in the room, but I decided to let him be.</p><p>Now the ship had no Techs, Polyvalent+Confidante Andie was gone, and I still had about 6 AP. It was time to pay Alpha Dorm a visit! I found Janice, the pilots, and Kuan Ti there. Instinctively, I attacked Janice first. As soon as I let off my first punch I regretted it; Kuan Ti had been much more active so far, and I felt like he deserved some recognition for that. But I finished off Janice anyway; just as I was about to leave to hide behind Ian, I decided to check the dorm's shelf. And what a surprise! I found one of the Blasters! I could kill Kuan after all!</p><p>To his credit, Stephen being mostly inactive made it so that both spores for Day 2 were still available. I extracted and Phagocyted them both. That meant a total of four spores eaten for +16 HP; whicj wasn't ideal, since it wasted some precious HP but trying to wait until they attacked me to eat another spore would be too tricky. With my last spore's energy, I ran to the lab, hit Chun with all my remaining strength and then fell back into the Medlab under Ian's protection. If I had started when I had planned, I really might have been able to finish her off too. But now all I could do was wait, and enjoy the 5 straight death reports covering the general chat <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>After a few minutes, Gioele was the first to see what happened. And he was Solid, so I knew I had to prepare for him to throw me out. Naturally, he threw me into FC, but was only able to punch me once before I ran back to Ian. Chun came in next, and punched me in retaliation. But thanks to Ian she couldn't do much. It was like a small party after that. Chun, Gioele, me and Ian, all in the medlab, waiting for something to happen.</p><p>When one hour had passed, I was sitting with 11 HP. As soon as the next cycle, c1, rolled around, thanks to Fertile+Phagocyte I would gain +8 HP and +5 AP, as well as another shot with the Blaster. Enough for one more kill, maybe?</p><p>But it was not to be, because that one hour mark was almost exactly when I noticed that Jin Su entered the medlab and Ian was online. Clearly, the humans were coordinating my execution. It turned out that Ian had been holding the other blaster! He dropped it, and I immediately went for it. <br>Too bad I had picked up the scooter earlier; I had to drop it before I could grab the gun! But Jin Su got to it before I did; he was a Shooter and unless Jin Su had some bad luck with the gun* I knew I was finished. He took two shots, then Ian stepped out of the room and Jin Su finished the job. My rampage had come to an end.</p><p>I'm proud of what I managed to do, considering how close I came to dying having done <em>nothing</em> that same day. 5 Active humans dead, one more Mush still onboard, and no technicians. Still, I was afraid the people who were left might be able to recover, for instance, if Paola found a Tech mage book thru Xyloph. I see that that didn't happen. You guys were a good crew, and going by some of the comments, it's always nice when most of the people aren't angry about how things went done. I'd love to see pretty much any one of you on another ship someday!</p><p>*Incidentally, the second to last time I was Derek, I was Mush too. I missed with the Blaster three times in a row that game. Twice. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p>

I think I got more than my share of lucky hits, and I remember noticing how few of my punches were missing.
