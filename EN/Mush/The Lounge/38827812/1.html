                <p>Hey guys Janice here. I was the last Mush.</p><p>Here is The End: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4214" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4214</a></p><p>The two Alpha Mush were Stephen and Gio and neither of them took Anonamush, it was Jin Su and I who did after getting infected. To answer your question on how they did it I can only answer for myself. I was on the first expo where we got hit with a Mush Trap in the Crystillite (I believe Jin was turned there). After that I was on my way to put out a fire when I triggered a trap in Rear Corridor (they used traps quite a bit).</p><p>Anyhow when that happened I played the long game while relaying a bit of info on who Paola was suspicious of... Speaking of which, Wow Paola I wish I was a Human on your ship, you were amazing. Also Raluca was great. And of course my Mush comrades. I think Roland was very hard to like even if he was effective (I still disagree that Andie has to have Pilot and think you killing him was a big mistake).</p><p>Oh and what were you guys thinking going on that expo without me? All three of you getting killed killed the ship! It was hilarious.</p>

                <p>lol and noone notice those two mush that took anonymush....well most of the players seems quite new/unskilled. like i said i would have killed so many crew members cause they did awefull.</p><p>killing andie was by far the stupidest thing that happened. i calucalted his ap and there was nearly nothing left to make spores or anything. but many players dont see andie replaces finola so polyvalent is the thing you need. in my opinion one of the best skills in the game.<br>eleesha killing terrence was the second great thing that happened......why? just why?<br>but i laughed hard as jin died <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> but lucky for us i never thought he was mush.</p><p>the last expo was just the topping on this trip.</p>

                <p>I kept alot of people alive because I was playing the long game (especially after Jin Su got steel plated). I wanted no one to suspect me and for them to take me back to sol (Success!).</p><p>With you specifically I needed you to finish Pilgred but I also needed you because you were the most blood thirsty player near the end. Not that I blame you. Getting rid of Eleesha especially was nice and I needed Gio to get killed at some point too (since it was clear once Jin died that the mush taking the ship/killing everyone wasn't going to happen). You were my best hope for that.</p><p>I practically danced with joy when Eleesha pointlessly printed the list (anymore I almost never print it as Eleesha so I can check for Anonamush late game). And when the expo died... I just couldn't believe it.</p><p>Anyway it was fun. I hope some of our other crew find this thread and we can get some more insights on who did what and why.</p>
