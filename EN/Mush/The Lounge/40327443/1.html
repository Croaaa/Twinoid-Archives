                <p>This ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4977" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4977</a> I was Andie.</p><p>Oh this ship. Oh wow, this gem of a ship.</p><p>The mush were dangerous. Jin Su, at least/most especially.... Oh wow, dangerous. We had 4 mush showing on the bar before we identified who most of the mush were.</p><p>This was the first time I saw green jelly used, and wow. Jin converted two people with it. I thought.... But Stephen was beta, so.... I am even more confused. But that whole 'Jin breaks it, prolly spikes someone, then Stephen comes along to fix it, probably spikes someone before he does, boom, another convert'... that was.... nasty.</p><p>We barely got mush dead, cure made, Pilgred fixed, and us hacked back to Sol; like 4 cycles before we could return to Sol newbie Commander Frieda tells us, I have to leave for two days, bye!</p><p>This ship had me on pins and needles almost all game. Most of us were mush or newbie. Many inactives. Most of the mush did not seem to be newbie!</p><p>Raluca, I just wish you'd used my chitchat skill throughout the game. You only used it once, at the very, very end, the last day of your life. If you'd chatted every time you could.... You'd have lived to see Sol with us. Janice can save you.... Andie can only allow you to save yourself. And not even that if you let it go to late. I was sooooo sure you were mush. I didn't think you were turned at the end by Stephen, I thought he'd gotten you earlier.</p><p>Stephen, you have <em>nothing</em> to apologize for. You so were a very worthy adversary. I was just sure you were mush, and I was going to shoot you with lizaro every cycle until dead, no saving throw, however long it took. Catching you was hard enough.... I actually was so sure Raluca was a mush that after Ian made a mycoalarm go off while he was alone.... I -still- used that cure on Raluca. If she'd been mush and kept Pilgred from us.... we were dead.</p><p>As was, Raluca depressed to death with Pilgred still 66 AP from completion.... and this ship with only 8 alive, with two of those 8 apparently idle (Roland didn't move from Icarus bay for like 24 hours after expo, and Janice was grand inactive and starved a couple cycles before we could finish Pilgred), with hunters to deal with, repeat fires, Both O2 tanks breaking on the same cycle, low AP, morale issues, injury issues, and many of us less experienced players....</p><p>Guys alive at the end, you did it. We fixed every challenge, saved everyone left who wasn't inactive, and won the game for the human team. The closest, most dangerous game for humans I've had the pleasure of playing human in.</p><p>Chun.... Without you, your patience, your cooperation, your curiosity, your constant involvement.... this ship would have sank. You don't need to already know what to do; you just need to be able to do it once you do learn.... and wow, you sure can do. Mush killer, ship saver, fixer of this, that, and the other thing - you made this work.</p><p>Paola, quiet, reliable, steady; wanting mostly to just do your job great. Sorry we dragged you into the mush hunting.... we rather needed to!</p><p>Eleesha, wow. Most players who become sure that someone is a mush on weak evidence don't really listen. You did. You cooperated, posted roomlogs, worked your hardest to keep up with things.... I actually suspected you were mush for about the first third of the game. But oh no; you were very, very human. And you did great!</p><p>Frieda. Oh, I so nearly killed you after you went idle. You didn't -say- you were grabbing the plants, nor did you say where you moved them to! I thought you had them; I thought you were going to let them die in your arms, trying to kill us; and too, commander and we can almost jump to Sol! If we kill you Hua is commander, so much easier! And you went idle in the dorm with both logistics people.... you who would not be using AP at all, and you'd eaten two of our 4 only foods left that day, and only advanced Pilgred once, when that was the only task that mattered anymore.... So glad Paola found the plants you silently moved... I had thought terribly unkind things about you. Whoops. For a new player, you did great. Keep communicating, keep playing. Good times ahead!</p><p>Roland.... gosh. You were sure our wildcard. First you kill Derek cause dirty, when he'd been dirty before mush selection and never left camera before death after selection.... then you're shooting at Ian (who I didn't know was a mush yet) while certain mush Stephen is running around.... I had no idea what you might do next. But you were part of our team, and you helped us win. Keep working on being calm and communicating more. Discuss suspicions with others.... it'll reduce the number of accidental (and poor choice) allied deaths.</p><p>Hua. Very quiet, very devoted to your job. You did what we needed most, pretty much all the time, be that killing hunters or getting us back to Sol. Glad you were with us.</p><p>Kuan, Gioele, Terrence, and sort-of Janice, you were our ghosts; bodies barely with spirits inside them. Still, Janice held on, silent, to just a couple cycles before the end. I was really starting to think both Janice and Eleesha were mush, because never eating, never morale boosting Janice just wasn't dying (and Eleesha had claimed couldn't print the list).</p><p>So.... mushes. Who was alpha? How were conversions done? What skills beside Green Jelly were used? 13 spores is not bad for essentially 5 days of play, with Gas up fast and Constipaspore following soon after. And wow, you guys ate! And ate! You ate like over half the food!</p><p>What else did you myco-enabled sorts do?</p>

                <p>Hey, Eleesha here. This was an unexpectedly fun ship. I'm still embarassed about Stephen tricking me twice into thinking he'd turned Raluca, and thus me almost getting Raluca killed. But in the end, we ended up calling the right shots on who to kill. Who knows, maybe my confusion earlier led to the mush being confused about what we really know, enabling us to catch JS and KT like we did? Unlikely, but it helps me sleep better at night. Thanks for being active and knowledgeable, Andie. Without you, the mush would have won.</p>

                <p>jin su here. was really a fun ship and some luck with the spores/traps. <br>Ian and I were alpha mush. ian didnt know what to do so i just trapped some shelves at nexus and RC. soon KT ran into my trap ~30seconds after it was placed and stand at nexus with me -&gt; infect, 2 spores on him.<br>so he had already 2 spores. i had to green jelly the cam at b dorm to convert him on the next day.<br>and then? just some more traps, always showering without soap so nobody noticed that i was dirty, using green jelly on the mycoalarms and cams and waiting to see who ran into the traps. some cycles later stephen had 1 spore and KT infected him with the second spore. and then again green jelly on the cam to get him.<br>and we were really lucky, stephen had mycellium spirit and afaik fertile as mush skills, so we could infect raluca with 2 spores the same day.<br>yeah, and then... ian still had 1 spore on him, we had active mushes and our plan was to convert raluca on the next day, hide at IB with 4 mushes and prepare for the final blow. but i had to go to work after converting stephen and when i was back i only saw my death-screen. so it was a bit luck for the human team that we didnt start our rampage some cycles earlier <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
