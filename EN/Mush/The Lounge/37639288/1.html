Hua exposed herself, threw away her walkie-talkie, transferred into Janice, and left with Pasiphae. But I didn't realize that, when Janice was saying she was flying away.. I never linked the two things together... Lack of experience.</p><p>Paola was killed when the ship was mush-free. Several crew members were complaining Paola inactive, who missed every rebel bases, and only decoded very few databases. We were worrying about missing the last one, which has a morale boost (given Janice is dead)? And some said Paola may be a mush by acting so inactive.. So I went ahead and murdered her.. Looking back, I should not have done that, because Stephen is only a little better.</p><p>Second, about <em><strong>my final decision to return to Sol</strong></em>.</p><p>Roland, Terrence and I are the most active players on the ship. With around 8 crew members, we sustained for the last 5 days. But after day 10, we were facing constant conditions. Luckily we got the shield to full. We also got two Starmap pieces, extremely luckily. But after day 10, everyone is injured all the time, got panic attack, etc. The ship has 13 broken equipment, including commander terminal and emergency reactor.</p><p>At D12C1, Terrence was critically injured, and died at D12C2... We had no tech left and yet even commander terminal is broken.. I checked the log, and found another two crew members plus me are with around 4-5 HP.</p><p>So, I drank the last coffee, picked up the wrench, went to the bridge for repair work. I hope my 10 AP can bring us back to Sol. But I only used 1AP to fix it! At that time, both Roland and I have to go to sleep, meaning no one will be attending the ship for 3 cycles. So I just pressed the button, and the game ends.</p><p>As Roland said, we were almost there in Eden with a bit of luck. I think if I didn't make the mistakes, this could be a perfect ship, and we could have made our way there!</p>
