Can someone from the mush team let me know? I thought we were doing ok until Roland revealed himself and then there were fires everywhere, the hunters kept appearing and our hull was being held together with duct tape. What happened?</p><p>Also I thought Finola was a mush, the research just wasn't getting done quick enough and you got dirty twice. I just wish I'd been more confident in my predictions.</p>

                <p>Rolland here. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So, Finola indeed converted Chao, but despite the fact he was gold with 3 skills - he was absolutely new. In the end, I am sure he was happy to get this new experience. At least he learned some mush mechanics.</p><p>As I was the only mush without anonymush, I've decided to sacrifice myself and stop people pushing on Finola. Also, as Terrence was the key pusher - I've killed him (<span class="tid_strike">and also because he foodtested</span>).<br>Actually the plan was to jump in Janice, finish convertion of Hua and turn on the ceasefire. And Finola would make the second ceasefire after so we could convert a lot of people ot get AP and plan how to kill others.<br>But something got wrong with my logic, so I didn' spike Janice before the end of the day and that's why I wasn't able to make a Transfer. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>That was a real fail, and I feeled ruined. Finally I've decided to remove the cameras and take off on Paciphae... Finola was very accurate in finishing convertion when Hua was active, so she took anonymush also.</p><p>I don't know if anyone was suspecting me at all. Maybe next time my strategy will be more sustainable</p>

                <p><strong><em>Finola</em></strong> here!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> A very excellent mush partner! I was initially feeling sad being Mush Finola in the beginning, because it's hard being mush Finola... but my spirits lifted quickly when Roland turned out to be a rock star mush who not only wants to work together, but also wants to play the subtle mush who converts everyone secretly - my favorite strategy! So many times I've had mush partners who doesn't work together, so you can imagine how happy I was, hehe. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Paola:</strong> I wasn't slow at all in research... remember, we had like 6 researches finished and only 1 project done at one point. If you suspected me because of my research speed, then you must have suspected the rest of the crew a lot more, because I kicked ass in research, hehe. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> The only researches that wasn't completed were the ones that required Chun to be in the Lab, and the only time I slowed down researching was because Apron was kidnapped by a human. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Terrence:</strong> I'm sure your other theory was that I was the Alpha mush, not Chao, and you'd be right. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> I tried my best to signal that me being Beta mush was the only possibility, but you weren't being tricked, hehe. Well done! I honestly did forget that DTT pregnancy gives 2 spores, though. In the entire time you were explaining your theory, you never did once remind me that DTT can give 2 spores, hence the confusion! It's a shame you foodtested intentionally, though, and then asked me to do the same. That ruined the fun a little.</p><p><strong>Chao:</strong> Don't worry about the mistakes! I hope you had fun as your first time mush! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Next time, you'll kick ass, I promise! Remember to always check human/mush indicator before selecting Anonymush. Also check the most recent messages in the mush chat, since someone might say something like "don't take anonymush!" or "take anonnymush now!"</p><p><em>WHAT HAPPENED...</em></p><p>So, to explain to everyone what happened that night in the Medlab...</p><p>I was Alpha Mush Finola. I didn't have any good reasons to get dirty, so I played it safe for the first few days while Roland did mushy stuff. After ASG, Consti and Alarms are finished (in record time, by the way), I decided that I should take some risks, since I figured I've bought some trust with my speedy research...</p><p>I took Fertile and extracted in C8 and C1 for free. I ate a +3 Morale pill. I picked up cat but did not hug it. Then I publically complained that I can't hug cat, and that I got panic attack (also someone was murdered recently, and day changed), so I had to eat a morale pill and got dirty from pill eating. I immediately rushed to BD and showered, and returned to Medlab. The idea was to give the impression that I was panicked with low morale, and made some mistakes. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now having two spores, I took two MycoAlarms and hid one in CBT so that it's out of play (do you know how hard it is to convert people with 5 cameras and 5 mycoalarms in the ship? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) I told people I hid the MycoAlarm in the Medlab, but actually I was carrying it on me, and I asked Chao to come in to DTT with me. He came in and flirted with me, and I intentionally waited for about 20 mins, such that he isn't online when I acted (specifically to prevent the double-Anonymush mistake), so I DTT and infected him (he had 1 initial spore), converting him! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I picked Anonymush immediately and told him in mush chat to <em>not pick skills</em> until we discussed strategy. He didn't respond for 5 minutes. I figured I'm safe from the double-Anonymush thing now... except about 30 minutes later, Chao suddenly woke up and picked Anonymush anyway! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> Turns out, it was Chao's first time as mush, hehe. He felt really bad about it, but I told him it's fine, because mistakes happens, even to the best of us. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>After that, I wasn't sure if I should rampage or not, because it doesn't take a genius to realize that the Anonymush thing happened exactly the same time Chao and I were DTT-ing. And when Chao rampaged and died and was revealed as Mush, I knew my fate was sealed... but Roland still wanted to play the secret mush. At this point, it was a challenge just to stay alive and not be killed by the crew... which actually sounded fun, so I agreed to it, hehe. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p><cite><strong>Paola: </strong> I wasn't slow at all in research... remember, we had like 6 researches finished and only 1 project done at one point. If you suspected me because of my research speed, then you must have suspected the rest of the crew a lot more, because I kicked ass in research, hehe. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> The only researches that wasn't completed were the ones that required Chun to be in the Lab, and the only time I slowed down researching was because Apron was kidnapped by a human. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></cite></p><p>I suppose it wasn't the research then. I think it was probably just the alarm bells whenever I see a dirty Finola. You guys were a good team and I would have suspected inactives if it hadnt been for the double anonymush situation. Roland you did really well integrating yourself into the mush hunt team. I wish I had more time to investigate things but I thought the best way to ensure people knew I was human was to rarely leave the bridge and focus solely on comms.</p><p>Also random point, did people like the announcements? I've never been comms officer before and I wanted to try doing RP style announcements.</p>
