I think we all really enjoyed that trip, except perhaps for our two mush, poor Finola and Paola, who can't have found it easy to be mush with such difficult roles and with such an active crew. Paola eventually became idle, and we killed her because she was on Eleesha's list and because she wasn't hungry, while the other inactives were slowly starving to death. Finola wasn't suspected at all because she was very active in the lab, helped by Ian, so research was going very well. But she did a few mistakes, like hiding an extinguisher and the medikit, and finally did a big mistake when she infected the cat.</p><p>So we were finally mush free, and we could enjoy a few days with a great, active crew. Eleesha was our efficient comms officer. Raluca steadily worked on Pilgred and projects, including the plasma shield, with help from Kuan Ti, Chao and Stephen, who also helped a lot in the lab. Terrence and Frieda were our elite pilots, and Frieda also did great on astrophysics, finding planets on which we did great expeditions (including the first one, for which you were a little careless, guys... it isn't safe at all to go on an expedition and leave the commander, the hacker kit and maybe 2 mush on board...). Ian, our botanist and biologist, led the research team and with Stephen's help grew a beautiful garden of 8 Bumpjunkins, despite a dramatic incident when Chao ate one of the jumpkins, which nearly turned our pacifist gardener into a ferocious murderer (I said "nearly" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>All in all, it was really an enjoyable ship, so thanks again, everyone. Hope we can play again sometime.</p>

                <p>Ah, I expected that our captain had to be a famous player of Mush. ^^</p><p>Ian here ;-)</p><p>The ship was beautiful, all problems of the ship were solved really quickly all the time, because the people were really good at helping each other :-)<br>I was already on another great ship some time ago but even there things weren't going that smoothly like on that ship. I think the cause was mostly our great Jin Su who was very active with moving the ship and giving kindly orders (actually they had more a character of advices) at each time when it was really necessary, the quick progress with research and Neron projects and that at least someone of the crew was active when it was necessary to act.</p><p>I think even when we decided to return to sol we had a hull of above 85 and a plasma shield of nearly 100 left ^^, we had no problems with oxygen and 8 mature jumpkin trees .<br>We just wanted return because Chun and Janice had died really early, so people were getting morale problems and the old wreck of Daedalus began to annoy us with room shakings and steel plates.</p><p>Yeah, when Chao was eating that jumpkin (at that time we had maybe 3-4 jumpkin trees) my botanic heart was almost broken and I was insulting him incredible lot... ^^ But in the end I have forgiven him.<br>And we learned quickly to find the precious jumpkin at almost each expedition, ;-)</p><p>Another personal success was showing Raluca the fun of living a hippie life (of course after she ate a jumpkin. With that jumpkin head she was suddenly even more attractive to me than before <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>I had a nice time on that ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>The plasma shield was down to 60 last night, it was still quite safe, but only because we managed to escape the last 22 hunters just in time. But it was people's morale and health problems that were starting to be dangerous. Eleesha, I was worried about you... You had been injured by a steel plate and the bridge kept shaking. You can't have had many hp left in the end.</p><p>I was quite impressed by Stephen too, it was his first ship and he was so active and helpful everywhere. I guess you were a good teacher, Ian, because you two were really efficient in the lab and with plants. And it was amazing the way you kept finding those jumpkins on every single planet.</p>

                <p>Frieda here. That was great <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Nine of us with over 200 Glory! Am I dreaming or did we get Bumpjumpins on our first two expeditions? They were both perfect planets with those forests &amp; orchards, imagine if we'd found a piece of starmap at the crystallite lol..</p><p>I thought it was a masterclass in how two small teams of researchers with everyone resetting can pretty much complete lab &amp; Neron in 10 days, with Plasma Shield along the way. That first expedition where Ian was determined to protect us from Crystallite infection that he expedited the completion of supersoap so we could wash off any spores afterwards. What with the mycoscan, alarms, soap etc Finola couldn't mush us up if she tried.</p><p>Shame the Daedalus became a fire hazard &amp; steel plate deathtrap with masses of hunters &amp; asteroids, I was hoping for an easy cruise home but we were lucky to get out without another casualty. Great crew, hope to work with you again <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
