                <p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3696" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3696</a><br>Hey everyone! Chun here, I wanted to put 'Wangless Chao' but it wouldn't fit in the subject line <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">. Wang and I are hardly the stars of the ship(Okay I lie, Wang definitely is), but I chose this name in hopes that Paola and Finola will find it.</p><p>This was a nice random ship with a good collection of players, including a new player who picked the game up quickly and turned into a valuable crew member! The mush hunt struck once when we killed Gioele because of his suspicious behavior, early dirtiness, and having taken damage afterwards..but he turned out to be a human. I'm surprised I wasn't on his lovely final moment box since I approved of 'Wang' killing him. I'm going to assume he didn't see my response to his death post.</p><p>So with that bust, I felt hesitant on our next suspect: Paola. While talking to 'Wang' in private about her, she made an amusing post along the lines of "Well I wouldn't have killed him for that...but keep up the hunt." By this point, Jin Su mentioned he was online and I asked him if he was close to the Bridge and could check the Comms Terminal for us since Paola got dirty eating a ration. He said no comms work was done whatsoever, so 'Wang' convinced me that we wouldn't strike twice. So I replied to Paola's post saying "Ok." and we proceeded to wrestle/stab her to death. I made a joke about being called 'Zhong Chun-Li' in her death thread, so that's where that part of the name comes from. It was a good try Paola, but I'd have stayed hesitant to kill you if you had done a Xyloph or two.</p><p>So one down and there was much rejoicing and 'Wang' and I were tired, almost totally out of AP/MP. I usually take a nap at around that time and I was already dragging when Finola came into Bravo Dorm while 'Wang' was discussing minor suspicions for Janice. Finola removes the camera, to which I asked him "Uh...what is Finola doing?". Well that should be obvious..<span class="tid_strike">so I stabbed her to death</span> thought about a previous ship where I stabbed a Transfer victim without checking for his skills first and before I could even do that, I get a whisper from Finola saying that she's Chao. Sure enough, neither Finola nor Chao had any skills until a second later when Chao suddenly has Shooter...and not Wrestler. So we called old Finola 'Chaola' (Actually I suggested Finochao but Chaola won the popularity vote), who certainly did go out in style. She whispered to me that we should kill Finola quickly, something that I pasted to old Chao (Now 'Wang', named after the body part he woke up without, as Kuan Ti put it.) who made an amusing response about not sounding like that and having to adjust to his sudden new fear of dirt and grime and confusing lab calculations running through his head. I whispered back to Chaola something along the lines of "Oh Finnie, how could you? We were going to have so much fun stabbing me with needles for the sake of humanity and ending the mush threat together!" So she mutated and tried to off me with what little energy she had left, but even if Kuan Ti and Terrence didn't come in to finish her, I had Nurse Points and the Medikit to keep me alive. So with that, we concluded that the mush hunt was over. A good try given that mush Paola/Finola is a painful Alpha team to wind up with.</p><p>So with the mush threat over, it was time to get some work done to get us alive to at least Day 10. It took about a day before Wang found the walkie that Chaola stashed away. Eleesha was also a new player who seemed like she was going to keep playing at the time, except she went inactive with the Comms title for quite a while..I assume she had no AP when she stopped playing. We had a hard time getting Pilgred finished at first but we did scrounge up enough teamwork to get it done. I moved into the Refectory at this point to tap as much coffee as possible since my work schedule allows me to be active on all but one cycle long enough to hit the coffee machine. There was no point in any Research at the time because Wang was needed on the Bridge since, you guessed it, Frieda was brain dead (Along with Ian and kind-of Stephen). Hua was also quarantined for some reason, not sure what she did but it didn't hurt us too badly since we had three other pilots already.</p><p>-Finally-, Eleesha goes inactive so the Comms Officer title passes on to....Stephen. Joy. I'd already been riding on Stephen for roaming the ship and not saying anything, finally he replies to me that he's not new and didn't realize the title passed on to him, that he's normally very active but he's busy of late. Forgiveable, but he really should have mentioned that sooner, because I was very close to killing him. So he gets a few Xylophs done for us (Figures, the mage books were one of the last ones to come out) until he starves to death and the title finally goes to Janice, who's been very active and helpful. But it's already Day 8 or 9 at this point, all the signals are gone, none of them decoded..so there wasn't much for Janice to do really except get us Automatic Sprinklers and she was already stretched thing keeping comforts up. I helped her out there thanks to our Shrink mage book but without her we'd have all died days ago.</p><p>We nearly ran out of oxygen <em>twice</em> and barely managed to find decent planets before almost asphyxiating, finding 32 and 24 units a piece. Don't remember who found the first planet (Probably Kuan Ti) but I know Kuan Ti found the second one. Wang read the Biologist mage book (She had Bronze Medic) and together with me and Jin Su, we utilized 3 coffees, a mission, and a +3 AP -2 Morale pill (Which I offset with a comfort) to finish the Retro-Fungal Serum in one sitting. So that was awesome.</p><p>After going a good while without hunters, we jumped to the second planet with oxygen to find..<em>43 of them waiting for us!</em> We were down to 40 Hull left too, so..I was little afraid. Still, we pressed on, quickly raced through the expo, took out Aracks somehow in that mess and left most of them behind. 9 hunters left on the next cycle, but we drop down to 18 Hull. There wasn't much point in pressing our luck so we agreed to go home. Litttle bit early for the update but I'm sure we can wait a day before playing again.</p><p>So that was our ship, and I hope you readers feel a little more inspired in knowing that random jumps can still land you with a good crew that you'd love to fly 12 days together with. New players join and most of them idle out but we do get people like Terrence who stick around and make the game enjoyable, so thank you again Terrence and I hope your future ships are just as successful!</p><p><strong>Wang</strong> - You were an exceptional research and mush hunting partner, good luck in your new life with whatever genitals you may or may not have.<br><strong>Jin Su</strong> - You were a great Commander, always active when we needed you to be. I wasn't scared at all when your title momentarily passed to Kuan Ti, I figured you were just saving up energy for the inevitable hunter onslaught.<br><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> - Your drive to get Projects done was healthy for the ship, even if I disagreed with you on a thing or two. I'm sure we'd have made a good team if I had a more Project-oriented character.<br><strong>Raluca</strong> - I was well aware that I logged off in the Medlab towards the end, but as Kuan Ti pointed out, I was a Shrink so it balanced your morale out. You did a great job taking care of plants, I could tell that you wanted to move into Research but I apologize that Wang and I were too focused elsewhere on the ship. Your repairs went a long ways, too!<br><strong>Roland</strong> - That golden supernova would have been yours if not for Chaola's transfer and you'd have deserved it for keeping us safe for 12 days! See you in another life, space cowboy..<br><strong>Janice</strong> - You were -all over the place- girl, planet scanning, Neron resetting, Plant watering, answering comfort requests..and on top of all that, you were very efficient with the scooter in knowing when and where to use it and how to leave it available for the rest of the crew. So awesome job, as I said above, we'd have died without you.<br><strong>Stephen</strong> - I get that life can get in the way, but we are your crew. You can tell us if you're not going to be able to be very active if emergencies arise <em>before</em> we have to threaten you on the main channel. I hope you get whatever that is bogging you down taken care of before you join your next ship. Stephen or not, every crew member needs to be as active as possible.<br><strong>Gioele</strong> - If you missed my post to your death but somehow find your way here, try to be a little less suspicious at the start of your ships. Yes, the Medkit test by itself is not perfect evidence, but combined with your bad excuse for being dirty it made you our #1 target. I also tried to let you know that multiple accounts are against the rules.</p><p><strong>Paola and Finola</strong> - Keep up the good fight for the mush elsewhere in the multiverse, you may have lost early on our ship but you did your duty to the mush cause. Perhaps next time we'll be on the same side, or maybe <em>I'll</em> be the <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> mush &gt;: )</p>

                <p>"Wang" here, it was indeed a very good ship. I was very happy when I, as Chao, found that you, Chun, was very active and knowledgeable, you were the perfect partner to hunt the Mush and we did do it well.</p><p>I'm sorry for Gioele's death but eating Day 1, getting dirty, not reporting any progress on research or projects, asking for people to kill him and being hurt is just too much circumstantial evidence to overlook.</p><p>Paola, it was a good try but I've seen it before, dirty Paola "eating" day 1 yet no comms work done whatsoever, that's just screaming for a Mush rampage to happen. Especially since you were active and talking, and if you were human you would have had a full AP bar a while ago, yet you were still sleeping in Bravo Dorm.</p><p>I suspected Janice to be the second Mush because she was hurt and in Bravo Dorm as well (Where did all of you get hurt anyway? You didn't pick up the cat...), but before we could do anything Finola, whom I didn't suspect at all, transferred into me and thanks to Chun's and I quick reaction, she was found out almost immediately, and killed by the crew. She did leave me dirty and with a camera in my inventory that stayed there for the whole rest of the ship.</p><p>I think I found the first planet to give us oxygen, it was getting really low with only 4 or 5 left I think, but we brought back a ton and then the garden, kept in perfect order by Chun and Raluca, gave us enough oxygen to hold on far into Day 10+.</p><p>We did manage to complete Pilgred, the retrofungal Serum, and we held on pretty well until a massive wave of hunters came by and forced us to come back. I don't think we would have been able to achieve much more, given our lack of real planet expert on scanning duties, so it was all well and good.</p>

                <p>I'm glad I could help, Terrence! If you ever need to know anything else, feel free to shoot me a PM or ask on the Questions/Answers thread, they are very quick to answer. These [AP] threads usually last a little bit longer than ours did when more crew members find them after the ship ends. It's a good way to add new contacts so you will be able to remember the people you flew with and theoretically, can suggest them or ask them for help in getting into castings someday when those become available.</p>
