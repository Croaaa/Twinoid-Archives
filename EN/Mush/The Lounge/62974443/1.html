                <p>Link to ship : <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/13182" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/13182</a></p><p>So I was not sure if I wanted to make this and am not sure if all my crew will see this. But I thought this ship deserved an AP thread for itself. I was Jin Su <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Ship started out really crazy. We had a very active crew with a lot of talents. Moment I started out we already had PS and crew was very talkactive, and as a Jin Su I really really wanted to play actively with them. Our journey was really great, we had a lot of good projects and dealt with hunters with ease. We got mush free by D9 and tried really hard for Eden. But we were unlucky.</p><p>And thats maybe the only factor that we lacked from reaching Eden. Hell we survived till day 18 with ease. Most of crew which were active had high HP and morale and things in ship were amazing. Everything was stable thanks to Raluca, Roland, Chun, Eleesha, Janice, Terrence, Derek and Andie. ((Sorry if I forgot someone)) Yet only thing that prevented us from that goal was luck. We had planets with three IL and one cristalite and didn't get anything. D13 had our first starmap but had no luck after that.</p><p>Really if we didn't lose Ian in expo we would live beyond day 20 and still worked for Eden since crew was really putting a lot of work behind that goal :/</p><p>SO I really want to thank people from my ship, Raluca which was an amazing tech and kept ship together and always fixed stuff, Chun and Eleesha and Janice which kept the ship alive, Roland and Derek for dealing with hunters, Ian which am really sad that we lost cus he was a great player and knew what he was doing, Andie which was not so talkactive but helped when he was needed, Paola which was a great comms officer but kinda fell inactive in late game.</p><p>This crew was really good, hope to see you all around! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>hello there. its Ian here.<br>i have to be honest , i have never expected to die from getting lost in Cristalite then dying in MIA zone. it was by far the ugliest way to die in this game. you get your hopes up for eden then simply die.</p><p>but regardless it was a very fun ship with fantastic active crew , i keep playing just to run into such ships even if it takes months to land in one like this one. so thank you all for making it a fun ship in these dark times .<br>also it was my first time with frugivore and fully functional bumpkin garden. and to make it even better Andie got us the noise canceling project to give us 14 AP bar which made eating tuns of jumpkins much more efficient. it was a Dream. <img src="//data-rockfaller.twinoid.com/goalImg/105afde814434ac155573e2740530f8e" alt=":rfj_halloLantern_1:" class="tid_img tid_parsed" style=""></p>
