Tick tock tick tock. 9 minutes, 30 seconds left. That's all we have left on this ship, as I write these.</p><p>At first, I wanted to call this "Underwhelming MMM: part 2", but as I read into that, I quickly realised that would be an exaggeration of our fate, although not by much. (Why do I feel like a jerk as I write these judgemental words? The problem may be in me, but oh well.)</p><p>My name is <strong>Janice Kent,</strong> and this is my story.</p><p>Currently it is day7cycle8. We have 4 fires, 2 broken doors, 8 pieces of equipment broken, 9 hunters on us. That is 9 hunters for our 9 armor, and zero O2 for our 5 alive personel. The last 3 suffocated one by one.</p><p>I'm...not sure what went wrong. Honest.</p><p>The mushes on the ship were...mediocre at best. One was quickly killed on the first day, (it was Jin if I remember right), leaving me, Janice as the sole active morale support. The second mush (andie I think, who was converted I assume) was found and killed when she tried to kill me, leaving me with 1hp. The third mush, Raluca, was killed as she tried to decimate Hua, but was unable to finish the job too. After Chun stabbed her a few times, my punches painted the walls red. Her blood is still on my clothes since then.</p><p>Did the mush do anything significant? Ehm.....I can't count anything really. Both assassinations failed, but they got one convertion and...that's about it as far as I know.</p><p>Aaaand our ship died. Link is provided at the top.</p><p>Where to begin with the ship's NORMAL, not mush, HUMANE crew. Man...<br>We had an inactive <strong>Kuan Ti</strong>, who starved and suddenly burst to life on day...5? 6? This is extra funny because that was the <strong>EXACT</strong> cycle Raluca rampaged and went trough the dorm he was in. To this day, I don't know what exactly happened, apart from pure coincidence. At least Kuan said, "sorry for being afk". (almost exact words and writing.)<br><em></em><strong>Ian</strong><em></em>, our professional gardener decided that life was for suckers and suicided himself by the cat on day 4-5. Why? No words were spoken by him about this.<br>Terrence and Gioele were inactives from the start, not much I can say about them.<br>I'm unsure about Eleesha...she died extremely quickly, but I don't know on how or why she was killed.</p><p>The ones who were not mentioned: You guys were active and did your job on the ship, which is commandable. Every one of you has to be praised for that.</p><p>But man, we were unlucky as frick.<br>Frieda scanned but found us no useable planets with o2. She scanned a <strong>LOT</strong>, and was active enough that she was a suspect of being a mush for not providing us with a good planet/delaying, but as the endgame tells us, that was not the case.<br>We had two expos, got a starmap and fuel, which is great, but no o2, as the pump jammed on our last ditch effort.</p><p><em>Sigh.</em> Where did we go wrong? I do not know. I would mainly say that people simply were not active or communicative enough, apart from a selected few. Most did their job, but rarely reacted to outside things. By that, I mean one thing, one stupidly simple thing that <em>NO SHIP EVER SEEMS TO DO</em>: Take orders when our life depends on it.<br>Now, when I say this, I hope nobody takes it personally, but dangnaggit, when we have less than a day's worth of oxygen, and I shout with bold letters that ERRIBODY SCAN, please, for the love of god, do that. No need to decode rebel bases, no need to progress that serum we're never going to use, no need to anything, but that. This is a problem that I have on almost every ship that requires multiple people to save us. <br>Same thing happened when people realised what I have been spamming for a day that "oh, we are actually going to die within day", and started repairing the Pilgred after the scanning time has passed (we had less than ~5 cycles to live before people started dying, which is barely enough for a scan+expo under usualy circumstances.) Pilgred was never finished with one technician, for multiple reasons that I won't go into nitpicking.</p><p>As you can see, both attempts to live failed. Our ship has died, not to the mush, but to our own incompetence. Hunters have shot trough our armor on day7, at a time when 3 people have already died to suffocation.</p><p>You may ask now, "Alright, but how does that connect to the thread's name?"<br>Just like Half Life 3, this ship started nicely, had a good hype behind it for being an MMM, the skills showed promise, but after several delays and slow communication, it just fell apart and nothing major was ever achieved, even though the potential was there.</p><br><p>Oh and as always, be sure to like comment and subscribe....I mean share your opinions on what have you seen, why does your opinion differ from mine, and why I'm a ordering asshole. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hi, Andie here! Raluca turned me when she took down the cam and proceeded to rampage. I was going to lie low, but honestly, for the reasons you mentioned, the ship didn't have much of a future anyways (which is a shame because it started out great). But then we went on that expo where I got lost (I decided to pick Traitor because what the hell), and then caught an illness, so you could have figured me out by looking at the expo logs. I went to sleep for a cycle, extracting the last O2 right before cycle change hoping it would hit someone other than Kuan-Ti, had full AP and decided to at least take down Hua as she was the last tech, but couldn't finish her off, unfortunately. Raluca had already extracted both spores for the day, so I couldn't really do much more.</p><p>But yeah, I enjoyed playing with everyone who was active, even grumpy Hua <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I was Chun.<br>I want to say that most of the games of MUSH that I've played, I've either been at school or unemployed, and thus had LOTS of time.<br>However, I got a job on Monday, and my time was cut WAY down.<br>I picked Chun because she isn't needed for much. (My Astropad doesn't work so I wanted someone who didn't need to know where stuff is. The job surprised me.)</p><p>At any rate, I still tried to be active and pulled off a few key moves. Saving Andie (which turned out to be a bad thing as she was MUSH) then killing her (so at least I got glory!), for instance.<br>I wish I could have done more, like I usually do, but I couldn't. Still, I'm kind of sad to see that I was one of the more active players (relatively speaking).</p><p>Anyways, what happened with Jin, was that he spored in a corridor and didn't notice that Eleesha was there. Oops. So he killed her and tried to cover it up, but it was too late.<br>I'm not sure what Raluca was doing, but MUSH can stay low pretty easy on a ship that isn't that active. (No projects, for instance.) She did convert Andie, so there was a trail to follow, so shame on us.</p><p>We were doomed long before Raluca or Andie's rampages. Having Jin, then Gioele and then Stephen as our captains really set us back. Derek taking our Astro book, was also a problem. Yes, he found a planet, but he should have been a Pilot with his Shooter skill and someone else should have scanned.<br>We didn't get research done right. (We did the gas and bacteria, then the alarms. We didn't do the serum, so the MUSH could still use spores for AP. I'm sure this helped Raluca turn Andie.) Terrence being inactive meant only Hua was available for Pilgred. Which then also means that we only have Roland for shooting hunters.<br>It just cascaded.</p><p>Well, sadly, I think this is my last MUSH for awhile. I can't really play this now that I'm working. Kinda sad it was on a ship that was mostly meh.</p><p>Oh well, on another MMM ship with GT at least. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

How it was talked that we should quickly do the research that allows us to see the mush channel for possible infections? You know, the research that would have instantly opted out Andie?

                <p>Raluca here. With Jin getting caught the second he turned when Eleesha walked in RC as he was extracting his spores, I expected my mush run to be over. At least he managed to kill Eleesha, giving me free reign for a good while.</p><p>My original plan was to rampage with Andie and fly to space (I read the pilot book), but Andie figured they might remain unnoticed so I just rampaged on my own. I'm extremely surprised it worked, why did you think I removed the AD camera? I probably went a bit overboard hiding research items and should have just spent more AP on murder.</p><p>Unfortunately Chun had been practising her surgery skills and stabbed me right in the inner ear! Ow! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/puke.png" alt="°x°" class="tid_ico">That made my escape to space impossible as it would have cost extra AP and MP to do anything. Janice got me before I managed to restore AP anyways.</p><p>How Andie got converted, in case people care. I had trapper and phagocyte. On the first day I think I just extracted 3 times and ate two of the spores (I forgot to count that Jin Su had extracted one already) and on the second day I extracted 4 times again (that's what you get for slow research), trapped the engine room, RAS and IB and finally spiked Andie after they had set off the trap. On the third day on C8 I went to remove the BD shower, spiked Andie and spiked them again on C1 due to bacteria being done. Andie was worried about me walking through IB a lot, but it didn't seem to alarm anyone else. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/cool.gif" alt=":anim_cool:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Sure, I didn't do anything that interesting, but I play for results, and that's what I got. <strong>EDIT</strong> I tried to kill Hua to get rid of the only tech to ensure you would never get Pilgred done. You should really have relayed me more! I got my wish, even if she did live.</p>

                <p>Heh. Sadly, I do have to agree that we were slow on almost everything. Barely any Projects (1 completed only at the Nexus), antispore was done...mid 2nd day I think? Even the much mentioned mush communication channel wasn't completed, although that can be noted to Andie being a mush at that point.</p><p>Raluca, when you rampaged, you were lucky that Kuan Ti woke up EXACTLY that cycle, and made us focus on him being suddenly alive. We thought you did something, but not that extent.<br>I even messaged Andie, thinking that it might have been a transfer as it was so weird, but that would have required two people to play. Shame, that it was the time of his turning.<br>Other problem was that I honestly didn't know we were so slow on the antispore gas and you could have extracted that horrible amounts of spores to trap. Sure, I though you may have had enough to spore another person, but that much? Eh, another thing to chalk up to inactivity. (Funny thing to remember that Paola took biologist, yet never used it I think.)</p><p>About pilgred: I think most people had bad experiences with pilgred rush, and it's preety much preferred to make it stay under 50%. If we had relayed you once more, I think you could have easily returned us to sol with Andie to help.<br>Sure, this was also our demise, but hey, it's a risk I have taken, to hope we can do it with a technician. Well...no. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
