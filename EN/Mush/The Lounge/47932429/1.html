                <p>I was alpha Mush Chao, with a Finola mush partner. T.E.R.R.E.N.C.E. Unit was aboard.</p><p>This is the first time I've ever created an AP thread, because I believe a lot on this ship warrants explanation. Most of all, how an alpha Mush killed two mush.</p><p>I was the last to wake up on the ship on D2C5 and had Finola as a partner. No matter how many times I PMed her, I never received a response, though she had, on rare occasions, posted elsewhere in the main threads. I accepted the fact that I must work alone.</p><p>Luckily, an opportunity presented itself: Kuan Ti had dirty an inordinate amount of times, and was highly suspicious. I had managed to spore him twice, but with his suspicious activity even as a human, I knew that he would be a risky conversion, so I pegged him for a patsy. I convinced the humans he was mush, and while Stephen and myself were killing him, gave him the final spike that would convert him, took anonymush, and watched as the mush count went to one dead, one alive.</p><p>Finola went about her business, sporing occasionally and spiked inactive Frieda once. She never once helped with research and remained dirty cycle after cycle, guaranteeing her mush-hood. Eventually, she started taking spores (and holding onto them) that I desperately needed for other purposes and not killing her was going to make me look suspicious, as the human mush-murdering machine I was supposed to be, so I had to kill my partner. I did at least convince the humans to print the list: Chao, Finola, Gioele, and Raluca remained on it.</p><p>I was alone again, in a body that was amazingly AP deprived, with no access to phagocyte, as my skill slots were full. I knew my days were numbered before someone realized I wasn't getting AP from food or when I would miscount my morale.</p><p>I planned to make a partner. Stephen, whom I knew was an active, reliable player, was on a mission with me. I was fully ready to convert him after, armed with two spores for C8, and free spore from fertile for C1. Then, RNGesus began his aggressive persecution of me for my mushy ways.</p><p>Stephen became lost and died on the expo. The very next zone I got hit with a disease, a disease I knew I wouldn't have upon landing. I grabbed the medikit upon landing, healed the other explorers, and ran as fast as i could to bridge to the move the ship and to log off quickly, feigning forgetting to drop the medikit. I knew this was insanely risky and expected to be dead by morning. By a miracle, I was alive.</p><p>I knew I needed another patsy, so I double spored Raluca when given the opportunity. She died of depression before I could finish her. Another lost opportunity. I decided instead to start taking out valuable targets and double spored Janice on D9C2, with the intent of converting her D10. She, of course, signed online and became active and scanned herself right after. Thank you for that timing, Janice. Now the crew, who already had me on a list of suspects (in the mush hunt thread that I started), were looking for who could have spored Janice and when. I knew my time was limited. The last suspect before Hua and then myself on the murder list, Roland, had died of Starvation.</p><p>D11, I had done the math. The hull was getting low. Techs were the best opportunity to weaken the crew, as only the TERRENCE Unit remained, along with a tech book Paola was holding. I quickly converted Janice, then killed TERRENCE and Paola and read the book to deprive any hope of PILGRED. I watched as fires bloomed and hunters arrived, while the remaining human crew (Gioele, Chun, Ian, and Hua) worked to kill my new partner, who had two missions worth of AP waiting on her. All she had to do was sign online, and we could have killed at least two more of the humans, hoping the others would die of morale loss.</p><p>Well, as luck had had it all along in my doomed journey, Janice never returned. Gioele finally killed us both off, with Janice never having made a single mushy move this cycle.</p><p>I was Chao, the Mush island, and I weep at my lost NERON expulsion that I worked so hard to get. The ship is still going, so I can only hope that it gets destroyed before they can complete PILGRED. Rest in pieces, dear humans.</p><p>-Lonely Chao</p>

                <p>Hey! Was Paola.</p><p>The ship was good, the people nice, and we lasted quite a long time.</p><p>Terrence was fun. Chao was (seemed^^) efficient, most people were active.</p><p>I had fun, even if having to stay almost all the time on the bridge did not allow me to mush hunt (I'm not very good at it anyway!)</p><br><p>Chao, you did a good job at surviving. The only thing I regret is you using IRL excuses after that disease on exploration. All the "It was late, I had to go to sleep, nobody was connected" part is quite weak to get out of it.</p><p>Anyways, my best game on the english mush!</p><p>see you in another life, guys.</p>

In my defense, In those cases I was either 1) at work (most often) or, in the case of the medikit, I actually did sign off to go to bed (It was 1 AM my time). The only thing I did was "forget" to drop the medikit.</p><p>I try not to use real life cases unless they are apt, i.e. I'm actually going to bed. Otherwise, people always assume that RL 'excuses' are lies for mush which sets a dangerous precendence.</p>
