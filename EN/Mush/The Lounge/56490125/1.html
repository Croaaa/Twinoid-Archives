                <p>The Ship That Would Not Die!</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"> Now you can yell at the salty old lady, haha. I got places to be, so this will be the shorter summary.</p><p>I want to make very clear that pretty much everyone in the crew made tragic mistakes - I sure did - but the point is how many of them we got away with. (This last one is probably on me, but it might be the pilots. I'm not even sure anymore.)</p><p>When I boarded I thought there would be more people! I'd jumped wrong! That was the bad news. The good news was Janice was rushing around making fave threads. <em>And she was gold.</em> I thought, this might be fun! I made my very first Astropad, and linked everyone to Mushpedia. Even playing field.</p><p>Every player except maybe... Paola? Answered in the skills thread. Then 2/3s of them fell silent. Jin Su wobbled around for a while then slept the long sleep. Andie couldn't be removed from the Nexus (though Terrence was using her, tsk) and the one person who could kick her out was also a dorm lump. The most distressing part was that Janice fell silent. Now, I've fallen silent before (like, a tree fell on our power lines, once. Then I got cussed out in final report. Whoops.) So I get it, RL can interfere. But with so many inactives, it felt very Mushy.</p><p>What Janice did, though, was gift us with pushing CPU Overclocking. I thought, ok! That's my bonus, I'll bump it then go to the front where Chun was struggling with lichen Ian (lots of people watered but it wasn't enough.) So it was likely pure chance that I saw and reported the next project: PLASMA SHIELD.</p><p>I thought when I picked the Frieda the old ice cream truck that all I'd do was scan for planets. From my POV, CPU Overclocking was our first big save. Because I got two multizone planets [will post screenies later] and I got a doozy on my first try. Hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons. Orchard. OXYGEN.</p><p>Then I became Commander. Jin Su had slipped into his big boy pajamas. I could no longer help Chun with Research. As I recall, I could barely crawl to Icarus Bay. Now, Paola didn't talk to anyone - I tried to whisper to her - but she did her job. Ate some food, did Comms, went away. Even though sometimes she had the AP to help Chun in the Lab. There was nothing. She was suspected after a few more rounds of this. At one point she left the empty bridge with sofa to sleep in the dorms. (In the end she flew off to Front Bravo Turret and died there. I guess she liked the fake sofa more than the real one?)</p><p>So we were down to 14 shield (I think?), our oxygen was low, and we had finally made it to the planet. I could barely count the dots to keep the pilots on-board for all the inactives. Plasma Shield was still not done. Nothing in the Lab was done. I had the awful uncharitable thought that maybe Janice could be kicked into Icarus Bay if Stephen weren't asleep - would that be legal? Could I ask in Q&amp;A? I did my duty and went to Icarus Bay to perhaps, I dunno, die.</p><p>Then behold, a wild Janice appears! She was low on morale but relayed everything, turned off pilot lock, and joined me in IB. I very nearly did not have enough AP to even launch us, it was SO close. This was Cycle 3, I believe. I had a choice, go before or after the cycle. It was so lucky I went right before, because I learned then that hunters respawn the following cycle. Go figure! So with just us two, I started the Expo. It would be a fun girls-only death!</p><p>What happened was the greatest Expo I have ever done ever. I will talk about it later. But it was great. I still can't believe it. Oxygen was replenished. Fuel. We had 3 alien fruits and like 9 steaks. A caterpillar fell on me and a skinner tried to hug me but I was alive! I left IB quicklike, dragging my old lady bones with as much meat as I could carry. My life is stressful, okay.</p><p>The next rebel base was Kaladaan! Maybe clockwork Paola would also solve our morale shortage.</p><p>Then Plasma Shield was completed!</p><p>And it was not turned on.</p><br><br><p><em>I'll leave you here, gumdrops, because I really do have to jet, but for my own note, I did learn that the Command console will still give you an option to waste 1 AP on moving when there's an Arack, and you can have too many hydropots, and apparently I can talk otherwise sensible people into surviving way past our expiration date.</em></p>

                <p>Ay there mate. Eleesha here. When I first joined, I thought, "Hmm, no one plays eleesha, and she is always inactive. Let's change that up!" And so it was indeed a change. A wopping 9 people fell inactive throughout the entire ship, though 3 of those 9 either fell inactive at the very end or woke up sometime in the middle of the ship. How fortunate of us that those 9 were all human! The two mushes on the ship did not do much damage fortunately, with me ridding of Hua soon after selection and then offing KT when he stopped being useful. Gioele, our commander due to Jin Su becoming a potato, had intense difficulty in following directions and did many significantly suspicious things, and so was stabbed by me so that the reliable Granny could take charge (note that I was the only person to murder anyone on the ship). In the very end, 5 people remained to repair pilgred, maintain the garden, deal with RNJesus, and deal with hunters. Chun fell inactive though, and Roland was blatantly oblivious to what he should have been doing (SHOOT THE ARACKS NOT THE REGULAR HUNTERS), so really it was more of a 3 man stand. Granny was tied with gardening and maintaining the front of the ship while I was tied maintaining the lower half while Terrence tried his best to shuffle pilgred repairs and hunters. In the end, we blew up by an asteroid. A sad end, but really we should have ended 5 days before.</p>
