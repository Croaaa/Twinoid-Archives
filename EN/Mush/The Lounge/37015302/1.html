                <p>Stephen here. I think day 20 was perfect date to arrive Eden, because we already had problems with activity at this date and we have no goal except boring surviving. By the way, It was my third ship and first MMM. I think I will take a break until next season (or next MMM). Developers of "Mush" really need to add some new goals to play after all researches and projects done, starmap pieces found (we had 6 <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">).</p>

                <p><strong><em>MUSH HUNT JOURNAL of Eleesha the Bloodthirster</em></strong></p><p><strong>- - Beginnings - -</strong></p><p>I was the Eleesha on this ship.</p><p>The ship started out incredibly active, except for our Chao, our Frieda, (who did nothing, and didn't participate in anything but complained about our complaining when she didn't scan anything), and Gioele.</p><p>Being Eleesha, I had to make sure to kill the mush and track them down like the ruthless mycoterrorists that they were. Since our second shower was disassembled right from the start, I grabbed the medkit and started standing next to the shower.</p><p><strong>- - Mush's First Death, and the Dead Navigator - -</strong></p><p>Lo and behold. Janice and Chao already had damage at day 1 cycle 1. Talk about alarm bells ringing!</p><p>Instead of killing them both outright (which was my inclination), I created a thread telling people to report how they got damaged, and why. I was very hesistant to kill Janice because she is such an important member, but I could not wait to kill the Chao.</p><p>I was pissed at Chao for a long time. He was a gold player, and had shooter, wrestler, and torture. BUT HE DID NOT DO ANYTHING FOR THREE DAYS!! No torture, no research, he just stood there for a handful of cycles at a time and then exited and returned to the dorm with no explanation why.</p><p>I was super eager to murder him and spread his entrails all over the dormitory floor as a grim testament to any player not doing his job.. but instead of risking the ire of the crew, I decided to wait for the climate to become more supportive of the idea of a dead Chao.</p><p>So while trying to spread suspicion about Chao, the people on the bridge, particularly our Jin Su, started getting very pissed off at our Frieda. I took this opportunity to bathe in her less than productive blood and exfoliate in her entrails. The crew had mixed reactions about this.</p><p>That was okay, because now we had rounded out who the mush could have been based on our sheer levels of productivity: Chao, Gioele, Janice, Raluca.</p><p>Janice was vital to our ship however, so we did not kill her. Raluca was compliant and active on the chat, plus we needed her for pilgred.. so it left us with Gio and Chao.</p><p>As the ship went on, the crew became more and more open to the idea of dead Chao on the menu. It finally culminated on our mush hunt chat with Chao discovering a hidden myco-alarm and then saying nothing about it. I was on the hunt, and so asked our Roland to help me kill Chao.</p><p>We found Chao in the dorm. Roland was hesitant, he was like "what do we do now?".. I encouraged him to kill. Kill until there is no more killing left to be done. Neither of us could have done it alone, so I delivered the killing blow. and we rejoiced at our lazy dead adversary.</p><br><p><strong>- - Traitorous Mush Makes his Mark In Blood - -</strong></p><br><p>The second mush however was proving difficult for us to find. I mean, Gioele was our main suspect, but he claimed to be a beginner. I was very hesitant to kill a beginner and so was the rest of the ship. He just acted dumb and I was actually thinking about killing one of the other members because its such a damnable thing to kill a beginner just because they didn't know what to do.</p><p>This all backfired after we acquired the serum. I finally gathered up enough guts to kill Gio, and stood in the lab with him. At the very moment I was to kill Gio, Ian comes in the door. and then I don't realize that all my :pa: is not out the door. I go offline.</p><p>And then when I return, to my horror, Gio went on a rampage and killed our beloved Commander. We managed to kill him.</p><p><strong>- - Eleesha's Final Remorse - -</strong></p><p>I felt bad.. very bad. I should have went with my gut and killed the lazy Gio instead of taking pity on a supposed beginner. The whole crew counted on me to kill the mush, but I couldn't bear to do it just because someone was a "newbie"... Never again will this happen.</p><p>It was then at that moment that I could no longer print the list.</p>

I am so glad we made it to Eden. I can now stop staring at that screen scanning for planets! Sorry about the ship - it really was a bit of a rush job and I'm just happy it lasted the distance. Apologies for all the steel plates that fell of the ceiling. Hope you're all enjoying your stay on Eden!</span></span></p><br><br><p>Well done everyone - we really worked together well and it was the best crew I've had so far. Really enjoyable trip. I think going any longer would have dragged a bit, and the fires were starting to get a bit out of control. Still, got to #48 on the ranking - and made the third highest Kuan Ti, so I'm pretty pleased with that!</p>

                <p>I played Finola on this ship, and actually knew Chun's player from somewhere else. I talked to her regularly, so it was pretty entertaining watching her flail whenever she was trying to guess if I was Mush.</p><p>Since this was MMM, my goal from the beginning of the game was to try and research the serum and hope that one of the Mush would be found quickly, so we could cure them and they could come to Eden with us. Of course, that didn't happen, partially to me researching too much and making it hard to find them. Oops?</p><p>Somehow, I ended up playing Finola as pretty anti-social. This might've been partly due to the fact that I got insanely bored after Jin Su died. At that point, there wasn't any more relaying being done. I couldn't research and there was little activity. I was frustrated for a while and may or may not have been secretly hoping that I would get lost on an expo. Activity did pick up later, when we found the third Starmap Fragment, and I finally enjoyed playing again.</p><p>I really did have fun with you guys and am kind of upset that the server wouldn't let me like any crew members days after the ship ended. Apologies for awkward roleplaying on my end!</p>

                <p>Hello everyone! I am yours beloved psychologist Janice! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"><br>I’m very glad that I got on same ship with you! It was very fun! We lived for 20 days as a family and I think that it was one of the most beautiful journeys so far! <br>Also, Roland, Terrence, Raluca, Eleesha, Kuan Ti, Stephen, Finola and Chun. You are my favorites! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"> &lt;3<br>I’m glad to tell everyone that I have a Space Journal. I will post first part to this thread.<br>And if you like it I will post more.</p><p><strong>Janice Space Journal</strong><br>I am starting to write this Journal to help myself on researching people’s behavior in extreme situation in space. All crew will synchronize their period of activity with Neron cycles. But I will try to avoid mentioning Neron’s dates. Since after work with it I know that “feeling” of time of AI is quite different from human. And in long periods of space travel it will dramatically differ from earth’s time.</p><p><strong>Note 1</strong><br>Neron initiated “wake up” protocol and people started quickly filled the laboratory. It seems that Raluca dragged a cat with her. Despite the fact that was done because of personal motives of our genius girl, I think that the cat can help with boosting moral of the crew. <br>During transportation of Schrödinger to the dorm I found out that it have a bad temper. I got some scratches and bites but holding this fluffy animal made me feel more relaxing. Don’t think that someone can handle “a long conversation“ with the cat, except Raluca. But it will help for once.<br>After whole crew was awoken, Neron announced that two crewmembers were infected by Mush. Eleesha confirmed those worries. To help my team I will try to use my knowledge of psychology to hunt down infected crewmembers.</p><p><strong>Note 2</strong><br>According to Neron’s calculation on the “day one” our research team led by Fiola managed to reduce spore productivity by Mush and increase resistance of the crew to the infection. With help of Paola we managed to get Plasma Shield upgrade of Neron. This project was abandoned on Sol as the most difficult one and it’s seems that someone finished it during our long sleep. Those two events have led to the incredible rise of the spirit all people on the ship. Which allowed me to spend some time on studying works devoted to the behavior of infected.<br>It seems that Mush infection making humans immune to most of the illnesses including psychological and stress. In other hand, humans in such extreme situation as ours will be affected by a great stress and in a long term by psychological problems. To accelerate onset of symptoms of certain crewmembers I will avoid them till symptoms become obvious to everyone. The consequences can be critical but it can save them live.</p><p><em> The list: </em><br>Wang Chao – great expert in the “special operations”. Was very active before cryogenic sleep but not after it. His hyperactivity will help me to control his psychological state since it hard for him to get benefits from the group therapy. <br>Raluca Tomescu – her antisocial behavior will lead to suspicion from all of the team. I need to prove that she is human as soon as possible. It can save her life. She also can’t get any benefits from group therapy and I can easily predict her psychological condition at any time.<br>Jiang Hua – after cryogenic sleep Hua is silently carrying her tasks. She can’t talk or keep the conversation well. Her state can be easily described as biological robot behavior. This can be dictated by minor brain injury or the Mush infection. <br>Gioele Rinaldo – active businessman and owner of the ship. Now he is behaving himself as a vegetable. He is incapable to talk and act most of time. Such condition can be caused by serious brain injury or mush infection. <br>Stephen Seagull – the most mysterious person of the crew. Since I can’t easily to describe his psychological portrait I will include him in this list.</p><p>Gathered data about these people will be transferred to our commander Jin Su and main mush hunter Eleesha. Both of them managed to prove themselves as humans and this information will certainly help them.</p><p><em>To be continued?.. </em></p>
