                <p>Wasn't sure which forum to post this in but guess this is the right one. Anyway a few weeks ago I was in a ship that after mush rampage had no techs, no pilots and low oxygen. In desperation myself (Stephen), Chao and Chun went to a planet with O2 and a Mankarog to try and keep us alive long enough to fix Pilgred. Unfortunately we weren't able to fix Pilgred and the ship blew up but it inspired me to write this about the trip to the planet.</p><p><em>The three crewmembers scrambled across the arid, red landscape of the alien world towards the safety of the Icarus. The ground vibrated every few seconds causing them to stumble with each step of the gargantuan Mankarog descending on them.<br><br>They pulled up short as they reached a steep, treacherous decline that went down about one hundred metres. Two hundred metres past that sat their flight back to the Daedalus. The mankarog would be on them in a minute or so catching them way before they negotiated the descent in front of them. <br><br>Chun turned to the men by her side wiping away the sweat and hair plastered to her brow and leaving a muddy red smear that contrasted against her pale, alabaster skin. Despite the situation her voice was steady as she spoke. 'Well that's it. It's over' she gestured to the bulky backpack filled with the vital oxygen that Chao was carrying. 'I feel bad that our deaths at the hand of this thing will be quick compared to the asphyxiation our colleagues will suffer' she said.<br><br>Chao knelt down easing off the backpack as the often quiet and stoic Stephen looked at the gargantuan monster stomping inexorably towards them. 'Maybe Stephen can kill it' he stated which if nothing else managed to get a stifled nervous giggle from Chun. 'I think this is even beyond your means' she replied serenely.<br><br>Chao stood back up and placed both hands on Chun's shoulders in a gentle gesture completely at odds with his normally violent nature. For a moment they maintained eye contact then as Chun opened her mouth to speak he spun her around, hauled the oxygen pack on her back and said. 'You are humanity's last hope' before unceremoniously shoving her off the edge. With a scream she began tumbling and bouncing down the hill and towards the ship.<br><br>Stephen and Chao watched her for a moment before turning to each other and Stephen nodded in agreement. 'You are the Captain. You go. Stephen will hold it back' Stephen said in his broken English. Chao smiled while drawing his wickedly serrated knife into his left hand and with practiced ease licked along the edge testing it's sharpness just enough to draw blood. 'I'm a monster Stephen, I kill and I torture people and I enjoy it. I'm no leader of men, fix Pilgred and lead them back to Sol'.<br><br>As he finished talking Chao lunged forward and Stephens vision burst into swimming black stars and revolving ground. It took him a moment to realise Chao had caught him with a right hook sending him over the edge and falling after Chun. The Russian stowaway landed at the bottom of the descent in a crumpled heap. He painfully sat upright, looking up in time to see the huge alien filling the horizon. Silhouetted against it was the tiny shape of Chao his knife in one hand and a blaster in the other. For a moment everything was still as the Mankarog stared at the human barring it's path.<br><br>'MOVE YOUR ASS STEPHEN' Chun's shout from the embarking ramp broke the tableau causing Stephen to lurch to his feet as a monstrous roar shook the air and the high pitched whine of a blaster on full auto started up. Stephen began to stumble to the ship as fast as he could.<br><br>'Dosvedanya brother' <br></em></p><br><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_8353852 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8353852">pimpernel</span> was Chun and <span class="tid_user tid_user_1763047 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1763047">Draink</span> Chao so thank you both and everyone else on that ship for the fun ride. Sometimes it's the ships where everything is going wrong that are far more fun than the ones where everything is going right.</p>
