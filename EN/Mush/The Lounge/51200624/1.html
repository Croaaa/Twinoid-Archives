                <p>Alright! Lets start Part 1 of this story! I must warn you that this was a 20 day ship filled with a ton of micromanagement and pre-planning. I have forgotten a lot of the early game, hopefully other members can fill in.</p><p>The ship started different from any other ship. I was trying to jump with fellow TE members, they all had Chun in their selection so I decided I would take the dive. I woke up as Chun on D1C1, alone. They didn't match my ship. I did a bit of inventory while the ship SLOWLY filled. Izpodtishka and Fennec eventually were able to get in, then a few other TE I didn't expect.</p><p>My rp was a bit different from most Chuns. I started with the cliche "I'm a nice and caring person" kind but, underneath, she was only doing it to get what she wanted. She was actually a psychopath, fairly uncaring, and completely insane! You'll find out why later... I saw the personalities pop in and the ship was EXTREMELY active! I knew it was either going to be a very hard ship or a very easy one depending...</p><p>Selection happens. I rush around looking for weapons to hide/grab. Paola had grabbed the grenade and Eleesha had grabbed the knife. I immediately asked for their locations. I found the knife in RC and Paola said she was still carrying the grenade. I decided to allow her to hold onto it. Sure she could've been mush but, if she wasn't, then the mush would probably never get a hold of it (Paola isn't known for being a prime target). I hid blasters when I was able to, kept the knife on me and picked up my armor.</p><p>A day passed, research was fairly active with little help from me (inventory can drain a lot from you). I had medlab bed as a lethargic Chun. My preparations were still on doing whatever I can to prevent a rampage. Derek was standing in the refectory, alone. Given the fast research and unprotected powerhouse, I decided I would contact the most trusted tech, Terrence. Raluca was helpful but it's always difficult to predict a Raluca mush since she's so hard to watch. Kuan Ti was... Messy... We'll get to that soon, though. So I contact Terrence and arrange a meeting in CAT where I would hand off my armor to him. I'm the kind of Chun that sees little value in protecting myself. MOH dies and the ship can still crutch home with a tech but if the techs die then the ship's chance of winning drops tremendously (besides, people usually assume Chun is protected, hence the secrecy).</p><p>Terrence was quick to go the turret at the start of the cycle and I quickly unite with him and hand him the armor... Then I waited for him to leave... And waited... And waited... Damnit Terrence go already! Finally he does and I happily start making my way back to medlab. When I got to CC I saw Stephen had arrived there just a moment ago. Oh okay. I'm going to check if he's dirty real quick. Hm, not dirty. I refresh and... <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/rgrLzbP.png?1">this</a> happens. I didn't even hesitate, I ran in, ate a ration, and ran out. To think, I would NEVER have caught this if Terrence wasn't dragging his feet (literally and figuratively).</p><p>Our first mush was dead (poor unlucky Stephen). The crew was more than a little confused at the sudden death of a crewmate. It was difficult to explain its simplicity and sheer randomness. The commander presented me with a <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/Bu5QriO.png?1">reward</a>. I then became known as a yoga master (master of the not-move-for-half-of-a-day-on-the-bed pose) and ultra ninja!</p>

                <p>Paola here.<br>I suspected that so many people from one casting was not a coincidence, but I didn't realize that you actually tried to jump on this ship together. So this wasn't exactly a random ship, and that explains a lot.<br>As for Stephen, it was an extremely lucky timing for you, Chun, to enter on exactly the moment he decided to extract a spore and then finish him with a single strike. And that luck was with us until the very end.<br>I can't add much to the story at this point, as I hardly recall the early days too, and I was not very active and attentive. I actually chose to play Paola, because I wanted a quiet and short ship without too much online needed. But the game decided otherwise.<br>Waiting for the next part of the story</p>

                <p>Eleesha here. Not much to add to the story as most of the background decisions were handled by the casting members (Chun, Jin su, Janice), so I just went with it and tried to do my best. Eleesha was the last character to choose and glad I did, else I wouldn't have received my first Eden. Thanks again guys <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Howdy, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/jinsu.png" alt=":mush_jin_su_50:" class="tid_ico"> Jin Su here!</p><p>Sorry for taking so long - I've been a tad busy lately. So. Guess, it's my turn for a part 1 now (-: And yeah, I forgot most of the stuff by now too, but luckily I have some screenshots that should help to solve the problem (-8</p><p>So yeah, we were trying to jump together with a bunch of friends, but my selection was stubbornly revolting for several days in a row (moreover, trying to forcefeed me with all the characters I don't like :V), but eventually I got a nice set and a match with Fennec, and the coices looked like a middle-filled ship, which could've been BB's. So I've just jumped, hoping it would be so, aaaaand luckily it was <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>From the first sight ship seemed pretty quiet just as usual, but as soon as the blabbering started, more people got involved and the rest of the days were far from being called "quiet" :3 And even though plenty of people were more like once-a-day players, they were yet comminicative and cooperative, which was the main reason we managed to get where we did.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>So. People were waking up, showing what they're made of step by step, and feeling each other out.. best times for a commander to study his crew! And well, he just couldn't help but notice that sassy chinese nurse, whom he kinda knew already from the earlier years, but definitely in another light. Even before the last cryo-tubs were emptied, he already made his mind up and only waited for a right moment and excuse.. Hum... <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/DNAsawt.png">yoga</a>, you were saying?..<br>(Oh, and <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/9sPDHNc.jpg">Paola's appearance</a> on board also was quite helpful in all the following team-building, I must note <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> And thanks a lot for keeping up all the fun <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/PJwxaNO.jpg">banter </a>during the whole ship further on &lt;3)<br>Since we once already went through a Chun+JS couple with BadBlanket, and it.. err.. ended up in a rather tragical story, we were planning to be more careful this time. Buuuuuut.. welp, still got caught in a bad romance pretty soon anyways XD I had to nip into Medlab to drop blasters for Ms Chief Security Officer soon after the selection and <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/wfDqoiU.jpg">this </a>happened.</p><p>So yeah, Jin Su was a son of an illusionist (who was making some extra money on the side as a clown from time to time since his.. illusions didn't have much success among audience, yeah). He has learned some thingies from his father in childhood (but eh.. some complexes also stayed with him since those early years and he stressed out a bit every time someone didn't take him seriously or questioned his authority) and once even showed Janice <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/KKhuLIw.jpg">one of his own tricks</a> (and was going to entertain Eleesha a bit too and even made a special trick for her, but she ran away before he even pulled out his majic hat, heh). Too bad I never managed to make a full-version perfomance for the crew, but micro-management ate almost all of my free time =P And besides that, Chun wasn't very happy when she felt like someone was trying to take away what belonged to her, so Jin Su always had to be careful with showing attention to the female part of the crew.. umm.. and male.. and.. and also <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/Nxdn5zL.jpg">ghosts</a>..</p><p>Their relationship started up <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/SF8j8Rc.jpg">quite innocently</a>, but after one of the first expos, when everything went totally not as he planned AGAIN, Jin Su was awfully <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/z1XZEm1.png">mad</a> and refused performing his duty further on, <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/Io2V2mQ.png">handling all the power to Chun</a>, and thus invoke her inner dominatrix (heh, of course it wasn't related much, but let's not tell him that, okay? =P)</p><p>From then on things started evolving much faster and in a completely different direction.. colors.. and shapes.. That, of course, will mostly stay between Chun and Jin Su only, but I just can't not boast of the rad private collection (<a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/ySdc9nl.jpg">as for D12</a>) we managed to create and keep safe most of the time during the whole voyage.. In outer space! And far away from civilization, mind you! Despite all the <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/NuaEUwo.jpg">fires </a>and curious (and harmful &gt;:V) onlookers, trying to steal themselves an item now and then. Hrmph! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"><br>(And yes, everything was important there and had it's own intended use, except for the microwave and other kitchen stuff, of course. And no, we had just one dril and dirty old t-shirt, but I'm too lazy to edit the screenshots)</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Oh! And here goes a little tasty bonus! Which is, as always, a credit to <span class="tid_user tid_user_8281990 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8281990">Kobb</span>'s awesome creativity!<br>So I was hanging out in a Refectory most of the time after freeing Medlab bed for the research lady. And we had all of the fruit production boosting stuff (Extra Pots+Lamps+Incubator). Aaaaaaand Paola got a Pneumatic distributor as one of her early updates. So every morning Jin Su had to wake up to <a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/a/oufcP#2">this </a><img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> (First time I saw a 20+ messages right after daychange, I almost pooped myself though, to be honest)<br>Bananas were replaced by jumpkins quite soon and the <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/VM1nQBO.png">consequences </a>of the daily fruit storm became much more serious, hehe</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>That's it for now, will continue soonish though (left the Frieda part for dessert, yus =P)</p>

                <p>Oh! forgot to mention earlier, but captain's little breakdowns were partly Janice's personal credits. That heartless beast definitely was up to some kind of <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/eH8DA4m.jpg">psychological experiments</a> on Jin Su. That was one of the points on which she started getting along well with the crazy drone-fixed technician, with whom they later formed a disgusting perverted <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/trUM3lL.jpg">swan match</a> (as opposed to our perfectly normal healthy relationship)..<br>...a match, that later turned into a triangle..<br>....a triangle.. transforming into... a quadrangle..</p><p>But hey!
