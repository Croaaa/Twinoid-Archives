                <p>Hey all, Mush Janice from this ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3597" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3597</a></p><p>This was a weird weird ship and frankly I'm feeling kind of hang dog that you guys made it back to sol with the cure despite the insanity of some of the human gameplay after my death and related to that planet. Like 4 humans suicided -after- I was gone, there were the 2 inactives, people largely disagreed about strategies and plans and goals - and you still pulled it together and got both Pilgred and the cure from 0 to finished in like 8 cycles, even while attempting to do the most borked expo ever, one that involved loss of the Icarus and it's sole pilot Roland, loss of whatever ship Jin Su took for expo, with it breaking while he was in space, then his ejection from that ship, and Frieda's finishing the zones in a second little ship. There were people who felt you had to leave orbit right away, people who wanted to do more planet scanning and find more air.... heck the game even gave you another very safe O2 planet on the first set of analysis!</p><p>So despite all these distractions, critical rule breaking suicides, tight time pressure, people unable to be online at the same times.... you all still got Pilgred done and the cure too and got yourselves back to Sol.</p><p>Now, in the end page Jin claims that he was hacked or mod controlled and forcibly ejected from his fighter. For sure he made a message in third person immediately before the suicide, but that was really quite weird. I feel comfortable that no mod would touch the game in any fashion; I don't know about hacking, but I am confused about one thing - That planet and who found the air.</p><p>See, that planet had 6 zones. And Roland went down to it, alone, with low health, and died pretty early. I couldn't quite watch the timing, because I was there from my end page, having not commented yet, watching the announces. But the time from Chun's comment about Roland having gone down solo to Roland's death message I thought was 17 minutes. That's enough time for 2 zones, leaving 4 - but I'm not certain of the timing.</p><p>However, Jin went down in a fighter or the Pasiphae; Those ships explore 3 zones. Jin said he didn't see the O2 zone... that leaves 1 zone.</p><p>Frieda went down in a fighter or the Pasiphae, but she reported <strong>2</strong> expo gains, both a single steak. Her ship did manage to land (Jin's was stuck in space and never landed), and O2 didn't automagically appear.</p><p>That makes 7 zones, but the planet was reported to only have 6. No one had any U-turn skill, so... Jin did you lie about not getting the O2 zone? Cause the only way that Frieda could have gotten 2 zones was if Roland only reached one zone. Roland died, and you cannot die in an O2 zone, so....</p><p>Where did the O2 go?</p><p>Good job succeeding in psyching me about the cure. When I was sitting in bravo dorm with my ceasefire going, the only thing I was afraid of was the finish of the cure. I didn't know if you guys had the disk or not, and when you started to gather in the lab, even after having walked around other places first (like to come visit me)... well I believed that you were gathering to rush the cure.</p><p>I had a plan, but sadly it required one more cycle. Just one, and for me not to move until that cycle changed. I threw that plan away because of fear of you guys actually rushing the cure and sticking me with it.... I so so so hoped I could grab your disk and abscond with it. Couldn't even do that. I won't discuss my plan, it might have been effective and I might use it a next time.</p><p>This was my first time being alpha mush and <em>not</em> berserking and rushing after selection. Ironically my partner did, this time. And without much communication with me.... he answered my strategy discussion with an 'I'm sorry, but I'm not going to be very active this game', and then without another word to me, not even an offer to berserk together, let alone asking who I might want to see spiked once before he goes down... he attacked Chun and failed to kill her. Chun didn't fail to kill him, she one shotted him on her first counterattack after he used all his possible attacks on her.</p><p>That Chun man, she was lucky. I fired six shots at her, 4 hit, and I only got her down to 8 health. And bruised my shoulder on the 6th try, making further shots with the blaster very unlikely to hit.</p><p>Meanwhile, one of the humans punching me, through mush armor and without solid or wrestler, managed a 3 health loss strike. So much for armor giving -1 to the damage you take.</p><p>I'm sorry for your griefing humans, humans, though I cheered them on at the time. I hope you had some fun, I kinda did.</p><p>I'm aware that at least one of you was asking on the questions forum about some suspicions of playing against the team by myself and Chun. Lets discuss that here if you would? Explain your concerns, and I'll explain reality. As I view it, you're concerned, and you will not actually get answers yourself except from me and possibly Chun, so lets talk. I don't need to talk to any of the judges who will view the ship logs and decide if I played against my team or not, because that's not going to be a problem - I didn't. And I don't believe Chun did either.... though I also didn't believe you guys could pull off Pilgred repair and Sol without a lot of luck, and you guys had anti-luck in the form of 4 suicides and an utterly borked 02 expo when air was already very low.... for all that the RNG was very, very, very much a human this game for the most part. Seriously, RNG? Throw a mush a bone occasionally?.... But yeah. Discuss your concerns and suspicions about 'what happened between Janice and Chun' if you wish, and I'll answer them as best I can. I suspect Chun will explain herself too if asked.</p>

                <p>Well after you died we wne tfor the oxygen. I think Frieda lied about that planet. I think this was a wierd game. Maybe a buggy game. But when I was down there there were 6 zones, and 1 was oxygen. And I never reached it. Maybe Frieda lied about going down there because I found 2 steaks. And after I died I felt bad. I wanted back in. I wanted to help them. See us through. But no such luck. I felt bad for Chun who thought I was good. I didn't suicide. I am still trying to get a mod to tell me what happened.<br>Chun was the best on this ship by far. Chun played for thier team. Anyone who thinks not is blind or has an IQ lower than a turnip. I'll miss talking to Chun, and a few of the other people. Time to go back to wandering around terrible random ships for another month. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"></p>

A mush who was in a patrol ship died in the exact same way, with the same message in the third person. I wondered if he had ejected himself deliberately, but I don't think he did. The patrol ship had been broken because there was a fire in Bravo bay. Then the mush repaired it, while he was still out in space. The ship's hull had also been damaged by hunters. I don't know if the fire broke it again or if it exploded, but in any case, instead of dying in the destroyed ship, he was ejected and died in space.</p>

                <p>I know that in theory, if the pilot is wearing a spacesuit when the patroller is destroyed, he is ejected instead of dying. And then, apparently, he can be rescued with the Pasiphae. I suppose you weren't wearing a spacesuit, which explains why you died, since you couldn't breathe. But I don't know why you were ejected instead of dying in the patrol ship when it was destroyed.</p>

We could have if we'd have waited til C5, but that was also the cycle after which people would start suffocating, and those of us there then didn't exactly have the confidence that there would be two other people online who weren't me during C5 to relay me on the cure and hack us to Sol... so we decided to just hack then.</p><p>This was my first real ship as Chun, have to say, was a lot of fun being the information collector, but frustrating since we didn't really have active/human mush hunters on this ship. Felt so blind, staying in the lab area for research.... and even more frustrating given that I couldn't actually get our active human Finola to work on any of the anti-mush research until the cure became available at the very end, and then only a little. I'd have bet money she was mush before Janice accidentally revealed herself, what with doing useless/glory researches entirely by herself and getting dirty 3 separate times in as many days. :V</p>

                <p>Hey Rain (AKA Chun), for your first real time as Chun you did purley amazing. You acted like a Chun pro, like one of those people who refreshes for their exact character. (Ehem, I do that a bit, mostly for Jin Su or Terrence, sometimes Chao or Ian) And sorry for not knowing how to salute properly, ehm... <em>&lt;salute&gt;</em>. There we go. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Terrence here! Ah, I did wonder if you were Chun, Rain - the style seemed familiar.<br>A weird ship is how we all seem to be summing it up, and I'd have to agree. Pleased that we managed to get pilgrid &amp; the cure done in the end, it was a bit tight but we did it (thank goodness for Kuan ti!)</p><p>So many strange human players; not least of which was Finola.... I still dont 100% agree with the strategy in keeping the mush cornered &amp; alive, but it was within the rules technically, if against the spirit of the game I feel (personal opinion).</p>
