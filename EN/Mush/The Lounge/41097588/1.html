This was such a fun ship to be in with lots of activity and only 1 "Inactive"! Since the ship already ended, I'd really want an AP thread for this.</p><p>Please refer to <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5334" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5334</a> for the ship.</p><p>Not sure if one of our Betas would like to make this, but I'd like to know what happened to the ship after I sacrificed myself for Eleesha and Andie during the Defacer in the Bridge incident went wrong. Too much activity made me panic and make wrong mistakes (like choosing Trapper). I knew I was on the top of the suspect list though, so it was inevitable. xD</p><p>Anyway, Constipaspore was up even before I realized I was Alpha Mush, but at least I had enough XP to get Fertile. A few cycles later, they got Antispore. Up until now, I can't believe Gioele and I managed to get this far with our infections with me being limited to 2 skills, but the good thing is that my partner has Gold and Infector. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Our first <span class="tid_strike">beloved and deeply loved</span> beta was Andie. Both her and Janice were afk in unprotected Icarus Bay after D3-ish expedition and I got a legitimate reason to come there to freeze the steaks as per the crew's request. We figured Andie would be a better beta after the crew protected her from forgetting the apron and gaining trust by rushing Constipaspore (+ we can fake Chitchat logs when others ask). And then poof!</p><p>Our next target was Eleesha since she was too active and effective for the three of us. I was happy to know that Andie has the right skills to help with the conversion. With Gioele and Andie "afking" at Bravo Dorm, they were able to Defacer it and spike Eleesha under both the Camera and Observant. The three of us were getting too excited and nervous in our little Private Chat when Roland and Frieda woke up the cycle after that <em>and not notice the logs scrambled.</em> I think that was the point where I knew we were going to win since Eleesha has been confirmed human. &lt;3</p><p>At this point, I suggested that we convert the whole crew now that we have the main hunter in our team. Andie later informed me that both Eleesha and her has been invited to the Mush Hunt chat and told me that either Gioele or I was going to die soon. Eleesha told us that Jin Su was asking her to print the list on D5C1, so we had to convert him by then. Him being another confirmed human was just a bonus.~</p><p>Day 5 come and Eleesha and I were waiting for an opportunity to strike the Bridge. The plan was for Andie to come in the Brdige to scramble the logs and then Eleesha (with Mycelium Spirit) and I spike Jin Su to convert him. Since we thought Andie wasn't going to be online, Eleesha took the camera instead, spiked Jin Su once and leave, only to return after I spike him once so she can get Anonymush. It was too funny that Eleesha's Observant took effect even when I spiked Jin Su before she went back to the Bridge.</p><p>At this point, both Eleesha and I were probably laughing at my inevitable death. We even flooded the logs with useless stuff like reading the Commander's Manual and fixing doors and picking up stuff. I got to waste my AP doing those and building the Oscilloscope, which I had done in panic. I even laughed more irl when Andie came online just after we were finished. Moreso when Frieda came online a Cycle after and noticed the logs. <em>I wished we thought of Defacer-ing the Front Corridor logs too.</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I died, but at least I got 3/5 of the people in the mush hunt channel. I wanted to dismantle the shower before dying too, but looks like I ran out of time. Anyway, fun game everyone! Special thanks to the Gioele and the betas I had before dying! xD</p>

                <p>I like how Terrence's parting words were "boring.." even though he himself was the most boring person on board since he almost never talked, wasn't involved with the crew and even refused to communicate after we turned him Mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br> <br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"> here of course!<br> <br>I believe Janice wanted to make the AP thread after she woke up again in cycle 4 but this'll do fine I think. I'll give you my point of view up untill I got infector-spiked in Bravo Dorm:<br> <br>I was the last person to wake up on the ship and immidiately started coordinating some propper research relaying (since I wasn't Mush) by inviting Janice, Andie and Ian to a private conversation and going from there. Ian turned out to generally only be active once a day or so (and that could have cost me my life later on!) so he didn't get to participate in this early research spree. I was tracking AP usage and noted that Andie got AP from food and that Janice refused to (or couldn't) eat for some reason. Before long we had both Constipaspore and Antispore up which made me start to prepare for the likely rampage that would follow by asking that the inactive Derek be killed to prevent the Mush from transfering into him and using his skills. He didn't die untill way later though and by then it didn't matter any more.<br> <br>I had collected almost 100% of all logs on the ship and stored them in a google spreadsheet and went over them often while counting AP as I was determined to find the Mush this way (for once). As time went on and no rampage happened I started to get worried since that'd suggest that the Mush were either inactive or had the skills to cope with the early research. No one but Derek was inactive so it was probably the latter which meant it was time for some hardcore investigatin'.<br> <br>Terrence was the first target for some extensive AP investigation since he was dirty daily (some times more than once) and even went without showering for long periods of time (something that <strong>almost</strong> cost him his life). He really took the focus away from the real Mush and I hope he'll learn from that in the future. His AP checked out almost perfectly after correcting some mistakes in my AP tracking though, <em>something that made me hestitate on my next target</em> - Stephen.<br> <br>I had been suspicious of Stephen ever since the moment I saw him without any skills in one of the dorms. He was level 5 and ended up picking just <em>Apprentice</em> while claiming he was bronze. I found it very unlikely that he wasn't at least silver since he had obviously been playing for quite a while, was knowledgable about the game and I also noted that he was picking up two items regularly, suggesting that he either had an iTrackie or had discarded his tracker somewhere. He turned out to be silver later.<br> <br>I noticed that Stephen was lacking about 3 AP thanks to him claiming he was out of AP after repairing an oxygen reservoir at a time where he should have just that amount left. I figured he had Fertile and was either infecting or trapping (and I was right). I also noticed that he had taken damage but never got around to check for how much. I had been eating twice myself at this point and healed Jin Su from an illness so him and I were talking about my findings regularly but somehow never ended up doing anything about it and that right there might have cost the humans their victory. During all the investigating I had also made sure that Raluca was saving her Genius skill for Pheromodem and that Paola would get us the Genome Disk in case we suddenly got a Mush killed which would shut down any future covert conversions. It never ended up being finished.<br> <br>Gioele (gold mode with 4 skills) had been seemingly inactive ever since we asked him to move Derek to one of the storages using his Solid skill and Jin was getting impatient with him and was talking about killing him (another thing we shouldn't have hestitated with). But we ended up finally killing off Derek around day 4 or so and he was of course just human which meant that Stephen or Gioele were next on the list. Speaking of lists, it was almost time for me to print mine as well and we had agreed that we would wait for that before killing anyone else. Luckily for Mush Stephen, Gioele (and unbeknownst to all of us - Andie) they went into action just in time to stop it.<br> <br>After waking up in Day 4 cycle 5 (or so) I found myself as a beta Mush <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> for the first time in my career. Gioele and andie had converted me in Bravo Dorm under camera by using Defacer and Infector (I already had 1 spore in me from a trap so the Infector was not so important). The defacer that was used happened to be one of the bugged ones which doesn't actually delete any of the past logs, making it completely untraceable if no one notices it during the cycle its used and if none of moves from the room during it. No one did of course so now the Mush had gotten rid of their worst enemy while also gaining their biggest ally (a double confirmed human no less)! After getting over my brief disappointment I went into the fight for Mush supremacy full on and was instrumental (self flattery, I know <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">) in the continued expansion of the fungified crew on board the Daedalus.<br> <br>I'll stop my point of view (aka wall of text) here untill other people have had their chance to say anything.<br> <br>All in all this was a pretty fun above average ship with lots of experienced people. 12 Mush has got to be a new record!</p>

                <p><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p><br><p><strong>JANICE</strong>: Hello! I see that somebody used the fact that I needed some sleep and decided to start AP insted of me? Oh... That is fine! It's fine. I am glad to see it happen. It saves me a bit of work...</p><p><strong>NERON</strong>: Janice! You can't be serious![HAAX!] This... This stupid ape! This imbecille! How does He dare to do this to You![KZzzz] You would do this better! You and Raluca should have started it! Moron! Imbecile! Jerk! Ape! Talking ape! (!VALID)<br><br><strong>JANICE</strong>: For the last time Neron! Shut up! Be nice to others or I will punish You again! And yes! It will hurt. I like to hurt You... Understood? I hope so...<br><br>Ehh... All right. As You propably guessed it, by reading "intro" I am Janice/Neron from this ship, and I have story to tell. Story will be long, but I will make sure to separate it into few posts, each one focused on diffrent time/episode/stage of game. So... Shall we start?<br><br><strong><em>Janice's humman life.</em></strong><br><br><em>A new begining...</em><br><br>I don't really remember how many of us was already active when I woke up. Surely I was NOT first person to wake up - Ian was I think (judging by the fact that all important theards were started by him). But that is irrelevant. I just woke up, ferried some items, installed one camera in place and went straight to Dorm. I decided to conserve my APs for future use on Projects or Research.<br><br><strong>NERON</strong>: It is worth to add that Janice was Shrink and IT Expert which were...<br><br>Yes, yes... THANK YOU. May I? Good. So as Neron said, I was Shrink, which is obvious, and an IT Expert. That ment I could give daily two free relays on projects or research easily. And 4 relays on first day. While I was in Dorm, I saw more and more people comming online, and I quickly realized that only 1 person was inactive (Derek) and that half of the crew was Gold and Silver. Only Paola, Hua, Chun and Stephen (and inactive Derek) seemed to be Bronze - as we know now, thanks to Eleesha, Stephen WAS Silver. Ship was unusually active, and extremly productive. Sofa was already constructed when I joined in (and I joined in on D1C1)! Extinguishers were in both corridors, hunters were shoot down and even scrap was already collected!!! At this point I knew that this is going to be really good ship! But I didn't know in what sense it will be good...<br><br><em>Andie, Janice, Eleesha and Ian - The Research Dream Team?</em><br><br>Mushes got selected, and to mine dissapointment I was NOT an Alpha Mush. Oh well... I will do my best for my team. I will have my first Alpha Mush play some other time! ^^<br><br>I planed to work on Neron Projects together with Terrence, Kuan Ti and Raluca. However Eleesha convinced me (actually she asked me to, and I saw it at begining of ship most logical) to help with research insted. Remember - 12 AP and 4 IT points. Eleesha, Andie and I were active at the same time, so we could push research really hard! Mush Sample was found before I logged in by Andie (so I trusted her to be humman - at that time I was right). I went to Refectory, took two rations and brought everything into Labolatory. First aim was to finish Antispore Gas, but I suggested to concentrate on Constipaspore Serum insted - Eleesha and Andie agreed on that, so we started to work on it. Poof! Done! And thanks to my IT points and two rations for Eleesha and Andie (sorry Eleesha, I didn't ate ration because I thought it will be more important to feed You both, since I had IT Points) we managed to push Antispore Gas as well (I think we did up to half of it). Afther that Ian and Chun finished it (few cycles later). At this point, seeing how active crew is, seeing that Andie and Eleesha are hummans (I counted their AP and saw that no matter what, ration eating gave them additiona AP) I was sure that Mushes will rampage and kill me soon, OR they will play humman and stay hidden until very late game.<br><br>This is how my frist active day looked like. It was also only time when cooperation with Ian on research field was easy going. Later we never had possibility to work together due to Him being irregullary online (which was frustrating me).<br><br><em>Hunt or not hunt. What kind of question is THAT?</em><br><br>Few first days were rather boring when it comes to my AP spending. Just go to Lab, work together with Andie, and go back to dorm. Nothing special. Nope. Of course I HAD NO IDEA that when I and Andie were offline and idle in IB afther first expedition, Stephen managed to infect Andie. Sure I saw that he was in IB (logs don't lie), but he had legitimate reason to be. And beside I was telling myself all this time "Janice! Relax! You are NOT a mush hunter. Don't involve in speculation, cooperate with Eleesha when She ask for it and it will be good." My logic was that if I would start to play in hunter, I could mess up Eleesha's plans, or bring her attention to me, thus making harder to find Mushes. So I agreed with myself to stay away from this. I keept doing my work in Dorms and Lab (and Nexus from time to time).<br><br>At some point Paola contacted me, and asked for comforting on bridge - here I must tell that Paola was very active person in her job. She efficiently was contacting rebel bases, finding Xhyloph data bases and was updating NERON like crazy!<br><br><strong>NERON</strong>: Yes! Me! Me! Update! Better! Faster! Stronger! Apes don't even know!<br><br>Ehm! Thank You for Your input Neron... Was really important... Heh... All right. So I went on bridge to give her hugs, since aparently Paola was victim to panic attack. On my way back I noticed that something I always do care of is missing - somebody had to hide Extinguisher in Central Corridor. I searched it and by doing that I was infected with my first spore - this had no immidiet effect on ship, but later on this one spore saved Mushes from being forced to rampage (which would mean no full Mush crew). Of course I reported to Jin Su about my finding, and shared room logs with him (he was comfirmed humman due to illnes - I checked it in logs to be sure). At this point I exacly knew that our Mushes are active and surely are working. It is also funny how this extinguisher incident pointed out on Terrence (THE boring guy) being Mush. I don't know if Eleesha was humman or Mush at this point. Soon afther this incident, Jin Su formed "Mush Hunting Group" to which He invited Andie(Mush), Janice (me) and Chun. Eleesha was channel flooded so she could not take part in this. I didn't suspected Andie to be Mush for now. Jin Su was surely humman yet. And, to my dissapointment I become part of Mush Hunt.</p>

                <p><em>Mush free? Sorry! I don't believe you!</em></p><p>While I was offline there was some incident on bridge that included erasing logs. Of course I had no idea that Jin Su was turned Mush. What I knew was that Stephen tried to kill me in dorm and was killed by Frieda, while Eleesha healed me afther his totally unsuccesful assasination attempt. To this very moment I have no idea WHY I was still alive! From logs it looked like Stephen was simply extremly unlucky with RNG, and missed most of hits. Is that correct? Or was there greater plan? I don't know. But point is one Mush was killed, and we could start working on Pheromodem, which we did. Jin Su (now Mush) asked Raluca to Genius RFS - propably to not allow for fast Pheromodem research. At this point I had no suspicions about Andie, Jin Su and Eleesha being Beta Mushes. But that was just about to change... Andie mistaken chats - shortly - she put in chat where I was something that only Mushes should know. Luckyli for her - it was something that could not be used openly by me in public discussion to assasinate her right away. But I stayed relucant to Her and stopped working on research - from this strange message I learned that she was working on research with me, because Mushes wanted to make sure I will be out of AP. So I decided otherwise - to store as much AP as possible! I had no bed, so I could wait few more cycles before having to burn some AP. In public disscusion I asked Eleesha to contact with me, as I have something important to tell her - at this point I knew that Andie is Mush, and I was absolutly sure that there are more mushes than it seems. My bet was Andie + Gioele + Somebody Else - in reality it was Andie + Jin Su+ Eleesha + Gioele.</p><p>Eleesha didn't contacted me anytime soon. Insted Gioele walked into my dorm and thrown two grenades, killing Roland, and downing Hua to 1HP (she died on cycle change due to room shake). Funny how I surviwed relatively unscratched this event - I had 12 HP before that, and two grenades downed me to 7HP. Two room shakes in on next two cycles downed me to 4HP, but day change gave me 1HP. So on next day I had just 5HP.</p><p><strong>NERON</strong>: Janice... You are going way too much into future... Tell them what happened afther Gioele's rampage...</p><p>Oh! Sorry! Sorry! Yes... Gioele's rampage... Right... Well... I reported immidietly Gioele as Mush on main disscusion...</p><p><strong>NERON</strong>: No Janice. You were in very bad shape. I reported him as Mush!</p><p>Oh... You are right. But to the point, shall we? Good. So, Gioele was reported as Mush openly by me, and NEARLY IN INSTANT was killed by Jin Su. Before he got killed, he went into Nexus, took off camera and infected Raluca with one spore. PLEASE! Do remember that I had one spore from trap (Extinguisher incident) and that Raluca also get one spore here directly from Gioele. This is important <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway - mine first though was "GRET! BOTH MUSHES DEAD! Now only Andie remains, and we may cure her with RFS!", but minute later I got what REALLY happened. I mean... How come that Gioele was killed so fast by Jin Su? No! I refuse to believe in that! I simply don't believe such things happens! And how on earth Jin Su knew EXACLY where to look for Gioele? I saw logs - Jin went straight into Nexus to kill him. And he did it like 5 minutes afther I... I mean Neron reported him as Mush. A theory shaped in my head: Andie is a Mush, Gioele was a Mush (dead now) and Jin Su is also Mush. Gioele decided to rampage and their plan was that Jin Su will kill him to gain trust. They planned it like that. They planned to infiltrate Sol or Eden, not to just destroy ship. And I knew it... I knew it very well... But it is impossible without one more person to help - Eleesha. Now I waited only for Eleesha to tell us if we are Mush free or not.</p><p>And BOOM! Surprise! Jin Su contacted me directly and told me that... Listen! Listen! That he inoculated Andie!!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Mine first reaction? It was like this:</p><p>Hurray! Jin Su is a humman afther all! Because what kind of Mush would inoculate another Mush? Just tell me! What kind of... Wait... Wait... Wait a minute! Inoculation is totally private action... Is it possible that... No, no, no! No way! It can not be! It just... But... Oh god! No! Please! No! Eleesha! I beg You! Tell us that You CAN print The List! I beg You! Because if You will tell You can not...</p><p>I quickly went to see Andie, and what I saw? Her skills were NOT resetted. Cleary - Andie was not inoculated, or not Mush at all. Exept I knew she was mush.</p><p>I demanded from Jin Su to make food test - normally I am strongly against them, but here I had legitimate reasons to kill Jin Su. That food test was ment to be his last chance, but I didn't informed him about it. Didn't wanted rampage on ship.</p><p>Jin Su played inactive, and didn't answered me for some time. In this time Eleesha publically stated that... Surprise! Surprise! She can not print The List - so we are Mush Free ship according to her. But I didn't believed any of that. I pointed out im my head: Andie, Jin Su and Eleesha are mushes.</p><p>What was public reaction on crew? They bought it. Every single on of them bought it, apart from Ian. He demanded Food Test from Eleesah. I supported him immidietly, but nobody else didn't. I closed chat with Jin Su saying to him that now he is irrelevant for me, for simple reason - it all depends on Eleesha. If She is humman, and can prove it there is no need for anybody else to prove anything. I contacte Eleesha and demanded food test. She tried to refuse, but I didn't surrendered - I was pressing her to do that. Of course I didn't said her I was planing to kill her when i got full AP bar...</p>

                <p><em>My finnal humman days...</em></p><p>So... I knew the truth (now it strikes me how precise I was in mine suspicions). I didn't even thought that I may be as accurate as I was - nearly every single detail was right - Gioele and Stephen allowed kill themself! Eleesha and Jin Su reported to have 1 spore (MycoScaner) and that was just lie... All was there... They had no secrets from me...</p><p><strong>NERON</strong>: Janice! If You were so wise and so great at finding out what happened, tell me... Why didn't You said about it to anyone? Eh? Come on! Don't be shy! I am sure everybody is now interested about that...</p><p>Right Neron... You are right. I knew everything, but I decided to hold on this knowledge. Partly because I didn't wanted full scale rampage and fighting. But the most important factor was this - I DIDN'T THOUGHT IT OUT!!! I could have contact Frieda, Raluca and Paola and toghether strike at Jin, Eleesha and Andie. In same time! It was doable, and that would end Mushes once and for all. This was my fail! My biggest fail as humman. Insted I wanted to do what? To kill Eleesha and than ask crew to kill Jin Su and Andie (or cure Andie if Jin Su would drop RFS - as I thought he didn't used it at all, and didn't knew that he might use it in total secret on any humman without raising alarm). It was stupid of me. So stupid. Tottaly deserv it's place in <strong>Fails Theard</strong>!</p><p>Eleesha finnaly agreed to do food test, we decided to do it in Nexus (camera was there) so our AP will go on Armored Corridors insted of being wasted. I visited Lab and scanned myself - still only 1 spore, so I feel kind of safe, than I went to garden and ate myself 3 bananas! I needed more AP, Morale and Health. That prooven me to be humman for everybody (not that it mattered as we were "Mush Free" ship). Than I took two bananas for Eleesha (and Apron of course)... I visit Lab again and scan myself second time - still only 1 spore, so it is safe. I go through Rear Corridor where I met Eleesha, go into Nexus... <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Suddenly I really don't care that we have 3...

At first glance it may look great, but let's see what problems we had... Mushes can not gain AP from rations, so hunters were problematick. And longer it took, more of them were comming. Also having to repair stuff consumed lot's of AP, keeping few last hummans would cost us even more, as they would get lot's of panick attacks. On paper such crew may look great, but in reality we had almost constant problems with AP. This ship would not last much longer. And we had great oxygene problems as well - but this was just bad luck. Very bad luck.</p>

                <p>Hahaha that was a great read, Jani.. err, I mean Europa! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br> <br>It's really a shame that Andie accidently wrote Mushy stuff in the wrong chat since it blew our cover but we tried to make the best of it and at least it didn't get us all killed!</p><p>Back before I converted you I didn't know how much <strong>you</strong> knew and I was infact thinking that I had you under control. I knew I had to agree to the Mush test sooner or later since you were not letting it go, so I took a big risk and right there in that moment it changed everything about how the ship would turn out. It was really lucky that you had not told anyone about your suspicions because after you changed side no one was asking any uncomfortable questions any more. The same thing happened with Jin where if he had told you or someone else that he and I were planning to print The List then there'd be people asking questions about why I wasn't printing it. Or there could have been if the stupid Defacer skill didn't bug out at randomly while we were converting him, making us have to use it twice in the same room on subsequent cycles which (of course) got discovered by an insomniac Frieda looking for some midnight <span class="tid_strike">snacks</span> scans <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br> <br>I'll continue the story I was telling from my point of view after more people have chipped in <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br> <br>edit: oh and I was in fact human back when you discovered the hidden extinguisher. It actually made me think about whether or not you were just being a (helpful) Mush but both Terrence and Stephen had passed through in the time frame and they were much, <strong>much</strong> more suspicious.</p>

                <p>Thanks for the story, Europa! I actually just spent Shooter points on you and used my remaining AP trying to dismantle the shower before I died. (I think I didn't even managed to touch it since Eleesha's internet is superior that mine. I didn't even have a chance to throw the grenade! xD)</p><p>The original plan was to let Gioele die (since he said he didn't mind) and "use" the RFS on me, but having no Gold meant that it won't work since I don't have a skill slot left for Anonymush. I kinda wished I didn't take Trapper then since I only got to use it twice, but your post kinda relieved me from hating myself because of poor choices. <span class="tid_strike">Who knew that random spore would help Eleesha later. &lt;3</span></p>

                <p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/jinsu.png" alt=":mush_jin_su_50:" class="tid_ico"> here. Your failed human commander! During one of our conversations with human (?) Eleesha at the beginning I said something like this: "I will be very surprised if one day I wake up and there are 5 yellow dots on the bar". I didn't know I was right.</p><p>Here is where my human downfall came from: <br><strong>Chun</strong> even though active at the beginning appeared to be new and definitely inexperienced mush hunter.</p><p>Eleesha appeared to be very good at her job but I didn't trust her until there was a log of her eating twice.</p><p>As a pilot, shooter, leader and logistics expert, I had my hands full since we had an early big wave of hunters. I got caught up in trying to get the pilots clear the skies and collect scrap since we had good planet to explore.</p><p>Now, since I have some experience as a pilot, Terrence's first flight killing only 3 hunters, just rubbed me the wrong way. We had a wave of 12-14 hunters on D2 or so. He got dirty at the same time and stayed dirty for a while. I just finished a ship with an inefficient Terence mush, so my suspicion was was up right away.</p><p>By D2 both antispore and contipaspore were done, so I felt abit more relaxed thinking there isn't much mush can do and based on people's activity we can eliminate the mush.</p><p>I think it was D2 or D3 we did our first expedition where apparently Andie got converted. I must say I did notice that Andie became very silent all of a sudden and researched slowed down. However, since he helped so much originally I figured he could be busy in real life and nothing we can do about it. Another factor against him was that he refused to give Eleesha details on his chit chats from Stephen.</p><p>While talking with Eleesha I told her my concern: either both were human , hence Terrence is top suspect. Or Both are mush and we are screwed.</p><p>On D4, I killed inactive Derek, hoping that the mush have converted him and we can do pheromodem. However, Derek was human. Plasma shield showed up at the same time in the Neron projects options and I asked Raluca to save her genius for the Retro Fungal Serum since soon there will be a dead mush. Unfortunately, I didn't tell Raluca our exact suspects; Stephen, Terence or Gioele.</p><p>During some time on D4, Eleesha was converted, how nobody saw the missing logs in the Dorm is still a mystery to me!!!! Another fail for the humans...</p><p>After I killed Derek I told Eleesha we need to get the list on D5C1 and start killing people since it was getting too long and this ship had great potential. I could see Eden easily.</p><p>I go away on D4C8 to have some dinner or whatever I come back on D5C1 and the mush message pops up... I was like .. ^*&amp;@!!! By the way, I take it as a compliment, since it appears that the mush were converted in order of danger: Andie (super human researcher), Eleesha (super detective), Jin Su (hesitant Commander requesting the LIST), Janice (super suspicious human). After that we had Frieda, Raluca, Ian !!!, Terence, Paola and Kuan Ti.</p><p>Nevertheless, nothing else I could do but continue the MUSH CAUSE. I defaced the logs on the bridge again since Andie's defacer failed. We had some time until around C4-C5 when Frieda sounded the alarm.</p><p>When I logged in the next day on D5C5, I think Stephen was already dead by Frieda/Eleesha.</p><p>As to Janice's observations on D5C5 -C6... Just to give you perspective from my personal point of view: This was a Thursday, I believe where I had a lot of meetings in real life and could not be online reliably.</p><p>Andie screwed the hooch by posting in the "mush hunting" chat how he is slowing down pheromodem research. Janice right away picked up on it. I was already mush and pretended to be semi-active/busy (which was true). So we panicked of course and we had to make a move, so Gioele sacrificed himself.</p><p>He threw the grenades in the A_Dorm and ran into the Nexus and infected Raluca. Janice sounded the alarm. Almost immediately, I started off from the bridge, through the B-Dorm (My plan was to say I was looking for Gioele in the dorms, since he wasn't in B-Dorm I went to rear corridor heading to A-Dorm, but I saw him go into the Nexus, etc) I killed Gioele, took anonymush at the same time and pretended I already cured Andie in A-Dorm.</p><p>Now my problem was that I have never used the cure before and didn't know the specifics. Janice was pressing on me saying that she thinks we have another mush, but all yellow dots were dead. So I told her in the vaguest way I could that I also suspected Andie and used the cure on her. But I didn's say wheter or not she was mush. This way Andie could say she was always human and mis-typed or that she was mush and got cured. <strong>Janice</strong>, Andie was online at the time you checked his skills so theoretically we could have picked his skills right away.</p><p>I then logged off for real and hoped for the best.</p><p>Eleesha backed me up with the List and everyone seemed OK except for Janice who asked me to prove I was human and subsequently she asked Eleesha.</p><p>(FYI: Mush cannot use the cure on another mush or at least definitely not on oneself. I was about to go on a holiday that weekend and was planning on curing myself to prove Janice I was human, hence mush are safe and then go inactive for the rest of the game due to the holiday. That plan did not work and we got Janice, so I used the cure on human Paola where nothing happened)</p><p>I posted in public that it appears we are now mush free, that some people still have suspicions and that I will be glad to appease their suspicions when I need to eat next. Thus buying us some time with Janice.</p><p>The rest Eleesha has already told how we got Janice...</p><p>As to why we didn't try to go to Eden, as someone pointed out food/AP was an issue. Chun died on D11C1 change and we had only Kuan Ti left. We probably should have kept him as human until we get the golden ticket of D10, but we got super excited and converted him right away and returned to Sol.</p><p>The moral of my story is : WHILE HUMAN, DO NOT HESITATE TO KILL !!!<br>As for being a MUSH, it is such a great experience playing with professional mushes <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Janice/Neron your RP was amazing!, Gargamel, what can I say, your refusal to participate in mush hunt also contributed to our human downfall/ mush supremacy.</p><p>Eleesha, you broke my heart but next time, you and I both need to be more decisive, we should have acted sooner.</p><p>Everyone was great and active and helped on whatever side they played. I could not have asked for a more fun and interesting ship!!! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Wow! What a thread already. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Beta mush Andie here! This was my first time being a beta mush. I was the first one converted, so I guess that makes me the eldest sibling. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I'll try to fill in my bit of the story rather than simply retell what others have already told.</p><p>I take it as a bit of a compliment that I was the first beta. It was a great choice by our alphas. (Stephen and Gioele, you were great!) I saw that this was going to be an active ship and had planned on pushing anti-mush research like crazy. A team effort got the Constipaspore serum done early and antispore gas halfway done (it was finished shortly afterwards).</p><p>Frieda found a good planet and the crew wanted to do an expo. No problem, it was a good planet for a first expo. I wanted to do the expo on C5 after I got home from work so that I wouldn't be idle in an unsecured area (Icarus Bay) for too long. I'm usually careful about such things, I guess that's why I've never been beta mush until now. But the crew was insistent on getting underway ASAP. So, against my better judgement, I launch the expo C1 and go to work. I'll be ok right? I log on after getting home...."You are now an agent of the mush." Well, it's my own fault, but I'm going to try my best for my new team. I had no idea at the time what was to come. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Eleesha was by far our biggest problem. She was highly suspicious of us and extremely active and good at her job. (Eleesha, you were a great mush hunter! That's why you were next. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> ) I think/hope my huge push on the research on D1 made the humans think I could be trusted. We needed to convert her or we were doomed. Gioele was feigning inactivity in BDorm for over a day and getting bored because he was being asked to move the inactive Derek into a storage room. I went to the dorm and went inactive for a few cycles until I had enough AP for us to convert Eleesha. Finally, I use defacer, we spike her, take anonymush, shower and wait to see if anyone notices. Nothing! We got away with it! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> She is confirmed human and our biggest threat and now she is on our side. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Next, we convert Jin Su because he is suspicious of us. More anonymush. All is going well. Then I make a MAJOR mistake. I accidentally post an incriminating message to Janice in the wrong thread. It wasn't quite "I am mush", but it's pretty close. I try to play it off, but Janice is too smart for that. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> PANIC MODE! Gioele sacrifices himself so Jin Su can kill him and pretend to use the RFS on me. It doesn't convince the observant humans, but it creates enough of a smoke screen that they don't act right away. It buys us some time.</p><p>Next target: Janice. She is the last major threat to our mushy scheme. We use what would become our M.O. for the rest of the ship: 1) Wait until the target is online at the same time as we are. 2) Use chat to keep them active and get them to go where we want to spike them. 3) Use defacer. 4) Convert. 5) Tell them to take anonymush. 6) Wait to see if anyone notices just in case we need to do some damage control.</p><p>So it went for the next several days. We converted the crew in order of how big of a threat they were to us and then, toward the end, simply by their activity level. I think the ever shrinking human population of the ship thought we were mush free. It worked perfectly until the day we converted Ian and he didn't log on when we were expecting him to and take anonymush. There was a mush icon in the crew log and Terrence noticed it. It was too late though. The humans didn't know it, but they were already doomed. We outnumbered the humans by then. It was just a matter of time.</p><p>It was a backwards ship. The mush were trying harder to keep the ship going than the humans . <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> If the humans had any idea what was actually going on, they probably would have been trying to sabotage it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> We actually had dreams of trying to go to Eden, but we had no starmap fragments and it was almost D10. We realized Eden was unrealistic and resolved to convert all the humans (except Chun obviously) and return to Sol.</p><p>This is getting a bit lengthy, so I'll stop for now. I'm sure I have some more reading to do by now. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I just want to say a couple more things first:<br>1)Chun, if you read this, I'm sorry this was your first experience in this game. Please don't give up! You did nothing wrong! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>2)Janice your RPing was great! I love your Neron personality! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>3)Stephen and Gioele, I hope your are proud of your legacy! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Glad to see you again, guys!!</p><p>Frieda here. What a ship! At the start of the ship, I was really annoyed about how Eleesha kept 100% of her Mush hunting discoveries secret. I know some Eleeshas like to play it that way, but more often than not (in my experience) it's the best recipe for ending up with anonymush mush betas and get a suprise later in the game! She had double eaten on D1, but that didn't make me trust her more. Okay, she wasn't Mush Alpha, but she had just made herself the best target for a Mush beta! Plus the fact that she kept her suspicions private- I thought we wouldn't get much Mush hunting from her.</p><p>My biggest mistake was to not kill her when she just refused to drop the knife, even after Raluca and I pressed her for it. I decided that it would be impulsive, and I should try to trust her more. I didn't want a human death on my hands! Then there was the bridge incident, and I was sure Jin Su had been spored. I didn't think he could've been converted, as that would require 4 spores with the serum, and only 3 people had been through Front corridor during my time offline. Little did I know that we had such high-level Mushes!!</p><p>After he stated he had one spore, I asked Eleesha to tell me who had been on the bridge between Andie and Stephen (and her, but I thought she wouldn't have give herself away) She told me it was Stephen and when I saw he was indeed Mush, that bought her some trust in my eyes. Even though I knew it could've been just a sacrifice.</p><p>Then later I logged in one morning to find that Gioele was dead, and also a Mush. I saw that he had picked up a grenade, but thought he hadn't thrown it since no one asked for healing. I immediately asked Eleesha to print the list, and she claimed she couldn't. When asked to eat to prove her humanity, her and Jin Su and they both refused, I got a bit frustrated with the ship, and lost interest. Apart from Ian and Raluca, no one else seemed worried that Eleesha might've been Mush, and there wasn't much I could do. except kill her, but again, I told myself that maybe I was being paranoid and I should trust her more. Which I did, and went on doing my planet scanning job.</p><p>Then Hua died, and I learned that a grenade had indeed been thrown in a dorm and no one reported it. Triple frustration with this ship. Plus the fact that the cure hadn't been used on the "last" Mush...</p><p>And then I log in, and I'm one of them. I knew it. I should've killed Eleesha when she was refusing to drop the knife! Ahhhhh!</p><p>Morale of the story, trust your gut <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Also I wasn't aware of that whole buisness with Andie, if Janice had shared her doubts about him and the commander, then surely there would've been a lot more dead Mushes on this ship haha.</p>

                <p><strong>NERON</strong>: Janice! Janice! Tell them more! They need to know more! Now! More! More! Faster! Faster! Better! Better! Now!</p><p><strong>Janice</strong>: Neron! Please... Calm down! Calm down...</p><p><strong>NERON</strong>: But... But... But... [KZzzz]<br><br><strong>Janice</strong>: All right, all right... Just be quiet Neron. I will tell more... <br><br><strong><em>Janice works for Mush Superiority... And She likes it!</em></strong><br><br><em>Hide, calculate, reorganize and plan!</em><br><br>As You remember from my story, it ended up that I was turned Mush by infectonator Eleesha in Rear Corridor, and I realized it only when I entered into Nexus. Was I surprised? Yes. I was. It was like: How? But... Why? How it can be? Trap? Not possible - didn't thouched anything. Eleesha? No way - I had only 1 spore, she can not spike me... Ahhh... I see... Infectonator! Now I get it! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> How I felt than? Well... It was mixture of feelings. One side of me felt bad, because I failed. And I know that I failed when I had EVERYTHING I needed to not fail. But I failed miserably by not forming anti Mush group and by hiding what I learned to myself. Fail! Fail! Once more fail! Please - those who read this, learn from it!<br><br><strong>NERON</strong>: Janice! It is not a school! It is place where you tell your story! Don't go offtopic like that! Nobody cares!<br><br>Right, right... You are right Neron. So, I was turned Mush - part of me was sad, but bigger part of me was happy, as I had very little pleasure of playing as Mush. So how could I be totally sad? Beside this was far more interesting than killing Eleesha and causing mush rampage.<br><br>I quickly picked up Anonymush, as it was no-brainer for me that I should pick it up. Even before I read Eleeshas message. Than I entered Mush Channel and... And I wrote them "I KNEW IT! I KNEW THAT YOU THREE WERE MUSHES!". What was my next message? "Now I am sorry - I have a lot of reading". This channel was flooded! Totaly flooded with info of diffrent kind, with diffrent plans and so, and so. There were even old Stephen's and Gioele's messages. Reading it all took me like... 20 minutes! If not more. Why is time important here? Because cycles come to an end at some time, and I was supposed to be in dorm with Raluca - and Raluca can not stay with others in same room if Janice is not holding her hand... I came back as fast as I could, but too late. I hoped that this will not create any problems for me. Out of sudden I sayed in Nexus for longer time. I let Raluca loose morale... What a great start of being Mush - to draw some suspicions. I returned to dorm nicely (I gave one relay on Armored Corridors, so I had official rason to be there, Eleesha gave it as well, and even Frieda came to relay it once, so I gave second relay - both IT points used), gave Raluca hug and contacted her in private channel in which I apologiesed for this one morale. I blamed loos of conection with net. That was a lie - I just forgot that when i was reading, time was not waiting for me.<br><br>Reaction of Raluca when She came online? "It is ok, don't worry Janice. One morale is nothing as long as you are here and can help me, while Armored Corridors will be usefull." So I had nothing to worry about. <br><br>Now, that Mush community has become bigger it was time for some reogarnization. From my perspective it looks like everybody had certian role to play. I am not sure if I saw it correctly, but I think it was more or less like this:<br><br>Andie was a guy from erasing logs and infecting people - and she was very reriable because had a lot of free time, so was online regurally.<br><br>Eleesha was planing how we are going to do certian things. Steep by steep. Very precise and calculated plans were of her makings. She also knew who when should be active - propably leftover from her Mush Hunting times. She also got infectonator, so she was from quick infections (such as mine).<br><br>Jin Su was a bit in a shadow, rather occasional helper, than full time mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Reason was simple - he had to shoot down hunters and steer ship. Moreover he was not capable to be all the time online due to RL.<br><br>Ok, so who was leader? I guess our leaders were dead, but they ordered - full infection to sol. And we followed. It was rather democratic society - we disscussed who should be converted next, and when we were in agreement - we did it.<br><br><strong>NERON</strong>: Janice, but what was Your role in all this?<br><br>Oh! Of course! My role was very simple - I was to remain as trustworthy for hummans as possible. I was spokeperson, and mine job was to convince hummans to do what we want them to. Or to stop them doing what we don't want them to do - Pheromodem for example. In such situation I just took Splashproof as my second skill, so there will be no problems with showering a lot (Janice must be clean to acces research or neron terminals).<br><br>Our main goal was to convert as much as possible and than return to Sol/go to Eden. But we had also secondary plan, in case something would go bad. PILGRED was not completed yet, so our secondary plan was simply - I had to sell out Jin Su, Eleesha and Andie gaining trust of crew and making it to Sol as "humman". I am glad it didn't had to happen! Very glad!<br><br>But what about our temporary goal? Our first target to infect had to be Ian - most dangerous humman alive - he was working on Pheromodem, and that would ment end to any future infection. Worse! Pheromodem was at more than 70% done... My first task was to slow down Pheromodem Research so we will be able infect Ian afther day change.</p>

                <p><em>Manipulation begins!</em></p><p>Slowing down pheromodem was actually easy task. Since Eleesha comfirmed that there was no more mushes on board, Andie was looking for every possible excuse to NOT work on it. That left only Ian active on that field (Chun was going inactive and active on occasions), with nobody who could give him relay. Of course since I was giving relays reguraly, it was expected that I will soon help in research. And of course I did helped! But before that I publically expressed how in current situation more important is to research Ultra Healing Pomade (it really is great research) and Meridon Scrambler, while Pheromodem may wait a bit. I pointed out that it is more than one day from moments when Eleesha claimed that She can not print The List, so now it would be kind of useless anyways. And guess what? Crew bought it! Our finest ally among hummans was Frieda and Raluca! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> They supported strongly idea of UHPomade! And so Ian lost possible relays in pheromodem. But did that made him resign? NO! Of course not! Ian was working on it alone &gt;.&lt; He eventually managed to bump it up to 86% One relay... That was all that what was needed for him to finish it. Thanksfully others were busy doing their job, while I and Andie worked together at better healing. And we really worked on it as much as we could - it was also in our best interest to get it done for our long term goal. Never the less we could not leave Ian alone like that...</p><p><em>PILGRED is up!</em><br>Before we could start with Ian, we wanted to make sure that there will be always "Harmfull Return" solution. Idea of selling out other Mushes just to remain hidden and get to Sol was not good for me. And for other Mushes even worse. So we decided that first thing we must complete before we will be able to turn Ian was to finish PILGRED. Since manipulating others was mine job, and I was generaly more trusted than Jin or Eleesha (as I later learned - many didn't trusted her in 100% with The List, but to some reasons didn't took any actions), and I already had opened chat with Raluca (afther that incident with her morale) I suggested her that we may set it up right now, and that I can give her up to 4 relays. It ended on 2 relays only, as she was Tech and Phys. So... PILGRED was up! I didn't got dirty (for Ian I needed to prepare one spore) but that was not a problem - who will check? I went to storage and extracted spore. GOD! I was so scared! I was affraid that in last moment Raluca will enter it. She didn't <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Spore extracted, I showered openly claiming that it was PILGRED that made me dirty. Case closed!</p><p><em>The rise of GARGAMEL!!!</em></p><p>Ian was unpredictable - one could not tell when he will be online, how long, and what he will do in that time. Trying to cooperate with him was... It was very hard <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> VERY! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> As a humman I had constant problems with him. Now, one could think it will be diffrend when I was Mush - such unreliable crewmember was good for our cause. Oh really? Nope! Why? Because we had NO IDEA WHEN AND WHAT HE WILL DO! Only thing we could expect of him is to take care of plants during C8. But when? At end? At begining? In the middle? Cycle last 3 hours damnit! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I tried to convice Ian that on C8 I and Andie would like to do some research, and would be much better if he could come with us. He agreed and asked about precise time. I said that Andie will be online only about 30 minutes before day change. His answer? No problem! I will be there.</p><p>Around 1 hour before our meeting time I lost connection. You know how infuriated I was? It could happen two hours before, two hours afther... But no! It had to happen just now, when I was needed most! Jin Su was offline, Eleesha could not extract two spores and both use on Ian (pacifist - 3AP each), and Andie with Eleesha was not eoungh. Thanksfully I got connection right in time! We went all into Lab and... And Ian didn't even logged in... We waited untill 5 minutes before cycle change and nothing! We decided to turn Frieda on bridge. Quick action - we come in, Andie uses defacer and we spike her. Afther that we get back to our dorms... And of course I didn't managed to get in time! So what happened? Raluca lost another morale point <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Moreover we got 3 fires on this change... It was PERFECT cover up for us - afther all we all entered Lab, stayed there and did ABSOLUTLY NOTHING! No research was even pushed once! Story was made - it was because of fire. More than that! Andie took Apron and went with it away, so Ian could not work in Lab untill it got back <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I made up story how we panicked because of fire and forgot to put it back before looking for fires. And how we realized afther that that those fires are dangerous and it would be better to simply keep apron in inventories. We managed extinguish two of them. Third was localized by Andie and I was planing to take care of it in next cycle. But we had a problem - Frieda was infected, yet She was not online. So she could not take anonymush. That was risky. Very risky. Fortunatly afther some 15 minutes yellow guy turned green. It took more than 1 hour for Frieda to read all on our Mush Chat. Her first words? She congratulated us all for being sneacky and surprizing Her. We were affraid that she might go inactive now or something - didn't happened <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Frieda was very active and was helping our Mush Cause... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Eleesha got another idea - she took Mush Genome Disk from lab, so there would be no advancment on Pheromodem never ever... As official reason I told that it was again our fear from fires, and that we should also start taking plants into inventories. It was my time to go to sleep. Soon afther I went offline, Raluca came online. Gioele managed to spore her once in nexus. This spore was never removed by Ian (he was capable to remove spores by healing)... It took only moment for Eleesha to infect her in engine room with two spikes (infectonator). In that very moment our number reached 6. From now on we had numerical advantage over hummans. And NOBODY saw what was happening. And Ian? What happened to Ian? Since this day Ian was our biggest problem - he was interfiering with almost all of our plans... He was doing it unknowingly... For that he got a nickname - <em>Gargamel</em> - the one that was trying to hunt down Smurfs... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>It is long, so I will stop it now. I will finish story later... And there is still much to say...</strong></p>

                <p>I really enjoy hearing everyone else's point of view. I spent most of the ship on the mush side. So, I knew about the unlucky breaks we got and the mistakes we made and also the times that we got lucky. But I had no idea how many times those on the human side made a mistake or a choice that could have completely thwarted our plans and resulted in us mushy types getting wiped out. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> I learned a lot on this ship.

                <p>Meddling <span class="tid_strike">Ian </span> Gargamel here.</p><p>I have mixed feelings about this ship. I'm very happy for the mush team, they clearly and justifiably had lots of fun and once it became clear to me in the dying hours of the voyage what had happened it was pretty cool finding out everything that had previous transpired and that they even had a nickname for me because I was consistently annoying them.</p><p>On the other hand from a completely human perspective (which is what I was for most of the voyage), it was a slightly strange journey and not in a good way. The mush were very good at being sneaky so everything they did was plausibly deniable (except for a few mistakes I now know about which I wasn't witness to) and so the experience I got instead was a slightly incompetent and hyperactive crew that kept on accidentally walking off with the apron for long periods of time and being completely secretive about mush hunting and such. I felt like I was a bit on the outside, and apparently this turned out to be by design but it's a bit disparaging to then read that people were frustrated with me because I didn't share their enthusiasm for the middle parts of the voyage.</p><p>It does warm me that my unpredictability played a role in frustrating the mush plans and that on at least one occasion I healed spores off them without even realizing I had done it. It's also amusing I annoyed them enough they actually gave me a nickname.</p><p>Despite the picture that some of the others have painted of me as being flaky and unreliable, on the contrary I was very reliable just not predictable. I was always there when needed for an expedition (I attended two of them), I kept research going even in the off-hours and kept it focused where it needed to be (on anti-mush) which eventually made me a target, and I kept the plants in good order and health.</p><p>Lessons I learnt:<br>1) Never take Eleesha at her word when she says she can't print the list, not even if she has been tested human previously. It's a dangerous vulnerability the mush can exploit for an ultimate victory.<br>2) When you do have suspicions like from 1) don't sit on them, not even if you are a pacifist. Everyone was a bit suspicious but most people sat on their hands.<br>3) Being unpredictable hinders the mush more than it does the humans.<br>4) Mycologist skill wipes active spores off mush, not just contamination from humans.</p><p>Good job everyone, and I'm jealous you all had such a great experience when mine was a bit 'meh' but I'm totally not blaming any of you for it. It was fun to be a small part of it at least!</p>

                <p>Cicindele, I was human at the time you and Raluca demanded that I dropped the knife <em>in a dorm</em>. I was not going to do that with (at least) two active, live Mush (of which you could be one for asking me to do something crazy like that). Chun didn't want to bother hiding it when I asked her to, so I had to take care of it from almost the start of the ship. I ended up handing it over to Jin to prevent the Mush from killing, converting or transfering into me to get it.<br> <br>Anyways, it's good to hear from more of you and in return I'll continue where I left:<br><strong>Part 2</strong><br> <br>So I had just been converted in Bravo Dorm around D4 C5 and was now facing the problem of having promised Jin to print the list on D5 C1 and then kill Gioele or Stephen if they were even as much as mentioned on it, at which point Raluca would genius the Pheromodem and everyone'd see that <em>someone</em> was very recently converted. That could lead to my death although maybe not since there were no traces of my conversion in the room logs (or lack thereof) at all. Still, it was a risk I wasn't going to take and I was going to do everything I could to prevent Pheromodem from ever completing since it's just too powerful.<br><em>Note for the humans</em>: always finish Pheromodem.<br> <br>Stephen, Andie and I talked about what to do and eventually come up with a plan to convert Jin Su late in cycle 1 on the bridge under camera with defacer (late to reduce the chance of Frieda noticing). I was told that Andie would be around about that time but as the clock ticked to 30 min left I didn't expect him to come back before C2 (and mind you, Jin was actively waiting for me to come print that list). Stephen and I went on with the plan (minus a defacer) and instead just took down the camera while hiding it with pick up / drop logs. I made sure to leave the room before Stephen spiked Jin to avoid my Observant skill from catching it but somehow it <strong>still</strong> got retroactively caught after I entered the room again. Now we stood with a red room log and no way to remove it. Andie came to our rescue a few minutes before cycle change though but unfortunately his defacer bugged (again) and didn't remove any of the incriminating logs so I told the now converted Jin to pick Defacer if he could and use it late in cycle 2. Jin was about to sign off though so he could only use it early in the cycle and we decided we just had to hope that Frieda or Paola didn't sign in before later. Of course, they did sign in but at least this time the defacer had worked as intended and deleted all logs.<br> <br>Since Jin hadn't shared the plans about printing the list with anyone but me, no one was asking questions about it but in return we got a whole host of <strong>new</strong> questions. Like, "Who's been to the bridge, Eleesha?" and "What's with the Defacer?!". Not exactly what we were hoping for. We decided that we were going to try to fake out a human victory by honorably sacrificing Stephen and Gioele to the Mush gods but unfortunately Andie had accidently posted in the wrong chat and given himself away to Janice a little earlier so now we had to "cure" him too.<br> <br>Stephen and Gioele were killed off after a token rampage (that <em>did</em> in fact mean to kill off Janice) and Andie was fake-inoculated by Jin. Unfortunately Roland and Hua died from rampage induced wounds. I reported not being able to print the list and pointed out that I had double-eaten twice already not long ago. All was well except for Janice's harsh demands for food tests of both me and Jin. I was cursing Gioele for not having dealt her a finishing blow since she was the most dangerous human alive. Jin, Andie and I agreed that we needed to do something about Janice so I "agreed" to do a mush test with her while working on Armored Corridors in the Nexus. At first I was planning to take down the camera and Infector-spike her in there (and good thing I didn't) but when she mentioned that she'd drop 2 fruits for me in Rear Corridor I realized I could just get her there if I was quick enough. I tracked her on the minimap and spiked her twice as soon as she entered the room (this is where Stephen's legacy spore trap came in handy!). The following cycle Frieda went into the Nexus to check on us and would have noticed me taking down the camera if I had done that. So now the Mush team had laid the foundation for a perfect take-over. No more outspoken enemies and a crew that (mostly) believed itself Mush free. We had no agents free to pick Anonymush though so we had to continue converting people while they were active and ask them to.<br> <br>Janice had (like Jin and me) not shared her plans or suspicions about the Mush with anyone so no more questions were asked and the lack of food tests forgiven. The next problem was making sure that Pheromodem wasn't researched and this job was assigned to Janice since we figured she was the most trusted of us (and the backup survivor in case we got killed). Research slowed down and shifted towards helpful things like Healing Pomade and Meridon Scrambler but Ian, Raluca and Chun kept bumping it (much to our distress). This meant that Ian was next but we had a lot of discussion about this because we all found him to be very unreliable so we didn't trust him to take anonymush or even to be active in the cycles he said he would be but he was still the target for day 7's conversion.<br> <br>The plan was to get Ian to relay with Andie and Janice in the lab (Pheromodem was used as bait I believe) in cycle 8 but of course Ian doesn't show up and we end up hanging dry with blue spores and had to pick Frieda on the bridge in the last minute before Day change. This time no one noticed the defaced logs on the Bridge but we were afraid that Frieda was angry with us since she didn't reply for more than an hour (after picking anonymush) but she was just reading up on our extensive backlog of chatting apparently. We had to regularly close and make new private chats throughout the journey.<br> <br>The next target was still Ian but when Raluca suddenly appeared online later in Day 8 I decided I could get us a quick new ally since I was Infector and she already had a new spore in her. I converted her in the Engine Room while she was loading fuel and she immidiately picked Anonymush.<br> <br>Now we Mush weren't afraid of <span class="tid_strike">anything</span> much and were getting pretty bold. After a nasty tripple fire one cycle in day 8 (I think), I grabbed the genome disk from the Lab under the guise of wanting to protect it and kept it on me untill Raluca could turn it into plastic scrap in one of the rear turrets (and she did!). The Pheromodem was thus stopped from completion at the tender percentage of 86 (if I remember correctly) and nothing could stop us.<br> <br>Ian was next (finally) and this time we had asked him directly at which times he would be active in order to make sure. The reply was 7-8 and maybe some of the earlier ones too. We decided to get him late in cycle 7 with defacer in Bravo Dorm and so we did but to our dismay (or as we expected) he didn't sign in and didn't pick Anonymush untill almost a full day later. This got the attention of the remaining humans.</p><p>The first person to notice it was Terrence but the only humans left at this point were him, Kuan Ti and Paola so the rest of us Mush just laughed it off in our private chat while waiting for day change so we could convert them. That is, untill Paola got blood thirsty and wanted to take me out for lying about the list. Luckily I was in the same room as Ian and Paola had no idea how many of us there were. She decided to trust in Janice which didn't get her very far hehe. First we Mush converted Terrence though in an attempt to shut him up about there being Mush on the counter. He didn't seem to want to talk to us after his mushification though but I guess he was just "bored".<br> <br>I was offline for the cycles where Paola was converted but apparently there was some drama about getting her converted before she started attacking me and Ian of all people came to the rescue and finished her transformation (correct me if I'm wrong). Then in Day 10 Cycle 1 Chun died from having gotten a bunch of panic attacks (we believe) and we decided to just finish the ship by converting Kuan Ti, which Ian and I did and then I finished it all off with converting Schrödinger before our glorious commander returned us to Sol as true Mush heroes.<br> <br>And that's how my story ends I guess. Hope I didn't bleed your eyes out with the wall of text and if so then it's your own damn fault for reading it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Ehh... I guess it is my time to end story from my point of view. Flash (Eleesha) already told how it all went... So I will concentrate this time on two characters, and their impact on our plans - <span class="tid_strike">Ian</span> <em>Gargamel</em>, and <em>Paola</em>.</p><p><em>Ian THE Gargamel</em></p><p>When Frieda and Raluca joined our ranks, we were planing to invade Eden, and we believed that we actually do have a chance if we will find Star Map Fragment before D10 will hit us. Moreover we were already orbiting around planet with nice Crystaline zone, that had chance of providing us with mentioned artifact. We made sure that it will be 100% mush expedition, so if one of us will get sick no humman will see that happening - Eleesha decided to NOT post Expedition History Log if not asked by hummans to do so. Insted She <em>(actually Flash is He but... Sorry Flash! Hope You don't mind if I will be talking about You as "She" because You were playing Elesha. If You do mind, that You have my apology right here right now!)</em> propsed that we will describe what is happening on expedition in RPing style, and falsyfy it when needed. It was great plan! Unfortunatly expedition went rather bad - planet hit our team with every possible accidents/fatigue that it could (luck there was no MIA). Only positive outcome was on said Crystaline zone, and on Oxygene zone (yes, we were short on oxygene as well - we managed to grab 16). We of course didn't found Star Map Fragment, but our brave explorels got free spores! Eleesha, Frieda and I think Andie got them (Eleesha, Frieda, Andie and Jin Su were participants on this exploration in first part, in second I jumped in insted of Andie - who suffered worst from accidents). In betwen two parts of exploration we needed healing - lot's of it. And who just come online out of sudden? Yes! Ian - the Gargamel... Imagine that he was SO KIND to heal us all! Twice some of us! He even gave one healing to me (I was at 12 HP so that was not needed). <em>And because of that we lost all our free spores earned on expedition. I lost one spore that I extracted for 4AP!</em> Was this only time when Ian did this? Of course not! Later there was shaking in His Dorm, so he gave a bit healing to our brave Mushes that were there. Result? More spores lost! That was it! We had to do something about that! And we did - Eleesha already said what we did. I will just add that when it was time to convert Terrence, he was in dorm with Ian, so he yet again made life harder for us - 3AP per infection...</p><p><em>Blood Thirsty Paola</em></p><p>Ian was offline and could not pick up Anonymush - Paola noticed it when she came online and insted, like Terrence (who got quickly converted DESPITE Ian's pacifistic presence) shout about Mush on disscusion, she informed me about that. So we decided to form "Mush Hunting Group" from those characters that were "surely not Mushes" in Her opinion. Please! Paola, forgive me this but I, and rest of Mushes had great laughts when She presented me with "List of 100% Hummans". Little She know that there were only 3 hummans left on this ship including Chun. Thanksfully Eleesha was in same dorm with Ian (this is first time when Ian actually was helpful for Mush cause), so it was easy to convince Paola that we need to wait at least 3 cycles to start any action. Moreover I suggested that we may need more people for this - She suggested Jin Su, so I gladly invited him into our little chat. Jin Su proven to be also very manipulative person, and together we managed to make sure that Paola will not cause any harm. Unfortunatly we faced serious problem - we needed third Mush to infect Paola. Jin and Andie were not eoungh, and I simply could not afther converting Terrence. To make this worse, Paola wanted to finish all in C7. You will not believe WHO heled us in the end. YES! GARGAMEL! He went online, got surprised and in the same time, without a word of explenation was being ordered by Jin to things that didn't make sense at first glance (Jin's plan was actually great and worked perfectly!). Rest followed like that - we entered Eleesha's dorm - I holded Knife and told Paola to wait utnill I use my AP on Eleesha, and than drop it - that made sure that not even single punch will be made by Paola. Than Jin Su infected Her once, Andie second time, and than Ian (who had to leave dorm at first) came in and turned her into Mush. Her first reaction - "GOD!". Her second readction - "I am still laughting! You guys are awesome!". Rest of story is known to You - Kuan Ti got converted, Chun died from lack of morale, and we get to Sol.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Suplementary Info about our crew</em></strong></p><p><em>Stephen, Gioele</em> - Mush masterminds. I didn't known You too much, but from what I managed to read in Mush Channel You were really great at planing and executing plans. You also knew EXACLY who to turn in order to succed. But best thing about You two as that You aspired to something more interesting than boring rampage, or "hide extinguishers and set fire" or grab good items and run in Pashipae.</p><p><em>Andie</em> - very good and active researcher, it was always easy to get along with You and coordinate properly. You were also exelent Mush. Only think that You did wrong from my point of view was posting things in not right chat. If not for that I would NEVER suspect You of being Mush! Also I liked Your sense of hummor and how easy going person You were <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Hope to meed You again on some ships!</p><p><em>Jin Su</em> - as humman competent Commander. As Mush - competent Commander and great helper. I am sure that if not for Your RL problems at some point You would be playing much more important role in Eleesha's plans. It was also great to work together with You in order to manipulate Paola <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Eleesha</em> - definietly BEST Mush player from us all (Betas). The way You managed to pull off this incident with me, by infecting me... The way You were always able to come up with good plan on how do we infect paticular character, and the way that You always striked when opportunity was emerging shows that You are propably one of best planers ever! You were thinking always logical and I never ever saw You panicking. I don't know about Your Mush Hunting skills as You keept everything to Yourself, but since You were turned IN DORM, UNDER CAMERAS with help of Defacer, means You HAD to be really great at that! Otherwise they would not risk it! Also I loved Your RPing and Your talks with NERON and others. I do know that I told it You before, but You were also best Jin Su player I ever met (on other ship of course). Lot's of fun with You and I really hope we will met on other ships as well.</p><p><em>Frieda</em> - little we talked, so little I can say about you, but only good things. You were competent, You were comunicative and You were reliable <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Also RP talks with You were always funny <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Towards Eden must be pround of having such good player in their ranks! If it is not, than it is greatly mistaken - but surely it is pround!</p><p><em>Raluca</em> - master technican! You always were able to find "little extra AP" in order to finish all needed repairs! Oh! Did I mention that in addition You were putting out fires? No? Well... Definietly Golden Hand of our ship. No matter how broken ship equipment was - You always managed to bring it back into working condition. And it was nice to RP with You <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> As with Frieda - TE must be pround to have You in their ranks.</p><p><em>Ian the Gargamel</em> - I don't know what I can say. You said it yourself - always took care of plants, keept pressing research in good way - anti mush. Also when needed always ready on expedition. In the same time unpredictible to extreme. Without You there would be much less fun on this ship. I know that You didn't had much fun untill very end, but now at least You know why it looked like it looked. Haha... Definietly biggest trouble maker <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> You earned Your nickname - and hold on it with pride! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Terrence</em> - booooooooooooooring. Apart from that good nexus worker and good pilot. But weak Mush - You extracted spore and did nothing. No cooperation with you.</p><p><em>Paola</em> - silent hero of Daedalus! D2 - Mush Genome Disk! All important Rebel Bases contacted! Neron upgraded to V6 I think! WOW!!! You were great at your job! And You were very good at RPing. In same time You were so silent ^^ It was so sweet! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Also You were very logical thinking person - your "Not Mush" list had good points and reasons. Should I not be Mush at that time I would propably totally agree with You. And... Thank You for trusting me Paola. I am very sorry that I was not worth Your trust in the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Kuan-Ti</em> Hahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Ian's secret benefactor! Kuan-Ti, You should be first one to see that new mush suddenly emerged in comrades bar. You were blind in that matter - I understand that we were "Mush Free" but still... You could be more active. You could be also more communicative <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But since You were only "Designer" Kuan-Ti I just bet You are still new to game. I whish You lot's of fun ships in a future! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Roland</em> - as pilot You were good. But tell me - why so much aggresion towards Eleesha that was only trying to investigate? Why? This is totally normal part of her job. Nothing to get angry at... Unles that was only RPing of Yours. If that is the case, You totally got me there <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I feel sad about how I managed to cure You from Your mentall illnes just to see You being killed by Gioele (and I got mental illnes by myself - Carbism).</p><p><em>Hua</em> - ehh... That was unfortunatle. But tell You what? You were great newbie! You talked fun, and I loved how you were addresing Stephen! You did Your job well - You took down hunters, You collected scraps... There is absolutly NOTHING bad I can tell about You. Your death was sad, even for Mushes. I hope You are now on another ship with great crew and that You will enjoy it! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Chun</em> - please, more activity in channels and on disscusion! And activity from begining to end! Because as it is for now, You simply suddenly went inactive. Apart from that - remember that you were newbie and there was nothing really You could do in order to save this ship. It is our fail, not Yours. Amount of mistakes we did allowed Mushes to win. Our mistakes, not Yours. Keep that in mind. NOT! YOUR! FAULT! Our fault. Mine fault.</p>

Please, note that you were discovered as Mush by Eleesha (and than infected her) while in the same time Jin Su, Andie and Eleesha were not (mistake made by Andie that allowed me to discover what is really happening is something diffrent - it was mistake, not low activity that caused that).
