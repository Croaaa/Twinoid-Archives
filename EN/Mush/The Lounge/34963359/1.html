Roland, Hua and especially Janice were moeveing (a bit) but never saied a Word. And Frida did not evan move at all.<br>Giole was killed early, thanks to him, crosseing the Engine of a verry unpolite Raluca.<br>And after testing, investegateing and suspecting randomly almost the whole (remaneing) Crew, we finally managed to kill Hua Mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"> (sorry Hua^_-)<br>We could have make it Much longer, if only we had at last some Expes, but with the most inaktiv Frida ever...<br>We really had some brilliant player here, but we also had some of the opposite.</p><p>Btw: I was Eleesha ^^<br>(and sorry for my english)</p>

                <p>Hello, Terrence here! I wondered if we will have an afterparty thread <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This was my first time as Terrence, so after realizing I'm useless at upgrading drones (as bronze player I didn't have Pilot, and there were no hunters anyway), I decided to concentrate on Mush hunting and helping Raluca with PILGRED... Most of the voyage I was afraid she might be a mush, but from my experience most mushes try to keep low profile, and Raluca definately didn't ... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> What I liked on her was that she actually was roleplaying (and in a very unique way), what I didn't enjoy was the constant swearing... Especially when she dropped a C-bomb on Eleesha, that was awful!</p><p>And Jin Su was really bad, I wonder why he was that pessimistic so early <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I feel bit sorry for framing him, but Chao was indeed a much better commander <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Also, I feel sorry for Giole, he was a new player and we killed him - or murdered him - way too quick.</p><p>All in all, an interesting ship, many nice and active players, some griefers, and a very sneaky mushroom (well played Hua on sneaking for so long... in case you see this, who was your target for sporing? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">). The suspense made it a memorable game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>By the way, one tip Kikkoman - when you play Eleesha again, don't destroy the list <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> It makes you suspicious <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Otherwise, you were best Eleesha I ever met! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hi! Chao is here!=)</p><p>Hey, Kikkoman, you were really good Eleesha. I agree with Ergo. The most active and doing her direct job properly Eleesha, that I have ever seen! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Also I sure, that I've met you previously in D2N in some random towns.</p><p>I was really disappointed about Jin's behaviour. With a bit more glad and patient Jim we could go further. For example, I've played for Jin 3 times and 2 ships from them came back to SoL with victory. That's a reason, why I were managing more less good with role of Chao "Commander". I confess that was really difficult when all the journey you get ill or dirty and in the same time you have to calculate your AP for comforting, killing, washing, moving the ship when with every cycle change you get only 1AP. Anyway gameplay for Stephen much more hard. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>What else? You forgot about Paola. She didn't had an opportunity to work as Comm officer all the time, BUT her critical mind saved us from most crucial mistakes. In every conversation she took opposite side giving us to understand, that we have to think more about subject.</p><p>I had more successful ships before, but this one was really full of suspense, as said Ergotoxin.))) Jin's hunting, Raluca with her funny language and worse manners, good hiding Hua, my mix of Shrink skill and desease Psychotic episodes, Ian that was suspicious because of his negligence in taking care of his plants, frightening Janice, Stephen with his patriotical phrases in russian, jumping with hacker kit through the whole ship, early Pilgred's completion, etc...)))</p><p>Anyway that was great ship with his own taste. Thank you. Hope we'll meet again sometime!<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/wang_chao.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_WC:" class="tid_ico"></p>
