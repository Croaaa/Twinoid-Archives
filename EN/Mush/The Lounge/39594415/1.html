                <p>Before you continue reading this thread, please note the ship is not completely over at the time of the creation, and as such, I will post the end results once the ship finishes, but for the most part it is already over as all the Mush will be exterminated by NERON next cycle.</p><p>As a Mush Terrence, I saw all of the dark plans we've schemed to destroy the humans. It is a shame this ship could of gone a lot further if the humans just didn't start Natamy Testing. We may of even reached Eden with most of the crew as mush! Before I explain the story of this ship, here is some information:</p><p><strong>Alpha Mush:</strong><br>Terrence<br>Janice</p><p><strong>Beta Mush (In-order of Conversion)</strong><br>Kuan Ti<br>Frieda<br>Eleesha</p><p><strong>Inactives</strong><br>Paola</p><p><strong>List</strong><br>Terrence, Jin Su, Gioele, Roland</p><p><strong>Skills</strong><br>Terrence: Splashproof, Anonymush, Hard Boiled, Nightmarish <em>(Took for kicks and giggles as the humans were all dead)</em><br>Kuan Ti: Splashproof, Anonymush, Fertile, Mycelium Spirit<br>Janice: Trapper, Green Jelly<br>Frieda: Demoralize<br>Eleesha: ? <em>(Didn't get a chance to check)</em></p><p>This ship began on a steady growing crew and we had few problems. Both research and project completion was rather stable and we knocked out quite a few given the circumstances. With Paola inactive, Eleesha had to take over as Communications Manager reducing her effectiveness at Mush Hunting gives us, the Mush, all the leeway we needed.</p><p>While working on projects, fixing Pilgred, and collecting scrap, I managed to finish Kuan Ti in the Nexus. He had fumbled into a trap laid by Janice and I was able to finish him off with a two spikes on Cycle 8 and Cycle 1 of the next day. Additionally, being the sneaky mush I am, I took anonymush hiding the fact the mush counter grew from the crew. At this point, the Mush transitioned to a Private Channel rather than the Mush Channel because we were worried one of us would get discovered and killed allowing them to break into our plans. We also wanted it so we could retain the details of our plans for Mush who joined us.</p><p>At this point, we had no more easy targets and Mycoalarms were on their way. Research was steady, but so was our plans. Given that we retained them, here is exactly how we got Frieda:<br><cite><br>1. At the start of the cycle the camera should break if we calculated the time right.<br>2. Janice will spike Frieda first and then give Kuan Ti the go ahead.<br>3. Kuan Ti will then spike Frieda making her a mush and take anonymush as fast as possible.<br>4. Then wait a bit to become active.<br>5. I'll come in after Frieda becomes mush and complain in chat with something like: "Ah.... What?" under the broken issue alert and head to Alpha Dorm.<br>6. I'll spike someone (probably Jin Su) and fix the camera.<br>7. I'll report that the camera got fixed and since I haven't been in Alpha Dorm in forever no one can point the finger at me for sabotaging it.<br>8. I'll return to Bravo Dorm, and go back to sleep.<br>9. After a little bit, you two can go off doing whatever needs be; though, it would be best that one of you pretends to be inactive so they can't locate a pattern easily.<br>Misc Step: At some point we'll invite Frieda to the chat once she is mush.<br></cite><br>After converting Frieda, most of the important crew members were Mush as Raluca didn't have technician and was killed shortly later during Natamy Testing due to Injuries; thus, leaving me, Terrence, as the only one who could finish Pilgred. At this point Pilgred was at 60% so it would of been a problem for the crew to kill me and repair it themselves. Luckily, before they Natamy Tested me, we hatched another plan and completely ruined the humans' day:<br><cite><br>1. Janice and Kuan Ti will travel to Bravo Dorm, and Janice will get death announcements turned off on the way.<br>2. I'll remove the camera.<br>3. Everyone spikes Eleesha soon as the camera is removed.<br>4. We migrate back to Alpha Dorm, and kill Derek if we can. Janice remember to save action points for Ceasefire. (I'll be attacking last for the next step's reason).<br>5. After we kill Derek, I'll grab the Natamy Rifle and try disassembling it.<br>6. After we're all done and ready to rest, Janice will use Ceasefire to give us 3 peaceful turns to recharge action points.<br>7. Janice will post a fake death message for Derek to keep the crew from noticing. Use something like Steel Plated or another random accident.<br></cite><br>At least that was the plan. It did slightly differ after some more scheming as we would just not post a death message. Additionally, we ended up killing Jin Su and hurting Roland pretty badly. As for the actual plan, I failed to dismantle the Natamy Rifle, but I did shoot Jin Su with it so that is a plus causing him to die. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>From here on out, we discussed whether or not we wanted to turn everyone and keep Chun hostage to try for Eden or just kill everyone. We ended up going with murdering everyone in the end simply because we didn't have the man power to deal with the hunters after retaliation from the humans. Eleesha also ended up dead, so we had no one for communications anymore. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In the end, it was a mush victory just waiting to happen. Even if the humans did kill us, they would have no way to reach Sol. I would like to thank my partners in crime for assisting in this massacre where we ended up with twelve defunct crew members of which only one was Mush. It is a shame we couldn't make it back to Sol.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> Glory to the Mush <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>It was really well played on your part.</p><p>I was Andie. My role makes me see nothing, since I've almost never get outside the lab and the medlab.<br>The investigation was quite crappy (Derek seemed inexperienced, because the so call "natamy testing" was not... and he was a little bit too much trigger happy on this). It conforts me though that I didn't share much the location of the mycoalarms. But it didn't get useful at all, so...</p><p>You played well and I think one of the problem on the human side is that people sticked too much to their role, so, for example, they didn't help much Eleesha on the mush hunting.</p><p>And I must say, you worked so well undercover that, at some point, we were questionning ourselves if the mush wasn't playing strictly human.</p><p>I was a little bit disappointed in the end because it seems to be that we could have done better.<br>But this game is harsh and you learn by making mistakes and mistakes again!</p><p>Thanks for this game anyway. I regret I wasn't on your side (but at least, I managed to kill Eleesha with Stephen. I could have done a little more damage if I had connected a few minutes earlier in the end, since Janice killed me 10 minutes before I woke up ^^" ).</p><p>I don't know if you already jumped, but I haven't and will do soon, so maybe we will see each other again soon. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I've jumped directly after the ship died ans the crew is just waking up. I could be wrong, but I think Janice is Roland on the new ship, but I could be wrong. It was a shame we couldn't convert you, but we didn't have much of a chance. Going to the lab was too mush-like and would of given us away.</p><p>As for the Mycoalarams, we assumed they were placed in the Lab, Medlab, Nexus, Rear Corridor, Front Corridor, Refectory, and/or the Engine Room. As a result, we prohibited ourselves from spiking in those locations. To be honest, I'm not sure how the mush hunting went since Eleesha didn't say much, but given that you resorted to Natamy Testing, it couldn't have been going well.</p>

                <p>Massive Mush Move (or something like that), it is a jump a lot of active players do. Pretty much a time is specified each month and everyone tries to jump at the same time to get mostly active ships (13-16 active members). Their pretty hard for the mush as everyone who jumps tends to be pretty good at the game.</p>

                <p>Jin Su here, I really felt bad on this ship because I really was trying to mend the missing actions of inactive players, doing research with Andie or hunting pilots outside. Never really sticking to one activity completely. So in the end everyone though I was most likely to be mush when the list came out and Derek was in fact too trigger happy.</p><p>Then again I always take it as a sign of good play on my behalf if the mush feel the need to assassinate me. Happens in 2/3 ships. Never get to die differently than assassinated. I guess because I never let myself get caught easily like Kuan Ti unfortunately did and I always try to be on the lookout for mushy behavior.</p><p>But in my experience, the mush only really have a highway to destruction whenever there is an inactive Eleesha or otherwise occupied, like ours...</p><p>All in all, hats down mush and I just want to add that I hate inactives and xp farmers. I strongly believe that people becoming highly inactive should be banned from playing the game for a week or so, and that over 48h inactivity should be reportable.</p><p>Anyway, have fun on your next journey.</p>
