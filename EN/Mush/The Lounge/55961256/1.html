My partner, second alpha, was <strong>Jin Su</strong>. And he was killed by Neron <strong>before </strong>game start. So we had 5 cameras, active pilot team, active research team, dead mush. But there is a good part in this. I am alone so I can do whatever I want and can have some fun. No need to worry, no need to coordinate, just be yourself. Ok.</p><p>My first plan was to be sneaky and to try to make humans kill each other. I was sure they will not kill me first, I am the only source of morale as shrink. So I watched, helped, reported. But this plan failed. <strong>Gio</strong> wasted OD and QS in nexus and finished Convenient Sink instead. And nobody punished him for this stupid move. So I realized humans will wait, will not kill.</p><p>My second plan was to convert <strong>Chao </strong>and ask him to kill <strong>Raluca</strong>, the only tech on board. I thought <strong>Chao </strong>is experienced player because he had no skill. (2 lvl or higher). But <strong>Chao </strong>became inactive so this plan was not good too. (btw he was silver, he had itrakie and it looks he was lvl3 or higher)</p><p>I could just kill or convert(on day change) <strong>Raluca</strong> but I was not sure if they would not get gold for tech skill. And I had this kind of victory before, I hoped to do more interesting trick.</p><p>I even had a plan to start fire and run away on patrol ship with extinguishers (both were in RC and easy to get). But it's lame and boring. And gold <strong>Roland </strong>could spoil this plan.</p><p>Decided to act at D5. It was the time I should be starving so I didn't want to get into this trap. And <strong>Chao</strong>, who had spore from start, soon would be able to be sold. Or he could die.</p><p>I began to move at the same cycle commander <strong>Gio </strong>moved ship to a planet with oxygen. <em>10 min before cycle change</em>. I changed BIOS settings (lock projects to have opportunity to use patroler in any body). I walked to storage and stole 2 oxygen. I broke oxy tank after it, went to BD, transfered to <strong>Chao</strong>, loaded 1 fuel to chamber, walked to second storage stole another 2 oxygen and broke tank. We had now 1 in chamber. Nobody noticed. <em>1 min before cycle change</em> I walked to the bridge. Cycle change. <strong>Stephen</strong> is dead. Asphyxia. I have title now, commander. I pushed the button and sent ship out of this planet. Walked to bay. And this is where my plan was not good enough. I didn't know I can't use patrol ship at the time of jump. It has logic but I hoped I will be able. Never mind. I had backup plan.</p><p>Walked to lab where I noticed armor a couple days before. It was still there. Walked to medlab to heal myself (<strong>Chao </strong>suffered steel plate and roomshake, he had 5 health at all). Went to lab. Now I had armor on me, Ian as shield and <em>crasy eyes</em> skills. 5ap per kick.</p><p><strong>Roland </strong>was lucky and managed to reduce my health enough so I was forced to walk to medlab and heal myself again. I used all bandages there. And I had no mp to move out. This was the place they killed me.</p><p>Not good for me <strong>Raluca </strong>survived and helped to finish PILGRED, but it was a chance I gave her with my plan.</p><p>4 dead humans, no <strong>Chun</strong>, no RFS - not so bad I think. Humans could have less dead mates but <strong>Chun</strong> hid HK and died (So <strong>Hua </strong>didn't get to Sol) and she left armor (so humans spent more ap on killing me). Also ducts could save life but <strong>Gio</strong> finished sink instead.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And I was lucky humans did not kill my previous body - it had 2 oxygen units in hands. May be <strong>Terry </strong>would survive this way.</p><p>Interesting game, active crew, next time I will be more lucky I hope. Thanx, guys.</p>
