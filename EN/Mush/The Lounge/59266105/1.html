                <p>Alright, Jin Su again, reporting affirmatively. I had a lot of fun with the RP on this ship, especially bouncing off of Chao. I'm also not sure why, but this ship felt slow somehow, like there was never a lot of momentum throughout it.</p><p>Chao was the first to note that Hua was not starving as she should be and took care of her, and the confirmed chat also strongly suspected Stephen because we had no proof that he had eaten for nine days, but ended up RFSing Raluca for the sake of Pilgred. I have to ask, when did Kuan get infected? Because great work Stephen on that conversion that pretty much no one saw coming.</p>

When I got online, I saw that I got the funglic infection disease which also made me dirty.</p><p>I assumed it must have been from a starting spore as I double checked the room logs and didn't see any chance for the mush to get me discretely since there was a camera there. So after spore sucker finished, I went and took the starting spore off me and checked that I had no spores when the myco scan was completed. At some later point Eleesha made a mush hunting chat and I was invited to it along with most of the rest of the crew.</p><p>If I remember correct a fire broke out during day 8 so I took the extinguisher and went to look for it, I remember I didn't have much :pa: so I went to refectory to grab coffee. Since my inventory was full, the coffee I pulled went onto the shelf and I was unable to distinguish between the coffee I pulled and the one that Stephen dumped 4 spores into. I wasn't so careful at that point since alpha mush Hua died early. I reasoned that since I had no spores on me (I extracted the starting spore early on) even if the coffee was spiked, I shouldn't be converted as I didn't expect 4 spores to be there. I ended up drinking the coffee that had the 4 spores in it and instantly became apart of the mush and took anonymush (I am unsure if anyone saw/noticed the extra yellow person on the crew bar) before going to fix the broken oxygen tank that Gioele found.</p><p>Since I was apart of the mush hunting channel, I fed Stephen information from that channel so he knew that he was heavily suspected and likely to become the retro fungal serum target so he decided to take off in the Pasiphae. The hunting crew was deciding using the serum on either Stephen (the most suspicious one to the hunting team) or on Raluca (not really suspected, but she had important skills for a quick get away in PILGRED). I should mention that at this point in time there was only about 14 oxygen and 5 fuel left. So the crew decides to serum Raluca just to make sure and then Jin Su abandons Stephen into space. After that it was a PILGRED rush and a quick return to Sol.</p>
