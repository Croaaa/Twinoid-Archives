We were on this <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7091">ship</a>.</p><p>It was a casting ship with special conditions (apron is lava, alternating between research and projects, Eden must be reached for either side to win).</p><p><span class="tid_strike">Actually I did write already a big text about every character, but accidentally closed the tab when looking in another tab, so I lost everything. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> well, I will probably try to write it again... </span>(done)</p><p>It was nice that I was able to play as Andie for the first time, especially since Andie is now away for the season. <span class="tid_user tid_user_4944058 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="4944058">Farfalla</span>, when you read it...you were right, Andie is awesome ^^.</p><p>Let me leave a comment regarding every character now:<br>_______________________________________________________________</p><p><strong>Captain, Commander, Magnificence Jin Su:</strong> People might think they have a good commander, some people might think they have a great commander, but..all of them are overshadowed by our Jin Su! ^^<br>He didn't only do a good job, he also tried to impress us as often as possible ^^.<br>One time he offered to move ship 4 minutes before cycle change, he and myself still in dorm...I accepted the challenge, loaded fuel, but..mush is slow and so I finished and informed only 20 seconds before cycle change. A second later ship was moved. It wa sunfortunately spoiled since Frieda did have bad eyes or a bug occured, so we arrived at the wrong planet xD.<br>Another time, after an expedition, he was at 4 hp, only 4 minutes till cycle change, but he rushed to bridge, moved us out of orbit, returned to IB waituing to get healed.. healer with meditkit wasn't active, so he gulped down a full jar of alien oil <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>King, formerly Baron Stephen von Seagull</strong>:<br>You proved that awesome player don't need awesome skills. Also you established the aristocraty while being one of them, Baron von Seagull. Everyone else in exception of Paola and Jin were only peasants. Your help in mush hunt channel was great and you were my connection to Eleesha's informations. well played!</p><p><strong>Unlucky Eleesha</strong>:<br>You used all your aps in getting logs of..everywhere.. On the one side you got very much and a great amount of information, which also helped in mush hunt (for example who ate at which time), but on the other side it made you also suspicious, because I saw alsmost no participation of you anywhere. The coffee incident was only unfortunate <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> So most of your information were not trustworthy the whole time...<br>But in the end we didn't have to cure you, so you being unlucky to get an illness while Raluca was killed was actually very lucky for us ^^.</p><p><strong>More unlucky Hua</strong>: Hua, you were lovely, I especially liked your occasionally minor mistakes like posting in wrong location, it made you more likable to me ^^.<br>Very unfortunate you got killed at last expedition where we also found the last starmap piece...</p><p><strong>Great Kuan Ti</strong>: We were in private chat during muhs hunt and it helped me to make you much less suspicious. You are a very helpful and nice player, I wonder who you are!<br>It was cute how you were frightened to get killed ("Oh, Chun entered bridge, I am afraid now every moment she will shoot me with natamy rifle <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">" )</p><p><strong>Addicted Chun:</strong> Great job, you managed to stay calm and staying patient. Thanks to that we managed to kill only mushes and injected the right person in the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>I also liked your RP when eating the pills after mush were gone..when you got abilities like X-men <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Ian, power of love</strong>: Skillful and dependable. We had some serious discussions during mush hunt, especially when I wanted Paola to confide in me, thx for showing me that my phrasing was misleading.<br>Still we got attracted towards each other during the voyage. Especially during our research lessons, we will see what will happen on Eden ^^.</p><p><strong>Heart-broken Janice:</strong> Janice seemed very nice to me, unfortunately she fell in love with the wrong person, Chun, and got probably rejected. Though first showing interest in many people and trying to do alternative therapies with them she became more and more silent, probably because getting ill in RL, but RPing it as broken heart. You were a Janice how I am imagining her! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Joker Gioele</strong>: Thx for being a powerful Gioele, also you were taking all the coffee by yourself, that was amazing. Very reliable player and I know we wouldn't have get to Eden without you! Maybe just try out a bit more RPing the next time.</p><p><strong>Hulk Hogan</strong>: I think Frieda named you one time like that, I like it ^^. Nice playing, I noticed you were very much avoiding the Bravo dorm, the only time you got dirty you did confide in me afterwards I think.. so to me either no mush or..very very sneaky mush. Sry for kicking you out of bed after I noticed that you probably ate a jumpkin the previous cycle. ^^. But it helped us, not long later Raluca was killed and Paola cured. I know you didn't want anyone to see it, well.. if I wouldn't have seeen the log, noone would have done it. Btw, I noticed a while later that my jumpkin head did heal within one cycle, so it coudl have been that we even had not seen any head even when you were human.</p><p><strong>Dirty Terrence:</strong> Terence got dirty, often. Like always, right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> well. you were a high suspect (especially because of Raluca's deception), good that you participated in the end at that expedition with high chance to get ill, your participation and that you confided in me one time made you much less suspicious. I wonder what would have happened otherwise.<br>And I wonder who you will marry at Eden. Daisy or the woman out of flesh, you didn't want to tell me...though I guess it is the one you wanted to drink tea with?</p><p><strong>Suspicious Frieda:</strong><br>You also was one of the player being suspicious to me, one reason was that while I was at bridge offering Paola to confide and yourself too, both of you didn't confide.<br>Then moving to the wrong planet, because you probably didn't read the right direction or because of a bug didn't help you well too..<br>In beginning I thought you helped very much with antimush research, which si making you more trustworthy. later i thought you getting dirty from all that antimush research coudl just have been an excuse to get dirty more often <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Chun also found you suspicious, but since we were patient you got that random illness at one point and your suspicion faded away...</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"><strong>The mush team:</strong><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"><br>Here I have to say generally that mush team had really bad luck... Not only that the victory condition for them is very difficult, it seems that in exception of Paola the mushes were very inactively playing at least the first 2 days and had low mush level.</p><br><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"><strong>Roland: </strong>Sorry, but you seemed like an obvious mush right from the beginning. You were inactive for a long time, stayed a while in unprotected room, went to Bdorm even when not having any bed there, didn't speak a word in first day, took bed as soon as it was free though being fully silent...Normally I woudl have killed you already..It lasted 3 days more until Stephen pointed strong finger on you again and Chun decided to kill you.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Raluca</strong>: <br>You also were inactive during the first 2 days, though I think you also produced some spores there. relaying pilgred 2 times and one nexus participation was everything we got from you during first 2 days..but it was weekend and you excused with RL, which can even be true though you being mush ^^.</p><p>Later you did well being sneaky, pretending to got spored one time, did not only make yourself more likely a human, it did also Terrence more suspicious since he accidentally visitted you while you were in engine room.<br>For most time we believed it...until evidences showed more and more that Terrence seems more likely a human.<br>You also did confide in me reguarily, making me sure you didn't create a spores.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_drug.gif" alt=":hordes_drogue:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Paola, formerly the Princess:</strong><br>Thx, you did also a great job being sneaky.<br>Only time you made something suspicious was during decoding of the important rebel base of day 3..where you pretended to not able to finish it after 8 or 9 tries.. I was playing Paola already and knew that it normally took me only 5 tries, so it was very suspicious to me...especially since you weren't even able to decode it after eating and got dirty instead...<br>For some cycles I was in bridge waiting that you might confide in me, but I also didn't really want to force you, so I left after sleeping in RL and you pretended many cycles later to be inactive because of busy life.</p><p>You did well lowering your suspicion afterwards: one time, when Chun offered you to eat something after you pretended to be out of ap, you spent at least 4 ap afterwards, maybe you used phagocyte, but it made you more trustworthy.<br>Second time, when you loaded at one time fuel after your comms job was done and while you just told to wait 10 minutes in Bdorm whether someone could heal you, I used the opportunity, healed you and offered you to confide in me, if you wished.You did and I was surprised since you didn't sue opportunity to extract a spore.</p><p>But when time passed more and more humans got confirmed, either by Finola's list, getting illness or Derek with the jumpkin. Before Raluca was killed only Terrence wasn't confirmed human. So all mushes were found out in the end.</p><p>Thank you for the nice mush hunt, which was very difficult, and exciting. We were mush-free somewhere at day 9 and I think staying 9 days sneaky is a nice achievement for mushes!<br>And considering your skill levels, activity and roles you probably couldn't have done much better...</p><p>All in all it was a paranoia ship though humans won in the end and had much bigger advantage., but the mushes made the voyage at least very exciting.</p>

                <p>Great ship. Eleesha, I thought your diagram was pretty cool. But whenever I look at any sort of mush logs like that my brain begins spinning until I stop, so I had no idea what in the world it meant. Also, really nice mush play Raluca, to claim to have a spore and that Terrence visited you. I almost murdered Terrence many a time from that right up to your death.</p>

                <p>Hi, Raluca here. Yeah, we were a bit unlucky. I had to be away for a day because of IRL, and apparently so did Roland. Paola being the third mush, we didn't have a lot of good reasons to walk around the ship to spore people, and you were always staying under cameras, so no matter what we would try, we'd be found out immediately. Chun kept checking all the shelves, so trapping was also not an option. We were planning on having one of us murder or rush convert Eleesha so she couldn't print the list, but we wanted to wait until the RNG kicked in a bit more to leave you less AP to deal with us. The other mush would then lie low and try to get to Eden. But then, you got us.<br>I was really hoping I could pin some blame on Terrence when he accidentally walked into the engine room, but unfortunately, it wasn't enough <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">.<br>Also, in my opinion, apron is lava and alternating projects and research didn't do too much to help us. Research and projects were still getting done at a good rate, and our average mush level wasn't very high. I'm starting to think this kind of ship will really only work with high level mush.</p>

                <p>Baron von Seagull here. Well, after I got promoted by the Lady in the Lake and I recieved Excalibur, you can call me...</p><p>King Stephen I von Seagull, King of the Space Britons*!</p><p>It was a really nice experience. Too many bloody peasants in the ship, and there was always the red menace there, the permanent risk of a communist take over, or a mush take over, or a... communist mush take over. Those commoners will never take our rights and nobility titles!</p><p>I enjoyed the ship a lot. Not having a proper job (solid/chef Stephen) forced me to RP even more and it was really enjoyable. Being so paranoid is indeed interesting and I was always thinking that the mush was playing really sneaky but effective. I was really suspicious on Eleesha for that coffee but thanks again for sharing your logs with me. I was afraid you were even faking it but it worked well in the end. I was also checking for traps and so on all the time but nobody tries to infect a Baron and lives after that. And also thanks to Andie for all the mush hunting that we tried to do together. It was fun.</p><p>Don't worry Frieda. Your proletarian revolution will never be triumphant. I will fund the first Kingdom ruled by the von Seagull, in Eden, and we will conquer the world! Feudalism and freedom! You can join my serf crew. I always need more of them.</p><p>Thanks Commander Jin Su. It was a pleasure to work with you dealing with those peasants and commoners. You did an excelent job and you deserve my respect. Maybe I could order you Knight of the Holy Chun, Mankind's last hope.</p><p>Long live the House von Seagull!</p><p>*Maybe one or more of the titles here are indeed forged. [citation needed]</p>

OTL The skies were always clear already (plus all scrap taken care of) except for that one time I actually got to go out myself. And whenever I looked, it was always between projects and research (aka a project was just finished and no research had been decided on). I realized later I could have spent some AP on pilgred, but I didn't think about that at the time.</p><p>And I never liked Roland... particularly after having finally played him... though I was looking forward to some TE mush play... we didn't really have a plan, and with RL being so distracting for me lately, I never even got around to picking any mush skills. &gt;3&gt;</p>

                <p>Yeah. On the coop ship as Hua I had trouble finding use for my AP. One of those jobs that has a hard stop with AP used. There's a lot of research/projects to do, and when that's done you have repairs. There's always the chance for better planets. But pilots have a limit.</p>

                <p>When you had such a low amount of time and didn't check in often. why did you take a bed then (also at first day you really stayed fully silent)? I think you went to AB2 in beginning, scrap was already collected, you opened one single capsule, stayed there a while, then came some cycles later to Bdorm, standing there..until at one point someone left the bed and you took it 10 minutes later...though you should have been at full ap or almost full ap. And then you were lieing in this bed for many cycles... <br>There were times were also at least one hunter was bothering us for 4 cycles until Jin took care of it. And you came online shortly after that was done, complaining again that nothing was to do for you... You understand now, how mushy it seemed?</p>

                <p>I know, it was just slightly frustrating (more after the fact than during) that it wasn't even a technique.</p><p>Well, I said I didn't really have an idea about how to play Roland. That was about as much as I could come up with RP wise, particularly with how I was feeling about things (in game and RL). So that particular was more my attempt at RP than mush tactic... Which didn't work well since nobody really reacted to it on top of not having the time to read everything that was happening.</p><p>I hope to have <span class="tid_strike">more </span>success in future games.

                <p>I apologize for my inconstant play: RL had been tough and weird for me, so I was just joining to make sure we had the body count to launch two ships. For once the RNG god(ess?) had mercy; I was human Hua, and I got corpolalia from poor <span class="tid_user tid_user_450451 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="450451">Mysteria</span>'s death, so I was trusted fairly easily. I didn't participate much in the mush hunt, which I tried not to feel terribly guilty about.</p><p>I also tried a more abrasive persona for Hua, but I think (especially in the beginning) I overdid it a bit. Sorry about that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>Thanks for an interesting ship, everyone.</p>
