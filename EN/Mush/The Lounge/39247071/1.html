                <p>Endship link is <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4324">Here</a></p><p>Naturally, of course, as we all know.</p><p>This ship began... oh... 17 days ago or so. When I woke the next morning, four cycles after game start, both Mush were dead and we had no Icarus. Proceeded to ask about, on the forums, in various IRC chats to see if it was possible to gain the Icarus back... Rumors had it about Mag net and Mag Ret, so we rushed through projects, completing all projects we could in... somewhere around 4-5 days, rather fast compared to how I've usually seen it done. Research slogged a bit because we focused on projects, and most research just had to do with Mush anyway.</p><p>We finally got Mag net, mag ret, moved, and no dice. No Icarus. Tentatively, myself and the crew agreed to set forth on the journey to try and survive, and push forward, without an Icarus. We had a polyvalent pilot, after all. What's to stop us from trying, hm?</p><p>I, of course, was the enigmatic, always watching, stupidly active <strong>Captain Jin Su</strong> who returned us home from Sol. And, of course, the one who pushed us to keep going the most.</p><p>I wouldn't have returned us if I saw a single way for us to keep going, but so late, I knew it just wasn't going to happen. For survival, so what we had worked on for the past seventeen days didn't come to an abrupt waste, I had to make the call. I didn't want to have to deal with a possible three crew deaths on cycle change on my hands. That blood would've been on my hands, and I knew it.</p><p>Despite that, you were all fantastic. Andie, you were a hell of a carry, a hell of a diplomat, and one awesome explorer. Raluca, amazing mechanic. Frieda and Gioele, always doing their jobs without question, without complaint, and working towards finding us the planets that we couldn't get to find an Eden we never found. Rest in peace, Gioele.</p><p>Janice, for her tireless efforts in keeping morale up and her love life with Ian, which was an amusement to see. Thanks for putting up with this captain, eh?</p><p>Kuan-Ti, and Paola, and Hua, and many of the others. You all inspired me and kept the ship going long past a point where most crews would've given up and let it die. You believed in me, and I believed in you. In this, I have no regrets.</p><p>And now, I push you on towards newer ships, with the hope that you accomplish what we failed to do here today. Go on. Find Eden elsewhere, somehow. It's a wonderful place, with amazing beaches. I have faith in you.</p><p>Captain Jin Su, out.</p>
