                <p>This is your captain speaking.</p><p>What a rough ride this was. We lost four of our most important crew to the brain rot from Cryo: Frieda, Andie, Hua and Roland all idlers.</p><p>We were suffering pretty badly for pilots, though luckily there weren't many hunters. Gioele and his precious java filled in okay for an astrophyicist, and between Terrence and I we managed to keep our hull intact. Ian and Paola did their quiet jobs to great success, and Raluca snagged us PILGRED and RFS pretty quick.</p><p>The Mush game wasn't great; Eleesha was found out and killed by our Chun, and Derek's mutated form crumpled under the weight of knives and blasters. Too late for us to save Stephen, however...</p><p>Morale was a real problem. I regretted not taking Leader, as we killed Janice, then Stephen died.

                <p>Raluca here.</p><p>Awesome AP thread name, rather sums up half the ship.... excluding the active human half, the winning half!</p><p>Ship was slow to fill, and many of the early joiners went to odd places.... which left both dorms free. I actually got to sleep in a dorm by myself for like 3 cycles after joining, as like the 7th player aboard or so, because I just asked everyone to fill up bravo dorm first. Was so nice to be a Raluca with a bed.</p><p>I got to have a dorm to myself again near the end of the ship, because despite 11 of us alive, there really were only 7 other active living players by that point and some of those were not really trying to get an open bed, so... alpha dorm to myself again. Was even able to yank down the camera and enjoy some quality time with Jin, important considering our morale issues and the way RP had gone.</p><p>Chun had caught mush Eleesha very fast by wandering around and looking at roomlogs; Eleesha had pretty clearly been a very new player who wandered all over and spored in a room with an inactive. We had a small juggle of AP to kill her (only Chun, Eleesha, and myself active right then, none of us high AP, but a bit of confusion and knife passing got the deed done.</p><p>Minutes later, I saw something I'd never spotted before: Janice, who always gets a unique death message, was announced as dying to assassination, just like Eleesha had, but with the 'generic' death message that most players get. A refresh showed only one person dead. A frantic check of who I could invite to PMs included Janice among the talking, thus living....</p><p>Janice had used a /neron message to spoof her own death? Really? Whhhhhy? And so confusing. I explained it and how she did it. And wondered and wondered.... was that a form of attempted suicide, or supposed to be funny, or worse? What was that? Why was it? I still wonder. Janice never talked about it, and a couple of cycles later a started Gioele (one of our precious few active folks) was asking why Neron was locking him out of projects. Not only had Janice spoofed her death, she'd set BIOS settings to something less than savory for humans with mush about, Piloting was unlocked and now projects were locked, right as we got O2 ducts against two fast to finish worthless projects. And Janice still wasn't talking to us.</p><p>I sent her a PM, asking her to switch the lock back and explain why she'd changed it, to talk about what she was doing with the spoof of her death, and asking her for a few hugs (having warned Chun and others that if I suddenly died of depression, look to Janice who knew I was a demoralize target). She replied to answer that she'd switched the lock back to piloting, happy? .... and didn't answer anything else or provide any hugs. Sadly, the project choice we had then included O2 ducts; it got four votes and nothing else had any votes.... but designer Kuan, able to access through the Project lock apparently advanced detect anomaly quite a bit.... because when Janice unlocked projects she then finished Anomaly detector.</p><p>We needed that O2, rather badly. Jin was our only initial pilot, and Terrence went tech immediately, then decided between pilot or robotics expert; Hua was a pilot but utterly inactive, Andie was a pilot but utterly inactive. Roland was a sprinter, Frieda wasn't a pilot but was utterly inactive. Jin and Terrence struggled to keep our sky clear, and our hull went below 40 with us having had only one chance for scrap collection.... Jin says we didn't have 'many hunters'.... sure we didn't, just enough to keep us totally pinned down hunter-wise for most of the game! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We had no diplomats, so expos for air were going to be a problem. Shipfill started after D1C1, so no D1 bananas or super early plants...</p><p>We got lucky though. A merchant offered 10 O2 and 2 fuel as the basic deal for a hydropot. Whew. Whew. Often the basic deal's for around 7 O2, and we needed every bit we could gasp.</p><p>The other alpha, Derek, decided to rampage instead of lay low. Stephen had apprenticed Shrink from Janice, who we killed from suspicion of we don't understand what she is doing but it's not pro-human. Morale was an issue, but the morale rebel bases were on their way, so killing the surviving shrink wasn't so effective. A better plan would have killed me, then Terrence (no techs, down to 1 pilot, and all the other problems still exist), but if Derek (or Eleesha) had tried to sneak and survive, I feel sure mush would have won.</p><p>At the end, we had 4 living inactives, about 6 O2 left, and about 34 hull. Sure, we still had fingernails left to hold on with, but barely. If we had a living mush, we couldn't have finished Pilgred, wouldn't have had the extra coffees, and would have had to spend AP to kill more people, or risk the high danger expos to get more O2 for more time, while somehow not dying to hull damage while we tried to catch the mush we couldn't find....</p><p>It's not wrong to rampage. But a better plan tries to make <em>sure</em> your side wins because of what you do and don't do.</p><p>Poor Paola had a fit, when Sol connection went down and only a few could try to reconnect. I was saving up AP for Pilgred then, and we had hunter issues and O2 issues, and her most memorable line, for me at least: <strong>It doesn't take 11 people to save up AP to finish Pilgred!</strong> Poor Paola. It can be hard to understand what's going on in the rest of the ship when you rarely leave the bridge, not sure if she understood the inactive ratio or any of the other problems but Comms.</p><p>One thing I really want to talk about: The idea of <em><strong>not</strong></em> finishing Pilgred before ship fill, at all, ever.</p><p>We could have, that ship. I noticed that, as the cycles passed before ship fill, counting the apparent inactives not moving from the many turrets and other strange places, and I thought to myself, "Hey, I could get someone to reset me, we could complete Pilgred. We could end this ship before it begins".</p><p>What a waste that would have been. Sure, this ship would have needed big miracles to get to Eden. But you know what? This ship was fun. This ship was a challenge. This ship was hard and good and glorious and had great RP and I met players I never played with before and enjoyed getting to play with - this ship was a ship!</p><p>Sure it was a short ship, we returned to Sol with Cure on D6. But don't end ships before they start, even if it looks like it's a grim start. Really. Give them their chance. It's a ship and you signed on to it. Play it out - no matter how grim that start looks.... you might be <em>really</em> pleasantly surprised.</p>

                <p>I may have been the captain, but you kept the ship running, Raluca. Thanks for all your help; of all my (admittedly few) ships, this was definitely one of my favorite.</p><p>I still have no idea what went down with Janice. I'm starting to think it was a bug, honestly; she didn't seem coherent enough to fake her own death message.</p><p>As for, uhm... the importance of our quality time together, I'd like to direct you to my glory blurb. Killing Mush, giving orders, and flirting with Raluca were deemed to be my three most important things done aboard the ship. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/bg.gif" alt=":cool:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Terrence, my pilot buddy/supply chain drone! You weren't particularly glamorous, but you were a solid part of the team. And you added a nice splash of humor into the RP (basically becoming Roland in the process).</p><p>Ian: Quiet but supportive, providing the O2 needed for us to keep slogging forwards. Nice job.</p><p>Paola and Gioele were often quiet, and more than a little removed from my position in the bays. Nevertheless, their efforts were important (well, Gioele's maybe not so much <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>Mourn the ones we lost, and celebrate the time we shared. And, y'know... Keep being awesome people. Hope to see you all again.</p>

(i wasnt getting any relay in the end, not blaming the few actives who were trying to keep things together)</p>

                <p>I would have relayed you, but that game seemed like a sprint to achieve win conditions or die, that dropped the priority of research to me. Dropped the priority of plants too, when the hull's going to crumple in about a day, most likely, baby plants don't seem to have much to offer.</p><p>Gioele actually was planet scanning a bunch, using coffee for that purpose, and he found two non-deathtrap O2 planets, but unfortunately we had no diplomat, and both the planets had quite a few fights. Between the hull damage, the 2 pilots, the 8 active/semi actives, and the high chance all mush were dead, cleaning up and going home seemed the best choice.</p>
