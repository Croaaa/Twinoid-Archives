                <p>AP for sunday mushday ship <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8318" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8318</a></p><p>It has started with this <a href="http://i.imgur.com/b9FYxaW.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/b9FYxaW.png</a><br>And ended with this <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KuIsTrH.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/KuIsTrH.png</a></p><p>Although it was a short trip, but I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed my last casting RP ship.</p><p>I was Beta Jin Su, Ian was right. But before that happened, I planned to not do any mush hunting and just concentrate on roleplaying a commander who sees himself as most important, and unquestionable entity. ((First post was pre mush selection btw, Gioeles IM WATCHING ALL OF YOU cracked me up.)) <br>Alpha mushes: Terrence, Hua. (Not Raluca as Eleesha believed so for the second half of the game, lol)</p><p><strong>The Hunt</strong><br>Anyway, shortly after, Kuan formed mush hunting party and gathered the most incompetent ones inside of it - Derek, who lacked a good portion of brains instead of saying what he wanted to say, pointed at things shouting his name and playing with himself afterwards, Eleesha, who did a lot of stupid things ((New player so thats fine)) and me. I'm not sure whether it was a fake channel but I had a gut feeling that Kuan did it to fool us into thinking he wasn't mush.</p><p>Surprisingly, not many people were entering BD at all. Up untill D4C4 when I got converted, only 2 mushes - Hua, Terrence and 3 other humans have ever entered it(me Gio and Ral). Not even Kuan... I was genuinely thinking that one of the mush was a sleeper or avoided BD to make things harder for us.<br>I happened to have medkit, and checked both Hua and Terrence right after they showered to see they both had been injured. Should have acted then, but I didn't want to take out two pilots...</p><p>Eleesha printed list on around D3 which intel we kept to ourself If im not mistaken<br><em>Raluca, Hua, Gioele, Kuan, Eleesha</em></p><p>Janice kills human Raluca because Raluca reported having a cold, and we questioned whether it was true or not. She decides to heal test raluca 19 hours after that cold supposedly occured. Lol. I believed it was just a mistake, and that mistake tuned Janice into a monster. Once you get a taste of blood... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I also demoted her from her commanders assistant position, which she got after sleeping with me while us two were on an expedition. Diplomacy at its best. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Getting Better</strong><br>Anyway, it was D4C3 and we had a fire. Hua went out of BD and located it, but didn't try to extinguish it. I questioned myself, why? Good thing was that Ive spent most of the time In BD and tested myself on mysoscan prior to that. So after I grabbed extinguisher from RC and took care of the fires... I went straight ahead to the lab, and yep, just like I thought I had 1 spore on me. Who was in the corridor? Kuan, Gio, Hua. I come back to BD and lie next to Terrence and Hua. Not a big deal, Ian can remove the spore, and now the circle of mushes shrinked. Right? WRONG. After I write to Ian in private chat about it(I thought he was myco cause he rply said something about it, but had green thumb instead) I get a message that I am turned. So I immediately take anonymush and see what happened. They have defaced the BD logs. So now Ian knows that I had 1 spore, and the crew will sooner or later will find out that logs were defaced for some reason, meaning something nasty happened. A chance for a great mush win appears in my head. SOL with anon mush on board. That would be the first victory of this kind for me and I really wanted that to happen.</p><p>Terrence supposedly checks himself and says he has 0 spores. Damn. Now they are gonna thing that either I was mush... or that I got turned into one. Otherwise why deface, if not to spore and convert someone? Cover a screw up? Doubtable. So I decided to pretend that I got a second spore. As everything now pointed at Hua I had to make sure she died fast, or they might question whether I was lying and it was me who was alpha mush. ((Prior to selection I used soap a lot and was pretty careless)). So I pretended to be highly paranoid like a human in my situation would be, explained to mush hunters what I believed had happened and that there was no time to waste. In other channel Janice was raising same concerns, so I ordered her to kill Hua.</p><p>Heres Janices transformation. Before she gets a taste of blood, and after her 2nd murder. <br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/wtXUTVf.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/wtXUTVf.png</a></p><p>That tat... is priceless. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>After we were done with Hua I ordered everyone to work on mushicide soap and went out on a patroller, to "hide" from the second mush. That research went slower that I wished and I literally had to put myself in danger of being killed by hunters. Andie was dumping all her ap on all research instead of doing what I asked. We had 8 oxygen left by then, and despite having 2 astrophysicists(kuan and frieda), no oxygen planet was found. Priority was set to Research to finish the soap and save me. Muhauhahaah. Frieda found a planet with oxygen though, that had mankarog but didn't post jump details.</p><p>When I felt Hunters would strike me, I landed back and took AD bed, thinking, the hell with it. Terrence said he was going to grab oxygen and do some damage, and he did. I think he hid a couple of oxygen cells and tried to kill Janice. When I got online he was already dead and I only read his last private messages to me about his horrible injuries... He died of Sepsis and I wanted a revenge. He was right though, that someone was gonna go with him. Janice died of aphysication. Very convenient, concidering he targeted her in the first place..</p><p>As the showdown among Janice and Terrence took place in AD, I felt that smarter humans like Kuan would understand that I was a mush. Afterall, I had reported 2 spores, and instead of turning me and having a new partner right there, in AD, Terrence decides to kill Janice? Plus, Kuan was going to risk it and go on the mankarog planet to get that oxygen. I had to get rid of him. I was also sure that after I killed Kuan, the last tech on board, I was gonna go next. And then I remembered that Ian had a spore (from beginning of the game I think).</p><p><strong>Transfer</strong><br> It was D5C8, Kuan was on the Bridge, and Ian was supposedly in the lab. I knew he was going online only on C1. I was going to kill Kuan, transfer to Ian and kill my old body, saying "woah dude, too many mistakes, you deserve to die. <strong>Exhales thick smoke</strong>" mimicking pothead Ian that he was during this run. I had 11 ap. 6 ap to kill Kuan should be enough, another 3 to transfer into Ian. Knife and Armour was there and I grabbed them both. Came to BD first to wash and reduce health to 5 hp so it was easier for me to kill old body. I completely forgot that soap that was not there so I couldnt go to 1hp. (And I was afraid I might kill myself accidentally).</p><p>I went to the lab first to check if Ian was there, and he was. Bridge next. It took 7 ap to kill kuan and I was left with 2 ap, not enough for transfer (I know now that Ian pacifist doesnt work on transfer and it takes 2 ap). On his death message I wrote "Second mush is dead" thinking that they might buy that it was just a mistake. Then a couple of sad posts of how it all fell apart, and they did bought my innocence.</p><p><strong>Change of plans</strong><br>So I was going to wait 10 minutes after the cycle change, then drop items, transfer, pick Ians skills, pick knife and kill. <br>Ian should have had about 9 ap, and cycle change added +1hp so I was at 6hp. Even though we had 0 air I was concerned that I won't be able to kill Jin. Another idea came to my mind. There was a message about traders in the perimeter. I decided that Id better not stay on the Daedalus that was falling apart, and instead try to escape on board of that Transporter. What good would it make for me if I killed Ian? Instead I let him live and enjoy his last smoke. He got active at exact time that I expected, ~15 minutes after C1 and said he had 11 ap if he ate a ration and he could scan planets. Sure he could, but would I jump us? NOPE. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"> He failed too and I, with clear counscience, picked up cat, went out to AB2, to my favourite patroller E-Street that I spent so much time hiding from mush in and rp'ed blasting my way out through the side of the daedalus. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>After that Eleesha took command and tried to coordinate people to survive, but they had no chance. Partially reparing hull won them another 3 hours of life... After which, the hull reached 0 and they all died.</p><p><strong>Credits</strong><br>Thanks all that was fun. Derek, you were awesome. Makes me change my view on the character a bit to a better side. ((I hated him)) Raluca died too soon. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> Ian, Janice, Kuan, Eleesha thumbs up. I wonder what was happening in that second mush channel Eleesha told me after Kuans death. It was fulfilling to read that you "had planned everything" and I screwed it up. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
