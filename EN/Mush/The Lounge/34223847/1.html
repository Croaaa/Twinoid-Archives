                <p>Hi guys. I havent seen the AP thread of this ship yet <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1437" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1437</a></p><p>Eleesha alpha, first time mush here. I just wanna know what happened after me and Jin Su got killed. At that point Janice had 2 spores on her and Terry was turned to the darkside.</p><p>Janice was the biggest problem as I've expected - too smart and observant. Always stayed under that damn camera. If we'd turned you it would be very easy I think.</p><p>My epic screw up with the chat got me thinking that Ill probably never gonna speak mush things in private and use Mush Chat instead. It was Mush Thread Chat after which I've decided to not to use it - and in the result it turned out to be a bad decision. I blame my screw up on chat lag/bug, because I was aware of that I might expose myself and I still did it - wrote 2 separate messages to mush guy and they end up in other private, while the things i wrote to humans ended up in mush private.</p><p>Anyway, I'm glad Terrence managed to pull it off. <br>(Stayed a bit and read your messages, looked like he just played ultra unsuspiciously.)</p><p>Also after some thinking, realised that I could have made some things differently, like not wasting AP to kill Janice but instead grab armor and grenade and try to blow shit up. Also Janice could have been turned right after Terry if we would have waited just 1 cycle I think. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Oh well, you learn by making mistakes.</p><p>So, how did it all end?</p>

It worked well enough up until Terrence decided he wanted a bed in the dorms. Paola really wanted to kill him at this point but I got everyone to vote her down because we couldn't finish PILGRED without him. I planed to put him down after we had better confirmation and/or PILGRED done.</p><p>Once Terrence started ignoring quarantine, Stephan did as well and before you know it, those two are relaying PILGRED. They had so much contact, I figured one would have had ample time to spore the other by the time we made Stephan do a pill test, three days after. When that turned out negative, I began to think the mush was one of the others.</p><p>After I got spored, we coerced Stephan into killing Paola before killing him ourselves. The rest of the crew then spent their remaining AP failing to kill Terrence while I discreetly healed him and fed everyone spored fruits. With no one maintaining the ship, we all died soon after from asphyxiation.</p>

                <p>Damn, I was thinking you were Mush too. I knew I saw two on the counter (a bit after eleesha died) but you said that it was only one mush. Kuan Ti asked about this too and I think he also saw it. After Kuan gave up on the ship, I just went into full crazy Paola with nonsensical chatter because I knew the ship was fucked. There goes my golden ticket!</p>
