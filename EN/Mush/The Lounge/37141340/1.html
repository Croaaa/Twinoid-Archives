But kinda helpful too, because yes, later I was also Mush (real griefers can't throw grenades <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">). And then I was Eleesha.</p><p>My only regret is that I had to horribly murder <em>Janice</em>, who had been new to the game and extremely nice and helpful to me all along. But then I turned into a monster, and decided that having half of the crew massacred is even better without a shrink, so I personally went Brutus on her. Sorry Janice!!!</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_comp.png" alt=":mush_pa_comp:" class="tid_ico"> So here is how it went down from my POV.</p><br><br><p><strong>Chapter 1 - The grumpy human</strong></p><p>I started as <em>Raluca</em>, restraining myself a bit first, but quickly being useful and organizing stuff as I always do - because it is most likely to stay human, and even if not, it gives you some cover.<br>Also, I like Raluca because you get to talk to people from her point of view. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><span class="tid_preCite"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico"></span><cite>These idiots just get in your way the whole time. Seeing them waste their time on such pointless trifles causes you to fear the worst for the future of humanity...</cite></p><br><p><em>Janice</em>, as mentioned, was very helpful. And I did not lie when I said that I could have rushed PILGRED and returned to Sol right away, had I turned Mush, because at that point is was already at 50%, thanks to her help. And she gave me hugs. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Same goes for <em>Eleesha</em>, who was immediately on the hunt with <em>Chun</em> and me. And <em>Jin Su</em>, who did his best leading the ship. Little did we suspect at this point that he was playing the good Mush.</p><br><p>That changed when <em>Chao</em> shot <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"> <em>Frieda</em>, allegedly on his and Hua's orders - shortly after she had proven herself 100% human via food testing! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"><br>However, while that was a major screwup, the rest of their (then investigated) Mush hunter chat looked like they really just failed to see the legitimacy of her plan not to pick a skill yet - even though, or maybe because, she had been rather vocal and obnoxious about that very fact.</p><p>Most of all, though, <em>Chao</em> managed to divert so much attention with his increasingly irritating behavior that the main question in the wake of this became whether or not we should kill him just to shut him up. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I certainly would have, after he pushed for that insanely risky expo, with six people going and Jin Su still on the bridge. I was so itching to stab him then! And everyone was OK with it too.</p><p>The only reason I did not was because, at that point, I was a Mush. And I needed my AP.</p><br><br><p><strong>Chapter 2 - A new perspective</strong></p><p>How did I become Mush? Well... after we decided to kill our wandering <em>Finola</em>, which <em>Jin Su</em> heard, both of them simply WALKED STRAIGHT INTO MY TURRET and spiked me. Which NOBODY NOTICED.<br>Of course I was not going to say it then, but man... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It was kinda ironic, because shortly before, I had expressed my regrets not to be born a Mush with the way things were going on this ship. (No research, no projects, and Chao...).</p><p>So now my call was heard, and we were going to have some fun with that! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Of course we could still have returned to Sol right then, not even needing to possess the captain for it. And it would have given us the most <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"> as well. But with Jin and me already leading the crew, there were soo many options...</p><br><p>The best of which was certainly that expo. How glorious that would have been!<br>Sadly, <em>Jin Su</em> had messed up there - or the crew was just too fast. In any case, both of us had called everyone to Icarus bay. THEN he tells me that he is now going offline for the next 7 hours. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So then, of course, the crew acts unusually fast for once. Icarus XL has 5 people in it within an hour, and I start that nerve-wrecking discussion as to why you should not launch without the commander just yet. Grudgingly, I spill out all the (valid!) arguments to wait for him to join, and all the (real!) ways the Mush, meaning us, could otherwise exploit this to kill all of you.<br>- Except that I did say all this not for fear that he would come online and abandon you, but for fear that he would NOT! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But then <em>Hua</em> listened to Chao's clamors over reason and lauched anyway. And since the captain was already Mush, I could not possess him and move the ship myself, either. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>You were lucky that night.</p><br><br><p><strong>Chapter 3 - Apocalypse</strong></p><p>With that off the table, the O2 supply back form <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> 10 to <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> 32, and Jin having to leave for longer on D4, we basically decided to just murder everyone. So I got PILGRED to 95%, collected/built 2 grenades and did some interior decoration in A Dorm, with people's interiors. <em>Jin Su</em> joined in, I transferred into my trusted and competent friend <em>Eleesha</em> (sorry!) whom I had spiked before, and together we murdered <em>Chao, Janice, Raluca</em> (the real Eleesha), <em>Chun, Gioele </em>and<em> Terrence</em>. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Paola</em> walked in during all of this, looked around, and left again. Then wrote something about the signal. The "coverup" to all this was Jin shouting "Terrence is killing everyone!" and later "I am Paola in Jin's body!" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>Yet I think NOBODY actually checked what had happened in that room. Like that I had stabbed not only <em>Terrence</em> but also <em>Gioele</em> AS ELEESHA and had nothing to explain it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"><br>Thanks to a vomit-inducing disease <img src="../../../../gfx/square/puke.png" alt="°x°" class="tid_ico"> I had inherited from Eleesha, I actually got <em>Roland</em> to heal me up while we discussed how all of that was Jin Su's work, and what "we humans" should do about it.</p><p>The rest is history. <em>Finola</em> turned <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"> Mutant and stood in our dorm, which was a funny picture, being how everyone else was relaxing next to... it. <em>Jin Su</em> had "surrendered" his Armor to me as a sign of "goodwill" before <em>Paola</em> shot herself <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"> and thus solved the mystery, and he himself had taken Hard Boiled, so none of us Mush could really be killed by the 3 remaining humans. Even when not near <em>Ian</em>, who seemed blissfully unaware of all that was going on.<br>Back to full AP I got up, stabbed <em>Hua</em> to death on the bridge (that's what you get for launching that expo!!), and laid back down, still not sure whether that would be enough to give me away as the third Mush. Shouting "BATTLE ROYALE!" over the speakers and giving <em>Roland</em> a stab as well finally convinced him, but of course he couldn't do much.</p><br><br><p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p><p>As I am writing this, it is D6C4. The only people left on a broken and <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"> burning ship are Jin Su, Finola and myself (Mush), Ian, and a half-dead Roland. Somehow they have not died of depression yet, and we have just miraculously survived 9<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hunter.png" alt=":mush_hunter:" class="tid_ico"> Hunters firing at our 5 points of hull. That was strange, but this cycle will certainly be our last.</p><p>We did not realize our idea to go back to <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/planet.png" alt=":mush_planet_scanned_1:" class="tid_ico"> Sol as a Mush-only ship, as Jin is already gone by now, and Finola's current form does not go very well with keyboards. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>But that is fine. Humanity is doomed, and I am spending my last moments indulging in apocalyptic poetry as they despair and die.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/cgu.gif" alt=":anim_chart:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>It was a fun ship after all. I hope those who may have raged at the "griefer" Raluca understand now, and that this little diary made up for your troubles.</p><p>Especially Eleesha, Jin Su and Janice - I am looking forward to seeing you in our next life.</p><br><p><em>Your "comrade",<br>Raluca-Eleesha</em></p>

You risked all for your brothers and sisters stepping out onto this dangerous journey that would inevitably lead to our deaths. You knew the dangers and you stepped up to the challenge fully knowing the risks involved. <br>Your story ends here with you. No records of your deeds will ever return to Sol outlaying your bravery, courage, and sacrifice. You will miss out on any praise for your glorious achievements. But this adventure was more than. Those brave souls such as yourself did not come here seeking praise, rewards, riches or celebrity status... you did this because it was needed for our species to survive. It is regretful that what you have accomplished will die here with this ship. For your dead could have filled history books. It is with my last breath that I thank my fellow agents of mush. It was a great journey and you have made your Captain proud. May mush prevail! Captain Jin Su out.</span></span><br><br>Hello everyone that took part on voyage #3324. This is Jin Su (Alpha Mush) reporting in <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><br>I was really excited at the potential of this ship till I found out I was mush... I quickly realized that my days would be numbered quickly if I made any rash or risky moves. So in order to survive, this would have to be a long play game. <br><br>My first opportunity to strike came at the expense of Frieda who was being rather bossy on the main channel and not being very cooperative. When she stated she wouldn't do her job till the mush were killed, I knew she was my largest threat and had to be killed quickly. Chao was already suspicious and right fully so. I would have been too. I gave him a few words of encouragement and sent him after her. With his actions, there was one less mush hunter on the ship and it was human on human violence at that.<br><br>Racula stirred up the pot quite a bit drawing in a lot of attention on this. It really did force me to lay low for about a good 24-36 hours. I managed to trap a few shelves in the back of the ship and await my traps to go off before figuring out how to convert. It wasn't more than an hour later, Racula sprung a trap. Both Finola (Other Alpha) determined in 24 hours we would both strike out at Racula and convert her. It was extremely risky to do since I knew Eleesha covered all the room logs with a fine comb looking for trouble. I then took Anonymush so not to alert the crew. This must have been about Day 3.<br><br>You guys were extremely lucky on your first expo. I was trying to stall you guys from launching till I could be online so I could ditch six of you on the planet. Lucky for you guys, you managed to pull it when I was sleeping. My hat goes off to the human crew for pulling off the expo too, from out of orbit to boots on the ground looked to be about an hour. That is really really good. I've see my fair share of crews take 24 hours to get an expo going.<br><br>I pushed hard for NCC lenses because I infected the cat. I think only Paola was infected by that flea bag... it seems Chun saved the entire crew by working the project mostly by herself. Plan failed for the mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br><br>Well at this point, our ability to convert was nearly impossible with the research completed. People were dying off from starvation and the amount of Mush suspects became smaller and smaller. I knew Finola was about to be killed off by the mush hunters and I didn't want to see her die.<br><br>On D5 C4-5, Racula and myself launched our attack into Alpha Dorm. Grenades, Blasters, and knives were used to paint the walls red from the human race. We managed to kill off Chun, Gioele, and Chao. Racula then transferred into Eleesha and I killed the vessel that was Racula. During the stab fest, Paola made had me rolling on the ground when she stepped into the room. Hung out for a minute then walked out as if nothing had happened. Mean while a stream of names are flashing down the main channel of people dying left and right at our hands. Roland logs in and I blame a body transfer with Paola who appears to have gone off line. He spends what I assume most his AP/MP trying to figure out what happens. The ruse only lasts till cycle change when Paola dies of moral.<br><br>Now in Bravo dorm resides Finola (Mutated), Jin Su (Mush), and Eleesha (Old Racula/Mush) facing off against Roland, Hua, and Ian. Hua logs in, looks around, and splits without saying a word. He takes off in one of the fighters. I make my move to spare him a quick death by running to the Bridge to pilot the ship... only to be thwarted by an Arack.<br><br>Things slowed down a lot at this point as everyone was out of AP and were all sitting around waiting for three hours to pass so we could exchange a few punches only to wait for the next cycle. I think everyone was kinda hoping to be the next person to die. <br><br>Well it is now Day 6, Cycle 3. Half the ship is on fire, half a dozen hunters are attacking us, and two asteroid about to impact us now. The ship is at 5 hull and will be destroyed next cycle. We tried to make an effort to repair Pilgred, but our RL schedules wasn't going to let that happen. So I leave you with this AP as we sit here on our final hour waiting for the hunters and fire to finish us off.</cite></p>

                <p>Unlucky Frienda here and 1 of 3 chaos who killed me in a 3 day period in 3 different ships .<br>I don't have mush to say , besides that 1rst mush picked anonymous and 1rst suspects were Finola and Chao . Finola stayed clean at that day so i did not suspect her too much , but chao were acting strange . Few cycles b4 i got killed i did say to Eleesha that chao is most likely human , but will rampage at some point at it would be better to kill him b4 that as he is griefer ... Also my prime suspect were Jin su due to a certain thing he said and Eleesha can confirm that since i said all that to her in PM at day 1 . If not that Griefer , mush most likely would have been dead soon ... Sorry that i got killed <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Oh wait , ex eleesha since she lost her body . Well i wonder why did no one found mush ....</p>

                <p>The "Raluca" formerly known as Eleesha here. ^^ That was a fun ship, despite the losing to the mush. I had actually suspected Raluca, but couldn't come up with a good enough reason to go check the turret without getting suspected myself as Mush - which was a major fail on my part. Sigh.</p><p>I had actually been contemplating the prospect of a Jin-Raluca mush team up even. I think I kept getting hung up on helping out with projects, research, scanning, and whatnot and was distracted from wandering around and fully plotting out everyone's movements.</p><p>Still a worthwhile ship, even with all the post-it notes. ^^ There's probably one stuck to my remains. =P</p>
