Yeah, and the commander brought the crew to Eden.</p></cite><br><p>I am going to counter that claim, sir. Jin was nearly lynched for the killing of Paola and was confined to one dorm for a loooong time. And I will counter your caim that he got us to Eden too. The Eden achievement was a team effort. All the people who made it there pulled their weight and played their part.</p><p>In any case, <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/finola.png" alt=":mush_finola_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><em>Finola</em></strong> here.</p><p>I took a huge gamble by picking OCD pre-mush select as I was too lazy to go look for the Apron. It paid off as I was selected human.</p><p>Before selection, I secured the Grenade, Blasters and Knife in the Medlab. When our pretty much useless Chun woke up, she took the knife and hid it in a storage of all places <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> In any case, after selection happened, Chao took Torturer. I, along with Janice, Stephen, Gioele and I think Eleesha and Chun started blitzing through all that anti-mush research. Impatient Ian extracted a spore and claimed he tended to the plants without the apron that was sitting on the shelf next to our many pots. Chao was quick to act and found the Extraction via torture. Of course, we pitched in and tried killing the poor fellow. I read our starting Shooter book and dug out the 2 blasters aaaand... failed all 4 shots miserably. It was Paola who finished Ian off with the Blaster I left behind.</p><p>Since Ian was dead and we had plenty of Research completed, I, who started the Mush hunt chat with Chun, got added in a separate mush hunt chat(made by Chao, Paola, Raluca and I forgot who else <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico">) for "being trustworthy". So I told the crew that we should secretly research Pheromodem since it had been less than 8 cycles since selection. So we got to it and Gioele, who wasn't in the chat, started helping out whilst keeping the matter a secret. That is when I decided I could trust him.</p><p>In any case, we finished Pheromodem and saw no spikes and no conversions so we knew for sure that there was no beta mush. Once Pheromodem was over, our Jin Su went berzerk and killed poor Paola because the <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"> icon was Pink and <em>"Paola always types in pink" </em>. Of course, he blamed me for his killing Paola and I was frustrated and a lot of the crew were frustrated too and Jin nearly lost his life and was then deemed a "pariah" in a sense. Nobody trusted him and he was confined in a dorm as he was confirmed human by Janice (which was the only thing that saved him from the lynch mob). All in all, we had to explain to Jin that the Mush icon for the Mush chat has always been pink and that the Mushes are Pink and the Mush logo is Pink and well, the matter was settled. We could feel the loss though as Paola had been an amazing member of the crew up until the very end.</p><p>After this whole drama, we had to go on one expedition and that was when we got our first Map Fragment. At the same time, research was still progressing ata rapid pace and things were relatively quiet. For some reason, on top of the "mush chat" I had been invited to, my other 2 channels were forever being sought after and filled by various members of the crew sharing info and suspicions with me. For all it's worth, I think I was sort of a Chun stand-in and all thanks to my dedication to completing all that research.</p><p>At some point, Eleesha asked for permission to print the List as it had 4 names on it and, as it turns out, the 4 names were: Stephen, Kuan Ti, Finola and Ian. We were rather bummed out when we saw Ian's name on the List but all hope was not lost. I had ships where both Alpha Mush were on the List so I had a slither of hope that maybe either Kuan or Stephen were Mush. Both were suspected at various times for what looked like suspicious ations on their part. Stephen was Gold, Apprentice Stephen yet never moved out of the Lab and would occasionally push research. Other than that, he wasn't very active. He <strong>DID</strong> eat at the exact right moment to prevent starvation, but to me that was just clever mush play. So we started working on the RFS and, with approval from our little mush hunt chat, I injected Stephen with is. Aaaand.... he was human.</p><p>By the time Stephen was injected, suspicions of Kuan were dropped and our other suspects were Hua and somehow, Roland who had been doing a rather decent job on hunters but <strong>HAD</strong> made a bunch of mistakes that could make one look mushy. I was very bummed out that my prediction was wrong but then Kuan Ti killed Roland and we were suddenly Mush free. We had 1 map fragment and we were doing relatively well so we were on the path to Eden.</p><p>Gioele took the role of Botanist, Eleesha set us up with all the important bases and the Chun ghost and whatnot, I kept pushing the research, projects were going at a steady pace and PILGRED was rushed before I could even wrap my head around everything that was going on. As the designated Diplomat, I was on every single expedition and it sure paid off.</p><p>At some point, we had a major Oxygen and Fuel crisis, Chun and Hua had died to inactivity and the overall activity was in decline. Stephen Apprenticed Shrink and we had one Shrink in each dorm. I transitioned from research to healing and was doing as many healing rounds as I could. We had an insane bout of planet scans as we were very unlucky in finding suitable planets and, for a moment there, all our Eden hopes seemed crushed as our Oxygen and Fuel levels were dropping and, whenever we found OXygen planets, we would get a measly 8 oxygen and I'm pretty sure we got no oxygen whatsoever from one planet too.</p><p>After like two days of bad luck, the good planets rolled in and we managed to fill our Oxygen and Fuel tanks more or less. Sadly, Chao and Janice could not be bothered to be active anymore and they both died right as we got our 3rd map fragment, both of them for Depression. Which was sad because both were around the moment we got our 3rd fragment and neither reported their morale status so they pretty much knowingly threw away their Eden chance.</p><p>After we got our 3rd fragment, I had to rest for a few cycles as I was out of AP. Once I had AP, Super Calculator was completed and we got a couple of glory researches done but, we decided to give up on those and just go to Eden on D15C1 because it was becoming dangerously difficult to keep going since our numbers were very low and our AP bars were too.</p><p><em><span class="tid_wspoil">Oh and to top it all off, throughout the existence of the ship, I managed to sleep with Terrence, Stephen, Jin Su <strong>AND</strong> Kuan Ti on multiple occasions each but I had no luck at getting a baby <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico">. There was a bit of a drama scene going on once the four realized they'd all shared the same woman throughout the journey <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico">.

                <p>I woke up from cryosleep as <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Kuan Ti</strong>. The ship was pretty decent, nothing more, nothing less, I can't remember many details prior Mush selection.</p><p>I had a variety of useful skills to pick: astrophysicist, technician and leader. I could pick two of them. The ship was almost full but despite a couple of alleged technicians on board, alpha shower hadn't been dismantled yet. I decided to become a technician, dismantle the shower and build a sofa on the bridge. I was dirty and stayed on the bridge for AP recover because I expected dorm beds to be occupied. The last crewmember of the ship woke up.</p><p>Starting as dirty Mush would be a challenge, but I stayed human. I waited dirty on the bridge taking logistics from Paola until Frieda came. But before she did, I got to think that she was inactive, she wasn't there for a long time. During that time, Chao tortured Ian in the front corridor and found him extracting a spore. He claimed Hua was also tortured but he didn't find anything suspicious in her, despite having an opportunity to wash. I believed Chao but I didn't feel like fighting Ian with bare hands, so I looked for a weapon, in the radio. A knife was in a storage so I looked for the knife, even searched where Chun passed and found it. I made a cut on Ian but got exhausted. I informed in chat that I had the knife and they could ask for it to finish off Ian. I also advised NERON admin to turn off CorePeace so we could use grenades and asked shooters to use blasters. Nobody asked for the knife, CorePeace was still active but Ian was shot to death by Paola.</p><p>Once Frieda came to the bridge, I went to bravo dorm, hiding the knife in the central corridor on the way, washed and went to sleep as there were plenty of free beds in bravo dorm for the whole voyage. Chao didn't torture me, I started advancing projects and I got tortured afterward only to be checked that I was really advancing the projects.</p><p>Meantime, Pheromodem was made and I winked for a sign that I noticed the research being done, without informing the Mush about this. Shortly after, Paola was assassinated. My first reaction was a wonder, a wonder why Paola was killed. She was the least expected to be killed crewmember on board. She was neither a valuable entity or a suspect. This looked so stupid that I had to come to the bridge to see what had happened. And a little expected, Paola was attacked with 14-15 hits by Jin Su who had eaten a ration. I didn't know exactly how many and there was noise reducer, but I was certain he was human and didn't bother anymore, just went to sleep.</p>

                <p>I was told by Gioele to search for an oxygen planet, so I picked astrophysicist to help with scanning. I had to refuse a leader skill despite Janice being the only morale support on board. I couldn't find anything interesting, but Gioele found the first oxygen planet, which had 8 units of oxygen to take and a starmap fragment which we found. Another one was found by Frieda but she didn't scan completely. I didn't trust her as I noticed she didn't even eat to find a planet when oxygen was a serious issue, so I decided to scan on my own. I found a better planet than hers and we explored mine, which contained 16 units of oxygen to take. Frieda didn't hide her jealousy.</p><p>Shortly later, while I was wondering who the second Mush might be, I was invited into Mush hunt channel by Finola along with everybody she trusted, it means only Frieda, Hua, Roland and Stephen weren't invited, so this was similar as I thought, I couldn't say who else I trusted. We didn't know the Mush as everybody acts human and the Mush among us, so I felt the safe was not to care about the Mush and just focus on improving the ship. I advised about hiding the weapon and said it'd gonna be alright.</p><p>I was peaceful and let the Mush survive as long as it's calm, but things seemed to be turned against my favor. When the research team made Retro-Fungal Serum, Stephen was injected with it, not because they were certain he was the Mush, but because they were afraid of him, that he could have made a big damage to the crew during rampage if he had been a Mush, as solid apprentice when Chao was a wrestler. Chao had said before that Stephen was the last to wake up and picked 4 skills instead hiding his status. I also noticed he was decently helpful with research, but the team was scared that he could be preparing for a rampage. I was so annoyed that I wished a Mush transferred into Stephen and did this wrestler-solid rampage and perpetual peace. Moreover, Gioele suspected me for holding the knife and when I asked to be healed, he held the medikit and asked Chao to torture me. Finally, he healed me when I said I had full AP, thus I could self-heal in Medlab. I was gone into the state of vexation. Finally, Finola shared with us her suspicion of Hua and incited the Mush hunt team against her. I felt ignored as I had told them that Hua was a person I trusted and watching what she had done, I was certain she didn't deserve to be killed.</p><p>There were 4 confirmed humans: Jin Su, Stephen, Raluca and Chun. The rest of 10 crewmembers were active, more or less. The Mush was unknown and I let it be, but recent actions from the human team made me enraged. I made sure I trust every human on board, grabbed the knife I had hidden in central corridor and stabbed Roland to death for his total passiveness and not showing me a reason that he's not the Mush. Sorry, Roland, it's not your fault in point of fact. Due to getting Pheromodem early on, we knew we were Mush free. Gioele called me lucky which made me a bit riled up.</p>

                <p>Once I rested up, Raluca asked about her second skill to pick. We had PILGRED to fix and Plasma Shield project to advance. I told her to pick physicist over genius. We didn't need any project or research to push for one click, we had the toughest two tasks to do. Gioele was caffeine junkie, so we fixed PILGRED first, then we built a plasma shield.</p><p>Frieda found a cristalite planet. It contained intelligent life and some not important zones. I felt it was not worth to waste so much fuel just for a single fragment. But a bunch of crewmates wanted to visit the planet so I just showed being neutral so I wouldn't aggravate my competence. They visited, got some spores, alien bottle opener and my anger. Since then, I tried to make sure that every next planet won't be visited without my approval pointing out the failure on that planet.</p><p>But since then, despite fuel and oxygen issues... we had about a day to suffocate... I convinced the crew to assemble quantum sensors over extra hydropots and the crew found planets rich in fuel and oxygen... we needed them both at once... Once I was competing with Frieda who finds a better planet. I found a decent, small oxygen planet. Frieda found a richer, larger one. The crew agreed on Frieda's planet and Gioele froze to death there. Also, Frieda found a very rich planet that refilled our fuel and oxygen stocks. We've learnt that caverns give a decent amount of fuel in usual. Meanwhile, we found another starmap fragment and calmly searched for the third one.</p><p>There were no inactive people in the beginning, but mid-game Chun and Hua had been switched off and died. Once we found the third starmap fragment, Chao and Janice died due to morale issues. Stephen was the only shrink. The crew didn't feel confident to survive long. Once we calculated the coordinates of Eden, we bumped a little of glory research, tried to solve Mad'Kube (Terrence won) and stayed on the Bridge - the whole crew who lived apart from Stephen. Jin su just got impatient and clicked the button before I said the last word which I forgot.</p><p>It was a mediocre voyage, in my opinion, but Raluca asked who should make an AP thread and Frieda said my name and I felt this might be a good thread for these who reached Eden for the first time.</p>

Finally, Finola shared with us her suspicion of Hua and incited the Mush hunt team against her. I felt ignored as I had told them that Hua was a person I trusted and watching what she had done, I was certain she didn't deserve to be killed.</cite><p>The reason I was suspicious of Hua was the fact that it seemed Roland was overall killing more hunters and Hua was more or less inactive/very passive/pretty quiet and I sort of resigned to the fact that our remaining mush was playing the quiet game.</p><p>And I feel injecting Stephen was a good move because, as you said, if he was Mush, he would have felt cornered the moment RFS was completed and could have caused some serious damage in a rampage. To be fair, by the time I finished the RFS and injected him, I had already decided he wasn't Mush but, since several other crew members voiced their concerns as well, I chose to put everyone at ease and just go through with it.</p>
