                <p>Hi, Raluca here!</p><p>On this ship 4 of us humans got to Sol and won therefore after the mushes went out and failed with their rampage.<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9380" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9380</a></p><br><p>I joined this ship with not very much time to play and hoped it would be fine. <br>Actually we had many active players, but most of them were online only few times a day. <br>Our research went fine and the first mush Jin Su outed himself quickly by just removing a camera in a dorm, so it seemed not too dangerous.</p><p>Eleesha, who was a rather new player printed the list a bit too early but we were still lucky with it, becasue Jin Su was not on it and therefore all people who weren't on list were invited by Hua into a channel of probably humans / at least not alpha - mushes.</p><p>while pointing suspicions on almost everyone we didn't improve.<br>With rather low oxygen we found finally a planet. Buit when we wanted to start an expedition, the hacker kit seemed to be away. Just seemed... some people said they don't knwo where it is and I knew Derek used it the last time (it turned out afterwards Hua took it to safe keep it probably during expedition) . Also I knew Derek was holding the knife, he was on Eleesha's list and he was inactive lieing in Bravo Dorm. So after we failed the opportunity to sell him while we had trader ship before moving to the planet, I went to kill him then and secured the knife. Unfortunately Derek was human and Hua was a bit angry at me for killing him while not having much evidences and Derek was new player and so she excluded him being mush. Well, I have no idea what is with these chances and was also happy to get knife and remove a possible transfer victim. While though being inactive he maybe could have returned of course...<br>anyway.</p><p>After some days we got even plasma shield and since i had during this ship most of the time a bed, it was also finished rather quickly and helped us in the end well.<br>Also research went quickly, I actually suggested the researchers Ian and Andie to do serum, but ian wanted to do pheromodem and this project was pushed and at high progress..</p><p>Then Roland went out and did a rampage. <br>It seems he thought we suspected him while actually mush hunt was not really progressing. with my limited time I also didn't pay much attention and while saying that Roland is only one who coudl actively spore people, but only with very high levelled mush skills and probably being gold I didn't dig into it. Hua also cnsidered him in beginning, but we didn't speak about him actually recently before the rampage. At that time Hua suspected Ian and I suspected a bit Paola sicne I didn't see her eating for long time, but go the information that she actually did in the end.<br>I was actually also surprised why Roland rampaged then. There seemed to be no reason - was it paranoia at the mushes side? ^^<br>we were not in a too critical situation (oxygen level was high) and we had not that many hunters (only 5) while having plasma shield.<br>anyway, with his rampage he killed Hua, a technician pilot. It was just at teh time I wanted actually go to sleep... and left me awake then for 2 hours more.<br>Together with Eleesha I planned to kill him instantly with our secured knife, which went completely easy since Roland didn't hide behind Ian (Now in the hindsight I understand it. check who else was mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> ). But after killing of Roland still a mush was visible in the mush bar...so Roland was an anonymush and seemed to have been successfull in converting someone.</p><p>With Eleesha I communiacted and wanted to find out whioch person Roland may have infected, but in no room logs were missing... in garden Eleesha noticed Roland entering and leaving before a mycoalarm was placed there (we had a garden project so plants were moved there). <br>At that point my tired brain just thought he may have spored a banana there, but when I check the log NOW again, which Eleesha sent me online (and after confirming with checking end page), I realized that Ian was standing in garden while Roland visited it xD So probably Roland directly infected Ian there! Eleesha-we coudl have seen it all along! But we just missed it xD<br>I really didn't think about ian being mush, especially sicne he still pushed to work on pheromodem.</p><p>Anyway, it goes further: the banana Roland coudl have infected was carried by Ian to lab so we checked lab log (still thinking Roland may have spored the banana and not Ian doing that). Here we realized even that first Stephen and then Terrence had an eating log afterwards. But the banana conversion theory was dismissed a while afterwards. <br>why? soon. First, someone finished pheromodem and no conversion log could be seen so everyone felt actually quiete more safe.</p><p>But only several hous/cycles later Ian did a rampage too! <br>yeah...he mutated and killed Andie, leaving only silent Stephen as pilot (and a pilot book, which was in hold by Janice). Again, assassination of mush happened quickly .. and it turned out Ian was an anonymush too! Still a mush left. <br>And with Ian being anonymush it seemed weird that a conversion shoudl have happened via banana, since normally a person eating a banana would take anonymush, right?</p><p>But still we had not much time to think about it.<br>After a while Stephen rampaged too and killed with use of transfer Janice, himself and Terrence (who had onyl robotic expert).<br>When he was killed, finally no living mush was visible anymore.<br>Stephen didn't say a word the whole game, but his rampage was effective...just sarnge choice of targets.<br>Because we had even two technicians (myself and Kuan Ti) in the end.<br>Though Kuan Ti may have been inactive in the end actually. Anyway, it was possible for me to finish pilgred with help of Eleesha, then paola and eleesha tried hacking us to Sol.<br>End of story.</p><p>So...such a great start of mushes, but such an unexpected end. How did it went like that? somehow the mush actions seemed a bit uncoordinated in the end- lucky for us humans!<br>I can still say it was an interesting and tense game though!<br>In the end I was much more active sicne the situation went that difficult then.<br>Janice, thank you very much for hugging me multiple times shortly before you were killed! While even Gioele, who was an active and helpful player died by demoralization I still had 6 morale left then <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I will mention soem people though I probably forget some.<br>Gio was helpful and nice, but sometimes it was not clear whether he said something as RP or really.. I guess his end message was also meant not seriously, Eleesha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>Janice was also very nice and while having not much time to play, when she was online she was always doing fine and is probably an experienced player.<br>Hua, you seem a bit cocky to me with your " I know it all" - attitude (slightly exaggerated <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> )anyway, you were very active and a driving force and therefore important - msuhes decided to kill you first in the end.<br>Ian, you were enjoyable and I liked also to communicate with you after you mutated. Maybe that rampage was not the solution though, I guess if you just would have stayed hidden, mushes would haveprobably won - Eleesha and me failed to notice you being converted after all.<br>Probably we would have killed Stephen at one point (since he alos didn't kill any hunters anymore), who was not anonymush and then we woudl have been convinced to be mush - free and returned to sol with you on board and mush team woudl have won!<br>As anonymush you better shoudl just let Stephen do the rampage alone... but probably there was also no communication with Stephen in mush chat, hm?</p><p>Roland, you were very quiete and so it happened also I forgot about you a bit xD. But you were doing your pilot job very well, I wonder how you managed to save so many ap for mushy activities.<br>Eleesha, I liked to collaborate with you the mush hunt. if we would have started it sooner and with more time to think about it, maybe we would have been able to even find the mushes, even if they wouldn't have done a rampage. It was fun to discuss with you and you did very well though being a new player, my personal favorit therefore! But that may be a bit mean, I enjoyed the whole ship and therefore every player, even when I didn't mentioned them (well, Jin Su, Chun and Frieda were not tat useful. Maybe Frieda used even many ap for scanning, but then she was very unlucky and she was also very quiet.)</p>

                <p>So hua here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <br>Ye i am just against killing humans too much and it was a low low chance that Derek was mush anyway + a new player who still had allot to learn even if he went inactive (he were at full HP and was french player doing his 1rst ship in english server) . We could have either sold him or he could have woken up , but its unclear if it was the right decision or not killing him (but i must agree that there would have been allot more damage if mush were to transfer to him).<br>Seeing how mush went on a rampage i can say this - either mush panicked seeing how someone got killed and decided that its time to act or they were cut off from a transfer to derek for more effective rampage.<br>I did suspect ian the most thanks to banana being dropped in lab and him going to wash around the same time. Sadly did not check garden and no one else did <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>Roland did a great job as a pilot and i had literally nothing to do as a pilot most of the time . He went to the bridge area multiple times to reestablish connection which could have been to spore units as well . I had a thought that if he were mush i would get converted / infected 1rst since sniper helmet was left in a bay and i had used it few times . <br>Stephen - we wanted him dead for a while since he was really silent and did not do much and removed nexus camera b4 game start for some reason.<br>Hua - missed a sample in nexus and panicked a little there <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Were really sleepy at the time , sorry about that . That hacker kit was missing since i have hidden it b4 expo just in case .<br>Gioele was a good player , but expo did not go too well, had a suspicion on him at the time , for few cycles <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And he visited BD after finding mush sample on an accident - my fault partially as he himself said, if i would not have missed sample he would have stayed in the bridge .</p><p>Glad that you guys killed all the mushes and went to sol even thought voyage got shortened and just 4 of you made it.</p>

                <p>Hi Paola there !</p><p>Derek was not a new player, he was a French who launched a ship in English mode instead of French one. And he did not speak English, tried to understand with Google Trad but lost patience and left. So it was his first ship in English mode but he wasn't new <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Well, I was not very implied in the mush hunt, that's quite difficult with all my AP going to communications !

                <p>Alpha - Mush Roland here.</p><p>This game started for me with a Partner Mush who was active but not talking a single word. He managed to spore Janice. My starting plan was to play human with just save actions here and there.<br>As a gold player i had chosen Mycelium Spirit, Fertile and Trapper quite soon, leaving the last spot for anonymush.</p><p>My first trapped Shelving Unit in Front Corridor touched Ian - with a starting spore he had 2 spores to that time. He was standing in the garden so i just walked there an spiked him and took anonymush. But because of my RL work i have quite high offline times, next time i checked in Ian had converted Stephan with a double spored banana. He was anonymush, too. All the time i tried to convert Hua with my units but i just managed to infect him once.</p><p>So you were right, i was quite sure that i was target of the mush hunters. To many things had gone wrong for me.</p><p>First was that someone picked up the medikit shortly after mush selection and quite directly after my hidden shower. For me this was the first alert. But showering without heal and splashproof brought me to beneath 10 hp without excuse.<br>Second fail from me that i have eaten by way to late. My biggest fail was that i had thought ian is quite save. I was sure you would get Stephan but i was hoping that Ian managed to get it to sol, so i rampaged and killed one of the good mush hunters.</p>

                <p>thx for your answers. Well, Ian woudl have been save, he rampaged before we even suspected him being mush. <br>We might have come to conclusion that Stephen may be mush and assumed you spiked the banana, which Ian picked up in garden and brought to lab (and not that Ian was mush who spiked it and brought to lab then).<br>so after stephen's killing and if Ian would still have seemed human I think mush would ahve won. <br>I don't know whether we would have studied log messages carefully again + would ahve been convinced by another explanation, that is all uncertain <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hi, Janice here, sorry I'm late to the party! The only time I forget to check for an AP thread is the time one was made..</p><p>I was very upset that I couldn't be more active as this ship had an extremely unique mush team <em>(it's hard to play mush when you suddenly don't have a computer!)</em> <br>Anyway, as the half active Janice I was, I somewhat felt like the mush hunters were keeping an eye on me, so I purposely avoided bravo Dorm <em>(as every good human should! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> )</em> but being as active as I was made me feel disconnected with the crew, which is sadly going to make my story rather short.<br>For the first few days I didn't really suspect anyone, and I almost exclusivity stayed in camera protected areas, which makes me curious on how Jin spored me, I assume with trapper!</p><p>When Eleesha printed her list, it surprisingly created a big list of trusted people, which I was skeptical at first, but after hearing the reasoning, I was convinced! One funny moment for me was when I noticed Hua had read a magebook, which I wasn't aware of <em>(she did make it known, and was approved)</em> So I told her how magebooks still should be reserved for after the mush hunt as magebook skills are lost if you are transferred or killed, and then not even an hour after I said that, she was killed! At first I thought that someone must have been a beta mush in the "human" channel and passed on the information, but I just shrugged it off as a coincidence.</p><p>When Ian rampaged, I still had high hopes for the ship as we had 2 Technicians, 1 potential Diplomat, A pilot magebook, and logistics Paola who could give this "future" pilot plenty of AP.</p><p>Until Stephen woke up from being highly inactive and transferred into Me. Did I mention I hate the character Stephen for no particular reason? Now I have that character plastered onto my history page! <em>( I know nobody would even care if they checked my ship history and saw Stephen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ) </em> Anyway after I was killed, I still noticed that out of everyone the Mush killed, 2 Technicians were still alive, and with the amount of Mush dead, and Pheromodem active , it was almost implied that there could be no more Anonymush, which as I thought, would make an easy return to Sol victory.</p>

                <p>Nice thread!</p><p>Hello people, i was Ian. Sneaky-mushroom Roland got me.<br>I spiked the banana twice, and brought it to medlab.<br>Stephen ate it, but didn't decide to become anonymush. No one had seen there were 3 mushies for 15 min, so i became anonymush.</p><p>In fact, Stephen didn't do a single mush action. He didn't speak at all. When Roland died, i've waited for 1 more day but Stephen was doing nothing at all. Then i was fed up because i knew i was suspected. I rampaged and killed a pilot. And i took more pleasure to try to manipulate you with such messages : <strong>You know, still one mush is hidding, he is very powerfull...</strong> Cause i could imagine you would be looking at everyone. As Stephen was silent, i would have been you pleased you would killed human beings to find last mushie.</p><p>Then i died, and i saw in logs that Stephen rampaged too. My plan collapsed. <br>Stephen, you were such an idiot <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>That's all folks for now <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

And Hua was dead already, you were the anonymush, so you shoudl have stayed hidden and just Stephen shoudl have done the rampage.<br>But as we see now, there was no communication possible with him, so i understand.
