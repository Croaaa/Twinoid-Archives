                <p><strong>My character: Hua<br>Other characters: Chao, Jin Su, Ian</strong><br>Everything look OK, we are prepared for start. Wish us luck!<br>...<br>After fierce discussions, we decided to land in the vicinity of the equator. Chao is very impatient and bother me in piloting.<br>...<br>Now we are looking for a place to land.<br>...<br>I find a good spot to land. I see some kind of stone buildings. Easy ... Easy ... Chao! Don't open a window! Uh ... &lt;the sound of a hard landing&gt;<br>...<br>We are here ... Air smell ... sweet. Chao and Ian went examine those buldings.<br>...<br>They found nothing, except few skeletons. Ian, why are you all in the mud? Eh...<br>...<br>&lt;few minutes later&gt;<br>What going on! It was so &lt;shzzz&gt; ... and now &lt;shuuu&gt; ... Chao! &lt;The rest of the recordings drowned out by the wind&gt;<br>...<br>Here, powerful windstorm unleashed from nowhere. Chao fell from a small cliff. He's fine, but his blaster misplaced somewhere. We search for it, but it disappeared. It's a shame. Eh...<br>...<br>We found weird blue crystals near ruins. All plants near them are dead. Have the impression that they suck the heat from the ambient, there is so cold. I see 5 cristals arranged so that they form a circle. Ian? Ian! Don't touch them!!! Where he is?! He just disapear!<br>...<br>We looked for him but there is no sign, I have no idea where he is moved by the crystal, but hopefully not to another planet. We must find him!<br>...<br>Finally we got to the jungle! As we expected there is here an eternal summer, the trees are full of fruit. But look different than those from Earth and Mars. I very much regret that Ian isn't with us!<br>...<br>We started to look for some edible fruits ... Jin Su was unlucky ... now he vomits behind a tree.<br>&lt;few minutes later&gt;<br>Yey! I find two, promising fruits. But without Ian I'm don't sure. I'll take them into ship.<br>...<br>Jin Su: This was a great loss today, everyone gather as much of those fruits you can and let's not push our luck. We need to return to the Daed.. HUA DON'T LOOK UNDER THAT ROCK!<br>...<br>What Jin?<br>&lt;cut hand with stone and looks up&gt;<br>Oh my God! OH MY GOD! It's Ian. Hanging on one of the trees, riddled with sharp branches. It's can't be true! And this puddle of blood &lt;crying&gt;<br>...<br>Chao pulled him out of the tree &lt;sniffle&gt; we arranged him a modest funeral ... Ian, we will miss you.<br>...<br>We managed to find a clearing in the middle of the jungle. There are a horse like creatures seem an easy target. Jin is going to shot to them.<br>...<br>Run! RUN! ... They are ... too resistant &lt;breathing loudly&gt; ... Jin, run faster, you are staying in the back! No! He just fall down! ... They attack him!<br>&lt;one minute later&gt;<br>Shot from Blaster frightened them finally. But Jin arm ... doesn't look good. He should take care of it after returning.<br>...<br>There is message from Icarus: "Getting the oxygen out of the air end successfully. Tank full. Tank tightness 98%"<br>...<br>Jin wound bleed a little ... It gathers around us a lot of flying insects ... What is it? A bird? No! It's something like a mosquito and is the size of a cow! Everybody down! Chao! CHAO!<br>&lt;few minutes later&gt;<br>Chao pounced on this thing. He fight like beast. Now this mosquito is dead, but Chao have minor wound on his ass &lt;giggle&gt;. It could end up worse. We are going into location of Icarus.<br>...<br>We try to avoid jungle in our way back. We found a small valley with weird bushes. Their fruits are cubic and ... taste great. We'll take a few with us.<br>...<br>Ok, I see Icarus ... It was a very difficult and sad trip ... I am glad that we can come back.</p>

This planet have funny color ... like purple cotton candy, very hot cotton candy. We fly in silence, everyone is tired of the recent events on the ship. We decided to land near one of the desert settlements, but we need to look closely to make the final decision. I hope they will welcome us with music and food, not swords and blasters.<br>...<br>During the flight through the atmosphere Icarus began to collect oxygen from the atmosphere. However, it is quite sparse so reservoirs are filled only in 2/3 ... but I think that is good news! ... Roland looks very focused, I say to you, in front of us almost nothing you can see!<br>...<br>Roland began to approach the landing attempt ... What's going on? Wind has gained in strength! We deviate from the course. Roland! Hua, grab something!<br>&lt;background noises&gt;<br>&lt;few minutes later&gt;<br>It's ok now, nothing bad happend, maybe I have a few small bruises. We didn't expect such strong sandstorms. Now we are looking for a new place to land.<br>...<br>We found a nice field of sand to land, it is several dozen minutes from the nearest village.<br>...<br>The landing happened without problems ... as hot in here! Besides, hard to breathe. We set out to the village, but it will be pretty hard, we have a lot of equipment.<br>...<br>This heavy armor doesn't help me! The feet sinking into the sand! &lt;gasping&gt; ... how long will it take? Gezz...<br>...<br>We're close, Roland, do you see anything? What are you going? Ah, get down! It's a trap! &lt;gunshots&gt;<br>&lt;few minutes later&gt;<br>I am glad that we were prepared. Attacked us monkey like creatures. We were fortunate, they have used only simple bows, we walked out of this with only minor scratches. Now I'm glad that I have this armor! We have to move on ... Finola not hesitate! Moves! I don't want to be eaten by monkeys.<br>...<br>I didn't expect to be so slow to move in deep sand. We can clearly see the village, but it will take us a little more to reach it in this heat. Finola, don't linger! Hua give her a bottle of water. &lt;sigh&gt;<br>...<br>It's too hot! Roland looks very pale, Finola no longer has the strength to linger, and Hua seems to look ... smaller. I'm getting stronger dizziness, we are not adapted to such hot. I feel nauseous! Give me some water!<br>...<br>&lt;rapid breathing&gt; certainly we get burns here ... my skin itches me!<br>...<br>We reached the outskirts of the village ... we need to rest. The rest hid behind a rock in the shade, but I decided to look around.<br>...<br>What is it? Something like a entrace to the cave ... Everybody, come here!<br>...<br>Wow! just wow! Down here full of strange plants growing, which I haven't seen yet. Most of them shining with their own light! Many of them have fruits. There isn't anyone who knows about it, so I pick up a few random. I hope it isn't a mistake.<br>...<br>They ... &lt;rapid breathing&gt; it was second trap! ... They attacked us when we left the cave ... &lt;sigh&gt; again they didn't have a chance ... we hid back into the cave ... when one appeared at the entrance immediately fell dead ... sniper rifle is a really good thing! Again, this only left with scratches, so Raluca unnecessarily worried. Finally, we must examine this village, I'm starting to have enough of these traps and the heat!<br>...<br>In the end they understand that, they have no chance. When we came to the village they began to flee in panic. I do not know what to expect, but Finola found only, in one of the huts, a little of strange-smelling meat. Better than nothing. We all have enough of this planet ... We head towards Icarus ... &lt;sigh&gt; loaded with more than before, damn ...</p>

                <p>I've done something similar on some of my earlier ships. I think it adds some great color.

                <p>(at the last minute I decided to take part in this expedition, so it is even more improvised)</p><p><strong>My character: Kuan Ti<br>Other characters: Roland, Freida, Jin Su</strong></p><p><strong>Musheoine audiolog</strong><br>Daedalus expedition n1<br>Personal expedition n3<br>...<br>From what I noticed planet like earth. However, there is a lot more hot and humid, so the main vegetation on the planet are mushrooms, hence the name of the planet ... is quite unpredictable environment. Also detected were forms of life, it is interesting what we found there. We are just looking for a place to land.<br>...<br>The atmosphere of the planet is quite dense so the landing is extended ... radar detected a little flat land so Roland and Jin had just driven there. Freida help them. With so many experienced pilots we must do it good!<br>&lt;a few minutes later&gt;<br>&lt;laugh&gt; ... strange, this square was the middle of frog people village. They fled in panic &lt;laugh&gt; ... it looked like fun ... we were be able to find a lot of food, especially meat abandoned by them ... we packed it on a ship and move on ... Roland! Don't eat that! We don't know yet what it really is ...<br>...<br>&lt;a few minutes later&gt;<br>Uh! what it is! I don't see anything &lt;shhhh&gt; ... winds tend to be very ... &lt;kzzz&gt; very strong here ... oh! something hit me! &lt;sozzhh&gt; wind carries plenty of things, in particular a dust and considerable bits of plants... &lt;ksshh&gt; we must be careful, something bigger can hit us too! ... I see some rocks in front of us! &lt;bzsss&gt; ... we can wait out the dust storm there!<br>...<br>The storm quickly passed and we walked out of this with only a few bruises ... I'm glad I'm wearing this armor, though it wasn't give me much ... before us extends plain where exactly you can see the scale of destruction caused by the storm. The area looks wet and unstable, covered with broken mushrooms.<br>...<br>Breaking through this crap we found few intact fruits brought by the wind. I know that it is wrong to eat things from the ground but here we have little choice. Although Roland doesn't very like this idea ... He is still a little sick after eating those frog's things.<br>...<br>Unfortunately, the way is blocked by rocks ... we could not find any other crossing than the narrow tunnel ... on the way back we choose the route that bypasses the area, but now we have no choice.<br>&lt;a few minutes leter&gt;<br>&lt;sneeze&gt; here is terribly cold and wet ... although it is definitely not a water because it stinks. Personally, after a trip on this hot planet, rubbing up against the icy rocks made ​​me a thermal shock. Others also don't look good ... Fortunately, we can already see the light at the end of the tunnel ... although it take us a while because Jin was stuck and we have to push him ... on three!<br>...<br>We went to an area overgrown with bushes-like mushrooms ... the first thing that caught our eye is a great caterpillars located in almost every bush. We wanted to leave this place as soon as possible but Jin said that they are similar to some caterpillars on Earth and ... ate one before our eyes! Now it's been five minutes since this event and Jin looks as good as before. He collected a bag of these insects and then to the relief of the rest of the team went on hurriedly toward the Icarus taking circuitous route.<br>...<br>I received a message from Icarus: "Failure. Pump outlet obstructed, too high concentrations of dust in the air. Critical failure. Filter inactive. Pumping oxygen inhibited. Needed manual repair."<br>Guys ... we have a problem ...<br>...<br>Life on this planet still surprises me. We hide behind stones and just in front of us is a strange creature hovering above the ground and the size of an elephant. I can't compare it to any animal of the earth. It slowly nibbling a mushroom. We'll try to hunt it.<br>...<br>After one shot from a blaster it exploded like a big balloon! I cut out many strips of meat from his corpse. It doesn't smell delicious, but it should be edible ... at least a little.<br>...<br>This planet is really strange, smelly and uncomfortable. We were too loaded down with meat, to go on, so we go back straight to Icarus. Now we have a long journey through the wilderness. Unfortunately, the wind picked up ... the air is full of dust ... or of spores. I prefer not to be sure what is it. &lt;cough&gt;<br>&lt;a few minutes later&gt;<br>&lt;gasping&gt; We already packed meat and we can go back ... Certainly I won't come here on holiday!</p>

Our expedition is aimed at pumping oxygen, but nothing stands in the way to look around a bit. With luck Janice should have a chance to get along with the natives. I'm worried about Stephen, he could scare any badass, even more peacefull shepherds.<br>...<br>For a long time we could not find any of the camps. We're going for some time in the near promising mountain range.<br>&lt;few minutes later&gt;<br>Freida just inform me about our oxygen pumps status. It is great! We have full tanks! And in such a short time! Stephen complains that we should go back, but we decided that we should find at least one of these camps and get some food. So ready and steady. We lower the pitch~<br>...<br>We managed to find one of the camps ... But Janice convinced us not to land right next to their homes, but further and hide the ship somehow.<br>&lt;few minutes later&gt;<br>We found one of the lakes ... It looks terribly muddy and not encouraging. We landed behind some high bushes. We prepare to leave. <br>&lt;next few minutes later&gt;<br>Ah! It's so cold! Do not take suits was not a brilliant idea. Stephen went to look for some fruits or animals in the bush, but looking on these miserable and dry plants I wouldn't count on it. Eh, I feel worse and worse and I start to feel sick~ &lt;sneeze&gt; ... khem ... I think I caught the flu or a cold, I'll have to look for some drugs when we get back.<br>...<br>In the end, we were able to meet the locals! at the beginning of frightened us and started waving at us with sticks, but Janice was able to convince them to be quiet, and to even get along with them. They look strange - tall, green skin color with some gray, a bit like insects. They invited us to their ... tent? mud hut? I do not know what to call it. When Frieda and Janice talked with them in the middle, I and Stephen started to browse jugs and urns in front of the house. In one of them found a strange gel ... animal product? The juice of the plant? ... We took a little from it, it is worth to be examined in Lab.<br>...<br>I hear from the middle a argument! Some vessel is shattered! I wonder if we should enter. We'll wait a while, but we're ready.<br>&lt;few minutes later&gt;<br>Janice was able to defuse the situation. They agreed to share their supplies with us, so we are now laden with meat. The quarrel was caused by the fact that Frieda wanted to negotiate a couple of steaks more, as you can see she managed to do it &lt;giggle&gt;. Now we are leaving the village and will examine the surrounding hills, but soon we'll have to get ready to return.<br>...<br>In the mountains ... in thin clothes ... &lt;chattering of teeth&gt; it was not a brilliant idea ... here is very cold... Stephen began to complain about frostbite. &lt;sniff&gt; ... By ​​Frieda's idea at least we don't go against the wind ... but still we are terribly freezing ... it's not far from here, you're just at the foot of the hill.<br>...<br>We're here ... terribly empty here ... nothing. But wait! Frieda found something!<br>...<br>Roots? What is interesting in them? ... Oh! She just ignite them with a lighter ... they burn as hell ... Perhaps they can be readily converted into fuel. Well, we have a drill, we can bring them more! We pack how much we manage to lift and start to go back to the ship. It was a really successful trip! I walked out of there really alive.</p>

We need to get oxygen as soon as possible. Everyone is impatient because we don't know what we find there. Icarus goes inside of the thick clouds, soon we should see land ...<br>...<br>As expected under us until you see what everywhere stinking marsh. Hua probably find a more flat place to land, because descent flight.<br>&lt;few minutes later&gt;<br>Wow. We are surprised diversity of vegetation. Even in such a bleak world flowers are colorful. Hua had disappeared ... probably get hungry and went to look for fruit. Ian can not stop to admire the discovery of new plant ... what am I doing here? ... Terrence? Terrence! Stop drown yourself in that little pond! Throw me the rope!<br>...<br>Ian recognized one of the fruits as Jumpkin, it is known throughout the universe a very nutritious delicacy. I have no idea why it grows on the abandoned planet by a god. Others he will examine on the board. We loaded fruit on Icarus and set off ...<br>...<br>Night approaching ... except that here still stinks terribly it also gets cold! &lt;sniffle&gt; ... I do not know why we moved here without protective clothing! ... as it goes on we will lose a lot of heat ... What we will do if Terrence freeze into his wheelchair? &lt;giggle&gt;<br>...<br>It's getting more and more wet and muddy. We must help Terrence because he start to can't move using his own strenght. Something I do not like the direction in which we are going.<br>...<br>Hua and I went to reconnoitre. Before us stretches a big lake and we are knee-deep in mud, blech. We have to work around it and find another way. I have had enough of these marshes, I have even preferred to something will jumped out at us ... at least I'd forgotten about how stinks here.<br>...<br>I didn't say this seriously! Really! Something before the moment came out of the swamp and caught Terrence leg ... At first he felt nothing but trouble began when something started to jerk him on all sides ... Ian killed it with Blaster's precision shoot. Well, that Terrence has no feeling in his legs because the wound does not look good ... But he says it's nothing and can go further. However, someone SHOULD watch it after returning ... and now we have to quickly leave this place, can be more of them, lurking here.<br>...<br>Message from Icarus:<br>Low efficiency of the pump. Filter overloaded. Error. Too high concentrations of ammonia. Error. Pumping oxygen inhibited. Fault, required manual restart. <br>...<br>It isn't look good, we have only little of oxygen~<br>...<br>To escape from the possible threat from the swamp we were able to spot a near hill.<br>&lt;few minutes later&gt;<br>It was a good idea but the rock is terribly fragile. Uh. It is hard to climb up and even more difficult because we have to pull together Terrence and his wheelchair. Eh. Arrg, it stuck again! On three, pull! One! Two! What? Ian! Ian, take my hand!<br>...<br>It was dangerous, Ian dropped because the cliff slid ... well his rope was tied to a wheelchair and wheelchair stuck. It save Ian. It isn't high there, but at least it is not battered aimlessly. Nice view ... but what I see in front of us ...<br>...<br>... mountain glade on of which graze in a rat-like strange animals, but the size of a large dog. Ian said that should examine one of them. <br>...<br>There was a moment, and one of them lies dead ahead. I didn't know that Ian shoot so well. We threw the corpse into the back of the wheelchair. If it won't be anything interesting in it, we can eat it later. Although it doesn't look delicious ... eh. However, I don't know whether this 'mush' from the Refectory is better.<br>...<br>Ah, those little villians had to smell blood. Something was cover Terrence and started to bad bite him. To get rid of it threw him to the nearest puddle ... he never looked happy, but now it looks like the 7 woes. Terrence has really bad luck. But what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. I hope it won't kill him~<br>...<br>We decided to get back to the ship! Terrence condition is not good. We went through a shortcut which unfortunately ended up wade through overgrown by thorny plants swamp ... Fortunately, the ground is so hard so it is easy to push a wheelchair ... oh ... I feel dizzy. Something is not right. My your hands are shaking and I feel sleepy. I remember ... once I read about it ... a SmallPOX ... old disease stopped at Sol ... why exactly I had to catch it? Give me your hand Hua, I feel faint.<br>...<br>Finally we reached the Icarus ... Comparing the Daedalus of this planet, our ship is a palace full of luxuries! Uh, I need to lie down~</p>
