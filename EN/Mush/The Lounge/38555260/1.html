                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4144">Link to the scoreboard</a></p><p>Eleesha here; this was a seriously turbulent ship. The crew was fairly passive and unexcited, and so looking for any signs of Mush fell entirely to me; a task I may have been overwhelmed by, because it resulted in the deaths of several innocents before we got a clear view of who the Mush might be.</p><p>The initial suspect, Roland, fell to the culling blade due to his erratic and strange behavior; he did a lot of strange newbie things while showing decent knowledge in other fields (such as knowing about the importance of trade ships and relaying). The crew agreed with me that it was suspicious, and so he was the first to fall... however he was just a <strong>human</strong> newbie. Sorry for killing you, Roland.</p><p>The second suspect was a result of two occurrences:</p><ul><li>The Research Console unexpectedly broke. Viewing the logs made apparent that it only could've been a <em>Green Jelly</em> hit by one of three characters: <em>Derek</em>, Hua and Ian.</li><li>When asked to surrender his bed to me (a <em>Gold</em> character with 3 wildly important skills to the crew), <em>Derek</em> (as Shooter/Wrestler) straight up refused.</li></ul><p>When my suspicion rose and I knifed him off the bed so that, if he was Mush, I could finish him faster later, he turned around to shoot me off the bed with his remaining Shooter point before the cycle changed. This prompted me to investigate his AP activity, of which I didn't notice much. Long story short, I collected all the evidence against him and presented it to the Mush hunt, who all agreed to kill him, and so he died just because he couldn't surrender a bed to a more important crew member.</p><p>After that, <em>Derek</em> was obviously eliminated as Green Jelly suspect, and <em>Hua</em> turned out to be too contributive to the crew to realistically be a Mush, as she constantly relayed researches, treated plants and shot down Hunters, keeping us alive. So, <em>Ian</em> was the only suspect left, which also aligned with the fact that he lying in bed all day and yet not doing <em>anything</em> whatsoever. As we were slowly making plans on how to kill him, <strong>Raluca</strong> snapped and went on a rampage in the Icarus Bay after an expo. Stephen and Paola eliminated her with some planning and good timing. And as we all went to sleep, <strong>Ian</strong> - as expected - went on a rampage and slew Frieda (who foolishly reported having 3 HP in a public thread) and, together with <strong>Jin Su</strong>, tried to kill Janice. I grabbed a <em>Spaced Potato</em> to slay them, and then all that was left was waiting for our inevitable demise, as we were being chased by dozens of Hunters, had barely any oxygen left, and didn't have the crew to sustain our journey any longer.</p><p>TL;DR: My Mush investigations led exclusively to innocent deaths, the Mush rampaged out of boredom, and barely anything ever got done on the ship except for comms and a couple NERON projects. It's a bit disappointing considering we've had a pretty good and active crew (props to Stephen, Jin Su, Kuan Ti, Paola and Frieda for making the ship lively), but I suppose it couldn't be avoided.</p><p>I apologize for my headstrong attitude, as I cannot help but take the reins in any game I play out of pure mistrust for other players' competence and activity. Sadly, the signs I took as evidence of mushiness were mostly evidence of ineptitude and un-efficient play. I have yet to learn how and when to rush for a kill, and when to wait for more evidence without risking a rampage. I also apologize for not role-playing Eleesha convincingly; I was going for a blaxploitation movie-kind of "groovy soul sista" character, but I didn't manage the role well enough to keep it up consistently. My cynical and cold character always manages to come out in the end. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Still, thank you for the journey! As short as it was, at least it was pretty interesting.</p>

                <p>It was mostly just bad luck for the human crew. There was almost zero evidence from the Mush, I know this because I was one of the alpha mush, I was <strong>Jin Su</strong>.</p><p><strong>Ian</strong> and I converted <strong>Raluca</strong> on day 2 before anyone was even paying enough attention. I had washed twice in the dorms and never stayed dirty for more than a minute, I also never picked up the soap so no one would ever know I had washed.</p><p><strong>Roland</strong> was unfortunate to make so many basic errors while understanding some of the more advanced game terms. Ian had told me you suspected him, so when you contacted me telling me you had the knife and were close to killing someone, I added my own suspicions about Roland. You killed him, which was fine, he'd have been a terrible beta mush.</p><p>As for poor <strong>Derek</strong>, that could probably been avoided by you, but, as a mush I had to take advantage of the situation and let you have the kill mission. I was tempted to give him the mission to kill you instead, he had sent me a message of protest about what you did, but, I figured you'd kill him before he killed you so you got the nod.</p><p>The rampage was a carefully planned and timed attack, but poor implemented. When <strong>Terrence</strong> died, that left you with about 4 people who were not confirmed human, everyone else had illnesses, so, we had to do something before <strong>Andie</strong> also died which would leave leave Ian, who had taken annonymush, as prime suspect. The expedition was undertaken to weaken some crew enough for quick kills. The hope was for Raluca to kill everyone in the Icarus bay, but she got bad rolls and only managed to kill KT. As you later learned <strong>Freida</strong> was badly hurt and I had thought she would mention my 3 swings I took at her in Icarus, seems no one noticed that at all.</p><p>I was out of everything, so I was going to wait until the next cycle and kill Frieda, thus saving Ian as you'd have your two mush, but he came back and we decided to try and kill everyone by morale loss. As you know, it failed, bad rolls again, but <strong>Chun</strong> did die from morale, so that worked in our favour, with her dead, there was nothing the remaining crew could do but wait to die.</p><p>All in all, you weren't a bad detective really, it's just I never gave you any evidence to find. In fact, if Terrence hadn't died, the plan was to infect other crew member as we had the spores almost ready, I just needed to make mine and wash up, then I'd get healed up since I was badly hurt from the expedition. Sadly, the game had to end before we could do that.</p>

                <p>Hello, everyone. I was <strong>Stephen.</strong> <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":tid_smile:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I was feeling lazy at the start of this ship. My goal was to just help when I was needed and blend in to the ship when I wasn't, not participating much in chat or matters which did not concern me. Of course, I should have taken the sacrificial banana as a sign of things to come.</p><p>During the first few days, I just did odd-jobs, slotting objects into their places and taking the apprentice skill for later use. (A skill the mush hunters believed was an odd choice for a bronze player considering the time involved without a gold bonus.) I brought plants and bananas to the lab and, in an attempt to drop one in the lab, I mis-clicked and ate a banana. I had to deflect facepalms from the entire crew over this grave dishonour. I picked up my activity after that and actually ended up accidentally playing a grumpy, argumentative Stephen; echoes of the banana debate. I built a sofa and went to stand around in Bravo Dorm.</p><p>Roland was a sprinter, so I thought it odd when he one day just got up and left the dorm for about 10 minutes. I asked what he was doing and he said he was checking to see if he could pilot a ship. A few things about him didn't add up, so Eleesha went ahead and stabbed him to death. He was no mush but he confirmed Eleesha and I as humans by giving us psychological diseases after his death.</p><p>That's when I was inducted into the Mushroominati, a private chat for interesting and "trustworthy" crew and the even deeper Confirmed Human Chat. I had never seen a mush-hunt layered in this way before and found it very interesting. After Derek and Eleesha fought over a bed, Eleesha knifed him and lay down. Derek shot her and left to hide behind Ian in Alpha Dorm. As a result, the Confirmed Human chat launched a shadow raid against him. I used my apprentice skill to copy Derek's wrestler skill and kicked Ian out of the room before we battered Derek to death. Another dead human. Eleesha and the humans were disappointed again.</p><p>Soon, we launched an expedition to an interesting planet but got many unfavourable results. (Did you take Traitor, Jin Su?) Then Raluca rushes into Icarus Bay, throws a grenade then beats Kuan Ti to death. Like Derek, she ran to hide behind Ian, who I had to kick out again. With Ian gone, we finished Raluca. I went inactive for a few cycles and Eleesha's kill crew finished the remaining mush over night but the ship was doomed with a lack of pilots and no astrophysicists. We called it quits but I managed to solve the MadKube before we exploded. Janice joked that I should eat a banana as a reward.</p><p>Nice game, everybody. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":tid_happy:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>In retrospect, Roland's and Derek's deaths weren't actually <em>that</em> fruitless because A) less suspects meant less noise in the detective work and B) the resulting illnesses confirmed several characters as human, which created priceless allies in the Mush hunt. So I think I was being rather short-sighted; considering that I didn't feel like the ship was a drag at any point during the game - like I often do with other ships - this was actually a pretty good round! Also, sweetness in shortness.</p><p>Regarding Jin Su I gotta mention that you <em>do</em> always leave evidence in form of lack of activity. Even with you I <em>did</em> notice that you barely spent your AP on anything, and it was pretty suspicious. However, as so often, your eloquence and (comparative) talkativeness distracted me, so that I focused on the more quiet members of the crew instead. I should've seen it coming... Jin Su was a major Mush on my previous ship, after all. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Also yeah, I'd like to know how the Mush acted, which skills they used etc. Was PILGRED trapped to catch Raluca, or...? I was hoping to catch someone red-handed by secretly deploying MycoAlarms everywhere, but it seems that was pointless. I even brought a MycoAlarm to Raluca into Alpha Dorm when I suspected her transfering out before dying, but that seemed to have no effect either.</p>

                <p>Stephen, yes I did have traitor, I almost died for it but the hope was to wound the team enough for Raluca to finish everyone off and to make the trip utterly pointless. Raluca didn't pick any skills till she had to fight, then it was hard boiled. Ian had green slime, annonymush and left two slots open for end game, I never did ask what he chose.</p><p>Raluca was turned by deception and timing, I had spiked her once in rear corridor as she was going to or from nexus the day mush were chosen. The next time, both me and Ian spiked her one after the other, within seconds of each other. Again, items being moved around was how we did it. I asked her in a private message to bring up the gloves or something that were in engineering still, and Ian's reason for being in rear corridor at the same time was to pick up and deliver Chun's armour. If the timing hadn't worked out, he'd have relayed Pilgred.</p><p>The research station was slimmed by Ian, unlucky for Derek, and Gioele, but it stopped research progress for a good while.</p><p>As for you seeing me come and go without doing anything, yeah, it's in the logs, but I could shower without anyone seeing simply by not picking up the soap, it's a rookie mistake people make all the time. If you had said anything at the time, my excuse was the Roland knife thing, was checking to see if he had dropped it.</p><p>We did plan on converting more people, but sadly too many deaths meant we had no time. We would have maybe grabbed KT as he relayed Pilgred, then used him and Raluca to rush it with the help of missions. I know you were checking progress, but I had figured we could get it done if enough worked at the same time.</p><p>I really wish Ian had showered when I mentioned it to him, but he figured he would stay dirty till people noticed. If he had just been clean me and Raluca could have did the rampage, died, he'd have lived to the end and been a hero.</p>

The crew was fairly passive and unexcited, and so looking for any signs of Mush fell entirely to me; a task I may have been overwhelmed by, because it resulted in the deaths of several innocents before we got a clear view of who the Mush might be.</p><p>The initial suspect, Roland, fell to the culling blade due to his erratic and strange behavior; he did a lot of strange newbie things while showing decent knowledge in other fields (such as knowing about the importance of trade ships and relaying). The crew agreed with me that it was suspicious, and so he was the first to fall... however he was just a <strong>human</strong> newbie. Sorry for killing you, Roland.</p><p>The second suspect was a result of two occurrences:</p><br><ul><li>The Research Console unexpectedly broke. Viewing the logs made apparent that it only could've been a <em>Green Jelly</em> hit by one of three characters: <em>Derek</em>, Hua and Ian.</li><li>When asked to surrender his bed to me (a <em>Gold</em> character with 3 wildly important skills to the crew), <em>Derek</em> (as Shooter/Wrestler) straight up refused.When my suspicion rose and I knifed him off the bed so that, if he was Mush, I could finish him faster later, he turned around to shoot me off the bed with his remaining Shooter point before the cycle changed. This prompted me to investigate his AP activity, of which I didn't notice much. Long story short, I collected all the evidence against him and presented it to the Mush hunt, who all agreed to kill him, and so he died just because he couldn't surrender a bed to a more important crew member.</li></ul><p>After that, <em>Derek</em> was obviously eliminated as Green Jelly suspect, and <em>Hua</em> turned out to be too contributive to the crew to realistically be a Mush, as she constantly relayed researches, treated plants and shot down Hunters, keeping us alive. So, <em>Ian</em> was the only suspect left, which also aligned with the fact that he lying in bed all day and yet not doing <em>anything</em> whatsoever. As we were slowly making plans on how to kill him, <strong>Raluca</strong> snapped and went on a rampage in the Icarus Bay after an expo. Stephen and Paola eliminated her with some planning and good timing. And as we all went to sleep, <strong>Ian</strong> - as expected - went on a rampage and slew Frieda (who foolishly reported having 3 HP in a public thread) and, together with <strong>Jin Su</strong>, tried to kill Janice. I grabbed a <em>Spaced Potato</em> to slay them, and then all that was left was waiting for our inevitable demise, as we were being chased by dozens of Hunters, had barely any oxygen left, and didn't have the crew to sustain our journey any longer.</p><p>TL;DR: My Mush investigations led exclusively to innocent deaths, the Mush rampaged out of boredom, and barely anything ever got done on the ship except for comms and a couple NERON projects. It's a bit disappointing considering we've had a pretty good and active crew (props to Stephen, Jin Su, Kuan Ti, Paola and Frieda for making the ship lively), but I suppose it couldn't be avoided.</p><p>I apologize for my headstrong attitude, as I cannot help but take the reins in any game I play out of pure mistrust for other players' competence and activity. Sadly, the signs I took as evidence of mushiness were mostly evidence of ineptitude and un-efficient play. I have yet to learn how and when to rush for a kill, and when to wait for more evidence without risking a rampage. I also apologize for not role-playing Eleesha convincingly; I was going for a blaxploitation movie-kind of "groovy soul sista" character, but I didn't manage the role well enough to keep it up consistently. My cynical and cold character always manages to come out in the end. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Still, thank you for the journey! As short as it was, at least it was pretty interesting.</p></cite><p>The biggest asset mush can have are humans who act really dumb. In my last game before my current one, I knew that our Terrence was a mush, but then our Stephen was like LOL imma cook and started cooking all of our food, and by the time we had the AP to kill Terrence too, we were already boned because of inactives and no food.</p>
