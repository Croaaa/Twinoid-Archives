And what a lovely weather we have here on Eden today.... and what a lovely crew we had! And what a lovely woman I've... uh, I'm spacing out again! Sorry! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Okay, where to begin? One thing I definitely need to highlight is how our ship had <em>no inactives</em>! Not everyone could be active for the whole duration of the journey, but we can still consider ourselves to be very lucky just for that reason alone. When it came to starmaps and scanning, we were not quite as lucky... But here I am talking about the end again when I should start with the beginning!</p><p>So, one more try... the <em>mush hunt</em>! Yes, let's start here. <br>It all began with the sample being nowhere to be found. And even to this day, we still have no idea where it is and who hid it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico">... kind of a rough start, but at least this gave us some traces to work with. Chun, Gioele and I discussed various suspects and in the end, we decided to kill <strong>Andie</strong> for running around a lot whilst not actually doing anything pro-human at all. First mush down.<br>At the same time, Paola rushed the xyloph DBs to find the ghost sample – with success. Mush hunt later turned out be over before we could actually finish any anti-mush-research, but I'd imagine that this was still a nice counter which put quite some pressure upon our second mush: <strong>Derek</strong>. In fact, it was so much pressure that he... showered himself to death? <br>I don't know. Derek was a funny fellow, did some hilarious RPing before dying. I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt and say that it was not what he intended to do. Maybe he really overlooked a roomshake or something. Anyway, second mush down.</p><p>This quick and clean mush hunt put us (14 active people!) into a wonderful position. After some organisational work, we ended up with <em>four pilots, three techs, three shrinks and three astrophysicists</em>. One of the astrophysicists also happened to be a caffeine junkie. Oh, and we also had ten hydropots. And a diplomat. And a babel module. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Still, even with all these things we had going for us, finding the starmaps turned out to be very difficult. So... it was not one of these ships which achieved something against all odds, but... mh, how to put it? The odds were on our side, but RNG tested us again and again until it finally gave us what we desired. I think this is most true with Gioele, who – despite being having the astro+caffeine combo – did not found a single worthwhile planet until day 16! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"><br>Also goes to show that, having all these helpful skills and stuff is nice, but cooperation and patience is what counts in the end. We had to prove that we had both before getting rewarded. <br>Well, thanks everyone! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Also did some fun roleplaying. Unfortunately, she went inactive all of sudden and never came back. Very sad, not only because she was our last hope and medic... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> Well, I am pretty sure that she had a good reason, so she still gets a thumbs-up from me for her performance in the early days.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/frieda_bergmann.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FB:" class="tid_ico">Frieda: Similar to Chun, Frieda was very active in the first half of the ship and then had to go inactive. Unlike Chun, Frieda informed us about this and gave us an estimated time of return. But sadly, we failed to keep her alive during her absence... Sorry! Really would have liked to take you with us to Eden. :[</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/lai_kuan_ti.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_LKT:" class="tid_ico">Kuan Ti: One of our less talkative crewmembers. Kuan Ti helped out in a lot of areas and also took part in some expos, but his silence became a problem when we hit D10 and communication became more and more important. He was still as helpful as ever, but he failed to ask for help and thus died... Kuan Ti, don't be afraid of speaking up more often. It really won't kill you... if anything, it is the opposite. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/paola_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_PR:" class="tid_ico">Paola: Being only a botanist, Paola was probably the one with the oddest skill choice. Nevertheless, she did some fantastic work at the comms center followed by some fantastic work in the lab. And after that... she kind of fell silent. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> I am assuming that she did not know what do anymore, and if that's the case then we are partly to blame for giving her not enough instructions. Sorry Paola.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/roland_zuccali.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RZ:" class="tid_ico">Roland: Talented pilot, but very busy irl. At times he was offline for days, and when he did play, he did so without saying much. At one point we were pretty close to selling him for fuel because we did not think he would come back. In the end, he died from depression during one of his inactive periods.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/stephen_seagull.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_SS:" class="tid_ico">Stephen: Here we have Roland's biggest fan! He copied his pilot and shooter skill and did everything he could in order to become more like his idol. Unfortunately, this did also mean that he was just as silent. Still, I appreciate his work. Roland and Stephen were sort of like our ship's dark knights. Looking at the number of hunters we shot down... they seem to have done a pretty good job. It would have been okay to brag! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/raluca_tomescu.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RT:" class="tid_ico">Raluca: Started the game by declaring that she was not mush and had no interest to play. Still not sure if that was some sort of next-level roleplaying or if she just changed her mind, but... well, luckily for us, Raluca did play eventually and became a big help. She was still a bit weird and claimed our bottle opener all for herself, but I guess that's just Raluca being Raluca. Also... her actions started a sort of rivalry between her and Terrence. At least to me it looked this way, and it was hilarious. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/terrence_archer.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_TA:" class="tid_ico">Terrence: As enthusiastic about drones as it gets! Terrence was a fun person to be with, and although he was not the most experienced or anything like that, I still really enjoyed having him on board. My favorite Terrence moment™ was when he asked where all the drones were... at a point where he himself had not build any drones yet. He thought we would start with two or three drones. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> Was great to have an optimistic and non-grumpy Terrence for a change.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/eleesha_williams.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_EW:" class="tid_ico">Eleesha: Being only a tracker, Eleesha was jobless very early on. We let her have one shrink magebook, but she still had not much to do because morale was no problem for a long time. This caused Eleesha to become a bit silent during the middle of our voyage... but eventually, there was more than enough stuff for everyone to do, and Eleesha became more active and then tried to help where she could. Attending expos, healing people, loading fuel, asking where help was needed. Really liked your performance there Eleesha! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/gioele_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_GR:" class="tid_ico">Gioele: With his skills, he should have been the most successful scanner of them all.... and yet, he did not find anything good until the very last day! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> Other people might have given up on scanning at this point, but Gioele kept going and eventually found us our last starmap. Thanks! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Though scanning was not all Gioele did, he helped out with a ton of other stuff as well. He was also one of the crewmembers who got more and more active as time went on.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/ian_soulton.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_IS:" class="tid_ico">Ian: Lab work, planet scans, healing – Ian always seemed to know what was the best thing to do at any given time and always gave it his best. Also took care of all our plants and organized the hydropot distribution to keep them safe from any fires. And... he always left the medlab when I asked him to in order to... uhm.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"> Anyway, I really appreciate all you did, Ian!</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/jiang_hua.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JH:" class="tid_ico">Hua: Always active, always had good advice. I really felt like I could count on Hua, no matter what would happen. This (and her skillset) also made her my go to person for the missions... I think she received like ten out of 13 missions. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> Eventually, I ran out of things to say to her and just sent her random smileys. (*•̀ᴗ•́*)و ̑̑ ◝( ′ㅂ`)و ̑̑ <br>Surprised me that this is her first Eden ship. Well, it was about time, wasn't it? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/janice_kent.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JK:" class="tid_ico">Janice: My favorite crewmember! What happened between us should probably stay a secret <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"> ...but, uh, Janice did a lot of good stuff! Attended every expo, haggled with all these aliens to get us one of our starmaps, was very active and always caring for her comrades. I think I was not the only one who took a liking to her. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Your most busy but sadly most unlucky Astrophysisct is speaking here. I was Gioele and it really was a very fun ship. We where blessed with a sucessfull mush hunt and a very, very active Crew. Very many good factors came together on this ship but as already mentioned, it was our great Teamwork wich ultimately brought us towards Eden. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I admit that I was not that active and motivated at the beginning for whatever reason but as the days passed on I became more active as the ship started becoming better and better. It was just awesome to get 5 AP each cycle thanks to my beloved coffee machine and sink them into everything that could help us ( mostly scanning but sometimes repairing or healing as well).</p><p>I thought of that last planet as basicly my last shot (or the one before that) and got <strong>very</strong> lucky. Looks like I do know now where all my luck was hiding. Better late then never.</p>

                <p>Roland here, sorry for the once a day play. Work and busy weekends with family often limit my playability so I try to stick to characters that can handle once a day dump AP and leave. I got hit with Chun dying, day change, and a panic attack all at the same time, and logged in 20 minutes into the cycle in which I died, so that was rough. You all were a great team and I'm really glad you all made it to Eden!</p>
