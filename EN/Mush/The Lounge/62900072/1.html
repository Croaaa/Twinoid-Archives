She gone to live a long life and leave behind a great legacy which just was filled with masterpieces that only a genius could create.</span></span></p><p>This ship : <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/13153" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/13153</a> Eden D15C3</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> Here. So this ship started out really promising, a very active crew in each part, yet our piloting team were really strong. We started out really great with planets and many other things, and we got lucky as well. We started out without any mush in D5C2 which was kinda funny and great. We knew the only option would be, Eden. So crew started working together and man it was fun. We got all starmaps by D11~D12 and decided to go for D15 landmark. Tho not all of the crew agreed to that but we made it with some losses.</p><br><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/jinsu.png" alt=":mush_jin_su_50:" class="tid_ico"> Jin you were actually a great commander, putting a great amount of your time and attention on things that really matter. I always love to have a commander with such discipline! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> It was really great to travel with you.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico"> Andie I am really sorry that you didn't made it to Eden, I am really serious about this one. Wished you was there before panic attack so I could get you to live for another day to see Eden together, you was actually a really great teammate that helped ton in expeditions.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/roland.png" alt=":mush_roland_50:" class="tid_ico"> Roland you were actually one of greatest pilots I ever seen! Tbh when I choose Raluca I just prayed I would atleast get one active pilot that just talk, and damn boi you talked XD It was a really great experience to have you on the board sir! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"> Ian, I loved playing with you but man if you could put a little more time into the game we could have a wonderful garden! Tho you done your job as the Ian so am not complaining XD I wish to play with you again someday <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> Janice why the hell you wouldn't speak at all XD I mean you couldn't speak english or something? Or was just busy irl? Like you would get on and hug everyone and then leave. We didn't know nothing about your HP and you were starving too :/ I just hoped you could talk more</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/paola.png" alt=":mush_paola_50:" class="tid_ico"> I love you girl! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Being Paola this days is hard with slow filling crew but you did well in whatever part you could have helped!

Like when we decided to go for D15 you argued hardly against it, crew could see your point but we ALL decided to move on. So you just had to survive in any form possible. Like dude myself gone to 2 HP and brought myself back WITHOUT having a bed and alot of APs. Tho your death kinda was due to Andie wasting a ton of AP on kube XD So yeah . . . . I wish you luck on the next ships but man you could survive :/</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hua.png" alt=":mush_hua_50:" class="tid_ico"> Talk more girl . . . . you hardly said anything on the trip XD But atleast you got the job done so am greatful for that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>:mush_eleesha_50: You really wanted to go for longer days but for that you need some active healer and a willing crew, from end of D13 I could feel the crew was losing its activity so thats why I said we should get back, and just at the end of D14 we lost two teammate so yeah, I didn't meant to be rude but lets say I had better ships that were struggling worse in D15 XD</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/derek.png" alt=":mush_derek_50:" class="tid_ico"> I am really sad about you Derek, you were active and a great person! Tho died virgin you left behind some great drones to help us! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I wish to play with you again someday</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"> Am not sure if you were new to the game or whatever but you were active and learned quick so I can say really good job Chun! It was really good to have you on board. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>And THATS IT!

                <p>My apologies for talking so much <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">. It's been my experience that a quiet crew is a dead crew, but of course we were mush free so we would've been fine. I'm very happy to have made it to Eden.</p><p><strong>Raluca</strong> truly did a great job managing her AP after Janice's untimely death. I appreciate your efforts in keeping the ship alive post-eden.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> was a fantastic commander. I'm used to playing Jin Su so I tried to be less commanding and let Jin Su talk... pretty sure I failed in that regards.</p><p><strong>Derek</strong>... I truly think if we didn't lose you, we wouldn't have lost anyone else. You were always doing the right things at the right times.</p><p><strong>Frieda</strong> was a bit of a cynic. Can't say it was unwarranted, I'm sorry we couldn't keep you alive. Without her, we wouldn't have made it.</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> was a great backup astro. Sorry I didn't believe you when you said you were human, eh?</p><p><strong>Andie</strong>, never give up on a ship. Always communicate. I had your back there.</p><p><strong>Chun</strong>, doubt you're gonna read this but you did really well for being newer to the game, <strong>Ian</strong> you too.</p><p><strong>Paola</strong>, of course, was very interested in having kids... never gonna forget that one day when she invited all the men to a private channel to have a kid <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It's been a good 50 or so voyages since I got to Eden, I'm happy I made it with this crew. We had enough people to run expeditions, provide knowledge to newer players, and keep people alive until it got boring. What a great way to end playing Mush (for the time being, anyways). Till we meet again.</p>

                <p>Hello, crew! Your commander is speaking. I had a lot of fun. This was actually my first time playing Jin Su so at times I was a bit insecure about what it entails exactly to be the commander. There's definitely more to it than just moving the ship. You don't have to be a dictator but there are times when the commander needs to take charge for the ship to move in the right direction (sorry, bad pun).</p><p>We had a really active crew. Even the people that didn't talk much or at all did their job really well. We also had a few newbies who are really eager to learn.</p><p><strong>Raluca</strong> Repaired PILGRED granting us infinite (well, 8 per day, really) coffee and built the plasma shield. Without you the ship would probably have fallen apart on the later days. You always knew what to do. I also loved your no-bullshit attitude on chat. Really fitting for Raluca.</p><p><strong>Roland</strong> I'm not sure you ever sleep. It felt like you were always active doing stuff and keeping an eye on everything. I also greatly appreciated your advice. If I was a good commander, then part of that was definitely due to you pushing me in the right direction. Also congratulations on your place in the Top 10!</p><p><strong>Andie</strong> Our master diplomat. Eden would have been impossible without you because some aliens would have mauled us to death before we would have found that third star map. I'm sorry that you didn't make it there with us.</p><p><strong>Derek</strong> Without your drones we would have been done for. Your death came as a real shock to me. One minute I was joking about how the others should find you, the next you were dead. I also loved you on chat. Always roleplaying a bit and joking around but when the situation demanded it you knew what to do.</p><p><strong>Chun</strong> You were active and willing to learn. You weren't shy at all and talked quite a bit. That's what I want to see in new people. I hope you'll stick around because this game really needs fresh blood.</p><p><strong>Frieda</strong> Our onboard cynic. Always telling us that we shouldn't go to those Intelligent Life planets and focus on cristalite. We proved you wrong with that last fragment, I guess, but I still greatly appreciate the counter-balance you were to everyone else's enthusiasm.</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> When we finished PILGRED, I thought, "Damn, now Eleesha will hack the command console and jump back to Sol". I'm glad you turned out to be human. You were also really active in keeping the ship running and you always brought good ideas to the table. It was your idea to give the Sprinter book to me which saved me soooo much AP.</p><p><strong>Janice</strong> You were so quiet. It honestly was a bit surreal how you almost never talked but then I would suddenly see a "Janice comforted you" in the logs. But you still did your job really well so I hope to see you again and maybe next time you'll talk more.</p><p><strong>Hua</strong> Kind of the same deal as with Janice. I thought until like D10 that you were inactive. Fortunately, you proved me wrong there.</p><p><strong>Ian</strong> Thank you for all the fruit, though one of them gave me food poisoning. I guess that's my own fault to a degree for eating spoiled fruit but still...</p><p><strong>Paola</strong> Another person who was really willing to learn and ended up doing a lot for the ship despite being new. Did your "mating strategy" work out in the end, by the way?</p><p>And let's not forget the one and only <strong>Kuan Ti</strong>. Without your selfless sacrifice this ship wouldn't have made it this far. Those two hydropots produced some tasty bananas.</p><p>Again, I thank all of you for this great ship. This was a ship of many firsts for me. It's a bit sad that we couldn't go on even longer but you could also feel the motivation dropping during the last few days. I'm still really happy with what we achieved. I hope to see all of you again on future ships!</p><p>Signing off,<br>Jin Su</p>

However, you extracted in medlab in front of your Mush partner, Gioele and were suspicious in other ways too.

OK, it may take at least a few months... But it'll take only a few minutes out of your day. Silly games, such as a pac-man variant, and something akin to minesweeper.... and more..</p>
