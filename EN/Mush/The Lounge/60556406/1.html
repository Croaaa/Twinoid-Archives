Mush hunt was super effective with Stephen killed and Eleesha vaccinated, and very few people died on that ship. We never really had a shot at Eden due to our lack of luck in scanning and few expeditions, but it was still really fun playing with you guys, and we made all the way to day 15 (though I still think we should've tried day 20 you pessimists <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>Derek I was really surprised by your sudden change in the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/surprised.png" alt=":sq_surprised:" class="tid_ico"> You didn't throw me out into space and you even called me your <strong>brother</strong>! You know what? I like you too!</p><p>Terrence you take well care of Eleesha and her baby, I hope we'll be able to organise you a proper wedding. You guys deserve that.</p><p>Ian, well... I guess you're disappointed me and Derek are just friends <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> Don't be sad, it was never meant to be. I'll help you create a new garden on Sol.</p><p>And thanks to all the others too <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":sq_happy:" class="tid_ico"> really loved you guys</p>

                <p>Hi, Roland, Ian here! This was the coolest ship I've ever been on <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Even though mush hunt might have looked effective, for me it was rather exhausting, as mush seemed to do nothing, which contributed to my paranoia. If it was not for Derek's cool-headedness (and my stupid pacifist trait <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) I would've certainly killed a couple of innocents by day 10. I'd love to hear Eleesha's story by the way, did she have a plan at all?</p><p>I agree that we could've tried to wait till D20 but I was worried people would start dying unexpectedly. I grew so fond of our crew that I couldn't let anyone die I guess! Apologies if I misjudged the situation <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Thank you guys for the fun stuff, RPing and all! It was a great pleasure to meet you and I hope I'll see you soon</p>

                <p>Derek here. Roland was just so easy to pick on in the beginning after jokingly saying he was mush. At that point I just kept rolling with the punches and took jabs at him every chance I got. Towards the end, Derek started feeling toward Roland like a big brother would feel toward a little brother. I could say whatever I want, and do whatever I want, but if anyone else threatens him, they'll have to answer to me.</p><p>I can't say I can blame Eleesha for the way she played. Mush Stephen was inactive and this was a very active ship. I wouldn't have taken much to identify and kill her. As it stands, it took until day 11 or 12 before we finally figured out who it was and even then it was just an educated guess. The secret mush hunting channel was very underwhelming to say the least.</p><p>I feel like we could have stretched another few days, but unless we had a stupid good streak of luck we never would have made it to Eden. Maybe if we could have traded useless Roland for an active Janice to keep up morale easier as well as take advantage of haing a diplomat, it might have been better. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":tid_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I had hopped right into a new ship as Paola and there is very little activity and I am sad.</p>
