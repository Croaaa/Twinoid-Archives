                <p>Welcome to the Ship of Super Mush Transfer Murderfest!</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8057" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8057</a></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/roland_zuccali.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RZ:" class="tid_ico"> Roland here! To start off this random jump ship, I decided to try my hand at a new character. On my last random jump ship, I played as Finola with no one to relay me in research so I was bursting at the seams with AP. Our Paola got a Pilot Mage Book so I was given the go ahead by Chun to read it and take down the Hunters before our hull was demolished. Needless to say, I kind of liked this piloting business and I wanted to try a character with that specific role. I was hoping for Hua but when Roland showed up, I snagged him. I was the fourth to wake up (with a broken finger no less) so I did my own surgery then laid down in Alpha Dorm. The others on board at the same time had already taken inventory of the ship’s items so I didn’t worry about moving stuff around and thought I would save my AP for hunters.</p><p>Some time passes and finally the ship fills around Day 2. When I log in, I’m greeted with the giant “Welcome to the Mush!” message. Nooo! Not again! The last time I was Alpha Mush, I was playing Janice for the first time. <em>Hrmph.</em> Fine then. I just have to play the hand I’m dealt. I opened a PM with my Alpha Partner, Stephen, right away, keeping the Mush Channel clear in case something went horribly wrong. It would be just my luck. Anyways, Stephen told me that he was a Bronze player and level 6. I was Gold and level 10. We could make this work. Right away, he took Trapper and pulled two spores, covering the Nexus and Rear Corridor shelving unit. Janice picked up the one in the Nexus, relaying projects, and Terrence got the one in Rear Corridor while picking up the Anti-Grav Scooter. Stephen managed to trap the RC shelf one last time before MycoAlarms were finished and caught Raluca when she picked up the wrench.</p><p>Research was going fairly slowly. I was able to distract the research team with the Lenses, since only Anti-Spore Gas had been completed so far. It wasn’t until Day 4 or 5 that Constipaspore Serum was finished. I don’t really remember. It was just oddly late. Anyways, I try a risky move. I gathered up two spores over the past couple of days with “legitimate” excuses for being dirty and moved to Alpha Bay 2 because since I’m a pilot, it doesn’t seem super suspicious that I’m in there, buuuuut...just before day change? I was pretty nervous. I popped into Rear Alpha Turret to say hello to Raluca and infected her once on Cycle 8 and once again on Cycle 1 (I think it was Day 6). I Defaced the room then left, heading to Central Alpha Storage where the oxygen tank broke. I reported it then peaked at the shelf for fun. I couldn’t believe it. A Shrink Mage Book? All by its lonesome? I checked the logs to see who else was in the room. Raluca. <em>Shoot.</em> Had she told anyone? I really want to hide it but I’ll look incredibly suspicious if it’s gone and I was the last one in the room and Raluca notified Chun. So I left it alone, suddenly remembered to take Anonymush, then went back to bed. I was hoping that Raluca would go fix the oxygen tank and hide the book herself after she revealed that she told no one but Terrence beat her to it and he brought the book to Alpha Dorm. <em>Crap.</em> I sure hope no one reads it…</p><p>The next plan of action was to convert Terrence under Defacer then I would pick up the Shrink Mage Book, read it, then go on to Transfer into Janice, thereby destroying the humans hope for long term morale. But Stephen couldn’t be online at the suggested time so we waited. Some cycles later, when I was asleep IRL, Jin Su, Hua, and Gioele went off on an expedition. I happened to glance at the crew bar and noticed there were two extra dead crew members. I read NERON’s announcements and found that it was Jin Su and Hua that died. <em>What luck!</em> When Gioele posted the link to the expedition, I saw that they had a team strength of <strong>two</strong> and they hit <strong>three</strong> fight zones. I was now the last pilot. I wouldn’t be surprised if I was suspected, but the crew didn’t have much choice unless they wanted to smash the hull to bits letting non-pilots shoot down hunters. And I was...fairly helpful. Some of the time.</p><p>Now we really needed Terrence on the Mush Team. We would have both Techs and the last Pilot. But Paola could still trade for PILGRED and Janice could still keep up everyone’s morale (granted she was inactive on and off for extended periods of time). The Shrink Mage Book would have been really useful to except...there was a fire. In Alpha Dorm. And the book was destroyed. <em>The RNGods have smiled upon us again!</em> That’s one less loose end to worry about.</p><p>So now it’s Day 7 and Stephen and I are ready to convert Terrence. I Deface Alpha Dorm and infect then Stephen goes in for the second infect (I sent Stephen some Gold Days so that he could take Anonymush as well and keep the humans in the dark a little while longer). I can see that there’s 12 hunters outside right now but I have important Mush things to do instead. We start to discuss our next plan of action. We came up with a <strong>Super Mush Transfer Murderfest.</strong> There were some bumps in the road, such as I originally planned to Transfer into Finola because I have her at level 4 and I could call a Ceasefire to protect the Mush if things went awry. But I had already infected Terrence for Day 7 and I couldn’t infect again. We had already decided that Stephen would Transfer into Janice (since he also infected already that day but Janice had been carrying a spore since just about the beginning of the ship). Raluca had been carrying a spore on her for a few days and would use it to infect Ian and Transfer into him, keeping him from protecting the humans with his Pacifism. Lastly Terrence was to Transfer into Gioele and keep a hold of the Commander title. I was the back-up in case any of the humans failed to die properly. As luck would have it yet again, all four of us had full AP on Cycle 8 when we began the Murderfest.</p><p>Stephen went first. He went into the Refectory and cooked all the rations he could with his free points (in case the humans survived), then went to Bravo Dorm, Transferred to Janice, went to the Nexus and turned off <strong>death announcements</strong> and turned back on <strong>food destruction</strong> as well as <strong>Peace Core</strong> (I don’t know why our Janice turned it off initially, just to have fun I suppose but we didn’t want the humans throwing grenades at us so on it went). Then Stephen-now-Janice whacked off Kuan Ti idling in the Nexus then went to Bravo Dorm, made sure his old body was dead and helped kill Chun with Terrence’s help. Terrence Transferred to Gioele as planned, killed off his old body, and went to the Bridge to help kill off Frieda and Paola. While this is going down, Raluca heads up to the Lab and Transfers into Ian, mutates, then kills off her old body before going to the Bridge as well. <strong>NOTE:</strong> I should probably say, the order of events might not be entirely accurate. All I really have to go off of is what our “plan” was and watching a couple death announcements and dots disappear while waiting in Alpha Dorm.</p><p>All that’s left is Finola and the glorious Mushes are out of AP. Except for me. I picked up a blaster during Defacer while converting Terrence, dropped my iTrackie (since we had Brainsync, I didn’t need it and poor, unsuspecting Finola had been offline all day so I was fairly certain she wouldn’t move), I picked up the Lenses from Alpha Bay, and made my way to the Medlab. Within a couple minutes, the ship was entirely human-free. The Mush celebrated their victory on the Bridge. I went back to convert Schrodinger just for kicks and giggles. Then three hours later, the Mush were finally assassinated by NERON.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/stephen_seagull.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_SS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Stephen:</strong> My Alpha Mush Partner in crime. You were wonderful! I think your Trappings really turned the tide for late game play! Even though our schedules were pretty opposite, we made it work!</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/raluca_tomescu.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RT:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Raluca:</strong> My first Beta (in Mush <em>ever</em>). I was so terrified that I would get caught while converting you. You were a fantastic addition to the Mush! Thanks for being such a good sport and a huge help!</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/terrence_archer.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_TA:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Terrence:</strong> The Endgame Beta. You were the last piece of the puzzle. With the four of us, we became an unstoppable force! How did it feel to learn that you were sleeping next to two Mushes for so long?</p><p>As for the rest of the humans, I really didn’t interact with you much. At first I tried to pass some suspicion onto Hua but that was no longer necessary when she died on the expedition. I think the Mush were extremely lucky that our Eleesha and Chao were dead (Chao starved and Eleesha was Quarantined), so no List, no possible Torturing, and especially no Tracking. I never would have made it out of Raluca’s turret alive if Eleesha was still around. Even with Defacer. Haha. And honestly, some of the humans were acting pretty Mushy, and that’s saying something coming from the actual Mush.</p><p>All in all, we caught a lot of lucky breaks on this ship. I’m absolutely giddy that the destruction of this ship went so well. I do have some screenshots of the Murderfest hilarity that I can post later when I edit them.</p>

I'm glad we acted when we did and ended on a high note. At least, for the Mush.</p>
