                <p>I want to thank everyone for a fun game first. And apologise for both the sol return and my english. I'm not a native speaker so the following text might hurt. doesn't help i wrote it right after the game and my adrenaline is sky high.</p><p>First time Jin Su, bored of inactive Jins so i solved it that way.</p><p>Our inactives where Finola who had the apron, Ian who was in Central corridor and Stephen who only got out of cryo.</p><p>The game started well, hunters getting killed, me collecting scraps. Paola being angry i created the sniper rifle and me making up with a sofa build for her.</p><p>I hid the hacker kit in icarus bay after mush selection since Chun hadn't talked yet.</p><p>The game got epic thanks to Schrodinger, who was more talkative then Raluca, and ordered us around.</p><p>Eleesha took the sniper and Hua read the radio expert book both getting 1 warning point. Since there was no apron (we were giving finola some time since she did research before going to the dorms) she got dirty from taking care of the plants.</p><p>Kuan Ti managed to get himself caught sporing on day 2 and was promptly killed, but Chao bruised his shoulder and lost his tongue (That might have been Schrodinger though <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">). Combined with the breaking of the lab terminal and healing Chao (No medic), we lost so much time Finola got kille dby Gio on day 4 and ASG was finished on day 5. 20 spores and it seems everyone was still human. i was sure there were Anonymush but it seems we managed to keep the spores split between us all.</p><p>Now i was actually really suspicious of Hua, getting dirty even with the apron back andnot sure what she did with all her ap but our first expo resulted in the following three things.</p><p>lots of fruit Hua promptly ate. 3 of them. so she was human. Eleesha was verified human by illness as well and in midway we finished Pilgred. i was scared the kit got found but nope, we just seemed to be very confused.</p><p>Eleesha screamed for ralucas blood but no one agreed. (specially since eleesha relayed pilgred with raluca before finishing. she also shot never there Chun for a bedspot and me for reading Chaos post its <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">). She managed to kill Raluca against what the crew said (and the missing medikit wasn't helping)</p><p>Chao now attempted to kill Hua for eating all the pills, He was kinda new to the game i think, not knowing wrestler doesn't work with the knife and all that. Luckly chao did listen to others (unlike eleesha who shot people a day with the lizaro. not having anyone able to heal didn't help)</p><p>This really only left Gioele and Terrence as possible mush (Roland, Paola and Frieda could have been but they would have been near perfect Humans) and with gio doing heavy research, Terrence was my main suspect but my mistakes with Hua made me too carefull.</p><p>And that got us to today. I had managed to catch my 3rd spore from either engine room or icarus bay, cause i moved the camera and then waited for our next expo. made sure i had 0ap and mp cause i suspected a transfer at any moment for the past 2 days so when Terrence turned me after cycle change i had 1ap/1mp and was all the way in icarus bay. i calculated it a few times and if i phagyocyted, i could take us to sol next cycle. but after killing Terrence they decided to rush the serum to cure the alpha mush (somehow assuming Terrence was a beta mush that got turned?) it was left at 85% with 1.5hours till cycle change. but then no one continued. cycle changed, i phagyocyted and took us to sol.</p><p>If contastispore had been finished, or if people realised that terrence taking down the camera in icarus bay, with only me and Janice and Terrence claiming Janice did it, and Janice killing Terrence, why not realise Terrence was alpha and had turned me? Unfortunate. Human JinSu was routing for you, hoping his plans, his warnings how high a target he was for transfer, would have made the headstart important.</p><br><p>Alas. Loved this ship <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/kim_jin_su.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_KJS:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hi, Terry here!</p><p>The game started out promising for both humans and mush, unfortunately Kuan refused to talk at all, and just went on a rampage.</p><p>That left me all alone, not being able to spike anyone because everyone was careful to stay under cameras, so all I did was trap shelves all day long.<br>I nearly went on a rampage a few days in, but then I caught a lucky break when all 4 expedition members got spored from a Chrysalite sector.</p><p>Humans in the end had something like 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1 spores on them. The mushvore bacteria really helped the humans out.<br>Since I didn't have Transfer (I had stupidly filled my skill slots), and couldn't see the hacker kit anywhere, all I could hope for was to turn Jin. In the end it was the Babel Module that I had intentionally left in Rear Corridor for you Jin that brought you up to 3 spores <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
