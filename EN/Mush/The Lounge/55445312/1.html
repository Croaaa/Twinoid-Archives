I always seem to get winkled out pretty quick.</cite><p>Ahright, a breakdown of the game.<br><a href="http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/journal/v/557" target="_blank">http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/journal/v/557</a></p><p>I woke up one morning and checked Mush. And low and behold, I was mush! To me that's when the game really started, before that I had just been RP'ing with the crew and dismantling the shower and treating the plants. But now the game really started.<br>My partner was Gioele, whom I hadn't heard much from but hoped he'd be good. I laid low, RP-flipped about the Mush on board, and continued with the way I was planning on RP'ing Hua against the Mush. Soon Gioele informed me that he would return with keyboard access and we could plan. Unfortunately for the first bit our online times didn't match up well, but that seemed to even out (my schedule is on a shift).<br>Gioele was high level, like almost twice my level, so took the lead in the plan he devised, our first plan: He would plant conversion-level amount of spores in one of the anabolics that the humans had already researched, so th first person who ate them would be Mush. It took some time, but fortunately he took Mycelium Spirit so even after ASG we had 3 spores. He infected the anabolics one night, and almost immediately after, Finola ate it.<br>I took anonymush immediately. Finola informed me of her low mush level, but I was okay with that - we were three and that was exciting in itself. The next day we were going to go on an expo, that had a cristallite zone, despite its not having oxygen. This excited me. I did everything I could to prevent those humans from turning tail, and joined the expo, trying to craft it so if we hit the mush trap, we'd get the best shot we could from it. <strong>Frieda</strong>, <strong>Roland</strong> and <strong>Jin Su</strong> joined the expo along with me. Donning spacesuits, we went down to the planet.<br>I did not have Traitor, mind you, only Anonymush. But we reached the beautiful cristallite zone and sure enough hit spore trap! Jin Su and Roland were spored, while Frieda was spared, and I acquired one spore. Best spore trap ever. I had extracted a spore right before we launched, just in case I had a shot to infect one of them, and we didn't have mycoalarms (Finola was actively holding the apron and pretending to be AFK, which I find hilarious in retrospect). But I plunked the spore I acquired on the surface on Roland, bringing his infection level to 2. So exciting! I quickly retreated to bravo dorm.<br>Soon Finola came online, and then Gioele was online, and we schemed. That's when I spotted it. Here I will note that someone (I assume the captain, Kuan Ti was inactve) had bought ACTOPI. And so I could tell that the dot sitting beautifully in Front Alpha Turret was Roland. Roland with 2 spores. Finola slipped up there, spiked him the final time, and took Anonymush. Then she retrieved the soap from Bravo Dorm, showering in the process, and made the best excuse I've ever heard - that she was researching the antispore soap.<br>Roland came on soon after, and informed us that his mush level was relatively low too, but still, we were 4. I didn't care much about mush level. Now things started to get hairy. The next day when I got up, I checked Mush to find that not only were we sitting in orbit of an oxy planet with seismic activity (6 oxygen left in the tanks, about the same in capsules on the bridge), but Finola and Roland were both in IB with currently offline Jin Su. Roland had spiked Jin Su, bringing him to 2, but a mycoalarm in the room went off, so Finola started spamming actions in the room. That's when we decided to do something we'd been thinking of the night before, right before we got Roland, to take IB. Not my favorite strategy but it sure worked. Finola retrieved 3 oxygen capsules (we had brainsync so she could still see chat, despite dropping her talkie), I retrieved 2 and slipped into Icarus Bay. With 4 in there, it was now full, and then I extracted openly and infected Jin Su. Mycoalarm rang out, but he was ours now. Roland was not online right then and didn't take anonymush, so 3 mush now sat in the crew bar, but what happened was pretty funny.<br>Chun panicked. Frieda panicked. Actually every human who was online did exactly what a human should and would probably do in that situation: Panicked. It's what I would have done. And it was hilarious. Gioele was at this point in a mush hunt chat and somehow trusted, and reported on what was said in that chat. He was asked to retrieve the final few oxygen capsules from the bridge and put them in, resulting in 2 extra O2 I think. He did. Then he stood in the room with the tank waiting for cycle change. Right before the cycle change he took them out again.<br>Then regrettably, the first person to die of lack of O2 was Jin Su, our new beta. He never woke up to see. But Gioele slipped into the room with his oxygen, and it was full again. Chun was moving about, a snow white dot in the tracker map, and I was relaying out the locations for those who didn't have their iTrackies/trackers. We kinda sat there for a bit, but one moment when Chun left a spot open (shouldn't have done that), Gioele slipped through, double-spiked Stephen and turned him, then returned to IB. We sat there for longer. waiting for cycle change and more people to suffocate.<br>Then Stephen wakes up. He kills Terrence. He sets fire to the dorm with Frieda in it. On Finola's orders he takes the plants and makes sure they can't be tended (not that they wer ever tended well) so they can't get oxygen. Next cycle, Frieda burns to death, Raluca suffocates, and Ian suicides, right in quick succession.<br>Leaving 2 humans: Chun and Paola. Paola was a brat on the bridge. I really hate it when someone says the mush got lucky. But whatever. We discussed our next move. Paola said we had a PILGRED trader off our bow and said goodnight and went offline. Chun's dot disappeared from the map. I went AFK to go to dinner. When I came back, er...<br>There was 28 oxygen. Chun had flown a patrol ship (piloting was unlocked) down to the planet, braved seismic, and come up with oxygen. That is perhaps the bravest Chun I've ever seen. Great move, seriously. That was incredible.<br>Next cycle (I think?) Gioele went to the bridge and double-spiked Paola, turning her. We had been discussing for awhile how to acquire the PILGRED trade. And in a very sad moment, of deciding who would be traded, Roland volunteered to step into the storage and be sent to the aliens. I was offline when it was done because Paola wasn't online yet before I had to go, but when I returned... Roland had set off to infect a new race and the Daedalus was back home, with Chun The Immune in tow, ready to stop the rebels (hopefully) and with a ripe Mush win.<br>I hope I've told the story well enough. I'm excited to hear the story from others' points of view, and I'm sorry if I left anything out, I'm telling this all from memory.</p><p>(notes wall of text)<br>(shrinks in chair)</p>

                <p>Also, I never suspected Hua or Gioele, between how patient they were being, and how helpful they seemed. especially hua took the time to give tips to me, Since I was a novice. Which, in hindsight lead to a sort of funny situation. I had a private channel going with Hua, and I tended to share my suspicions with them on the channel. (particularly I was blaming Ian and Frieda for leaving us Oxygen-low.)</p><p>In hindsight, I would have probably been an easy pawn to Hua, if they had taken advantage.</p>

                <p>I'd like to add my perspective, but things are pretty busy right now. For the moment though, I should say that ironically, in the last cycle before return to Sol, Chun had a panic attack and would have killed herself at the end of the cycle.</p><p>Finola: I'm not sure how I would have seen the conversion of Finola coming. I suspected she might be a stealth Alpha, since progress was slow and she was being intransigent. Eventually, when she agreed to go on the expo, I put her behaviour down to good RP, which she had shown since the beginning. There was nothing enough to warrant killing her, especially since my credibility was low from the Chao death.</p><p>Ian: Likewise. His gardening was not so hot and was exactly the sort of thing you'd expect from an Ian mush playing long game. If anything, it was too bad.. He was going to get knocked off post-expo.</p><p>Paola: Paola was generally helpful and communicative, but we'd missed a vital rebel base and so I was a little suspicious.</p><p>Gioele: Gioele aroused suspicion at the beginning with the 'I mistook the soap' thing.. he was dirty a couple of times, but nothing that was easily checkable while I was low on AP/MP. The generally helpful demeanour helped his case. After the Mush invasion of IB, he turned up and covered the oxygen.. I was thrilled and thought we might have a game. I was AFK over cycle change since I thought mush would stay in IB. I didn't expect Jin Su's death (I though that Humans died first when asphyxiating)and after Gioele had been in IB for a couple of minutes I got the sinking feeling..... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> It was a perfectly played deception.</p><p>Roland: Was the newbie cum mush where you can't quite tell whether it is a newbie or someone pretending to be new. I gave him the benefit of the doubt, partially because I don't like faked newbie play (deceive me, but don't take advantage of courtesy extended to new players). As it turned out, he was a newbie converted by mush and playing both teams accordingly. Hope you enjoyed the game!</p><p>Hua: Hua was my gut instinct for the perfect candidate mush. When I couldn't open a channel to you, I thought 'she's talking to someone else' and it's probably her. I couldn't do anything about it at the time and with so many other good 'candidates', I wasn't ever going to go on a random rampage. All in all, class A mush play.</p><p>It was unfortunate that Freida was messed up by Terrence. The fact that the Mush team kept playing the deception game past the rampage, meant that it was difficult to rally against it.</p><p>Maybe more later <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Cheers all.</p>

                <p>Actually, I recall now... one of the major reasons I suspected Hua was her keenness to go on the first mission and the subsequent awful performance in the mission. I figured somebody on the mission had 'traitor' and Hua was an excellent candidate under the cover of survivalist and pilot.</p><p>Also partially because I had been killed as a Hua mush from going on an early mission - two illnesses led to immediate termination. After that, I figured no mush would risk going on a mission with so many zones.</p><p>As it turns out, Hua was the mush, but didn't have traitor - go figure.</p>
