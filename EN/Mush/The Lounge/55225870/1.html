                <p>The ship in question was this one: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9898" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9898</a></p><p>I joined this ship as <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/terrence_archer.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_TA:" class="tid_ico"> Terrence <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/terrence_archer.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_TA:" class="tid_ico"> with Pilot, Drone and Tech skills, so it started of pretty well. Doing regular Terrence things, dismantling the shower, building sofa etc.<br>By the time the mush were selected, there'd been a problem: Ian, Chao, Finola and Raluca were inactive.</p><p>And I was <em>Mush</em>. Oh boy... I can't say I've done that a lot, so first things first, talk to my Co-alpha, who turned out to be Eleesha. So at least I was a bit lucky there, with no Chao and Mush-Eleesha, I didn't need to be so scared about hiding my actions.<br>And we quickly decided that with so little research potential in the human crew, we could go for a slow tactic.</p><p>And thus, both of us armed with splashproof and trapper, we began extracting and trapping every place we could. IB, RC, AB2, AB, BB, Refectory. Sometimes we even got in a direct infection on someone in a corridor, like when Roland decided to use the Magnet to land!</p><p>The problem with this strategy was that the spores were VERY evenly distributed. After a few days, <strong>every crewmember</strong> had 1 or 2 spores in them (Except Chun). By this point, I was firmly installed in B-dorm as Chun's little watchdog, reporting in on movements and dirtyness, taking particular care to mention anytime a human got dirty oddly and ignoring whenever Eleesha took a sneak shower.</p><p>As I was both Pilot and a tech, I had plenty of chances to get dirty with good excuses. And while on the surface I tried to appear as an active pilot/tech, I really only did bare minimum to pass by, extracting several spores per day instead. And things were looking good, Eleesha were a bit busy IRL and couldn't find the time to do any clever defacer-infections, but I didn't feel any rush to infect really.<br>Heck, I could barely FEEL any pressure, if anything I worried for Eleesha looking too inactive at worst.</p><p>Somewhere here, Janice went<em> inactive </em>in A-dorm, leaving me to fake my way out of the morale problems, but it seems the hunters never really looked into that, but I made sure to cook every ration I ate, just in case they did count it.</p><p>And that's when it happened. <strong><em>Murders</em></strong>. Not by us, oh no, I've had my fill of rampage action lately. It seems that the lack of any Chao for torture and that Eleesha found no leads must've lead the mush-hunters to target the more inactive players (The once-per-day actives it seemed).<br>Roland was the first to go. I shrugged, he was only at 1 spore and it gave me more excuses to trigger pilot traps on Hua or someone else. And it made me, as a tech/pilot even more valuable.</p><p>But I started worrying for Eleesha. I began planning a bit on my end, figuring if she could do a defacer move, just to guarantee a conversion at least, before she gets shot down.<br>No such luck, the mush-hunters were impatient with our mimicry. They cut down Hua, then Eleesha the same day. Then they suddenly turned on Frieda! I couldn't imagine that they had any leads on her at all, I doubt she even had a spore on her, so they must've jumped to the assumption that the mush, due to still seemingly being 2 players, must've gone deep stealth, and since that's a thing I've done myself as Frieda, I couldn't blame them.<br>Besides, they had Kuan-Ti, if she had been mush, it would've been worth the loss.</p><p>At this point, I was hoping that I'd at least survive the random murders until the next day, because Eleesha had taken the last spores for the day and we still had Gioele and Stephen on 2 spores each.</p><p>And I planned.<em> And planned</em>. I had +6 hours to plan what would be the killing stroke to the human crew.</p><p>Once the day changed, I dropped my Itrackie, took the scooter, wrench and went from B-dorm to Rear Bravo storage, took the armour I knew was still there. I went to A-dorm, picked <strong>anonymush</strong> and <em>infected Gioele </em>openly, planting the first layer of my coming quadruple bluff. He was now ours. I wrote down all the spore levels, skills and priority targets to mush chat for him when he woke up, because he would likely have full AP and solid to defend himself with <strong>(And I would likely be dead by then)</strong>.</p><p>I then went to the NERON-BIOS and changed settings, just in case I had to fall back on backup plans. I turned on food destruction, off death announcements, magnet net off, I left shield on in a moment of hesitation, trying to stay stealth for SECONDS longer, and research lock to avoid any rushed RFS if they had kept that secretly progressed. I hid my armour in the RC now, I would not need it for the next step of my plan and the AP was well-spent. In fact, I needed to use up much more of it if I were to succeed...</p><p>So I went into B-dorm again, dismantled the camera, because this was were Stephen slept, planting the 2nd layer of bluffs, because he was still human and I could not have infected him today.<br>I remembered from the A-dorm logs that it was Kuan-Ti who did all the cutting of humans. And there were still 2 humans in bridge. Likely him being filled with AP by Paola... So I baited my trap, dismantling the shower and taunting them.</p><p>To make the trap less obvious, I went to the refectory, cooking and eating a bunch of rations. This left me at 2 AP only, enough to chase someone with the scooter as Terrence, but not much more.<br>And Kuan-Ti came for me...<br>... With his 1 spore. <strong><em>TRANSFER TIME!!</em></strong></p><p>He had almost full AP, 1 mission from Jin-Su waiting AND the knife. I cut my old body to pieces as it fled to A-dorm, where he seemed to have stopped running and killed him before he could announce that I had infected Gioele.</p><p>Using his mush-hunter chat, I read all the things and their plans, which were pretty much what I had feared, they had gone for kills on less useful people in hopes that one was mush and caught one of us. I was to be killed after Pilgred was repaired and if I was not mush, they'd kill Gioele. The rest of them were confirmed humans at some point or another.</p><p>I tried emulating his written speech, although I don't really like to swear, and convinced Jin-Su to check on B-dorm, where he confirmed that the camera had been dismantled. I then convinced him to give me his new mission and then use all his AP to do unarmed punches on Stephen, who I then finished off.<br>I followed Jin-Su and stabbed him a bit for good measure, not really going to kill him with that few cuts, it was mostly because at this point I started to taunt and talk openly about my plans as well as recite crappy poetry <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>I was certain I would be killed, Paola still had shooter and 2 blasters, but with only her, Jin-Su and Chun against a full AP Solid-Gioele, I was certain that they were doomed. Heck, Pilgred was at 7%, so it's not like they had any chance to get home anyway, not since I killed my own body and took the body of the last Tech human.</p><p>I went to bed IRL and woke up to find myself assassinated ingame by Paola. And thus ends my point of view on the ship full of sporetraps!</p>

                <p>Well, I did basically stab Jin-Su and start the open poetry, while I <strong>could've</strong> pretended like nothing, I'd couldn't infect Stephen until the next day and Gioele showed no signs of logging in soon :S.</p><p>But the main reason... was that by transferring, I'd lost the Tech that Kuan-Ti had gained from a Skill Book. Even if Jin-Su didn't notice my different skillset, I'm sure that Paola, Chun or Stephen would've.<br>So I went with reducing the numbers as much as possible in one cycle, the mush-hunt chat mentioned how hard morale was getting for them, so I figured I'd basically doomed them on 3 different fronts there ^^.</p>

                <p>Ooh, nice job! I'm glad to know how that ship turned out. <br>I was Frieda. I was getting kinda nervous about the mush, since they didn't really seem to be doing anything. I figured I should just stick to planet scanning though. <br>I felt like we were doing pretty well all things considered, but then Kuan Ti killed me out of nowhere. <br>I'd love to know why he did that. I was active, always stayed under cameras, and I don't think I ever entered Bravo dorm at all. I would have done a food test or something if he asked.</p>

                <p>I think Kuan-Ti got paranoid when none of the inactives were mush, maybe he thought we were using anonymush and hiding our numbers?<br>From the mush-hunt chat, all I could deduce was that they thought the random killings would work out, thinking that I'd finish Pilgred with them....</p><p>Honestly, I'm not sure how they should've handled it after killing Eleesha... Maybe rushing the RFS and using it on me? I would be the highest value due to Tech/Pilot, but it seems they never considered that, I guess because they lacked the disk maybe?

                <p>Basically. They had no real chance to uncover who were the mush in time without murder, since we were very careful and patient <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">. Sure, I got dirty a lot, but it was always by doing something important for the crew. They basically went for the most inactive first, hoping that THAT was the reason it was so quiet. Once the inactive and once-per-day actives were gone, they had to turn to the rest... and they probably figured they needed me to help with Pilgred.<br>And they would've left Gioele for last apparently, because they were able to keep track of his AP ^^.</p>
