                <p>[AP] Misery Business<br><br>This is the story about a wealthy coffee addict, a skilled pilot, and ... another... who were all very happy. <br><br>It began on day one... when everyone woke up they were all so glad. Such an active crew! Many gold users! They would get to Eden for sure if the RNG gods willed it. Yet, something was wrong. Gioele felt a corruption within his veins. Disgusting, putrid, human flesh surrounded his perfect, Mushy core. He was in a human host. Roland too could feel this, and both Roland and Gioele cried out in dismay in their dreams.<br><br>Were the other crew lost Mush, hidden away in a freezer too just like them? No. They were actual humans. To the core. Roland and Gioele again dismayed. The crew was so good - good potential Mush, but not Mush! It was unfortunate that surely they could not give all of them their own cold serenity, the everlasting embrace that is Mush. Some would not be able to share their joy. They would have to die.<br><br>All was well for the Human crew. Except for three minor annoyances... the Chun was for the most part silent, and decided to finish unnecessary projects only to go brain dead for a while in a turret. Chao and Stephen too both appeared to sustain brain damage and stood idle in Ref, both dirty, both seemingly the Mush, but were not.<br><br>Roland and Gioele both began their work immediately. They decided that unlike many ships of their past lives, where Mush were dispatched quickly for making too many obvious mistakes... they both would play their early roles well in an attempt to dispel suspicion. Fortunately for our Mushy heroes the Human members of the crew were not so careful, and made many small mistakes which could be seen as Mush sabotage. Getting dirty without saying? Taking key items away from where they should be? Finishing projects no one wanted? Such was their fate, and Mush luck.<br><br>The Mush had two primary threats, and one primary target. The Jin seemed very skilled and knowledgeable, and was likely ready to act at any moment to dispatch an obvious Mush threat. Eleesha too with her power to print The List made her a crucial target for Mush to turn. Finally, Ian, with his defensive skills would be an ideal asset for if things became bloody.<br><br>Gioele and Roland both worked diligently. Doing enough human work, doing just enough good... resetting research and projects. Killing all humans… ahem, hunters, collecting scrap. The ship had 100 hull, and 100 plasma shield, plus some decent research, and projects completed! Gioele even got the Gold Kitchen as a useless token display of non-Mushdom. By day 2 gas was finished, and by day 3 Mush could only make 2 spores a day, but it was already too late.<br><br>The other work also bore fruit, and with subterfuge they were able to keep their trails less obvious. Hua took the apron out of the lab, and Gioele used it as an excuse to feign getting dirty while relaying research. He quickly went to Alpha Dorm, picked up the soap, and dropped it. He was <em>clean</em> now, and if anyone were to check his life with a medkit he would be at full health without having left the room after. But spores were still created, and showers were taken covertly. By day 3 Terrence, Ian, and Eleesha were spored by traps.<br><br>The Mush sang in their dreams. "<em>Eleesha</em>/, we know you will join us soon. When you do... take anonymush. The humans need not panic. They will all join us soon one way or another."<br><br>When the Mush awoke Eleesha was turned by a final trap around day 3-4. She was <em>ready</em> to fight for her new life as a Mush, and proved to be masterful at her new found calling.<br><br>The crew went on two expos. The first only O2 was collected. Gioele insisted that Chun pick up the hacker kit, but she did not. The expo was not lost, but only because Mush was not yet ready. The second, well...<br><br>The plan was simple. Jin, Hua, and Terrence would go on expo. Roland was conveniently AFK, and Gioele was on a "mobile device" so could not move around... which was a lie. Since Chun was brain dead more or less she didn't pick up the armor or hacker kit, and so once the expo team left... Eleesha quickly loaded a fuel, hacked the bridge, moved the ship, demoralized a few people, and then switched bodies with Ian. Jin, Hua, and Terrence were dead, and many of the crew were at severe lack of moral.<br><br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>NERON</strong>: [Hax!] Alternate reality black box recording has been discovered.

Hua, Terrence and Jin Su at Icarus Bay? If we leave them in the planet, I'll be the only Pilot left. Hacker Kit at Bravo Dorm, too. I can demoralize Raluca to death afterwards so others will be doomed.<br><br>Gioele :Hacking the bridge usually takes a full bar of AP I've found. Killing away team will remove many key players.<br><br>Eleesha : I like the idea of moving the ship during an expo. One of us could try and move the ship and then swap out into a new body, kill the old.<br> <br>Roland : Eleesha, just so you know Ian already has a spore so you can transfer to him afterwards without any sporing. You might want to pick up/drop Schrodinger a few times before transferring, so your old body is easier to kill. :&gt;<br><br>Gioele : If "Eleesha" loads fuel, and then hacks bridge to move ship, and then goes and dies by Ian's hand - where you are now in Ian that may be a good strategy. He only has two skills, I think? It would be a human death and we can just be like "WTF griefer! Why do humans do that!!???"<br><br>Gioele : As long as you have the AP to: 1. load 1 fuel 2. hack bridge 3. hurt yourself a bit 4. body switch with Ian 5. kill your old body then yes move the ship next expo<br><br>Eleesha : That sounds like a plan. I'm at 7 ap though, a touch worried I won't have the energy to do it. Any idea where the cat is?<br><br>Gioele : If Ian has the armor you as Ian will be very hard to kill. Before you body swap from your old body you could say something like "This ship is boring. I'm off to a better one now so please kill me already, nerds." Then switch, then kill your old body as Ian. And if you need help killing your old body just let us know and we can at least do that because it obviously went into griefer mode.<br><br>Ian : Swapped, but Eleesha isn't dead. In Medlab, no walky talking, needs finishing quick. She should have about 1-2 hp.<br><br><strong>&gt;&gt; Begin ship comms</strong><br><br>NERON : Announcement: Leaving immediate orbit Navigations systems frozen for 1 cycles.<br><br>NERON : Death registered : Terrence, cause : « Abandoned ».<br><br>NERON : [Hax!] Haha...

[KZz] Death registered: Jin Su, cause « Abandoned ».<br><br>Eleesha : I thought I should print the list before you all kill me.<br><br>Eleesha : Chun - Mush<br><br>Ian : Eleesha is the medlab! Someone needs to finish her. I'm leaving the room so my pacifist doesn't effect things.<br><br>NERON : Death registered : Eleesha, cause : « Assassinated ».<br><br>Paola : Killed her and got a migraine.... I just knew she was mush!! No activity by day 4 pfft. I had no evidence to back it up though. <br><br>Janice : What the heck is happening?<br><br>Paola : Eleesha moved the ship while Terrence, Jin Su &amp; Hua were on an expo.<br><br>Finola : Report that idiot griefer, thanks.<br><br><strong>&lt;&lt; End ship comms</strong><br><br>Ian : "<em>Report that idiot griefer, thanks.</em>" Oh. My. GOD! I can't believe it worked. I even dropped the knife and passed it over to Ian. <br><br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>NERON</strong>: Black box recording complete. [HAAX!!]<br><br>Eleesha! The crew was furious. She Must be a Mush! Kill her! And so they did, but the ship only showed one more human dead. What could it mean? Now four, and even after they all together chanted... griefer... griefer... Eleesha the griefer! But she was not. Eleesha had been playing to win, and now was hosted by the body of Ian. All according to plan.</p>

                <p>Chao and Stephen had not dropped died from starvation yet, and perhaps it was assumed that they were the Mush still. No one had noticed that Ian was missing a skill, nor that he had picked up the knife. Gioele feigned demoralization, picking up armor, and the medkit. Roland had spores, and all three were ready for blood.</p><p>The Mush passed the time waiting to act throwing up worthless distractions. Does anyone need healing? Has anyone taken the coffee yet? I don't know what to do now will someone please tell me? Many directions. No answers. No actual help, only illusion. Did they suspect any of the Mush before? Probably, but who could say for sure when real humans acted so mushy themselves? And after? Maybe the humans who remained didn't want to live any longer.</p><p>Assuming that were the case the Mush decided to grant them their wish. They crafted the other grenade, and held onto some key items… armor, knife, medkit. It was Roland who did the real damage.</p><p>NERON : Death registered : Paola, cause : « Assassinated ».</p><p>NERON : [Hax!] Haha... [Haaax!] HeheHEHE. ONE down. ONE DOWN ! Hyyyaaah! Frieda DEAD.

They suffered from brain freeze and were no good anyway other than as morale failsafe if the rest of the crew’s deaths would be denied by the mighty RNG gods. They served the Mush well in life as scapegoats, and in death as morale penalties.<br><br>NERON : Death registered : Chao, cause : « Assassinated ».<br><br>NERON : Death registered : Stephen, cause : « Assassinated ».<br><br>Five deaths in a few short minutes. And then there were four. Janice, Kuan Ti, Raluca and Chun. Raluca probably suspected something, but didn’t act in time. Gioele, EIan, and mutant Roland were now in Alpha Dorm waiting for EIan to be able to act next.<br><br>Gioele still played the role of the totally-not-a-Mush for a while longer. He even attempted to see if the remaining crew who were alive could be compelled into attack each other, because one of them <em>had</em> to be the last real Mush. But this did not happen. Gioele decided to stab Raluca a few times, but missed a ton, cut his own tongue, and lost the knife in the exchange. RNG! EIan returned, and helped finished the job of slaying, and on Day 5 Cycle 8 Gioele landed the final blow on Raluca to finish off the humans.<br><br>Then only the Mush remained alive. They were all very calm.

Nice to see Gioele write a wonderful post(s) for the after party and take my suggestion of using a Paramore song as title. At first, I was glad to have an active ship. We had about 4 Pilots, 2 Astrophysicist, active newbies, a bunch of Gold players, an alive Chun and our 2 inactives fortunately didn't have an important job in the ship. But everything changed when the mush selection happened. Since mush partner Gioele was active, we decided to play the converting game from the start.</p><p>I've made a few roleplay post for the first few days such as flirting with Paola, getting negative points from Jin Su's King Book, calling the crew the Daedalus Family and even claiming my Patrol Ship Moon Moon just so I can get a bed in the Shower Dorm. Thank you, Ian, for giving me the bed. I won't forget it &lt;3. Also let's not forget about Paola getting a Plasma Shield from Neron Upgrades on Day 1-2, Frieda scanning appropriate planets for the ship, Raluca/Kuan Ti/Janice finishing the projects, Terrence starting his own drone army with a Robotics Expert Mage Book for another Blueprint and Ian getting us quickly to 7 pots with his Green Thumb.</p><p>Antispore Gas wasn't finished until D2C8 fortunately, so we got a bunch of traps in Rear Corridor (we didn't even trap other places!). Eleesha two of her spores from using her free Search (I think). Ian got one when the scooter was still kept in RC while Terrence had two of them. Finally, Eleesha got her last spore when I sent her a PM to take the Babel Module Blueprint from Rear Corridor to Alpha Bay 2. And then Constipaspore was finished. We planned on finishing Terrence and then trapping the lab before Cycle 8 to convert Ian since it had no Camera. Raluca, Kuan Ti and Finola would probably be our next victims when we suddenly had a second expedition.</p><p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_727053 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="727053">pkeod</span></span><cite>Roland : Wait... Hua, Terrence and Jin Su at Icarus Bay? If we leave them in the planet, I'll be the only Pilot left. Hacker Kit at Bravo Dorm, too. I can demoralize Raluca to death afterwards so others will be doomed.</cite></p><p>After the commotion was done, people lynched original Ian without question. It was good luck on our part that the human team wasn't really careful of who to kill. Eleesha-Ian didn't have Green Thumb and Ian-Eleesha probably has only 1 skill. After that, Gioele became our Commander and Elee-an was safe from suspicion for a while. I dunno what you guys thought about me, though. :&gt;</p><p>A few cycles later, I realized I still have 2 spores with me and a mission from Gioele. At Cycle 6, I had a full AP bar. With "It's My Life" as my BG Music, I decided to end the misery of the rest of you guys. I have to apologize to Finola after reading her last words. I'm really sorry if you didn't want me to do it, but since it's obvious that the human team has little chance to win against us mush, I decided to spare some of our remaining player's Gold Days (namely Paola and Gioele). Hope you understand. ^^</p>

                <p>Yes... Mush victory in that ship was inevitable after Eleesha joined us and without an active Chao. We could have drawn it out longer, converted more people, but we wanted to end it all fast as good opportunities presented themselves. As important the hacker kit is, losing 3 high value humans on an expo is worse. One of the humans should have insisted on taking it with them. I think the ship would have ended differently with a more active Chun. Research would have been done faster, and key items would have been more secure.</p><p>Humans, post, please! Did you have any secret Mush hunting going on? It didn't seem like any human was really using PMs for ant-Mush communication.</p><p>Even though I was Mush I did still give out a lot of useful information, and tips to the newbies to help them learn the game, but I did not mention things like Mush tests. We could have easily been caught with Medkit test for example.</p>
