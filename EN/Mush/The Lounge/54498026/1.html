                <p>Now the ship is over, I can explain a few things.</p><p>I was Gioele, an alpha mush. My partner was Raluca. Raluca had extracted the first day's spore allowance and was resting in AB2. Pre-mush, she had dismantled the alpha dorm shower. When I woke, one of the first things I did was to build the sofa, I also installed my two cameras.</p><p>The ship had some new players, and some newbie mistakes meant they were killed. Two players worked on unwanted projects even after Jin Su explained, so they were assassinated. Jin Su caught agoraphobia.</p><p>Jin Su asked me to move a new player from the bridge so I took that opportunity to do a quick look at the crew. Paola, Frieda and Jin Su all had starting spores. After I relayed Heat Lamps, I took the opportunity to extract 2 spores and then take a stealth shower. Magnetic Return had been completed and that newbie player had to be assassinated before any more damage was done. Terrence attacked and then Jin Su finished off. I took the opportunity then to deface Bravo dorm and convert Jin Su with infector. I decided not to take Anonymush because defacer would have been noticed sooner rather than later. Roland walked in, announced the third mush and defacer. He attacked me down to 3hp, but I attacked with Jin Su getting the kill. After Roland's death, Terrence comes online and correctly deduces my mushiness:</p><p>"Gioele is the Alpha.. He infected Jin Su.. I checked the private message for their online status.. Jin Su was recent while Gioele is online."</p><p>Then, Terrence notices there's an extra death and suspects Roland of being mush too. However, it was Roland who was dead and human.</p><p>I head to the bridge and transfer into Paola. I could match her skills: logistics and rebel. Chao checked a terminal or two. I then kill Gioele. I then said that Terrence was wrong.</p><p>I noticed Astropad had recently been updated by Mankind's Only Hope - Stephen, in AB2 where Raluca was. However, this was just before I converted Jin Su. I was hoping that it would sow a little bit of doubt as to who was the beta mush. Janice investigates a cycle after my mushy actions, and turns off peace-core. She asked Terrence to leave and then threw a grenade. Jin Su escapes in a patroller with the knife and blaster, with 1 hp to spare. Janice then hacks the command terminal to take us to Frieda's small planet with oxygen although there was one unknown zone (I discover it to be strong winds), abandoning Jin Su. Janice announces that she has a clear idea about the second mush, but doesn't know what to do because the third one could be listening... I decide not to push and leave it be.</p><p>I start on Xyloph (before I became Paola, the body had upgraded Neron twice - Doors, and Plasma Shield - Janice had been a little slow turning it on), and get wireless fidelity. Sol was down for a few cycles.</p><p>Sleep. The planet is explored by Janice and Kuan Ti (without our only pilot - Terrence). 24 oxygen and 4 steaks were obtained! I had briefly flirted with the idea of damaging the tanks and holding o2, before going to sleep but that would have meant my death. So, I wake up and I can breathe again.</p><p>I wake up to find the ship has left orbit. That means we lost Kaladaan. When I transferred into Paola, she was demoralized and at 3 morale. Later, I hug the cat and ask Janice for hugs, which she gave as I wanted to appear human. Sol is connected and I get the chef book. I save some ap. Terrence had taken out 6 hunters, leaving 2 trax and an asteroid.</p><p>Janice thought Raluca was the converted mush and kills her. I waited patiently and decided to convert someone around day change. I chose whoever was in Bravo Dorm, hoping it would either be Janice or Terrence. It turned out to be Janice. I defaced the dorm in c1 then headed back to the bridge, clean.</p><p>I left Janice a message in the mush channel informing her of Frieda's starting spore. With spore sucker, I hoped she hadn't removed it. Janice had informed me she had used it and found no spore before I got her around day change. She had full ap and rampaged. She killed the only pilot, and transferred into Frieda and killed Chao. Sadly, Frieda had 0 morale and so died at the next cycle.</p><p>I decide to try to finish off the crew, fail but did shoot Ian with shooter points and try to punch Stephen. Finola had gone inactive and Ian became Neron Admin. The start of d6c7 saw a wave of 24 hunters. I was biding my time in BD when Stephen slaughtered me. There were a couple of fires when I was still alive, burning for some cycles, but:</p><p>NERON : Kudos to Kuan Ti, who was brave enought to report a fire despite that drawing attention to their embarrassing inability to deal with it themselves. Could you maybe help them? We're talking about my whole being here: it is UR-GENT!</p><p>Watched from the dead page for a while, I hadn't expected the ship to survive this long after. At day change, Stephen died. However, the hunters have breached the shield, so only a matter of time when 24 enemies out there would destroy the ship.</p><br><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9701" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9701</a></p>

                <p>Well I did say I would check in here. Been thinking about what to say, but Morgaine really covered everything very thoroughly. I was Jin Su. Gioele was high on my suspects list, because he literally did nothing, but I had nobody to trust, many other humans who were mushy as could be, and other humans actively trying to hurt our progress. Gioele did well to infect me all by himself. Terrence could just as easily have been Mush as I was, but they guessed right. By the time I fled on a patroller, I was going to throw out misinformation that Terrence shouldn't have converted me, killed Roland and outed me as a Mush just so he could look human, but by the time I hit enter, Janice had already hacked the ship to move and I was left behind. Well done to Gioele for transferring into Paola and getting away with it, and even managing to convert more.</p>
