But it gave me a crucial advantage when I saw that I had finally been chosen to carry out the Mother Mush's will. We had lots of at least semi-talkative people, making a long long run a difficult proposition. I even saw my first <strong>Creative Apprentice</strong> Stephen <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/stephen_seagull.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_SS:" class="tid_ico"> on this ship (I think you bought gold after mush spawn sensing that the ship had potential?), it was also nice doing some out-loud and pre-death whispering mush hunting with you, <strong>Chao</strong> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/wang_chao.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_WC:" class="tid_ico">. Here's how it all went down from my perspective (at least quickly I've gotta sleep soon enough). I spawn into the ship, and it's D2C3. Take a glance at my surroundings and look at all the rooms. There's someone idling in Rear Corr for whatever reason and that ALSO happens to be where the <strong>wrench</strong> was last seen in the inventory/astropad. And I won't let a good opportunity go to waste. Carefully I sneak through the corridors, making sure to avoid medlab (though I know Finola is my partner) for fear of garnering ANY suspicion. Refresh, extract twice, continue moving. It's the portly novice Jin Su, I give him a little sporey pat on the butt, pick up the wrench and make my way to Alpha to dismantle the shower for my legitimate dirty excuse. It's <strong>essential</strong>, after all, to have sofa up for Paola. I let my partner Finola in on my plans to convert Jin on D2C8-&gt;D3C1 cycle change, we'll just need an alibi for accessing bridge or perhaps an enticing NERON project for him to want to relay on. With him in our fold the scenarios for a delicious death scene would be endless... fuel stranding, Pilgred Rush, Expo abandoning, but first, a nice long sleep in real life and in game.

                <p>Hey, Jin Su here, was a pleasure to work with such competent mush allies, even all I did was minimal and draw attention to myself near the end.</p><p>Anyway was very fun, got infected due to not wanting to waste Ap getting back into the dorm with no free beds and the camera in the bridge not being set up soon enough. And then a few days later you all died due to crowding the dorms and not paying attention afterwards.</p><p>If any of you had bothered to look at the log after the attack went off (looking at you Raluca and Gioele) you would have saw it was Finola that set the grenades off. Honestly I was wondering when you guys were going to kill me, I didn't exactly try to cover my tracks towards the end.</p><p>Also starting to dislike Chao players, but that may be because his character is seems to be better suited to fighting and thus attracts the trigger happy fools.<br>Please tell me I am wrong.</p><p>So, it was fun, hope I can see you all again sometime, I learned some stuff. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
