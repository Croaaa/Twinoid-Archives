                <p>Final edit - <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7714" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7714</a> - the ship managed to make it home to sol.</p><p>Human Gioele here with Paranoid, Astro, Coffee and Solid.</p><p>I am following the aftermath of my death. Will they make it back to sol (pilgred is complete)?</p><p>I will say this, I love my Paola! My baby daughter all grown up.</p><p>I typed a lot out earlier. It is quite a bit.</p><p>Part 1:</p><p>One of the first things I do on full ship is to take the 3 skills to go with paranoid. I then pick up both the microwave and freezer depositing the freezer in Icarus bay and microwave in RBT. Chun wonders where these two kitchen appliances are….</p><p>First up, we had to contend with several tutorial players. Janice hadn’t left the lab until I moved her out once. She died from starvation.</p><p>Finola started the tutorial and ended up on the bridge, but I shoved her out to FAT so Frieda could get my daughter’s logistics bonus. Traded for a hydropot which in itself was traded for oxygen and fuel.</p><p>Kuan Ti was another tutorial player. Dropped talkie etc, held hacker kit, armor and blaster. He hacked the command terminal, turned the ship, and tried to move it while Roland was still outside. Luckily no fuel. He was tough to kill and I didn’t finish it. He then dropped those items and picked up the grenade I saw in storage (noticed it was missing from the Radio terminal). Continue attacking in Alpha Dorm. He drops the grenade. I can’t finish him off so pick the grenade up and take it to the bridge. I notice I can throw it because the peace core had been turned off by Terrence. Jin Su finally kills him.</p><p>Stephen is tutorial chef, and gradually cooked all the rations. Chun killed him.</p><p>Ian is tutorial. He is dirty gardening in the garden. He says he has broken fingers. He then goes to kick Chun off medlab bed. She retakes it. Later, she then organises some crew to attack him. Meanwhile, my daughter has got the xyloph list.</p><p>Xyloph, 4th January 3154, Crew fungal analysis results, the important bits:<br>Subject: Roland Result: Negative<br>Subject: Ian Result: Negative<br>Subject: Eleesha Result: Negative</p><p>Ian is not one of the alpha mushes, but Chun is still convinced he could have been turned.</p><p>In the meantime, an o2 tank breaks. I fail to fix. <br>The Oxygen Tank smells of burning. Have you tried knitting...<br>The Oxygen Tank is still broken. As tiredness takes hold, you believe the machine is talking ot you, telling you "You might as well kiss a wookie"...<br>Jin Su fixes it.</p><p>the story continues in a bit.</p>

                <p>I am sorry Chun here. Roland was in private with me and right before he died said you were mush for sure. That on all the expos you had been draining him and to avenge him if he died. I learned a good lesson on that if someone is always dirty that he might not be mush. So I am sorry Gioele for killing you at the end.</p><p>We are hoping to get home. Paola made Frieda commander to send us to sol but she is afk..She is also holding the hacker kit.</p><p>- Again sorry playing Chun for my first time was a learning experience and I was way to paranoid. Again I am sorry for the mistake and learned alot that game.</p><p>-Chun</p>

                <p>While I wait for the ship to finish, the story can also continue later. Let me address the expeditions.</p><p>The 2nd expedition:</p><p>Desert - Nothing; Aliens gave 2 steaks; then it went a little pear-shaped.<br>Intelligent Life - Fight ... Team takes 6 damage<br>Then we breathe again with 24 units of oxygen<br>Then we go climbing in the mountains (fatigue).<br>Predators - Fight ... Team takes 6 damage. I catch the flu (more on illnesses later).</p><p>That expedition had one of the mush on. They may or may not have taken traitor. However, everyone is still alive.</p><p>The 3rd expedition I was only online for part of:</p><p>Ruins - Nothing to Report<br>Ruminants - Accident - Roland was wearing (dark) Red (!) and an alien cow charged at him.<br>Intelligent Life - Fight ... Team takes 7 damage<br>Predators - Accident - Roland is tasty. <br>Intelligent Life - Fight ... Team takes 7 damage - if Roland wasn't dead by the previous zone, he was dead by now. I get a migraine from witnessing his death. <br>Cristalite - Mush Trap - Pheromodem showed one of us survivors at a level 1 infection. That means someone 25% on the way to being Mush (Mushovore was complete).<br>.....<br>During one of the combat zones, I catch yet again Flu.</p><p>While that is an unlucky set of outcomes, on one ship, we did query a similar number of bad events, but no mush were involved.</p><p>Flu is a nasty disease. There is a chance of throwing up on changing rooms (I threw up throughout the ship, but not in every room, I wanted to spew in medlab for you to see, but there was no more last meal in me at that time...) As well as vomiting which makes you dirty, even if clean, there is a chance of getting dirty anyway at cycle change, then there is a chance of health loss at cycle change, and one I also suffered was loss of 1ap at cycle change.</p><p>Gastroenteritis was another disease I had from witnessing what I had done to one of the mush - deaded them. That also results in throwing up on room changes (again, not every room change).</p>

                <p>Roland is actually the person on the ship who I was in private with the whole game. You will see on the game post that he thought Gioele was the alpha mush. I made a mistake but I was not the only person who thought Gioele was mush. I learned alot from this game and I am sorry if I ruined anyones time. That was never my intention. Sorry. But Soroosh I was talking to other people. I am not just making it up.</p>

                <p>Part 2.</p><p>Frieda is tutorial but is doing a great job of looking for planets. While she looks for one, there are two fires on the ship. One was put out by Jin Su in Bravo bay. I noticed that the magebook I found earlier from my attempt to take up knitting, has gone. I suggest the fire is in CBS. A few cycles later, I notice it is still burning and I go in.</p><p>DAY 4 CYCLE 4<br>Gioele put out the fire! 1min<br>Gioele entered the room 1min<br>DAY 4 CYCLE 3<br>Terrence left the room ~3h<br>Terrence entered the room ~3h<br>DAY 4 CYCLE 2<br>The Blueprint has been destroyed! ~7h<br>The Oxygen Tank is broken! ~7h<br>DAY 3 CYCLE 8<br>The Book has been destroyed!</p><p>Terrence claimed he didn’t see any of that because he was accessing the game on his mobile. I sometimes access the game and can relate to some interactive issues, but I can still read room logs. I had food-tested in the lab but Chun didn’t seem to take any notice of it.</p><p>Paola invites me into the human channel. I mentioned to her about my suspicions about Terrence.</p><p>Jin Su gave missions to my daughter for comms. Frieda was doing really well - the first planet we visit doesn’t have o2 on and with Finola traded eventually for o2, so off we go but Ian forgets to take a spacesuit. Not to worry. Jin Su started the expedition on 10hp, but earlier, I noticed he had picked up the medkit. Alarm bells rang. No sign of ship crashing around except on Frieda and I healed her once. So, the following morning, Jin su tries to move the ship in c4 as the rebel base signal transmits, but luckily there was no fuel. I kill Jin Su, mush. I then have to take Chao out as he is new and hasn’t said anything but is “active”</p>

                <p>Part 3.</p><p>Then, the second expedition is for oxygen. We get 24 and can breathe easily.</p><p>Chun still can’t believe I am still dirty. On that second expedition, in the Predator zone, we have a fight and I contract flu. I throw up here, I throw up there. Cured myself with medkit kit.</p><p>Terrence is still my number one suspect after Jin Su. He was happy for Jin Su to stand in corridors to help him move. In a pm, Terrence had mentioned he thought Jin Su was mush (90% sure). I kill him and he was indeed mush and I have yet another disease, gastroenteritis. Chun wants me to eat a pill in medlab and it does indeed cure gastro. Terrence had turned off death messages.</p><p>Third planet has cristalite. We head to that but stay in orbit until pheromodem is done. All is quiet. However, we lose Eleesha to starvation, we don’t know in game. She had been active earlier on the ship though. So we cannot be sure if we are mush free. Only person I can suggest who could have been converted was Raluca who although had done a lot of research, was idle in the corridors.</p><p>We head down to the planet but Roland is totally unlucky and dies. Two crew left, Ian and myself. One of us has picked up a spore - : <br>pmdaof has been infected during a Mush raid during an exploration mission. Their contamination level is now 1.<br>I had a migraine, auto-cured, possibly from Roland’s death as I was not online throughout the expedition. I also have Flu yet again. I load a fuel, and head to the bridge, still dirty - no point cleaning up with Flu.</p><p>Roland and Hua are brilliant pilots. Terrence didn’t seem to do any piloting or even any drone upgrading. Hua though seemed to log in just once a day. Fair enough, not everyone can log in more than that.</p><p>My darling daughter, Paola is brilliant. She rushed ASG with Chun, but did eventually receive missions from Jin Su and myself later, for comms work. She did a wonderful job. I love my baby daughter with all my heart, even when she dated that Turkish bloke.</p><p>Raluca works a lot on research and in the nexus. After pheromodem is done, she, with help, completed Pilgred. I announce that I will press the button soon so people can say a few words. Then Chun murders me, says I am mush. Well, as we all know, Chun can’t be mush but if she wasn’t Chun, then we’d assume she was a mush. However, she was supposed to have secured the hacker kit but used all her ap on me! Frieda comes to help and finds the hacker kit. Frieda found it. No ap to hack though.</p><p>Paola : <br>You killed Gioele Chun?<br>See! only two orange people on the comrades bar.<br>So, no more than two mush are dead.<br>Gioele was a f** human the whole time.<br>Damn.. damn..<br>I personally hide the hacker kit in the front turret and i said it in the humans proven chat.<br>You just dont read everything.</p>

Roland was in private with me and right before he died said you were mush for sure. That on all the expos you had been draining him and to avenge him if he died. I learned a good lesson on that if someone is always dirty that he might not be mush. So I am sorry Gioele for killing you at the end.</p><p>We are hoping to get home. Paola made Frieda commander to send us to sol but she is afk..She is also holding the hacker kit.</p><p>- Again sorry playing Chun for my first time was a learning experience and <em>I was way to paranoid.</em> Again I am sorry for the mistake and learned alot that game.</p><p>-Chun</p></cite><p>It sounds more like you weren't paranoid enough!
