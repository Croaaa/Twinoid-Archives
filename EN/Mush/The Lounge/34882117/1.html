                <p>Hey guys, Frieda here!<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1881" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1881</a></p><p>I really want to hear how the ship ended up. Here's my side of the story - I jumped late MMM2, and was rewarded by being Alpha mush Frieda, with Hua &gt;_&lt;. This was my 2nd time as mush (Hua's first) and being mush is never my favorite thing. I prefer being friends and holding hands and roleplaying and laughing and laughing and laughing. But well, someone has to play the villain.</p><p>This wasn't a bad ship to be mush on. Vital items were not protected by Chun (I hid the hacker kit and told her where it was, in part to keep an eye on it, but also to protect it from griefers). Research was really slow with Finola doing not anti-mush researchy things and Chun having a RL crisis for the early part of the game. The crew that was awake was awesome, and I felt bad that my role was to stab you in the back. I planned to have bad planet rolls until a crisis, but to be honest, I didn't have to fake it. Volcanos just turned up everywhere.</p><p>Randomly in the first day or so Roland went on a murderous spree, killed Eleesha and then stood calmly in Adorm. I tried to talk to him, but he didn't answer, so I killed him with the consent of the crew. I hope someone turned him in for griefing, because I forgot ^^;; but random murderers are bad for humans and mush alike. The only plus was that the list could not be printed now.</p><p>Shortly after the subject of testing came up - and we agreed to do it, though there was no follow through. Crew, I learned from this to post anti-mush-testing before mush is assigned because I hate it. I really do - and I worry that you guys think that it might be because I am mush. This isn't the case. For our ship, we should have been feeding Janice the bananas that you were saving to testing, and then her moral wouldn't have been so low. Also, anyone can follow along with people's moral with pen and paper - not posting it doesn't stop mush from knowing that I could have totally taken Janice out. Take care of your peeps, guys!</p><p>Hua was also nice to work with, although we basically bickered the whole time as to strategy and what to do. I also was forced to phagocyte my first spores when I kept getting injured doing human things like picking stuff up and getting crushed by steel plates so I wouldn't be too obvious when I asked for healing. However, with the tech book sitting out in the open, we hatched a plan to convert Raluca and go back to Sol.</p><p>Ian came to trust me, and we started a mush hunting thread - inviting in Raluca &amp; Terrence (both human at the time). There were several inactives, as well as some suspicious actions on the crew so there was a lot to discuss.</p><p>On Day 3, someone gifted me with gold, giving me slots for two extra skills, right before our expedition. I stayed up really late that night, wracked with guilt as I watched our team get pummeled and Chao nearly die. We all pulled through however (with no o2) and a few cycles later I saw my opportunity to turn Raluca. I spiked her and took anonymush.</p><p>I posted the plan for Hua &amp; Raluca to work on Pilgred, but Hua moved a little too fast and got caught by Terrence. Once again I was stuck - I only had 2 AP, no spores and no way to really help Hua. She didn't take my advice to run, and was quickly done in by Terrence, our stealthy wheeled assassin. The ship was facing a different crisis though, in that we had 30 armor and needed to move. I grabbed the hacker kit where I had hidden it, and tried to move us and failed - dropping the hacker kit for the next person, I waited for the next turn - but luckily commander Chao woke up and moved the ship.</p><p>At this point Chun came back online, and she and Ian started up another mush hunt. I found this dialog particularly enjoyable (once I was added to the conversation).</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Chun</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">My current Mush suspicions are Frieda and Kuan Ti. Kuan Ti because of how he survived the fire and Frieda because of that awful expedition. She's a smart player and taking Traitor to screw up expeditions (something she has control over) seems like the kind of cunning move she would play. Thoughts?</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Chun</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"> I'll admit that's a pretty flimsy piece of evidence but I don't have much to work on, people seem to be doing their jobs. </span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Ian</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Ian : hmm, well Hua was one. I personally am very suspect of Finola - i dont know exactly what she has been doing with her AP, but it sure has not been going towards research like it is supposed to. She has been wandering around the ship strangely as well. possibly noob, but possibly mush</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Ian</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"> I dont think its Freida, only because she has been too helpful to the human team to date. too proactive &amp; helpful. quite possibly the other is kuan ti I agree.</span></span></p><p>Unfortunately for me, Raluca finished Pilgred without waiting for me to pick the hacker kit back up again and Chao grabbed it. Also, because Raluca was gold but low level in mush skills, she also had anonymush - making it obvious that there was an active mush. The forces were gathering to attack Raluca. I couldn't save Hua, but I could attempt to save Ralua and bring us home! So, at day cycle, ran to the front storage (where the grenade was still sitting <em>right there</em>, ate two spores, and attempted to kill Chao and hack us home. I hated attacking Chao - which I guess might be while I failed, and was promptly killed.</p><p>The upside of this is that the team forgave Raluca, and so my martyrdom allowed a mush to go home, and I didn't have to watch another team mate die. It sounds like Raluca made it home undetected. How did the journey end, guys?</p>

                <p>well done freida - Ian here. You played us well indeed. we had no idea Raluca was a mush and so we went home with her on board. The lack of armor did us is and while i slept IRL, the crew decided to go home sadly.<br>kudos to you &amp; your strategy; you very nearly had us yourself, and you engineered a Mush win in the end. it was a fun ship though, the crew really pulled together after your death &amp; looked promising for a little while.</p>
