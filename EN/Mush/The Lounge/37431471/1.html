                <p>This is an After Party thread for this ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3533" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3533</a></p><p>-x-x-x-x-x-x-</p><p><em>Thoughts of Stephen, late at night sitting in his beach chair. The rising tides are slowly taking over the part of the beach where he placed his chair an hour earlier</em> :</p><p>This isn’t the wild party I had planned. Everyone is too busy working to enjoy the triumph of the return home. I suppose the work is needed. The serum we created will need to be produced in large scale and fast if we really want a victory over the mush. Ian and Chun barely spoke of anything else all night. Can you imagine such a nice beach and Ian didn’t even try the waves?</p><p>I hear Chao’s voice loudly ordering people around. He truly became our commander, for which I’m grateful. I can handle him better this way than his previous role of torturer. I’ve never seen such horrible and effective methods. If any mush ever attempt to infiltrate our group again they don’t stand a chance as long as he’s our leader.</p><p>As for the rest of my crew … I can’t believe I think of them as my crew. I hopped aboard with no clue what I was getting myself into, with no connection to anyone, just finding an escape and now I’m surrounded by my crew. Surrounded by my friends?</p><p>Even Raluca, she looked extremely uncomfortable sitting at the table for dinner earlier tonight, but she absolutely wanted to be part of it. She might not enjoy our company, but she still doesn’t want to be without it either. It all too complicated for me. Luckily Janice was sitting next to her often whispering in hushed tones some advice or whatever sorceries a shrink uses.</p><p>Also Eleesha who we tortured to the brink of death for a small but significant mistake she made aboard the daedalus is here now, as part of the group, smiling. I spotted her chatting with Frieda. No-nonsense Frieda, who was ready to kill Eleesha for suspected mushiness after her mistake with the list, is now chatting with her as if they have been friends for years. At least I think Frieda shouting at someone is how she talks to her friends too.</p><p>Gioele is a great host. It seems he slowly starts to trust me a little, as long as I’m far enough away from his daughter at least. I’m glad we forced him to let us use his beach mansion for this party. He raised the toast to Hua. I barely knew the girl, why did I almost shed a tear then??</p><p>And then there is Paola. She looked amazing again tonight. She spend most of the night talking into that weird radio of hers, I listened to her talk most of all. I’m not sure what exactly she was discussing, I must admit I was more interested in hearing her lovely voice than in the exact words she was saying. I don’t think she’ll ever notice me, or take me serious. Even if she never does, I’m happy I helped her survive that terrible and wonderful ship. Ugh I somehow turned into a sentimental old fool in just a few days time. Even just thinking about her now makes me imagine I can hear her voice. Wait, no. I really hear her voice. There she is, walking barefoot through the sand. Maybe I should try one more time to get her to notice me. I’ll go to her take away that radio of hers and force her to really notice me for once. Just the two of us in the moonlight on this beach…</p>

                <p>Hey all! I was your weird, inconsistently RPing Ian. Having a looooot of real life stresses these days, but the ship was sure a haven to kick back and play on, even though I couldn't decide one way to play my personality as, I just did whatever worked for me at the moment, previous behavior disregarded.</p><p>I dunno how many times in speaking I confused Stephen and <span class="tid_strike">Ian</span> err, Gioele. I'm going to leave that initially typed error in, but wow, I really do have some mental block against Gioele now, heh! Course, this wasn't the first ship I was on I had that trouble with... a few ships back I was calling everyone Ian when things got stressed on the ship, at one point trying to tell Ian to leave the room so Ian could hit Ian.</p><p>... It's not drugs, so I blame stress. Early Alzheimer's? Ehh, stress.</p><p>Finola, we caught you because you didn't do enough masquerade. Your first action after mush selection was to walk out of the lab without a word or even checking the terminal (though just checking it would not have been believable cover for being human Finola either) and move straight for a bed.... and when you got there you picked up the soap, then moved out of the dorm and back into it, all without having visibly dropped the soap. I figured you were a mush going on rampage once you had enough AP.... I figured you intended it for as early D2 as possible once you had enough AP to fuel your rampage.</p><p>Roland, your being caught was possibly more random.... I dunno much about how Chao selected you for torture and if you were initially a random check or not... you were actually being pretty effective on the turrets and I didn't especially think you were mush. Then again, Chao was pretty darn awesome, period.</p><p>Eleesha, you were really calm with us, and I thank you for that. A few things happened that ship that was not the best for you; after your torture I guess you were left low health for a good few cycles and on that expo we were preparing, I was super stressed irl and freaking out that you were in Icarus bay without having picked anything up. I think I should have mentored you more, and from early in play; we both might have enjoyed that a lot. And you kept coming back to us, and you kept doing the best you understood how to do for the ship - even when it would have been pretty easy to decide 'Right then. These people are being jerks to me, I'm done with them'. I didn't really start to feel like I understood you and your choices until our PMs where you explained what you thought was going on in the expo - and then you looked like one of my favorite types of players - a new one trying to figure stuff out and play the best possible at every moment. Shame my understanding came about a day from the ship's end, and we couldn't talk more. I'd have enjoyed it and I think you might have too.</p><p>Hua, you were another new player, and one easier to recognize! A light went out on our ship when we lost you to getting lost on the expo, and it was not only because you were our sole pilot.</p><p>To me, Stephen and Janice were this ship's backbone. But I enjoyed all of you, save Jin, who was a random pill popping non-communicating scary presence who sure didn't stay idle but didn't do anything else I could tell.</p>

You made me really love this ship with you erratic RPing, kindness towards new comers, and all around willingness to help. You were such a pleasure. You too Stephen, you were such a fun character, and that first chat we had about Mush hunting really shaped the game I believe. Again, sorry I stole the glory from your kill. Also a big apology to Eleesha as I was definitely on the "pro-death" list for you. Oops. Sorry.</p><p>I'm very sad I missed the end of the ship. Stupid having to sleep IRL. When I left, I had no idea we planned to leave. Though it made sense, we were gradually dying through lack of pilot and techs. Wish we could have made it longer!</p>

                <p>Roland's torture wasn't totally random. He got dirty from eating, which he reported. When I checked my kitchen supplies later I noticed that he was still dirty in the refectory and that he had moved around after being dirty without going straight for the shower. I reported it thinking it wasn't a very big deal, but something the mush hunters should know nevertheless. Chao decided that it was suspicious enough and went for a torture session. Roland got a little unlucky as it turned out that his moving around and staying dirty in refectory wasn't where he did anything wrong, it was before that he apparently did some sabotage attempts that showed up through the torture.</p><p>End of the ship came rather sudden yes. I just told Chao he could go sleep as we should be good with after our movement only 4 hunters remaining, but then when we arrived 15 extra hunters joined that group and put us at 19 hunters. So we needed to hack the command terminal or sure, we could have moved with 1 fuel but that would have put us at 9/10 hunters which still hurts and would have forced us to hack the terminal again, such a waste of ap and useless risks that just returning home was the better idea.</p>
