Though Hua my partner was also just staying in Lab being afraid of skill questions - I suppose cause of lags.<br>The game started on Day2, noone was idling around so I infected Nexus shelf, made 2 extra spores and went to collect AP.<br>On Day 3 I found that Janice got it and staying with Derek in Nexus. And here about my mistake - I knew that you can spike in a room with people but didn't know you can't do it with shelf - tried to find smth about it but failed. So I came there and <em>infected shelf and saw a red log about it</em>... Was clear I wouldn't leave for long <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":tid_nooo:" class="tid_ico">. So I decided to make a morale kill - kill some and then move to Janice. First I infected Derek cause it was the easiest way to help Hua make a partner. I took some weapon and killed Chun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">. Then I found Jin with Ian <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">. So I killed Stephen cause he had 6th level skill plus tech <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt=":tid_cool:" class="tid_ico">. Kicked a little Terrence, left my trakie somewhere and jumped to Janice. Found out she had 4 morale and quite a lot AP. Right after that I took shrink skill hoping they would need to choose between me and Derek. But in a couple of minutes came Roland and told all I have no skills <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> - bug? Well, so he started killing me - I ran away to get blaster I left somewhere before... and killed chasing me Roland with a headshot <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/wink2.png" alt=":tid_wink:" class="tid_ico">. I found that I still have some ap and had a knife from Roland. If I knew Raluca was so low on morale already would be nice to kill Terrence (last tech in that case). But anyway they didn't live to the moment they needed pilgred as I understood... Not much people were left without Ian in room <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">. So I decided to kill Paola and hide a little that fact - Paola was quite active and I didn't want them to get day 5 connect. I turned Bios to not noting deaths, food destruction, allowed piloting and turned priority off. Went to the bridge... and killed Paola <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":tid_innocent:" class="tid_ico">. Actually killing was never so easy before. Well, then 1 took extinguisher (and misclicked another one) - was in a hurry cause online people wanted to kill me and took off (another mistake that didn't matter - took patrol instead of passiphae - didn't calculate AP right). Oh and hid knife for Hua. After I took off found out only 1 ext with me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> - so asked Hua to hide second one (and she did) - noone would have noticed. Then they moved away - wasn't bad for me cause this last part of hasty plan - I wanted to leave them without extinguishers. Raluca died on cycle change cause of morale loss.</p><p>And now I see something interesting happened after that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">. I don't see 3rd mush. Most did die of morale loss but also I see that some people started killing each other. What was that about? And I didn't get Jin's screams about lame mush play. For me it looks like quite a nice way to sabotage the ship in whole.</p>
