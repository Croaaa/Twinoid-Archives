This started as an incredibly disfunctional (but competant) ship. I was Terrence, and these are my cliffnotes of the past 15 days. Apologies is some of my memories are hazy.</p><p>Off the bat we had issues. While it became very apparant that most of our crew was competant, a streak of beginners making beginner mistakes and paranoia ran through us. Stephen immediately started by cooking food. Jin Su had to speak through google translator to communicate. Ian got dirty from taking care of the plants and Gioele was constantly paranoid (and I don't just mean his skill). However our core problem, was Derek.</p><p>Derek started the game by beating the snot out of Paola - for no reason. Paola was active, talkative and started doing good work on comms, more than can be said for 80% of Paolas these days. Derek beat her half to death, then moved to a dorm and started working over Janice. All without saying a word. Vital AP had to be wasted putting him down and in the end he turned out to be a human, just another of a long list of griefers.</p><p>Around this time I was invited to a mush hunt (caught a psychological illness from the Derek Debacle). The next few days, being on the inside made me uneasy. I'm always glad to be in the mush hunt thread, but it highlighted just how...careless it was. Paola was the initiator and had nothing to prove her as human (something that personally put me on edge for several days, and something I voiced in another, secondary mush hunt). People started getting invited on basis such as chun saying "I trust them" and nothing else. I started to question Chunnie's judgment as the hunt swelled. Our paranoid gio and newbies were all suspects, although I mostly defended them. Stephen was either very new, or a master manipulator at playing the beginner and I believed the former, while Gioele was a bit <em>too</em> paranoid. If he was mush he would have eased back on making himself such a target. Other ship functions were working smoothly, research was initiall slow but neron upgrades were advancing well, hunters were kept at bay by a <em>fantastic</em> pilot team and comms/scanning was coming along smoothly. The hunt was where we were at our weakest. But then the Mush made a mistake.</p><p>Ian was a good botanist. He was talkative and clearly had played before. I could forgive him getting dirty when he took care of the plants, once. "haha silly me I forgot the apron while eating" is not something I can buy however. I wasn't the only one that jumped at this. We knew he was mush for a day before we moved on him, trying to figure the best usage of AP. In the end I think it was roland(?) who did him in, proving that as wacked out and paranoid as our group was, we could still sniff out Mushy BS. One down, how many to go?</p><p>We had built a mycoscanner and were steadily discovering a few of us had multiple spores. Kuan Ti and myself had 2 each, and there were few places both of us could have gotten them (assuming KT was human, which was another cause for debate). Ironically I believe Janice was the greatest suspect at this point due to her work in the Nexus. Gioele had been proven by this stage as well as a few others and a second mush hunt was opened which split attentions somewhat. Thankfully the other mush sort of...gave up.</p><p>Andie tried going out with a bang, literally. A series of grenades opened on Chun and Stephen ultimately lead to us loosing our good chef. His final words as you can read in the link above only make the loss even more hard to take. He was a beginner, but one of those rare ones who exihibited the desire to learn and improve. Sad that had he lived he likely could have seen Eden. Andie's attack ultimately failed at killing Chun, however, and Andie was swiftly put down. This was roughly Day 6.</p><p>What followed was several days of expansive research and upgrades. The cure was rushed and chun stealthily applied it to eleesha since we, being paranoid, assumed she may be infected and lying about the list being unprinted. No, our mush issues were solved. We had 12 Crew members left.</p><p>We reached Eden with 8.</p><p>Jin Su died shortly after during an expedition I believe, he joined in with fairly low health. Still sad to see him go, he was more active than Jins often are, and his bizarre google-speak became endearing. Raluca, despite being talkative and active the first week, went dead silent after the ship was under control. I believe she suffered from Space Boredom. We sold her off rightfully. Our other two deaths hit us a bit harder.</p><p>We had decided to scan out for starmap pieces to Eden. Personally I still didn't think we'd make it. I had been to Eden once before, with an incredible crew. And while this crew was solid, I didn't think we could survive the stretch in days 12-20 with constant fires and the ship actively trying to kill you each cycle. I didn't account for sheer dumb luck. We had several scanners, efficient ap conservation/coffee usage and two sofas. I believe it was after we found the first starmap piece when Frieda and Chun Died.</p><p>Steel Platting and room shakings did them in. Frieda went first, followed by Chun (after the second star map I think?). This gimped our scanning and instantly put us in a slight morale crisis - especially since around this time Janice started complaining of low morale. Fires and breakings were starting to ravage the ship. We had, at any given time, only half our patrollers working. Half the doors were broken and every cycle we had to heal.</p><p>We had the plasma shield, good pilots, and pilgred up. We had an excellent botany plan and efficient usage of extinguishers. But that can only do so much, especially as more breakings and fires were happening. Then we found it. North 5. 13 zones. One cristallite. 44% chance with Janice for our star map piece. If we didn't get it on this, I highly doubt we would have made it to another planet (if we found one!) and likely would had to of gone home. During the Expo we lost Eleesha. Eleesha had been doing great on fires and had recieved the cure (even though she never was told!), we couldn't leave her behind in this critical time. We got the Star Map but a second expo had to be launched.</p><p>We found her. With Eleesha at 1HP we calculator rushed, calculated the location and hacked our way to Eden. On day 15 Hua, Janice, Roland, Kuan Ti, Eleesha, Gioele, Paola and myself made it to Eden.</p><p>I recommended that our first city be dubbed Chunopolis in the name of our lost Last Hope. In retrospect, our crew had the competance to likely handle much more than we did. We had a good deal of luck but even more so an excellent crew. I'll add some final thoughts on each surviving member in another post. I just want to close with this excellent line from Hua and KT:</p><p>Hua : <br>Thanks...if me and you had a baby we could call it Huan Ki.<br>Kuan Ti : <br>Maybe later.</p>

                <p>Kuan Ti: I really don't recall you speaking much. I do know you were all over the place - I'd wake up to see a list of issues and things needing fixed only to see you either had dealt with them or had dragged the drone along to deal with it - on top of doing the scanning thing. I like playing a Technician Role but you and Eleesha I think trivialized alot of our issues. It's always the backroom heroes that keep a ship going when it should have died off days ago, you did great.</p><p>Eleesha: Surprise! We used the cure on you. I told you we'd get you to Eden. I'm glad they went back for you, you were on top of those repairs and fires - like KT I think you helped big time in keeping the ship together as long as it did. I'm not used to seeing equipment alerts, only to see someone else took care of it. First thing we're building on Sol is a Hospital, you barely made it!</p><p>Gioele: You were paranoid in the beginning, we all were, but you were a special brand. After the mush hunt though I was impressed at how well you got things together. I think there may have been a period commander switched and you went inactive(?) but you came back and maintained a solid leadership role throughout. I see a lot of commanders rarely on or on at weird times but we never really had issues jumping - that alone makes you better than 95% of the commanders these days. Not only that, but you were a solid leader when it came down to it.</p><p>Paola: A comms officer that actually did messages! I love Paola, people don't realize how AP intensive or high stress it can be. My other Eden ship, long ago, I was Paola. You were on point for bases, upgrades and damn near everything. I was a bit leery when you started the mushhunt with Chun while having nothing backing you, but I'm glad that feeling subsided. You were a great asset and an example of what a Paola should be.</p><p>Janice: Had andie not acted when he did, I likely would have pushed to kill you, simply because you were at the wrong place in the wrong time. I thought our spores (KT and myself) were from you. Had I done that we would not have made it to Eden. Your diplomat is what gave us this victory while your morale top ups kept us all sane. You were very active and always right there when we needed a bit of a boost. I don't know how new or experienced you are, but you were perfect.</p><p><strong>PILOT SQUAD</strong><br><em>OH YEAH</em></p><p>Let's real talk and ignore that traitor andie.</p><p>You guys were fantastic. I haven't been on a ship with three active, experienced pilots. I think even without plasma shield, hunters would rarely if ever be a problem. As inefficient as it was, it did get funny launching only to find out Hua wiped out that hunter batch 22 seconds before. Roland, you were always there to lead an expo, shoot a mush or clear out some hunters. Hell, you even took out a D1000. Do you ever sleep? You are a true space cowboy.</p><p>Miss Hua - What can I say? I often talk about how good people are in roles, but I think that would be unfair in this circumstance. You, as a person, are an incredible crew member. I don't mean you are a great Hua. I mean that, no matter what role, I would want you on every future ship of mine. Active, Helpful, Funny, Efficient, and maybe a bit child-obsessed - you set the bar not only for what a Hua should be, but for what a crew member should be. The entire crew made this ship successful, but you, personally, made it enjoyable over all else. Thank you.</p>

                <p>Yesss! We made it! I was Hua. Good write up JerkSteve. It was nice to recap all the events that went down.</p><p>Kuan Ti and Eleehsa made a silent but effective team at dealing with all the mishaps aboard the Daedalus. I would refresh at cycle change to see a list of bad Neron Reports only to refresh again to see that they were taken care of.</p><p>I'm not used to having other active pilots on board with me. We were actually stumbling over each other when it was time to kill hunters. And Roland you beast, how many Asteroids and D1000s did you take down?</p><p>I hope everyone realizes what a huge play it was to have Janice upgrade and take the Diplomat skill. While there were a lot of things that got us to Eden I believe this was the turning point of the game and made me realize we could make it to Eden. With out a diplomat, exploring is a nightmare. Weapons and fighting never work out the way you want them to. Avoiding conflict is the most efficient way. Giolele and I were about 1 cycle away from making the white flag. Just in time Janice! Taking that skill wasn't the only thing you had going for you though, you were active and helpful and asked question when you weren't sure of something (those are the best qualities of a good crew mate).</p><p>Paola, Frieda, Chun, Gioele. You guys held down the front of the ship like pros. And when Kuan-Ti came up to help after the demise of Chun and Frieda the ball kept rolling. Without a solid Astro/Research Team ships go no where. Simple as that.</p><p>As far as the Mush hunt goes I wish I could have been involved in that more but I wasn't cleared as human yet so it makes since that I wasn't. To be honest, I was the one who convinced Chun to give Eleesha the cure because I am forever paranoid of Eleesha. In retrospect I thought to myself that I shouldn't have done that because we lost the potential Glory of returning to Sol without the Serum....but we went to Eden so no harm! This is all because I was on a ship that had a very organized Mush team. They had switched bodies and used anonymous in such a way that they had the Human crew convinced that all the Mush were dead. And the nail in the coffin was when our Eleesha had told us that she was unable to print the list. "Yay! Lets go home!"... Well It turns out that Eleesha was Mush as well as three other of the crew. It was pretty embarrassing. That was the last time I was human and returned to Sol with Mush on board.</p><p>As far as the inactives go...I always wonder how easy this game would be if the entire crew remained active. But then again I wonder if everybody stayed active would the game be as suspenseful and therefore as fun?</p><p>If I left anyone important out sorry!<br>Hua Out! ( I gotta go feed Huan Ki..)</p>

                <p>So here's how everything went down from my perspective:</p><p><strong>Bad Luck Beginning (Actually Not)</strong> <strong><em>(D1-D2)</em></strong><br>My expectations for this ship were pretty low, but the reason for that wasn't the ship itself. The thing was... a few days before this journey started, I was trying to participate in a group jump. First time doing so, all excited, but somehow I ended up missing it. So I got this ship instead. I tried not to let that influence my way of playing, but... yeah, I was kind of disappointed. <br>Of course being attacked by a griefer right at the start didn't help either. I considered myself "kinda lucky" to have survived that, but it might have not bothered me all that much if I hadn't.</p><p>Now, in retrospect, I can say: I'm so <em>very </em>lucky! And so very glad that I could be part of this ship! Not just because of our wonderful end result, but also because I feel like we were one of these crews which made a huuuge improvement as time went on. As Terrence said, we started out disfunctional... and ended awesome.</p><p><strong>Stumbling into the Action</strong> <strong><em>(D2-D6)</em></strong><br>Luckily, shortly after that griefer incident something else occured, and that something managed to spark my interest in the game and also got me back into my usual form. <em> I witnessed a slimetrapping!</em> ...nah, of course I didn't. No one ever uses slimetraps. What I actually witnessed was Frieda catching a fungal infection due to a starting spore. <br>But it took some time for Frieda to come online and confirm that, and in the meantime I went full paranoid and initiated a mush hunt channel, consisting of Frieda (the supposed slimetrap victim), Terrence (confirmed human), Chun (well, Chun) and me. <br>In the end Frieda cleared up the whole situation before we took any consequences, but the channel persisted and grew. <br>What was a bit worrisome was the way the channel grew – it seemed too easy to gain Chun's trust. In the end, her intuition was right, but it could have backfired. I don't want to complain too much though, for me it was great being granted that trust. Playing Paola, I had a hard time getting logs of anything that was not located between the bridge and the kitchen, so I was thankful for any kind of information I could get.</p><p>Unfortunately it still was not enough to do anything, so we took our sweet time with acting.</p><p>Eventually, however, Ian made it somewhat easy for us by making these apron "mistakes". A green thumb Ian just can't get away with that twice. (Now, if he had not picked his skills pre-mush... that would have made the matter slightly more difficult! But I'm not complaining. Thanks for these extra pots by the way. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>Andie managed to completely stay under our radar until his rampage. Kinda makes one wonder why he rampaged then - the chances of destroying us with that were nil. But I guess he just really, really did not want to get cured. And with the mycoscanner and the bacteria done, there was not much else he could have done I guess. I respect that, but it truly was a pity that the victim of all that was Stephen. Terrence already said it, but it has to be repeated: <em>Stephen, you were great!</em> Really missed you!</p><p>With Andie's death, we were mush-free at D5 I believe. Not a very fast hunt, and a kind of dirty one. So I too wanted to play it safe and let Eleesha be injected with the cure. Hua - you were not the only one trying to convince Chun to do that. Far from it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>Also, Eleesha did know about it. After Chun finally used the cure, I invited Eleesha to the channel, wanting to clear up the situation... but it didn't really have the effect I was hoping for. Instead, both Eleesha and Chun left the channel before I could really explain anything, fed up with my paranoia I suppose. Sorry. But on a ship like this, it wouldn't have surprised me if a defaced dorm or something of that sort got overlooked. The possibility of Eleesha being mush existed, especially since we took so long to kill any mush. It was not until the serum was "wasted" that we could move on.</p><p><strong>Dreaming of Eden &amp; Unlucky Days (Really, this time)</strong><strong><em> (D6-D10)</em></strong><br>So despite the suboptimal mush hunt, we were in a pretty good situation. A growing bumpjunkin farm, useful magebooks &amp; projects, and although the activity on board still was not the best, we had a lot of gold players and all the skills needed (just lacked a diplo and a biologist, but Janice and I later managed to get that covered as well. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">) Eden, we are coming!</p><p>Or maybe not? The following days were difficult. We scanned more planets than in any other period of the journey, and yet there was not a single good one among them. What made things worse was that both Raluca and Frieda went inactive all of sudden.</p><p>The idea of giving up was there. In the public discussions.... and in my head as well, although I never admitted that and always tried to keep everyone going. Really had conflicted feelings there. With the help of some general announcements, I attempted to push everyone in what I thought to be the right direction. But I was very, very unsure about that direction. Despite that, eventually it looked like I sort of became the figureheard of the let's-keep-going-faction, a position which I really did not plan on taking. <br>It would be easy for me to say something like <em>"Hey, look! Eden, just as I told you! I knew we would make it!"</em> - but that just wasn't what I really was feeling. People's concerns were valid, and the price for Eden later turned out to be high indeed.</p><p>Well, for the moment, days went by without much happening. No planets, no expos, no action. However, the crew massively improved despite that lack of luck. Everyone - even the most pessimistic - gave it their best and handled the new challenges very well. Fires were always taken care of perfectly. And that is saying something considering how many of these fires we had! <br>And although I said "everyone", I want to mention two people seperately:<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> Janice! I remember how she gave out random, inefficient hugs in the beginning of the game. And as time went on, she improved considerably when it came to AP efficiency and communication. Oh, and of course becoming a diplomat was a nice move as well. <br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hua.png" alt=":mush_hua_50:" class="tid_ico"> Hua! I think Hua found the perfect balance between playing in a fun way and playing in an efficient way. Sometimes I feel like it's hard to combine these two, but Hua's messages were always fun to read and at the same time got us moving forward without creating any room for misinterpretation. She also did some great garden work which really helped us immensely. Really was a joy to play with you!</p><p><strong>Dream's Revival</strong> <strong><em>(D11-D15)</em></strong><br>It took quite some time, but then we finally got our luck back. One starmap D11, the second starmap D12. Reach Eden or die trying became our new motto, and... well, we all know which of these two endings we got.</p><p>With one sad exception: Chun died shortly after we found the second starmap, and her death hit me pretty hard. So I'm very glad to hear from you again, Chun! And I'm glad that you seem to be not too sad about your death. Really a shame you did not make it to the end. But at least you now have a city named after you! So in some way, you not only made it to Eden, you have also become immortal. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>tl;dr: </strong> Great voyage, great team, thanks everyone! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>
