Honestly, with that many active people, I hoped one would make a thread about it, as it's always me who writes the same tropes down. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The ship awakened and quickly dispatched the two mushes (it had to been before day 5). Not much stood in the way of Eden, as on day 10 we had most Projects (most good ones!) done, all relevant researches done, 3 upgraded drones and a mostly active crew. Sadly, it didn't add up for 3 starmap fragments.</p><p>For the crew, we had good guys here, some that are probably forum goers, hope you'll find this. Anyone who died of not stupid causes like starvation (<em>hOW CAN YOU FORGET MUSH, HOOOW CHUN?</em><img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico">) did a good job.<br>Stephen pushed us to the limit (Walk along the razor's edge....dun dun dun, insert lyrics here<img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">), and a Mankarog has eaten our dear Paola. To this day, a bright pink fluff of hair is wedged between it's teeth.<br>Sadly, after day15, it all started falling apart, as usual: Steel plating, panic attacks, and OH GOD THE FIRES, FIRES EVERYWHERE. BURNING BRIGHT LIKE MY LOVE FOR JANICE! NO EXTINGUISHER MAY STAND IN OUR WAY! (or court paper for that matter. It just burns away.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/keepcool.png" alt=":K" class="tid_ico">)</p><br><p>A few things were weird though.<br>On the pilot side, we had enough people to take care of them, yet even on early days I remember them barely keeping up. Could have just been my outside perspective, just found it strange, but to those active and salvaging, gratz to you.<br>Jin...I don't understand you. I have no idea what we did or what you did, but the several dropped lines of hostility in the sea of silence is a no-go.<br>Eleesha: You were..alive? I'm honestly suprised, rarely saw you in chat, just teleporting to several rooms, and falling inactive sometimes. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Well this is an uneventful story I have written. Guess I should take my morning tea now to wake up.</p><p>I did notice that for Terrence, you really do need gold. I have taken Technician and Drone Expert, and wow I was lackluster. After finishing projects, I rarely had anything to do, then after day15, there was just too many to fix/extinguish. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>3 upgraded drones however do bring a lot of hidden power to the ship, but I felt that taking pilot would have been more usefull, especially since after pilgred Raluca alone can easily maintain a ship. Being a technician that has a harder time moving around is just cruel. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hey, Terrence! I was your lovely comms officer-turned-astrophysicist <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/paola.png" alt=":mush_paola_50:" class="tid_ico"> Paola.</p><p>This ship probably had things the best "under control" that I've ever been on. The poor Mush were easily sniffed out and destroyed with no human casualties aside from a human Gioele griefer (who made the weakest attempt at sabotage I've ever seen). Most everyone stayed at least semi-active for a long time, and the ones that fell inactive died pretty quickly to plates or starvation, with the exception of Chun, Eleesha, and Frieda, who would drop off the radar and then suddenly have a burst of useful activity. We had active pilots, a Janice who managed to be everywhere she was needed with the Medikit or a hug, teams that managed to both finish NERON projects and venture into glory research, and a Heat Lamps garden full of Jumpkins that never saw a fire... at least not while I was alive. The biggest yield I saw was 18 jumpkins!</p><p>The thing that stood in the way of Eden was just finding the starmap fragments, which came excruciatingly slow. The first I think we found in a cavern while we were there for something else, and the next two Cristalite zones (neither of which I actually found) were Mush traps. I scanned tirelessly and never saw a single Cristalite zone on my terminal. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> I imagine that's why Stephen kept eating all the jumpkins to scan, which I was resisting the temptation to do for a reason. Ended up giving him a piece of my mind over it because of the AP waste, but the irritating thing was that like my magic touch for reestablishing the Sol connection, his grubby non-Astro hands had a magic touch for finding Cristalite planets. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>When we got the Cristalite/Mankarog planet, it was day 17 and we decided to risk it, knowing the fires and breakages would only get worse. So we piled into the Icarus and... proceeded to find every other zone first. It was amazing how dramatically it unfolded. Finally there were two left: the Cristalite and the Mankarog. Success! We found a starmap! Now to cross our fingers. Maybe the Mankarogs will make us abandon the already good-as-finished expo. Or maybe, I thought cheekily, we'll find an artifact and it'll be the third starmap. Unfortunately, I got smashed instead. But at least it wasn't our Diplomat Janice, or that might have been game over for the crew right there.</p><p>I thought you guys had a solid chance, and I'm sorry to hear the ship's issues finally became insurmountable. We were so close, and I enjoyed flying with you all. After having a run of rather terrible ships, this one has been part of a trend of pretty great ones. So thanks for that. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

Had great projects: almost everything related to the garden, all Astro- and both fire projects. GPU, AC, and so on. However not a single pilot-project. Our pilots did great though until day 15 space was clear almost all the time, hull and shield almost at 100%, but then we focussed just on finding more Cristalite fragments. We wouldn't have lasted much longer than D20C1. It was pretty close in the end.</p><p>I'm a bit sad, we didn't reach Eden, out of all my ship this is possibly the one, which deserved it the most. <br>But hey... you didn't miss anything, Kobb.

                <p>Oh, just found out about this thread. <br>Stephen here. Thanks for your dedication, guys! I've never gone so far before - which makes it even more frustrating that we couldn't find Eden.<br>By the way, in my whole ship history I've never seen a person NOT eaten by a mankarog. That's why I keep insisting to going to these zones - I just can't believe it'll happen again with such a low chance, and then it does (at the same time try repairing something with 44% probability, you'll almost never succeed from the first try <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">).<br>And sorry for eating those jumpkins.
