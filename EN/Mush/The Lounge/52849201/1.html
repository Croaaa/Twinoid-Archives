                <p>Janice here. So the little mess I did failed to stop you from reaching Sol? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"><br>Sadly I couldn't do much as - although I was the first to wake up after selection - the extra cameras prevented any further conversion and the only persons in unprotected rooms were Raluca(can't just go there with an active Ellesha... though turned inactive pretty soon) and Hua, who already was Mush. Yay...<br>So did a little scouting and found starting spores on Frieda and Gioele - bummer...<br>The mage book was useless(Botanist) and Mush Sample was in a storage, so i couldn't even bother to hide it without revealing myself. (Yay...) Extracted spores and went back to BD secretly showering. As a Diplomat I was expected to participate in the upcoming expedition, which revealed mymiserable HP status and already raised suspicion. I also tried to stick 2 spores on Roland picking Infector and after I did the first one, he left for Jin Su just that moment. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"><br>Fortunately Hua somehow managed to convert him with 2 traps. While research progressed I became a lot more suspicious due to lack of AP and impending morale issues and Chun probably knew for certain I was Mush as she didn't tell me the property of the pills when asked. Hua more or less flew under the rader by being almost inactive. D5C6 Chun finished the Natamy, shot me 3 times and gloriously missed all. Then she went back to Medlab I guess. As I could assume my cover was blown and she came at me with the intent to kill(at least I hope so... Natamy tests are evil!) I decided to... wait. <br>This whole incident made 1 thing apparent: Chun was pretty incompetent. She rushed to me the moment the Natamy was finished without any kind of backup. Hell, I bet she didn't tell anyone that I was shot. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Anyway, I just took my time and lay low until the end of C8. 2 spores extract, camera removed. Stephen and Terrence screaming "Mush!" with the former already been converted. And Ceasefire. During the Ceasefire Roland sticked a 2nd spore on Gioele in BD. <br>Sadly Stephen wasn't aroun't D6C4 to call a 2nd Ceasefire and Terrence was already lurking in AD to... kill. Raluca said she was ready to genius the cure in public to rfs me to save everyone's morale(or rather just her own...) I rushed to the Nexus and tempered with the BIOS settings(Research blocked and no death messages basically) while Terrence killed Roland. Back to AD to hit Terrence a bit, which pretty much failed and then trying to escape as I missed a lot and he was going for me. But he killed me. I watched a bit and saw Gioele being killed by Derek and that's where it ends for me... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>The aftermath must've been quite a mess with another human(Derek) killed and 4 morale deaths. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>
