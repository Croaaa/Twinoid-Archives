I had such a great time with our little Mush family and with the humans that, sadly, we couldn't convert.</p><p>The ship had quite a good start before mush selection, with a small but active crew. There were only a handful of people awake in the first two days, but we already had two pilots, a shrink, two techs, and everyone was quite talkative apart from a few zombies. The rest of the crew was nice and active too, and the game started smoothly.</p><p>Mush selection occurred on D3C8, and I became alpha mush with Ian. Not a great set-up, although we could both go on expos and use it as an excuse to get dirty, but the first planet had several forests and swamps, which made us reluctant to go. Fortunately, human Eleesha, the last crewmember awake, picked up the apron immediately and forgot to drop it. That was the perfect opportunity for Ian, who got dirty taking care of plants and soon after converted Finola, who was sleeping in medlab.</p><p>Eleesha eventually dropped the apron, but for some reason picked it up again without doing anything else. While complaining loudly and asking for her death, we jumped at the chance again to get dirty eating. We had quite a fright when I walked into CC right when Finola was extracting a spore, and she had to erased the logs. We crossed our fingers, and luckily no one noticed. Finola waited in IB for the expo team to come back, ready to heal them... and to double-spike Jin Su. I finished his conversion when he came to the bridge to leave the planet.</p><p>The next day, we tried to plan our next move. We were hoping to convert the remaining active humans, but at some point during the day we realized that ASG had been completed. We eventually decided to convert Janice and Raluca in AD. By chance, both of them were active at the right moment, and although Janice had time to warn Terrence and Chun that the dorm logs had been erased, they both picked Anonymush almost immediately. Finola then declared a ceasefire in the dorm and all the mushlings had a cosy little reunion there. At day change, we converted Stephen (quite openly, because none of the mush present could take anonymush or had AP to erase the BD logs) and tried to kill Chun. She survived a grenade, shots and punches from three mush including Solid Stephen, and finally succumbed to starvation the next cycle.</p><p>We would have liked to convert the two remaining active humans, Paola and Terrence, but again none of the mush online at the time had the ability to spike again, and we wouldn't have had enough spores anyway. We knew they had AP and could kill some of us, so we decided to kill them, before killing the last inactives.</p><p>Ian and Finola, I really had fun playing with you. It's so great to have nice, active partners! Jin Su was also a nice addition to our team, and so were Janice and Stephen (don't apologize for not being as active as you would have liked, RL comes first, and you helped as much as you could). So thank you all for a fun ship!</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/12632" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/12632</a> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Janice reporting in! I'll admit it was a great shock to get converted, let's see who the other mush are..... there are *how* many!? If my schedule would permit it we could have gotten those last few conversions, but sadly I was converted as I was packing up to go on vacation for the weekend, so the best I could do is grab Mycellium Spirit for the cause and call in a ceasefire to protect my comrades.</p><p>It was definitely a fun ship to take part in!</p>
