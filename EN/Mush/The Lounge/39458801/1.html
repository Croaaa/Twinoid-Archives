This game we had quite a few inactives but unfortunately they were all in generalist roles. Had a great active team of<strong> Derek, Eleesha, Ian, and Stephen</strong> (oh and me) as the core. <strong>Hua</strong> did quite a lot of work as well but she had some early communication problems.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> was super infrequent which caused us a ton of damage, but he did do some good work here and there. Same for <strong>Terrence</strong> who apparently <em>DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO READ PRIVATE MESSAGES!!!</em> <strong> Chun</strong> was around at least once a day which also caused us some problems but she ultimately SAVED THE DAY so I forgive her!<strong> Janice</strong> did stand in a dorm giving morale and did some NERON in the beginning but ultimately went inactive.</p><p>Anyway, off to a great start with <strong>Paola, Gioele, and Kuan Ti</strong> going inactive immediately. <strong>Roland </strong>only had Sprinter and spent most of the time asking what to do (which we told him) and then wasting his AP shooting in turrets. He was ultimately killed just in case he was a Mush but turned out to be human.</p><p><strong>Frieda</strong> and<strong> Andie </strong>were our Mush. <strong> Andie</strong> started off sounding active (and fighting with<strong> Ian</strong>) but immediately after Mush selection went inactive which was suspicious. <strong>Derek</strong> killed her after a few days and one Mush down! <strong>Frieda</strong> did pretty well hiding. She manage to spike the cat (for some reason people dragged the cat all over the ship in the first day... still don't know why) but otherwise stayed on the bridge sofa teasing out some planets.</p><p>Our super actives were really helpful though <strong>Eleesha</strong> had to stop mush hunting to do comms after <strong>Paola</strong> died of natural falling ceiling causes. It didn't matter much with an inactive <strong>Andie</strong> and a stuck on the bridge<strong> Frieda</strong> anyway.</p><p>Immediately we had Hunter problems because<strong> JS</strong> was semi-infrequent and<strong> Roland</strong> was useless. <strong>Hua</strong> did a ton of heavy lifting and we did manage to collect scrap here and there. We finally got an expedition but had a terrible time organizing. Ultimately <strong>Eleesha</strong> and<strong> Ian</strong> guarded the front corridor (again couldn't get a hold of <strong>Jin Su</strong>) while <strong>Frieda</strong> took <strong>Derek</strong> and <strong>Stephen</strong> on the expo. Immediately<strong> Derek</strong> noticed <strong>Frieda</strong> only had 9 health and we should have been more suspicious of that (she had no damages as far as we could tell) and she almost died. Basically the expedition went about as bad as it could but we did manage to get the O2 (everything else failed). That was also suspicious.</p><p>We let it slide because she was our only astro but <strong>Derek</strong> and <strong>Stephen</strong> did get confirmed human. <strong>Eleesha</strong> also food tested due to emergencies, <strong>Jin Su </strong>woke up and food tested without prompt which was good because we were getting suspicious. <strong> Terrence</strong> got Crabism from <strong>Derek</strong> killing Janice later and the confirmed were sprouting like flies. I hadn't been confirmed yet but my participation and helpfulness put me on the trusted chat early.</p><p>Then we get another expo to go on to Intelligent Life and Cristalite and while we are waiting on a pilot, some of us leave IB for cycle change. THEN <strong>Hua </strong>randomly runs in and starts the Expo with just her and <strong>Derek</strong> I think and suddenly Mush alarms go off again. Luckily before we decide to kill her she got an illness on the trip.</p><p>Ultimately after various tests the Mush was obviously <strong>Frieda</strong> and we were trying to decide if we could secretly rush the cure. Without a single Biologist the timing just wasn't right. We hit Day 10 and as usual the crap hit the fan. Fires, 24 Hunters, broken stuff. Everyone was running around except Jin Su was inactive as usual and <strong>Chun</strong> barely logged in and <strong><em>never dropped the Hacker Kit </em></strong>despite us pleading several times over several cycles.</p><p>Finally we got down to ONE HULL with 23 Hunters. We decided that we weren't going to get the serum so it was decided to kill <strong>Frieda</strong>, finish PILGRED (it was at 70% and I had 2 free points) and just jet off to Sol. Unfortunately <strong>Stephen</strong> was unable to kill <strong>Frieda</strong> and she woke up suddenly, grabbing a few items and launching in the Pasiphae. ALSO we had researched Magnetic Return and nobody was sure if we just went to Sol would<strong> Frieda</strong> get picked up.</p><p>So we needed a NERON admin to turn off the Mag Net and <strong>Terrence</strong> was not there. We all sat around for a cycle trying to figure out what to do, trying to wake up <strong>Chun, JS, and/or Terrence</strong>. <strong>Terrence</strong> wakes up, <strong><em>makes SOME HULL REPAIRS, cheers Chun to hack the command console publically, then goes AFK again. I was SO ANGRY. </em></strong></p><p>Luckily <strong>Chun</strong> finally did wake up and made a master play. Despite searching for rations and stuff so <strong>Eleesha</strong> could hack the BIOS terminal we couldn't come up with a play <strong>(JS </strong>had been AFK for almost a day at this point). Nearing the end and with<strong> Frieda</strong> taunting us the whole time, <strong>Chun</strong> pulled a master play by hacking the BIO Terminal, then running up and hacking the command console and getting us home.</p><p>All in all a decent ship. Our actives were VERY active but they were all the generalists and we really needed a researcher (Ian was only Botanist). Our NERON was great but we didn't get Plasma Shield until the bitter end when it was too late. I also wasted ~15 AP trying to dismantle that damn Lizaro Jungle to get another sofa (I failed a 56% and 68% chance to dismantle, and it costs 3 AP!?)</p><p>Thanks again for all the actives, you made it fun. I wish we could have made the serum but we just had too many inactives and semi-actives in critical roles.</p><p>Oh and<strong> Ian</strong> I was never mad at you, just joking. For those of you curious,<strong> Ian </strong>was actually in my previous nightmare ship as Mush Ian. The Mush on that ship didn't even have to do anything, the humans got into fights and killed each other or were inactive. That was a sad ship. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hello, Ian here. When i got here, the game was already over and i couldn't believe that we didn't kill Frieda!? <br>I mean, we killed other people so fast for nothing, doesn't make sense really. This time i wanted you to kill, Derek <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway, i think we can agree that Frieda was a bad mush, doing nothing but helping us the whole game. If i wasn't Ian i would have killed her when we found out, but you guys wanted to use the Serum so i agreed. We needed someone to search planets so it made some sense to keep her alive.</p><p>The other worst character in my opinion was Chun. I was going to report Chun in the end screen but forgot to do it. She logged in quite often and yet refused to participate/reply to any conversation while also holding the kit and the medlab bed all the time, not allowing us to do what was needed. <br>But right before the ship was about to be destroyed she was quite active and replying with "lolz" to the mush. If there is any way to still report her i would like to know.</p><p>Everyone else was good in general, specially Eleesha, Derek, Raluca and Stephen(later in the ship he got active). Hua was also a good pilot even if not very communicative which made us suspicious of her for a long time.<br>It sucks that we got into such an inactive ship, i'm sure we could have gone to Eden with an active Commander, Neron Admin and Researcher.</p><p>Anyway, i had fun with the mush hunt, it was also my real first time as Botanist(The other time i was Mush Ian) and had 8 plants to take care, we didn't die from O2 so i guess i did a decent job despite Andie's first opinion <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And got it Raluca, but at first it seemed you were a little mad, specially before i got confirmed human. Btw, i was the one asking to get you in the mush hunt chat, i trusted you easily, might have been related to how your attitude was in our last ship. You were the best human by far in the Mush ship xD</p><p>Thanks to all of you for the fun time even if with a not so happy ending!</p>
