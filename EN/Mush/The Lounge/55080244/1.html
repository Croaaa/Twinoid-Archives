Whilst discussing these acts of either novice or braven play, she contacts me out of the blue and tells me she's printed <em>the List</em>!</p><p>Trust in our tracker hits a tipping point because I happened to be on the bridge at the time and also saw that she'd not only <em>torn up</em> the List, but she's also taken <em>Finola's List</em>, which was printed only a cycle earlier and torn that up as well! So, the named players: <strong>Hua, Raluca, Kuan-Ti, Stephen</strong>, and <strong>Eleesha</strong> herself.</p><p>Security Officer <strong>Chao</strong> was invited into the chat and it turns out he already had some suspicions (as a good security officer should!) we discuss a few things, including our <strong>Gioele</strong> who had mysteriously parked himself off into FAT for a few cycles and so now we have a red flag on him too. It's the end of my day however and I head off bed, and when I awake for duty next, <strong>Chao</strong> has surgically tortured and killed <strong><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">Kuan-Ti!</strong> That was some serious work, as I didn't even have a single thought about him, with this killing you set us on the path to defeating the Mush!</p>

I had already hidden the <em>Hacking Kit</em> earlier in the voyage whilst conducting the <em>Mush Sample</em> sweep and so I was feeling confident that all would be well.</p><p>The Mush hunt itself was still not leading very far, because our top suspect, <strong>Gioele</strong> for his strange turret dwelling activity had double ate somewhere and thus removed himself from suspicion, at least for the time being, so the current suspect list was something like:<br> <br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/kim_jin_su.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_KJS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Jin-Su</strong> - I like to play what I consider "properly" and not go out of my way to be proven despite the obvious benefits this might have.

She was active, and therefore potentially dangerous.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/ian_soulton.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_IS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Ian</strong> - Our botanist had never been dirty, and had properly spent his time looking after the garden and helping the research goals, but was not confirmed and I don't remove anyone unless they've been recently confirmed...</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/janice_kent.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JK:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Janice</strong> - Relatively quiet, and with access to both dorms.

                <p>It might have been a little confusing at the time but the reason that <strong>Gioele</strong> was quick to accuse me of being the Mush wasn't just because I'd killed the human <strong>Stephen</strong>, it was because he arrived as I'd also unloaded the other 2 charges of my blaster in to <strong>Eleesha</strong> and set about beating her to death once it was empty!</p><p>As the cry went up and <strong>Finola</strong> charged in, the light was just leaving <strong>Eleesha's</strong> eyes as I stood over the 2 dead bodies in the dorm it was enough for <strong>Finola</strong> to take aim with the <em>natamy rifle</em> and fire...</p><p><em><strong>BOOM!</strong></em> - my nose is instantly burst leaving a bloody mess where it used to be.</p><p><em><strong>BOOM!</strong></em> - while I'm still holding my nose a second shot goes off although the recoil on throws her shot and she misses.</p><p><em><strong>BOOM!</strong></em> - the third shot goes off and this time the rifle leave <strong>Finola</strong> with a busted shoulder...</p><p>As the smoke clears it dawns on us all, I was thankfully right, the Mush had transferred into the body of <strong>Eleesha</strong> and we were now reading 2 dead Mush. Whether it was just to be sure, or I'd said something to upset her early <strong>Finola</strong> still somehow manages to fight through the pain while I'm calling for calm, and stick a punch on me!</p><p>By this point <strong>Hua</strong> has already turned up and is probably standing next to <strong>Gioele</strong> wondering what to do now. Through the hole in my uniform jacket I unlatch the <em>plastenite armour</em> I'd been wearing, and as it drops to the floor I collapse onto the now empty bed that <strong>Eleesha</strong> had been lying in. I still have 7 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">, and while I'm not about to tell the crew that, I direct the medical attention to <strong>Roland</strong> who was still a mess in the corner, and right on cue wakes up and patches himself up.

We've meeting lots of Intelligent Life but they mostly just want to give us things besides <em>starmap fragments</em> so our Icarus Bay is converted into a giant food stock room, and from the time I learnt to be a <em>Chef</em> I don't think I ever capped out on points for the remainder of the flight.</p><p>Then around day 13 or 14, we detect a new crystallite field!

The regular team is put together and besides a little disorganisation with the compass, we head down only to be sprayed with some pink spores... <strong>A trap!</strong></p><p>3 of the 4 teammates are hit with spores and reported on the now complete <em>pheromodem</em>, which prompted <strong>Paola</strong> to start a new chat to raise her concerns over the fact that there were <strong>4</strong> members, why only <strong>3</strong> traps?! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/fear.png" alt=":fear:" class="tid_ico"> I do what I can to calm her own and explain that we were all right in the field when the trap was sprung but either way it raises the Mushling doubts again; when the <em>Retro Fungel Serum</em> had been finished I asked <strong>Gioele</strong> to pick it up in order to protect from any would be saboteurs, but instead he hides it under plain <em>view of a camera!</em> It's a form of protection of sorts, so it would have to do.</p><p>Nobody has really been keeping up with the dirty thread although I made an effort to post mine for at least the first 10 days but after that it was relaxed, partly because the soap was in the lab to be modified and upgraded. This research isn't finished however before <em>navigation</em> detect another crystallite field; the <em>aracks</em> are blasted from the ship's hull, and we set a course.</p><p>I'm not part of this expedition and have to watch from the ship, waiting in hope for the beautiful news that the final fragment had been recovered but it was not the first message I receive... <strong>Roland</strong> has gone missing!</p>

I'm realising more and more that with much to be happy about these past few days, the crew are looking more and more to their <em>leader</em> to keep them driven, to keep them focused on the glimmer of hope that we still hold for making it to a <strong>New Eden</strong>.</p><p>Tender moments amongst the crew few and far between, perhaps not so surprising given the circumstances, and besides a shared moment or two between the researchers <strong>Ian &amp; Finola</strong> people are running on pure willpower alone.</p><p>I share a glance and an embrace with <strong>Freida</strong>, her and I have worked together for many years before ending up in this position, and it's painfully clear to see that the spark of mischievous adventure has faded from her under the constant threat of death, failure, and making friendships only for them to be taken from us. While I'm pondering these grim facts we get the report from the away team - <strong><em>Another trap...</em></strong> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>They return with a variety of food and a <em>jar of alien oil</em> but the pain is clear to see, it's back to the grind, and to make matters worse still, we're <strong>running out of fuel</strong> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fuel.png" alt=":mush_fuel:" class="tid_ico">, the main tanks are practically empty, and what little is left on the bridge is being chipped away every time I prep the engines to leave orbit. The search for the last fragment will have to be put on hold while we find a suitable planet to mine.</p><p>We're lucky, very lucky, and within the day <em>navigation</em> have found us a planet rich in <strong>hydrocarbons</strong>! I give the mission to clear the <em>aracks</em> from the hull again and we plot our course!</p><p>We were brought crashing down though as during the flight two large steel plates dislodge from the hull of alpha dorm and crush <strong>Terrence</strong>, our quiet but effective <em>tech/pilot</em> is dead... I say a few words of remembrance and call a meeting, morale is low enough already and whilst our <em>shrink</em> is doing all she can to deal with the harsh reality of our situation so can't help everyone, and although I would never show it to the crew, I'm needing more and more of <strong>Janice</strong>'s time myself, <em>"No man is an Island"</em> as the quote goes...</p><p>The meeting is a great success, and besides <strong>Miss Rinaldo</strong> who wasn't able to attend the crew are feeling renewed, we even managed to slip some jokes into it! ( <em><strong>+8</strong></em> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_pmo:" class="tid_ico"> )</p><p>The away team heads to the expedition, and again I monitor the situation from the ship still resting after the high spirits of the night before and the initial reports are excellent! We've not only managed to successfully drill two separate regions for precious <em>hydrocarbons</em> but while the team were trekking over a mountain the find yet another deposit! Of course the rollercoaster of life aboard the Daedalus kicks in again at this point and I get the report that <strong>Mr. Zucalli</strong> has become lost again!</p><p>Our luck turns and at the dying moments of the expedition he's found, and the <em>Icarus</em> returns to the bay full of fuel, a little oxygen and... <em>NO <strong>HUA</strong>!</em> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We're firefighting on the ship as it is and with <strong>Terrence</strong> dead, and <strong>Roland</strong> 'off-duty' that only leaves me able to launch the mission to recover everyone's favourite pumpkin but I just can't face it, I'm exhausted and couldn't face eating anything she's going to have to stay there for several hours... Thankfully the planet has oxygen at least, and of all the crew she's the hardiest, and trained <em>survivalist</em> nearly always in a good mood.</p><p>Some hours later I lead the rescue mission and despite some complaining from <strong>Hua</strong> herself who seems to have had a little too much of the atmosphere on the planet ( See favourite convo. thread ) she's recovered and some aliens living on the planet offer us another <em>jar of alien oil</em>.</p><p>With a sigh of relief we return, head out into open orbit and settle in for the night not knowing that the worst blow yet was coming... During the night both members of our <em>navigation</em> team were killed as more of the ship collapsed.</p><p>Both <em><strong>Paola</strong></em> and <em><strong>Freida</strong></em> were gone...</p>
