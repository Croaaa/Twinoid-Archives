                <p>Hey, Chao here. <img src="http://twinoid.com/img/icons/mush/wang_chao.png" alt=":tid_mush_tease_WC:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It was a fun ship, even if I still feel sorta sad for that I had to ruin a ship with such potential, considering the klix investments, a Chun and a Roland who seemed to really know what they were doing, and such things as getting two sofa blueprints on the ship and a lizaro jungle. The diplomat skillbook was a nice addition too (even if <em>Chao</em> didn't want to admit it. <em>"Hippie crap!"</em>).</p><p>I wouldn't agree on that it was you telling the wrong person that led to the ship's demise, but that's from my point of view. Looking forward to seeing the summary of the ship out of a human's perspective. I'll give mine afterwards.</p>

                <p>OK. To my memory, here's basically what happened...<br>As Chun, after I woke up, I started all the necessary threads, caught the astropad up, installed a camera, etc. before going to sleep to recover points. Later, everyone had woken up and me and Finola were working on research... I had hoped that Eleesha would be active and lead the mush hunt, but she was an inactive this game. So: day 5. No mush killed, but several handy anti-mush researches completed. Janice, the comms officer, just managed to print the xyloph list, so I decide to start an impromptou mush hunting thread and stack up evidence against people that anyone can add to (note: I am not a very good mush hunter), and left the lab for the first time in a while to plant a few mycoalarms and poke around a bit. I was headed to the engine room to see if Terrence was there (Raluca was also an inactive), when I noticed that in the logs, Chao had spored right in front of him. I told Finola and Roland in an active PM, additionally saying how Terrence was probably a mush as well, as Roland seemed pretty trustworthy and Finola had shown up on the list, so she was probably still human. Turns out she wasn't, and a few demoralizes later I had died of sad at cycle change. It seems my death helped catch a few mush though, and Roland avenged my death pretty well. No idea what happened after that.</p>

                <p>Here's how my story went:</p><p>I woke up to find a ship that was for the moment full of life. People were running around (many being bronze newbies doing odd stuff before getting organized) and a Chun and a Roland that stood out as the two that would be fun working together with whilst hunting the Mush threat.</p><p><em>"Well well, what do we have here? A Chun that knows what she's doing. It'll be fun hunting the Mush with you."</em></p><p>...is some of my last words before going to sleep that day. When I woke up, the Mush had been picked... and <em>I wAS oNe oF tHEm</em>.</p><p>From this point and on, I took a more passive approach to the game, not acting too much but writing quite a bit, and being patient. From day one of being human and moving around items, I was still sitting on the blaster and the knife, and the other one was in the lab where no-one would dare to touch it without being called Mush.</p><p>And I waited, waited, and waited the first day, at around cycle 7-8 Terrence came around too, and he was rather new, and capitalized on it, already being dirty and in the front alpha turret, he spored like a god that first day before all the anti-mush research were done. He then acted as if he was a semi-active player for a big part of the game.</p><p>Then we got an opportunity to strike - the newbies were growing suspicious of each other and started killing themselves. <em>PoOr HUMANS... heegh heegh heegh.</em></p><p>So I killed the last newbie running amok, Stephen who'd managed to kill both Paola and Eleesha (one of the other newbies died of starvation and our Raluca who didn't say a word and ate one of our infected rations that was just lying in Alpha Bay for no reason died of depression sadly before we could capitalize on her eating the ration), and snuck in a spore on Finola on the way there - she was being too good at research, we had to stop them if we wanted to be patient sneaky Mush.</p><p>Terrence managed to spike her on the way of dismantling the shower, and then I trapped the medlab when she came to lie down there later.</p><p>Finola turned out to be a great and resourceful agent, being both on the "definitely not alpha mush" list and also one of Chun's most trusted, in addition to also being gold and being good at healing and making ceasefires should we need it (and we did).</p><p>So we hung out for another day, thinking that turning Ian or Gioele would be good next. I was loading fuel to move the ship, and decided to spore while going there... <strong>and spaced out and did it while Terrence also was in the room. SHIT!</strong></p><p>So I freaked out, and we came up with the plan: Let's redirect attention from the engine room to the bridge, make the people who relayed go work on astro instead. If no-one entered for a day, we'd be fine.</p><p>But then Chun had to start her impromptu mush hunt, and we decided she had to go. We started organizing a depress-kill coup on her, I was sorta screwed, so I thought I'd remove the camera in the Lab so Finola could go in for the demoralize while I killed as many as I could. Did not turn out to be the case, as Chun left the room while we were discussing how to handle matters, and I watched her hide myco-alarms around the ship. I saw her go to the refectory, Alpha Bay, Rear Alpha Storage... <em>the Engine Room</em>.</p><p>So that's when I realized I was screwed, and I got it confirmed by that Finola had received it in a private chat that I had been busted. So we pretended that she went in to attempt killing me in the lab, and she sure grabbed the blaster alright...</p><p><em>...bUT tHE ReSiSTAnt oNE weRE thE oNE tO dIE.</em></p><p>We knew that Roland also had received the message of me being Mush, so I had to go off him by force. Terrence built me a grenade, <span class="tid_sideNote">Was it you who hid the first grenade, Chun?</span> and I went in guns blazing on Roland. A mission and a spore later he dropped after being brutally stabbed to death by <em>mE. Other fleshlings gave up on life too, dying by fatal depression</em>. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sq_sadist:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The rest of the crew couldn't really stand up to me in force, but they tried killing me through death by a thousand cuts. So Finola had to save me with a ceasefire and healed me from 1HP to 11HP (Medic is AMAZING).</p><p>When the ceasefire ended, Gioele came in and beat her to death, and not so much later after that Gioele was Mush too. With six people left on the ship, of which 3 were Mush, we tried to keep the ship intact in order to <em>dispose</em> of the rest of the human crew for a Mush Win.</p><p>Alas, the Traxes wouldn't leave us alone, and with 19 hunters on our tail, and Chao's fleshy body getting exhausted, the Mush realized they couldn't cause any more damage. Looking like something from a horror movie, bloody and without a nose (Ian beat that off, so much for his pacifist talk), Chao lay down in the sofa on the Bridge, fires getting ever so closer to it, and was slain in his sleep by Kuan Ti who decided to stop being inactive 6 hours before the ship blew up. So the humans lost, but the Mush didn't quite <em>win</em> either.</p><p><strong>The End</strong>.</p>
