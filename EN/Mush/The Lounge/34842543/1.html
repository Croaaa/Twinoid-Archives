                <p><strong><em>THE MUSH HUNT</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>DAY ONE</em></strong></p><p>I was probably one of the last few ones to be decryogenised. There were a lot of chatter on the general channel. However, strangely, the Mush Sample and the Apron weren’t in the Lab! Where could they be? So, I scoured the ship with a fine-tooth comb and found the Mush Sample in the Engine Room. Who on Sol thought it would be a good idea to put a highly delicate and rare alien specimen in the same room as hyperspace engines and radioactive reactors?</p><p>Finola was the last of us to awaken from her cryo, and promptly discovered where our Apron was. Apparently, Ian was wearing it, and he was non-responsive to our prodding. Our…”intentions”…might be misunderstood if we were to rip that piece of clothing off his body, so we couldn’t do much. The good doctor refused to touch her research without the Apron, so she decided to crash in medical a bit longer, while I hung around the lab. Our resident billionaire and our genius physicist were also there with me…sadly, they hadn’t said a word. Not only that, they were doubling over in pain from starvation. It didn’t look promising. At least I know they were human, as agents of Mush do not starve.</p><p>While we were waiting, a disturbingly large number of people got dirty. Some sauces splashed on Stephen while he was cooking. He still hasn’t said a word to us. Paola spilled some food on herself as she ate. Although, why on Sol would she need to eat? She hasn’t exactly done anything that consumed energy since she woke up. Our commander, Jin Su, got grease on him while attempting to fix the Pilgred. Did Jin Su secretly obtain a PhD in Jumpdrive Engineering or Hyperspace Physics since Tamina? Why would he attempt to work on it without Raluca? Roland, our normally playful pilot, was dirty for some unknown reason in the Bridge. He, too, hadn’t said a word!</p><p>Later that day, Ian finally woke up and removed the Apron willingly. I didn’t quite get why our good doctor was fine with putting on someone else’s clothes, but god forbid a drop of slide stain might touch her skin! Anyway, she was now willing to begin her work on the sample’s physiology…and she requested for my assistance. <strong>My</strong> assistance. Unlike Finola, I did not have a doctorate in alien biology, or a rock star reputation in the world of medicine. However, I was still happy assist in any way possible…even if it was to stand around handing her instruments when she needed them. And it was worth it - Finola was absolutely brilliant! In just a few hours, she managed to pump some anti-sporing gas through our ventilation, and also manufactured a constipation serum that specifically targeted the Mush…both researches designed to limit the activities of the Mushies hiding amongst us.</p><p>Oh, I forgot to mention. According to NERON’s limited sensors, we had two agents of Mush amongst us. This was Tamina all over again…</p><br><p><strong><em>DAY TWO</em></strong></p><p>Raluca died of depression today. I knew she hated being around people. But why didn’t she walk a few steps away to a more secluded location, escapes me. Apparently, self-torture is a symptom of Cryonitis, too, on top of being unresponsive!</p><p>Shortly after waking up from a brief nap, I noticed that Janice, our resident shrink, claimed that she got dirty while doing research. Except she didn’t. While the room logs did show Janice passing through while I was napping in the Lab, there was no evidence that she ever laid a hand on the research terminal! She lied about the reason she got dirty! Not only that, NERON now detects an additional Mush agent on board! I had seen this in Tamina, before. I knew what I had to do. Silently, I left the lab and picked up the knife and armour from the storage. Then…I walked into the dorms and promptly made a few puncture holes in Janice! I forgot how tiresome murder was, so Hua had to finish the job for me. Within moments, we had a dead Mush agent, which NERON rather unhappily confirmed. It was a shame that the Mush got to our shrink. But we did what we had to do.</p><p>Eleesha, the journalist, didn’t wake up today. Cryonitis must have damaged her brain functions, too. Poor girl. Chao, our head of security, still hadn’t said a word to us. I believed he, too, suffered from the cursed affliction! This posed a problem. Who was tracking the Mush, if they were both out of commission? It was up to me, a humble nurse, it seemed. Jin Su, our commander, noted the excellent job we’ve done ending the life of one Mush agent, and tasked me with a mission to hunt for the remaining Mush. So, with the help of Hua who painstakingly collected the room logs, I managed to deduce the other mush that came aboard with us and helped Janice with the Mush infection. Only one person was in the “right” room at the “right” time.</p><p>It was Paola. That would certainly explain the lack of progress on Comms. We were still physically drained from killing the first mush, and yet, I still had to do it. I had no choice. If there was one thing I had learnt from Tamina, it was that the Mush threat will not solve itself. No one was going to come to my rescue. It was up to me. So, I picked up the knife and tried to separate Paola’s head from her body…except once again I was plagued by fatigue! Hua boosted her energy with a ration and finished the job…again. To my relief, NERON confirmed that the now-late Paola was a Mush agent. I mean, I knew I was right about Paola, but it was still a relief.</p><p>The last mush, I had deduced to be either Roland or Terrence, both victims of severe Cryonitis. Given our exhaustion after helping two Mushies towards their expiry, we decided to let it be, words of wisdom some mother by the name of Mary may have once said. After all, Cryonitis seemed to affect both humans and Mush alike. There was no reason to think we’re under threat from the remaining Mush agent.</p><br><p><strong><em>DAY THREE</em></strong></p><p>Praise the lord, Roland made a miraculous recovery from his Cryonitis! Only, it wasn’t truly a miracle. Roland still hadn’t said a word, despite my attempts to coax something out of him. Furthermore, he started running around the front side of the ship - from the Bridge where Frieda was, to the Front Corridor where Terrence was, to the Medlab where Finola was…all rooms with no camera! Not only that, he walked into the Garden, an empty room, for no apparent reason. An hour later, he returned to the Bridge. He was dirty, and still hadn’t spoke a word.</p><p>Convinced that Roland must be our last Mush agent, I grabbed the knife and sprung into action. I know what you must be thinking. You’re thinking that this nurse had lost it. That she was getting drunk on violence. My crew mates didn’t say anything, but I was sure they were thinking it, too. Why else would a nurse be so eager to gut people open with a knife? But you see, they weren’t people. Not anymore. Not since the Mush took control of them. I had no choice…those poor souls had to be put down. The situation wasn’t even a stranger to me. Why else did you think I was the only survivor of the Tamina incident, even though the infection wasn’t fatal for the victims?</p><p>I successfully ended Roland after shredding his chest into nine unequal pieces. To my genuine surprise, he was human. <strong>Human</strong>! How could it be…I was completely convinced he was a Mush agent! For the next thirty minutes, I was in a state of confusion, disbelief, and guilt. I had never killed a human before! With my mind still clouded, I tried rationalising it silently:</p><p>1. Roland might have had hosted a Mush which Transferred into someone else. Only, he couldn’t have, because he searched for his Walkie-Talkie in the Bridge, and thus couldn’t have had the experience needed to pull such move.</p><p>2. It was a mercy killing - Roland must be suffering greatly from his time on the Daedalus. Was that a good enough excuse to kill another human being?</p><p>3. It was a necessary risk, given he had given every indication that he was a Mush agent. The risk assessment numbers stacked against him.</p><p>4. He was going to die anyway, and this helped us confirm the identity our last Mush agent - Terrence. How else were we going to find that out?</p><p>5. NERON granted Roland the “Acting Comms Officer” title, except given his cryo-induced condition, he clearly wasn’t up to the job!</p><p>A few cycles later, our commander grabbed a Blaster and burnt Terrence into several chunks of crisps. NERON confirmed Terrence as our third and final Mush agent. I was right about that, at least. His death was followed by another from one of our Cryonitis patients, Gioele. I suppose the weight of the crew deaths around the ship was too much for the billionaire to bear. Age and cryo must have softened his heart, considering he wasn’t made of glass when he was a businessman.</p><p>Finally. The mush threat was over.</p>

                <p><strong><em>THE END OF DAYS</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>DAY FOUR</em></strong></p><p>This was the 4th day in a row we had failed to establish any sort of communication with the Rebel Bases or the Xyloph Database. First, we had Comms Officer Paola ignoring her human responsibilities, just because she had a tiny little infection. Then, after killing her, NERON granted Hua the title of Acting Comms Officer, only to be stolen by Cryonitis-patient Roland just before she could do anything with it. After the death of Roland, Hua re-inherited the title, although she had to take care of the Hunters surrounding the Daedalus, first.</p><p>We desperately needed to retrieve the Technician’s instruction manual from the Xyloph Database, if we were to repair the Pilgred Reactor! For this mission, we allowed Hua access to as many food rations as she needed. In fact, we encouraged her to eat our share, to keep her energy up for both her jobs. It was only sometime in late Day 4 when she finally had the energy to work on Comms…</p><p>Except, our Comms link randomly got disconnected before she could do anything.</p><br><p><strong><em>DAY FIVE</em></strong></p><p>Twice. Our connection to Sol was interrupted randomly, twice. We patiently attempted reconnecting it again, and again. I played the role as cook, delivery girl, and cheerleader for Hua in our all-too-important task of getting the link re-established.</p><p>When it finally happened, we had permanently lost the opportunity to contact the first two rebel bases. However, we managed to establish contact with the third rebel base. The crew’s morale was deteriorating rapidly, so we knew it was vital to establish contact with the fourth rebel base. However, there wasn’t any hint of its transmission, yet, so we had to wait. While waiting, Hua continued trying to decode the Xyloph Database, in hopes to retrieve some instruction manuals.</p><p>Our connection to Sol was once again interrupted.</p><br><p><strong><em>DAY SIX</em></strong></p><p>The crew’s Morale were doing much better. Many of us were on the verge of throwing in the towel after the deaths of two more of our comatose crew members, Chao and Stephen. Hua finally established communications with the fourth rebel base, just in a nick of time to boost our spirits!</p><p>Emboldened by the success, Hua proceeded to scour the Xyloph Database, hoping to find the coveted Technician’s instruction manual.</p><p>Except, once again, our connection was disconnected.</p><p>Later that day, after we successfully reestablished the link, the instruction manuals continued to evade us, despite unlocking 14 of the 16 sectors in the database. Just before the day’s end, however, Hua completely downloaded every sector of the Xyloph Database. We found the Pilot and Robotics Expert instruction manuals, but there was no sign of a Technician’s one.</p><p>Hunters tracked down the Daedalus soon after, but no one was awake or had the energy to deal with them! Being a nurse and research assistant was no longer enough for me, I finally realised. Some time between Tamina and now, I had become another person. I was too much of a fighter to not join the other pilots on the front lines…so I absorbed as much as I could from the Pilot instruction manual, and took a Patrol Ship out to shoot down the enemy vessels!</p><br><p><strong><em>DAY SEVEN</em></strong></p><p>We started repairing the Pilgred in organised shifts. We didn’t have the necessary expertise on the ship, so we had to make do. Hua worked on upgrading NERON’s version, in hopes that NERON would miraculously recover Daedalus’ defensive Plasma Shields. Jin Su and myself kept our energy up for the pending hunter attacks. Frieda continued to scan for our second suitable planet. Everyone else, including Finola the good doctor, worked on the Pilgred Reactor. It was somewhat amusing watching her put on an apron while meticulously avoiding the grease from touching her delicate fingers, while tinkering with the machinery.</p><p>We barely noticed when Eleesha, the last of our Cryonitis patient, died from a cause I don’t even remember what. What happened to us? How have we become so numb to the deaths of our human crew?</p><p>There were only seven of us, left.</p><p>Oh, before I forget, our link to Sol was randomly disrupted, before we had the chance to contact the sixth rebel base. Of course, it was only a natural fact of life that comms link gets interrupted once or twice a day, no?</p><br><p><strong><em>DAY EIGHT</em></strong></p><p>Kuan Ti, the ship’s designer, tragically passed away from a freak injury today. We were now down to six alive. Perhaps if he designed his ship better, he would still be alive. Wait, what am I saying? How could I be so callous?</p><p>We somehow repaired the Pilgred to 25%, even with our limited resources. Could we really last long enough to complete the repairs?</p><p>The crew’s spirits were in the dumps. We were once again on the verge of air locking ourselves to end our suffering. I had a plan to boost our commander’s spirits by giving him exclusive access to our tasty bananas, and gathering us all in a room while our commander motivates us with a speech or two.</p><p>That didn’t happen. Instead of gathering us into a single room, he gave speeches to each one of us individually, across three or four rooms. I hope he had enough energy to motivate the entire crew. Not only that, our commander had to move the ship to evade asteroids before Hua had the chance to establish contact with the last rebel base, further dampening our spirits.</p><p>Perhaps there were a lot on Jin Su’s mind, to not be able to gather us into a room. I didn’t blame him. All I could think was: we weren’t going to make it.</p><br><p><strong><em>DAY NINE</em></strong></p><p>Connection to Sol interrupted. Cause: unknown. Good morning to you, too, NERON.</p><p>NERON also informed us that there were 22 hunters and asteroids outside the Daedalus. The expedition to the planet hadn’t yet happened, and I doubted it will. So, I did what I could - I rode the Patrol Ship for the fourth time since I learnt how to fly, and destroyed all the Aracks and half the Trax. It was now up to our commander to remove us from this battlefield.</p><p>Jin Su woke up just on time, and we were in secure space once again. Our hulls were down to 18%, and I wasn’t sure how much more of this we can handle. It had dawned on me that we weren’t going to make it back home. We were going to die here.</p><p>But I wasn’t going down without a fight. <em>We</em> weren’t going down without a fight. So, we modified our plans. We abandoned all efforts to repair the Pilgred, and instead focused solely on survival. We were determined to survive for at least one more day, despite the odds stacked against us. They weren’t taking us that easy.</p><br><p><strong><em>DAY TEN</em></strong></p><p>We made it. Time since NERON re-activation: Day 10, Cycle 1. A spit in the face to anyone who thought this bunch couldn’t possibly make it this far.</p><p>Bad news was, we had 22 hunters and asteroids, again, outside the Daedalus. Time was of the essence - I jumped on a patrol ship and expended all my energy on destroying the Aracks and Trax. Our commander was still asleep. However, Hua might have the energy to hack, and she woke up <em>just</em> in the nick of time.</p><p>Except, as our luck would have it, she failed to hack the terminal.</p><p>I watch the countdown with dread. 30 more seconds. This is it. The end of the road. I suppose…this journal will be my last words. It has been quite a journey. I’m proud of us.</p><p>I’m ready now.</p><p>At the very last second, while the Daedalus’ hulls were being torn apart, I swear I saw Jin Su stir from his sleep…</p><p>GTKW$%IOHDA$YJ(RE#S@#$%^000110101110101011010101110101001010010010101</p><br><p><strong><em>THE END!</em></strong></p>

                <p>nice summary never thought this ship would get this far at first with all the inactives. we did great with what little had put out a lot of fire.Then all of us came close to death more then once. Then end of the ship come pretty close if wasn't for the damn asteroid it would have most likely been of lack of o2 but what amazing ending for this ship hope to see you guys again.</p>
