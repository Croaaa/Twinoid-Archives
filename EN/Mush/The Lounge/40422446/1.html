Good evening sirs and ma'ams!</p><p>Boy oh Boy! What a ride this was.</p><p>The early game went well enough. I had pushed out Antispore and constispore early to cripple the mush spore production. All had went well up until we went on our very first expo.</p><p>During the expo we lost Derek due to a bug. No sooner had Derek been "abandoned" then suddenly, mysteriously, someone ELSE died on the Daedalus. The Expedition team, consisintg of Jin Su, Kuan Ti, Myself, and Roland, were all biting our nails as we waited for that last countdown. None of us had walkies due to an int life zone (which stole my bloody compass -.- )</p><p>When we got back we found what had happened. Gold Hua, an alpha had our second shower before Stephen could reinforce it, stole the soap, Medkit, and apron, transferred into Frieda, killed her old body, and launched the Pasiphae.</p><p>Rather than give up, we decided to try and rush Magnetic net, pushing through a good four projects in the space of a day! That included, of all things, plasma shield, which went up incredibly quickly. Despite my reservations, Fire detector and Anomoly detector proved to be invaluable throughout the entire Journey. In the end, it proved to be a good idea to push through projects even though we never saw the Magnetic net because...</p><p>Ian, my wonderful lab partner, was Mush!</p><p>Likely taking a cue from his partner, he slimetrapped most of the crew, including Paola and myself, and took off with the wrench and an extinguisher. Further crippling us! But not without first trying his damnest to murder me in my sleep. Little did they know that I only had 2 HP after their attack! I got very lucky, and it spurred Paola and I to quickly fix the combustion chamber and hack the CC to abandon both of our alphas. Vital equipment or not! To counter the loss of pilots, I ended up going gold and eventually ending up as our primary pilot on the ship!</p><p>Of course, our woes were not over. Because we had both showers dismantled and no apron, research pretty much ended there. Denying us the cure. We quickly implemented a strict regime for showers. Everyone who was going to shower had a specific day to do so, and the people who showered were required to eat as much as they could before they did so, so they would not need to eat for several days.</p><p>Naturally Gioele ignored this and stole Paola's shower on day 4. After an argument, he took the hacker kit messing with bios and started tearing up items and eating in the Icarus bay. He was promptly murdered afterwards for his waste. Paola landing the finishing blow. The next few days were busy, as I had to struggle to regain AP, and several people had to fix their flagging morale. Injuries were difficult to handle as well, as the only place we could heal people was medlab.</p><p>That said, eventually I got the second sofa plan built in the refectory, in addition to all the coffee I could eat. Jin su remained clean through the mush attack, and became our primary planet scanner. Finding us many, many good planets (Roland, in Ian's body, remarked that he was like Frieda reborn). A few times our O2 or HC search was tight, but we always managed to find what we needed. I will not forget Janice, Stephen, Ian, and Kuan Ti. All four being major players in our expeditions! While Jin wasn't as active as he could have been, he was very responsive and good about moving us. Those few times he wasn't, we normally found someone to move the ship for us.</p><p>The hardest part of the later journey was keeping everyone at full health. Without the medkit things became very dangerous at times. We couldn't heal someone unless they were online and able to move to medlab. This, unfortunately, was difficult to explain to Raluca. She did not speak english well, and only reported her health and morale when she was in danger. This proved to be her undoing when, at 1HP/3Morale, nobody was online to heal her.</p><p>As day 12 drew to a close, fires had injured Janice and Kuan Ti, bringing them both extremely low on health. With the risk of losing at least two people next cycle, I decided that enough was enough and moved us to Sol before we lost too many more good players to the ship.</p><p>It was a pleasure serving, Sir's and Ma'ams! I would do so again. (Especially you Ioland!)</p>

Ian here, formerly known as Roland!</p><p>You forgot No Soap, No Extinguishers, No Wrench... we had to build the Extinguishers and lucky to get a Firefighter skill book!</p><p>1 Star Map only... our first one was a huge morale boost. We deserved at least a 2nd piece. That would've inspired the remaining crew to fight the urge to return.</p><p>Out of all those expeditions we got the Bumpjunkins too late....

                <p>I was feeling too tired to type .... so much typing was involved on the ship....</p><p>Our only inactive in the beginning was Eleesha, I was really worried killing her because of no more chance to get a list printed. I don't truly remember if did, or she starved on her own.</p><p>Terrence gave up the ghost, went completely inactive around Day 7 or 8.... Starved on his own.</p><p>Jin Su did a great job finding us many, many planets! Honestly, I've never been on a ship that had so much food available at all times before this one. We probably went through close to 60-70 Standard Rations. It was never an issue.</p><p>I inherited 7 Hydropots from our mush Ian and then we got 3 more. 10 plants were in good shape untill the end. We had 1 Banana tree, 1 Fragilane, 2 Bumpjunkins and 6 Cactus trees. Andie, Paola, Chun, Kuan Ti and Stephen helped me taking turns holding all of them until the very end.</p><p>We promoted our most active &amp; communicative Bronze players to permanent Silver. You all guys deserved it! Paola got and Kuan Ti did great job on Comms scanning and NEXUS work.</p><p>Chun I'm trully sorry, I would've gladly gifted you permanent Silver too, only I simply ran out of MT passes. You did outstanding job with the Fires and Scanning while I was sleeping. Dropping drones all over the ship and generally helping out where we needed it. You deserved to get one Silver gift from me but I had to give it to the other 2 crew members simply because the skills they could unlock would've helped us survive better than the possibility of your Gold skills. In another life, I'll do it for you!</p><p>Stephen Apprenticed IT Expert and took a Tech skill book, Him and Raluca finished PILGRED in a couple of cycles right after we ditched the mush. He was instrumental with getting Plasma Shield and few other Projects really fast when we were still digging for Magnetic Net to bring our mush back.</p><p>I'm sad to loose 2 Gold mush players during our escape, I was pushing my colleague Andie to cure one of them. I always feel it's a big loss when we must abandon a Gold player... They kind of left us no choice. When Ian took my body and flew out, we were already scrambling for Oxygen and had no other option. There wouldn't be enough time to finish the cure with no Apron and fight/kill one of them off to cure the other.. Sad sad...</p><p>Derek, that bug was a total disaster, completely uncalled for and undeserving death... We missed you greatly!</p><p>Later in our voyage, we were all so tired and lost concentration, we launched an expedition to a planet without O2 without spacesuits... by the time we got back to re-launch, Kuan Ti was already AFK, so we went with 3 Space suits only... Shiver went down my spine worried we would loose Kuan Ti to that stupid glitch again... Thankfully it didn't happen this time.</p><p>Raluca, ... Raluca Raluca.... I'm glad you said you learned a lot and hope you had fun, As I read on your comment. I'm sad to loose you but we couldn't keep up any more. Thank you for all your efforts with NEXUS and PILGRED. She listent to our advice mostly, but somehow failed to understand the concept of using Chit-Chat with Andie every new day. I believe English wasn't her home language and some things might have been hard to understand or lost in translation.</p><p>Janice must love her Aliens! She single-handedly got us probably over 20 Rations and over 10-15 Alien Fruits... It never failed...</p><p>Was stressful at the end but fun overall. Great job everybody, considering the circumstances we did what we could.</p><p>Like is said earlier, the 1st map piece was a morale booster, we deserved at least a 2nd one. We had the opportunities. It would've inspired usto keep going.</p><p>Cya in the verse.</p>

I feel partially responsible for the lack of shower, and really hope that it was not my comment that gave them the idea. I talked about mush slimetrapping after removing the showers and then they did that...I thought we were done for.

I didn't want to play the sneaky human pretending mush so chose to follow in my partners footsteps of sabotage. I am so pleasantly surprised at how far this crew carried the ship after the sabotage, bodysnatching and thievery, furthering my regret of not being a human.
