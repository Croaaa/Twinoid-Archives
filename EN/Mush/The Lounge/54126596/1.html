No Eden, but a nice return to Sol with the serum on D15.</p><p>The ship had started quite well, with an active and very talkative crew (hey Frenchies&nbsp;<img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) who had fun roleplaying while the ship was filling. But then Mush Ian woke up and immediately outed himself and his partner Hua, then mutated. I had barely finished killing him when I turned my head and saw that Janice had started beating Chun to death. I kicked her out and killed her, only to see that Terrence had finished Chun off. While I was getting rid of our third griefer, Hua ran to the Pasiphae and took off with an extinguisher and (we discovered that later) the compass. <em>Grmpf.</em></p><p>We tried to rush projects to get Magnetic Net, and it did came out pretty soon, but along with Plasma shield. We eventually decided to do the shield and abandon Hua. She haunted our Pasiphae until the end, leaving us spooky messages via the ship's astropad :</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/2/3/5bd48883_516.jpg">AAAAH, a ghost !</a><br><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/0/d/849190db_516.jpg">No, you won't scare us with your mushy threats.</a><br><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/4/3/4339158b_516.jpg">Nice try, but you didn't fool us.</a><br><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/1/5/fbae73cf_516.jpg">Ah... so that's where the compass went...</a><br><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/b/3/9dfdf535_516.jpg">I'm telling you, we're not scared.</a><br><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/3/7/4a629bb9_516.jpg">A little annoyed at our survival, are we, Miss Jiang ?</a><br><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/e/5/8f88382b_516.jpg">Surrender ? Never !</a></p><p>With no diplomat and no compass, expeditions were a little difficult. We did try, though, facing shipwrecks creatures and other monsters, but hoping for Eden would have been a little too ambitious. Still, we managed to survive without a single casualty, even though we had no shrink and no last hope, which made morale difficult to manage too, but thankfully our two leaders gave us great inspirational speeches.</p><p>And now let's settle back on Sol and have a good rest, everyone. Thanks for the trip. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

A dozen minutes later, some griefer Ian woke up, triggered Mush selection, was chosen along with me and decided to outright out us. Greaaat.<br>Fortunately, the rest of the crew took care of the griefers first and the next cycle was very near. Unfortunately, I panicked and completely forgot that I had the phagocyte skill. As soon as cycle change, with the little energy I had, I grabbed what was in rear corridor (an extinguisher and the compass), took off in the Pasiphae, and then realized how I could have gained way more energy and done more damage. I basically only thought about saving my life at first <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"><br>So I spored and phagocyted in the Pasi and decided to wait a bit until my AP bar was full. There were a couple griefers down, Janice and Chun were dead, the Sol link still wasn't up: there was room for a morale massacre. I knew they wouldn't just abandon me in space, and they began to rush the projects to get the net. Which appeared very quickly… along with the plasma shield. And before I could connect back, they had finished the latter project, and lacking the former they just abandoned me. And Crazy eye Chao was guarding the bay anyway, I learned after. Saddest death ever.</p><p>But I didn't have my share of fun… I stayed on the death page to read the chat, and I decided to haunt the Pasiphae room of the astropad <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I think Peanutz screened all of them; she would say on IRC "I can't find the wrench" and I went and added it in the pad and then came back on IRC to taunt her <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> I was mad at their surviving all those fires and roomshakes, with me stranded in my Pasiphae… But it was fun, and it surprised some people to see such a ghost.</p><p>So, yeah, that was a good crew. I read all the chat, found Paola very crazy (but maybe she'll explain herself why… I can't wait to read from her!). Good crew, quite reactive, and quite funny. That D15 Sol return was deserved. I really wish I could have played this ship. I wish I could have killed you all!</p>

I suspected it was you <strong>Peanutz</strong>, I was Janice in our previous ship and your Chao's awesome organization skills were very familiar <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I jumped on MMM right after another very nice ship and found myself again surrounded by great, mostly active players. From our start until the very end I enjoyed watching your role play (especially Paola and her crazy talk about visiting <em>Kivanç</em>, which I now understand a lot better!).</p><p>I think we did great considering our morale issues and the long-lost Pasiphae. I laughed out loud with Hua's astropad updates and Chao's subsequent <em>"go to hell!"</em> posts.</p><p>Thanks all for these 15 days, and see you all soon I hope.<br>&lt;3</p>
