                <p>Mush Conquest</p><p>Ship had a late start. Soon end of day 1, perhaps even start of day 2, the ship still wasn't filled. Bam, I felt the mush taking over my body. <strong>(I'm) Paola</strong> was no longer the same. Nor was Janice. Fortunately we were both active players, although with Paola who is soon expected to be stuck in the bridge room, we had little time to act.</p><p>Now this is the first time I became a mush, so I panic abit of what to do and not to do to be obvious. Janice who has been mush quite a few times, gave me a hand and gave me quick instructions. After we slimed the cameras in both dorms, we were deciding our target. We couldn't decide who to spike, but when Andie came up and asked for relay in research, we immediately rushed to her "aid". 2 spores on her now. We were fortunate that Gioele wasn't <em>paranoid</em>. No camera in Laboratory.</p><p>I've repeatedly told crew members that I needed them to fix link for me so I could dump my "saved" AP. They weren't that quick, but it bought me time to replenish some AP. Not to meantion I had a very, very late sofa, which I had to build myself.</p><p>I attempted to contact Eleesha and put my falsified theory about other crew members acting mushy. She took the bait and agreed, adding or directing her attention away from us. I hadn't planned to go further than that. However, on her own initiative, she turned the channel into mush hunt, where I was now part of. Added Andie who was still human, we discussed mushy actions of other members.</p><p>Cameras broke around day (3) change so Eleesha went to check the other room log (was in same room as Andie), and Janice put the final spore on Andie in her absence, recruiting another fellow. All according to plan. <em>That's not how it really went, humans are unpredictable beings</em></p><p>At this point, it became more obvious who were inactives. It'd just one or two days before she narrow it down to us, not to mention the later added Kuan Ti came to the same conclusion, who ran his own mush hunt channel where I was invited. He was suspecting Eleesha being mush, due to she has been to both dorms when cameras broke. He did however, suspect me, Janice and Andie too. I didn't push further on that Eleesha issue or divert attetion away from us. I just simply agreed to his theories, fearing that I might act suspicious.</p><p>We had a discussion among ourselves who to convert. I still had 1 spore left from our initial start, Janice and Andie made one each on Day 3. We all agreed that we should convert either Eleesha or Kuan Ti. So far, these two were the most active mush hunters. All of us were in their narrowed downed list, yet mush hunt still continued on same channel, with me and Andie in it. Perhaps they were testing us, perhaps they thought we couldn't be mush.</p><p>Anyhow, we all knew we had to make a move fast. But we were stuck on how we should proceed from there. They were staying under cameras, and We couldn't go breaking them again. That would reveal us this time. We threw ideas until an opportunity arises. Frieda found a planet and Kuan Ti volunteered to be part of expo team! Now at this point we had questionables inactives where two of them stayed inactive in Icarus Bay for some reason. Our pilots were inactive as well so that leaves Jin Su and Andie left. Andie who happily applied to be the pilot for the Icarus, delayed the expo so everyone would sleep, me and Janice recruiting another smoothly.</p><p>That was the plan.</p><p>Jin Su went active (living in different timezone) and Gioele also woke up, who has been inactive almost from the start. I couldn't go infect Kuan yet so I waited. And waited. And I'm glad I waited. Long after I got to IB, I saw Eleesha was still silently partolling. Had I went earlier, I would have been spotted and everything planned would have been for naught. I finally converted Kuan Ti after long patience, in the night of D4.</p><p>Doing so exposed us, me and Janice. In the morning Eleesha openly declared that one of us are mush, maybe even both of us. Raluca, secluded from the ship so far joined in Eleeshas hunt. I had no AP, neither did Janice. I finally saw Eleesha entering bridge and began to print the list, and read. To my surprise she left me alone, went back to IB. She went to kill Gioele who happened to be dirty and was on the list as well. She had spent her AP so we were safe for now, although we had to act fast. It seemed she and Raluca were both waiting to recharge AP.</p><p>Janice, with few AP and with the help of Andie infection, transfered into inactive Derek with Shooter and Wrestler. With full AP and an access to blaster, Derek singlehandely killed both Eleesha and Raluca. Our active main threats were finally gone.</p><p><strong>Epilogue</strong> <em>D4-D5</em></p><p>We discussed where to go from now on. It'd certainly be too troublesome to try convert everyone on ship. We landed on trying to set a massive death wave of depression, starting by killing the most morale (active) crew member we knew of. Chun terrified of the slaughter, came to us in confusion and slept among us. All of us shreded Chun to pieces.</p><p>Ian, perhaps still sane, yet not, came alone to us to disturb our well deserved rest, kicking us up from bed. Rest of the "active" crew came around and attacked us disorganized. Overpowered by our experience in warfare, many of them shot themselves to their deaths.</p>

                <p>Janice here. It was a awesome game thx paola for being mine mush partner <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">. About Andie turn it happened a bit diferent. When day changed she was active and asked for relay once again so I rushed int her "aid". Made a private and pmed her "Are you on right now?" she said "Yes I'm on medlab and I can go to the lab". So I ran like a freak to medlab and infected her before she could enter the lab (2 more ap for ian passive in the lab). When I got her I enthusiastically pmed her "Pick up anonymush skill!!!!" and got back the awnser "Well played!" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
