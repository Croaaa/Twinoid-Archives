This was a good ship, it would of been perfect if we had more pilots! (or less hunters, I seriously think RNG was spawning hunters just to kill us). <br>Anyway. We had a crew of 10 1/2 active people! (Chao, Chun, Stephen, Ian, and Possibly inactive Hua).</p><p><strong>The Mush hunt:</strong> Eleesha chose me to be her mush hunting partner since there was no Chun or Chao <em>(Thanks Eleesha! I wanted to be Chun anyway! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> )</em> I assume she trusted me since I completed CSS and ASG with her. The first mush was caught rather quickly... Eleesha said she sent Kuan Ti a "passive aggressive, good cop/bad cop" message after getting dirty loading fuel for an expedition.<br> <br>Kuan Ti did NOT take the joke the right way... and tried to kill Hua <em>(This was not long after Mush selection, so nobody knew she was going to be inactive)</em>. Anyway... To deal with Kuan Ti wearing Armour. We (poorly) organized a stabbing session, with Jin Su, Frieda, and Terrence all notified in 3 different channels. When Terrence was about pick up the knife, Frieda took it to Stab Kuan.</p><p>I'm pretty sure Terrence freaked out at first, until I told him. After Frieda dropped the knife, Jin Su came in to stab KT. Luckily Terrence knew what was happening, so he patiently waited his turn. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> It was a good thing Terrence was last to kill Kuan, because he was still able to launch the expedition we planned on having after stabbing Kuan. (The planet was a bust, though.)</p><p>Now... On to the 2nd mush... Who could of been? Eleesha (and I) thought that one of the other pilots was Mush Since Kuan Ti tried to kill a pilot. She thought it was Terrence, I thought it was Roland. and I suppose we both had our sensible reasons. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I began questioning alot of things... Like, what if Jin Su was not a newish player, and only acting? <em>(he was quiet, but still a good commander)</em> Or maybe Paola is playing sleeper mush? What if... Gioele just entered BD to take a Stealth shower?! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/fear.png" alt=":fear:" class="tid_ico"><br>Well... all of that was wrong... When Frieda found another Cristalite (and Oxygen) planet, I decided we needed Mushovore bacteria at least before we went on the expedition. So I went to lab to Relay... Finola instantly came to help, all good right? Yes.. We finished Mushovore bacteria. Now to work on myco- Wait... Did Finola just extract a spore?! RUUN! At first I was almost certain I would be converted mush after I left the room, but I wasn't and after I told the crew, I began to wonder why Finola would try to convert me <em>after</em> completing Mushovore bacteria? It turns out, it was a mis-click. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I would of killed her then, but there were two things I thought of: She probably has 0 AP and she is in a room with Ian. So instead I asked Raluca (who I wasn't even sure had Genius) to Genius the cure and use it on her. It was a race against time... Would Raluca come online to Cure her, or would she be able to act out her mushy plan? Well, of course, Raluca cures Finola! That's how she won a Nobel Prize. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>The rest of the ship was a bunch of near-death experiences with Hunters and our Hull. We would of died if Raluca was not able to find scrap out of seemingly thin air, that's how she won another Nobel Prize! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> To deal with hunters, I hacked the Terminal because I was able to move us every cycle until our pilots gained enough AP to shoot them down. <em>(Jin Su was a good commander, but no commander is perfect <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> )</em> After hunters were shot down, Raluca, Terrence, and Eleesha (with Tech magebook) were able to finish PILGRED with tons of help from Finola, and Paola. Even though a lot of the crew helped, Raluca took credit and Earned <strong>ANOTHER Nobel Prize</strong>. After PILGRED was complete, most of the crew was ready to go to Sol, so I returned us to Sol.</p><p>Great Job crew and Thank you for not giving up! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Great job on Raluca earning 3 nobel prizes, too. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>(I do not write AP threads often, so Sorry if the formatting makes this hard to read <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> )</em></p>

Gosh! I certaintly didn't expect this at all! Thank you for this great recognition. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"> <br><span class="tid_strike">About time you damn idiots recognise my contribution to the world! I was beginning to think everyone in Sol were all too <strong>jealous </strong>to actually give me a Nobel Prize!</span></p><p>I would like to thank my team, who were great and very cooperative: Eleesha, who did a really good job on the Mush hunt; Janice, who did a splendid job as a stand-in captain and maintaining my morale while I was in dorms; Frieda, who found 2 great Crystalite planets for us; Paola, who did amazing work on comms; and Terrence &amp; Roland, who were on the ball with their piloting duties. <br><span class="tid_strike">Incompetent, lazy-ass, <strong>BUMS </strong>all of them! <em>sigh...</em> I should've just finished my 'Super Cloner' project before coming on board this ship. That way, I could've just cloned 15 copies of myself and then, I wouldn't have to give this stupid 'Thank You' speech!</span></p><p>I'm glad that we managed to fend off the Mushes. Not only that, we even managed to bring one them back to humanity. Finola, I am glad that you are with us again. It would be a terrible loss for all of humanity if we were to lose your research expertise and good-natured spirit to the hands of the Mush. I could only say that I am <strong>truly </strong>honored to lend a hand in helping my team formulate the Retro-fungal Serum in order to save such a talented and wonderful researcher. And now, this serum will be our gift to the world; may it help fight the Mush infection here in Sol, and the rest of the world... U_U<br><span class="tid_strike"><strong>I</strong> made that serum. <strong>Me</strong>! Not '<strong>We</strong>'! Plus, I never should've wasted that serum on Finola in the <strong>first </strong>place! I should've just let that germophobe, cat-hating monster <strong>DIE</strong> for that experiment she did on my poor Schrodie! <em>sigh</em> Why did I have to be so kind &amp; selfless? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> In fact, now that I think about it... they should've awarded me with a Nobel <strong>Peace</strong> Prize just for that!!</span></p><p>As for the abundance of resources on our ship, it is all thanks to our 2 pilots: Roland and Terrence, who worked tirelessly to collect scraps for me to use. If not for their hard work, I would never have managed to save our ship's hull from imminent destruction. <br><span class="tid_strike">Well... I guess that part is true... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/omg.png" alt=":omg:" class="tid_ico"> Most of the scrap metals I used were already there in AB2.
