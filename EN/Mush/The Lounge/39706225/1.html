Your name came up on the list and that, combined with what turned out to be honest mistakes on your part, led to your death.</p><p>However, this game wasn't 100% lost for the humans until Jin Su gave the oh-so bright order for everyone to drop everything and try to kill me(even admitting that he thought I was human)...while the ship had at least 3 fires, a broken o2 tanks and 10 hunters on us. If we had regrouped after you had died, we could have finally finished Natamy and at least taken out Gioele(from the list) and Raluca(who I thought was the second alpha...turns out she was a beta). Then again, I doubt we would have ever found KT, so it was going to be a loss anyway. That Mush Return to Sol was the only thing that saved us from being blown to pieces.</p><p>Huge congratulations to Kuan Ti, even with the language barrier he played a great game, especially with an inactive partner. It was a really good performance on his part, well done to Raluca/Terrence as well.</p>

                <p>Mainly...it was that she honestly didn't know where the O2 tanks were.</p><p>Once upon a time...Jin Su went idle for the day (as usual), but on this particular day he stopped in FC. Paola left the Bridge, then went into Front Storage, back to Front Corridior, then headed to CBS where she got dirty fixing an O2 tank, and finally she stopped for the day in Bravo Dorm. Eventually she returned to the Bridge after day change, where Jin was still standing.</p><p>Given how much she knew about the game, I found it incredibly suspicious that she didn't know where the O2 tanks were, and the fact that her detour would have been her only opportunity to extract a spore and hit Jin if she was Mush was a red flag. On top of that, there was a strange visit by Raluca to FC in between Paola's moves. My conclusion was that Paola and Raluca converted Jin Su; since there were still two Mush on the bar, the easy way to see if I was right was take out Paola, since she would have to be the Anonymush.</p><p>I should also mention that the only reason I even looked into Paola, who up until then had been great, was that her name was on the List. It was her, Terrence(also doing his job), Gioele(inactive) and Hua(dead). Gioele must have miraculously gotten hit with a steel plate on Day 1 or something, because he somehow checked out for 'starvation damage', so it appeared to be 50/50 between her and Terrence and by the time we realized it had been Gioele all along it really didn't matter.</p><p>Turns out the tank detour was a legitimate mistake, and again, I'm sorry Paola <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br>But in my defense, I laid this entire case to Derek a full 10 hours before my attack, and his response was to read it, take it all in, and completely ignore it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> Not a 'I don't buy it', nor a 'Maybe...", just an utterly pointless and generic comment about Mush-hunting that had nothing to do with what I said. What I've learned is that I do really poorly when I have no one to work with, but sometimes the best people around are the ones you suspect!</p>

                <p>I have an habit of asking questions that I could easily find on mushipedia so that the people who don't check mushipedia absorb the knowledge with time. It makes me look stupid, but that is the point. Also I almost always play bridge and lab people. I honestly didn't know about the tanks. I find it flattering that you thought me mush, since I would have been a good mush in that case.</p>
