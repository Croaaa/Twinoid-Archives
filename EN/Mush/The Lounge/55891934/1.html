                <p>Here is how this went from my perspective.</p><p>Day 3: selection happens, me and Raluca are designated to try to bring doom to this ship. Already prior to this there is a mighty row going on between Frieda and Eleesha. Eleesha was, in fact a griefer, and was just insulting everyone left and right. Long story short, the following happens: Eleesha trades for Pilgred on day 3, gets murdered by Roland, drops the knife in bridge.</p><p>Now, the ship is mostly unsecured. Gioele was inactive, mycoalarms are obviously not done.</p><p>Here I have to make a theoretical abstraction. Generally, on ships like this one, when security is lax I prefer to take splashproof and trapper skills and just trap the hell out of everything. The results are something like this: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9874" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9874</a> .</p><p>Buuuut...humans were griefed by Eleesha, there were some inactives, research was as good as nonexistent, Raluca said she would not be available much, so I decided to experiment, because using a lame Pilgred return would have been anything but memorable and while a total mush conversion would be nice, I've been there and done that before.</p><p>I extract two spores, wash and heal myself, as I am the self appointed health checker on the ship and even have logs to see who is full health and who is not. I decide to lay low and see if an opportunity for some creative plays comes along.</p><p>At around the time Eleesha gets killed on bridge I head out there to "check the situation" and both Jin Su and Stephen get slime trapped. I pick up a knife, drop it in Medlab for Chun.</p><p>Parallel to this, I get invited into what will be a mush hunt/kinda human chat. Wonderful!</p><br><p>Day 4: Frieda finds a good planet, Roland goes on a solo expo, but also checks on Raluca in her turret. I spot him in IB and infect him, and tell the human chat I went to see if he's clean, which he was. Not for too long, as I slime trap him, also.</p><p>Roland kills Kuan Ti, who drops a camera. He installs the camera on bridge. He also becomes confirmed and catches...flu, I think? Funnily enough, when the slime trap dirtyness kicks in, he says it's from the disease, which might or not have overlapped.</p><p>Jin Su also gets dirty from the slime trap, but says he ate, and nobody bats an eye. I ask him in public chat where did he eat - he doesn't reply.</p><p>Here is where something curious happens. Humans notice that Stephen is dirty under camera, so they correctly conclude that he was slimetrapped. The suspects are: me, Jin Su, Janice and Roland (he's out since he got confirmed in the meantime). Those are the people that were in the bridge at that time.</p><p>Chun asks me to torture Janice in Medlab. I cannot refuse a dame, so I go there, infect Janice (who is now level 2) and report my torture results: 5 actions, all human, with research participation, cuddling the cat and what not. I have no problem with this report, as I want to pin it on Jin Su, who got dirty and said he ate and get Janice converted ASAP.</p><p>So I paste the report in the human chat and go to sleep.</p><p>I awake to a dead human Janice<img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Turns out there was some discussion, and it was decided that Janice must die. I still have Jin Su as my blame target, so I'm just kind of eating popcorn and watching the blame game.</p><p>At this time, Raluca becomes active. I ask her to just spore the bays, the ER, the fuel lines - anything she can reasonably get her hands on. She also removes a dorm shower (yes, on day 5 <img src="../../../../gfx/square/surprised.png" alt="8D" class="tid_ico">) and she is actually left alone by the humans as she was checked on day 4 by Roland. </p><p>Day 6. Mycoalarms get done. Another planet is found. A whole bunch of people pick up random spores. Roland is at level 2. Frieda eats a spore in AB or AB2 (I was actually online at the time of her doing that and my butt clenched as I thought she would see Raluca moving haphazardly). Hua also eats a spore and is at level 2.</p><p>Jin Su announces that he will load fuel and get an expo going. He had a stater spore, and ER was trapped, and obviously I want him converted. Both me and Raluca are online, and we refresh quite often. We both get unlucky, as he is super fast on the fuel loading and ship movement thing. I was refreshing every 10 seconds, and despite him eating an ER spore, I am too slow to catch him.</p><p>His problem is that he is still dirty, and in the chat there is some talk about him and me, since we are now the top subjects. Jin Su stayed dirty for several hours, though, and goes past BD and washes without telling anybody. This is enough for Roland to be convinced that Jin Su must die <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I chase after him in the corridors, hoping to get him converted and *then* kill Jin Su. I am too slow. He kills the human Jin Su. The chat kind of explodes, hua starts fuming (rightly so) and it's generally a massive chaos <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"> Funnily enough, Roland actually killed two people that were 1 spore away from being mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink2.png" alt=":wink:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Realizing that I am now left as the only suspect, I remove the camera on Bridge and convert Roland.</p><p>In chat, Roland smartly announces that I spiked Stephen and begins some devilishly clever social manipulation. The plan was to get Hua to go to AB and pick up a "blaster" that was hidden, so that Roland can kill me on bridge with his shooter points. All that so that she eats a spore from AB previously trapped by Raluca. Hua literally hates Roland at this point and it takes some time. The exchange is quite popcorn worthy in the chat, and Hua does as Roland asks, but the bay was cleared by Chun, who installed a mycoalarm before<img src="../../../../gfx/square/mad.png" alt="X[" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Also in the meantime, for whatever reason, Roland takes anonymush, even though I took it for him and gave him a pretty damn good cover!</p><p>I decide for a transfer. I have the "boring" option into transferring into the inactive Gioele, taking solid, activating phagocyte (It's day 7 by now) and just murdering half the crew. Or I have the fun option of transferring into Hua, killing the "griefer" Chao and seeing if humans buy the story <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink2.png" alt=":wink:" class="tid_ico"> So I pick up the cat like 30 times, get myself down to 3 HP and go to dorms to transfer into Hua. I am shocked to discover upon the transfer that Hua has 0 Ap and 2 mp<img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> . There is no way for me to kill her off!!</p><p>Stephen heads to the dorm, and correctly reads the situation: Chao has no skills, and there is a Hua and an inactive Gioele in the dorm. Logic says that I would've transferred into Gioele to rampage, but Stephen correctly guesses that I took Huas' body and slams my head against the wall. I die. hat off to you Stephen, that was really well done.</p><p>Later on, I stuck around in the death screen to see that Roland got caught as mush when he extracted in FC under a camera that I stole from Bridge and installed there <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The humans then figure out Raluca for the last mush, kill her and come home.</p><p>All in all, I hope it was a fun ship for everyone, with some good mushy paranoia going around and some memorable moments despite the inactives and griefers.</p>

                <p>Ok now it's time for Granny Frieda's side of the story.</p><br><p>I was the last one to wake up so I found the Mush Sample and all like the good little human I was. I do my thing around, message Chun (this was to become the "mush hunt chat" ) and then mve to B Dorm to get some AP back. Meanwhile, Roland takes the knife and armor in the Lab for Chun and messages me saying that Eleesha picked Observant over Tracker and took the Grenade I had dropped in the Lab for Chun. So I confront her openly and boy did she absolutely explode. Every time I said anything, she would insult the life out of me. It was absolutely hilarious and I was really determined to kill her should she fuck up the comms work (which she did). So anyways, I got to bed at one point and come back to a finished PILGRED and a dead Eleesha. Sadly, she was human.</p><p>Sometime during the timeframe of my argument with Eleesha, Chao and Hua both said they needed to privately talk to Chun. So I dragged them both into the chat I started with Chun and Roland was added to. All in all, I soon noticed that Roland was very impatient and trigger-happy so to speak. At the time of Janice's trip to the Bridge and Stephen's dirtiness kicking in from Slimetrapping, I too was among Roland's suspects and it took him quite a bunch of days to finally believe I wasn't Mush.</p><p>Then Jin dies (I dealt the killing blow mainly because I was pretty much fed up with how hasty Roland was being and because Jin was pretty darn suspicious. Meanwhile, Chao "pleads" for us to wait for Chun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> ) and Roland concludes that Chao is Mush so an "angry" Chao runs to the Bridge and converts Roland who immediately assumed his Mush role and then kept acting hasty and angry or whatever it was. At that point I had no AP/MP left ad I honestly didn't care who was Mush anymore. All I know is that both Roland and Chao taking Anonymush revealed Raluca as the 3rd Mush to me.</p><p>I then spent the next couple of cycles announcig that Raluca was Mush, saying that Stephen, Roland and Ian were all equally at risk of having been converted, openly calling Stephen and Ian mushes and overall just waiting for Chao to take us to Sol since I coudn't eat and didn't have AP/MP or a weapon to try and kill anybody.</p><p>Soon after, Stephen came back, killed the transfered Chao which proved me he wasn't Mush. Then Ian came on and said he wasn't Mush either so that left Roland (who funnily enough tried to pin the blame on me as well for a second there and even dragged me into private chats &amp; whatnot, trying to act human). I then joined Stephen in B Dorm and got my Coprolalia cured (which I had got from witnessing Jin's death) and waited to get some AP back. Meanwhile, Hua comes back in Chao's body and swiftly investigates. Catches Roland's sporing in CC where the camera was (not FC like Chao remembered <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> )and then checked the Bridge to confirm the conversion from the morale gain logs. Roland was swiftly eliminated and although I claimed Raluca was the last Mush, Chun who returned from a prolonged absence wasn't convinced. So we waited until she saw Finola taking starvation damage and I ended Paola's suffering (took like 1 hit). Gioele got Quarantined by NERON and that left us with Chun, myself, Stephen and Hua/Chao confirmed, Ian and Raluca. So Chun killed Raluca and we called for a Sol return.</p><p>Since Hua/Chao couldn't do it when we wanted it (due to lack of AP most likely), I tried my luck with the hacker kit (had no more, no less than 5AP and got lucky to hack in from the 1st try) and took us to Sol.</p>

It made for a fun ship in site of all the crap we had t go through. It was the first time I saw Slimetrap being used and I really think i learned a few things from this ship, all thanks to you. Now, I haven't been Mush in forever but I'll certainly give your strategy a try sometimes.</p>

Most of the story were told by Chao and Frieda players already, so I just add some of my vision, missed parts, or the moments they had no chance to see.</p><p>First of all, I was frustrated with all those kills made by Roland no words to describe how. Stephen called the crew for help with sighal, and voila, Janice got killed. We were discussing about opportunities for Mushes to finish this game on a spot, if Jin Su is actually a Mush, but still.... bang! He's got killed too. At this point I was sure that mushes making fun of us. Kuan Ti was inactive so I dont bother about killing him, but it was Roland again, so I started to boil. Last two of my ships were wrecked by hunters, so my first priority in this game was to keep the hull at maximum for as long as I can. And I was periodically triggered by Roland wasting his pilot's actions on humans.</p><p>First part of the story will about Frieda. It was already after I became Chao. I had 3 hp, starvation, and no points to move or act. Well, at least I survived body swap, but I'll talk about it later. All the time of messing with Roland and Raluca I spend healing, eating, trying to find talkie and sending orders. Stephen, with help from Chun, actually done all the work. He contacted base wth neuro-sync, making me able to talk not only from bridge, he finished Roland or Raluca. As far as I remember, he killed my former body. So. <br>Whats about Fireda, you willing to ask? It was after killing Roland, but we were not sure about second mush. AND, we were not sure about granny not being converted. Funny enough, Frieda pointed at almost everybody on the ship, calling them mushes, except for Chao, who actually was a mush. So we suspected her hardly, and even discussed about how and when we are going to kill her. But I took a timeout for thinking about timings and messages, and found that she were confirmed human before, and actually suggested Raluca as mush after camera were removed and all that converison mess on a bridge happened. This only post helped her survive heavy fists of Stephen. We were not sure untill the very end, but she acted smart and we chosed just to belive her.</p><p>The next story is about my screws. I always try to play in role and on in-game-world things, at least as my non-native engrish lets me. But some times became so desperade so I have to withdraw my principles and just play for result. Its kinda bad metagaming, and Im not happy about doing so, but it still part of a story. I have two episodes for you to tell. <br>First one, is when I had body swapped. Couple cycles before bridge mess, we were atacked by some hunters. I spent everything to clean the space, discussed about Jin Su strange acts and moved away from checking game. Im still hope that its not my words forced Roland to kill Jin, but whatever. Bridge mess were happening, I conflicted with Roland about his non-willing to play smart game with non massacring mushes, failed to find Blaster, etc, etc. Chao came for me, body swapped, picked my only skill and pretend that's nothing happen. I wasnt silver and hadnt Torturer skill to pick it like former Chao, but I chosed not to pick any skill at all, so I will have a chance to survive, if anyone will check my new body for skills he had. And this actually worked. Good guy Stephen checked me, and let me survive. Yeah, this sounds mediocre at best.<br>The second one was about converting Roland. Its told a bit by Orianna, but I'll tell you more. So. I was Chao already, my hunger was gone, my health were fixed a bit, but still no talkie, so I stuck on a bridge, planning to make the communications from there. Here I ckecked the logs, and saw former Chao's acts, like spiking Roland and accquiring 8 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico">. I moved to wikia immidiately and found that 8 glory is given to mush for converting someone. Roland spiked, Glory given, nearest actions in logs, you got the idea? So I raised the hype against Roland. Meh. I moved TWICE through Central Corridor, with big red message about Roland extracting spore, but I didint saw it at all. The reason we killed Roland is only my log reading. Thats bad reason. Yeah, I found message with extracting after Roland were dead, but it still feeling so wrong to me.</p><p>On the other hand, with all the mess were done by Roland, Im was so happy sending people for his head. Gorgerous game for mushes, had so maty things to feel, no matter was it joy or frustration. Just wondering why our inactive Paola were not converted? She stayed in Nexus all the time without any protection. If her death showed us that she was mush, thats messed our suggestions about many of things.<br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8797719 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8797719">pyro__maniac</span></span><cite><br>It sounds like a "kill all unproven people before returning to Sol"-strategy. Not very fair and maybe reportable.</cite><br>We have to go home, but before, we have to find out who's the last one. It was my, "peacefull" idea that second mush may be the inactive one, so after one of the three inactives died from stavation, and second one expoded into messy flesh pile, killing (or at least hurting) the third one to find where the humanity last known enemy is fine "in-game" thing to me. And as I said, if only Paola were converted, and Raluca got anonymush, things would be much MORE complicated for us.</p><p>Anyway, it was good game for every active person aboard, except for griefy Eleesha.<br>Janice, Jin Su, you have been avenged. Chun, Stephen, Frieda. We are going home.</p>
