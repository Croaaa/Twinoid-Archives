                <p>Attention worms and maggots, this is Chao speaking!</p><p>Eden just received a bunch of new residents! This includes Chao the amazing interviewer, Finola the artistic knife gutter, and a bunch of mechanical drones awaiting to be upgraded to do surgeries with spoons and forks. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Oh there are others, too, like Eleesha and Stephen, you know, but I've already interviewed them on the ship, so they'll get a break for a year to heal up. Don't worry guys, I'll get around to you again soon! Remember to let me know if you prefer fire or acid! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7283" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7283</a></p><p>Mush hunt was relatively simple, especially since they were so eager to reveal themselves while you push cigarrette butts into their exposed kidneys! We swiftly made beautiful body art decorations of them, though... hanging strips of Frieda artfully over the astro terminal, or making a Picasso impression of Gioele in the middle of rear corridor.</p><p>There was the mush cure, too, that Raluca geniused some time before she got herself killed because apparently her brain was too small to remember simple things like Alien Planet directions. However we jabbed the cure into the wrong person. Oops. Looks like we had no choice but to gut Frieda. Totally not intentional at all! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Oh, look, my next interviewee has just walked in into my new Eden dungeon. I need to go sharpen my fountain pen for a minute, while the others post their accounts. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

It was a lot of fun finally seeing a bit of the Chao/Finola interaction I've always wanted. So very sad that RP died off a few days in - I wanted so badly to play out Finola's threats against Chao! But I get it. Life got to some people, and losing Terrence, Frieda and Raluca hit player morale pretty hard. Then Jin Su's suicide, Ian's .... griefing? Would love to know what was going on in his head. And Chun killing herself after reading the pilot book, leaving us with two barely active pilots, one of whom never once spoke or used the lenses.</p><p>Whew! Can see how RP got pushed onto the backburner with focus on keeping everything going. I was pretty hard pressed to keep everyone alive at times. Triage, indeed!</p><p>And then.... Eden!

                <p>You made it! Good. I started to get really worried when our active and engaged crew members were falling one by one.</p><p>Raluca here. I'd like to start by saying that after a long string of barely-active ships and struggling to get even back to Sol, this ship was a breath of fresh air. Even aside from the beautiful roleplay interactions, having things get fixed even when I was offline! I can only hope this doesn't spoil me.</p><p><strong>A summary for those who weren't with us:</strong> The ship started on D1C1 and filled fairly quickly, for a random ship. By the time I checked in again D1C6, the mush had been selected and the sample already found. There wasn't much more I could do as Raluca until we had a good project or scrap metal, so I took care of a few chores: making sure cameras were placed, relaying lab research, and helping with the Sol connection. Satisfied with my contribution, I retired to my turret.</p><p>Two cycles later, I was dirty.</p><p>When I saw that, I panicked. I didn't know how I could have gotten dirty, especially since the last two things I had done were work on projects and the connection to Sol. Then I remembered that slime trap was a thing. I thought about claiming I got dirty working on Pilgred, or even showering secretly, then working in PMs with anybody I thought I could trust while the mush went unsuspecting. In the end, I decided that what they wanted was a visible suspect that was not them. Fine, I decided, and gave them a show. I reported my dirtiness and lack of cause in the dirty thread, and waited for the expected "interview" with acting-Commander Chao. It was not long in coming, and thanks to help from Janice, I knew exactly what I could use to prove my innocence in the matter. Chao didn't even torture me, because my innocence was clear.</p><p>However, we played along. Chao ordered me into quarantine until he had the energy to arrange a few tests for my truthfulness- aside from a mandate to get clean, where I secretly checked the Bravo Dorm logs and passed them along. And when the torture session happened, it was not me that was the victim, but Gioele... the one person I had been in a room with no camera (He installed the camera in the lab while I was researching.) And lo and behold, the Slime Trap action was among his last few. A great and daring play, mush friend, and on any other ship it would have worked. It still might have if I had acted differently, or not known what to report.</p><p>One mush down, and we had a group to work with for hunting the other. Myself, because it would be pointless for a mush to slime trap his partner, and poor play for me to give evidence that ratted my partner out when he was not under suspicion. Chao and Finola, as those who killed Gioele once he was discovered, and Chun. We had a few suspects already: Terrence had entered the medlab where Paola and Frieda were while dirty to fix a door. Ian appeared to be a silent roamer, though he could be prodded into talking in chat. Stephen appeared to be brand new, perhaps fake? Eleesha was remarkably silent. And despite Kuan being active in chat, he had yet to spend any AP - even after complaining on the lack of research progress and being asked to help.</p><p>Our Jin then committed suicide. He'd been silent before, but had given speeches in the dorms. Maybe he wasn't up for a ship as chatty as ours was proving to be. Regardless of his reasoning, he picked up and dropped the cat until he took a claw to the jugular. One human dead.</p><p>The mush hunting chat was eager to take down our second mush quickly, and a little nervous. With several suspects that had ample opportunity to make our lives difficult should they even think they were about to be found, we didn't want to give them a chance. Suspicions hovered for a while, with a few illnesses and other circumstances clearing names, and we decided that our top two suspects were Kuan Ti and Terrence. Both were (apparently) experienced players, and had either made mistakes or had contributed almost nothing. So we hatched a plan. As Raluca, I activated gold mode while Chao interrogated KT. We found.... nothing. Exactly why we suspected him in the first place, we could account for every action he had taken and found only one action that had cost actual AP. And yet he had been taking a bed, in the dorm where Janice was. We decided to put the plan into action. I took genius and finished the cure, carefully carried it to the dorm, and stuck Kuan Ti with it.</p><p>The mush did not disappear from the crew bar. We were wrong. It wasn't Kuan Ti.</p><p>((Continued, because so many words.))</p>

XD<br>Sorry about that btw, I hope my self righteous Finola RP didn't mix too much and make people feel bad there. It was a reasonable decision and although I voiced doubts, it's not like I actually objected to it. Chao and I talked some later and tried to figure out why he thought he was mush and I didn't - we're both very experienced and competent mush hunters. We came to the conclusion that I'm more likely to assume incompetent human, he's more likely to assume mush, and either can backfire depending on the situation. Kuan Ti's last words made me feel better at keeping him alive, even if I did miss Frieda terribly.</p>

                <p>With his humanity confirmed, but the hunting team's morale low, we added KT to the hunt PM. (He apologized for the lack of activity, owing to Real Life circumstances, and made a better effort to help after that. It was appreciated, by me at least.) We had lost the ability to cure the other mush, which was a big disappointment when all the other possible suspects were people we would like to keep.</p><p>So, we went on an expo. Rather Chao did, and specifically called on unproven crew members to attend. The idea was to examine them afterwards, when accidents and fatigue would make them reveal more than they normally would. Terrence immediately got lost. Then was found. Then got lost again, and this time was found dead. Our other suspect.... but he was human. I quietly threw up my hands and figured the mush would reveal themselves when they were ready, and all we could do was keep pressing forward.</p><p>Chao, on the other hand, acted. The expo had gone extremely poorly, enough to suspect a traitor. So he held the medkit and pretended to go to sleep, preventing heals. And then, the interviews began. Janice was spared, because he talked to pilot Frieda first. The expo was the first chance she'd had to get dirty, and she had taken the chance to pull a spore before she showered. Mush 2 dead.</p><p>The rest of the journey was not so easy. Kuan Ti switched priority to Astrophysicist, since his second skill had not been chosen. Eleesha read the mage book on planet finding to help. Chao and Janice kept each other's morale up, and I set to work on Pilgred, to get us our coffee to help with planet scans. Our biggest difficulty was lack of pilots. Hua and Roland rarely (if ever spoke) and seemed to only check in once in a while. Chun took the starting Pilot mage book and Lethargy, hoping to become a flying machine.</p><p>Ian had been roaming the ship, failing to report garden work, fixing unimportant breaks and eating to fuel these repairs. He'd been warned, but he was also a confirmed human. Plus, he was Ian, very annoying and energy intensive to kill. Still, food was very limited because he refused to comply. So we found another planet, to get oxygen and bring back food. A bonus, it had aliens that might give us star map pieces.</p><p>This expo went nearly as poorly as the first. I got lost. Chao got lost. Accidents all over the place. And when we returned without Chao and relaunched to find him, Chun healed those who had been hurt, but didn't fix herself. And then she took two 5hp accidents in a row. Rest in peace, Last Hope, and pray we can manage with only the two pilots.</p><p>We did, for a while. Hua was more responsive than Roland, and we had plenty of scrap. I fixed Pilgred, and we got and finished Plasma Shields with a few food-binge-fueled pushes. Another expo netted us a precious jumpkin plant, and with Heat Lamps in the garden, it was only a matter of time until we had a bumper bumpjumpkin crop to compliment the coffee. Chao commanded like he was born to it.</p><p>Then, disaster. The jumpkin was placed in the garden on C8, since it would mature for day change. And not ten minutes later, Ian cheerfully reported the plants cared for and watered, and that the new banana plant was doing fine. He had deliberately killed the jumpkin by trying to turn it back into a banana while dirty, then planted another banana in its place.</p><p>That was the last straw. Another dead human, and more reports to the SDF. Very frustrated, we continued our search for Eden, only slightly mollified by the star map fragment we obtained. And the next expo, we found piece two. But I was lost. And when they found me in the snow where I had curled up, it was too late.</p><p>The rest of the story must be told by someone there, but I quite enjoyed my trip despite the... difficulties. Special thanks to Chao, Finola, and Janice for being the RP core on the ship, but I appreciated everyone who wasn't a quitter or griefer. Even Gioele, that was a gutsy move.</p><p>Hope to play with you again!</p>

                <p>So here's the mushy medium of the cosmos (Man I should use that again, it was fun!) Freida, with the mush side of how things went down!<br>Blah blah blah, joining a ship, find out it's a cool roleplay one, woo! I go to bed in real life, thinking, man, I hope I don't get mush on this ship.<br>Of course I did.<br>So luckily enough my partner was active... Kinda.<br>If you notice he didn't say much in the main chat. He was only slightly kore active in the mush chat. By the time he'd told me that he slime trapped Raluca you guys had already finished two or three researches. He never talked again. After that there was nothing much I could do, because I had no reason to get dirty. Until the expo. Luckily enough Terrence somehow got lost twice and got himself killed. That was completely his fault. I was silver with an empty slot and fertile. So I got dirty, pulled a spore on the way to the shower, got splashproof (regretting that I couldn't risk a damaging shower and take defacer or something, not that it would have mattered), went to the bridge to soak up logistics, and woke up dead.<br>Really I started to suspect something when Chao PM'D me asking if I needed healing. I did, actually, after getting mauled by a something-or-other once or twice on the expo. But really I was out of any significant number of points after the expo.</p>

                <p>Haha yeah 1412, I PM-ed you about your HP (under the guise of "do you need healing" ) because I wanted to plan out our torture session. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>While I was kinda glad it was you who's mush and not Janice (since we really needed the Shrink), I was really sad to lose the Clairvoyant Frieda!! It was the most entertaining Frieda RP I've seen in awhile. It's too bad you couldn't do more on it.</p><p>Isidarth, excellent call on telling the truth and the whole truth about getting dirty! That made hunting a lot easier, and it made me trust you almost right away. I did consider for a minute that you might be doing some crazy mastermind stuff, but that would require you to be insane. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Glad you were one of us after all!</p><p>Real sad to lose you in another MIA, though. We lost so many actives in freak expo accidents, it's a miracle we made it to Eden. Guess the good luck balanced out the bad.</p><p>Our last planet had 3x Shipwrecks, 1x Cristalite and 1x Seismic! We got mush trap in Cristalite, but luckily our 3rd map shard was in a Shipwreck. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Oh! Hi there, Eleesha reporting!</p><p>I'm not the RP player, but I usually like reading other's RP. In this case though, I was (and I'm still) very busy IRL, so I skipped much of it (also, I'm a native French speaker, so it's a bit harder for me to play RP in English, but even in French, I can't play RP more than 2 days).<br>But this ship was great. I enjoyed it very much. I'm glad I've been there and that I could prove myself useful, even with my busy schedules, my not-so-good abilities at investigation (a shame for an Eleesha, I know) and everything.</p><p>Thanks all and hope to meet you again! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
