                <p>Thought I'd wait to see if anyone else started an AP, but guess I'll do it. (I did suggest the title anyway) I'm not really good at recapping though (this has become surprisingly long though...despite that I'm missing some stuff.)... I was <strong>Finola</strong>.</p><p>The ship started off with <strong>Paola</strong> posting a rude link before she went silent for almost the entire rest of the ship. Early speculation about her being a griefer was established as I had seen a camera log about her picking up the apron and it wasn't until day 2 that it showed up in the lab. Luckily all the research I'd done on the first day I didn't get dirty. The soap was nowhere to be found either.</p><p>Then on day 2...<br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_6826491 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="6826491">Spazticus</span></span><cite><br>A bug on Day 2 wiped out all of our rations. There was a camera in the room, and just a few cycles later, 30 rations were just...gone. They couldn't have been cooked, taken, or hidden. (I did already post about it in the Bugs thread, but that's a fail through no fault of anyone on the ship.) Murphy's Law seems to be in effect on this ship, in a way that not even our Mush could have taken credit for...</cite><br>So we knew we had to get to a planet quickly just so we'd have food (as opposed to the usual first requirement for a planet, food). So we get a planet, we get to the planet... We go on an expedition! <em>10% chance of pump failure</em> on the O2 zone... Bummer, but we got 4 fruit and 4 steaks (which were thrown in the freezer <strong>Stephen</strong> moved to the IB), and we weren't horrible need of O2 yet. Plenty of time to get it on the next planet.</p><p>So we need to leave orbit, <strong>Ian</strong> puts fuel in the tank, says it's ready to go. <strong>Hua</strong> posts that she had taken a patrol ship out and can't get back yet so not to leave yet. <strong>Jin Su</strong> sends the ship out of orbit and we lose our <em>only</em> pilot.</p><p>... I'm actually blanking on exactly just what happened with <strong>Jin Su</strong> after that before he was outted as a Mush and killed... Revealing that he had taken AnonyMush, and that there are at least 3 Mush on board by this point.</p><p>And <strong>Paola</strong> was also taken out, but as it turned out she was just a griefer and wasn't a mush.</p><p>Anyway, we got the MycoAlarms researched. (okay, recalling a bit more, like <strong>Jin Su</strong> moving one of the alarms, but don't remember the rest aside from a conversation about mush.) I moved one of the MycoAlarms from the lab to the MedLab (just dropped it, didn't hide it) where a few of us were. They left sometime after that. I decided to lay down on the bed, since while there wasn't a camera there, there was an alarm, and anybody who picked it up would be suspicious.</p><p>I check back on the game, look in the actions in the room... 6 minutes prior, <strong>Raluca</strong> had entered the MedLab. Which is suspicious since she really has no reason to go anywhere more towards the front of the ship than the central corridor (since it leads to the Refectory). But not nearly as suspicious or condemning as the <em>BRRRRIIIIINGGGG...</em> that went off right before she left. She didn't even notice the alarm before sporing me. (in her defense, there were still a lot of pills even if she looked at the shelving unit first) I promptly inform the rest of her Mush status and they take care of her.</p><p>It's day 4. We are really starting to get low on oxygen though, so we need to get to a new planet ASAP. <strong>Gioele</strong> and Frieda both provide planets with O2, <strong>Gioele</strong>'s with 2 unknowns, and <strong>Frieda</strong>'s fully analyzed (nothing truely disastrous). We go with <strong>Frieda</strong>'s. <strong>Chao</strong> gets back on before we have newbie <strong>Chun</strong> use the hacker kit on the bridge (<strong>Chao</strong> wasn't that inactive, so I'm not quite sure why that was being pressed for since it can take a lot of AP to successfully use the hacker kit.) and we are off to the planet.</p><p>We get to the planet, start an expedition, and before I know what's happening, <strong>Stephen</strong> is shouting that <strong>Frieda</strong> is a Mush. As she had said there were too oceanic zones, where as there was only 1 and the other was actually a <em>volcanic zone</em>. So four of us (<strong>Finola</strong> (Me), <strong>Stephen</strong>, <strong>Ian</strong>, and <strong>Chao</strong>) are stuck on the expedition while <strong>Gioele</strong> goes after <strong>Frieda</strong> in the Bravo Dorm. In the middle of <strong>Gioele</strong> attacking <strong>Frieda</strong>, for no reason <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> starts attacking <strong>Gioele</strong> down to 1 health.</p><p>Meanwhile on the expedition, <em>FATIGUE EVERYWHERE</em>. First there was an accident on landing (<strong>Stephen</strong>), then there was an accident with predators(<strong>Chao</strong>), then 3-4 zones fatigued us. Everything chipping away at our health (Chao got down to 1 HP). We hit the volcano.... Thankfully nothing happened. But before we get back <strong>Stephen</strong> gets <em>lost</em>.</p><p>I run to the Lab to grab the Medikit (luckily I was full on AP), and run back to the Bravo Bay to heal <strong>Gioele</strong> and then back to the IB and heal myself and <strong>Chao</strong>. We quickly go back down to the planet (we still had 4 zones, including O2). We find <strong>Stephen</strong> and some fuel. We get to the O2 zone... And... Yeah... <em>10% chance of pump getting jammed</em>... again... Well, that sucks, we had only a few O2 left.</p><p>We get back to the ship, I heal <strong>Stephen</strong>, and they go off and finish off Mush <strong>Frieda</strong> and <strong>Kuan Ti</strong>. I go grab fuel to put in the combustion chamber so we can escape the 12 hunters on our tail and hopefully maybe be able to get to a new planet... I for no particularly sound reason, check the fuel level before putting fuel in... I get dirty. I have 0 AP and 0 MP and am in the engine room... I also seem to have caught a cold from the expedition (which has a chance of eating my AP). And after they killed the Mush, I was down to 5 morale... Luckily <strong>Chao</strong> still had his mission to assign and gave it to me so I could get to the bravo dorm where <strong>Janice</strong> was and still have enough AP to take a shower. The cold was healed the next cycle too.</p><p>Janice comforted me for some more morale. On cycle 8 (which I was up really late to actually be awake at cycle 8...) I went to check the plants just in case to see if they were diseased, since we needed the O2 they'd give us next cycle (Day 5). Inactive <strong>Roland</strong> had just died that cycle from lack of oxygen. I head to bed. I wake up the next day, check MUSH, and find... I died the very next cycle after I went to bed. Apparently inactive <strong>Eleesha</strong> got back on just in time to send me to O2 deprivation instead of her... Aside from <strong>Stephen</strong> being the next to go, I don't know what happened after that. XD</p><p>And we still never found the soap or the drill...</p>

                <p>But a cool story. I personally doubt the 10% chance of a jammed pump. We had also bad luck on our first two oxygen planets. But could alse be my bad karma <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hey, <strong>Giole </strong>here! Thanks for the accurate and extensive recap (a minor correction - the second analysed planet was actually not mine, but Ian's).</p><p>I enjoyed this flight a lot, the odds were against us the whole time but since nearly all players were active (including the mush), it was both fun and challenging. I tried to concentrate on mush hunting and this was first time I encountered such a smart and active mush team - I sure learned a lot. Unfortunately I was wrong in most of my assumptions, but at least I trusted only actual human crew <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Ow and I feel bit sorry for Frieda and Raluca, they seemed nice players too.. sucks to be converted <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And shame Hua was abandoned, but at least it led to Jin Su getting uncovered (even though it was all by accident) <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Paola started off our game with a rude link, as noted. She got reported for that, as well. Then she went mostly silent for the rest of the voyage, wandering around the ship randomly, and not being very communicative or helpful. She finished one, maybe two projects from the bridge, but did little else of value. She held and moved items without any logical reason (and of course told nobody where they ended up),</p><p>At one point, she took up a spot in Icarus Bay for hours, greatly delaying our attempt at an expo. Of course, she just stood there, didn't gear up at all, and it prevented Ian from getting into the room. I clearly recall threatening to remove her by force, and she finally left, a cycle or two later. We did eventually kill her, but her actions <em>seemed</em> so Mush-like, we were surprised that she was human and griefing.</p><p>As for Jin Su: The first thing that tipped me off was that he'd picked up one of the Mycoalarms. Normally that's a Chun-only job, but he announced openly that he hid it on the Bridge, which just seemed more than a little "off" to me. Actually, it seemed more likely that he did it so we'd get a false sense of security, about it, and the ploy failed miserably. I called him out for that, and he then said he was moving it back. But his biggest error was moving the ship and leaving Hua behind. It was literally the <strong>top post</strong> at the time he moved the ship, stating she was going to kill hunters, and to not leave without her. After that point, I called for his death.</p><p>And Frieda? I was certain she was Mush when we were on that expo, and to my horror, we don't have two oceanic zones, but one oceanic and a volcano zone among the rest. The moment I saw that, I declared her to be Mush, but I got lost on the expo. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> I had no intention of suicide, but I feared what Frieda might do on the ship if the team returned to get me. I told the crew to kill her first, <em>then</em> worry about getting me, heh.</p>
