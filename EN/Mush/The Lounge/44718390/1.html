                <p>Mush Gioele <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/gioele.png" alt=":mush_gioele_50:" class="tid_ico"> from <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6854">this ship</a>.</p><p>I'm not really sure, how many of the players from this ship are visiting forum or even discussing here, but well...</p><p>It was about to be one of the ships of coordinated TE jump but as it happened there weren't much TE members. I know only about me and Paola. Maybe Hua. Others all joined before our jump so I guess there are no members amongst them.<br>This said, I was kinda disappointed at first by the absence of my fellow groupmates. But boy, how I enjoyed it in the end, after all.</p><p>Mushes were chosen the cycle I joined. And as I feared, of all my ships in last several months it had to be the one where I'm playing lvl 3 golden Gioele when I have to be chosen mush. And with Paola as partner.<br>At first, it looked really bad. I was able to extract some spores and put one on Jin Su before installing one of my cameras on bridge but that was all for first day. And it didn't look to get any better for next days. I was just condemned to do a generalist work as ineffectively as possible without being suspicious.</p><p>Luckily, there was surprisingly lot of humans who were suspicious enough themselves. I'd like to thank to all those who took my coffee so I didn't needed to explain my lack of APs to much. Ian and Jin Su were just semi-active and if they were doing anything useful, they were not communicating it clearly enough, so no one knew. Stephen visited bravo dorm few times without any reason (there wasn't even free bed there), people were moving things to most strange locations, even discussing a construction of sofa in refectory, because our inactive Janice ended her tutorial there. And of course, there were five inactives, three of them not even finished tutorial.<br>In this company, I was probably looking so useful, that I was pretty quickly invited to a mush hunt thread, where I was able to a) watch if Paola is suspect (since she really didn't do much and not even touched Xyloph), b) sway public opinion to other suspects. Which I was probably doing right, because nobody even winked when I relayed Pilgred to spore trap Raluca, getting it on 50% at the start of day 4 with both mushes still alive.<br>Instead, I was ordered by Chun to kill poor Stephen who was allegedly warned about entering bravo dorm but still did so.</p><p>And that is, when it all escalated pretty quickly. Roland called me out about my AP usage and I was getting ready for fight, just trying to buy some time with excuses. But he backed off almost immediately, killing inactives instead. Since Janice died in the process and Jin Su wasn't doing anything, morale started to be a problem. And when Jin Su started doing anything, it was killing of Ian resulting in Raluca's death due to low morale.<br>At that moment, we were considering rampage with Paola. With Raluca dead, Hua being only remaining technician and day change in four cycles, there wasn't much chance to rush Pilgred and go for Sol infiltration, so rampage it was.<br>We were about to wait one cycle to get some more APs, but Kuan Ti decided to try to kill me before that. Luckily, he didn't pick up the knife lying on the shelf just in our dorm, so he was able to get me down to just 1 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> before I refreshed, picked the knife and killed him. Then, there was no reason to wait any longer and risk someone else's attack, so I killed Roland and Hua in another dorm with grenade and knife and Paola shot down Chun and Andie. We weren't able to finish Jin Su, but he died of low morale just at the cycle change, leaving the ship just for two mushes and Schr√∂dinger.</p><p>I'm feeling kinda sorry for those humans. There were several good active players there (namely especially Chun, Roland, Hua, maybe few others) but it seemed to me like they let themselves to be manipulated too easily and had huge blind spots when it comes to some things like Paola not having any progress on comms, knives lying around on shelves, useful things being picked up and never ever returned (I holded scooter for almost whole game and no one even asked about it), huge chunks of APs disappearing (I was lying in the bed whole game and reported doing like two things per day max) and so.<br>So guys, if anyone of you is reading this, please don't take that defeat personally. This time, it was just my job to lie to you, to look like I'm offline a lot (which I wasn't) and to kill you. Next time, I'd really like to be a useful crewmember.</p><p>Thanks a lot, especially to Paola for being a great partner.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/journal/v/452">And here's some nrj</a>.</p>
