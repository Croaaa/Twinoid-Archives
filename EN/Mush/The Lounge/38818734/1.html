                <p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4270" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4270</a><br>Hey Stephen here posting just before the ship is void of life due to oxygen loss, I had pretty solid plans to use the fungal kitchen skill on some coffee but Paola was stealing it from me. Hua my Mush brethren was killed to the fact that she lied about how many shots she did while piloting and spored, Paola found out how many times she shot and then Jin Su killed her. I insisted that she went out on that cycle so we wouldn't be limited on spores. Shortly before Hua's death I infected Jin Su in the Nexus with a spore in case I had a chance to transfer into him to return to Sol or go on a rampage with him.</p><p>The next day when we went to go do some research I think, Jin Su was stood in front corridor and since I had a spare spore over the time that I had been sporing, I infected him again. By now people were probably suspicious of me and I had the transfer skill ready on me in case of being attacked. Eleesha was killed since the details of the food in the refectory was shown on astropad and the last person to update it was Eleesha, the rest of the crew had the idea that she was Mush and Mush can see what things have, I had previously updated it while I had the Chef skill. I now confirm that if you are Mush, astropad does not update pills or food, unless you have the required skills. <br> <br>The day after I infected Jin I was pretty starved of AP since I had to chill with Ian in the Medlab for a bit, I went to a dorm around cycle 6 and tried to save up all the AP I could so I could have a better chance at converting Jin Su. At cycle 8 me, Ian and Jin Su went to go research since it was day 5 and we only had anti-spore gas researched. After we all had relayed I lied about how much AP I had since I was saving at least 1AP to be able to infect Jin. There was no camera in the Laboratory so I could have easily infected Jin but since Ian was there my AP cost would have bumped up to 3:pa: , and they would get pretty suspicious if I had some missing AP. A few minutes after we had finished relaying Ian head off back to a dorm with Janice since he was low on morale and me and Jin were still in the Laboratory so infected him for the final time and he became Mush. He picked anonymush immediately after I told him too, and since he was an inexperienced Mush, he spored while I was still in the room thinking that other Mush wouldn't affect if it shows up in the logs.</p><p>This ultimately revealed himself within minutes of being converted, no one had entered the lab for a couple of cycles but when they did I was invited to a private chat with most of the crew and was ordered to kill Jin Su or be considered Mush. Jin Su also said that he didn't mind if I called him out or killed him, he just wanted me to do what was best for us. Immediately after I killed Jin Su I quickly picked anonymush since he was the one with the skill so that no one would know there was another Mush, by now the crew were pretty low on oxygen and they had a dangerous O2 planet with a mankarog on it. The next day they finally went on the expedition and since I was the new commander with Jin and Gioele dead, I seized an opportunity to kill off 3 of the most active crew members, Paola, Ian and Andie. <br> <br>They really needed this expedition since they only have 5 oxygen left and if they didn't get O2 on this planet they would die. After moving the ship and effectively killing them, the remaining crew of Chun, Raluca, Janice, Freida Roland basically gave up, Raluca decided to take out all of the remaining O2 capsules to speed up their death which was kinda working against her team. <br> <br>In the end I had attacked Freida a few times, transferred to Janice and attacked her a few more times again, waited a cycle, spored twice and ate both spores and with the last AP I had she finally died, 3 glory well earned.</p><p>In the end, I effectively destroyed this ship.</p>

                <p>Jin Su here! I was suspicious of Stephen, but not for any very concrete reason. He'd been very pleased to announce that he was at max morale after I bombed medbay with four speeches in a row when I wasn't sure he should be that high (we had a SHITTON of murders off the bat, one by a griefing/impetuous Derek, one taking out Derek before he could attack again, one mistaking Eleesha for mush and then taking down Hua). I wasn't sure he wasn't maxed out, though, so I didn't take action. I actually almost jokingly shouted ANYONE WHO COMES INTO FC IS MUSH OMG when I was stranded there for a cycle--apparently I should've, 'cause I got spored there XD<br><br>I fucked up bad sporing with him still in the room, not realizing that two mush would still make it be reported. I did, however, manage to fungal kitchen the ration that Janice ate that ended up allowing Stephen to transfer. In the end I was a pretty ineffective mush, but when they started attacking me I threw a big AHA YOU HAVE FINALLY FOUND ME. MY SISTER HUA HAD TO DIE WHEN SHE WAS DISCOVERED. SHE WENT BRAVELY INTO THE PIT. speech, hoping that Stephen would get Anonymush just as I died (he got in the final blow) so they'd think they were clean.<br><br>As it turned out, it didn't end up mattering, since he was next on the list for commandership and just murdered the whole expedition crew, effectively dooming the ship to oxy loss.<br><br>I wouldn't call it graceful, but it's the first mush victory I've seen in a while and we pulled it off in spite of me fucking up the only conversion they'd managed, so I'd call it pretty fun. Sorry to all the humans whose hopes we dashed! Being, like, five players down from day 2 did nnnot help matters at all.</p>

                <p>Paola here.</p><p>As I said in my final words, a rather disappointing crew for the fact that everyone was fairly active at the start. Three silly murders at the start, then Gioele and Terrence being stupid... Jin Su may have been the most vocal about it but it was pretty depressing to see it go down the toilet.<br>Still, that initial day or so before Derek got punch-happy was fairly hopeful and I'd even started an <a target="_blank" href="http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/journal/v/310">NRJ log</a>. I might have been a bit more useful but ended up having a social life that kept me away from the game for a bit longer than I'd have liked at times.</p><p>I was pretty suspicious of Stephen being so insistent on loading fuel while we were getting ready for the planet, then Andie launched the expedition, getting the three of us killed. Jin Su's speech was rather over-the-top, and I'd said to Eleesha (PMing each other after we killed her off) that I thought the revealed spore log might have been on purpose. Not a lot you can do about it though, so hats off to the Mush.</p>
