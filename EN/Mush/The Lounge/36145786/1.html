We had such great potential. We had <strong>3</strong> Shrinks! (Janice, Two Books)</p><p>But we had absolutely no luck, whatsoever. Our first three expeditions were for Oxygen, as we were running low and the first two resulted in the pump jamming, giving us no Oxygen, while the third only gave us minimal amounts.</p><p>We had to choose between Oxygen and Fuel later, and that left us with three fuel, attempting to scan for planets with fuel and get fuel from capsules... but out of all the planets we scanned, <strong>Not a single one</strong>, ever had fuel.</p><p>As the days wore on, Raluca became incredibly disruptive and hysterical, demanding that we return to Sol a number of days early, refusing to assist in endeavors with planet scanning and working against us, <span class="tid_strike">ultimately leading to returning us to Sol just before the Anti-Mush Serum was done, despite the <strong>entirety</strong> of the rest of the active crew was committed to finishing it before we jumped. We were at 86%, and I think we hit 90% just as she forced us back to Sol. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></span> So it appears that some mysterious third party is our culprit for this, and I'll not be false about this, so I owe an apology to Raluca for accusing her.</p><p>All in all, though, in was an amazing ship. Had we better luck or a few changes on the roster, we would have made it to Eden and I wouldn't doubt we could have Glory farmed our way to the leaderboards. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Raluca here. I didn't force you back to Sol. Check the game logs, it must have been someone else who pushed the button. I enjoyed the ship a lot and wanted to roleplay more but only Janice and Terrence seemed interested in exchanging banter. Frieda seemed intent on making everything into an academic debate, which was interesting the first time but quickly grew tiresome to Kuan-Ti and myself.</p><p>I was constantly worried about the health and morale of the crew as the days wore on and it become more and more apparent we wouldn't reach Sol. But from those concerns all I did was question when we were going back. I disagreed on the timing but I never acted against the crew or refused to assist.</p><p>The fact remains I had no AP to go all the way to the laboratory or the bridge and still be useful. I used everything getting Plasma shield up and working on the Pilgred which was the role of my character. Unfortunately I also had no regular AP gains because often the two shrinks on the ship were not present in both dorms, or all beds were full, and I could not sleep in a dorm with no shrink and another person because of Raluca's Anti-Social handicap.</p>

                <p>I agree we had a perfect start set-up and I was happy to activate gold days for the ship to use <em>Genius</em> so that we could have the Plasma Shield finished on day 2. No one seemed to acknowledge that I did that but I was happy to help the ship regardless. I only wish I could have helped on more than just Pilgred and Neron projects, but without a second sofa or planning of shrink/bed management I often did not have the AP to wander.</p>

                <p>Well, see, I was <span class="tid_wspoil"><strong>Frieda</strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></span></p><p>And sure, I'll apologize for the presumption that it was you who piloted us back to Sol, but at least appreciate my reasoning: No-one (that I could see) was in the bridge before it happened, and your posts regarding going back to Sol and "where is the hacker kit" were the only indication as to what happened, and the rest of us were working in the lab at the time, working to get the serum up in the next cycle.</p><p>That said, I was intent on making a thorough case for anything we did and arguing against anything that was irrational (I.E. Returning to Sol a day and a half early despite the situation being well in hand, Eleesha being mush or a liar despite there being every indication that this was not the case and no basis being put forward for such a suggestion, etc.). I don't consider that to be academic. Just responsible. Sorry if you don't feel the same, but that is where I stand and the reason behind my essays.</p><p>Regarding the working against us, as before, that had nothing to do with the bridge and planet scanning. As I said in game, many, many times, if you didn't want to scan for planets, that was fine; that's just all I needed you for. You didn't appear to, at least by your initial post, be aware that a shrink would allow you to sleep in a bed with no problems, so I suggested that as a means of avoiding that penalty and also mentioned that we had two shrinks. Regarding the planet scanning or any duties on the bridge, that is all I am referencing in that regard.</p><p>But in the way that you were inciting panic by caps-locking equivalents "WE'RE GOING TO DIE GO TO SOL" from a day and half prior to any chance of death being relevant, and support Kuan Ti in his accusations that had no rhyme nor reason, and as it happens, were false, I do sincerely think those actions negatively affected us, especially when prior to that, most of us were on the same page and were progressing fairly effectively. And yeah, when those situations came up, I didn't entertain any of it, and I was blunt, and I was cold, and I didn't care for it and said as much. I did, and I'll own that. But that's because it was irrational. Jin Su and I both had planned counter-measure after counter-measure, were constantly online working on keeping the ship alive, and would be ready to make the jump to Sol when it looked like we had no more time. We told you that, we told everyone. Almost everyone was on-board and seemed to understand what was going on; Why was it so difficult for you? Because you didn't trust us? Fine, but we had the PILGRED done and were working on the cure. Sol was a <strong>given</strong>.</p><p>Sorry if all of this appears like an "Academic Debate", as you say, though note those quotations are not made with sarcasm but with reference, but I believe in being clear and thorough as much as possible. A few sentences wouldn't be enough to properly attempt to convey my feelings or thoughts on the matter, reliably.</p><p>So again, sorry, but you misconstrued my statement when I said that on the Bridge, and I'm sticking by that. I didn't mean that you didn't help at all, but that planet scanning was what I asked you to do, and if you didn't/couldn't do it, then fine. That's all.</p><p>And again, sorry that I falsely accused you of flying the ship back. Given the circumstances, it certainly looked as if you had, given the last few statements on the ship.</p><p>And finally, we had a fantastic ship, just bad luck. I'd be more than willing to say that the bad luck was more the cause of everything going wrong than anything else, so while I disagreed with a number of your statements, I will say that I sincerely do not blame you, and your actions were exemplary beyond that particular incident.</p>

                <p>I'm sorry I jumped the gun and panicked. Near the end I had a hard time keeping track of things because the chat was so laggy with the larger threads. In retrospect I should have been more patient with you guys since you and Jin obvious had a really good plan set out for the ship. I'm also sorry I wasn't more helpful near the end. I hope we can all play together again sometime and get to Eden!</p>
