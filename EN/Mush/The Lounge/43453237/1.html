                <p>This ship:</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6390" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6390</a></p><p>I really doubt anyone from the ship will come read, but I'd like to say some things.</p><p>I was second to wake up on this ship, Terrence being the first. I found the ship eerily quiet, but barely anyone was awake yet. I also noticed it was approximately 3H43M till cycle change, which I had <strong>NEVER</strong> seen before. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico"> So I made a few threads and let the rest of the crew wake up. By the time I had come back, almost half the crew had woken up, but there was only a few words here and there, an occasional 'Hello' from the tutorial starters. I was really growing concerned that this ship was going to be fairly inactive, but I pressed on anyway.</p><p>By the time the 'idle' status's started appearing I knew things were going to be bad. In the end, I think there was 8(?) inactives, and the rest of the crew either barely hopped on or did their job with barely a word or two. Raluca had opened a private channel with Chun and myself concerning the pilot book, which we decided to give to one of our only pilots (Hua or Andie) along the way. I decided to bring up the fact that the ship was very inactive, and we should start rushing PILGRED. She disagreed horribly, and I was forced to watch the O2 levels drop dramatically low.</p><p>By the time the oxygen was around 5, panic mode set in. Well, for me at least, everyone else kept making zombie moaning noises. Hua didn't realize it, but she had become commander, so I managed to coordinate with her to get us to an O2 planet Gioele had scanned right at the start of the ship. Chun had scanned a fairly good looking planet with crystalline but didn't make it obvious that it had oxygen on it. (She phrased it weirdly in a roleplay-kinda way. Was cool but not too understandable).</p><p>Gioeles 2 zone planet was only Forests and Oxygen. That didn't really bother me though, a solo expo with a compass would be a breeze. I changed the crew lock and headed for the planets surface. I even did a bit of roleplay with a "Planetary expedition Thread" but nobody seemed to notice. <em>Luckily</em> I managed to get 24 O2.</p><p>Slowly but surely, a <em>very small</em> amount of progress on Nexus and PILGRED had begun. When I had left research in favor of Projects and PILGRED, all progress pretty much stopped, or at least wasn't recorded. From what I could tell, the entire front half of the ship was inactive, or couldn't be bothered saying a word. Thankfully we had 2 pilots who were able to be on a few times a day to combat hunters.</p><p>Unfortunately 2 pilots isn't really enough to deal with the growing hunter waves. And our hull was taking a beating. I logged on D5(?)C5 before I was planning on going to sleep and noticed our hull going down terribly fast and sprung into action mode. I was holding onto a tech book from comms so I decided to read it and head down to AB2. By the looks of it, Terrence had <span class="tid_strike">(wasted?)</span> used all the scrap that I thought we had on drones. I was feeling slightly defeated but then I remembered we had dismantler! I rushed to the engine room and managed to repair the hull a mighty fine <em>once</em>. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"><br>With my remaining MP I dragged myself to a dorm, then proceeded to yell at Terrence who was praying for the end of the ship and didn't even bother trying to fix the hull. The starving had begun and it was only a matter of time till the MUSH would be revealed.</p><p><em>The End-game</em><br>It was D5(?)C6. 'Bout 11PM my time. I had finished my ranting, tried to make love to Terrence but instead had to use the cat as a substitute. I lay my weary head to bed knowing without any actions from the crew (which I really couldn't rely on) we were going to explode C8. I warned everyone. I tried to get them moving. But, it didn't work.<br>I woke up this morning (at 5AM (sleep is for the weak)), knowing that I'd probably be dead.<br>And I was. But what had happened while I slept was quite the head turner.<br>I had anticipated that the MUSH were inactive since I couldn't really see anything happening, but oh was I wrong.<br>The Paola that I thought was just XP farming because she logged in from time to time but didn't do anything or at least didn't report it? MUSH.<br>The Derek that was constantly in a bed and didn't do anything? Also MUSH.<br>I'm guessing the cat had a spore in it, because shortly afterwards they converted me and used defacer. I'm not sure if the death wave happened before or after, but they went around practically one-hitting everyone. With the massive amount of dead bodies, no amount of hugs could make up for it, and I think C7 the only people alive were 3 MUSH and Raluca?<br>They had a bit of angry words thrown about but in the end the MUSH won.</p><p>But in the end, in my eyes, this wasn't a 'fail' ship... No, it was an 'i tried very hard' ship. What I managed to accomplish almost single-handedly really amazed me. It wasn't without help though. A big thank you to Hua, Andie and Raluca. You weren't exactly the most active people, but you were there when I needed you. I was a little disappointed with Terrence though. He seemed fairly active but he had an 'I don't care' attitude.</p><p>And remember folks...<br><em><strong>A ship is only as inactive as its most active member.</strong></em></p>
