And im so sorry Terrence for blaming u at 1rst . Made huge mistake by missing that log of u getting injured . Nice reaction time Roland .</p><p>So summary of what happened :<br>Found 1rst mush at day 1 cycle 8 . Thought that i had found 2nd mush then and blamed Terrence , but missed log at a dorm .... Had no time to recheck as Roland acted fast and precise <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Then came up with a plan to lure 2nd mush out by touching infected Shelving unit and waiting . Over 1 day passed and mush were not showing up .. We went on expo with volcano and Paola wanted to go as well <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Asked to move out and she did . Expo was a success - volcano missed , O2 and HC received . After expo i did not heal or asked anyone to heal me . Went to engine room and saw it burning with alot of broken equipment . Did not took long to assume that it happened randomly (well most of the stuff prob did happen on its own) and then i saw a log of Paola entering room . Did not had enough proves (ovbious proves as she had Lvl 7 skill to receive no damage while washing) so it was a great opportuniny to blame it all on her . After than Paola came up with a plan : sent me PM (coz i already has spore or 2) .</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Paola a quitt√© la discussion, gender_il left this world. 7min<br>Ian :<br><br>Well it seems like no one cares . And i cant hit anyone coz it just cost too much <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>~12h<br>Ian :<br><br>Sry i just cant as im Human and ur Not .<br>~15h<br>Ian :<br><br>What is ur plan now ? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Just wondering .<br>~15h<br>Ian :<br><br>Sorry but few ppl already knows that ur mush .

We "can" work together lol<br>~15h<br>Ian :<br><br>Then tell me what ? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>~15h<br>Ian :<br><br>I knew since day 2 cycle 1 that something is wrong with u . Did not even need medkit test .<br>~16h<br>Paola :<br><br>Not really :o<br>~16h<br>Ian :<br><br>It wouldve been infected .<br>~16h<br>Ian :<br><br>Thats why i rushed to a dorm and did not took ration from u to move out scraps .<br>~16h<br>Ian :<br><br>Ik ur mush and i already got 2 spores dont i ? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>~16h<br>Paola :<br><br>On the next cycle though<br>~16h<br>Paola :<br><br>Come by medlab for a surprise, I'm sure you'll be happy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br>~16h<br>Ian has joined discussion. ~16h<br>Paola has joined discussion. ~16h </span></span></p><p>Stephen left the room 6min<br>Stephen has picked up the Banana Tree. 6min<br>Stephen has filled their paunch. 7min</p><p>And this is what stephen suddenly says : <br><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Ian :<br><br>Why ?<br>~15h<br> <br>Stephen :<br><br>sory, i can't play yesterday, and leave my character unplayd.<br>~15h<br> <br>Stephen :<br><br>i have put the banana in the medic, i thought you can eat it<br>~15h<br> <br>Stephen :<br><br>what is the cold flu thing in the room log? am I sick? can someone cure me?<br>~15h<br> <br>Finola :<br><br>well he isnt mush if he can get sick<br>~15h<br> <br>Ian :<br><br>Lol . All this just sounds crazy . U guys are making me more and more lost ... Ur response was after 1 min when he wrote even thought u were not communicating much b4 ?<br>~15h<br> <br>Ian :<br><br>And if hes not mush with full ap then why there still is a fire ? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Go put fire out at engine room .<br>~15h<br> <br>Stephen :<br><br>i think u need extincteur to put out fire. do you know where the item is? i put the banana in the medic.<br>~15h</span></span></p><p>So i thought that he may be the 2nd mush (just went active?) . We finished Paola and what ? She is human .. Got lost a min there . Assumed that she body swamped into and in active Stephen . So still had no idea who 2nd mush is . But i did what i had to do as human :<br><strong>Did not heal myself after expo and picked up cat few times to get injured even more and just knew that stephen gonna come after me as i already had 2 spores so i kept on staying under camera and waited. When i became mush i had 0AP/2MP 2HP and an illness black bite <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> </strong> Ofc it would have been better if others would have killed mush b4 i were turned ... Had a fun time fooling mush around actually so that counts as my win <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>The humans are just too actively hunting the mush. By day 4, I am just too tired already, so I thought, gah, let's just convert Ian and deal as much damage as possible; there's no better plan as they have already decided to kill me.</p><p>Curse the RNG, breaking 2 reactors, combustion chamber and setting it on fire after I went there; and <em>all the humans blamed them on me</em>, though I'm sure one or two know that sabotaging these equipments and setting the room on fire requires tons of luck. But the rest humans believed this and start hitting me like mad. Terrence ( which I spored successfully once ), was also killed, which forced me to abandon my original plan: to infect someone, then take anonymush skill and blame Jin Su and the new mush should I am placed in a tight situation.</p><p>After swapping with Stephen, I thought the rest of the team would notice the log and kill me directly; which didn't happen, I don't know why. The log "Stephen was rudely awakened" was there, everyone could see it! But I think no one realizes that this is the log that is shown if you swap with someone idling. To conceal the fact that I'm not Paola further, I changed my writing styles to as if I am a new player, which I think successfully deceived most of the humans.</p>
