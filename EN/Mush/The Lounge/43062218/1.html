                <p>Hello all, I'm Gioele from this ship:<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6249" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6249</a><br>It's my first try in "The Mush Superiority" casting.</p><p>It is the first mush win in this casting as I read so we (red once) should feel a little glorious about our win even with all mistakes that were done on our way <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">, so a little story from our side:<br>The 3 mushes that woke up are Chao(12), Jin (18 ) and me (11).</p><p><strong>Part 1. Inviting Raluca to our side.</strong></p><p>When I woke up Chao and Jin were already in BD, with Jin having 2 spores in hands. Chao managed to wash without splash proof after placing a camera (without making spores <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">). I, Gioele, had all 4 main skills (all unlikely for a mush), so needed to place 2 cameras. So made 2 spores in Nexus, spiked it, and Raluca got a «safe» place to stay at – which she didn't wait to use… tadam… 1 spore in Raluca (opened 3 skills – free spore, splash proof and shelf, Jin took free spore, splash proof and mass mushification :/).<br> Just a bit later (still Day1) 3 researches are finished – gas, serum and alarms, Janice checked to be human with AP food test. Almost all people are in Lab, sometimes in AD or BD, almost no works are held in Nexus.<br>I'm trying to convince Jin or Chao to finish Raluca in Nexus with defacer while humans have no scanner. Jin wants to have 2 spores (guess cause he took mass mushification skill…)</p><p>Day 2 – Jin, Chao, Janice and Ian are going on expo to a cristalite planet, no luck… they’ve got a starmap I mean <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">. Chun suspects Jin.</p><p>Finally Chao agrees to join converting Raluca plan but he wants to take splash proof and free spore not to use AP at all (I wanted him to use defacer cause wanted a possibility for +1 spore a day or smth other for later on). So 3 minutes before CC I take defacer, move to Nexus, deface, infect, move away to Lab work, Chao comes from IB, makes a spore, finishes and moves back to BD.<br> <br><strong>Part 2. Chao died.</strong></p><p>According to what was done and the title you could think we’ve got caught on making Raluca. Actually Chun found out that Chao is leaving notes all around the ship :/ (Chao, why did you do it?), so she started screaming that Chao is infecting all around (which he actually didn’t do at all), asked Chao a HP question, found out that he is not too healthy, and ordered to kill him. Roland kills him, humans get mushovore bacteria so they are sure that Chao was mush. <br>With Chao killed humans are ahead of us on 3 researches and some proven people, we have Raluca instead of Chao.<br>I ask Raluca and Jin (almost full AP) to rush Pilgred and take me home away from those angry people.</p><p><strong>Part 3. Not a lame plan <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.</strong></p><p>I woke up to see Raluca and Jin dead... at least they made Kuan instead <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>Raluca wakes up with 12 AP and 2 pilgred points. She says that Sol is not interesting and that humans are lame so she wants to convert all. A camera in AD is broken (still don’t know if it happened itself or not), she comes, inserts 2 spores in Kuan, fixes the camera. At some moment Chun enters and uses premonition – really surprised how she was so in time. So Chun asks to kill Raluca, Raluca converts and tries to kill Chun, calls Jin, Jin takes off repaired camera in AD, finishes Kuan, uses AP to try to kill Chun, moves to BD, takes off camera there, goes to sleep. Killed by Terrence and Roland, Chao guess killed also by Roland. Question - why did you both try to kill Chun??? And Jin, why didn’t you move to someone? – you had a spore and a skill left for that, you also had AP cause removed camera. Just for information – killing anyone causes mushes to loose glory.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote"><strong> I’ve got “-9” glory points for EVERY person that died on the ship while I was still alive – no matter mush or human, killed or died by himself!</strong></span></p><p><strong>Part 4. Trying to get a glorious death.</strong></p><p>Humans are working on bacteria, spore sucker and soap. We make up a plan with Kuan jumping to Eleesha, Kuan even takes +1 spore skill and glue for that and I make a spore extinguishing a fire (really used almost all AP to find it). Somewhere here I made a mistake asking Chun if she is sure we killed 3 mushes cause what if Jin moved to other. So when I wake up I say that according to my calculation all are mushes (don’t know if it eventually gave me extra time).<br> The next day Stephen confirms himself eating 2 times in Lab, Terrence has gastro, I should say that from the first wash to extinguishing I used AD, but looks like no unconfirmed (mean human <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) BD visitors left. Eleesha looks as if she checked that she is able to print the list and stays quiet about that. Not much O2 left, and Kuan proposes a new plan according to which he goes to live happily on a planet that Frieda found and I am killed by angry people, I agree and we work out the details. I move to the planet, we wait for people to come to IB (eventually only Janice came but that was good enough). Roland and Hua act like catching us <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">, Chun asks everyone except Stephen to use spore sucker <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">, even the ship starts to kill me (-5hp) so we decide to start. The next part is the hardest for Kuan cause takes too many actions that needed to be done with no one breaking the plan. He loads 3 fuel, tries to kill Hua, moves to Roland, tries to kill Hua, takes 3 O2 and starts the expo. After the expo is started I press the button and let him start a family with Janice on a great planet with O2, ruminants, mountains and even IL. Then I try to kill what is left from techs (Hua and Terrence). Hua first cause he said he has 9 HP. <br>Went almost as we planned, Kuan(Roland) even tried to wait some time at IB for one more, but I was afraid someone could unload fuel or Janice would move away. He killed Hua and I was quite unlucky with killing Terrence - 6 successful knife hits and 1 blaster shot didn’t kill him though as he said later he got +2 ap to all actions which eventually helped us. Guess he used his wheel chair as armor <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>... When angry people came to kill me I moved to stay near Ian for some time (at least a little AP waste for them), but they pushed me out of the room and I was killed surrounded by enemy, loosing my blood in the Front Corridor.</p><p>5 of the left died due to lack of O2, 4 from morale loss, they didn’t make it to finish Pilgred</p>

                <p>There are two things I must point out before anything:<br>1, This is my first casting ship and I did not know that I CANNOT select my character.<br>2, I got Eleesha, my all time worst character (don't like her skills, her usefullness and her playstyle).<br>So my opinion might be biased, as I was playing way below my normal gaming and tried to depend on Chun mainly.</p><p>That was my biggest mistake.</p><p>I do not wish to finger point at anything, I do not want to flame, but god darnit Chun. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>I had a few questions about the character (that I stated as OFF topic) since you were the only one I could trust being human and answering it honestly. It did not happen, nor did I got any reliable help from her.</p><p>I had searched 90% of the ship, found a few mycoalarms and pointed at Gioele for possible mush by hiding the Biologist book. I had a few things pointing at him, but got no reaction from her.<br>My problem was that I felt cut off from the ship's groups as I was not invited to any of them, nor did my skills/actions made be confirmed as I rarely found anything of importance (my % skill to see secrets never procced), meaning that I had nobody to trust apart from Chun.</p><p>This, combined with the fact that we had competent mushes, yet strangely incoordinated humans, which again is at the fault of Chun, whose first objective is to build a circle of informants. The casting group said that 2 out of 3 privates were with mushes, and the third was me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br>Even after most of the deaths, the fact that we were going to suffocate was barely mentioned (since at that point we couldn't do anything in that short timeframe) and Pilgred was at a meager 24%.</p><p>For me this was a disappointing cruise, partly because of my dislike of Eleesha, and partly because we just got steamrolled by the mush. (I do think that it could be 3 mushes OR invisibility with all the high leveled mush skills, but that's beside the point.) <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Jin Su checking in! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>First time doing the MS casting. I'm still on the fence if it I would considered it a fun ship. There were some really awesome and not so awesome moments on the ship.</p><p>When I first realized the mush selection, I realized we had this game in the bag. With me leading the ship and the next two people in line to replace me as Captain also being mush... well we could easily control the tempo of the ship. Funny thing was, it really didn't go in a direction I saw at all.</p><p>So far Part I: <br>Chao and I woke up around the same time and quickly started inventorying the ship. We decided to try to act human for the first 24 hours to throw off the mush <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> hunt. However, we had a few chances to throw off the human team right from the get go that we couldn't pass up. Chao found and hid the biologist book and I hid the wrench (Center Bravo Storage).</p><p>I think the human team had a lucky break with the activity cycles of the mush. Chao/Gioele seemed like they could make an effort to meet up on C5 - C7 with some coordination. Poor me often couldn't show up till around C8... sometimes even C1. Somehow I got the feeling from a few humans that I was mush due to my log in times? Not entirely sure how that conculsuion came about.</p><p>I also had Chun breathing down my neck at this stage too. This further complicated my ability to do anything mushy. So my actions at this point mostly had me left doing human things. I hid a few rations when I faked eating, but really that was the extenting of my mush behavior. I also was accused of mush for loading 5x fuel and being dirty.... who doesn't get dirty loading 5x fuel? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Part II:</p><p>I was really confused about Chao's death. I was debating on dropping notes as using trapper as my game plan. I even dropped a note in the FC. Somehow my actions didn't raise any questions and poor Chao got killed for doing the same thing.... but he really did have innocent intentions. The fact that he was hurt was a really crappy reason to kill him. Everyone came back from that expo (where he was hurt) all sorts of jacked up. I even announced we needed medical attention. Janice/Chao came back with 8hp, I came back with 9hp, and Ian I think was the worst around 7hp. I think Janice was the only person that was healed after the expo too while the rest of us where to left on our own.</p><p>Part III: Next post... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Part III: It all goes down!<img src="../../../../gfx/square/fear.png" alt=":fear:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So by some really awesome and horrible luck, the A-Dorm camera breaks which throws most of the ship into a royal rumble. When it broke, I asked Racula to rush to go fix it and I would give her a mission to do so. While there she could spike someone as well. I've been itching to give my missions to my mush partners and this was a great reason to do so. So I go AFK while waiting to Racula to read my message. I come back five minutes later to see all these messages spamming my screen on how I am mush. Not really sure how that bridge was crossed. So now I get really fishy on the rules due to mush not being able to rampage and kill the crew. I honestly was not really outted, but with Chun leading a crusade and pushing for mush tests, I felt I had really no other choice. So Racula and I start trying to kill Chun. She was saved by Janice waking up and employing 'ceasefire' which put a stop to our rampage. I run around, remove the cameras from both A Dorm and B Dorm hoping to create more suspects on who could be mush. I then spike Kuan Ti and bring him over to our side.</p><p>So I really never seen 'ceasefire' in play before and made the fatal assumption it turns off at cycle change. Which I learned the hard way, that it doesn't. So I set my watch for a few minutes before cycle change and go about my business for the next hour or so. I check in to find out I was killed by Roland 'Slayer of Mush' Racculi had taken me down. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"> I really don't know why I didn't launch in a fighter while waiting out the cycle change. Anyways... a little bit of stupidity of my part.</p>

                <p>Hua here. Good show by the mush though I was 90% sure that Jin Su was mush from early. On a 3-mush ship going for ANYTHING but an O2 planet from the start is the height of foolishness and only a mush or an idiot would support that. Every ship so far, including two ships ago, that had a mush do that turned out to be a mush Jin. I told Chun, but that was the end of it as far as I can see. Definitely too mush attention paid to (intentional) human proofing and too little to basic profiling.</p><p>I logged on just in time to see Kuan Ti bash the snot out of me then spike Roland. I should have run there but took the time to post an alert then to copy the logs. Before I could post them and leave, I was killed. Oh well, die and learn.</p>

                <p>I'll stand by my choice to conduct an expo to a non-O2 planet as our first expo. <br>1. This is a casting and not a random ship. We could count on an active Frieda and a back up character to assist with planet scanning.<br>2. Our Expo was completed in 24 hours from planet ID to expo return.<br>3. We were sitting at 28ish O2 when we flew to the planet.</p><p>I felt that we could knock out this expo and be able to return to orbit with enough time to find an O2 planet with ease. On a random ship, I agree that this action would be foolish. However, on a casting ship we know that all players are active and engaged. We don't have to wait 48 hours to see who dropped from the game by going inactive. We also started D1C1 where most random ships dont fill up till the end of D1 or maybe the start of D2.</p><p>So in the end, I don't think it was all that foolish of a move on a casting ship.</p><p>Really wierd thing was that I helped with research and even gave missions to help in research. I really made it an effort to play human for the first 72 hours to throw off hint of being mush, then I figured after D3 I would be able to get a little more slack should I do anything stupid or considered mushy.</p><p>The one thing I really struggled with on this ship is when, as a mush, I'm allowed to start fighting the crew. Going on a mush assault/rampage is never my first, second, or third course of action on any ship. But with the spot light being on me and narrowly talking my way out of situations, I knew my cover was close to being blown. Though, I couldn't afford to wait, since Chun was hyper paranoid and wanting my head. I feel that if the human team can kill people under reasonable assurance that a person is mush, that mush can commit a first strike if they have reasonable assurance that they are being targeted.</p><p>As for three mush, I feel its a good mix against 13 active silver/gold humans. I could go either way on the anonymush. Which for the record doesn't do much since you get extra glory for killing mush in the room logs. So its not as if you don't know if you killed a human or mush.</p>

                <p>Hmm, about AP food test, Janice, sorry for suspecting you if you didn't notice it (it was not a 2 times eating test). On day1 there was a moment when you researched alarms (enough of your AP relays already done) and then you said you should go cause in other case you wouldn't be able to get to dorm (it really looked though according to AP you already used). Kind Chun took you a ration and Finola said that you should finish the research cause she has other stuff to do. You ate it and finished the research. One of the "problems" also - you didn't visit BD dorm before that moment.</p><p>Why I think it was Chuns AP test - really looked like she tried to do the same with me later on <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.</p>

                <p>Hello! Beta mush Kuan Ti reporting <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>1) First of all, I was quite restricted in terms of play due to RL - only very late C7-C8, hardly C1 (3am for me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">), and episodically C3. So I was quite surprised high level mush chose me as a target <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> On the other hand, crewmates were used to see me absent all the time</p><p>2) No idea how much time I won when telling everyone I have 2 spores on me (already been converted by that time). I was expecting to be killed for over a day. Especially since I didn't take care of plants</p><p>3) Roland transfer Janice kidnap run was planned differently, I was hoping to get more people with me to the planet, hoping for pilot to be idling in IB. Also, I've made HUGE mistake not taking weapons; Gioele told me Roland will be holding weapons, but he didn't, and I even didn't look at the AD shelf, being in awful hurry <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> If I did, Terrence would have been dead for sure (4 free shots); also, Gioele probably failed to send me mission (or it was a bug? hard to say)</p><p>4) as for 3 starting mush, it's actually harder to take decisions <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I've been through it on my first casting (alpha mush, miserable death, ship still on the way to eden), with 3 mush noone wanted to step up, expecting someone else to take initiative, me included. Also, human team is way more alert with 3 mush starter. And it's easier to kill random mush and get mushivore. So it's quite different from 2 starters, but doesn't change game dramatically for one side.</p><p>5) My humble proposal for possible rebalance - prohibit *eating* anything during first 8 cycles, unless Mush started rampage due to unintentional loss of cover.</p><p>PS I was enjoying the ship, but mostly after making up Icarus hijack &amp; Janice kidnap plan. Thanks everyone! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>PPS Gioele, you played really great; Hua, my apologies for killing you, nothing personal, I really liked you, but a game is a game; Janice, do you like our new house down on the planet? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Yes, I guess I did something wrong with that mission or it went to new Kuan.

I was quite sure you have high chances with Terrence left alive. If being a human I would have concentrated only on Pilgred works:<br>1) use all needed AP to heal Terrence (maybe with Finola with a Kit) and save all his AP - it was even more important than to kill me, also give all bananas to Terrence and both missions<br>2) leave 1 more human to collect AP to relay PIlgred <br>3) for Paola - find Xyloph books (they were still unopened if I've got it right)<br>4) there was a chance that Roland has 4 level Kuan<br>5) and to the end - I probably would give Terrence one of the O2 capsules so he could live longer if no other chances for a tech left</p><p>What was your plan of survival after our death?</p>

                <p>Kuan, I think you picked up a spore on a trap from earlier. Plan was to spike you an additional time when the camera broke. But when Chun busted Racula, we had to strike. So I ran through and dumped another spore on you. So you really just became a target of opportunity which worked out for the best since you managed to take out Janice. A simple request, name your first child after me? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Actually as I remember Raluca spiked him 2 times in a row (if I understood her right) - she was asking who to choose Kuan or Janice and choosed Kuan. We didn't spike more shelfs than the first time in Nexus (at least I didn't hear about that). It's not easy at all to use shelfs with alarms all around the ship...</p>

You have been taged with bad luck something bad will happen to you [...]"</em> okay - someone makes jokes...about faith i shreeded the bad charm and left corridor - at that moment gosh i was so dul i didnt catched that at first Chao knocked another post its few day later bluntly in RC two of them and all were blank peace of papers - and it stroke me - Holllyyy shhoot... l... it wasn't to send a message -<em> We have a trapper on the ship</em>.

Yu just have to keep your eyes open and mind cooled. At some point when i started to talk about the xxx topic of last expo Chao - shooted out from the blue about his Health. noone asked him, noone i mean noone sayed anything and we heard: <em>"I'm currently 11"</em> and that would not turn my eyes on you if you would not add few magic words : <em> " Perhaps from moving <strong>some</strong> objects in the past"</em>. I have checked you with the medkit day before that and i knew ...something is fishy out here - Chao goes to the expedition and knocks it post its in RC instead moving it in Icarus and knocking it there ? ...Gotya one mush locked on on 85% now the others <br>I turned my eyes on investigation matter - since those two lovebirds <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/stephen_seagull.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_SS:" class="tid_ico"> + <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/eleesha_williams.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_EW:" class="tid_ico"> decided to stay in labolatory for first 1-2 days zZz...<br>lads your help was really great after day 2 ..but it was too late - i understand we all have private life and sometime shit tends to happen so no bad feeling here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> ...yet at some point it was nail to the coffin with my relationships with Eleesha and Stephen - Stephen got it out with no time and he did a food test and Eleey was most helpfull - but it was allready too late for us to salvage the situation - mush were wth numbers of 4if not with 5 ... and we all know what it means when matriarch mush in numbers of 3+ are on the ship... <br>I fallowed <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/wang_chao.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_WC:" class="tid_ico"> after the expo and used premonition on him "last action washed " asked for help to confirm that shower - 17H Ago Chao picked up soap... 17 h /3 = ~5-6 cycles. questions withought an answear - and a hard decision to make <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/wang_chao.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_WC:" class="tid_ico"> was executed mostly due to post its ; exact number of HP he mentioned 11 - <strong><em>before</em> the expo</strong> - Chao had to die.

Jin Su is like a father of all fathers - a grandfather - he needs to look on a matter and have no hesitation of things that has to be done - seeing any thread seeing litterally a future what will happen IF... A coommander with good planing ahead skills must <br>1) protect the Crew by all cost<br>2) Protect the ship by all means necessary <br>3) get People safe to home and kicking some asses of mush.</p><p>Commander - you stroke me as an experienced person and your careless was like a red sheet of plywood on a bull...
