                <p>Hey all, it's only 'essentially' over, despite having 23 hunters of various types shooting at us, they sure miss a lot. We made it (sort of) to D9 C2! Except C2 hasn't happened yet. It will though, because we made it to D9 C1 and I'm not dead yet! But I might as well be, heh.</p><p>Racula here. Chun and I got to be the final survivors, which was nice; I woke expecting the whole ship to be dead, instead all the mush and other humans were but she and I were still alive. I found myself to be captain; while I gave her a mission she, who found herself to be Comm Officer made the most awesome and poetic general annoucement I can imagine. I saved it, but I'll let her decide if she wants anyone but me to see it - I think it's more than worthy of being shared widely - heck, I say it belongs on the lyrics page.</p><p>Then Chun brought me the cat, and went and reset Pilgred; she then lied down and breathed her last, by chance saving that last breath of air for me.</p><p>Alone but for my cat on a ship full of corpses, no O2, surrounded by 23 hunters, at least 2 of which were astroids scheduled to impact this turn, 5 separate fires, the hull's at 8%; there was clearly one thing to do, since I'm Racula. I made it to Pilgred and advanced it again. It's at 81% guys! We're almost there!</p><p>I'm waiting for another reset, guys. I know it's not going to happen, but why wait for the end? The end's just another reset, right? I hope you're all already happy on your next ships, you were great to play beside and you deserve awesome next ships!</p><br><p>This one was really rough for a lot of reasons; I think most of us were newbies (my 4th voyage). A griefer killed our Hua, who was clearly a decently experienced player. There's a LOT more that happened, it was a neat trip actually, but I'm at work and don't have time to say much. Maybe others can step in and tell their stories from this ship? There's tons I don't know and I'd like to.</p><p>It's technically not over yet - but I'm the last alive and am at 0 AP and there's no air. There's no secrets left you need to keep from me - I'm dead next cycle from air + hull implosion, so I declare this party started! Come celebrate, you awesome shipmates who struggled so hard to learn with me!</p>

                <p>I was the Alpha mush, the one that survived the longest. You guys got the ability [constispore?] that slowed spore production fairly early, and it hurt. Otherwise, I was doing pretty well. Also, a couple of people that got spiked were subsequently killed before I could turn them, from unrelated things. Including, of all people, Hua!</p><p>Rather than go active against the humans, I was mildly supporting them, doing a lot of running around the ship, helping, while at the same time spiking when I could. I didn't sabotage anything, the whole ship - I didn't need to!</p><p>Still, it was interesting, and I learned a fair bit.</p>

                <p>That makes you Frieda; still a great idea to name your character because only a few players lived long enough to know you by what you said about yourself.</p><p>Constipaspore would have made it cost 4 AP to make a spore; what we finished was instead antispore gas, which knocked you down to 2 spores a day.</p><p>I liked how you played, I think it let us all learn a lot. Your threat/honest intention to gag me at what I believed was the final cycle of our play (because hull % + shields down + so many hunters) utterly horrified me; I would have preferred death to silent survival - and I lacked the AP at that time to ungag myself.</p><p>It's a fair move, but a great 'griefing' move, not in the reportable sense, but awesome to do to make me and only me suffer, without actually having much chance to change any outcome of the game - mush still won, humans still lost.</p><p>However, if you intended what you did as a -threat- only ... wow. You are a master of using effective and scary threats, and I was -very- scared about one of the few 'things I had control over' left - the very words I could speak, that I could speak them. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/eek.png" alt=":tid_eek:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Thank you, for letting me continue to speak. Even if you only did it cause you didn't realize the AP resources required to follow through.</p>

                <p>Here's our final report, all finalized: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1373" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1373</a></p><p>I'm still at work, so no story yet, but a few things I want to say immediately:</p><p>Chun, you gave me that golden Supernova place, and you did it as a tie. And it was only possible for me to tie you because you made it possible - with your final gift of reseting my Pilgred process. The game picked you for Silver, but to me, we share this gold. You did a LOT on this ship. You killed a sabotaging mush alone; you repaired a sabotaged O2 tank alone, you provided lots of activity and support throughout the ship. We all have a lot to learn, but you deserve to share gold this ship, methinks.</p><p>And please post that wonderful lyric parody it made! It was so nice not even dying hurt, because I was singing it at the time!</p><p>Hua, you may find your way here sooner or later. Your last words, "Iam is 100% mush"... sort of true. Worse, he was human. But he died 2 cycles after you (and you died on cycle change, so that was swift, as swift as we could do). May all griefers become reformed or banned.</p><p>Roland, your last words, "Good job humans, altho Kuan Ti's reasoning was poor, as I had never lied to the crew. Hope to play again with Raluca when I'm less emm fungal" ... Me too, Roland. As to Kuan Ti, I used my last moments aboard ship to report him for two highly questionable behaviors. Random killing, for a human, is not alright, even if you happen to get lucky and murder a Mush. Now, I don't know what his evidence is, even though I asked - because he never answered and less than 8 cycles after he murdered you he was dead from starvation. That bothers me -greatly-, because that suggests that in addition to possibly random-killing you, he may also have chosen to suicide, another great breach of the rules.</p><p>If he was an experienced enough player to identify something highly suspicious about Roland's behavior, then he should have had more than enough experience to seek healing if he was wounded, to know how many cycles (approximately) were left to pass before starving could start, and he 100% knew that he could have talked privately to Chun and safely gotten healing in one way or another even on the edge of death. That he did <strong>none</strong> of these things speaks to me of him being an offender, though of a slightly more subtle sort than our Awful Ian.</p><p>In any case - I urge everyone to report probable misconduct. You cannot get the innocent in trouble - and if Kuan Ti did have detectable evidence, the experienced people who will review Kuan Ti's every action on that ship will see how he picked Roland to kill - be that random or not. They'll also have the full story of the circumstances of Kuan Ti's death, and if it actually was a choice to take no action to prolong his life (that's suicide if it's not ignorance) or if he had several cycles of plates falling on him followed by a single cycle of starvation, all while he was offline or what else actually happened.</p><p>Well, back to work I go. Storytime later! Some neat stories on every ship, I hope I'm not the only one to share some about our aventures here.</p><p>Brief afterward, after I glance at the end page one more time....<br>Jin Su... ended up with 'brute force mutant' title? OMG, Chun! That was a fight between you then, not just you slaughtering him at my word having caught the sabotage? Because I know Jin Su didn't attack me....</p><p>See? People have -stories-. I wanna know them! Whaaaaaaa, tell me or I temper tantrum! <strong>winks through playful pretend tears</strong></p>

                <p>Sorry, yes, I was Frieda. And, truly, the gagging might have happened, but I ran out of AP - I didn't think to have an extra. Should have dropped the trakker and used the scooter. Storywise - not much else I can say. I tried to play as if I wasn't mush, and use Phagocyte to give me extra moves and actions, to pull extra things off. Did anyone suspect me, until the very end? I'm curious.</p>

                <p>Yes, you were suspected, primarily because when Janice was converted, there was a window of time before she took anonymush, and it was noticed that we had an extra mush. Three of you were all in the same camera-less dorm at that time; Janice, you, and the person Janice later attacked, was it Eleesha? I forget who else now. Shortly after Janice took Anon and rampaged. But not really effectively, and some assumptions were made that the conversion happened in that room. Janice had been human-helpful before that new mush popped up, her Mush behavior didn't match her previous play making her the logical pick for new convert.</p><p>Her target could have been the other mush, but that's pretty much playing against the team.</p><p>So yeah, we considered you. But by that point we very much did have many problems and we were drowning.</p>

                <p>Yeah, she apparently didn't like being mushified. She immediately berserked, chose the worst possible skill [which I recommended against in mush channel], and never said a single thing on the mush channel. Sad, but fair play. And probably semi-realistic; some are going to continue to infiltrate, while the bodies of others are going to have a violent reaction to the infection.</p>

                <p>So I was Jin. Helped as I could, that ship was a losing effort. Guess ti was day 6 that Freida turned me(before she turned Janice). Happened around 20 minutes before I came online. So I took anonmush because I was fairly sure no one caught it. I helped a little while waiting for what could be done. I thought I could sabotage both oxygen tanks but got really unlucky on the second one and was at 91% chance when I ran out of AP. Then you guys knew I was Mush.</p><p>By the way Racula, you were spiked twice, just guessing Freida could not get the third one on you.</p><p>As for our biggest mistake, I think it was not having a camera in both dorms. Way to easy to spike people. the inactives and Paola not knowing how to really play the comm officer really hurt.</p>
