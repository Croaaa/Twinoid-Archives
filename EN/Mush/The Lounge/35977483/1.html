                <p>Hi guys, Kim Jin Su Asteroid here! I'm writing this ahead as it's gonna be hopefully a long ship. A long and a great one! Everyone aboard is real awesome. I'm writing this on Day 10 after i got two metal sheets into me the last 4 cycles.<br>We've been real lucky in the early days!</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2504" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2504</a></p><p><cite>Stephen : I go to sleep and we have a Plasma Shield? Guys, please remember the Day 3 - Cycle 8 of our journey, for this was the day that we had two map fragments at once, killed a mush and got a Plasma Shield. Should've woken up earlier.</cite></p><p>It was real crazy. Those early Mush hunt days. We knew it was Roland since day one or two. As we had a Mycoscan and we found out that Chao was at 2 spores, i immideatly called a Quarantine threatening to Kill anyone who breaks it. Roland went in there ofcourse. As well breaking into engine room which Raluca didn't want. I was the only pilot with him as Hua was an inactive. I decided to make him use 4 AP to take us into the expedition which gave us two starmaps and killed him right after it.<br>Perhaps a day later, we had no lead on the last remaining Alpha mush.. knowing that Chao is on 2 spores, it got real intense as pointing out the Mush could result in Chao becoming a Mush. Eleesha printed the list anyway, we had around 5-6 names? Which we cut into only 3 possible names. Therefore we decided we would give them a chance for a Mush test to Terrence, Kuan Ti and Giolee. (Eat pill and ration one) Only Kuan seemed to agree while Terrence seemingly going mute again. We killed him with Chao. Unfortunately, the plan to save a human was a fail as we just killed one. Chao taking too many risks to go after our real Mush, stayed in Alpha dorm which we killed Terrence in. (Luckily Giolee didn't know that) I rushed into Bravo dorm but Giolee was already gone! Luckily he didn't drop his tracker so as i'm used to keep note of the tracker as Eleesha it was immideatly obvious he was in the rear storage where he suddenly started Guarding the room.. Interesting.. that was his last infamous action while i shot his brains out.<br>There it was! We were Mush free! Altough down to 10 active crew untill today. (I'm not counting the inactives, counting Chun though which started to be active on Day 7-9)</p><p>Perhaps i'm gonna write how much i love each crewmember of this ship.. perhaps not.. But i can't deny that our two geniuses: Finola, my cat-eating accomplice.. brain augmentated from schrodinger.. and Raluca our most attractive female of the ship. Paola.. who got us amazing Neron upgrades. (Most famous plasma shields!)<br>You're all special! (Not in that way) And you got attached to my heart. I'm really enjoying this ship the most so far. Stay great guys.</p><p>Day 10.</p><p>We are fully stocked up on fuel and oxygen but even though we were so lucky on Day 3 we haven't found the last remaining starmap piece.<br>Another expedition and yet no starmap piece. We just keep trying and hopefully we will pick it up on scans this very day! Altough we just got a second invertable shell.</p><p>Day 11.</p><p>We have found another cristalite and are about to launch an expedition, we expect no trouble.</p><p>Day 14 <br>By this point we decided to give up on Eden even though we had two starmaps together with plasma shields and i took us to Sol as 3 of us dropped below 5 health in just one cycle.</p><p>Final words:<br>Everybody deserved to get back to Sol.. after Paola's death i didn't want to push the pursue after Eden if i could.. the majority agreed to return so here we are.. in yummy's cats mansion and we finally get to check out Raluca's website.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> haha.. i don't remember what all i wrote here and i meant probably just to record information and then get it all together somehow but my HDD is bad and i have to prepare my computer for the worst as i were unable to boot up for 3 hours. I wish you all the best and hope to play with you someday again! CASTINGS! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now this ship haven't been only straightforward! Stephen started writing a book!</p><p>Stephen's book:</p><p>*Prologue: It was sadly destroyed from a roof collapse..<br>*Chapter 1: Half-opened gray eyes spied on a man with a cream-colored cape as he entered the Nexus room. Raluca's hands grasped on the automatic steel door's edge as she hid from plain sight trying to spy on Kuan Ti. Kuan Ti, however, noticed her as he finished typing something on Neron's Core. "Raluca, I need some relay on the projects? Can you do it?" Her pale skin began blushing as the words reached her hearing. "Y-Yes Kuan Ti-senpai!" As he exited the scene, Raluca started drooling as she continued her senpai's work on the projects, thinking of things related to her hobbies which included, but not limited to, yaoi. "You can relay me anytime, senpai," she muttered like the fangirl that she is. Schrodinger's telepathic words, however, distracted her. "Raluca, commence transformation and head to the Bridge right away! There's something blocking the terminal... your great nemesis Hua!"*</p><p>*Chapter 2*: Raluca magically teleported from the rear part of the Daedalus to the Bridge. She took a look around to scan the surroundings for any hostile movement. Paola was there, sleeping on her sofa in front of the Comms Terminal. Frieda's rotting body was also there, though people claimed she was still alive. And then the magical girl saw it! Hua, the fat lady with a backpack and eyes smaller than Jin Su's, was lying down on the Astroterminal. "That's Kuan Ti-senpai's workspace! How dare you dirty it, you insolent fool!" She took her wand and used it to pierce through Hua, but her body fat only absorbed the weapon like a black hole. Soon, the force exerted by the fat was slowly becoming greater than Raluca's that her hand was inches away from being eaten. She tried to look for help, but Paola was still sleepy from phoning his boyfriend and Frieda was busy decomposing at a corner. Her hand is seconds away from being devoured by Hua's fat, bringing Raluca to think of ways to stop the madness.*</p>

                <p><cite>Proulouge: Raluca sat in front of a turned-off computer monitor, using it as a mirror as she fixed her bright pink hair into pigtails. Beside her is her trusted companion, Scrhodinger, a being full of unknown powers. As our heroine continued beautifying herself in the Engine Room, the cat tugged his owner's sleeve before opening its mouth. "Raluca, looks like we have trouble on the Rear Bravo Storage!" The girl spun around and executed her transformation scene! From that dirty rag of a costume, her clothers changed into a pink dress with long white stockings, pink bows holding her hair and a magical wand on her hand. Although most people know her as a simple girl, it turned out that Raluca wasn't as simple as that. She's a magical girl with powers that will wipe out evil!</cite></p><p>Stephen here! Too bad I lost interest on my Raluca fan fiction which I could have ended with Raluca marrying her master Schrodinger-kun instead of Kuan Ti-senpai. I could have saved Terrence's life by pointing out Gioele's missing AP repeatedly on the mush hunt discussion. Too bad the lag didn't help me :&lt;. I'm also really sad that Paola didn't make it with us, considering she made a lot of miracles with the Plasma Shield, General Patching Up and that Sofa+Lizaro BP from Xyloph. Guys, you keep forgetting about our second sofa. xD</p><p>I guess we were lucky I just got experience for that Level 5 skill. I don't know how we managed to keep up until Day 14 with just two pilots, especially since one of us is the commander. Also, Finola taking Diplomat and Kuan Ti taking Technician in the middle of the ship saved us a lot of times. Eleesha also became our Ian until the end of the game by reading the Biologist Mage Book and taking care of the bananas. Too bad we got the Jumpkin too late. <span class="tid_strike">At least I'm at the top 62 in the rankings :&gt;</span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Stephen Seagull</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Guys, guys, guys!

Imagine that Terrence or Roland alive could have bought us two more days.. or also not.. who knows? We were barely holding with our job shedule on the ship and everyone was too busy with no :ap: to spare! People were kind of against when i called the expedition on the HC+ fuel safe planet as everyone wanted cristalite.. but we were completely full on oxygen after and we never had fuel problems. It's the mind games. Someone dies, you are on low oxygen.. you decide to give up. If we took it easier and took days off from expeditions (I was unable to do anythnig about hunters for half of the day after these) Well.. perhaps we would make it to our dreamed Day 20 with all Jumpkins growing nicely from day 16. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Our crew did still great growing them though!

Although he was inactive, he didn't take a bed. It's probably from the paranoia/excitement, I think. We can at least make it through Day 15 if it wasn't a weekend and everyone doesn't have anything to do irl. I wish Finola, Eleesha, Paola, Chao, Chun and Janice post here. I think we can still continue a bit of our RP in our AP. :&gt;</p>

                <p>Hello crew, your bad hot girl Finola here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I enjoyed my role SO MUCH - first I was provoking Gioele with his coffee as he was not Caffeine Junkie and obviously was not helping, maybe a moron disappointed he is Mushy creature <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Then Raluca joined and knocked us all down with her Genius being together with beloved Schrodinger. It was one of the most brilliant role play I ever seen. I had very good times laughing so much and as Finola character cannot caress Schrodinger, I joined her play as cats hatred. Then Jin joined us as a fat cat eating Asian and it was perfect <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>But let's not forget Chao, my secret love and our fearsome wrestler and shooter in one person! Eleesha, my true partner with both research and botany. Stephen, always full of jokes and in good mood, sneaking behind Roland's back to watch how the patrol ships are piloting. Kuan Ti, our handsome optimistic designer, working hard both on the planet scans and Neron projects. Paola, our sleeping beauty and true treasure, unlocking all Xyloph mysteries and rebel bases pretty quick. Janice sunshine, always helpful and smiley action lady, shooting asteroids when it is needed to! And silent Terrence, always loving his little robotic friends...</p><p><em>"Day 3, I woke up after hard day full of research relays. Fire alarm was screaming with that evil high ear tearing sound which we will remember for long... Janice with Stephen were already looking for it. I checked my beloved microscope, but there was only Schrodinger snoring at frozen Chun's shoulder. Then Roland found it in the Garden - phew! Trees were little thirty, but already resting save at my Laboratory window. That sprinter guy was suddenly at right place at the right time, after I was thinking he is inactive for more than day... So I could take a nap for little longer, no - wait I heard someone get hurt, I'll get the medikit and... hey wait, where's my medikit? It was right here stored in the shelf side by side that colorful pills I was protecting and now it's gone! It was only Chao, me and... Roland? Hey I did report MedLab is save hmmmmm. So I told Eleesha, I trust her not being a Mush, let's see if she is thinking the same about me. Our sympathy Chun seems gone for long, so I will risk... Oh what it is going on on the Bridge? Cristalite planet with oxygen, mysterious caverns, intelligent life and many more tempting things? Awesome, seems like I can tell them my little secret and give this crew a sign of thrust. They got no idea, even that genius antisocial with ugly stinking cat, that I am trained Diplomat with true hidden power. No living creature will risk a meeting with my scalpel, hahahaha! Even a Mush... wait, speaking about Mush... they don't believe me, they are so worried to loose a fellow Pilot and want to take him for the expedition weeeell, wait here my little diary, I must go too. No way those stinky ugly creatures will breed on this ship..."</em></p><p>And then it went fast. We DID find two starmap pieces and we finally killed Roland to find out he was really Mush! Now it was Eleesha's turn, I did not like Gioele, but he as ship owner was in right to mad on me. So I was glad, it's only one remaining and was watching how the Mush hunt will continue. Shame, we have interpreted Terrence's actions like play against our goal and did choose him as a first to kill as he was on the list. Gioele was pretty damn silent and I bet he was watching all that time as he moved right after the poor robotic soul death. But hey, we were Mush-free! The same time Paola did a Neron update and we got Plasma shield! Cannot imagine better start of exciting journey to find Eden...</p><p>Hard to recall all things that happened, this play was full of fun, enjoyable chat, I learned again a lot of details I can use great on my next ships. I think we all must admit that biggest surprive was, when Chun woke up at Day 7. It was like magic! Another valuable crew member helping the team to find us our biggest dream. But that was not our fate. The expeditions were slow and we did only 10 (ten!!!!) during whole game. Other experienced players must be knocking their heads on the table reading this. You cannot find Eden the way like this - I got friend playing right now and his ship is same time as ours (so day 15 today) and they are doing at least 3 expeditions per day and still got only two fragments. You know, maybe we could be little more strict and consistent and organized. But, on the other hand, strict discipline can kill the game as well. It was really fun to play just like we did. Enjoying the game, enjoy every single day and face what it brings. Sometime we were very lucky and could end much much sooner, but I am not regretting it. My best experience in Mush so far, my friends. THANK YOU!</p>

                <p>I regret calling suspicion on Terrence before Gioele, as it seems it made everyone more wary of him. To be honest, I wasn't really that suspicious of him because I simply couldn't find any reason that he would be a danger to us if he never went to the dorm with a shower and never got dirty. If Terrence was around, we might have made it a lot farther.</p><p>To be honest I was surprised I managed to keep up with repairs as long as I could. In the last few days I was barely even repairing anything myself, I could only keep up with it by converting all my AP to MP and moving the Terrys around to save myself failed attempts, while only fixing easy things like oxygen tanks myself. Add loading the fuel, and my bed being all the way on the other side of the ship in the Medlab, and my work was extremely inefficient, running between the front and back of the ship multiple times a day.</p><p>Add to that the fact that we have 1.5 pilots (The commander's a part-timer <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">) and consequently very little Scrap Metal, add the massive hunters and insane electric shortages/fires and our ship just gave out. Next time I won't patch the whole thing together with bubble gum. And maybe put a few of Schrodinger's eyes in the turrets. Actually while I'm at it, I should turn the head of the ship into Schrodinger's face, and place the turrets at the eyes. Senpa- ahem, Kuan Ti, we need to start drawing plans immediately! (Takes out a crayon and starts doodling a sketch of a spaceship with a giant cat head shooting lasers out of its eyes)</p><p>Thankfully, the other areas of our crew were filled nicely. Finola worked miracles with her Shamanistic Biology powers and headed all of our research and expeditions with very few hitches. Eleesha turned into a pothead, I mean, took care of our pots in Ian's place, and Kuan Ti worked hard, three-timing as a planet scanner, technician and project researcher. Janice, Chun and Chao covered our backs, manning the turrets when needed and helping out with all research and ship maintenance, and providing tea and biscuits on top of it all. And of course, our dedicated pilots Stephen and Jin Su kept us safe and going.</p><p>All things considered, we only had 1.5 pilots, 1.5 technicians, 1.5 planet scanners, and a cat with 1.5 eyes, and we still hauled it out all the way to Day 14 and it was awesome. Pushing to our limits even without sufficient crew was part of what made this game so memorable for me, but more than anything, it was just fun having you all around.</p>

The mush test in this case was only meant for either of you which would have saved a human in the case. I'm not a fan of mush test but if you look at it that way that there is 100% a mush of Two people how does it hurt to save one human for the long run ahead? What we wanted to evade happened and we killed the Mush right after you died.. we named drones in your honor, little Terry's. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hello Terrence! I am glad you wrote a few... You know, you were printed on Eleesha's list, that's why we even were considering you are Mush, you did nothing wrong, really. It was you or Gioele. Our "bad" luck was we did choose you as first as Gioele refused to do the test and you went silent. Later Raluca constructed nice roboarmy and we called them Terry #1 #2 and #3 to keep you in memory, they helped us a LOT and we were able to keep a speed with all those breakages. I hope to see you again in the game as well, take care!</p>

                <p>Hey Terrence <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> good to see you. Yes, I felt particularly guilty because you were very helpful to me, so I named your drones after you, and even constructed the third one, and they saved us from disaster for pretty much ever day after D10.</p><p>I understood you logged on infrequently from our private conversations so I only meant to point out that you rarely posted progress on anything, but I thought about it and realized you couldn't be mush. You never really got dirty and I knew from your logs that you pretty much stayed in Alpha Dorm and didn't move around much, just like you told me in our conversation.</p><p>Unfortunately the pill test was conducted while I was offline and thus I couldn't vouch to kill Gioele first for you. Which is a real shame because after we were mush free, the ship really got interesting. Hopefully we'll play again together sometime, I'll be more careful!</p><p>And yeah, Finola...I guess you have a point.

The decision made in the mush hunt channel was only to kill either Gioele or Terrence. I kinda wished Raluca was indeed online when the kill happened since the only things I know is that Gioele only spent 8AP for relays on the ship while taking a bed till Day 4. Eleesha's AP was also used on relays and garden stuff so no hardcore detective worked happened (I think, I'm kinda offline on your active hours lol). I wished you talked a lot more in the main channel, though. <span class="tid_strike">Talkative people get killed less often in my previous ships</span>. Hope to see you in my next ships. :&gt;</p>

                <p>I do realize it was bit of gamble on your guys end. Gioele was just enough a shady mush to mix me into the mush hunt with the printed list.</p><p>I think the biggest deciding factor was my unforrtunate timing too. I got hungry and ate a ration around 4 minutes BEFORE Janice (I think it was Janice) proposed the test. Actuallly could've gone through if I could've chosen one of those MP pills (Microwave needed dismantling). But yeah, a crewmember saying he just ate minutes before a pill test? I would've shot too!</p>

                <p>That really is unfortunate, and that's a side of the story that none of us ever knew. Still, telling us that you ate a ration first might have spared you the benefit of the doubt - there's always a chance that the crew members are willing to make an agreement with you and keep you under watch until you're able to do it, which is probably a higher chance than going silent immediately after being accused. I guess my point is that it didn't really help that you didn't really seem to attempt to defend yourself.<br> <br>However, it's perfectly understandable that you disagree with the pill test, and it was quite obvious that's all that the reason was when I read your final words. Unfortunately, that was too late.</p>

                <p>Doesn't matter if I think the ship has awesome people and can make it to Eden, if I'm Mush, it's my job to make the hunt exciting and mysterious. The game wouldn't be much of Mush if nobody ever tried to play it. Admittedly though I sometimes dislike the role because it's not in my nature to betray people.</p><p>And yes, Gioele did try to kill us <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> I realized it when I read his last words, something about blasted Aracks and how lucky we were. It confused me at first until I realized he had the Hacker Kit.</p>
