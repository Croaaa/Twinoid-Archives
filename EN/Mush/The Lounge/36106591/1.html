                <p>This intrepid reporter woke up among a pile of other quickly thawing bodies. The ship's clock announced it was D1C1 and we had best get to work. Hunters were detected on the scanner and mush DNA was suspected aboard ship. Everyone began quickly filling up the intercoms aboard ship. In just 90 minutes we had over 300 conversations going. I used my amazing IT skills to help relay the antimush research along. It went by so quickly that we finished AntiSpore Gas and Canstaspore Serum by the end of the cycle.</p><p>Camera's were set up, items for icarus bay were moved out of storage, and general ship business began in earnest.</p><p>With the research finished I the great Mush hunter felt confident that the mush would be playing the long game. Chao began torturing people who were dirty, or had gone to the dorms early. My initial suspects were Terrance and Stephen. Mostly because they had left the lab first to go do ships inventory. But i didn't have much to go on.</p><p>My suspicions were quickly squashed about Stephen. In the course of Chao's interogation Stephen was badly injured and contracted Sepsis. We just barely kept him alive by some emergency surgery. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/survival.png" alt=":mush_explorer_1:" class="tid_ico"> This marked him off my list as the first confirmed human.</p><p>Suspiciousions were flying back and forth, Chao and I had opened a private chat to talk about who to go after. Chao then tortured Finola, and then went up to the bridge. It was around day 2 and Chun made a group of people that Chao had tortured. What happened was a 6 hour discussion of convincing everyone Chao was mush. Chao had gone into medlab to torture Finola. He was the only other person in there besides Stephen. So when Finola got dirty we knew something had to be up. The captain was dubious and urged caution, but Chun cornered Chao in the Icarus bay lept upon him. She didnt have the energy in her to finish him off but Stephen woke up just then and came to finish him off. With a knife clutched in his hand he was soon covered in Mush gore. Our first confirmed death was indeed a mush. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> Day 2 Cycle 4 Chao left us. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This left me in quite a konundrum! The mush hunting team was now cut in half, or maybe i should say it was that way since we all unthawd. As the hours ticked by i once again started to believe that the second mush was going to stealth the game and play human. My days were filled with patrolling the main corridors and following up when crew members wandered off the beaten bath. The only one i could not check on was Raluca. A death sentance had been pronounced by her to any who entreated upon her domain without permission.</p><p>We had several Expoditions each day, often flying to a planet and doing an landing then immediately flying out of orbit. Crew members were getting checked off my list left and right. Even as many of the crew had vowed against mush testing. The constant expo were making the crew get sick, and the need for AP ment people ate as much as they could. By Day 5 my list was down to just 4 people. It was also at this time our two biggest losses's occured.</p><p>We lost the drill during an expedition. The second mush decided to act, they knew the noose was tightening and we had completed the serum the day before. Un-noticed by anyone Frieda took the grenade from icarus bay after the last expo and went back up to the bridge. As we sat in space after leaving orbit she made her move. She ran over to Janice, spiked her and transfered into a new body. Having dropped the grenade and comm gear, Frieda/nowJanice ran down to the Alpha dorm and threw the grenade inside. Chun was killed instantly, everyone else gravely wounded. Fully unmasked she taunted us and ran about the ship.</p><p>Thankfully i had the foresight to hide the serum in the Front Storage room a few cycles earlier. Mush Janice was now standing right outside it. The crew was screaming in confusion and the *cough* Terrible lag days were fully on us. Minutes passed as room changes took effect. Gioele was trying his best to kill Janice in the hallway as i entered with the serum. The look of dread passed upon the mushes face as i pushed the needle into her neck.</p><p>The damage. Chun was dead and Janice was now a much lower level character. No more diplomat, and Frieda was also not very high level. Frieda was also plum mad at having her memories swapped. But the crew bolstered itself and we pushed on. I went up to the bridge and tried to Print the list, but Neron in an irritated voice informed me the list was no longer needed. The ship was clear of MUSH.</p><p>The decision was made to stop research on the mush soap and make the white flag from it. We needed a way to stay out of combat. People would just have to learn to take showers without their favorite shampoo. Being mush free i dare say some of the crew grew into lax hygene behavior. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/stinky.png" alt=":mush_stink:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We found our first Starpiece around day 10 i believe. Fortune favored us with several more quickly, and by Day 13 we had computed the coordinates of planet Eden. I must say that i was in favor of warping early and enjoying the fruits of our success. But the crew as a whole wanted to glory on. We had more research to complete, and the Mad Kube to work on.</p><p>Oddly hunters did not bother us much during the voyage, i consider this great proof that our brave pilots did their duty in fending off these fiends. We also moved about so much, that the Mush had no opportunity to lock in on us. But with all the great manuevers cost the ship great, by day 15 the ship was starting to truely fall apart. Fires <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"> began raging and destroying key equipment. The many drones that Terrance built could not keep up with the failing systems. I stopped planet scanning entirely to play nurse with hope of humanity gone.</p><p>Janice now cured of being Mush was pushed into bed sitting and patting shoulder more often than not.</p><p>Due to RL vacation <em>Stephen</em> died around this time from Morale loss. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>By day 18 i was starting to make winky eyes at the male section of the crew. Eden was just around the corner and Terrance was the first to jump this booty. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> Much fun was had in the Medbay. Kuan Ti, don't mind the stains. They are for humanity. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>My greatest achievement this game. Flirting with every male member of the crew except for Chao. And of course getting 2 good <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">//Kanoodles//<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> in the Medbay.</p>

                <p>Captain, Commander, eater/chef of countless Jumpkin and Alien Steak Filet Mignons Jin Su here:</p><p>This was a great ship, really pushed the limits of efficiency, team spirit, and everyone playing to their roles. ... For the most part. If anyone's interested here are my ship scheduling/activity, project slate and mush investigation notes (you can mostly tell who lived in which time zones although their reference of german, french and playing the french Mush gave a little away in that regard as well): <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ApYTcaMX6w8TdHF2bXA3eGNBNTNjZnBaVXYyQWR0ZEE&amp;output=html" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/p...</a></p><p>Oh, and I found our 1st and 2nd expedition logs: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/2943" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/2943</a> <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/2987" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/2987</a></p><p>I started the MMM as Jin Su not really knowing what to expect, I had captained only one other time before on a ship with at least 3-4 important inactives and only 2 explorations (don't remember if it was a single planet or two) but a dramatic ending that had us landing to Sol with minutes to spare with a mushy infiltrator Ian guarding front corridor.</p><p>I certainly didn't expect to hit a whopping 18 planets by day 16, discovering/freezing enough alien steaks to feed 5 ships worth of crew and only stopping because our drill was carelessly lost on a planet without a Hydrocarbon zone (though there was a shipwreck and we did happen to find it... ON THE SECOND TRIP) &lt;see expedition 9 pts 1 and 2&gt;. That's right, after we lost the drill we still managed to hit up 10 more planets before dropping to a halting 2 fuel (1 was needed to exit orbit), thanks to the efforts of our three invaluable pilots, Roland, Hua and Terrence, with Frieda and I sometimes subbing in as necessary. There's no way we could've jumped so many times without their tireless efforts to rid the skies of Aracks and scrap collect for upgrading our life-saver drones: Lobito and Banjo.</p><p>Special thanks to the bridge crew, the unfortunately transferred Janice who had to fill in for the deceitful but serum-converted Frieda, Paola who worked most the cycles in the day and took the time in her schedule to stay up/wake up for our cycle 1 Rebel Base transmissions and chowing down on at least a dozen rations + banana + jumpkin to update neron all the way to 10! (9?), Kuan Ti with the planet scanning luck of some sort of rabbit's foot-fourleaf clover hybrid, and Gioele our 2nd half coffee-fueled astrophysicist relief pitcher. Oh, and Eleesha, who probably burned too much AP planet scanning when suitable candidates were already up for discussion <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>The tale from my perspective: Hopped onto MMM at like 4:01 from my smart phone, there were like 50+ messages waiting to be read, and a roomful of cheerful crew waiting for me to blather on about something banal like a post-freeze chocolate cake party to boost their morale before they manned their stations. The mush hunt was on, from that point, with all three of our lab crew being Bronzes (Chun, Finola and Ian) I thought that our research capability would possibly take a downturn, especially since we only had Finola with a research bonus. That fear would be allayed by Eleesha, Stephen, and Gioele's (and I'm sure many of the other front crew's) efforts to relay efficiently. Chao began a swift investigation/torture of the crew members who had been dirty or had left the lab at some point during D1C1- Terrence and Stephen took razor-sharp blaster bolts to the gut, with Stephen needing surgery as a result, as well as incurring an infection (Sepsis) to bring our publicly confirmed human count to 2 (Stephen and Chun). I suspect Chao was hoping for a headshot in one of those 4 blaster shots he took, which he would then blame on RNG, as he was recalcitrant and vowed to never shoot the blaster again in his torture sessions except turned on a confirmed mush.</p><p>Things were quiet for the first couple days, projects took an extra strange turn (at least from my NERON priority values) when we took the Large Bay (up to 6 on an expo) over Neron Participation and Launch Propulsion [someone with better memory correct me if i'm wrong], but the veteran rear crew assured me that this was for the best in a 14 active human ship. We were gearing up to go to our first planet and I, as Jin Su, watched intently every blip on the iTrackie trying to catch Mushy goings-ons in the corridors. I would not get so lucky, but instead, found myself in this conversation with Chao, who had gotten into a verbal scrum with Finola and Chun after he had invaded the privacy of the MedLab to torture Fin (despite some pretty vocal warnings against going in there). The context was that I was sleeping/observing B-Dorm where our soap/non-dismantled shower was when Fin arrived, picked up and dropped the soap twice, and stated a flimsy reasoning while checking into the dirty thread: take a listen.</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"> : I was -gonna- rat on Finola for claiming dirty eating ration + picking up/dropping soap twice in B-dorm but then Chun corroborated to her eating. *grumbles* I'm anxious to see when the real mush will slip up</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Chao</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"> : I just said to Eleesha, that i`m a little worried that Finola and Chun may be the same player, they always get online at the same time, and Chun is always protecting Finola with Claws and Teeth ....i ll keep an open eye over Finola and would be great if you guys could...I don`t really trust the fact that she was hurt, or the fact that when i torture her twice, i got 4 identical actions...this is a easy way to break the torturer skill utility ... ~5h</span></span></p><p><cite><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Chao : Why would someone repeat the same useless action 4 times if not to break my torturer skill? ~5h</span></span></cite><br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"> I think they may be friends, but not the same player.

That said, we're likely just creating doomsday scenarios out of a pair of bronze players who are just playing sloppy.

If we shot her and tortured her now while she's in B-Dorm (if you even have the points to do it) and we're -wrong- then we'd be accused of being mush and likely lynched. It's not like our actions so far have been blameless. I didn't start talking until D1C3 because I joined on a smartphone while busy with a friend, and the incident with you and stephen was sort of harmful for your rep ~5h </span></span></p>

                <p>1st mush intrigue cont'd: <br>Chao eventually threw out some more accusations at Janice and Paola, who I defended on the basis of my AP tracking efforts (if you give 4 lab relays and build the couch and fuel the ship you're not gonna have enough AP to spore up during that trip). Eventually sleep/work caught up with him and he had to afk in Icarus Bay to help get steaks.</p><p>At this point I had invited Eleesha and Paola to hear these whisperings and conspiracies because of how much food/nanners they managed to chomp down between the both of them. Finally, in D2C8 as the crew was about to take the Icarus off to reach planetside, I was brought into Chun's mush crusade private channel where I got the backstory to all the rumblings from Fin + Chun's perspective. Fin getting randomly dirtied on cycle change (which would be pretty solid evidence that Chao used <strong>SLIMETRAP</strong> on her) and Chun + Fin's effort to create the ration alibi to not create a panic or make Chao go on a preemptive rampage. I, however, was still not yet ready to believe that our zealous Chao was already dead inside and there had to be some other explanation that exonerated both of them. I refused to take part of Chao's killing and, as a result, I lost some major face in front of the "bloodthirsty dictator" Chun, who would prove to be shadow queen of the ship during Day 3-5.8 as everyone seemed to kowtow to her for rooting out the first Mush.</p><p>As Jin Su, with my authority preempted it was a hellish 3 day stretch, I had gotten booted from (well, everyone else left) both previous mush hunting threads. I had gotten a psychological disease <strong>weaponphobia</strong> from witnessing Chao's death but there no beds available with Janice for me to try to demonstrate that to the rest of the crew, I was knee deep in Chao's plot to destroy the ship by passing the blame on Finola + Chun being a griefer pair, and almost worst of all, I had gotten on Chun's bad side for chain of events leading up to Chao's death:<br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">I'm picking up the knife so that it won't be used against the crew that will be onship during the exped ~2h</span></span><br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Chun</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"> &lt;paraphrase&gt; Drop the knife Jin, I'm going to kill Chao right now!!! </span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"> I'm not going to kill Chao until you bring me evidence beyond a shadow of a doubt that he's mush! You still haven't given me that evidence, you've only proven that Finola's actions are somewhat explainable. At this point i'm 95% convinced that Finola's telling the truth, but that doesn't give me full confidence to just kill Chao right now, there are so many ways we could try to sneakily test him, to see if he lost his Wrestler ability or whatever, just give him a few cycles to explain himself! </span></span><br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Chun</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"> I'm killing him now, either drop the knife, use it, or get out of my way! &lt;she uses blaster charges and punches, hitting maybe 2-3 times in total&gt; STEPHEN KILL CHAO </span></span></p><p>In the aftermath I was isolated, standing in a dorm, with no whispers open other than our pilot coordination thread. Stephen had grabbed the knife that I eventually put down in a gesture of negotiation. One more far-less-than due process crusade accusation by the trigger-happy Chun and it would be my head rolling on the floor.</p><p>Just because I love hearing myself talk and imagining the nightmare scenarios that could have created a murdership in my absence, here are some of the wonderful things that Chun would suggest/rashly act upon during her reign as shadow queen:</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico">Upon the Genius'ing of the Serum, no less than 4-5 out of left field accusations against Ian, Roland, Terrence, Raluca, and Gioele, even going so far as to plan out a scenario where we (without any Eleesha list or any illness-based evidence) would stick Raluca (human) with the serum and kill Terrence (human) if the mush counter had not gone down. She presumably based these accusations almost solely upon chat activity and circumstantial evidence (Roland had jumped with Ian on a ship that ended just before MMM where he attested that he was a lot more chat-active in his previous role). <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> I was asleep for 2 cycles, had announced it in our planet scanning threads/made clear my intentions to jump us when I woke up/ Chun decides that's way too slow and wastes <strong>at least</strong> 15 crew AP on trying to 1) Hacker kit the ship while there is an Arack outside, 2) read the Pilot book and shoot down the Arack WITHOUT announcing that she shot it down 3) Roland flies out because he didn't know the Arack was already taken care of. 4??) Eleesha had a try at hacking it too. What a cluster^&amp;%$. I woke up and jumped us to our planet and just shook my head. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> She "lost track" of where she put the hacker kit on our 2nd, 3rd or 4th expedition.

                <p>Stephen here, back home now from Mexico. Around day 4/5 my girlfriend said "let's go on a trip!" and my fate was sealed by day 7 I was on my way. Luckily for the crew I had decided to play a non-essential crew member for my first MMM. My hotel had an ancient computer in the lobby that sort of worked but wasn't reliable. I had planned to log on everyday to keep myself fed and healthy but between the spanish keyboard, the alcohol and you all being so prolific with planetary missions I didn't get much done. I've told my SO "No surprises" for next month. I think I'll take a crack at someone more valuable in March.</p><p>After performing surgery on myself when somehow the crew was convinced I had been healed, I had no problems killing Chao though evidence of his mushiness was shaky at best. The rest of the crew told me that the mush were dealt with but I cracked. If Frieda could swap into Janice's body then maybe there were others. I couldn't trust anyone and curled up in Icarus bay with my trusty knife....</p>

                <p>Roland here, I was having fun shooting down hunters from day one and was very pleased to see such a full lab with so many actives and over 300 messages in the first hour or so. <br>Our Chun Tyrant was scary and demanding through out the most part and the death of Chao made her even more so. I was very early on shut out of the trusted loop and was apparntly considered mush until the almost day 5 where i had to consume twice to get the hunters down to a reasonable level. <br>Chuns hot headedness cost up alot of AP in trying to jump ship for no reason and then running to read the pilot book that we were reserving for a more well equipped player such as eleesha. That cost me alot of ap running around the ship to take off and kill hunters when she had already gone out and not comunicated it. Then she got blown away by the body swapping Janice/Frieda and we lost our temporary pilot. After she was gone though things seemed to go much more smoothly and we had a great overall run...Too bad we lost that drill!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Friedice (mush Frieda <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/frieda_bergmann.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FB:" class="tid_ico"> ) here. Had a feeling I might be mush, so I only chose two skills, Astro and Pilot. First MMM and first time being an Alpha Mush. Frieda was only lvl 2, but I would have had enough XP to get her to 4. Mush was only lvl 4 and I had enough XP to get it to lvl 6. Wrote up what happened as the days went by, ironically, I wrote in Derek by pure coincidence before he was ever mentioned in an update. So, here's what happened in an RP-ey kind of way, including some personal comments:</p><br><br><p>Where am I? Why is the reporter standing here with me? What was her name? Eleesha? This room...I'm on board the Daedalus. And this queasy feeling in my bones, oh how I have yearned for this. The feeling of Space. Gioele keeps looking at me funny. Like I'm about to croak or turn wild any moment. Both hope and fear in his eyes. What happened the last few days? There's a hollowness inside of me, I can't quite place it. Something is missing and I need it back. <br>Eleesha filled me in. I was Mush. They got me. How? I still remember most of what happened on Xyloph-17. Jin approached me to navigate this boat three years ago. It must have been at sendoff. Derek and Nils are not here, one of them must be the leak. And Baranov that sleazebag. Chao is gone as well, we had...the mush had him.<br>I see myself walking towards me, angry and stomping. Only, that's not me anymore. That used to be my body, but the mush did a bodyswitch with Janice. I had a new body now. A new life to live. Look at that, perky boobs and a round ass again. Stephen called me Friedice and the other one Janieda. Janieda was angry, babbling on about some lost glory. She does not seem to know what body she is now living in, being an accomplished astrophysicist is way more than she could ever have hoped to be. She throws some crumpled up sheets of paper at me and storms off again - she seems to fault me for all these mushy actions. Well I'm not changing back. I'll <strong>definitely</strong> get a haircut, but I'll keep the rest. <br><em>picks up the papers from the floor</em> A diary? What's this about? Did I go Memento on myself? Wait, that movie is a thousand years old, no one is gonna recognize this reference....</p><span class="tid_preCite">Day 1</span><cite><p>Argh, out of cryo. Finally. All of the fleshbags are here. Where are Zaklorak and Th'Kmathlo? I cannot sense them but there is someone else, he infected the security officer, "Chao" <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/wang_chao.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_WC:" class="tid_ico"> . We curse the fleshbags and are in desperate need of a grenade or two while all of them are here. I'm sure 'Kma and Zak would have liked that. We decide to lay low for now. The minute I walk out of the lab I track a scent of vanilla. Vanilla. I feel weak. They know we are here. Chao and I need to spread paranoia. He tells me they are going crazy as it is anyway; apparently their tracker "Goldielocks" <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/eleesha_williams.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_EW:" class="tid_ico"> , their psychiatrist "Elvis²" <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/janice_kent.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JK:" class="tid_ico"> and shipowner "McScrooge" <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/gioele_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_GR:" class="tid_ico"> want to see heads rolling. Believe me, you will.<br>Taking it slow, we decide on Chao torturing people. Besides being immense fun, we can create some panic that way. Like nearly killing "Handlebar" <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/stephen_seagull.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_SS:" class="tid_ico"> . It was so close. "Doctor OCDopus" <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/finola_keegan.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FK:" class="tid_ico"> even did our job for us, surgeon of death giving "Handlebar" another injury while trying to heal his liverdamage he got from Chao torturing him - ok, he may have shot him as well. These things happen, right?. Chao did his best to cover his tracks, I decide to stay out of it for now. I try to throw "Wheels" <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/terrence_archer.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_TA:" class="tid_ico"> under the bus (hrhr, get it?), telling "Patient X" <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/zhong_chun.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_ZC:" class="tid_ico"> he wanted to waste a skillbook, which she could easily verify with the other pilots. He had valid points for us to read it but it can still be seen as kind of shady, so I hope he'll get some actually discriminating stuff on himself to implicate him. In the meantime I'm gonna pretend cryo got the better of me and slow down their planet scans. They can't possibly do anything without a proper navigator around. I'll give them shitty planets and when the time is right, I'll sabotage their expeditions. I heard Mankarogs can be quite deadly for these meaty gnats. Oh the fun. <br>Chao has another idea, maybe we can lure "Cmdr Cape" <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/kim_jin_su.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_KJS:" class="tid_ico"> to stay on board instead of doing an expedition and for me to transfer into him, getting rid of the expedition and killing off 5 human weaklings. Weak links? Whatever. <br>Suddenly I get the urge to watch hawks fight horses. Perfect excuse to get away from these dilettantes.</p><span class="tid_wspoil"> I friggin' knew it. First time as alpha mush on my first MMM ship. Screw you, RNG, screw you. I <strong>literally</strong> punched a wall out of frustration <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico">. I felt so bad for Chao. Since I was Frieda, there was no way for me to get dirty and extract spores or help him in other ways. We think about taking traitor and slime-trap to confuse them a little bit, I try to slowplay scans and find a really deadly planet (volcanoes plus mankarogs on a small planet maybe) and take them out, when they can't do anything about it. I immediately scrapped that idea once I saw Jin was smart enough to check the planet after every move. Since we had antispore, constipaspore and two projects down in the first hour of starting the ship, we knew this was gonna be hard. On top of that, Chao had chosen wrestler and this could have easily exposed him, which is why he tried to shoot people using his free shooter points as an argument. Day 1 ended early for me, since I went to watch the superbowl. Let's not talk about it. All I can say is, it was a looong night and I was not around for most of the action that happened the next few cycles.</span></cite>

                <span class="tid_preCite">Day 2</span><cite><p>Hawks dominated horses. Who would've thought. I got caught up in this massacre and was out for quite a long time. <br>I've been drooling all over myself. How I hate these gnats. Their brains are so small, no wonder it turns to mush after a few days of liberating them of their evil thoughts. I can't feel Chao anymore. They seem to have found him. He told me "Elvis²" was onto me and he tortured me shortly before he died - just in case. That hurt. And felt good at the same time. I wonder if the humans know of this kind of pleasure. <br>Chao is gone. I will avenge him - they will be sorry to have ever raised a hand against our kind! Their evil must not go unpunished! I will take down this ship and my clan will remember my name for all of eternity! "The Saviour of our race"? "The Protector"? Maybe "The Slayer of Evil". I bet there will be movies and songs about me. Maybe a holiday named after me. That does sound nice....<br>But first, let's see <strong>HOW</strong> I can take them down.<br>If they are actually onto me, I need to validate myself as a worthy member of their crew. I scan for planets but apparently these idiots flew to the last crap piece of universe there is. Not one viable planet for them or me. How am I going to get in their good graces with these shitty circumstances? I need to up my game, while still delaying them. A little delay here and there and it might not seem obvious. So far I haven't gotten dirty and I had no interaction with Chao. I'm debating whether or not to tell them of this torture. It might implicate me even more and it could also clear some suspicion. I decide to go for it and being a model citizen. Every fiber of my being tells me not to do it, though. <br>The humans are talking about a "cure". As if there is anything to cure. Like they'd ever get to use it. This ship will be dead long before they ever get a "cure". And they are talking about me as well...oh. They want to use the cure on me? Well come and get me. The only cure you will get is death. That'll cure you from your petty existence. They don't know anything about us mush and are trying to get a genome disk from Xyloph-17. I need to tell them to shut it down. That Carlsson. I knew he was going to be a problem. How can I contact my superiors? I can't feel anyone nearby and they'll notice me activating the comms. Although...their connection is lost. I might be able to contact Eld'Krogdod without them noticing pretending to connect to Sol. I risk them getting the disk, but at least I get more credibility. <br>I threw out all of the other guys on the bridge. I was alone with that "PinkMarge" <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/paola_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_PR:" class="tid_ico"> . She's doodling little hearts on the comms interface all day. My god I want to kill her and get it over with. Now that funny-looking commander came in - what is it with humans and capes? - and might be able to take away my AP from the pink-haired dodo. That means one less planet analyzed and more suspicions on me. I try to get him to leave in a private conversation and he suggests giving me a ration instead. Oh no.</p><p>He is onto me. I know it. He knows I won't gain any strength from their weird food. This is not going well at all. What do I ...he left? Thank god, he left. I can stop worrying for now, but I'll have to think about their fleshy needs in terms of hunger and morale come tomorrow.</p><p>My planetscans so far have been...less than fruitful. I wanted to use the "I failed to analyze anything"-excuse upon eating...but I have to do 3 tries to find a single planet as it is. This is exhausting...</p><span class="tid_wspoil"> So I come back after being inactive for quite a while - I sucked up nearly all of the AP from Paola's logistics - and I find Chao dead. Grrrrrrrreat. One against 14. I do not like these odds. I immediately decide that I will honor Chao and go out in flames. I will do my best to thwart their plans of going to Eden - giving up and being cured is second only to 'shooting-people-and-taking-vital-stuff-onto-the-Pasiphae-as-soon-as-you-turn-mush-<strong>because</strong>-you-don't-want-to-play-mush-even-though-that's-the-name-of-this-game-but-you-are-too-much-of-an-idiot-to-play-it' in terms of boringness. For now all I can do is wait for them to get paranoid, which they are keeping to themselves, far as I know. Transfer seems to be a nice idea, though I'm not sure how I'll get the most use out of it. We'll see what we can do about that...<br>Enter Jin Su. Holy crap. I thought you had me. I thought you KNEW I was mush. I did not know what the hell I was supposed to do. I told you to get lost so I can get Paola's logistics again and finish the stupid scan and you told me to eat instead....and then simply left. Thank god.<br>And of course the RNG is still f?!cking with me. Two times in a row I fail to get a planet even though I have 99%. This is just ridiculous. </span></cite><span class="tid_preCite">Day 3</span><cite><p>I need to keep up appearances. Weakly fleshlings tend to hunger so easily. I need to blend in just like James Amanita in "From Encelade with Love". So I'm <br>gonna get me some Romanova. Or what was that Stroganov? Whatever, I go to the refectory and get me some of that. I walk into the lab, take the apron as the <br>good girl I am, eat, put it back down and get to the bridge and pretend I failed to get any good planets. So far, so good, let's hope "Patient X", "Hippie" <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/ian_soulton.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_IS:" class="tid_ico"> and "McScrooge" saw me eating, all of them were present.</p><p>Morale. I pretend to need comforting from "Elvis²", who seems to have some girlscout badges in communication. Hm, that seems kind of handy in terms of handling alien life. I don't like it. I think I'm gonna need to disable that, somehow. But for now, I have kept up appearances with food and morale.</p><p>Oh, the humans think they are smart, huh? Speaking in code about "that thing" being in the lab, huh? I have achieved true UNAGI, I have nearly full AP; there is nothing you can do..."Eleanor Abernathy" finishes the serum and...nothing happens. They have no clue about me! I try to contain a laugh but cannot hold back any longer and start dancing. The humans are still snoring in Bravo Dorm, so they don't even notice. Oh, this is soooo gonna be in the movie. It's a gonna be a musical scene with Neron and I. I'll get the younger fungi that way. And the weird ones as well. Or maybe something along the lines of "Let's build a fungus" - fungus because there aren't any snowmen or cannibals around, duh. I love it.</p><p>At the end of the day, we have another expedition coming up. Hm, seems we have a <strong>traitor</strong> on board. Nothing. No artifact. Nothing. Illness. Illness, Illness. And "TheComedian" is lost! Rejoice in life! This calls for another dance scene. Of course, I immediately tell them that I will bravely risk another expedition to get "TheComedian" back. Because I only want the best for the ship. Also, because my treacherous ways just might kill him. Oh, I'm happy to go down...except he's already back with us. Damn it, this can't be Tru, man. Someone is messing with me here. Next time, then. It was a good start, I ruined a perfectly suitable planet.</p><span class="tid_wspoil">So, yeah. Took care of morale and food, and once again the RNG keeps screwing with me at every turn. This is just ridiculous. <br>I was very anxious when Raluca finished the serum but I had nearly full AP and knew Ian was in the other dorm - and he seemed to be online exclusively at c8. Perfect opportunity for me to maybe kill the people trying to inject me, injecting someone else and then seeking refuge near Ian. Only, none of that happened, because they had no clue about the mush.<br><br>Oh my, the expedition was fun. I jumped up from my seat filled with pure joy as Roland got lost. I thought I might have the chance to kill the first human here. <span class="tid_sideNote">Little did I know the expeditions would turn out to be my downfall.</span></span></cite>

If they keep this up they will destroy another planet with their evil obsessions and they <strong>will</strong> come back to Sol. I cannot let them escape.</p><p>Countless planets have been nothing but dead waste. If only they had been deadly waste. Alas, I keep on searching for another opportunity to kill them and we find an acceptable planet. I have few AP left and decide I do not to go to the expedition, I may need them later on for some bloodshed. Or a "rescue" mission. "Cmdr Cape" tells me he is sure I am human but some people don't trust me and want me to leave the bridge - apparently he won't have enough AP to join the expedition either. Oooooh, interesting. I can work with this. I put on my gameface and tell them I want Jin to leave the bridge as well - he probably isn't mush but the mush could transfer to move the ship. He tells me they have taken countermeasures against this, he will be standing guard in Front Corridor. Oh my. This will be Daedalus' reckoning, my friends. This is what the third act of the movie will be about! The hero gets the chance to sacrifice himself for his kin! It's still a few cycles left till the expedition and I'll be at nearly full strength. I'm feeling giddy already. I have to assume that this is some kind of trick, though. They might put a second guard there, probably "Goldilocks" or someone inept. Ooooh, this is it, finally.<br><span class="tid_wspoil">Now at this point I realize I won't be able to do anything that cycle because I had to go to class at exactly that time. </span><br>Dammit. This will be the second act of the movie after all, the first confrontation and something our beloved hero has to manage to get the vital knowledge for act 3. You see, my agent just called. Yes, I already have an agent. Nobody seems to care for the comms much, so I contacted Xyloph and told the Eld' where we are and the SDF are on their way. I got a chance to hire an agent as well, because, you know. Reasons. <br>He thinks it will be hard to do a publicity tour being dead and all, so he tells me I shouldn't go for it. I think that doesn't sound very heroic but he does have a point, I don't just want the fans to love me, I want to enjoy life as well, so I can't risk losing my -Ned- head too much. So I won't kill them during an expedition after all. <br>Instead of going full Stamper for my folk, I opt to be the helpful human scum they want me to be and try to stick around. I continue to spout worry over "Cmdr Cape" being anywhere near the bridge and show them how easy it would be to transfer into him and ditch the Icarus. Humans are easily frightened when it comes to maths, so they agree and see if they can get their beloved Commander onto this expedition after all. I don't like that they consort with each other behind my back, to be honest. I have been trying to rile up their circle of cool kids for a couple of days - to no effect.</p><p>Seems maths impresses humans even more than I thought. "Goldilocks" invites me and a few other to a little teaparty. She tell us we are human and she suspects the last mush to join the expedition - I did not know that. She is willing to initiate us to the inner circle provided we deliver proof of us being humans - I did not like that. Some of them are willing to gulp down on food and will eagerly show their barbaric ways. I, on the other hand, have no way of proving this. I try to get out of it as gracefully as I can, it goes something like this:<br>Goldilocks: "Would you like a little bit food?"<br>Me: "Well, I haven't had any yet, so I can't very well take more."<br>McScrooge: "Ah, you mean you can't very well take less."<br>Goldilocks: "Yes. You can always take more than nothing."</p><p>So, including their trusted crew of ~7 players and the five of us at the teaparty, there aren't many people left. They are circling me in, even if they don't know it yet. I assume they have their eyes set on "Elvis²". Well so do I. Her girlscoutskills are still too much of a hassle to keep it around. Thing is, I can't get rid of it by using "cure" on her. However, it would be nice, if the cure were not around. They will have secured that with Chun keeping serum and the hackerkit, if I'm not mistaken.</p><p>Expedition is on their way and it is equally as bad as any of the expeditions I took part in. So far so good. And then, Bam, "Elvis²" gets ill. All of my dreams squashed. They know their mush is one the teaparty, two of whom have already proved their vile humanity. Not good at all. I need to act soon, I don't think I'll have many more chances. Screw my agent, I'm going down in history as a martyr!</p><span class="tid_wspoil">Class. Of course my education is trying to f?!ck me as well as the RNG. I was so sure I <strong>HAD</strong> you. 6+ people dead would have been awesome. Also, two pilots and Janice gone.

Screw this.<br>I was very surprised to hear from Eleesha - at first I though she knew one of the teaparty was mush and she accused us, but no - she was indeed going for Janice, who wasn't part of the group. And then got sick. Greeeeat. So I know they have narrowed it down to Raluca, Gioele, me and maybe two or so they are still unsure of. Unlike them, I have done nothing shady like looking for hidden stuff and so far have done my best to blend in, if I do say so myself. <span class="tid_sideNote">Only later did I realize how true this was, while I was always on the suspect list, I was barely a prime suspect, the others were screwing up just enough for me to go on unnoticed</span></span></cite><p><span class="tid_preCite">Day 5</span><cite> <br>So I find another few planets for us and try to keep my AP even more than I already did. I find a few shitty planets, nothing I could use to kill the horrible gnats. Nothing to get them lost. But one planet to get in their good graces. Maybe they'll take the cure and ram it down someone's throat that way. I need to set up for my eventual doom. I already know what I'm going to do if the brains hit the lawnmower. I'll ....no, I won't tell you. That's the climax of the movie after all and we're not there yet. I take mental notes of all the weapons and person. I may have to satiate my hunger soon, so I could get a spore or two...if only the apron wasn't around. <br>What? The apron had been gone for hours? The fat pilot took it? Aaaw, hell to the no. This was my chance to get dirty. Oh woe is me, to not have seen, what I should have seen. F?!ck. Now it's back and I won't have an excuse to get dirty. <br><br>Ok, not that bad. I'll get another chance. Let's go do this expedition, maybe someone gets lost after all. Illness, Illness, Illness, nothing, fight, Illness, fight. I feel like this <strong>Traitor</strong>ous thing is more of a human thing than a mush skill. We get back from the expedition and I find myself with full HP a grenade in one hand, lizaro jungle in the other, two blasters lying around, while the rest of the crew only has about half their strength left. You'd be dead if I wanted to. I chant my woosa-mantra and decide to let them live. I'm a merciful god. <br><br>Back at the bridge, I realize: I am a stupid god. It dawns on me, that every single one of these slimy meatbags has been sick already. Except for me. They should have figured that out days ago. <strong>I</strong> should have figured this out days ago. Damn it. Should haved the used the grenade earlier. There is no way I will live to see my home again. I'll be gone by end of tomorrow. I need to do something. My backup plan will now spring into action. <br>Here's how it is gonna go down:<br>1. Get back into Icarus Bay to get grenade, Lizaro Jungle and blaster<br>2. "Patient X" is sleeping in one of the dorms. I'll take the grenade and the big gune to shoot her down. <br>3. "Elvis²" is with her in one of the dorms, spore her, transfer and take the blaster to kill "Patient X", if she is not dead yet.<br>4a. If "Patient X" does have the cure, take it and inject it into the nextbest idiot you can find - ideally "Cmdr Cape". Kill him, if you can. Then kill some more. <br>4b. If "Patient X" doesn't have the cure, get to the showers. Taunt them a few more times before setting the water to a nice steamy "Instant Death". Save your race by dooming the ship.<br><br>Yes. I'm going full Stamper. I will sacrifice myself to save my kind and I will let this ship know true pain. I will kill "Patient X", she seems to be the one they all listen to, so they will lose any hope and structure they have left and she is a valuable pilot as well. The girlscout tricks won't help them finding a new habitable planet any longer, since the tricks will be lost as well and they will slowly die of morale. They will surely try to do it shortly before dying, but it will be of no use. They will die and the universe will be rid of the horrible, violent pest called humanity.<br><br>Man, I'd watch this movie. The twist with the shower? Genius. Just imagine everything going well and the hero dying last minute nonetheless and willingly sacrificing himself. Damn, that is some tartar-sauce. Wait, tartar-sauce is for fish-sticks. <br>I have been watching the tracker for over an hour, nothing big happened and no one spoke a word, so far. Someone has been trying to load fuel for over half an hour and doesn't seem to know how it works. Janice has been inactive for a few cycles and should have racked up enough AP for my plan to work. <br>Yippie-kay-yay, motherf?!cker.<br></cite></p>

                <p>Hm, the mush must have written out their plans. Only, I am still alive. Chun didn't have the cure and this body did not have enough strength to get to the showers. God, what an obnoxious little creature. <br>Well, let's see how this pans out now. We have found the cure. We can get back to Sol to get rid of the mush and establish a new order. But right now we would be overwhelmed by mush. We can't go back yet. <br>People seem to come to me for comfort and guidance. Seems they need my years of experience. Or they want to take advantage of my new-found youth. I certainly do and am joining most of our expeditions on foreign planets. Seeing all those beautiful landscapes filled with green and blue valleys, golden shimmering waterfalls and animals in all shapes and sizes make me glad I am still alive. And I get to live another lifetime.</p><p>3 days go by and we find the first clue for a new habitable planet. The others want to find out more about this planet and by day's end, we have a second piece of the map ready. Two days later - day 11 - and we have all the information needed to go to our new planet. We continue to fly around in space, for a few more days, hoping to find other civilizations that might help us win the war against the Mush. <br>We might be able to mass-produce the cure, if we can get some help. By day 15 it's pretty clear we won't be able to find any other civilized species, who'll help us - every single one of them denied us, saying we are to brutal and this might be our just deserts. I urge the crew to fly to Eden and gain some strength before we lose another one of our members - we had lost Stephen shortly before. He was apathetic and did not respond to us at all. He was waiting in Icarus with his trusty knife and shredded any predator he could see - we had a massive amount of steaks on most expeditions - but otherwise it was like he wasn't around at all. <br>The crew did not want to go "Eden" - that was the name given to this planet - they said we might find some allies, if we just keep on long enough and they might join us admiring our braveness to conquer the vast space. Only, we couldn't keep going much longer. Our drill had been lost on an expedition and our fuel was running low. If the mush had indeed contacted the SDF - so far, we didn't see many hunters following us- we might not be able to stay in space for much longer. Battling fires, electrical spikes, mental breakdowns and the SDF on our trail, we finally decided to go to Eden just short of 20 days. But it felt like 20 days.<br> <br> _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _<br> <br> So, who can find the all the weird and unfitting TV/Movie references in this story? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> ...and No, i didn't proofread any of this. fearpills is pressuring me into posting this unfinished <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br> <br> I wrote most of this as the ship went by and added the last few days a few minutes ago - this story isn't finished in any way, which is why it has no inherent style, theme or flow <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> ...but I don't think I'll have the time to work on it with exams coming up, so here you go. After all, I was very anxious to hear from you as well and I wouldn't want to let you wait a few more weeks.</p><br><br><p>All in all, I had a lot of fun on this ship. I would have had a lot more, if my mush had been a higher lvl, but I'll take an Eden win just as well <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> It was my first MMM ship and the first one to last longer than 10 days.<br>...ship started out SUPERactive the first two days. Two hours gone and you had to catch up on over hundreds of messages. This kind of simmered down after the mushhunt. People fell into a certain rut - and we were very lucky with this rut. I had a feeling half of you were online only about twice a day but it all just went together perfectly. We always managed to rally an expedition and we certainly kept up poor Jin far longer than he wanted to(or was that just me? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>I feel bad for Chun and Stephen, though. I killed Chun as a mush and Stephen died of depression while being on a vacation, as he already mentioned. He must have had a few panic attacks, I tried to comfort him daily and was going to comfort him the cycle AFTER he died. Should have gone a cycle earlier...And the rest of the team seemed kind of ok with being rid of Chun, which was very weird <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> ...but you can read up on her reign of terror from the others <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>With a total of 5 pilots we had no problems with hunters at all, the hull was always 80+. 8 bumpjunkins in our garden got us our fair share of food and oxyygen. Everyone did their jobs splendidly. I loved Stephens hilarious comments and Kuan Ti's beautiful audio logs for our expeditions.</p><p>So yeah. My perspective and a short summary of what happened. I might write a second entry with all the thanks and things I missed here. I might <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>
