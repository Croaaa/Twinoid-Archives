                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/13371">The End</a></p><p>Hello,my name is Ianice! I started out as Ian. Activity levels seemed high. Before full ship, a tutorial Paola who reached bridge was traded for a pot. The other tutorial player, Gioele hadn't left the lab. Raluca had been moved out of the Nexus by Stephen (to be alone). Projects progressed along nicely. Raluca used genius on plasma shield.</p><p>The ship filled quite quickly late day 3. I was chosen as alpha mush with Frieda. She puts two spores on Raluca in RC, on day 4. Research was very quick and CS was completed. I made the mistake of choosing Fertile after I extracted the first spore. I had 8ap to account for. I managed to convert Raluca and take anonymush. Showered but decided to eat my second spore. I used two MTPasses! I was in BD and made the excuse that I needed a hug from Janice. She provided a couple. Then, I took a bed in AD.</p><p>Raluca was seemingly inactive, but she did come back online. She got herself dirty starting Pilgred. Derek assassinated her. One mush down, but only one appearing on the bar!</p><p>The starting planet had oxygen on. Filled tanks up. Oxygenated ducts, hydroponic incubator, and 6 plants should have meant we'd be self-sufficient on oxygen for a while.</p><p>Frieda heads to the bridge, and finds a planet. Cristalite. Jin Su was injured in several roomshakes I witness. I also get plated. Frieda heals me, and Hua who also was in AD. Frieda is commander now. Eleesha received a spore from Frieda. Just before day change, Frieda moves us to the planet.</p><p>We were planning to see what the cristalite zone gave us but we never did get an expo going. Research was zooming along. I had added a few ap to the research (chose to appear as bronze, botanist only - if I was human I was thinking of being frugivore too), and did water/treat when I could. 6 plants need lots of ap. I think one of Ian's mistakes was going to look for the broken equipment - both fuel tanks were broken and I don't think we had moved to Frieda's planet by then. Quite a few people seemed to be visibly human from roomlogs (double eating, or doing stuff, eating and doing more stuff, or from purchasing super vitamin bar - Stephen did that), so perhaps it was just a process of elimination.</p><p>Anyway, I was heading out for the night, D6, and said I would not be able to do plants in c8. Instead, I watered and treated a couple in C6. I come back just before day change but decide to just relax. Shortly after day change, I notice I am down a few hp. Chun has decided to slice me open, but she tears her tongue instead (it showed in the room log). I contact my alpha partner and say I may have to rampage. She's resting in BD, along with Roland who wouldn't have much ap, and Janice. Frieda suggests I transfer, and as soon as I do, she'll head to the bridge and finish converting Eleesha (after all, she's one that could say if there were mush, if the list wasn't already printed). I chose Janice. Ian showered and was down to 1hp. Chun had also injured Ian with a haemorrhage. Ian had removed the camera. Before I can say to Frieda to let Ian die at cycle change (although brainsync was done, I don't think the player I swapped with would be online), she attacks and kills him. She I think forgot about needing more ap to attack with Ian in the room. Looking at the room log, perhaps some would think Ian transferred into Frieda. Frieda had spoken before the transfer, so if you ask - why didn't Ian say anything, an answer if you saw the roomlogs where Chun attacked, maybe the knife destroyed Ian's ears.</p><p>Anyway, we have to wait until cycle change for her to convert Eleesha. She does, two spores but forgot about the hidden mycoalarm. Eleesha is online. However, so is Derek. Derek then proceeds to kill both Frieda and Eleesha. Three mush dead, none remain on the status bar!! So, am I free?</p><p>Inactivity plagued the ship. Stephen was inactive in the lab, Roland went inactive in BD, and Hua returned from inactivity in AD. Terrence was a tech who didn't say much until Eleesha's death. He had deliberately chosen to play braindead, although he did eat bananas on day 4, and something subsequently, and access the lab (probably relaying). He starts Pilgred.</p><p>Andie is comms manager but fires on the bridge damaged the consoles and the D7 rebel base was lost (wolf and sirius lost, centauri left undecoded).</p><p>Kuan Ti was now commander. He was new, but I couldn't tell him to give me missions. I did try to be as neutral with him as possible. He worked well on projects, and we went through all but three.</p><p>I hugged people. I watered plants. I tried to match Janice's activity where possible.</p><p>An oxygen tank was broken and had not been fixed for at least a day when another broke and Hua fixed both.</p><p>Hunters were down to 6. Plasma was holding, then a massive wave of hunters came. 20? Then another 3? I decided then, with an inactive Roland + apprentice pilot gold Stephen, Hua would be unable to cope. I noticed earlier that the grenade had been dropped in the garden, and knife + armour were in RC. I extracted my fertile spore on way back from putting fuel in for whenever arack was down, Kuan Ti could move ship. No one bothered with the hunters.</p><p>I decided to grab the grenade, throw it in BD where Terrence, Derek and Roland lay. I knifed Roland to death. Derek a few slices. Then went to take a bed in AD with Hua. I went off computer and was hoping I would not need to use ceasefire then. I attack Hua once and try to sleep in C2.</p><p>I check on mobile (not puffin) and find I was down to 1 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">. I call ceasefire (as that works without flash). Terrence, then Hua attacked me. Would the ship kill me? In the end, no! Derek dies while I sleep. There are two fires. 29 hunters now, plasma breached, hull 59%. Pilgred was about 47%? What should I do, I wondered. I could take pilot lock off and fly out with extinguishers (done that quite a while ago, not satisfying). I do take pilot lock off, turn plasma off (the 5 shield regeneration each cycle did mitigate some damage, as did a trader out there), death off, food on (there was a huge pile of bananas due to Heat Lamps - got instead of Blaster Gun). I put the weapons and the two fire extinguishers in the nexus. I ate a spore to heal to 5 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> I then decide to mutate in RC, and am now at 10 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">. Chun got lucky and killed me with 6? hits.</p>

I converted Eleesha under myco-alarm because it's pretty obvious either way. Don't remember you offering to use deface in game, but maybe thats my bad.</p><p>Feel bad for Jin Su. Kept insulting him and dismissing his good ideas to try and make him look like the bad guy and distract from my mushyness hahaha. Can't believe I got you guys to skip Blaster Gun also, if someone wants t skip BG 9/10 times they're a mush!</p><p>Glad to see the ship go down in a blazing fire Ianice, nice work mush team.</p>
