                <p>Maybe I'll tell the story. It's probably better if I do, anyways, given that I was in the know for longer.</p><p>So TE had a large public jump and I saw a lone TE member on a ship who I seemed to match with. So I pop in as Kuan Ti. The people seemed relatively fun despite a Terrence who questioned our need to roleplay (though he was relatively polite and backed down quickly). I wanted to make my Kuan Ti a "Disney Princess" which I didn't really have time to do, sadly.</p><p>Selection happens and our own Don Chaolioni lays down some simple warnings. The starting book was not mentioned (but it would later be revealed why) and the sample was quickly found. I decide to grab Designer and Astro while hiding the fact that I can take Leader and Tech for safety purposes (also Politician, if need be), I quickly inform Chun of this. My first decision was to focus mainly on research and only use NERON points for projects at the start. I start by putting a push into projects and waiting a few to see if someone could relay (nobody did, coordination would be a clear issue as many of the crew appeared once/twice a dayers) then I head up to do research only to find out that Stephen had forgotten to drop the apron before logging off. I opted to, instead, build the sofa for Paola.</p><p>Very very little happens for a while. Chao gets dirty from coffee and Frieda gets dirty from loading fuel for her O2 planet. I sat there wondering why Chao would even need coffee AP but it wasn't suspicious enough for me to narrow my focus. Frieda takes her place by the bed beside me.</p><p>A few cycles go by and it's C8. The commander decides it's high time to get to Frieda's planet and he turns the ship and sets off. I contract Slight Nausea from the move, it was about 30 minutes before day change. I message Chao who had taken the medikit in order to heal a tortured Hua, hoping maybe he was still online to heal me as to prove my humanity. He wouldn't respond so I asked Janice who had recently acted (she also seemed fairly trustworthy), Janice would inform me that Chao had dropped the medikit in BD and didn't want to enter. I decided it wasn't too important to stress my illness any further as I don't care to prove myself too early.</p><p>We approach the end of C8 and I see Frieda stand up 2 minutes 'till change and remove the camera. I panicked a bit and opted to scream out in the public chat rather than flee. By the time I got the idea to flee, cycle change had already passed. I attempted to get up and run to the door but the screen refreshed and I was Mush. To be honest, I thought Janice would've been the target given her skillset and the fact that she was talking closely to Chun (or made the impression of such) but I had started with a spore so it made sense...</p>

                <p>I awoke as a mush to a Frieda turned Terrence. Terrieda was asking that we kill Frieda as fast as possible. I disagreed and told them to be mindful of the fact that Raluca was hiding Genius (I noticed this earlier as she had Tech, Phys, and Designer). I pull them into a pm in hopes that not enough will be revealed for fear of Pheromodem; I knew Terrieda was not going to survive this. Hua and Gioele announce in public chat that they had seen a convert on the mush bar, I expected as much given the number of actives we had at the time. Meanwhile, Jin Su rushes in and kills transfer victim Frieda (Jin Su was inexperienced).</p><p>Chao becomes active and asks if I could bring him a ration as he was dry on AP. Chao had previously had a physical altercation with Hua after she tried to murder him for going too far with torturing, prior to the events of day change. I agree and rush over to the refectory, puking the whole way there (I then realized that my nausea hadn't cured itself over cycle change). In the refectory, I noticed that the other Alpha, Ian, had left a nice surprise. Two spored rations. I get excited over this in the pm with the two but Ian told me that it wasn't triple spored. I sigh but bring Chao the double-spored ration, anyways. It takes him a little while to eat it (turns out that it was double spored) and he and Gioele quickly dispatches Terrieda.</p><p>Now came the moment where they would have to figure out who got converted. There were only two possibilities: myself and Janice. I make it known that I had been throwing up. I got a message from Janice in pm who made a comment of being relieved that I was still human due to throwing up. I remain quiet, I wanted her to think that I was suspicious of her (I wanted to seem as legit human as possible so I could bring up the possibility that the other alpha might've made a move elsewhere while everyone was distracted by Terrieda).</p><p>Then Chao speaks up in my private channel with him where he told me that I <strong>had</strong> to be the one who was mush'd (I don't think he knew mush can't get sick, though). I tell Ian that he was going to be a problem but that I'll handle it. Frieda was a smart cookie and had installed the camera in some far off room so AD was still unprotected. I make a comment to Chao that I was going to trace Frieda's footsteps to be sure that the camera incident wasn't just a ploy to misdirect us from the real convert. I step out to the Nexus and draw a single spore then move back in AD and spiked Chao, I would immediately take anonymush, nobody noticed.</p><p>I work at diffusing a public message that Chao had posted immediately before I converted him, a message that directed the finger at me. I tell him that I had been throwing up and mush can't get sick. He seemed to accept this (as now he was mush). Gioele, on the other hand, was knowledgeable and made mention that Mush can keep illnesses if they are converted with them. I give a simple "This is true" and not say anymore. I did not want to push the subject any more than I had to for fear that they would either raise an eyebrow at me or get violent with Janice...</p>

                <p>"Why not push to get them to kill Janice?", You ask? Well, it's simple. It was clear one of two people were converted in AD. If one possibility is removed from the equation then it can only be the other. I couldn't let them kill Janice so an idea pops into my head. I pull Raluca into a private chat and make sure to sound sure that Janice was the convert, giving the impression that Frieda's death had made me ill. I reveal that I know that Raluca is hiding Genius and tried to help make her feel at ease by telling her that I, too, was hiding skills for the good of the ship.</p><p>I started to discuss with Raluca the plans to get the mush disk and cure Janice, using glamorous words like "A shrinkless ship is an Edenless ship" and other things like that, really trying to drive it home that I was human. She seemed to agree for the most part. I could not risk going to bed and waking up having been cured by Raluca or having noticed she decided to genius Phero and used context clues to figure us all out (Frieda and Ian had not been using PM prior to my mushification). I also told Raluca that I wanted to keep the crew guessing on who was converted as not to "scare Janice into acting" or provoke the crew into killing Janice.</p><p>Things calmed down. The crew had no leads on the alpha, were confused on the beta, and had no idea about Chao. I had time to think. We were at a planet that was legit safe despite Frieda being mush, and O2 was at a good 12 or so. Ian was a very low lvl mush and Chao was... I dunno, I never knew despite having asked him twice. I wanted to convert two people at once with a glorious sex-tuple infection using transfer and infector. I dismiss that idea later as it would require us to wait a whole two days to gain enough spores. We opted to wait for someone to eat Ian's other double-spored ration (it would later be cooked, I cried on the inside).</p><p>The ship would later have an issue with a wave of hunters. One pilot had wasted all of her AP retaliating against Chao (Hua), another pilot wasted his AP murdering a transfer victim (Jin Su), and Frieda and Terrence were dead. That left only Roland, who had a starting spore to clean things up. His activity was shaky for the first day. I decide that I wanted to look more human and do something so I went and useless fired from turrets, using the excuse that I was dirty (I forgot to mention that Terrieda had dismantled the last shower). Roland would come on the next cycle and finish the hunters.</p><p>As time continued, nobody spoke about the expo. The mush team watches the oxygen counter drop and decided to mold themselves around killing the ship that way. About two cycles prior to Day change, Raluca brought up the expo, stressing the urgency given the 8 or so O2 remaining. Chao brought up the idea of killing Chun while the others were on the expo, taking the hacker kit from her body, and leaving them (and the O2) behind. I didn't like the idea but I can't always be the mastermind and told him I'd back him up if the opportunity came around. Meanwhile, I proposed backup plans...</p>

Once C1 comes around I would get commander title. I would go load fuel, redirect and spike Raluca once on my way up to move the ship, then go and spike inactive Finola and transfer. As Finola, I would grab oxygen, go double spike Raluca to convert her (transfer resets your skills) and then ceasefire in AD.</p><p>Two things were certain in my planning:<br>1. We needed to stop the crew from getting O2.<br>2. We needed Raluca dead or converted (she was the last non-mush tech and hiding Genius).</p><p>Chao goes silent once C8 comes around. The crew prepared for the expo, I was hoping and praying that they wouldn't set up before 1:10 minutes left in the cycle (to make sure the expo wouldn't be done before day change). Thankfully, Jin Su would hold them up until about 50 minutes 'till. I count my AP thoroughly and come to the conclusion that I wont be able to load fuel and redirect myself to spike Raluca. I start asking Ian if he would be on at the very start of C1 to load fuel, I feared that Raluca would be quick enough to catch me loading fuel and would remove it before I got to the bridge. Ian was silent... For 40 long minutes I spent in a panic. I had spent the ridiculous amount of Exp for Politician, there was no way I could let this opportunity go by. I hastily rethink my plans...</p><p>10 minutes until day change... I told myself I would go and grab politician at 5 minutes (in case any prying eyes looked in on me) and head over to initiate it at 3 minutes... Gioele walks in. I panic harder, he was fully active, watching. I knew he was going to be an issue. Meanwhile we have Roland, Janice, Raluca, and Jin Su all talking openly in public channels. So many people active! None of them were my partners! I bring down my go time to 1 minute in case Gioele chased me.</p><p>1 minute... I pull my testicles from gut and rush to the Nexus where I initiated Politician. I opted not to spend the next 20 second to scramble for a BD bed (I worried Gio was in hot puruit already). So I kept rushing to the fuel tank, trying to cover as much ground as possible before people catch wind. Day changed as I moved to the storage, I ended up with the commander title but I didn't stop to look at anything. I grabbed TWO fuel and put them both into the reactor, in case any heroes would take out one fuel and not notice that I had injected two.</p><p>I immediately turn and rush to the bridge, pulling one spore out. My brain decided I would convert Stephen, he's an apprentice, a potential tech. Now guys... I need you to understand that what I'm about to tell you isn't exaggeration... Every room I entered on the way up to the bridge I saw Gioele. It was a horror-movie esque chase. He had blood in his eyes, I picked up the pace, probably leaving a trail of magnificent (yet sweaty) glitter. I get to the bridge and move the ship first thing. I think immediately spike Stephen and rush out of the bridge before I got melted into a dapper puddle of KT from Gioele. I then sprint to medlab and spike then transfer into Finola...</p><p>Gioele was in the medlab with me. I scream and flee. I no longer wanted Stephen, he wasn't active, he wasn't good enough. I needed an active convert <strong>now</strong>. Ian messages me saying he had loaded the fuel, it seems he had been listening to my planning but never spoke up. I pull two spores and go for the only other possible convert, Roland. I go and double spike him, I had lost Gioele from that point. I still kept moving, though, I didn't have ceasefire up yet. I go to CBS and see that it was broken already. I laugh and run to CAS. I grab three oxygen and then decided I would use some of my remaining AP to try and break the tank. I succeeded first try and rush to AD where I ceasefired and finally got to relax in the bed.</p><p>Ian faithfully decides to come and join me, followed quickly by now-mush Roland... And that's where I'll let Blackgem take the reigns on the story as I lacked a talkie.</p><p>Again, sorry it's really long!</p>

If I was human, I would've never brought him an uncooked ration, especially when I had quite a bit of AP ( As evidenced by me stating that I was ready to relay research on C8 ).

                <p>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br><em>blackgem falls from sky</em></p><p>From my human standpoint I was a little less active, Star-Trek binging in real life with only my phone to check Mush, and I can't really keep up of events on Mush with that. I was enjoying ship, there was a little RP and I was my favorite character, etc, I had confirmed expo, was excited to play my pilot role there.<br>Then I hit 'refresh' and POOF, welcome to cause, you're a mush blackgem. I was half 'oh'/YAY, wanted so bad to be mush for awhile, and I dashed to my PC 'Fred'. I was not sure who had infected but was not surprised it was BadBlanket, so I dashed to the AD where Finola said she had her ceasefire. I took a bed and noticed that Eleesha was standing, Ian arrived and took other bed. Of course people noticed, Janice was saying that I had been double spiked, and then. I started. The bologna thon.<br>I started spouting nonsense. First the typical 'not a mush' thing. Actually that continued. Everything I did was half-way confusing, and meant to be, I hoped I would confuse newbies, make experienced players doubt, and hopefully make everyone do O_O. Meanwhile we schemed. Chao wasn't really very reliable, but we knew only chance was to take out Raluca, she could finish PILGRED and was smart. So we schemed ways to do so. First, I would transfer after spiking, taking out Raluca for us, but we decided that was out. Oxygen was low at this point and Finola had grabbed some before ceasefiring, so we had this also. I forget all the plans that we made then, finally we decided I would transfer to Janice after spiking and continue the ceasefire with my diplo. I also wanted as little AP as possible for that, so <strong>green jellied</strong> the research terminal, comms, a drone, NERON and planet-scanner.<br>Next cycle I went out, extracted, dumped my iTrackie, and found Janice - ceasefired! The humans had a ceasefire too, and I couldn't transfer to her now, so I got iTrackie and returned to AD. We decided I would transfer to Stephen and apprentice, but once I transferred (dumping iTrackie in CAT), he had already done so. I couldn't copy, and so our ceasefire would end.<br>Well, I went to bed, and when I woke, several were dead. Chao had earlier killed Chun, and had been killed (after engaging in some bologna too), but Ian, myself and Finola were all there. Finola decided to kill, mutated and took Hua, but couldn't finish Raluca. By then 8 hull and 21 hunters, my calculator would take 41days to actually figure up the odds here, but we were going to die today.<br>Raluca geniused Natamy, took out Ian (Finola had been killed too), and I was alone. I hadn't spoken since transfer and was skilless. Then Raluca PM'd: "Who did transfer now?" She thought I was the TRANSFERREE. That was favorite.<br>So I picked Gioele, imitated his speech, and attempted to be Gioele, but I really didn't care if she caught on. She'd told she was out of AP, I was gonna die when exploded. So I even acted a little silly and talked about spaghetti dinner.<br>Finally as 5 minutes to cchange arrived, told her I was Roland by RP'ing a bit, acting 'me'. I hope I explained the thing well enough, favorite part was bologna, but the humans fought hard and well, mush had a lot of fun hopefully! I sure did!<br>Oh and thanks everyone for the RP. And for not getting mad at the bologna.</p>
