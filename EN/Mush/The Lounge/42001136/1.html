                <p>Hello, KT here. My mushpatriot Derek requested an AP thread so here it is.</p><p>We were watching you guys try to fight it out as ghosts and I just want to say, great try! I was actually worried that you might pull it out of the fire at one point. But losing all pilots and technicians, then getting everything slime-able slimed plus me hiding the wrench, was just too much as it turned out.</p><p>It was fun for me at KT because I'd wanted to try the green slime strategy for awhile now. I think it's a pretty good ability. I don't think I will even bother leveling up my mush right now, going to do characters first since besides for OP defacer, the later skills don't look that useful to me. Mushification is of course good too but I'm not in a rush to get it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>What did you guys think of the ship?</p>

                <p>Hi, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/derek.png" alt=":mush_derek_50:" class="tid_ico"> Derek there.</p><p>I killed 2 important people: Roland and Raluca. Why?<br>I killed Roland because he's just visited Bravo Dorm just after Mush selection, and no scrap collected. And I was jelious that he was the only person whose icon I don't have. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br>I killed Raluca because she hated me when I offered her to do the thing. I promised to kick people in Bravo Dorm out for her after she told that I'm the only person who understood her. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br>I killed both of them because I hated these gold players, they were 3lvl gold players and I had bad experience with gold players. As Roland was the only pilot, I helped crew and read that Pilot Mage Book to replace Roland's duties. And don't worry about technician, we have shower dismantled, of course Kuan Ti was another technician, and he dismantled a shower for you. He helped you with killing inactives who could wake up and kill all of you, so he killed Hua and Terrence, to help you. But he didn't kill Eleesha, and it was a mistake, sorry Stephen. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br>But Stephen killed the last pilot and the last technician, such as a griefer, to make this ship harder. He didn't even allow our 2 biologists (devoted polyvalent and frugivore biologist) to make RFS and didn't wait for miracle. And Eleesha noticed this kind of griefing, and killed Stephen.</p><p>The crew wanted my die, the only pilot. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> I predicted this reaction, and brought the armor with me, and knife, which may be used to kill the only hopes.</p><p>I miss Gioele. Just after I killed 2 suspects, I tried to find Ian, and I hoped he was in Alpha Dorm. There was 8 other people, so Ian should have been there, but he wasn't. I was exhausted. And when I was staying in Alpha Dorm, Gioele left Alpha Dorm, walked around the ship and told in public that got exhausted finding me everywhere, and he couldn't find me, <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> stayed in Bravo Dorm because there was free bed.<br><span class="tid_sideNote">Logs in Alpha Dorm:<br>D2C4 - Gioele entered the room, Chun visited the dorm, picking the Blaster up, and after my murders, I entered the dorm. Gioele took the scooter and left the dorm. Ian visited the dorm to take Soap and entered again to punch me: <em>hit (2)</em>, miss, block and left the dorm. Chun enters, shoot-miss, shoot-miss, shoot-block, and left the dorm. (It's sad she didn't get injured. Janice the best one: miss, <em>hit (1)</em>, miss, block, block, <em>hit (3)</em>, miss, <em>hit (2)</em>, block, miss, block, miss. 12 attempts without eating.<br>D2C5 - Kuan Ti enters the dorm, drops the scooter, takes the wrench, Janice's attempts at me: <em>hit (2)</em>, miss. (yeah, she's got Paola's logistics) Kuan Ti left the dorm, he enters the dorm, I dropped the knife and left the dorm, Kuan Ti picked the Knife up, and attempts at Hua: <em>BOOM!!</em> slit-miss, slit-miss, <em>slit</em>, <em>death</em>. I entered the dorm, tried to pucnh Janice but missed and Kuan Ti took the scooter and left the dorm.</span><br>That's sad Kuan Ti as you noticed there were <strong>2 grenade BPs</strong> after that. With 3 grenades Mush Victory guaranteed, killing half of crew so easily, and depressing the rest of them. All morale support were there.<br>Chun was also funny. Both showers dismantled, Chun got Gastroenterisis and dirty because of it. She washed herself in sink, and got dirty again. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> And surprised that she couldn't wash herself again. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>And Stephen, who didn't think what to copy with his Apprentice skill. He didn't copy technician skill. After killing me and Kuan Ti, half of ramaining crew praised him, treated him as a savior. Gioele got desire to continue playing when he noticed the hero of this ship like Stephen, and then Stephen got assassinated. It was funny for me in Mush's eyes how hero dies.</p>
