                <p>First off, <strong>Hua</strong>. So many times I wanted to shake KT when talking with you. I'm glad she had the patience to put up with his vanity and philandering ways to get the magnificent that goes with it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Started out with using nearly identical PMs to proposition Hua and Frieda since they'd shown themselves willing to engage. Shortly after, gave them both the same post-it note with song lyrics propositioning a one night stand. (Would have kept giving it to as many as would read it because KaT is classy like that, but Frieda took it with. XD) Imagine my dismay when Hua responded with a profession of love! And later, again sending Hua and Frieda the same message about giving them expedition yarn to find their way back to the Daedalus if they got lost.... I'm glad Hua realized that perhaps accepting KT's advances would have probably meant he searched for the next person deserving of The Kuan Ti Experience™. Instead she became a friend and eventually much more, catching KaT's heart. That might even be enough for when he realizes monogamy will likely now be expected of him! XD - In case you can't tell, immensely enjoyed our RP!<br>Also had a lot of fun having KT panic when he started falling in love :3 - <a href="http://i.gyazo.com/2dc5ad6e83a33541dccbf1cbc32acc64.png" target="_blank">http://i.gyazo.com/2dc5ad6e83a33541dc...</a></p><p><strong>Jinny Boy</strong>! <em>GOOD GOD YOU WERE ENTERTAINING!</em> And active.

                <p><strong>Janice</strong> was having none of KaT's game, right from the start - <a href="http://i.gyazo.com/b994bbbe1424430b849290063ad797e7.png" target="_blank">http://i.gyazo.com/b994bbbe1424430b84...</a><br>Not that that stopped him from trying! And eventually becoming highly offended when he tried to approach her in private as a person and she insisted on trying to 'fix' him as a patient. I really enjoyed the barbed interactions between them afterwards. I also enjoyed Janice for not being the image of a perfect shrink, as many tend to play her - she totally judged KT, and her personal dislike of him was blatant even though clung to professionalism... and I adored that, even if KT didn't. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Made her very real. I'm sorry we didn't end up chatting more - curse a lack of adequate number of PM tabs!<br>Your NERON was pretty badass too. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Andie</strong> - loved your Andie RP. It seemed very fine tuned; I'd have thought you played Andie a lot more than you do. ^^ KT was charmed by Andie's passion, conviction and brilliance, but their sleep-wake times were completely incompatible for 'satisfying biological needs,' as Andie put it. Hence, Kuan Ti's second friend, and an excellent one at that! Taught him a bit about friendship, and a lot about love! He probably wouldn't have recognized his feelings for Hua as what they were without the chats with Andie, and listening to her drone on about Derek. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> <br>I stand by KT's statement that Andie will end up leading that Federation of hers one day. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Chun</strong> please don't smash me, okay? Enjoyed your mix of intelligent mostly OOC posts and IC CHUN RAGE SMASH. Although, Chun's response to DTT with KT seriously bruised his ego even as I was cackling - wish I'd saved it, was something like 'CHUN LIKE LONG CAPE MAN. FUNNY LONG CAPE MAN MAKE CHUN LAUGH.' Andie and I had a little chat about that which I think will amuse you - <a href="http://i.gyazo.com/a7cca3226a329d8efb0d343f7494034c.png" target="_blank">http://i.gyazo.com/a7cca3226a329d8efb...</a><br>Also, just have to say, GOGO GADGET HEALBOT!</p><p>Didn't really have much one on one interaction with <strong>Ian, Raluca, or Gioele.</strong> Although distinctly wished I'd opened a tab and approached Raluca more than once; she seemed fun.</p><p>Everyone did their jobs and then some fantastically, so not going into that, more just addressing the RP and player enjoyment side from where I'm sitting. Seriously, you were all brilliant.</p><p>Honorable mention: <strong>Paola</strong> - sad Gioele decided to kill you. It was definitely the lack of ration AP. The others in the know wanted to cure you if at all possible, but Gioele decided that the risk of rampage wasn't worth it and took action on his own.</p>

However, I will say that <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> opened up a PM with me a few days before the ship ended, and we had some back-and-forth about how I was feeling, being a simple lab rat and nurse surrounded by people with so much more skills than me (even though I'd lucked out and a Shrink book made its way to my hands, so I had more skills than usual), and it was a really great chat. Thank you so much for that, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico">!

                <p>Your brilliant and absolutely insane Commander here! This was my favorite ship thus far! Lots of fantastic personalities, lots of fun and a ton of teamwork! We worked extremely hard to get that far and tried to push everyone above the top rankings for their characters. A few of us fell short due to the bumpjumpkinitis that 6 of us had, otherwise we had it dialed in. My Jin Su was... Not in the norm... He was in his own little world and perceived everything vastly different from the rest of the crew. He was also one who got himself into many otherworldly situations like chasing a cockroach menace, frying rats, destroying medlab's chandelier during a freaky night with Raluca, and going through an epic boss battle to make KaT too magnificent to cure him of his head sick. It was definitely a comedic act.</p><p>KaT - Jin Su's rival! They had bouts of who had the most magnificent cape! Yet, despite their bouts, they understood each other better than the crew did! Of course, KaT could never beat one of Jin Su's speeches, leader or not!</p><p>Chun - Jin Su was scared of Chun... She was scary... So happy you decided to continue on for the sake of the rest of the crew. I knew you were growing tired of the constant healing and babysitting. Despite that, you let the crew have their fun and worked harder than ever! Thank you!</p><p>Raluca - My love! From the start of the game Jin Su treated you like a disease! Accusing you of having "The Crazy" aka "The Weird"! Then, oddly, you approached him in an act of love. I laughed so hard at the irony of it that there was no way I couldn't accept! Jin Su then believed he was the only one immune and sent Andie missions (With his blood smeared on the paper for research purposes) to find a cure! Also he ate your cat's poop calling it chocolate... Yeah... Jin Su is a special boy... Also <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/LVaaqC8.png?1">this</a> happened. Jin Su and Raluca have the wildest... "conversations" with each other.</p><p>Gioele - You were fairly fun in the beginning but I have a habit of netting people into conversations. When we were both sitting in the refectory, both with logistics, I had Jin Su forcefully label you as his best friend! Despite the screaming every time the refectory door broke (which was like every cycle) and that Jin Su watched you sleep while giggling... You were great fun, dude! (Still my ship)</p><p>Frieda - The senile old lady! There wasn't too much interaction between Jin Su and yourself but he ordered you around hardcore! I loved watching you interact with everyone, I laughed so hard at how sassy and kinky your Frieda was and I look forward to seeing more of it in the future. Carry on, Bergmann!</p><p>Ian - SOULTON!!! There was nothing more entertaining to me than to have Jin Su screaming at you for every little thing! You were like the disappointing middle child who skipped school and brought home a C in Physical Education. Congrats on your new job, it distracting you really made Ian live up to being free spirited, hehehe.</p><p>Hua - You amazed me quite a few times with your hunter wave predictions! They started showing you up near the end, there, though! You were great fun and I loved listening to yours and KaT's situation! Congrats on being in the top rankings, too! You do our ship proud!</p><p>Andie - I loved giving you missions so much! Giving you random, completely strange tasks throughout the ship! I loved when you responded to them even though you eventually stopped. =( You were absolutely amazing, though. When you got that comms officer title you got Neron up to like 12 updates! Definitely one of the main reasons we got as far as we did! We would never have been able to have gotten that far with Paola or Eleesha on the comms (especially Eleesha)!</p><p>Janice - You were fantastic! Your sassy NERON chiming in to make the crew feel sorry for being alive! The way you helped keep everything organized and assisted Chun with healing and hugging! your back forth with Kuan Ti was entertaining as hell. Jin Su was all for treatment for his special head but it probably would've driven Janice crazy. One should not peer in the mind of Jin Su.</p><p>I thank you all so much for being on this ship (Even Eleesha because without her we wouldn't have gotten Andie onto comms)! I hope you all enjoyed me as much as I enjoyed you. When I came back and saw everyone on the bridge in that last cycle I was moved. Most of you were to be asleep that cycle but every single person was up there, it was fantastic. Rainy's photo isn't as good as <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/ZPwV860.png?1">mine</a> because we're all facing forward shouting "Cheese!"... Well... Not Jin Su he was spying a dot on the wall and preparing to pounce. He never did catch that cockroach...</p>

Played casually for about one season a few years back and picked it up again around a month or two ago.

Little did I know that it would become the other way around!<br><br>First ship. Went through the tutorial as Gioele and thought, well this seems interesting. Learned about mushpedia, died shortly after. Perhaps mushpedia was to blame. 7 days and 94 glory. <br><br>Second ship. Played as Chun. Intrigued that on top of the game mechanics the social interaction between players could actually be entertaining. A shorter ship than the first one but immensely more entertaining due to trust, betrayal, love triangles, and an epic Hollywood ending with explosions and intercourse between the last two survivors. 5 days and 70 glory.<br><br>Third ship. My first time trying RP, turned Ian into an anti-pacifist puppy-killing veteran. Mindblown that RP was more fun than anything else in the game. Most active ship so far, very unlucky with planets. 16 days and 235 glory, made it to Sol. Did not actually kill puppies.<br><br>Fourth ship...</span><em></em></p><p>...was the most entertaining by far and I can't believe how lucky I am to have been on this ship! The RP from you guys blew me away from the start, I had no idea it could be done so well. You guys had me literally laughing in the middle of the night on more than one occasion despite my best efforts to keep it down. It didn't help that I imagined our captain Jin Su's voice as a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h42d0WHRSck">character</a> (<em>*warning, has some semi-realistic violence!</em>) from TF2, one of my favorite past games.</p><p>I wish I could do a player by player summary like you guys did but unfortunately this is my offline cycle so gotta head to sleep. 12 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">/ 9 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico">, will be back in...oh right, it's over...<em>Sniff</em>. Really though, every single one of you were so awesome and you truly deserve the freshest of fish cookies.</p><p>Thank you so much for everything guys, had a blast and I would never have made it this far without you. And a special thanks to Rainy for providing me with a pass and for inviting me to this awesome group! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

Level 12 on Neron Upgrades. I think this must be some sort of record. S/he was always there for us, expeditions, healing, research, piloting...

You were by far the coolest <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"> Frieda I have ever played with ! As everyone before me said, I loved your sassy-ness.

I was secretly hoping for a little magnificent Kuan Ti Junior on the last day, but oh well. At least we will have the jumpkins to care for.

I appreciate your patience and I hope for many more fun trips in the future.

Thinking back, you were killed because you got dirty running to fix a useless door as soon as it was reported, then you were resistant to a request to shower even though you were in the shower dorm and should have had plenty of AP to do it. The resistance- especially after getting dirty on something there was no reason to bother with- made it look like you were lacking AP because spores. And then you did this weird thing of picking up the soap and lying down and standing few times instead of just showering - looked like you were trying to see if someone was online to medikit check you for shower damage, to either assess whether to take spashproof or try to shower-phagocyte quickly enough. Seems like you were just being intentionally uncooperative? I was going to ask you to print the list at the new day and see if anything else shook loose before killing you. Got Chun veto'ed though. She was pretty convinced you were mush due to all that and you not having communicated any suspects to her or much in the way of hunting despite lvl 5, and she didn't want to wait for a rampage. It's too bad, but I couldn't say it was a bad call on her part given how strongly I thought you were mush too.</p>

Generally, refusing to shower will get you in deep water, period. Even if you did decide to shower the stygma is there. Yeah, I'd call it a mistake because you were human but if presented with the same case again I'd probably still make the same choice (it was both Chun and I who pushed for a faster resolution). We had no suspects for a while which made us come to the conclusion that the mush were doing their best to look human. We had to put everyone back up as suspects, even the ones who did research (which you only did a bout of research once or twice within the 4 or so days you were alive). Then you did a classic mush move of fixing something unimportant to get dirty then went so far as to get away with staying dirty from it. When Mush are dead staying dirty is preferred for characters like yours as it increases productivity without having to worry about losing AP to showering (which is what I believe you were thinking) but when they're alive it makes you a very outward target. As a lvl 5 gold Eleesha, we couldn't look past the possibility that you had showerproof or even infector. We had no leads on your ally, could've trapped someone without us knowing and you could've been about to rush them with infector, we decided to act on that fear and, despite you being human, worked out for the best (no offense, of course). Eventually it took Paola eating and us realizing she couldn't have to catch the first mush. The second one was pretty obvious but the hunters didn't want to act so fast because of what happened to you and we ended up... well... I can't say we paid the price because nothing really happened as a result of his rampage but it could have turned bad if properly executed.</p>

                <p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico"> here!</p><p>Thank you everyone for my greatest journey so far! Although my own level of silliness and craziness isn't so high as of some others and I prefer more down to the ground and darker RP for my own characters, I really enjoyed all the hilarious and funny things that were going on. Very much. Beside others, Jin Su missions were sometimes piece of art, and since it's shame I was mostly only one to see them, here you can find all of them: <a href="http://pastebin.com/kuvs7Jjt" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/kuvs7Jjt</a></p><p>I'm just sorry there were times when I felt kinda isolated. At first, it was difference in time zones, that made most of the things happening when I was asleep, made the research relays and organization of expeditions harder (thanks to Raluca whose schedule was most close to mine and who was able to help with the research in those problematic cycles 4 and 5, when I was most active and mostly full af APs) and generally made me feel like on the ghost ship some days. Working on comms on bridge didn't help much and there were days when I didn't left bridge and front corridor and had no idea what is going on anywhere else, and European DST messed my schedule pretty bad in the second half of the trip. Also, all those surely funny posts I missed while browsing quickly through tens of posts at the morning trying to find the important ones before the end of cycle!<img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"><br>But well, nothing can be perfect and it's no-one's fault. And it got much better in the final days when I got back into dorms and was able to help with general maintenance of ship and crew <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So thanks again, hope we will meet again soon with any of you, be it on TE jump, castings or just random ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Btw. here are all our expeditions for anyone interested:<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/9916" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/9916</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/9920" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/9920</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/9940" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/9940</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/9962" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/9962</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/9989" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/9989</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10003" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10003</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10005" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10005</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10015" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10015</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10031" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10031</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10064" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10064</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10067" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10067</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10078" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10078</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10117" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10117</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10123" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10123</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10135" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10135</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10147" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10147</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10159" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10159</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10187" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10187</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10188" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10188</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10199" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10199</a></p>

You had multiple roles and probably wouldn't have been able to dedicate the AP like Paola would have. Either way, we wouldn't have been able to do it because a good chunk of Andie's AP came from Devotion Missions and coffee. Also you left us with little faith after refusing to shower (especially after you seemed so experienced prior which is another factor that lead us to being wary about keeping you around in case you were Mush). I have no doubt you would've made a good teammate if it weren't for that fatal error. You were high level and quite active. I'll admit we moved a bit quick but bad things can happen if you don't especially if your Mush is experienced. Really, fearing you should come as a compliment XD.</p>

                <p>Paola here, like the final words said, I was absolutely thrilled to be part of the ship and absolutely crushed to be mush on this one. Terry didn't do jack shit either, so I honestly did just give up and hope you guys would cure me. I am curious what gave away me being mush, I never extracted spores or anything. Figuring just rations not helping bases quickly enough. Anyways, don't blame you guys for offing me before I could rampage, but honestly I'm not that kind of player. I do wish there were times when you could just say look I can't do anything as mush and my partner is useless/whatever, I will cooperate with the ship. Glad you all had fun and I hope we can all do this again sometime, but without the fungus among us (specifically, inhabiting me)</p>

The main mush hunters were discussing you and actually didn't plan on killing you. Gioele didn't want to take the risk of what you'd do and sort of charged you on his own accord. There was a lot of awkward hesitation after we killed Eleesha. I was trying to push to have Terrence killed and the hesitation eventually lead to a pathetic rampage. I wouldn't have doubted that we probably could've moved on Terrence quietly enough and then saved you if you weren't killed so immediately. Terrence probably wouldn't have attacked if you had lived. I will say that Gioele did what he had to do and, while you shouldn't go killing people without the crew's blessing, he did have the evidence to do so. You may not have been planning to attack but other mush Paolas could have, sometimes you have to weigh the risk to the reward and need to settle for "good" instead of risking it for "best".</p>

                <p>Paola - Gioele here - I watched you go to the refectory, come back, and proceed to do absolutely nothing on comms. You really should have done it in the other order (go to the refectory, come back, then work on comms). Of course, given your relative inactivity prior, it would have been pretty tough to cover up that much AP usage but could have covered better on a "failed" progression on the base. since you would have had to use almost a full bar of AP. If other mush had already been identified / killed, I would not have objected to waiting for the cure. I guess my first real "proof" about Terrence was his rampage, but if others had real proof about his mushiness I may have missed that.</p>

How could we? He didn't do anything, ever. I was pushing because of that reason. He was active without activity. He just spoke about plans and then never really did anything. The hunters I spoke to were still uneasy about acting because of what happened to Eleesha. The way I saw it: if he ended up mush then yay, if he ended up human then it'd have been no loss anyways since he was being completely useless. I wasn't able to convince them, sadly, but it all still worked out!</p>
