                <p>End of Day 13, cycle 4: We returned to Sol right now.<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7780" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7780</a></p><p>Jin Su speaking <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/jinsu.png" alt=":mush_jin_su_50:" class="tid_ico">:</p><p>Actually I started the game as Hua, not my favorite character and first time playing it because I thought i would get on a certain ship posted in the forum, but it seems there were actually 2 ships who needed a Hua, well.<br>I had not always very much time so in the beginning I just killed hunters, slept and killed hunters again when I was logging in.</p><p>I noticed that our mush hunting did no good progress, so then I started to watch the crew more closely and messaged Chun about my suspicions ( I think my mush suspects were Ian, Gioele, Jin Su and Chao at that point).<br>Gioele was fully inactive, got killed and turned out as one mush , who was staying in unprotected room...<br>I got invited into the hunt channel and noticed that other people suspected Jin as well. Also there was an incident where slimetrapp was used and Jin was one of the suspects.<br>Furthermore a camera broke in my dorm where Jin was staying too and I noticed a spore after consulting mycoscan.</p><p>The case seemed to be fully clear at that point. But I wanted to convince the crew to research the cure, also because we didn't know whether there were beta mushes or not and Jin was a valuable crew member, right?.</p><p>So we worked on it, but a new player mentioned the progress in the research thread, not a good idea, because it makes mushes aware of the danger.<br>We invited him in our grown mush hunt channel therefore. Though it was too late at that point. If we would have invited just him, everything would have been turned out nice, but... at that point we didn't expect that there is another mush and someone invited Ian too to prevent another mistake like that... which turned out as a mistake too.</p><p>Not soon later Jin did try to kill Chun, failed, transferred into me- luckily I did spend almost all my aps previously <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> - and mutated. <br>Why he did that suddenly? Difficult to say, maybe because of stephen mentioning progress of the cure, maybe because someone warned him (and therfore someone who was invited recently),, maybe he just felt pressured already.</p><p>So we had a mutated Jin with low aps. Seems like an even better condition for finishing the cure. Unfortunately Chun (who had biologist because of mage book) did use up all her aps to punch back at Jin (who was staying with Ian ^^) after she realized thatv he almost killed her and had no aps anymore for research. And Jin stayed in Front corridor, so our other Biologist (Paola) wasn't able to move to laboratory.</p><p>...</p><p>Especially Frieda who suffered some room shakes and was trapped at bridge as well got very impatient and I think she or Paola did kill the mutated Jin then.</p><p>And that was almost our loss if Jin hadn't done a mistake....</p><p>Now that Jin was dead and I was online again I noticed the other channels besides the mush hunt channel and looked at them (ok, looking, refreshing, looking again) and now, some hours after the transfer already (fail, I could have looked earlier), I noticed that Jin did rather an epic fail <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.<br>We had brain sync because of Paola and therefore Jin hiding his itrackie before transferring was pretty useless... and so I saw Ian and Jin discussing about some plans.<br>Hahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Lucky day again I think.<br>And so we cured Ian soon afterwards.</p><p>With our fully human crew we did some expeditions afterwards, visitted 2 crystalite planets (always mush trap), but had to return to sol at day 13. We had too less people being active to heal suffering people, we had no fire detector and constantly new fires (that was very annoying and ap-intensive) and noone had aps to advance nexus to get fire detector soon. Though we had 2 shrinks (Chao read the shrink book and was therefore the psychoshrink) we weren't able to take care of morale very well-I think Chao went more or less inactive .<br>And so I returned us when Frieda was almost dead and noone helped her in time.</p><br><p>Thanks for the game, though we had some new players, the people were all rather active with only few exceptions.<br>I guess Terrence was a very experienced player, he has probably similar knowledge iof game as myself, I hope you show up.<br>Stephen, great game, you were a new but very active and reliable player, kudos to you!<br>Janice was cute and very helpful!<br>Chun too and you were right, you shoudl have invited everyone in mush hunt channel and noone else. <br>Paola and Frieda did their job very well. Also it was funny how Paola was shocked when she found out that she got pregnant from Ian while he was mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>I wonder whether she will give birth to a mush now...<br>Ian helped with plants very well, but was very quiet I think.<br>Roland helped very much too, but wasn't active enough in the end to tell about his bad health condition.<br>Chao was active in the beginning, his activity decreased after a while though. I would give you the advise to not save up many aps the next time when we know about a mush. You wanted to kill the mush if he decides to rampage, but it is probably better to just hold onto ap-booster and have not that many aps, so no mush is tempting to transfer into you for doing a rampage but at same time you would still be able to still kill a mush with boosters.<br>Jin, you tried well to get your team winning, that mistake was of course unfortunate, but you were also the one producing the most spores, so most risk was clearly on your side.<br>I think that were all active people.</p><br><p>edit: also I think I got a stomach transfer. Because once I drank coffee and ate 2 fruits with a poisoning chance of 90%..and didn't get ill. <br>I concluded that I had still the same strong stomach as when I was Hua. How that stomach transfer happened, I dunno.<br>Or Jin as just the same strong stomach as I had...</p>

I suspected her because of progressing Lenses before anti-mush researches, not picking tracker and saving like 4-8 AP several times instead of spending it (also I thought properties of food, medicines, etc disappear when someone unqualified updates AstroPad, luckily enough someone said otherwide on forums). I didn't except that Chun would take such drastical action and try to kill Eleesha right away.</p><p>I realised that it's almost guaranteed that Jin Su is a mush by day 5. I counted his AP and I knew he should have had 12 AP if he got bonus from cold blooded. When I asked him about his AP he answered he has only 10 AP.</p><p>Gioele was a mush but we weren't sure if alpha or beta (he was in CBT and if I recall correctly Chun didn't check logs every day) so we decided to finish RFS and use it on Jin Su. Ironically enough he decided to transfer into Hua even though she collected scrap like 1 or 2 cycles ago while he had Chao's body next to him with at least 8 AP and full MP.</p><p>After this action and D10 activity level of some people went downhill, we lost Roland and our situation started to be worse and worse, we had to come back, maybe if some players were more active we would be still be playing.</p><p>Anyway a fun game, I think it's my best game as human so far. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Eleesha wasn't mush, but she did more damage to the ship than all the Mush team combined. I announced her execution in public chat as a gamble designed to come out more positive than negative. I couldn't imagine her not being mush (she couldn't have looked more mushy if she tried but apparently she was just an evil player.) So... the idea was to either flush out her partner, or at the very least take away two of the mush's greatest weapons: stealth and initiative.</p><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_8729592 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8729592">WeakestLink</span> - :mush_terrence_50: I got so frustrated when you decided it was OK to invite people to Chun's Hunt channel.

At the time I was merely defending myself and didn't read the forums first (was trying not to die)<br>* I should have checked refectory more often in theory. I think in practice my AP were all tied up being the replacement Finola - but to be completely honest, even so I wouldn't have because I was too new a Chun to know better.<br>* Not working my second 'inner circle' mush hunt channel. Most of you didn't know that I had two channels running. Due to the lack of Tracker, or Torturer, this channel only had Roland in it. I should have been more aggressive maintaining it. This caused I think a lot of Terrence's frustration because he didn't know I had a separate 'web-of-trust'</p><p>Not really mistakes:<br>* Failure to check on Gioele - I just didn't have the AP to spare to waste on checking on him all the time.<br>*Announcing mush kills in public chat - This was a calculated risk<br>* Not inviting everyone that Terrence did or didn't suspect. I had my own list - I suspect Ian even way back when you thought he was human and merely made a 'mistake' hiding that hydropot.</p><p>10/10 would fail as Chun again</p>
