                <p>So the ship isn't strictly over yet, but I'm watching it from the death screen and the remainder of people on it seem to have accepted their death, so I think it's fine to create this now.</p><p>I was the original Terrence. I was really excited to play Terrence because of the free gold mode, and I quickly set about upgrading drones when the ship started. I was surprised that we never got a 16th. Seemed like we had 15 pretty early on day 4.</p><p>Anyways, selection happens and I'm mush. Thought about doing an early play like hiding the sample or immediately pulling spores, but I couldn't find a good excuse to be out and about, and my bed was in AD so I'd need a reason to be dirty. I chilled for a bit, and when I was back early anti-mush research was done.</p><p>From there, I discussed plans with Chao while slowly pulling spores with fertile. I was considering converting Raluca over day change, but I didn't have enough AP the first time as I'd used it all piloting. I was initially planning on quickly converting her around when she came on, waiting for both of us to be full, then PILGRED rushing while Chao killed or transferred into the commander. This never came about, and I sort of wanted to rampage when I saw the Lizaro and Rocket launcher blueprints.</p><p>We had three plans considered. First, was the Raluca-PILGRED rush plan. Second, was that we use starting spores and our high-level mush skills to convert multiple people, even under camera. Then we do what we can. Last was we rampage, killing all the techs while I dismantle the shower and build the rocket launcher. We ended up sort of mixing the two, as I used my two spores to immediately convert Janice under camera while we started working. I remembered that both dismantling and building a blueprint were 3 AP, so I used 9 simply building the rocket launcher, and when I tried to kill Raluca with it I whiffed and trapped myself in her turret. A quick punch finished her.</p><p>At that point, I was moving to kill Kuan just in case he took tech. Chao panicked and transferred into Ian; this turned out to be useful, as he moved away from Kuan, but I wasn't thrilled at the time. The rocket launcher actually worked for once, and I blew up Kuan in combination with a steel plate from heaven. After that, the plan was pretty much done, we were just going for extra. Paola had conveniently been inactive all game, so I transferred into her body for the AP and shooter. It wasn't the most effective. I'd been able to finish off two people with Terrence with maybe 5 AP. I wasted a bunch trying to punch Jin Su while he had the armor on. I retired to medlab to wait for my guns to recharge, but Finola declared a ceasefire, so I moved to BD. I wanted to kill Frieda, but she left, so I attacked Chao instead. Rocket Launcher missed again, but the natamy was able to injure him enough he died on cycle change. After that I waited for the ceasefire to end, as did the humans.</p><p>This was probably where I made my biggest mistake. I presumed you all wouldn't be online, and moved to attack Jin as it ended. I missed with the Natamy Rifle, which damaged my shoulder makign me less accurate. I then missed with the rocket launcher, which blew up the door to medlab, which had Ian. Jin was then able to almost kill me, and Frieda finished me off. This then dropped the Natamy, which made it mush easier to kill Ian. If I'd stayed with him, it would have been harder to kill me, which in turn makes it harder to kill Ian, which allows the ship to keep breaking down. It didn't matter that much in the end, but it still could have been better.</p><p>Anyways, the ship was nice. You all seemed fine. There were some bumps, but it was fun. Hope you all enjoyed the ship as well.</p>

                <p>Hello my dear friends. It's your favorite <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"> speaking!</p><p>As said before, the ship started well, loads of things were done before mush selection, but then Chun never woke up. We still managed to do a lot of researches, but not the ones we needed. Fortunately there wasn't a lot of mush activity, or so we thought.</p><p>Gioele being totally reckless, suspicious and overall just bad, we had to kill him first. There was not a lot of suspicion so I took it upon myself to eat twice under camera. I understand why it was not really appreciated, but given that we did not have Chun nor Eleesha, someone had to take this role; And honestly I did not live up to it. I'm not a very good mush hunter and I made the mistake of trusting Chao and overlooking the fact that he loved going to Bravo Dorm.</p><p>We ended up killing Eleesha because we thought she was mush, and that's when everything started to fall apart. I am very active so I saw Chao pick up the blueprint. I reported it to the whole ship, and mostly Jin Su, who had all of his energy, but by the time me managed to react, it was too late. Janice had been converted and the rampage started.</p><p>We thought Terrence was all out of energy so we figured he wasn't the biggest threat, and Chao already had to kill Hua so we thought he didn't have lots of energy either.<br>The next move was then to kill Janice, because she would have been really useful for the other camp.<br>And we did. It cost us a lot, but we did. In the meantime, Hua had died, and so did our dear Raluca.</p><p>Chao still tried to claim he was innocent. Nice try, but I'm not that naive. We were unlucky enough that Kuan Ti had been hurt by the Daedalus on cycle change, but Terrence having energy ? That was too much. He blew Kuan Ti to pieces and the gravity simulator with it. Honestly, I think that played in our favor.</p><p>Terrence became Paola and Chao became Ian.</p><p>I had never been so excited. I knew we had lost, but if the mush didn't survive, that was a win for me.<br>I managed to hide myself in Bravo dorm and sleep for a cycle. Being very active, I was there on cycle change and I saw Paola leave the room. I didn't think, I jumped for the door and waited a few minutes to go back in. In that time Paola had to focus on Chao. I'm sorry I had to sacrifice you Chao, but you could not benefit from the beds while I did and our actions points were all we had.</p><p>I went to bed thinking I might die, but still confident I wouldn't since I was still full life. And I woke up really energetic. Thanks to the actopi protocol, I saw Paola was in FS, so I rushed there and killed her. Thank god her body had been starving. We got the rocket launcher and the natamy rifle back.</p><p>Jin Su picked the Natamy and the lenses and went to town on Ian, who had mutated. No more pacifism. It was 3 against one, the dirty mush didn't stand a chance.</p><p>All the mush were dead, and 3 of us were still standing. (Braindead Terrence definitely was not standing). We had to figure out a way to survive. The plan was to find ourselves a pretty little planet and stay there. By then I had severe depression and no morale. I would have eaten the damn banana but I was full. Cycle change came, I lost 2 morale (no last hope) and killed myself.</p><br><br><p>All in all, I would like to thank everyone who was active (not GIOELE, you were a really bad human) and especially my last friends Jin Su, Finola and Chao/former Ian. It was a pleasure resisting with you.<br>And a big congrats to the mush, especially you Terrence. You really rocked the ship, I had tremendous fun fighting you.</p><p>I hope I'll see you in another life.</p><p>PS : Call me traumatized, but when I selected my new character, I directly went to Chun, no way I'm letting that happen again <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
