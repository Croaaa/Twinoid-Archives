                <p>First things first, the ship page: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/10753" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/10753</a></p><p>Next, the entire wall of the ship (minus any private conversations): <a href="http://spacekadt.com/mushscreens/crankypants.html" target="_blank">http://spacekadt.com/mushscreens/cran...</a> (like any good wall, it's in reverse order)</p><p>I would be the Frieda that got sucked in by a mush roleplay... twice. Not game mechanics, though. Let's make that clear. It was entirely roleplay. It's an important distinction as you'll learn if you keep reading.</p><p>And now, the story. We had a bunch of Toward Eden folks in IRC that were considering jumping into ships. We ended up with 5 of us in one ship... which is fun, but rarely turns out entirely well. The odds of us having one mush among us was something like 63%, the odds of two of us being mush were something like 12%. Depending on which team you play for, the RNG either loved or hated us.</p><p>But let's back up a little. First, we had Captain Crankypants (original JS) who started off by accusing me of holding a blaster because I had the audacity to pick it up from somewhere and bring it to the back of the ship. I had dropped it in BB, but that little bit of log was conveniently ignored so he could continue to yell insane things at me and various other crewmates.</p><p>Derek had been dirty since before mush selection and was asleep when the ship filled. He was in AD for that entire time and was asking about going to shower. Since I was clean and wanted to move to AD, I went to RC first so any spores would be logged, he switched dorms and I went to AD. Not to return to BD until much, much later. But somehow, that meant that we were both mush. Didn't matter how much we explained how game mechanics work, we were both mush working together and that proved it. Also, at some point, I apparently Did The Thing with Derek... I'm not sure what made him invent that, but it never did happen.</p><p>So anyway, Derek went on a bit of a rampage and the player behind it asked me in IRC if I knew what was going on. He said that Ian had thrown some grenades in lab and killed Stephen. This is where I become gullible the first time. I believed him. Because surely a TE person wouldn't lie OUT of game. But nope, totally lied. He admitted it quickly, but I had already called for Ian's death on ship. I quickly pointed out that I hadn't seen the logs with my own eyes and that someone else should verify (since I'd used all my AP fixing a damned door to get into lab) before doing anything. I'll let Derek tell his full story, but his rampage was rather effective morale-wise. Derek (one TE person) took out two other TE (KT and Stephen) among a bunch of morale deaths shortly after.</p><p>This left two of us. Me and Raluca. I had no idea Raluca was the other mush... she hadn't done anything remotely mushy (that I could tell) and wasn't even slightly on my radar. And continued that way for entirely too long. But we'll get there in a moment.</p><p>Since I got dirty fixing the door for lab, I finally went back to BD, showered and took a bed for a while. Then out of nowhere, Jin Su kills Raluca and I promptly flip my shit, screaming at him that he's fucking insane. This was my last TE comrade and how she's dead. And we've had another hit to everyone's morale. Most people are hovering around 1 or 2 morale at this point. I know I was down to 2 and I had spent one cycle with Janice early on. I checked logs to see what was going on and did notice that Raluca walked in, dropped a blaster, Jin Su immediately picked it up and killed Raluca. But now I'm being hit constantly and was down to 2hp and ran... and in the heat of the moment, the idea of a transfer didn't even dawn on me. Captain Crankypants was still the same old Crankypants I'd grown to know and hate.</p><p>Shortly after this, Terrence used NERON announcements to make a series of amusing posts about how to help people's morale. I'm not sure how half of the living crew continued to live, especially the idle Janice, but they did. And Hua finally got comms up and running and things were not so dire anymore.</p><p>The new Jin Su (Jinluca?) decided to RP the same kind of insanity that we'd been seeing from the original. He was getting more and more absurd, but to the rest of us, this wasn't at all out of line with what we'd seen before. I did notice one comment he made about being an "adamantium" player, which immediately made me go yell at someone in IRC (jokingly) that wasn't on ship because it was one hell of a coincidence that this unrelated person would use the same joke a day or so later. That alone should have raised my eyebrow more than it did, but this is gullible part 2. I fell for this aspect of RP. Then JS suddenly developed an actual personality that wasn't just yelling at people for random things. He was actually kinda funny. The he asked "how to steer ship Toward Eden" and I finally got it. I had no AP to deal with it, but got it.</p><p>Someone finally took him out and we were mush free. It took us a while to get PILGRED going (thanks to Paola not trading the inactive Janice when we had a chance and had asked her repeatedly), but we finally did and finally got back to Sol. It wasn't the best ship ever, but at least Jinluca made it amusing in the end instead of a miserable experience with Captain Crankypants.</p>

                <p>Oh geez. Wasn't on this ship but... Yeah looking at that wall - yeeeeesh.</p><p>Don't you just hate it when someone is a jerk and makes off base mush accusations, and it's a total coincidence that they're right? I mean, there's literally nothing suspicious in the act of forgetting to wash before selection, because it's <strong>before selection</strong>. It's what you do after that can make it suspicious or not and it looks like your Derek did everything he could to ensure that it was <em>not</em> suspicious - ie he gave himself no chance to spore, and made that public. But then Captain Crankypants was 'right,' because he was mush. Nevermind that it was due to coincidence rather than logic, and that could have just as easily been a human. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Mush Derek here!</p><p>I was so excited to be Derek. I was going to be a complete idiot the entire ship! Had some fun in the beginning and had to do surgery on my busted shoulder. I failed and got sepsis (and still didn't fix the shoulder). Had to heal myself then Ian saved me. But I had to wait a bit longer to fix myself again so I could use a turret to take down a few hunters as no pilots had awoken. I succeeded the second attempt and killed a hunter. Then I ran to do some mild inventory with my full MP and grabbed a camera to put in AD and laid down (I was dirty thanks to surgery).</p><p>It was already late and I didn't want to wash then put up the camera only to get dirty again so I took the bed and waited a cycle change so I'd have the AP to put up the camera. I was at 0 again and I would have to wait until 3AM my time in order to wash. I was willing to do so, though, and I started watching videos until I began to nod out. So I turned off my computer and went to bed, forgetting about the shower. I wake up (mush) and then have the huge argument with one of the worst players I've ever seen.</p><p>I told my partner I wouldn't take advantage of being dirty and pulling a spore before the argument had even begun because it's a dirty (hehe pun) tactic. So after that infuriating exchange with that troll, I was already tired of the ship. Given the amount of "TOTALLY LEGITIMATE SUSPICION" that I've accumulated, we agreed that we would need to act asap and began a two hour planning phase.</p><p>This ship... Was hard... A lot of skilled players and one player that was probably going to outright kill me based on false fantasy that his poor, inexperienced, jerkish mind made up. That means that slow conversion wasn't available. What about fast conversion? Yes... We started planning for that, a plan that would involve me being able to turn 2 techs single-handedly using day change, infector, and transfer. But then I realized my transfer target didn't have the AP to do it as he had piloted and didn't take a bed (It was Jin Su, would've loved to kill my old body, too). So we had to do something a little direct. We realized Chun hadn't handled inventory...</p><p>This means a rampage was a good shot, especially since I was Derek. I would have to kill AT LEAST 3 techs to properly whittle down the ship enough to destroy. That would make it so that Raluca would only have to deal with one other tech. So my plan was to eat a ridiculous amount of spores and do a ridiculous amount of damage. I ran to the lab with two grenades (Lab had apprentice Stephen and Tech Kuan Ti). I realized Ian was in there so I had to throw him out and I threw both grenades (Or two boulders if you asked Ian). Then I started hitting Stephen and only stopped at 1 AP... OH CRAP! I forgot to draw spores to phago! So I hit Stephen with my last AP and killed him (TOOK ME 3 HITS WITH WRESTLER I ROLLED TERRIBLE DAMAGE WITH TWO GRENADES).</p><p>So I sat there with 0 AP and both doors around me were broken. Kuan Ti was still alive. I attempted to trick Frieda into believe that Ian had done the damage and fled the room to FC in IRC. THen I started thinking and I didn't actually have my trackie so it was unfair for me to have tricked her. It only took me about 5 minutes through the whole ordeal to come clean to her (I didn't know she had put out a call to kill Ian as I didn't have a trackie). If I had a trackie I would've been fine with lying to her.</p><p>(Part 2 next post).</p>

                <p>So there I was... A living Kuan Ti and Chun next to me. Both would've easily been dead if I had drawn those spores... Kuan Ti apparently came online but couldn't do anything because his browser was messing up on his phone. He was almost dead (not like Stephen). Ian fixed the door and entered the room but... left to medlab and said he'd heal Kuan Ti next cycle. Raluca was talking to me on the side and told me she was being told to hit me. I told her to go ahead and hit me until she got the "protective clothing" message (Which made me have to take hard boiled instead of transfer... But only Ian and Jin Su had starting spores so transfer wouldn't have helped much). So Raluca strikes at me, missed, then hits me for 4 FREAKIN DAMAGE. Bare fisted... Against a hard boiled mush.. Busted my nose! I scream and run to FC to make it look like I was trying to avoid being murdered (though with damage like that, I did fear for my life. Hulkluca is not to be trifled with).</p><p>All I had to do was stall and hope for day change so I can start phagoing next day's spores and try to, at least, finish Kuan Ti. Roland comes in and shoots a gun at me. Misses two shots and hits me with one (dealt 1 damage, Raluca's fists are 4x stronger than a gunshot). He then runs off to kill hunters to protect the ship from damage. Nobody did anything to me and I had prepped to hurry in to kill Kuan Ti before Ian could heal him (I was being fed information by Raluca).</p><p>Day change happens. I immediately pull and eat a spore then run in and strike Kuan Ti once and drew another spore (I was not about to make the same mistake). Ian runs in before I hit him a second time and heals Kuan Ti once. I draw and phago another spore immediately and threw Ian back out. I hit Kuan Ti twice more and killed him. Drew what more spores I could then ran to AD in hopes that I might get a critical knife strike on Hua and kill her instantly. I did manage to give her a hemorrhage but it wasn't nearly enough... It didn't take long for Hua and Gioele to pummel me to death.</p><p>Now you're asking... Why not have Raluca join in on hte rampage? Well... I probably should've as I didn't expect the knife to be laying on the floor freely in the lab but we were worried that we would off all the techs and the crew would get a pilgred trade or a tech book from comms. Which is why I had Raluca stay quiet to follow the killing/converting later when she would only have to deal with 1 tech. Ideally my rampage would've killed 3 techs and Chun. I had wasted roughly 8 AP by failing to draw the spores at the start of my rampage. 8 AP for a wrestler Derek is a kill and a half. Such a shame.</p><p>After my death, Jin Su came on, diarrhea-ing his bullshit once again. Falsely patting himself on the back over things he was blatantly wrong about (yes, wrong. He didn't know I was mush. He just happened to spout paranoid bullshit and coincidentally was right). Raluca came on and messaged me saying that she was tired of him and that he needed to be punished. I agreed and told him he could do whatever he wanted. That's when the hilarity ensued and this crap ship turned into one that was worth everything.
