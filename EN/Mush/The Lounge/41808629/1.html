                <p>This is the AP thread for <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5727">This Ship.</a></p><p>Hi I was Raluca and it was a really fun ship thanks largely to our very clever Mush, Frieda/Terrence (FT Mush) and Kuan Mush. Frieda sent us to a Fail planet when we badly needed oxygen, so Gioele killed her. But apparently she had Transferred to Terrence and we missed that point and thought she was just a griefer. I saw your final message about the sdf report, but just be glad that your plan worked well enough that we missed your move because it set you up to really put the screws in.</p><p>The human crew managed to get lucky and find another O2 planet. That's when the Mush really made a <em>great</em> power play that almost killed us. We were down to just one o2 and ready to jump. Kuan Mush went and siphoned off the o2 from our tank while F/T Mush went and loaded 9 fuel in the engine when the oxy planet was just 3 fuel away. That should have destroyed the humans and it nearly did.</p><p>Luckily I woke up irl and looked in on the ship before I'd even had my coffee. I saw there was zero oxygen where there had been 4 or 5 when I went to sleep. OMG, my first thought was there was an oxy tank broken and as a tech I went to look for it. There was no Neron warning, so it must have been a mush who broke it. I found that Kuan had been in CBS for no reason and noticed Terrence was dirty in BB. I called a kill on Kuan, but didn't know for sure about Terrence yet. I just knew we needed to kill Kuan to get the o2 back and we needed to get to our planet for more.</p><p>So I went to load the 3 fuel we needed since no one had posted it was loaded. When I got to the Engine room I saw that Terrence had loaded 9 Fuel and called a kill on him too. I unloaded 6 fuel and just as I was loading the last of it back in the tank I saw we had jumped. I had gotten it out with maybe a minute or two to spare. FT Mush, this was I think your only mistake in a near perfect game. If you had posted saying you'd loaded 3 fuel, I wouldn't have gone to the engine room, discovered your ploy and unloaded the fuel. Just as deadly Gioele might have jumped us sooner and we'd have been toast. But really nice play.</p><p>I had the knife, almost full AP and a thermos of coffee and an energy bar available from the vending machine. I went and killed Terrence first since I knew where he was. Then I nearly blew it. I saw a death notice for Roland and also that Andie was on the move. I was in a blood frenzy at that point and not thinking as clearly as I should be and posted that Andie was a third mush to kill. I went to IB and saw s/he was there. I cut her/m once with the knife, and luckily my brain kicked back in for some reason. I don't even know why, but suddenly it clicked that Roland might have been doing the dumb pilot trick of idling outside the ship when Gioele moved us. I cut off the attack and went to look for Kuan Mush in AD. He was there and when I and Eleesha finished him off together. He dropped 1 can of o2, a lifesaver.</p><p>I grabbed the o2 cannister and installed it with about 4 minutes left in the cycle. We arrived safely at the planet and managed to pump 8 units of o2 up to the ship. Sadly poor Janice died of asphyxiation even though we had o2, that was a real disappointment. With a final rush of team effort we got Pilgred from 16% to online status and made our way back to sol with about 5 or 6 humans still alive to tell the story.</p><p>Again, I was very impressed with the Mush play. That was one of the best timed and sneakiest plots I've ever seen. I'm even more impressed now that I know about the Frieda/Terrence Transfer. Kudos.</p><p>One final note to Jin Su who was upset that he was killed and reported as a possible griefer. You said yourself in your final message that you were not posting your activity. Posting activity takes little time and no :pa: or :pm:. On the other hand, tracing your activities on the ship takes lots of time and points. If you can't be bothered to do something so simple, don't expect that anyone is going to spend the effort and points to run around the ship trying to prove that you're innocent. I hope that in the future that you take responsibility for yourself or else you shouldn't be surprised when people draw conclusions and act on them when things get tense. This is a rough game for people who can't communicate well, being largely text and all. Sorry that you were unhappy with how things turned out though, better luck in the future.</p><p>FT Mush, different issue. Your mush play was great and it fooled us. But you were playing a ship with a lot of inactives with :pa: at a premium. Gioele tracked and killed you as Frieda and at that point it really looked like Frieda was a griefing human. It never hurts to report someone and let the SDF decide when it looks that way. They have full access to the logs and can make an informed decision that we as players can't. In your case I'm sure they cleared you quickly and I hope they complimented you on making us look like a bunch of saps as well.</p><p>Hope to see some of you posting here. I really enjoyed all of you and thought this was one of the most fun ships I've been on lately. I hope most of the rest of you feel the same.</p>
