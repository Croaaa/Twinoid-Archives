So I have nobody I can trust. Only Andie. And a little Frieda. But Andie didn't trust me and was busy with comms all the time, Frieda was not proven so I could only do detective job by myself as I should. <br>Terry was alpha and he acted too obvious. He didn't try to feed me a good excuse why did he visit Icarus when I was standing. So I warned Frieda I am going to kill him, she told we have a reason to suspect him so I killed Terry. One mush killed. It's awesome feeling when your victim is mush not human. I hate mistakes.<br>Second mush didn't show itself, so we collected persons who are 100% human. I had good feeling about our mission. Yep, we have a problem with oxygen and hunters but we had a good chance to survive and find second mush.<br>If only Adnie could come a little earlier everything could go another way. But at the time Andie was able to sell inactive for oxygen we had a lot of hunters outside. Crew expended all their energies on clearing sky and that was the time Gio, second alpha, made his strike.<br>It was nice timing and nice target. If only Gio could use anonymush skill nobody would suspect him. But he couldn't. I saw 3d mush on crewbar so it was not hard to find out who is our alpha. So I killed Gio. But I was not sure about beta. Janice spent all the time in RC was very good target but how could I be sure Gio managed to spike her 3 times already? She didn't spent a lot of time in unsecured rooms and we had 2 inactives. And Roland who just walked around the ship and didn't communicate.<br>Janice made mistake. She took anonymush after I told about 3d mush. So now I knew our beta is active. I told about everything and went sleep. I was not sure we will be ready to survive - 0 oxygen, hull less than 40%, one mush, a lot of inactives.<br>And it was surprise when I came back and saw I am still alive. Jin Su managed to move ship and found oxygen planet for us but didn't survive. Andie found some oxygen in capsules (right?). Frieda finished Janice who was beta. And almost everyone was dead from lack of oxygen or morale.<br>So there was only 4 of us (and inactive Paola) left in the ship orbiting planet. <br>At this moment I was in desperate situation. Start was good but this was the end. The bad end.<br>Andie and Frieda got some oxygen from planet but situation was not good at all. Our only chanse - Raluca didn't respond and I started suspect she was converted too. It was less possible but well, I had no any other version why did she remained silent and do nothing.<br>And at the very last moment she returned and we repaired PILGRED!<img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"><br>So many different emotions in one run. And the best part for me as security officer - I didn't kill or harm any human. All my victims were mushes. It happens not too often.</p>

But so very fun!</p><p>Early on, I had formed a group chat with Kuan, and Andie. A mush-hunt chat. We were keeping our eyes on things, but didn't manage to do much. Derek, as paranoid as he was (and you did go a little overboard at times <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">) did manage to find the Mush, even without the death of a single human...</p><p>It all kicked off those last few cycles, didn't it? Our oxygen planet ran out of oxygen. I started attempting to lead the final push to survival, but in the end it was touch and go. I wanted to leave killing Janice to later - and we may have saved one or two people by doing it. Alas, I got impatient, and killed her 10 minutes before Jin logged in.</p><p>Jin and I developed a plan; I would fill the engines with fuel, and he'd leave orbit. I then told him to drop everything and scan for planets until he got an O2 zone, stopping at that point, even if there were unknowns. This left us with a nice planet 5 North. We were to go there the next cycle, grab the O2 needed etc. Andie was also talking about opening O2 capsules...</p><p>Alas, come cycle change, the worst. Possible. Thing. happened to us. Chun died to asphyxiation, on DAY CHANGE! Suddenly, 3 lost morale for EVERYONE. Half the crew committed suicide, leaving us with little hope. Andie did manage to find 3O2 in a capsule, which (s)he lamented that it could have saved everyone, had it been opened earlier.</p><p>Jin had died, leaving me as the one with the title of commander. On the other end of the ship. Andie, luckily, did come and give me a ration, allowing me to quickly run to the bridge and bring us to the planet. I then went to bed IRL, loitering in the Icarus Bay on... 6 HP I believe, as a pilot, telling anyone who came online to go to the planet with me.</p><p>It was a success! We got 22 O2, and returned to the ship in triumph! Raluca soon came online, and finished PILGRED, securing the win with little hull left!</p><p>Derek suspected Raluca at this point due to 2 Mush passing her room (with one passing him in a non-camera-ed room beforehand), but I proved her human with a little social manipulation (pretending the Mycoscan was 99%, see if she'd come to help). I always knew she was human.</p><p>Finally, we went home in style, though without the retro-fungal Serum. With only a ghosted Chun, and a devastated crew, how will the heroes of the Daedalus save the day? Well... That is another story.</p>
