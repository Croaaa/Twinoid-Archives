                <p>Hello, your favorite security officer is talking!<br>(I really need to learn how to play against humans when Chun say such a nice things to me!)<br>Ship is here: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7970" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7970</a></p><p>Everything went well at the beginning... I figured out that I want to play a character I rarely use and I noticed Chao is out there, just waiting to be picked. <br>Why not, it will be fun! Especially that I had access to skill up to level five.</p><p>But then Mush showed up and... oh hey, I am a Mush. At least I don't have to worry about torturer. My Mush Friend was Kuan Ti - who was caught rather fast by Chun who noticed that she lost two morale... demoralize skill in action and after a cycle one Mush is dead.</p><p>The next few days were rather boring. Mush Chao tried to stay low, because what else he can do when all those researches are finished. Spores are costly, four are needed to convert a human, even pheromodem was up. Fortunately there were a few people who looked much more suspicious than a security officer who tortured people from time to time. <br>Around day 7 I decided that it's too boring. I don't really like to not doing anything for a long period of time, so... I decided to play openly. Who doesn't like mind games after all? <br>I noticed that weapons are unprotected at IB, armor just waiting in the Lab where Ian also was standing. Perfect oportunity. Day change is close so it's time to act. Two spores pushed into mouth of Hua, another two pushed into her after the day change. Pop - one more mush in the dorm. They can figure out who I converted, but still it's 1/3 chances they guess right. After that I grabbed weapons, armor, took hardboiled and crazy eyes, wrote a nice message about the rules of a new game: find, kill all the mushes and you probably win. Otherwise we gonna win... and I was just sitting in the lab eating popcorn.</p><p>Seriously... I was just standing there for more than a day. Humans were killing each other one by one. <br>Terrence started attacking Paola - she killed him after that. <br>Finola was actually right about the whole plan - but she was killed by Janice for some reasons <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Paola killed Frieda... which left only Hua from those I could converted, so she was dead after a cycle or two. <br>In the meantime Gioele burned, Roland starved to death, Eleesha hang herself.</p><p>At least Stephen showed up, kicked Ian out of the Lab and they were able to kill me... Probably I would do much more harm, but Paola was really lucky when she shoot me once before she went after Frieda. Because of that shoot I got an injury which made all actions cost two more AP.</p><p>So I thought at this point you deserved to win, but... for some reasons you didn't. I know I left you with really low armor and without pilots, but still... you had big chances to finish Pilgred. Why you weren't going to Sol?<br>There were some nice players so I would like to hear your side of the story. <br>I loved the way Stephen was playing. But I guess pirate vessel wasn't too organized <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
