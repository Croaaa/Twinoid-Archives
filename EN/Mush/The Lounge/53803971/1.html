                <p>Well, this ship here has been, by far, my <strong>BEST SHIP EVER</strong>!<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9473" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9473</a></p><br><p>Our story begins with me picking sweet little <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/finola.png" alt=":mush_finola_50:" class="tid_ico"> <em>Finola</em> for the very first time ever. I saw her in my selection and I didn't hesitate one bit. I was the third person to wake up, the first being Ian and the second Terrence. Of course, I did what every responsible crew member would do. I moved some things around then spent two full AP bars emptying about four turrets into the hunters outside. First, I went for the Medkit, Armor, Knife, Grenade and Hacker Kit and I conveniently placed them in the Medlab with the mental note of letting Chun know where she could find them for picking up upon Mush select.</p><p>Cycles went by and people started showing up. Terrence got quarantined shortly after he joined so we were already short a pair of hands.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I tested Fino's research powers on pretty much researching the Narcotics Distiller all by myself. I had also made a point to the crew that I would be claiming the Medlab as my base of operations and anyone passing through post-Mush select (except for Chun) would be deemed Mush. Fast forward to around Day 2 Cycle 6 (or 7) and the two lovely Mush were selected. Of course, I was human and decided I shall make good use of my totally broken research power and we basically blitzed through the ASG and CS. Before that, however, I PMed Chun letting her know where all the items she would need to take care of were and, since she was pretty quiet, I took the liberty of holding on to the Knife and Armor whilst I conveniently hid the Grenade and Hacker Kit in the Medlab (and nobody noticed <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">). I then spent every single day reminding Chun about the location of the items and nearly begging her to take the Knife and Armor off my hands. Eventually, about a cycle before she died (RIP <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico">) she told me in our confirmed humans chat to keep them since I was more active (but that's a story for later on <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>From the moment the Mushes were selected and up until somewhere between Day 5 and Day 6, I have spent every bit of AP on Research and, at some point, all we had left to research that did not require a dead Mush were the Super Soaper and the bits of research that required the Water Stick (but I totally forgot about the Super Soaper <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico">). Between that time and the moment the Mushes acted, Paola, Jin Su, Ian, Roland and myself got confirmed human either via illnesses or by double eating (in my case in order to complete research, in Paola's case in order to carry on with her incredibly amazing comms work [I swear, that was <strong>the best</strong> Paola I've ever seen on any ship I've played so far]).</p><p>The cute little humans chat was quite fun. Roland and I started a sort of... fling I suppose <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"> and, since Chun was incredibly quiet and pretty much inactive half the time (she had no messages in public chat at all and she hardly relayed research, but she <em>DID</em> move around, investigating and expressing her concerns in our exclusive little club), I ended up taking charge of the Mush hunt. I still don't know why or how, but, soon enough, I was getting PMs from a lot of people on board where they would express their own concerns and we would discuss everyone's findings. I was pretty much a Chun stand in without even trying to be. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/oups.gif" alt=":anim_oups:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In our little chat, we all suspected Janice because, even though she DID seem pretty new and was asking lots of questions, she was suspicious. <strong>TOO suspicious</strong>. She tried to play the human part some, but we managed to see through her. We started talking, making plans to find her partner and kill them and research the serum then quietly convert Jan. Our goal (or should I say <strong>my</strong> goal, really) was to try for Eden. For that, we needed a reliable and constant <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico">Morale source. But her partner was playing the waiting game. We had pretty much blocked the Mush and made it quite difficult for them to spread their spores around since our research was flowing smoothly so, unless they were really cunning or high level, it would have been quite difficult to pull off any conversions. We even killed Stephen with the Natamy around Day 4 or whenever, because he was highly inactive, there were no good trades in sight and we wanted to avoid a transfer into a Solid, full AP and full MP Stephen. After the first Natamy shot, we knew he was human but it was too late to back down. The Mush now knew we were actively looking for them.</p><p><strong>End of Part 1</strong></p>

                <p>Here is Part 2 of the story <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I had my own suspicions on whom the Mush were. I mean, we all suspected Janice, but there was still the possibility, albeit tiny, that she was a beta. My prime suspects were <em>Eleesha</em> and <em>Chao</em>. Eleesha and Chao had started a PM, talking about collecting logs and whatnot and added me to it since I was proven human. There was one slight issue though: they weren't.</p><p><strong><em>Chao</em></strong> had been quite helpful, removing an ill-placed Medlab camera for me and then bringing a Mycoalarm as soon as they were completed but I saw that as reasons for him to enter the Medlab and nothing would have stopped him from sporing me either after removing the camera or before dropping the Mycoalarm. Call me paranoid, but hey, I had to be cautious. I stopped suspecting him once we had the Mycoscan and my scans always showed a pre-fungal level of 0. Chao and I then kept in touch via PM. He was also using a lot of his AP on Research, he was patrolling the ship and he and I were in talks over torturing one of our suspects.</p><p><strong><em>Eleesha</em></strong> on the other hand left me forever suspicious, from the very moment she invited me to that private message and all the way to her "absence" and "return". She kept going on about logs and whatever but she was presenting no hard proof. She was bluffing and it was obvious. At least that's what it looked like to me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico">. She went missing for about a day, saying she'd be busy. Upon her return, I messaged her asking about her findings and she said she'll look around and let me know. As I mentioned, no one was discussing with Chun, all the Mush related talks were always between me and various members of the crew which would then be shared with our confirmed humans. We also developed a habit of scanning ourselves before/after expeditions and whatnot (we had a couple of Mush Trap events on expeditions). But anyways, back to our ace detective Eleesha. We were on Day 5 I think when she came back so I finally mentioned the infamous LIST. She had been pretty talkative up until I uttered those two little words. She stopped talking then and now I was over 80% suspicious of her. I said nothing, however and just went to bed. When I woke up sometime early Day 6, Chun was dead and so was Eleesha. She had seized her chance, printed the list (she was on it along with myself and two other proven people) and then defaced the Lab and murdered Chun. Roland caught on and immediately disposed of Eleesha. What Leesh didn't realize, however, was that by going for Chun over Janice, she pretty much threw Jan under the bus as well because no rampaging Mush leaves Janice alive unless the latter is also Mush. I was happy Leesh died because <strong>YAY! MORE RESEARCH!</strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>After Eleesha died, Janice became increasingly more talkative, fidgety and active. She kept making "newbie mistakes" and giving herself away more and more. People had started openly suspecting her and pointing fingers and she kept playing victim over it. I had finally made up my mind and insisted Chao tortured her whilst I relayed RFS to about 39%. Should Chao's torture reveal Mushy deeds, my plan was to have the other provens help me blitz research RFS and we would have cured her. Unfortunately, neither one of them was online, but Janice was and she immediately called Chao out in chat for "trying to kill her", still insisting she was human, desperately holding on to the last thread of hope. I had even told her in PM a day earlier that she was being suspicious and "let slip" the fact that Janice mushes often get cured rather than killed. It was good bait which she just about took. Of course, Chao's logs revealed that Janice had been the cause of about seven simultaneous breakages, all around the rear of the ship. Since she was calling Chao out and definitely knew she was found out, I immediately acted. I made the torture logs public and kept putting pressure on her. She had to die and she had to go before she either killed me or another crucial member of the crew. My usual lack of AP, however, made my attempt futile as she ran off and I was stranded in BD. Jan then ran to the Medlab, picked up the armor I had dropped in favour of the apron (can't go about getting Fino dirty with Mushy blood, could I? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">. She then ran on the Bridge and mutated, probably not knowing or forgetting that one drops all their items upon mutating. She then tried killing Jin Su and I used my very last MP and AP in a mad dash for the bridge where I used my free healing point to save Jin from his impeding demise. The next half a cycle or so was tense. There were 6 of us on the Bridge, all deprived of AP. Luckily, Jan had kicked Paola off the sofa so I took it and, at cycle change, the ship decided to give me a hand by steel plating us. That dealt enough damage to Janice that one thrust of the knife was all I needed to end her Mushy life. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"> We were now Mush free.</p><p>As soon as the Mush died, for whatever odd reason, I became the de facto leader of the crew <img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico">. So I devised an extensive plan on trying to reach Eden. It had four points to it and each point covered every issue that would keep us from an Eden win. I even went as far as assigning teams to the various points and the only thing people didn't agree with me on was where to build the second Sofa (silly thing was never built in the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico">). Otherwise, people were happy to follow the plan and so team PILGRED (Raluca and Kuan Ti with ocasional relays from Chao) rushed the reactor, Team Research (myself, Ian and Paola as soon as she was done with the comms work ~we had a Medic magebook~) was to finish the serum and do other bits and pieces of research, Team Hunters (Roland and Hua) were on killing hunters and scrap collecting duty as well as Hull repairs should we have clear surroundings and their AP would end up wasted otherwise) and Team Astro (Frieda and Gioele) were to scan for planets that would bring us the coveted star map fragments. Things went alright for a little while. Paola, as I said, had been a real beast when it came to her comms work (the only base we missed was Centauri I think because we didn't need the extra blaster power) and she took dear NERON all the way up to level 6 before finally reading the Medic agebook and joining me on heal duty.</p><p>Towards Day 8, however, as soon as PILGRED was finished, activity levels dropped. Raluca and Kuan Ti were barely logging in at all, Hua was on once a day only, Jin was busy most of the cycles so we couldn't keep up the crew Morale even with the two Leaders and the 6(or 7) bananas and we took an asteroid hit.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Moving around became slower as well and it took nearly 2 days to finally launch an extensive expedition that granted us our first (and only) star map piece. By Day 10, I had taken Diplomat and our goal, up until we got the map piece, was to hold out as much as possible and simply return to Sol. After I took Diplomat and we finally had the long overdue expedition and got our first map piece, Frieda immediately found us what looked like a gem of a planet with more than enough chances at map pieces. <br><cite><br>Frieda : Planets D10C6:<br>Datedon (14 cases)<br>North - 4 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fuel.png" alt=":mush_fuel:" class="tid_ico"><br>Desert, Predators, Cristalite, Forest, Oxygen, Forest, Oceanic, Intelligent Life, Insects, Forest, Intelligent Life, Shipwreck, Oceanic, Ruminants. Fully scanned. </cite></p><p>So of course, we went for it and we had our hopes up high and we were planning on how to rush the Super Calculator and we could already see ourselves on Eden. But then we had too many MIA events, two Invertebrate Shells, some fuel and a Mush trap. Found Chao on our second run on the planet but then Roland went missing and when we found him, the poor soul was dead. Fino weeped for the loss of the man that had kept her company through so many cold nights in the immaculate Medlab <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We were absolutely floored. With three people barely active and with people having trouble with Morale and then, adding the death of our main Pilot (he was far more active than Hua) to the already large enough list of losses, we decided that RNGesus didn't deem us worthy of Eden so we made for a Sol return with the Serum.</p><p><strong>THE END.</strong></p>

                <p>And to end what I wanted to say about this amazingly awesome ship, here's a few words on the crew members that most inspired me on this voyage.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/roland_zuccali.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RZ:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><em>Roland</em></strong> what we had started as a bit of fun to keep our spirits high, but, by the end of the journey, I must say, I came to care for you and was devastated by your loss. I could already see us on Eden, a happy family with possibly a little Roland Jr or a little Finola running around. But it seems it wasn't meant to be. You shall be missed. In all seriousness though, you were really fun to play with. You took the initiative on most of the Expeditions, you did lots of everything around the ship and there wasn't a moment when you were online that you weren't busy with something, be it hunters, fooling around with me in the Medlab or jumping on yet another expedition. I'm really looking forward to seeing you on our casting ship soon <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/wang_chao.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_WC:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><em>Chao</em></strong> at first, you really annoyed the life out of me because I really thought you were Mush. You were contesting most everything I said in PMs yet in the main chat, you openly defended my point of view. You helped me a whole lot with the Mush hunt <strong>AND</strong> more. And hey, even though you did sort of freak out when I made your torture logs public and I got told off by you big time for it, by that time I already trusted you because I had taken my time to observe you and even went as far to do some mild AP counting that was exclusive to you. I knew for a fact that there was no way you could be Mush. Eleesha was already dead and Janice made herself suspicious time and time again and everyone already knew deep down that she was Mush. There was just no way, not with your AP handicap, that you would have been able to go around spreading Mushiness when we had so many Anti-Mush measures. I mean, ok, maybe there was a slight chance, but I brushed it off and I was right <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/ian_soulton.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_IS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><em>Ian</em></strong> you were so diligent in both your gardening work <strong>AND</strong> research and you also hopped on quite some expeditions. You were lost.... and found and you were really fun to play with. Plus, you left researches for me to finish for the extra glory so thanks for that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/kim_jin_su.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_KJS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><em>Jin</em></strong> I must admit, I was<strong> SO</strong> frustrated with you not being able to be online at least once a cycle every cycle but I channeled my frustration elsewhere for the most part because ultimately, when you were around, you were more than useful and helpful. And you still owe me clean sheets for sleeping in my bed <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/gioele_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_GR:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><em>Gioele</em></strong> You were really fun to have around. You were so crazy about your coffe that I thought you were gonna grab that Lizaro or maybe the knife and put an end to Paola's life since she kept taking all the early coffees before PILGRED was up. You also joined expeditions and relayed projects and research and I think even PILGRED. <strong>AND</strong> you became a Chef so you had your hands full and I'm amazed how you managed to stay on top of it all.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/paola_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_PR:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><em>Paola</em></strong> you were <strong>AMAZING</strong>! You were so dedicated to your comms work that I'm surprised you didn't get sick or fat or both from all the coffee and bananas and food and whatever else you had to eat to keep on top of all of that work. You were mostly quiet and kept to yourself but I knew and noticed that you were reading the chat and knew what was going on. Even after you finished the comms work, you took over healing where I couldn't and relayed research and you were forever useful. Thank you for your hard work.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/frieda_bergmann.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FB:" class="tid_ico"> <strong> <em>Frieda</em></strong> You provided us with lots of good planets granny. Thank you for everything you did for us. It's been a pleasure cruising around the infinite space with you.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/raluca_tomescu.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RT:" class="tid_ico"> &amp; <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/lai_kuan_ti.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_LKT:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><em>Raluca</em></strong> and <strong><em>Kuan Ti</em></strong>, you guys were incredibly fast at getting PILGRED up and running and were so much in sync that I swear, it was like you were joint at the hip. We couldn't have completed our journey if it wasn't for your efforts.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/zhong_chun.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_ZC:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><em>Chun</em></strong> I'm sorry we lost you so soon. I kinda wish I'd seen you around more, but I really regret not being online to try and save you.</p><p>Everyone else was great as well but I just didn't see enough of you guys D:</p>

                <p>Well yo~~~~~ Its before i leave for college so i write fast! <br>Roland here <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Its been a while since i posted you know but heeey be kind on me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> <br>So i am sure everyone have this kind of times when they say "Man i won't choose a character anymore, real life is a little too busy " and stuff but when you see the selection you go for it, this is how i choose Roland on that ship!</p><p>I was at gym, training with punching bag and other stuff for few hours that there in my break time checked web and mush to see this selection, i wasn't actually thinking about taking Roland cause heck i played him alot <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> But my hand slipped and touched play ((&gt;_&gt; What?)) So i woke up and gone out doing stuff like killing hunters i guess ((not a good memory xD)) And just went silent.</p><p>After a day i believe i was sitting and staring at the screen, being unsure about this thing from start after seeing how active this crew turned out to be, as i was rubbing my awesome chin i said "whatever" And wrote tons of stuff in there. The truth is, i learned whenever you start to be active, you never can go back, so i went ahead and wrote like 8 post with more than three paragraph RPing and stuff, and got more into game.</p><p>Killed all hunters at first part of game, collected scraps, since Hua wasn't that pro in piloting which she proved against that in late game. And mush select happened, i checked forum to see Orianna same as always asking obvious questions about my ship, which made me be sure that i am with her on the ship, PMed her and from there i became even more active xD</p><p>So honestly nothing serious happened, my suspects from very first start of bat was Chao, when mush selection happened he visited BD and dropped a BP there((which was useless BP)) And left, that wasn't something pleasant, so i kept my eye on him then on Janice. She just was on bed next to me in BD all the time, not moving to AD at all, never talking and stuff but i wanted to cure her so i kept it quite. At one point i "Misclicked" And entered medlab and flirted with Finola <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ~.~ Come on Roland was drunk with his whiskey, and love story begun, i guess at that point i became a proven human.</p><p>Anyway i became less active in D4 and D5 honestly since it was my college days in week, which is 13 hours long, not to mentoin i had to work in hospital too, i had nearly no time to check in. So i can't say much about Eleesha, never bothered about her. But found Chun really suspective about her in PMs.</p><p>D6? It was when i woke up from my sweet bed, brushing my teeth, which i got to look at laptob finding chun left the world! <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_surprise.gif" alt=":O" class="tid_ico"> Thought at first i was like "*Yawn* ((Yea Yawn was most part of this word of wisdom)) Whatever)) And just clicked on the main channel. Scrolled down to see no event of her death! It was 20 min before that so i took this as an alarm for mush rampage. Quickly i gone to kitchen ate, and followed Chun trace to get into FC. She left the room and after her eleesha gone inside, gone to lab to see defactor back to medlab to see fino never left for 3 cycles, ((I would kill her if she did earlier <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico">)) and took natamy from there gone inside and killed Eleesha. Thought she was lucky and just one shoot from natamy hit her, but still my hands were powerful!</p><br><p>So i killed her ((All the time with brush in my mouth)) And gone to bed, and there was i declared in PMs that Janice is last mush. So then i come back again seeing Janice dead and our journey for finding eden started.</p><p>Honestly this ship could be such a great one if just Kuan atleast been more active but oh man i understand rl shit <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Also Finola you weren't only person which tried for eden, heck look at my ships i have alot of ships now and never made to one, cause activity drops like what you see. For eden you would need a commander like <span class="tid_user tid_user_516 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="516">Peanutz</span> or something <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> So you weren't only one aiming for eden xD</p><p>Anyway it was a pleasant ship indeed, thought i died in the end :/ Good job mush too, honestly i know pain of having an active crew especially in research part! I would give a thumbs up to Janice since it was her first mush game i believe, and to Eleesha hmmm yeaaa good job too, but i just felt she could do more, but now reading Fino side i came to releazie she was forced to rush.</p><p>Anyway thanks all for this ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I admit that I don't have much experience playing Jin Su (my second game actually) so it was pretty difficult, especially since I had to work extra time at school since I'm graduating at the end of the year so I haven't been as "aware" as I could have been =p Sorry about that, I really wanted to be here 24/7 but studies first <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"><br>But a good game, all in all. It would have been too easy and boring if the Mush weren't here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
