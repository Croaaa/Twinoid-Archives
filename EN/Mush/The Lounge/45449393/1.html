                <p>The end = <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7201" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7201</a></p><p>Sorry for the late AP. I know some of you wanted to know how you got mushed and the amount of silliness that went on, on this ship.</p><p>Hopefully you guys see this thread, I will be posting the juicy very short in time. I'm not too good with formatting but I can explain everything. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Noteable events</strong><br>Note: this is from mush perspective I was <em>Eleesha</em> these events happened through days so hopefully others can fill in gaps.</p><p>1. Tortured to death: After mush selection Terrence must have been dirty from dismantling the shower and went to clean himself up. Chao spotted this and walloped Terrence 3 times and tortured him. Death registered, Terrence. Cause: Injuries. Chao repented for his mistake, he didn't realize he punched trains. Everyone was rather upset considering he was our only active tech.</p><p>2. Front bravo turret: Raluca had been standing in the lab as soon as she woke up. Terrified, Raluca stood strong and endured with maybe 1 or 2 hugs from Janice. Chao and Gioele began pushing inactives around including Jin su who was pushed into front bravo turret along with Raluca and Kuan who was shooting at hunters.</p><p>3. The goof up: <em>Finola</em> manages to extract 2 spores and double spikes Jin su standing with Kuan and Raluca. <em>Finola</em> trying to relay information to me accidentally says it in the human channel that she was in. Immediately I spored, showered (with splashproof) spiked Jin su. I don't know how Finola persuaded the humans but we were safe.</p><p>4. A soul crushed Chao, a convincing <em>Finola</em>: manages to somehow pin the blame on inactive Jin su. He hadn't moved at all from the start of the game. Chao looking to redeem himself kills Jin su who was mush and became the true ruler of the deadalus. Only one mush on board the human crew thought. Finola was safe and I was undercover. <em>Raluca</em> also shortly died after. Cause: Starvation. Kuan was still on those hunters.</p><p>5. The waiting game: With Chao impregnating women where he walked he also beat the crap outta me and tortured me. Luckly I had buffered actions so he didn't see anything. I had been being quite and pinging research and light conversation.<br> <br>During this time Finola has been getting in deep with the humans and even faked confirming she was human. Chao was keeping an eye on the crew really well. Lots of activity from gioele and hua. Paola had a keen eye too.</p><p>I had to stay away from bravo dorm and play it safe. Chao was having a real hard time finding mush. <em>Frieda</em> finds an o2 and cristilite planet. Which worked in our favor. Finola double infects hua and gioele ate a spore from the mush trap.</p><p>6. It's go time: Kuan began moving and it worked in our favor because Chao was struggling so hard to find the last mush, torturing Frieda. Stephen died of starvation and everyone else was doing their normal things. Kuan got wacked for being suspicious as hell. Lots of humans were getting illnesses and proving humanity so it was getting desperate and Chao wanted to print the list.</p><p><em>Finola</em> during this was trying her hardest to blend in and was doing a great job at deflecting blame off me. Eventually though I was looking suspect and if I died <em>Finola</em> would follow because even Janice was getting suspicious of her. We had to move.</p><p><em>Finola</em> and I planned to mush Gioele, Hua, and Chao at day change over. <em>Finola</em> moves in with 2 missions from Chao. Removes alpha dorm camera, finishes Gioele as I finish Hua. Walk up to the bridge and finish Chao at day change. All 3 of which who were active at the time. Anonymushed and proceeded hilarity from having Chao on your side.</p><p>Still lots of information to go but the jist of it.</p>

I couldn't post in the "favorite conversations" thread about all the fun antics behind closed doors, since it was an ongoing game and I didn't want to give away anything to anyone currently playing.</p><p>But yeah, fun times. Finola and Eleesha, you guys had like an Ocean's 11 level of coordination going on there. Brilliant. Thanks for taking me along on the ride.</p>
