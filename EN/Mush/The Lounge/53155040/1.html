                <p>Hello! In this AP we will be talking about <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9269">THIS</a> ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> As You can see from finnal page, it is one of those fully converted Sol returns. One done absolutly stealthy and without any human really noticing anything mushy going on untill VERY late in game...</p><p>But insted of talking of it, I think I should introduce myself... Right? Good idea? Bad idea? Of course it is good idea! So let's give it a try!</p><p>I am <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico">, the Alpha Mush for that ship. And this will be my story... Story of my hardship, moments of despair, sudden victories, plans both well and poorly made, lucky streacks and my ultimate victory...</p><p><strong><em>WHY ELEESHA?</em></strong><br>I saw two choices in my character roster... It was Eleesha or Derek. Nothing more. Well... My third choice was to wait and see what my new choices will be. But I decided I will go on with one out of those two. Derek... Nah! I don't feel like playing as Derek. But I totally like play as Eleesha. Especially since I can bring with myself few GREAT skills (Tech for example) that are of wonderfull use for Ship and her crew. I am not one of crazy Eleesha Players that never miss any logs, count all AP on ship and store tons of logs that were coppied. Absolutly not that kind of Eleesha player I am (not saying I am not hunting for mushes - I do! Just I am not one of those ultra effective players in that). I just reconed that having active and high level Eleesha with good skills will be anyway better for ship than having no Eleesha at all. So I took it! Yay! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Begining...</strong><br>And here I was, Eleesha, standing in Lab. I quickly took <em>Tracker</em> as my first and for now only skill and decided to take care of more important things for me than Mush... After all, what could happen in such short time, right? Well... So here I come and... You know? Actually in matter of those 10 - 15 minutes "Something has changed..." <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I was a <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> now! An Alpha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>You see... It seems that Derek camed to our ship just shortly after I did. And I happened to be lucky one that had a pleassure to be Alpha Mush on very active ship! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>My very first move was to check on Mush Channel and see who is other Alpha Mush... And than I froze in fear... It was Paola... My Coalpha Mush was Paola - Comm Officer... And what is more, I just realized that I am second in line for that position... So if She would go inactive, died or mutated and ramapged... Yes! Than I would be stuck with this work. And it would be just terrible situation to be in... I could do exacly NOTHING than without exposing myself...</p><p>Worse than that was that it seemed that our Paola was indeed inactive... She said something at begining I think and than total silence. Well... Best way to find out if She will be active or not was to just... ASK! And so I wrote to Her, asking if She will be active. Guees what? She was active. She was active and scared as She lacked expirience as an Alpha Mush. Also her English was not too good... It was hard to communicate with my Mush Partner, but She seemed to be willing to try Her best. She also DID understood me pretty well and listened to me. I gave her only one mission - STAY ALIVE! DO COMM WORK AND LOOK HUMAN. That was ONLY thing I expected from Paola. And She did that definietly. Paola - if You are reading this, it is job well done! You gave me eounght time to create eoungh betas to make sure no organized killing will ever happen! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But back than I didn't knew Paola will prove to be capable partner... What is worse, She tried to do First Rebel Base insted of pursuing few Xylophs and doing NERON Update or two... That made Her just to get in center of attention. Negative attention that is...</p><p>Now THIS was my worse moment on this entire ship. There was no worse one! I expected Paola to get killed soon, and me taking Her post only to be killed also soon for not eating all the time... What was worse, because I was <em>IT Expert</em> and <em>Polymath</em> I was expected to help in research... So by the end of D1 we had <em>AntiSpore Gas</em> deployed and <em>CSerum</em> was on it's way. I haven't even managed to extract spores... And I had no acces to bed... And no valid reasons to enter Bravo Dorm...</p><p>Yes! All beds were taken by crewmembers already... So both ADorm and BDorm were full. I had to find solution to that, and it would be best if I could grab bed from Bravo Dorm of course...</p><p><strong>Perfect Solution</strong><br>I could not enter to BDorm without raising suspicions... But I could ask somebody from BDorm to tell me about who is in there... And here I got lucky! I got VERY lucky as one of BDorm residents was nobody else than <em>Paranoid Gioele</em>. Yes! He took a bed. Nothing bad - He might have been one of first that woke up... So obviously He would took bed. But! But he did hold it with only <em>Paranoid</em> while I was <em>Technican</em> and <em>Tracker</em>. It was obvious that I needed that bed more than he did.</p><p>And so I didn't wasted any second, and just holded on my luck! You see... I strongly believe that, while luck is totally random thing, ability to USE it, to catch that lucky moment and get the best of it is actually an ability. So... Was I lucky? YES! But I also knew HOW use that luck and how make best out of it... And that is totally dependent on me...</p><p>But what I did actually? Firstly I asked our <em>Commander Jin Su</em> to check me in Rear Corridor, to see that I am NOT dirty and to comfirm that I never ever was at Bravo Dorm before - so I could not spore before. <em>Jin Su</em> did that - and so I got my entry to Bravo Dorm. Than I just kicked off <em>Gioele</em> and took His bed. That was easy, and I had resonable claim on bed... So that was FIRST good thing that happened on this ship for me - I managed to grab myself a bed that was in Bravo Dorm. First WIN!</p><p><strong>D1 activity...</strong><br>Apart of helping in anti-mush research I also took part in our first expedition - I must say that humans were lucky with starting planet. There was high chance to somebody get illnes, but also I wanted to get dirty legitimatly - that was before I got bed in BDorm. Well... That plan failed - as I didn't got dirty. I could still go out of IBay and extract spores and declare myself to be dirty from expo - but something told me to not do that... That it was dangerous... AND I WAS RIGHT! Later in game I learned that <em>Jin Su</em> checked me about being dirty right after expo and I would not get away with THIS!</p><p>Funny thing is that there was great opportunity to convert <em>Terrence</em> at D1... He was in Nexus and had 1 starting spore on himself... So easy convertion... But I decided to not... And that was good decision as I stated before - <em>Jin Su</em> would blow my head off...</p><p>Also <em>Hua</em> got comfirmed to be human after expo - that illnes I was talking about before - it happened to Her. And so She could substitute inactive Chun... Well... Not in 100% (not immune) but still...</p><p><strong><em>TO BE CONTINUED</em></strong></p>

                <p><strong><em>Even more bad news!!!</em></strong><br>So just as I got my first "small" victory around by grabbing Bed in Bravo Dorm... And than this happened... <em>Gioele</em>, after being knocked off from bed got suddenly active and installed both of His cameras in Lab and Nexus. So no more easy Nexus conversions for me... But then something even WORSE happened! <em>Stephen</em> decided to use His <em>Apprentince</em> to copy <em>Paranoid</em> from <em>Gioele</em>!!! Can You imagine that? This ship had actually SEVEN cameras that were able to watch in addition Medlab and Icarus Bay... So no more easy <em>Andie</em> conversion or Expo Sporing. Nope... And at D2 Myco Alars started to be researched with quite speed by Andie and her research team...</p><p>You know what I did? I will tell You what... I just logged off. I had eoungh bad news for now. I decided to just log off and take some rest. I was VERY VERY VERY demoralized by this... And I was honestly SO DAMN TEMPTED TO JUST DISMANTLE ALL EXTINGUISHERS AND SET SHIP ON FIRE! (I had exp to lvl up to get pyro) That was it - logging off and getting some rest from Mush seemed like best thing to do...</p><p><strong>Derek Converted! My first Beta!</strong><br>Now... In all that story above, I haven't wrote a thing about me extracting spores. Reason for that is that I don't remember when I exacly did that, but I did pulled out 2 spores (<em>Fertile</em> and <em>Infector</em> so far) before CSerum got finished... I did stealthy showered also. But I have no idea now when that was really...</p><p>Anyway... I logged off as I had eoungh for some time. Situation seemed awfull - <em>Paola</em> will be killed surely soon, I will become Comm Officer and now there are 7 cameras on this ship. I got BDorm bed, but so what when I will end up as Comm Officer and will have to use Sofa? All seemed for nothing...</p><p>But! But before I went to sleep this day, I decided to check what is going on in Mush... And than... A small light of hope showed! Aparently RNG decided that begining of D2 is BEST moment to start a fire in two places... And ship didn't had Fire Detector yet... So what happened? Our <em>Derek</em> picked third skill - Firefighter and started to move around... I think that He realized it will be hard to find where fires are all by himself and just decided to wait in FC for others to at lest mention where fire is NOT. I honestly can understand Him in doing so... We sometimes act lazy, we think to ourselfs "It is just few minutes in game where turn takes 3 hours! What can go wrong it that time?!". When I saw single dot in FC on my tracker and saw that Derek is asking about location of fires I KNEW it was Him. And I knew that He had 1 spore from start...</p><p>You know what was even better? <em>Ian</em> just finished researching <em>Lenses</em> for our pilots... And I camed JUST IN TIME to help looking for fires, take <em>Lenses</em> from Lab and bring it to Alpha Dorm... What a luck! Luck that I embraced in just one second... Bravo Bay... Quick glance at tracker - Derek is still in FC. Ok! Moving out to Central Corridor... Yes! He is still in there... BUT! But what if it is NOT Derek? Than I just go for those damn lenses... Ok! Going to FC... YES!!! It is indeed Derek! Yay! Ok! Quick Europa... Be quick and decided... Now! INFECT! Good! Infection lvl 2... INFECT! Derek joined The Mush! QUICK Europa! Anonymush... And great! Off I go to Lab! Take lenses and to Alpha Dorm... And check few rooms at back of ship to see if there is fire...</p><p>WAIT! What is that? <em>Raluca's</em> Turret has <em>Scooter</em>... Hmm... Nobody will hopefully see me getting it ^^ And so I hid Grenade and took Scooter from RAT. And <em>Raluca</em>? Never Mind Her, She rarely was saying anything and She was not using that turret anyway... NOBODY saw me taking that scooter. And I could always use it to hide my AP usage... Humans would think I used more AP for moving than I indeed done ^^</p><p>So... Begining of D2 was turning point on this ship... At lest for me... As I saw that I am able to actually pull off some conversions without anybody noticing a thing...</p><p><em><strong>TO BE CONTINUED... Tommorow! ^^</strong></em></p>

                <p>At the threat of double posting, I feel the Paola situation needs to be explained. You see, due to Paola's activity schedule, we had trouble passing the couch over to her at the start. At the end of every cycle, there would be no sign of Paola and either Frieda or I would take the sofa on the bridge so that the AP did not go to waste.</p><p>Then Paola would come online before we got back to the game in the next cycle, make a post about how the sofa on the bridge was taken and how much she was struggling with AP and then go inactive again so that by the time we logged in and got off the sofa, the same song and dance repeated again. She was still spending all of her AP on comms, so AP counting would have made no difference, but it shifted the 'blame' for the situation to us. At least in our minds.</p><p>Then she tried - and failed - to get the D2 base. Now, I know on some ships she would have been killed at this point, but she was not some borderline inactive griefer. She was active often, if only in short bursts, and she was very communicative and willing to help/learn. It didn't help that we as humans, in our efforts to teach her, started an argument about what the 'correct' way to play Paola at the start was. Whether to hit Neron upgrades first, or do Xyloph until you get Kivanc first. Now if we as 'good' players couldn't agree on what she was supposed to have done, could we really have killed her for not doing that?</p><p>She was playing the communicative newbie to a tee - which I later discovered was not so far from the truth.</p><p>Besides, it was only day 2. The important bases only began the next day and Paola managed to grab the D3 base with no issues.</p>

                <p>Nice to see You joining in TerryMerry <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> From what I saw (my impression - I can be wrong) You actually started your own Mush Hunt at certian point of this trip... And You started to talk about things with me and with Andie... But it was already pretty much too late to do any change. Even killing me would not change anything really. And from what I remember Andie made sure You actually looked positively on Eleesha, rather than with suspicions <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And hello Jin Su - my right hand in conversions! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And great that You explained how this issue with Paola started and how it went on... Good to know how it seemed from Your (yet human) point of view <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Finnaly hello Frieda! Your attendance at research and providing Andie all those relays was... Problematic. You were real pain in my... Ehh... Forget it &gt;.&lt; Well played Frieda! Indeed well played <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Good job! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now... We should go on, right?</p><p><strong>D2 later activity...</strong><br>So at begining of D2 (it was C1?) I managed to stealthy convert Derek... And nobody noticed! Derek was surprised and I do hope it was nice lesson for Him that standing in unmonitored room is not safe... But what after that happened?</p><p>Well... I spend part of D2C1 (???) on talking to Derek and Paola, and then I went sleep <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> We haven't formed any plans or anything like that yet. We were just glad that there is now 3 of us! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And it was for me time to get some sleep...</p><p>Second day went actually without any major Mush Play from my side after getting Derek. Untill D3 we all played humans and tried to look doing our jobs (in my case I helped a lot with NEXUS and a bit with research, Paola was still without Sofa, but She put every AP of Her into Comm Work, and Derek made sure to extinguish all fires and also kept on some AP in case of mush rampage - to be able to extract spores really). And time slowly went on... At end of D2 we made plans that Hua should get infected with at lest one spore, so that I could just finish Her off by double spiking somewhere... Derek and I decided that <em>Trapper</em> will be best way to get Hua with first spore. And so Derek took <em>Traper</em> and spored Alpha Bay. We did hoped to get Hua - She was by now comfirmed human and hence, person of public trust. Moreover Hua was gold, active and communicative person. Somebody You definietly want to have on YOUR side, not against You...</p><p><strong>D3 is comming...</strong><br>So new day has come... And with it camed big change of our plans... You see... When I was sleeping, our great Commander Jin Su decided to shoot some hunters...</p><p><em>Jin Su contaminated by Derek - infection lvl 1</em></p><p>Yes... Insted of Hua, we hit Jin Su. It turned out to be actually BEST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN ON THIS SHIP! But well... Let's keep track on our story, shall we? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So when I was sleeping, our dear Paola took advice of crew to work on Xyloph now. And She did hit one of those Comm Lost Signal data bases... And we were without signal as for now. I decided that it will be perfect way of helping ship, extracting some spores AND keep my human face still on...</p><p>So off I went - to lab in order to help with some research (spore sucker I think - AGas, CSerum, MycoAlarms, Lenses and MScanner were already done by that time), to help Paola with establishing comms and... And then I went back to BDorm for stealth shower, self heal and I went off to work...</p><p>WRONG!!! Of course it was totally diffrent! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I knew that Jin Su got that spore from trap in ABay... I also knew that He will get online IN THIS CYCLE! So I made sure that I will work slowly on things... I wanted to make sure that I will met Him BEFORE I will go to work (and off from Mush).</p><p>And so when I helped with Comms and was getting back to Dorm, thinking that Jin Su will not manage to show up this time on time (what a sentence!), suddenly miracle has happened! He got active! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Right when I was in Central Corridor! Quick decision on my part - two spores extracted in CC (yes, that was not planned actually, I didn't wanted to loose AP for nothing, I wanted to be sure I will use it). Now I was dirty, which was problem since active Jin Su was in BDorm... So I decided that this is time for me to try how much I can risk... I entered Bravo Bay and contacted Jin Su directly in private message...</p><p>I asked Jin Su to do me a favor... I asked Him if He could steep out into Bravo Bay (where I was standing dirty with two spores just ready to infect Him with) and comfirm me to be clean before I will enter BDorm...</p><p>"But Europa! Who in right mind would agree to do such think? It was obvious trap!!!"</p><p>Well... It was obvious trap indeed WHEN YOU READ ABOUT IT! But things get diffrent when on board, when You are in rush (Real Life) and when You are just woken up (Yes, I knew our JS just woke up and would be slower on reaction)... Moreover I did asked for exacly same favor before few times... And I always was clean. Jin Su also, thanks to Myco Scanner, knew that He never got any more spores than one He had (He assumed that it was His starting spore - it was not! It was spore from Derek's Trapper). And on top of that, by that time I was greatly active in NEXUS, Research and I walked ship a lot (remember that I had my Scooter in inventory - nobody knew about that, even though Hua thought that I have it despite not seeing any logs of me taking it - She just assumed I as Eleesha holded it). So in short - Jin Su had good reasons to actually listen to me and he just did what I asked for... He walked out and...</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">ELEESHA: Could You steep out to comfirm me not being dirty?<br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico">JIN SU: Yes...

Please, tell me at lest that You are an Alpha...<br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">ELEESHA: Yes, I am an alpha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Welcome to the winning team!</p><p>So this is how it went... Quick and precise <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Jin Su is now Mush... And from now on He was my right hand in every future conversion! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Janice is dying...</strong><br>Allright people... I missed one thing in my story... Janice's death... Reason for that is that I honestly have no idea WHEN that happened. I mean I was online when that happened and I didn't hide being active, but I have no idea when that was... D2? Or even end of D1? I just... Don't remember!!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So... About Janice... She was very active and extremly not carefull... She made tons of mistakes. Gameplay wise, She did contributed to research and nexus work... She took nice skills - first three, and by that She showed to us that She is gold player with lvl 3 Janice... But She also was getting dirty a lot of time, every now and than. It looked honestly as She would play on Mush Free ship! Getting dirty out of nowhere, than few hours later reporting it and staying dirty... Than showering herself only to get out and get dirty again... At some point She just did one mistake too much... Our Stephen didn't wanted to risk anything and killed Her. Just like that... No disscusion. No warning... He just woke up and punched her to death...</p><p>And guess what? I think He did right!!! Well... He did awfull job at NOT COMMUNICATING, but decision to off that Janice was right one. She was making it even harder for humans to spot mush by being BIGGES ATTENTION MAGNET!</p><p>And to answer Rolands finnal question - Stephen was just uncommunicative human when He killed Janice. If He would not do that, Hua would or somebody else from mush hunt channel. We were seriously fed up with that Janice... I think I was only one who tried to make Her to live longer... Even Ian called for Her blood (exagerration - He just agreed with Stephen's decision). So I will repeat myself here - Stephen did good by killing Janice, but did VERY BAD by not talking this over with anybody before doing so... At lest nobody admited to talk with Him, and I can say that none of mushes pushed Him to do that either!</p><p><strong><em>TO BE CONTINUED... Tommorow! ^^</em></strong></p>

                <p>Ah yes, alas poor Janice, I knew her well. Well, not really. I barely saw her. Next thing I knew Stephen had punched a hole in her head and we were shrinkless. You gotta understand how that looked... first picking paranoid with his Apprentice, then offing our only shrink... when we had no shrink books.</p><p>Kinda suspicious, wouldn't you say? I was honestly in favour of killing him right after. If only to stop the mush from thinking they could get away with killing someone randomly. However, I knew I was not confirmed, nor was I even in the Mush Hunt channel at that stage. If I acted alone, I would be no better than psychopath Stephen.</p><p>In the end, my decision was made for me when I stepped outside to check Eleesha's dirtyness. Let's just say, she was very dirty. What that transcript does not mention was the short silence after Eleesha told me to pick Anonymush as<br>1) My brain tried to process what she was saying<br>2) My trembling finger clicked the refresh button, fearing the worst<br>3) I put my head in my hands at how stupid I had been<br>4) I reluctantly selected anonymush as my Queen ordered</p><p>Needless to say, I felt rather stupid at the time.

                <p>And good evening <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Time for another chapter in my little story <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It is nice to hear how it looked from Your point of view Commander Jin Su <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Indeed, You are right about moment of silence <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Now at last I do know why there was that moment <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> It is always funny to see reactions of people who just got converted... Especially when they haven't expected that to happen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I bet I also am able to create funny reactions <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Anyway... Let's see what we do have here...</p><p>Ah! <span class="tid_user tid_user_8721697 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8721697">Blahsadfeguie</span>... Welcome into mine AP Thread <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I am VERY glad to know that You do enjoy it and like story so far. I will add one chapter per day, usually at very evening <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Like now...</p><p>So... Shall we go on with story? Or will we just decide to stop here and let You write Your own imaginary story of what did happened? Interesting how You all would do that... But I choose to tell shat story still! Ha! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Time starts to melt...</strong><br>Right... So far I was able to point out most of important things with precision of days... It is no longer the case. From now on I will have no idea when exacly, at which day something did happened. From now on I can be expected to remember what happened first, what second and what after that... But not when it did happened. So I will no longer bother with dates <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Anti-mush research goes on... And how do we react on it...</strong><br>Somewhere betwen Jin Su getting that spore from trapper and him getting converted, humans managed to complete MycoScanner. That alone made it impossible for us to slowly convert humans. From now on, any future conversion had to be done in blitz. It didn't mattered a lot since so far we could be doing just that... Terrence and Roland also had one starting spore. We could moreover just gather 3 spores (preferably I 2 and Jin Su 1) and spike one target at once and convert... But we could not use trapper anymore. At lest not without higher risk.</p><p>Moreover humans finished MycoAlarms - those I think were made even before MycoScanner was made? Or right after? Doesn't matter really. 7 cameras and 4 mycoalarms were somewhere on this ship. That alone was making things harder and gave me feeling of being hunted... But now humans were comming in with Spore Sucker as well... So we had to act really fast to get Terrence and Roland before they will extract those starting spores. We just had to...</p><p>Wait! Umm... No. Actually... No, we hadn't!!! Yea... Why rush? There was 4 of us already and they didn't saw anything going on. And we could convert them as days are changing. So why interfere? They will get rid of starting spores... They will feel safe... They will NOT FIND any more spores on MycoScanners. Either somebody gets fully converted at once, or not even spiked once. And with that we went!</p><p><strong>Walks with Terrence... </strong><br>Terrence had serious problems with his AP and MP conversions... Perhaps because of being Terrence <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Well... He needed to get to Lab or at Bridge few times to help with something. I really do not remember what exacly needed to be done. All I remember is that we did wanted to work on research pretty hard - we wanted to finish UHP as it is great research to be done (and I had eoungh of being hurted for 4HP while showering and getting only 3HP from selfhealing) and than I waned us to finish Natamy Rifle (which I would have given to Derek to "secure"<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">. So there we went! Terrence and I... We met in Central Corridor, than we went to Front Corridor... We worked tirelesly on research and... And He refused to work on Natamy Rifle - as he said, He hates that research. Gueess what? I totally understand that and accept it. He was not researcher, but Tech. So Him not helping in research made perfect sense anyway. So off we went back to His Alpha Dorm.</p><p>It was funny that when talking with me, Terrence mentioned possible Oxygene rampage (yes, we had Oxy problems - at this time we could easily actually suffocate ship and ask our Derek to blow as many heads as possible. That would effectively finished ship in fasion that we didn't wanted it to be finished. We wanted ship to find Oxygene Rich planet, but we also wanted to manipulate... You know what? I will make separate part for this one, and will just go on with Terry, right? Thanks! I knew You will agree with this course of actions. You don't agree? Your problem as I am the one writing story. You just read (or not). <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Anyway, Terrence explained his worries about lack of oxygene (low amount actually) and later while in Lab (I REMEMBER! Commander wanted to give speech in Lab - that is why so many people went there and I with Terry as well), Terrence said to me that he is affraid of grenade attacks in such crowded rooms so he would like us to get back to dorm as soon as possible. Well... Little He knew that grenade was safe with me - hidden in RAT. Blaster was safe in my inventory... Yea... Hua holded knife - that was only not safe weapon ^^ And Hua was so willing to do some killing... Too bad that there was constant lack of decisivness in "Human" Channel. Oh! Yes! I did added there Jin Su, Andie and bit later Frieda. And Jin Su with me - we were occasionally pointing fingers at each other... We did what was needed to make humans undecided and unable to get any conclusion done.</p><p>Anyway, I went to Lab with Terrence, than I returned with Him to ADorm. Guess what? Not even single spore landed on Him. Not now... And there was another such trip in future... I also helped Him to get to Lab and back - again, I haven't put even one spore into Him... I do hope that Terrence was trustfull because of that toward me. But I will fiish "Terrence Theme" here for now - we will get back to Terry in future. Maybe tomorow?</p><p>What is important is that we choose to play it bit lower for some time - we needed to put diffrent kind of attack on ship and it's human crew - to keep them concentrated on things diffrent than mushes, to make them panick a bit and to sow more paranoia and lack of decisivnes...</p>

                <p><strong>Operation "Oxytoxy and no morale for You!"</strong><br>So as I told earlier, we did had something in our minds. Something nasty with Oxygene and Morale... So this is what Jin Su and I planned for - we wanted to cause Oxygene crisis in order to move ship while Paola had to decode 6 Morale Rebel Base... We wanted to use Oxygene Crisis as excuse to bring Morale Crisis. That would allow us controll crew more as we had Leader Commander on board - at that point our only source of morale.</p><p>Guess what? It worked as charm! We created Oxy problem, sow disorganization into humans and made them accept loss of Morale Rebel Base. That helped Paola to do some Comm Work and show that She is really putting every single AP into that work. Just like any human would do! Here I would like to thank Ian for finding that Oxy plnet. If not for that we would have to end ship with rampage just to make sure there would be no fast PILGRED and Sol Return for humans. Or we would repair that PILGRED after converting Techs. One way or another, but we would loose possibility to convert You all. That would be sad.</p><p>Additional benefit of morale crisis was that now everybody was thinking twice before killing somebody. And it didn't helped that our silent Raluca took Mr. Cat from Lab and... And I don't know where She did put it. Really <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Again, Ian found it and brought to Lab.</p><p>But our great plan to cause morale crisis didn't went without problems. Actually it did firedback at us slightly... Andie became Confidiant... And with that She just become extremly dangerous obstacle on our way to convert Hua...</p><p><strong>Change of plans!!! Opportunity showed up! Let's get it!</strong><br>So... We went on expo and got that oxygene. Ship was safe from suffocation for good. But we had problem - we could not get our hands on Hua in any way. And when we thought we had perfect occasion - Andie becomed Confidient and could easily track our mush activity... We simply could NOT just ignore those 2 Morale per day and still look human. Not on this ship. And so we were wondering what to do with this... To grab Hua or maybe Andie first? Eventually we decided to go with Hua. She was comfirmed human since D1 after all... Getting Her into our team was like winning war... Or at lest learning everything what our opponent can know about us, what are his plans and how to counter them. SO pretty much - that would be winning move.</p><p>BUT! But for some reasons (I don't remember them exacly - but those were good reasons) Andie camed to RC and waited for Jin Su's decision about something... We started discusion in our Mush Channel about this opportunity... And I have feeling that things were going to slow with making decision. Jin Su kind of wanted to grab Andie now, but was willing to wait for occasion to grab Hua bit later. Derek was carefull and didn't wanted to act in rush. Paola was out of game as Comm Officer. She just needed to act human and absolutly NOT as mush. So what I did? The same what I did when Derek and Jin Su were in my reach...</p><p>ELEESHA: That is it! I am going for conversion. Grabbing one spore. Jin Su and Derek, follow me and convert Her. Now!</p><p>And so it happened. Once I went for it there was no more turning back, no more disscusion. We just had to do it. I do have feeling that if I would not acted and Andie would stayed in RC longer - Jin Su would eventually go for conversion. But I decided that I didn't wanted to wait and disscus when things were needed to be done actually. When luck gives you chance - You grab it. Hard learned lesson for me that is.</p><p>And so in matter of three or four seconds Andie got converted... Fifth Mush on board!!!</p><p>And this is also a story about ME loosing my temper! Derek actually panicked, as He thought that direct spiking is visible in logs for everybody... And He didn't took Anonymush in 5 minutes!!! Can You imagine that? For 5 minutes there were 3 Yellow guys up there! On Comrade Bar. How we managed to get away with that? I have no idea! I know that Ian was surely online that moment... But He haven't saw for some reasons. Eventually Derek did took anonymush and we could calm down a bit...</p><p><em><strong>TO BE CONTINUED... Tommorow! ^^</strong></em></p>

                <p>We had just gotten the oxygen and needed someone to load fuel. Andie happened to be online and had something to do in the rear of the ship anyway - Projects I think, we had run out of research to do by this point - and offered to load the fuel for us. The only problem? He had to check in whether it still needed to be done. And he decided to stand in RC while he waited for me to respond. Nice of him, wasn't it?</p><p>I remember Derek's little panic attack. <br>"Guys guys, someone needs to deface RC!

RC..."<br>"DEREK PICK F---ING ANONYMUSH!"<br><br>It wasn't really five minutes. About a minute, if I recall. It certainly felt like three cycles had gone by before that third yellow dude finally disappeared. We were pretty sure we had been spotted at that point. We had Derek conserve every single AP he could with a very simple instruction: if killing starts... any killing at all... here is your list of priority targets. In order.<br><br>And thus was born the Paola Protection Act. While it quickly turned out that the humans had indeed NOT seen us, their suspicion of Paola remained and we decided not to rescind Derek's standing orders, merely updating his list of targets as humans were converted to our side, and gave him special instructions to keep a close eye on what happens to our little Paola. We were starting to feel very protective of her at that point. She had, after all, survived a hell of a lot of suspicion, including missing the morale base that put everyone in this position.<br><br>And dag-nabbit, she was going to survive if we had anything to say about it. The humans never knew this, as they suspected Paola in the coming days, but if they had harmed a hair on her head, Derek would have landed on them with the full force of the avenging reaper. And the Natamy. Because that thing still hurts, even if you are human.</p>

How dare you! converting these poor human people into Mush while I was getting thrown with 3 grenades in another ship.</span></p><p>Well done Europa. I still try to compare the ship with mine where I managed to convert crew. Comparing, found you have something harder and something easier, but generally harder than me in the season before. Even with well-secured ships I managed to convert 1-2 betas although research pretty going on and having 2 skill slots. Your conversation with Jin Su while converting reminded me the ship where people thought they were Mush free and I waited for certain human to be active so I could convert while doing project. <em>"Oh you... but ok. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">"</em> And this feeling when you're Alpha Mush and more and more human become Mush, making conversion fun, and it wouldn't be done without you... you did it with better outcome, 13 agents of Mush onboard all alive. How was it possible? More skill slots and better level? 7 cameras and research going on, everything going fine, I can't imagine anybody else doing such job.</p><p>By the way reading that all... did you even know where MycoAlarms were put? When you were converting Andie, did you take a risk that the MycoAlarm could be there and Andie stayed there as a bait? What about Terrence - you didn't infect him, was it because of MycoAlarms? And I hope you won't skip "Print the LIST" event, how funny it looked on such ship.</p>

You are most helpful... Just like on that ship You were <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Just like on that ship ^^</p><br><br><p>Ehh ehh ehh... Bit late here... Tommorow to work... So I beter do it now, right? Of course I am right! Let's write it!</p><p><strong>Let's talk - Andie!</strong><br>Andie was our main and dedicated researcher. For whole time it looked that She will become either Devoted for speeding up our research considerably (like it woudl mattered any at all) or a Pilot so She could do expeditions alone, without risk of harm on landing. But as Janice was killed, third option had to be taken into account - Confidient, to help in mush hunting AND take care of crew's morale.</p><p>That was an indirect threat to mushes and their plans, as we could simply not ignore it. We had to confide from time to time. I remember that I did so once, when I was sure that there will be no Mushy actions showed up - when Andie was still human.</p><p>But now... Now Andie was actually a Mush. And a great ally that we could use to finnaly reach Hua... You see... Hua was for us a bit like some kind of Land Lord... She was safely sitting in Her fortress where nothing could touch Her. She was always in Alpha Dorm under camera. If not there, than in IB under camera. She was avoiding being in unmonitored places and was always protected. What was worse, She was absolutly spore free and as first comfirmed human She holded knife all the time.</p><p>Hua was sitting in fortress, fortifyed and protected by Her guards. She was KEY to complete controll of this ship and it's fate. Humans knew she was comfirmed and they saw her input into ship's well being... And Andie was key to THE KEY. And beside that, She surely has knew something about secret "Human only" chanel that was set up by Hua... Right? RIGHT?</p><p>Nope! Imagine this - when I converted Derek I firstly asked mu one, simple question: Tell me what You know! About mush Hunt... About suspicions... Who want me dead? Anything really!</p><p>His answer was "I know nothing... Jin Su was a bit suspicious about You at one time but that was it really..."</p><p>Than I converted Jin Su and same question was asked to Him... His answer had even less substance - I know nothing...</p><p>Allright I thought... Derek could not know anything... Jin Su also... That only means Hua is very carefull and will add to her Secret Human Chanel only those who has been not only comfirmed to be humans, but also comfirmed directly by her in way that left no place for mistakes... Andie was such person of course... So when She got infected it was only natural for me to ask her that question...</p><p>"Tell me everything Andie!"</p><p>Guess what was Her answer? Yes! You guessed it! "I know nothing!" WTF? You have to be kidding me!!!</p><p><strong>Who is hunting mushes on this ship???</strong><br>I know how it looked - either there was Mush Hunt channel that consisted only of like Hua and maybe Terrence (he was by far one of most trustfull crewmembers on board despite never being comfirmed) or there was NO mush hunt channel at all! One or another...</p><p>Yes! You have guessed it! There was no organized effort to hunt me down. That means... No organized effort apart of channel formed by me! At this point "Human Channel" was more mushy than human. Eleesha, Derek, Jin Su and Andie were already Mushes. Hua, Frieda, Ian and Chun (inactive) were humans. Just look at that! We outnumbered them in Mush Hunt channel. One by one, comfirmed humans were becoming mushes... There was nobody at this point to hunt for us... And thanks to our efforts, ship remained undecisive to the extreme. Only decisions that were fitting US could be made. Of course we could not stop Hua from suddenly killing somebody - if She wanted to do that, She would just do that. That is why we haven't felt secured. We knew that vicotry was already ours, but we could have suffered losses... Or even have to part with Sol victory - if Hua and rest of humans would get lucky. That is why we still thought that converting Hua was important...</p><p>Whole this time I was sure that Hua is THE KEY to everything... As it was, there wre no keys on this ship...</p><p><strong>Operation "Happy Icarus Bay" and why did it failed...</strong><br>Plan was made - we had sutiable planet ready for expedition... There was Crystal zone so we could hope for starmap fragment... Since Mushes were in high number it was easy to make sure that voting for expedition will get apropriate outcome... And here we plan to do it! I was unable to be at that time active - that was bad. But Jin Su, Derek and Andie - they could...</p><p>So here is the plan - Hua, Jin Su, Derek and Andie - they go into IB to prepare for expo. Than JS, Andie and Derek - they all extract spores right in front of Hua, right in front of camera - in Icarus Bay and do spike Her shamelessly. This had to be done ASAP. After that Hua could deface room logs and nobody would saw anything - remaining humans either didn't enteres IB at all, or were not paying attention to Logs...</p><p>Plan was perfect, right? Nothing could go wrong, right? Well... Something DID go wrong unfortunatly...</p><p>Do you remember Raluca? Oh... I haven't told You about our Raluca yet? Well... I should have!</p><p><em>Let's talk Raluca...</em><br>Raluca was RPing member of our crew. Her RPing consisted of as little messages as possible. They were as short as possible and she wasn't communicating with anybody untill asked to. Even than it was VERY hard to get answer from her. But She was doing a lot usefull things for ship. She was helpfull and despite not answering (or to be precise, answering very little and in limited way) in public chat, She was doing what we asked Her to do most of time... Later, when converted She became very active and talkactive. But before that we considered Her to be... To just be on ship and nothing more. She was helpfull to the ship so we didn't mind. I bet humans' point of view was exacly the same about Raluca. Worse thing about Her was not lack of communication at begining, but Her random walks. She was constantly in move and You could not predict what will She do next...</p><p>So what went wrong with our plan? You guessed it! Raluca entered IB and so our brave team could NOT begin conversion of Hua. Raluca was not communicating, but She DID proved earlier that She is able to communicate when want to. Extracting spores in front of her would be deadly for mushes... And would lead to open fight... And that we wanted to avoid at all cost...</p><br><p><strong><em>Pef... Long. And it is late. Ok! I am finishing it here. Tommorow You will learn how it went after, how expo went and what happened to Hua <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> See You than! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><br></em></strong></p>

                <p>Operation Happy Icarus Bay was actually planned before we had even converted Andie. The problem we kept running into then, of course, was how would we convince the ship that it was okay for Andie NOT to come on an expedition so that the 3 of us could go and convert Hua in Icarus Bay.</p><p>Converting Andie was actually in order to unlock the possibility of converting Hua in IB. With Andie on our side, we controlled every person who usually joined Expo... except Hua. It would be reasonable that a deface would not be spotted for 24h, especially if I 'delayed' our leaving the planet and moving to the next one. Or if we just all go as the same people again.</p><p>Remember, no matter how many cameras and Mycos the humans have, if no human enters a room for the next 24h, you can do whatever the hell you please in there.</p>

                <p>That's true, Patryk, but that still meant Raluca was standing NEXT to IB. We had no way to prevent her from entering next time she moved and seeing our deface. Also, Derek and Eleesha were inactive the next time we did an expo, and while I could have delayed it, I decided to instead teach Raluca a lesson... to scare her away from even entering IB again to give us space to work.</p><p>I launched the expo across a cycle change. On a ship with morale issues already, losing that 1 morale would come as a shock. Hopefully she wouldn't stop in IB again.</p>

                <p>Right right Patryk! I made few mistakes <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Well... That one was very funny actually if You ask me ^^</p><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_489025 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="489025">Ayon</span> - how can I do it? I will tell You how... I can do it WITH PLEASURE <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Honestly... You think that making one, short message would be interesting AP? Bah! I find my way better <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It keeps You interested... It can build up tension from chapter to chapter if needed... And it gives You reasons to come back here and read. You do have something to wait for! Isn't that awesome? I am sure it is! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So... Let's see what it is time to write now about... Hmm... I think it has finnaly come time to tell You story about Hua's fall... Yes! We will go to that now!</p><br><p><strong>Besieging Castle...</strong><br>Allright. Last time I compared Hua's position to be well fortified, protected by strong walls of castle. Her position was not endangered by anything but violent Mush Rampage - only that could have touched Her directly (or indirectly - morale). Anything else what we could do was far away from affecting Her directly. Sure! Our Mush Hunt channel - now controlled firmly by Mushes - could influence Her, but She could have just out of sudden decided to kill somebody who She does suspect... And that somebody could be for example ME or Paola... She was comfirmed Human, She had knife... She was in general - trusted person on board... And it is hard to get somebody like that without acting openly - which was not an option for us. We aimed for totally stealthy conversion of crew...</p><p>And so we planned how to get Hua converted without making it obvious for everybody else...</p><p><strong>Another Expo Plan</strong><br>Most logical proposition to convert Hua was just another expedition. Last time it didn't worked only because we got unlucky with Raluca. If not for that, we would have Hua by now. But we didn't and needed to try another one, with hopes that Raluca will NOT go into IB again. As Jin Su said, She was given a lesson... So we had valid reason to believe She will not. But one never knows... Moreover, somebody could just feel like entering IB because of... Well... Fruits? Alien Stecks? Anything really, including updating Astro Pad could be a reason. Well... We had 99% chance that such thing would not happen, but we all know that those 1% are VERY scary ^^</p><p>Bigger and more resonable problem was actually simple fact that we were not sure WHEN we will go for another expo... And Hua could not go because of many reasons... Like being offline... Or not wanting to go... Or having to deal with hunters insted... So that plan was left alone to just sit there and wait if diffrent opportunity would not showed up earlier...</p><p><strong>Operation "Speech"</strong><br>Another interesting plan that we had was to make speech for crew. Humans should be getting lower on morale - remember that we orchestrated Oxygene crisis and so we forced Humans to abandon 6 Morale Rebel Base... And luckily we did controlled two other only morale sources on this ship... Jin Su and Andie (not including Doing The Thing and bananas, which were not at great amounts YET)... So why not call everybody to Central Corridor for a speech? We could tell them that it is protected by MycoAlarms, while in fact we knew that place was NOT protected. We were sure of it. Each of us already had prepared spores, apart of me... But with <em>Fertile</em> that wasn't a problem for me at all.</p><p>But there was this problem - what if Hua will come in and search immidetly? She would become infected of course in matter of few seconds from moment She enters room with us... But She could manage to scream about us being mushes, about speech being a trap... In short - this was risky. Risk of being exposed when we do not want to get exposed at all...</p><p>This whole plan was based on believe that it was so obvious Mush Trap that nobody would have thought it was actually Mush trap... Still, most of the mushes were relucant to take that risk... And while in middle of disscusing it, we were actually given WONDERFULL present by Roland... Present that was just what we needed - an excuse to make Hua come out of Her castle...</p><p><strong>Operation "Kill Roland THE Mush"</strong><br>So... What did Roland done? I will tell You... Though I don't remember it exacly... But it was like this more or less... He woke up (He was BDorm resident) and went to Bravo Bay. Than He went straight to Rear Corridor and from there He visited Alpha Bay 2 and Alpha Bay and went into Central Corridor. He entered Medlab and had Chit-Chat with Andie. By doing that He proved to NOT make anything Mushy... But Andie was Mush Herself... So we could tell her what to say, right? At the end He camed back to BDorm and showered himself... Only after some time He posted reason of being dirty - not when He got dirty but few minutes after showering... And it looked all so strange... Perfect bait!</p><p>Now many of You propably imagine how we would lie about Roland's actions and how we would made Hua kill Him, while we convert Her... Right? WRONG! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This is what we did...</p><p>I "camed online" and reported Roland behaving strangly... Hua was online, so She immidietly took a bait and started to ask about it... So I told that He woke up and went to BBay... And than he returned few minutes later and used soap without reportig getting dirty... Than I stalked Him for Hua and reported Him entering to every single Bay... It looked as if He would just put spores as trapper everywhere. It honestly looked like that. Only person who could save Him from Hua's wrath would be now Andie calling out "He confessed to me! Nothing Mushy!". But that wasn't just going to happen right now...</p><p>Hua got really blodthirsty and wanted to kill somebody... Roland or me - whether I was telling the truth or not. Well... I was telling the truth about Roland's movement pattern. I still do not get it why? But He moved like that. Strange <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So we formed with Hua plan... She (as <em>Shooter</em> from <em>MageBook</em>) will bring into Rear Corridor knife and two lenses... I was holding all this time Blaster. Our plan was that I will give her Blaster, She will move into BDorm and put 3 bullets into Roland hoping to finish him off with that. If that would failed, I would use all my AP to knife Him to death. Should that failed also, Hua would finished up with knife as well...</p><p>It didn't took long, as Hua agreed to it. And... Boom!</p><p>- Hua enters Rear Corridor from Alpha Dorm<br>- Hua dropped knife<br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> Eleesha spikes Hua<br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> Eleesha spikes Hua<br>-Jin Su enters room from Bravo Dorm<br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> Jin Su spikes Hua<br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">Hua converted<img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And in that moment Hua takes Anonymush as well...</p><p>Nobody noticed anything once more... But we had problem, right? We just plotted killing Roland for being Mush, in "Human Channel". What we will do now? Tell them that we changed our minds? We could not. We were after all determined to kill Him, right? And here Andie suddenly comes online and call us to stop! She now reveals that He Chit-Chatted with her and that there was no Mushy Actions taking place. Jin Su gave us "pep talk" how it is wrong to kill somebody without checking everything first and that if I would investigate Him further I could actually see Him chatting with Andie and all that commotion would not happen. We told how we are paranoid since it is like D6 or 7 and still we have two mushes with us... And all things passed somehow...</p><p><strong>Little Explanation</strong><br>Just in case You think that Andie really just camed online when we were just about to kill Roland - no. She didn't. She was online all the time, having good laughts and just waiting for moment to "come online". It was all planed - controling and releasing information was handled by us here. Andie perfectly knew what Her role was and what to do.</p><p>Also you might wonder how it happened that Jin Su had spore ready... Do You remember that expo with Raluca? There was crystal planet... Derek, Jin Su and Raluca got hit by Spores. So Mush team earned 3 spores at that expo - 2 for us to use (Derek and Jin Su) and 1 on Raluca... But that one... We will talk about that one later, when we will talk about Raluca.</p><p><strong><em>To be continued... Tommorow? ^^</em></strong></p>

                <p>I just want to add here, for a while we were worried Hua was not going to take the bait. That when we suggested RC for the blaster swap, she was going to say "Just come to AD". After all, standing in RC with another character is hella dangerous. There was a question earlier about the Mycos. I had dropped one in FC, Eleesha had - I think - dropped one in the Refectory. I had asked her to while I was still human, anyway, and it disappeared so...</p><p>Finally, there were two mycos left in the Lab. That only left 1 unaccounted for. Honestly, we never really even considered the mycos. I'm not sure anyone actually moved them. Hua never went up there and Ian never left. Nobody else was the initiative taking kind and we never mentioned them. After all, we had 7 bloody cameras, where were we going to put them?</p><p>Oh, but back to Hua. Eleesha was standing in RC at the time as they discussed killing Roland [having just followed Roland far enough to see him running around, but not far enough to see him visiting Andie]. Imagine our surprise when Hua suggested we do the blaster swap in RC. And the most classic, her last words as a human in the Human Channel, right before she stepped outside...<br>"No mushy business okay...?"<br>Boom boom convert.

                <p>I actually noticed strange logs in RC, as I went through just a while after that. Eleesha standing there, Hua coming in, then JS, then some left, some not. Hua dropped and picked up the knife.... it looked like Hua was attacking eleesha, not the other way round, but hua was proven human, so it must've been some strange mush hunting plan going on. <br>And since I didn't have time to think about it....well I just forgot about that. But anyway there was nothing I could have done with 5 mush against me, just sped up the end of ship.</p>

                <p>That Jin Su popping should have been a dead give away. Whenever you see 3 people in a non-camera'd location where one isn't Chun... that's a conversion. But you are right. We could have taken the ship by force at that point. Hua was the sixth mush and we had all the weapons.</p>

                <p>Yeah, I know this feeling. When all the weapon and strong people are on Mush side, nothing will kill them. You can get dirty with bad excuse, be lazy at work, do nothing productive for cycles, and human won't make any single punch to you because no organisation between true human, no one alone can kill you without weapon, you know, they need some sore proof in the logs that represents Mush action, or confess yourself in chat some lie, easily to be detected (not this one that you can keep talking everyday) - nothing else.</p>

                <p>And... Time for another chapter of my story! Well... Ehh... Telling the truth there is not much left really to tell... You see... As our numbers growed, we could start to convert humans faster and didn't had to worry about many things... We pretty much needed to worry only about extracting in front of cameras and such...</p><p>Now, there is also another problem - I have no idea which conversion happened next! Honestly! Was it Raluca? Or was it Terrence and Kuan Ti? Yes! Those two were converted at same time... Terrence bit earlier, Kuan Ti bit later - but same cycle.</p><p>And who was converted after that? I also don't remember... When Mushes grew stronger, I started to be less and less active. Victory was assured and rest was just a formality. So I entered into routing - extract two spores at morning while using my IT Points, go back to BDorm and stealth shower, take Medkit and selfheal. Coppy and repeat next day.</p><p>So what can I tell You about? How about this? <em>Chronology is no longer in place!</em> I will just describe some more important events and conversions - but I will not care about chronology anymore. Allright? I knew You will agree <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> Not agree? Your problem! Ha! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Let's talk... STEPHEN!</strong><br>So... Stephen... That guy was my personal nightmare since begining of ship. Firstly, He apprenticed Paranoid and made this ship carry 7 cameras... Then he killed Janice out of sudden with no disscusion and no warnings... Yet He had valid reasons to do so - this proved Him to be rather good player in terms of knowing game mechanicks, but totally uncontrollable via social ways... And here He was still alive. Sometimes inactive, sometimes comming back...</p><p>Honestly? As mushes were more and more numerous I was more and more affraid of this guy. Worried that He will just kill one of us for some reason... That guy was enigma for us. Having Him around was like having Your child playing with loaded gun... That needed to be changed!</p><p>And changed it was... One, beautifull day Stephen decided to enter Bravo Dorm. And ther He was idling. Luckily we had also Hua being dirty from eating ration or something... Maybe from repairing Oxygen Tank? No matter - She was dirty and had reason to enter BDorm... So we made decision that I will take off camera, than Jin Su, I and Hua will just spike Stephen at BDorm. Easy? Very <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Things became even easier when Andie camed online - She was Fertile so could get free spore. So why not use Her insted of Hua? Hua could do some hunter shooting later on when needed...</p><p>So at right time, when all 3 of us were active I just woke up, took out camera from BDorm, steeped out into RC, extracted spore (this paticular day I had no spores extracted at morning) and went back to BDorm to finish off Stephen's conversion. Jin Su and Andie extracted spores somewhere in BBay and in CBT? I don't know... Stephen converted and all is well...</p><p>Not really... Jin Su extracted spore exacly when Andie entered Bravo Bay <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> We were disscusing what to do with this problem... And guess what? There was VERY STRONG "Fuck it! Humans will not be able to do a thing to us anyway" notion <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But eventually we just asked Hua to perform Bravo Bay Defacing.</p><p>It was good decision! Like next cycle Gioele entered BDorm for some reason... And He didn't noticed Defacer in BBay (lack of previous logs) and me taking out camera in Bravo Dorm... Direct Spore Extraction He would surely noticed! I can't believe otherwise! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>When Stephen camed online He could not believe that we managed to do all that with 7 cameras on board! But in same time He said to me in private that when D6 camed and no mush dead still, He kind of suspected that whole ship is being taken over secretly, so He is amazed but not surprised.</p><p><strong>Let's talk Terrence and Kuan Ti...</strong><br>There was little interaction betwen me and Kuan Ti. I honestly don't remember his skills, beside that He was an Astro. Maybe Designer also? Or maybe Tech? I don't remember... He was active, competent and did His work.</p><p>Terrence was also active, had great skills and was, in addition to helping ship - He was also trying to start His own Mush Hunt. And He saw me. He saw me being mush.. But too late... Andie was also mush by that time so She kept me covered. Moreover I never put my spore on Him, despite Him giving me plenty of occasions to do so. Like... 3 or four times we were walking together to the top of ship, talking about Mushes and our situation... And never ever he got even 1 spore from me. So everytime he checked His MScanner, He was the same 0 there <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>During our last walk to Lab I decided to make some confesion to Terrence... ^^</p><p>I know how it sounds... No, not THIS type of confesion <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Not "I am Mush!" confesion. Diffrent one <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> You see... I knew perfectly that Terrence had His doupts about me and that he was asking Andie some questions. Andie calmed Him down when it camed to my person, but I felt like that "trust" may quickly melt as days were passing and two mushes were still roarming ship freely. So... Obvious question that I could have been asked by Terrence sooner or later was "What have You found Eleesha? You clearly were collecting logs around ship and You MUST just found something! Right? RIGHT?!"</p><p>That was question I was affraid and so I choose to confess to Terrence that I am not really good Mush Hunter... That I choose Eleesha only because I like Her skillset that is very good for ship support (IT + TECH + POLYMATH) and for helping in Projects and Research... All that seemed to work greatly <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Fact that it was VERY CLOSE to truth is another thing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>That was our last conversation before Terrence got converted into Mush...</p><p>How did that happened? Very easily! We saw them both to be in Nexus... So when 5 of us were active and we had together 6 spores ready (2 for me, and 1 for everybody else) we just moved into Nexus, Hua defaced it and we extracted spores and infected them both - first Terrence and after that Kuan Ti. Paola and another mush took Anonymush and all was fine.</p><p>Of course there was also little bit of troubles comming our ways - Raluca just began Her random walks and She just went through Rear Corridor while we had "meeting" in Nexus...</p><p>So... Why She haven't noticed? Why didn't reacted? I can only guess why... You see... Jin Su declared that he will make speech at Alpha Dorm... So I can only assume She was getting to ADorm and thought that our meeting in Nexus was more like "Let's all give one relay on project since we are already here..." What is more She propably saw logs of Hua getting in there and Andie, so might think that if anything bad would be happening, those two would let everybody else know... ^^</p><p>But that is just what I do think. What was real reason? I have no idea... Mayb I was right? Or maybe not? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Only Raluca knows answer to this one ^^</p><p><strong><em>To be continued... Tommorow of course! ^^</em></strong></p>

                <p>And it is time to finish my AP... It has been long eoungh if You ask me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>To be perfectly honest I have only one more conversion to describe - Raluca. I don't really remember Frieda's conversion and I was not taking part in Roland and Ian's conversions. And that means I will not be describing them for sure... So... We will go on with Raluca... And after that I will write few words about our Gioele and why I have decided on such title for AP and not another one... So...</p><p><strong>Converting Ralulu will be easy...</strong><br>Do You still remember that one expo on which we hoped to actually convert Hua, but we failed to do so thanks to Raluca comming into IB and staying there? Well... There was Crystal Zone on that planet and actually, it was a Mush Trap. So Jin Su and Andie got 1 free spore... While Raluca got infected with one... Problem with converting Her fully was that She was either in Monitored room OR there was more important and dangerous human to be converted at the moment. So Raluca was always delayed with conversion. If You add to this fact that She was not speacking almost anything in public, You might know why She was considered low priority target most of time...</p><p>And to be honest She would not get converted if not for precious opportunity to do so AND for the fact that She was walking around all the time and could interfere with our plans... So we needed to get rid of that obstacle. Moreover if we would infect Her and killed after that, we could fool humans to believe we are mush free. Technicly at lest... Practically we would have to make them believe that there also was transfer occuring since Raluca got comfirmed human - illnes made her vomit in every room she visited.</p><p>But why not just infect everybody and go Sol? Ship was in good condition and we could try for Eden. And we did tried our best there... That was a reason why we could want to make humans believe to be Mush Free.</p><p>Ah! I digress... Raluca... Raluca... So, Raluca was standing alone in Central Corridor. It was so easy... All I needed to do is to go into RAT to extinguish fire and cross CC with Raluca there... And infect Her twice! After all She was already spored once. So I do it - I go into BBay, I extract two spores and go to infect Ralulu...</p><p>And here comes surprise! Raluca actually DID got rid of that spore while She visited Lab. So... So it changed nothing - I procceded as planed and Hua found reason why She could visit CC and finished off infection. Or was it Andie? No matter - somebody did it! And so we got Raluca who happened to be LVL 16 mush! If I could infect Her much, MUCH earlier, than all those conversion would go so easier! Also, in Mush Channel, Ralulu actually happened to be VERY communicative. Oh well... I still like how this ship happened to go <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> No regreats here! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Robo Drone Gioele!</strong><br>Gioele was rather silent guy. We called Him in our Mush Channel "Robo Drone Gioele" or just "Drone Gioele because He was in many aspect funcioned exacly as Drones are. Moving around and doing good stuff for ship. He was PERFECTLY NEUTRAL player if You ask me... He never did anything against any of teams (apart of choosing Paranoid and installing cameras at game start!). Insted He worked for benefit of Ship as whole! Repearing stuff and shooting hunters from turrets. That is what Gioele was doing most of time. Nothing fancy, nothing great... But still very usefull and helpfull... Especially since He was lucky! He actually managed to kill few hunters from turrets, He was extinguishing fires and such... In short - Robo Drone Gioele at His best! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>He was so nice even to not notice Bravo Bay being defaced cycle ago! Though in that case medal should be awarded to Roland who didn't noticed ME taking off camera in BDorm DESPITE looking through logs with purpose of finding person who took out that camera! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Ehh... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Bravo Roland. "Good Job" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Though it would not change anything really <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As for Gioele - He died from lack of morale. He never attended to Speeches despite those being announced by Jin Su. He never ate bananas when low on morale, while some of us (Roland for example) were eating 3 of them to help their morale. Finnaly... You can all see His last words, right? I don't think there is any more need for me to comment on Gioele. Not worth it.</p><p><strong>Why "Human Zoo"?</strong><br>When Mush Victory was assured... We aimed for as good way to win as possible. Converting everobyd and returning Sol was great ending. One that I loved to achieve... BUT! But converting Eden would be much better. And we did tried! We did tried to get that actually. In our effort to do that, we left some members of crew uninfected... Ian, Roland, Frieda and Gioele were ment to remain humans. Roland as pilot would need more AP to do his job better - as human He could gain those from eating. Frieda - the same story, but insted of piloting, She would scann planets... Ian was harmless and keeping him human was no harm to us. And Gioele was acting like drone - so no need to change that. Those four... They were ment to be our "Human Zoo" which we would take care off ^^</p><p>As You can see things didn't went as we planned and we had to turn ship to Sol. But that... That is a story to be told by our Commander Jin Su - my Right Hand! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong><em>THE END... From mine point of view! ^^</em></strong></p>

                <p>It is true, my Great Queen Elemele was sadly unavailable for the last hours of our glorious ship and the task fell to me to make the final, difficult decisions. Like taking us home. Which I will explain later <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But for now, Frieda's conversion. You see, Frieda confided in Andie (via private channel, not chitchat) that she was actually gold and could pick IT Expert. That she just hadn't to avoid raising suspicion. We realized that what little we gained via her being able to eat, we lost again via her paranoia and her not picking the skill.</p><p>Gioele went to stand on the bridge for some unknown reason and this freaked Frieda out (she had already been suspecting Paola for the longest time). She refused to stay on the bridge and use the sofa, benefiting both from the bonus AP and Paola's logistics. Instead she ran back to AD. I can't remember where exactly we infected her, I think I was not personally involved, but it was the easiest thing to pick her up as well. Suddenly she had no issues about standing on the bridge with our little Paobao and the useful little Gioele Drone <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Yeah... You got me when you invited me to Bdorm. I kind of felt it a long way coming, but... if my suspicions were right, then I would be facing a large amount of mushes (to the point that the best I could hope for was to be bait, see them make a single move and run away screaming if I clicked refresh faster)... Gioele freaked me out so much by acting like such a mush &gt;_&lt;. Why corner someone when they're already forced to be with someone suspicious lika Paola? you make it look like you are prepping a 2-man infect rush, or murder... And staying, despite us telling him not to? :S<br>I'm surprised I didn't try to go for blood, but I had long since decided to not go for murders, no point in starting just because he was being scary :S.</p>

                <p>Almost forgot, I still need to put a cherry on this AP. All that's left to say is why we went back to Sol!</p><p>Day 12 arrived and we had gotten no starmaps. Despite scanning for a few days before that, we didn't even find Cristillite planets. Then I spoke to a friend who told me that when they were keeping a human alive for a mush Eden, they were giving them 6 hugs a day already by day 9 to stave off panic attacks. We had no shrink! True, our humans were blissfully unaware and were happily munching bananas by the bucketload and were regularly chitchatting to Andie, but all it took was an unlucky set of 2 or 3 panic attacks to fall on one of our 2 humans while they were offline and they would be gone!</p><p>Then all panic attacks would land on our remaining human and the only way to keep them alive would be to continuously speech them. And at 1AP for 1 morale it was not really an efficient trade. To make matters worse, any excess effort we took to conserve their morale would make it clear that the ship had been conquered by the mush.</p><p>If we had been on 2 starmaps - or even 1 starmap - I would have considered making a plan. We reveal ourselves and lock them up. Force them to stay alive via morale speeches. Something. But since we were at 0 fragments, it would take at least 3 days to collect all the starmaps. 3 days of not making them suspicious or keeping them alive despite their best efforts.</p><p>I contacted both remaining humans via private channels, asking their morale. Neither responded. At that point, I realized that if they were inactive, even a little, they could die at any moment. We had no way to track their morale. It was highly unlikely we were going to reach Eden at this point and keeping them alive would really be a pain in the ass. After a quick discussion with the online mushes, we agreed that going home made sense.</p><p>Unfortunately, our Great Queen Eleesha (Europa) was not active at the time so I had to make the call in her absence. She agreed with me that it was an acceptable decision.</p><p>So we fixed Pilgred, reported every mush that had extracted spores in public chat, converted our last 2 humans (they never came online again) and went home.</p><p>The End.</p>

                <p>Yay! Stories are over so I don't have to worry to spoil anything. And I also have time to write something, finally.</p><p>I was Hua <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hua.png" alt=":mush_hua_50:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And although it always feels like a loss to be converted (or cured, respectively), this time it wasn't so bad. Eleesha's plan was sound and well executed so I don't feel so ashamed for falling for her ploy, and after all, most active people were in the mush chat, by that time, making being a mush rather enjoyable experience.<br>I just hope that the ship didn't become boring for the remaining humans, after day 7 or so. By that time, most of decision making and ship's situation discussing was done in mush channel and both public chat and "confirmed humans channel" started to stagnate little bit. I'd really like to hear from those last humans what they thought about the fact, that gradually most of the things weren't very much discussed and just started to happen more or lees out of the blue.</p><p>All in all, it was a great journey with only two very small details I'm still tiny little bit salty about:</p><p>1) I was holding knife for like whole ship and I NEVER EVER got to stab anyone with it! Come on, guys! I was looking forward to using it a lot! You can't have a sexy shoeless god of war on the board and expect him to never stab anyone. That's just inconsiderate and cruel! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>2) I said "no mushy tricks." And even then there WERE mushy tricks. Europa, I thought we were friends! How can I ever trust you, after this?! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"></p>
