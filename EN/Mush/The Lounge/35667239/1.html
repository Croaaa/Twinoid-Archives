                <p>Kuan-Ti, savior of oxygen tanks sabotaged by mush here. <br>Ok, so <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2420">Here's </a>our ship. After waking up, I held off a bit on choosing a skill, due to the fact that I had never been Kuan-Ti before, but eventually settled on astrophysicist. <br>While we were messing around in space, what with people taking Gioele's coffee, and me being not very good at getting Neron projects done, we kept catching Ian dirty, despite the fact that all the plants were in the lab with the apron, in addition to not giving conclusive reports and sometimes no reporting at all. We eventually quarantined him to the lab to prevent him from doing anything shifty. More derping around, and I noticed that, despite the fact that we had oxygenated ducts, and it had activated last cycle, we had still lost oxygen. I realized that we had a sabotaged o2 tank, and went off to fix it and check the logs. Eleesha and Chao had been the last two in the room, so I fixed the tank and told Chun and Gioele, as he had seemed to be pretty human, and possibly had at least one spore on him. At this point I wasn't quite sure who it was due to the fact that Eleesha had, in a brief moment when piloting locks were off, grabbed the Pasiphae, retrieved one piece of plastic scrap, and then dropped it in the rear corridor randomly. At one point Gioele had picked up a fire extinguisher from there, so I figured he should know about his possible sporing. We were eventually forced to let Eleesha in on it when she noticed that Gioele had grabbed a knife for some reason. Chun politely told her in a PM, resulting in her roughly saying, in the main chat, <br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Eleesha</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"> ATTENTION CHAO IS MUSH KNIFE IS IN REAR BRAVO STORAGE GO GO GO</span></span><br>Upon hearing this, Chao hid behind Ian. Who we politely asked to move. And so he did. Gioele made short work of him.<br>Later,m when we were low on oxygen, in between stuffing my face to gather the AP needed for planet scanning, I noticed that we had again lost too much oxygen, and again there were things broken that should not have been. And again, Eleesha was one of the two people in there.<br>The other was Ian, much to everyone's groaning. Chun reported it in the main chat, sending everyone after him. Evidently, he took pity on us and suicided via shower.<br>we soon travelled to a planet Jin Su had found, with sweet, sweet oxygen and horrible, horrible earthquakes. We had to explore it out of necessity, but surprising enough, nothing happened. Well, we got plenty of oxygen, and Hua got a rash from some spider, but oddly enough, that was it.<br>Raluca eventually fixed Pilgred, much to Gioele's joy, and the serum was done soon after. although our crew had no inactives, our armor was getting low, and we had few Neron projects completed, so we returned to Sol... or we tried. Some shenanigans later, and I used the hacker kit to return.<br>Well, that's it from my side. Feel free to discuss idly about these events, and add your own side.</p>

                <p>Replying as I promised - I was Finola. I had a strong feeling Ian was Mush given how he attributed nothing to research and kept getting dirty from plants. I really thought we were doomed for awhile; our ship had next to no Neron upgrades, I felt like I was the only one doing anything really research wise, we were doing no expeditions (until we were down to almost no O2), and it seemed our pilots weren't handling the hunters well.</p><p>I'm surprised we were all able to turn that around - I knew Ian was Mush but had no clue Chao was the other until I logged on and saw him dead. We all came together in the end though with getting O2, finishing the Serum, finishing Pilgred and getting back Home. I really expected us to be spacedust so color me impressed.</p><p>Wish I had more to add but I seriously just dedicated everything towards research. Glad we made it back home in the end, good game folks. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Yeah again, I'm sorry about the projects...<br>I think the most remarkable thing was that we had a 100% activity rating, and nobody except for the Mush died. That doesn't happen very often, I think... and kudos to Jin Su and Janice, who tirelessly went around helping everyone with morale problems! I've added several of you to my contacts for when castings come out.</p>
