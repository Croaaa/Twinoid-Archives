                <p>My last ship had died and yet again I was at that character select screen. I had 2 choices: Jin Su or Stephen. I though <em>Hey, why not, lets be Jin Su for once</em>, and so I did. I hadn't been Jin Su in a while to be honest, but I was up for the challenge.</p><p><strong>Phase one: PreMush/PostMush selection</strong><br>And my first duty as the most amazing and important commander: Calm down Frieda and Gioele. Boy those pair were bickering at eachother about, I quote:<br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Frieda</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules</span></span><br>By the time I was in contact with a Mod (ily spaz) the whole ship was covered in text, all of Frieda yelling her distain for the rules of neutral play. (Aparently around 600 messages?) We eventually shut her up with duct tape and shortly after was murdered by NERON (quarantine).</p><p>During all this, the Mush were selected, D2C4?, and whadya know, I was selected. A bit earlier I had had a chat with Hua who was still fairly new to the game and offered my help, but if she was Mush to talk to Impet for assistance... Well, along came Mush selection and we were partners. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> But then Hua made a critical mistake: She took annonymush. I was kinda face-palming for a minute there but it caused enough panic that Gioele murdered the poor innocent Stephen (who was actually on his first ship, the poor guy). Raluca also accused me of sporing her and I volunteered myself to be tortured by Chao for confirmations sake. I lay my head to rest, hoping I would be fine, I mean I would be, I hadn't done anything suspicious in the slightest.</p><p>D2C8, Hua was nowhere to be heard, but I had a plan regardless. I re-activated Gold mode <span class="tid_strike">(because all mush do that according to patryk <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> )</span> and took the skills: Fertile, Infector and Splash Proof. In Alpha Dorm with me were Hua, standing Chao and myself. I knew what I needed to do.</p><div class="tid_sideNote"><em>My first Beta Mush.</em><br>Current AP: 10<br>Mission -1 (9AP)<br>Camera -1 (8AP)<br>extract 2 spores -2 (6AP)<br>infect Chao x2 -2 (4AP)<br>take off -2 (2AP)<br>fire shooter points before/after cycle change (6 shots)<br>+1 cycle change (3AP)<br>land -2 (1AP)<br>extract/infect -1 (0AP)<br>take annonymush</div><p>And just like that, all by myself I had our first beta. I also killed 3 (or was it 4?) hunters, and left one with 1hp, so I wouldn't look suspicious. When Hua came online a bit later she was all wow-ing and surprised and curious as to how I had managed to convert somebody by myself. Infector for the win. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> So the next cycle I re-installed the camera, picked up/dropped a bunch of items to flood the logs a bit and went along with my normal commanding business.</p><br><p><strong>Stage two: Freaky-deaky refreshes at 5 second intervals</strong><br>I lay in Alpha Dorm, exhausted and afraid.<br><em>Janice has entered the room.</em><br>Would she notice the logs? I shivered and prayed she wouldn't. Not a word from anyone so I just assumed she didn't. Terrence came (and left?) shortly after, and still nothing. I put on my shades <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"> and assumed they hadn't read the logs. Looking at when Chao last tortured me, I figured he'd be online around C5ish, but I wasn't too certain. This is right in the middle of when I'm supposed to be asleep, and it was also around when Hua was supposed to be online too. I shrugged, grabbed my pretend coffee (yeah I don't drink that stuff) and waited for them to be online. Janice was in the room with 3 mushrooms, all able to spike with one spore, what could possibly go wrong?<br>Well. Everything.<br>He was on sporadically, and I really needed to sleep. I ordered Hua to take down the camera, extract spores and we'd all infect him once and let Chao take annonymush, while I slept. So, down goes the cam, in goes 2 spores and Hua was to wait for Chao to put the last spore in and take annonymush and reinstall the camera... Well.<br>I'm not sure what Chao was on about, but he insta-picked trapper, presumably extracted a spore and trapped RC. He also tortured me too! (He only ever seemed to torture once, not sure why.) He said he faked my logs and posted it in the chat, with me lying down 3 times. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> I was fast asleep and pretty much didn't hear from Chao again..<br>Cycle change came, I opened a PM with Janice and asked if she needed Morale, she said yes and that was my queue to jab her with the last spore. She was online to message me, she should still be online to take annonymush, right?<br>7 hours. 7 hours with that little yellow man right up there all shroomy. Of course, being me I refreshed like crazy, crying a little bit inside hoping that nobody noticed. Terrence came online, tinkered with drones, Raluca came online, worked on a bit of Pilgred but nobody said anything. I wasn't sure if there were people in another chat scheming away trying to figure out who the Mush were or whether they just hadn't noticed. Eventually Janice came along and took annonymush, there was a bit of confusion and Raluca claimed she had seen 2 mushes on the bar but everyone else disagreed with her. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/keepcool.png" alt=":K" class="tid_ico"> Got away with another conversion scott free. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/keepcool.png" alt=":K" class="tid_ico"></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">More to come shortly!

                <p><strong>Stage 3: Expo-lishious!</strong></p><p>We had a planet to expo, but the mushrooms weren't planning on doing anything there, although I did force Raluca to move the camera to IB and Kuan Ti to guard FC. Raluca, Ian and myself departed on the expo, and thankfully there were no illness events. Somehow both Ian and Raluca managed to get lost (so glad I had the compass) but I found them both alive again, so it was no big deal. Raluca suspected there was a traitor but everyone just shrugged at the idea. Roland went and launched the expo a second time while there was only 1 zone left, and we ended up fighting a predator. Raluca seemed pretty angry about it but he was non-talkative so we didn't really know what he was thinking.</p><p>Cycle 8 I went up, watered the plants and just idled around a bit waiting for my mush partners to come around.</p><p><strong>Stage 4: More bang for your spores</strong></p><p>I'm kinda glad Ian was the only one researching (Terrence helped a bit I supposed..) Made my job a thousand times easier. The next day and a bit the mushrooms basically spent trying to coordinate what times we were online and able to do things. We had enough spores/people do do another round of infecting, preferably Gioele because he seemed the most dangerous. Janice grabbed two spores but didn't end up using them for that day at least. D5C2 (I think) was when Hua and I decided to go for Raluca. Gioele was a bit too far away and the room logs would easily be checkable, whereas Raluca was isolated, and even though she had a camera we've dealt with those before. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> And Raluca would be online earlier than Gioele, so we want to reduce the number of people that see it.</p><p>I had family over at the time, but managed to get a break and we made our move. We were literally in sync going through the rooms. AD&gt;RC&gt;RAS&gt;ER. Hua took down the camera, hid her cooked ration (I don't even know why) then put in her 1 spore. I shoved in my 2 spores and another Mush, and quickly retreated back to the dorm. Hua took a minute though, as she was forced to flood the room logs because of that damn ration. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But this time, we didn't get away with it...</p><br><p><strong>Stage 5: Mush-(con)fusion</strong><br>I came back a bit later, with a few sad things.<br><span class="tid_sideNote"><em>Hua is dead. Cause: Assasinated.</em><br><em>You are now the pariah!</em></span></p><p>I cried a little. My poor little alpha buddy was dead. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> But, we had the prize. Raluca took annonymush (I don't know if anyone noticed that one) and we began plotting. Chao even came online, mutated and splattered Gioeles brains out. Quite lucky there, if he was still alive when we did our plan he might've known something was up, and I would've been stuck with my pariah status.</p><p><em>The plan</em><br>We didn't have an active Eleesha and she had been sold, so we were fine in that department. Raluca was to genius the cure and 'pretend' to inject me, while I, as Terrence put it, I;<br><strong>"Went coco for cocoa-puffs."</strong><br>The humans had a similar idea, but instead of Raluca 'injecting' me, it was to be Janice. Good for me that she was a beta too! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Terrence managed to murder Chao and I insulted him and called him a "0 legged monster", I insulted the humans a little and soon enough I was 'human' again. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><em>Jin Su curls up into a ball as the injecty thing comes close. "NO!" he screamed, but Janice didn't care. It was like being stabbed with a rusty blade, slowly slicing, slowly destroying. There was nothing he could do. He vomited some pink gunk and slowly the normal Jin Su opened his eyes.</em></span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Now does anybody know about the Outcast stuff, does that go away or am I stuck with it <em>foreeeverrr?</em></span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Goes away after cycle change it seems.<br><em>Your victimizer is dead, you are no longer the Pariah.</em></span></span></p><p><strong>Stage 6: 'mush free'</strong></p><p>Of course, my little betas and I were still plotting. I wanted to avoid anyone other than Janice and Raluca enter the engine room incase the room logs were read but honestly I don't think anyone checked room logs on this ship.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> Things moved along smoothly, I shot a few hunters and everyone just continued their regime thinking they were mush free. Soon all the cameras fell and we were free to do what we did best.</p><p>I wanted Janice and Raluca to spike Kuan Ti and Paola once before daychange and once after, then once PILGRED was done, I'd spike them both and hit the button. Unfortunately Janice wasn't around at daychange so we only had Paola with double spores from Raluca. We were seriously considering converting her then making her sleep with Kuan Ti and put one spore so he'd have 2 and we'd go to Sol after, but PILGRED wasn't done and this was Paolas first ship on English Mush (said they were from French(?) mush) so she wouldn't have been able to annonymush. I had opened a chat with her to make sure she didn't do the thing with Kuan Ti, so I had to make something up for me to have a reason not to. <br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">(Just pretend I'm standing on the bridge when I say this)<br>Ladies and gentlemen of the crew, it is an honor to be here to join these two lovely people together in friendship and in love, Paola Rinaldo and Lai Kuan Ti. While we may have been off to a rocky start, their friendship has blossomed beyond imaginable levels, and its truly been inspirational to see it so. Although they're far from the point of getting married I do have to say I wish them both the best in their lives, for better or for worse. You may now do the thing. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></span></span></p><p>They were moved yes, and I was just glad I didn't make a massive mistake. Paola even said she wanted <em>11!</em> boys. She somehow even managed to get Plasma shield from Comms...</p><p>So, we bided our time, and Kuan Ti even got a little bit suspicious.</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Kuan Ti</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Are we sure there aren't any mush around? 'cause Raluca went sleeping in the same dorm as me, without any track of Janice in the area for 2-3 cycles now. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"></span></span></p><p>Well, Janice spiked Kuan Ti once, I spiked him a second time and readied myself for daychange. Of course I pretended to do human things, Roland shot 4 hunters So I pretended that I had. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> With the acknowledgement from my betas the plan went ahead. Kuan Ti was infected with his last spore, as was Paola, I made my little speech and away we went to Sol.<br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Pitiful humans.. You really thought you eliminated us hey? Well, take a look around. Not many of you humans left now, am I right? We're going to head home now. That pitiful cure? That'll be destroyed, along with that single other piece of research you did into our sexual reproduction. Soon you will all know the true serenity of the Mush hive mind! Fret not, its not painful, its beautiful. The last step in human evolution.<br>Thanks for the trip guys, you should be more careful next time! I'll make an AP thread: [AP] The Mush conspiracy. </span></span></p><p>And you know what the greatest thing of this voyage was?<br><em><strong>I GOT THE TOP GLORY SPOT!!</strong></em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>I single-handedly <em>completed</em> the conversions of every single mush on board. <br>To my mushrooms:</p><p>Hua, Alpha Partner; you were a wonderful partner, you did your best and thats what counts. I really hope you can come to the AP thread!!!<br>Chao, Beta #1; You were a bit uncoordinated but you sure as hell made the right choices. Smart thinking mutating and killing Gioele!<br>Janice, Beta #2; You were awesome! Also nice one jabbing Roland(?) with the cure. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"><br>Raluca, Beta #3; The only reason I'm not a nice smelling human right now. Glad to have had you on board with my mushy plans!<br>Kuan Ti, Beta #4; You might've been my #2 in the chain of command, but you're my #4 when it comes to shroomyness. FEEL THE CONFUSION!<br>Paola, Beta #5; You now love me and me alone. You will be my queen!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And thank you to the humans too! <br>Ian and Terrence, in the future its probably better to work on only 1 research at a time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> <br>Roland, I don't even know what you were up to half the time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"><br>Gioele, you were good, just not good enough. You gotta tell me who those 4 names were that you were thinking could be mush!<br>And Stephen. The poor newbie. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p><span class="tid_sideNote"><em>And in the end, the winner, for greatest commander of all time...
