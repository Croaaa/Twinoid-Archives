                <p>Hello, Ian. It was an interesting ship, even if I bumbled very, very badly our original plans to Iiinfesssst like proper gentlemushes.</p><br><p>I was Stephen. I picked him so I could play something of a generalist as I was going to be going to the cabin and net would be spotty. Sure enough I got mush though. This shouldn't have been a problem, as I would be mostly available throughout the weekend, but as it so happens, it was.</p><p>When Roland crept in on the day of the oxygen planet, I realized I could get some sporing done. Which was GREAT. Except the connection I had from the country was, exceptionally poor. And I would have to select anonymush pretty quickly since I knew there were at least a few people actively online and preparing for the expedition. So I spiked Roland and the reload stalled. Well crap crap crap. So in my panic I reload again and quickly choose my last skill.. ....Transfer. Wait. No, that's definitely not what I wanted to click on.</p><p>I beg Roland to still be refreshing and pick anonymush, but by the time he does, Gioele has already seen. With just me and roland in there so far, it wouldn't take a super Eleesha to gather where this most likely went down. Well, I'm boned.</p><p>So with Jin Su popping in, who was almost converted, and me dreaming of another mush trap to finish him off while we're at it to try to salvage something out of completely blowing it, I say go, launch. But of course, I'm in a panic, I don't quite remember that Janice had not arrived just yet. So off we go, onto the planet of death.</p><p>Jin Su dies, which is not ideal, and I am mortally wounded - down to 4 AP. I even get lost, and they have to find me - getting the o2 in the process. With hanging head, I go to bed certain that both me and our Roland convert are completely uncovered and hosed.</p><p>But somehow, when I woke up, I wasn't dead. Eleesha had been great throughout the game and Gioele pretty attentive, so I figured no matter how inactive the ship was, especially as hurt as I was, I was completely blown.</p><p>So having had enough time to recover, I decide to transfer Eleesha since I figure I couldn't have much more of a grace period until I was dead. I set off the myco alarm in rear corridor sporing and slipped into bravo before someone came and murdered me. Whoops. Well, as it turned out, I was just as much of an idiot the second time - I was so focused on living 'enough cycles' to have ap for the transfer, I didn't even think that it would be the same day. I'd already spiked Roland. Well done, Stephen.</p><p>I went to bed the second time, filthy from my sporing and certain I would surely be smothered by a pillow now. at least I had trapped the rc to give ian and roland something to work with, perhaps.</p><p>And then I woke up, still alive. With enough AP to carry out the aborted action from before. I transferred into Eleesha, feeling almost guilty at getting away with it after bumbling so completely. All I could do from there was spore up, put on the armour and twirl my mustache until the crew used me as a pinata and the oxygen counted down once more to 0.</p><br><p>No active techs. And it seemed our Terrence was a griefer given his end message. He knew full well what he was doing. Shame, shame.</p><p>But it was a pleasure playing with everyone here, and I cannot apologize enough to Ian for completely falling flat on my face multiple times.</p>
