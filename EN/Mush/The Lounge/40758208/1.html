                <p>Hi!</p><p>Recently that ship here ended: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5121" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5121</a></p><p>Roland here, I was on board of the successful ship and I have decided to open an Ap-thread since we did very fine.</p><p>We were able to return to sol with the cure at day 15 and looking at the circumstances that is an amazing achievement. Looking at the end page, you will see that Eleesha wrote we were a very determined crew. I want to show you that this statement is fully right.</p><p><strong>Part 1: The mush is showing himself</strong><br>On this ship we had a strong opponent: The mush Jin su. His original intention was probably to abandon lots of us at our first expedition. So he asserted that he had not enough energy and that he had to go off. He also asked us whether we could do our first expedition without him. <br>Luckily we didn't fall for it and waited until he has time to do the expedition.<br>Then he thought he could do a smart move (he told us later about his intention-we had later much time to talk with him). His plan was to start the expedition without the spacesuit and he thought that he wouldn't take part at the expedition without a spacesuit so he could abandon the expedition team. But of course not taking the spacesuit means only that he had to wait in the icarus until all the other people came back from expedition. After that fail he decided to take wrench and meditkit and took off with pasisphae. From there he teased us very much.</p><p><strong>Part 2: Begin of the struggle</strong><br>We didn't want to loose these items and we wanted to show the mush that this tactic will not work against us. So we decided to advance neron projects in the hope of magnetic net. Unfortunately Paola was very inactive, so we had to do all the projects via Nexus. After teslatron reservoir (I think) we had plasma shield as available project. At that point our improvements were slowed down very much. <br>We didn't want to be infected or murdered by Jin. Therefore we let Ian guard the Alpha bay 2, so Jin couldn't leave that room anymore. So he was locked up in the pasisphae.</p><p><strong>Part 3: Attack of the fellow</strong><br>Jin had time at the pasisphae and he used it to plot against us. We had the big problem that Janice was either already dead because of starvation or inactive at the bridge the whole time. Also Andie was far away from getting confidant. So we had already a morale problem. Jin recognized that problem and operated against us with the help of his fellow mush partner. That partner was Terrence, who was probably a newbie and did not much strange things so far to be suspected strongly. He was somehow cute, I remember that before mush selection we had some jokes about who is liking Paola and after that Terrence invited all men involved and said he loves her most and that we have to settle it. Now when I think about it his love to Paola seemed to vanish after mush selection. After selection he was very quiet - can be a psychological evidence I think ^^.<br>Anyway, Terrence mutated at one point and attacked Chun and... failed. He wasn't able to kill her. I think the reason is that Chun had the armor and the skill sneak, which makes it more difficult to attack her. Gioele and myself were able to finish him of right after the incident and we had to hear very much loud lamentations of Jin who was very unhappy about that fail ^^.</p><p><strong>Part 4: RNG is trolling us</strong><br>After some time we were able to get plasma shield and could continue quicker with neron projects. But magnetic net just wasn't showing up. Days passed and our oxygen got lower and lower as our morale, but we didn't want to give up yet. Since Jin was landing and probably infecting Ian at one point we exchanged Ian with Chun who had already shown how difficult it is to kill her. And we pushed our projects further. To be quicker we did sometimes even not very optimal but quick projects like anomaly detector and convenient sink. And at one point when oxygen was already very low we finally got the magnetic net as available project - it was one of the last three available projects <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Part 5: showdown in Alpha bay 2</strong> <br>Now besides oxygen our morale was already very low and we had already day 5. Paola came only shortly online to decode the rebel base of the previous day ( the blaster upgrade) which was useless until the end since we had an Andie with polyvalent. She didn't came online to decode the morale base, but we had already people with morale below 5. After warning her and waiting for 10 hours I killed her, so Eleesha was new comms officer and she decoded the morale base. Since at that time Raluca had enough xp for genius we actually also planned to finish the cure but one condition is the mush genome disk which wasn't decoded yet. When Eleesha decoded an xyloph database she lost the connection. Since we were running out of oxygen (maybe 5 o2 left) we decided to finish magnetic net, loading one fuel and killing Jin after moving. <br>Right after moving I went to alpha bay 2 and saw that Gioele managed to show up there even quicker than myself. In Alpha bay 2 Jin did already kick Chun and it seemed that he transferred into Gioele at the moment where Gioele entered the room. To our luck Gioele had almost no energy at that time. When I entered the room I saw only Jin attacking chun and fired with a blaster instantly at Jin (always missing) before I realized the transfer. Chun got at that time online too, she didn't realize the transfer that quickly so she did attack Jin quiete a few times before we could stop her. So human Jin (former Gioele) got a broken shoulder and a critical hemmorhage (fortunatly he was able to get rid of it after maybe a day). But in the end Chun finished our mushy Gioele (former Jin).</p><p><strong>Part 6: struggling to survive</strong><br>We had only 4-5 oxygen left at that point and finally we were out of orbit. Now all people with ap did their best to find a planet with oxygen. After some time we had luck and started an expedition to a planet with oxygen when we had only one unit of oxygen left at the daedalus. The expedition was successful and returned only around one minute before cycle change. After that time things got lots of easier and also more similar to usual ships with a good crew, we could finish pilgred, got the mush disk and the cure. We also did some expeditions which got us jumpkins, lots of steaks and some artefacts. So we managed to stay alive until around day 15. I think we had not enough astrophysicists so we were not able to find planets with high chances for starmap fragments and therefore we were also not able to get to Eden. After our main astrophysicist Frieda died because of a sheet of metal we decided to return to Sol at day 15, cycle 1.</p><p>It was a great voyage, thanks! I hope to see here also some other people of that amazing ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
