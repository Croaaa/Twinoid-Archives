                <p>It was D2C1 when I woke up as Finola <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/finola.png" alt=":mush_finola_50:" class="tid_ico">. The ship wasn’t full yet but it didn’t take long for everyone to wake up. With Frieda’s help, I started doing my job immediately and we had antispore gas ready in the blink of an eye. The other anti-mush research followed quickly, which was great for the humans but didn’t make the mush very happy.</p><p><strong>The missing extinguisher</strong><br>Since their sporing was very limited since an early time, I spent the first day fearing a rampage but nothing seemed to happen so I kept being dedicated to spending my time between the lab and medlab. Until the day we got a fire and no one seemed to know where it was. I went looking for it, grabbed the extinguisher in rear corridor (the one in front corridor was grabbed by Chao) and was able to put out the fire. All seemed good except that Chao decided to idle in the engine room with Raluca for one cycle or two. And when he came back to the dorms, suddenly the extinguisher he was holding was found hidden in rear corridor. It didn’t take long for him to be killed but he was found to be human. People assumed he was being some mild griefer and no one seemed to care about tracking his steps and check if it was indeed him hiding the extinguisher… <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Raluca’s Death</strong><br>Life went on peacefully for the next few days, we got lots of o2 on an expo, we had fuel, plasma shield finished, mush didn’t seem to be doing anything since everyone that reported said they had zero spores. There also didn’t seem to be any mush hunt going on, I love mush hunting but since Finola has very limited mobility I wasn’t paying much attention to suspicious activity. But due to the lack of action I decided to take matters in my own hands. I briefly asked Eleesha about Raluca’s activity because Raluca seemed to be doing very little and was presenting some odd behaviors but Eleesha wasn’t keeping an eye on her. So I started a conversation with Gioele, the only confirmed human by then (negative on xyloph). At the same time I was starting to mush hunt, we suddenly had a rush of confirmed humans. Ian got sick on an expo (the same one where we lost Stephen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"> and I got coprolalia thanks to it), Frieda got sick with slight nausea, Eleesha ate twice in the lab. So our mush hunt channel got bigger and the suspicious about Raluca were very strong, she wasn’t doing much but went out of ap/mp in a dorm, after showering without a soap and saying she was going to eat. She also didn’t seem very concerned about her morale even if she had spend at least a couple of cycles in a room with others. We decided to rush natamy riffle and Eleesha killed her. And she turned out to be mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We started discussing other suspects and the main suspects were Janice, because she wasn’t reporting much ap spent and some suspected Hua. Eleesha must have been high on adrenaline from killing Raluca and wanted to shoot Hua too with the natamy riffle. Luckily I was able to stop her and after taking a closer look at the chat I saw that Hua was actually killing several hunters and gathering scrap. We debated for a little to try to do the serum and gamble on using it on Janice but since the suspects about her were very little we decided to do pheromodem instead.</p><br><p><strong>Terrence’s Rampage</strong><br>We rushed pheromodem the cycle after Raluca was killed and I was shocked to find out that we had a perfect timing in killing her. Raluca and the other mush were planning to rush pilgred soon and return to sol. If we had waiting some more minutes they would have started the plan and we probably wouldn’t be able to stop them. As we were trying to figure who the second mush was and suggestions of being Terrence started to show up (because he would be the most efficient to work on pilgred with Raluca), neron announced that Jin Su was murdered. Terrence rolls into medlab immediately after, where Janice and I were. I figured he must have been the one killing Jin Su and was probably aiming for Janice after so I declared a ceasefire. Since Janice couldn’t be killed, he grabbed the armor that was carelessly in medlab and killed the very silent Chun.</p><p>Eleesha was away and still holding the natamy riffle, Terrence had the knife and the armor so while we were figuring the best way to deal with him, he spiked Roland and transfered into him. He didn’t waste time killing his old body and we were left without techs and Pilgred at 34%. While we waited, most people gathered in medlab to be protected by the ceasefire and we had a nice party there. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> While I went to sleep irl, Roland took off on a patrol ship (with the wrench and I don’t know if anything else). Next day we rushed the serum and were planning on moving the ship and cure him when he was forced to land (thanks to magnetic net).</p><p><strong>Awfully Timed Downtime</strong><br>While we were waiting for Gioele, a fire broke in the lab and then suddenly… downtime with a fire in the lab and one mush outside on a patrol ship… <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"> When the downtime ended, we found we only had 3 plants left, lots of broken things and that Roland had died due to injuries. We were able to recover from all the broken things, our hull was damaged but was still resisting but we had a problem with Pilgred… with no techs it would be very difficult to finish pilgred but then Kuan Ti gave us some amazing news… he said that on the next day he would have enough xp for tech! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Going Home</strong><br>He and Paola were able to get pilgred to close to completion and then Eleesha, Frieda and I finished the last 12% on it. And it was on good time because we had 21 hull and 1 asteroid would hit next cycle. We were still not sure if Gioele would be online to either take us to sol or to go to an o2 planet (we had 5 o2 left at that point) but with 20min to go to cycle change he logged in but then… didn’t do anything. The asteroid hit us and left us with 1 hull! I asked Gioele to take us back to sol asap since a simple fire could destroy us and he did soon after. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Random Notes</strong></p><p><em>Kuan Ti</em> - I saw in your final message that it was your second ship. I couldn’t tell, you did an amazing job! And getting technician really saved us all!</p><p><em>Terrence/ Roland</em> - That rampage when the circle was closing for you was almost our downfall, you hurt us really bad and I’m happy we were able to overcome it and have a nice victory. I’m just sad we weren’t able to cure you instead of you dying from injuries. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Paola</em> - You did an absolutely amazing job with comms! And were such a great person to have around (as well as Jin Su and Frieda, enjoyed playing with you).</p><p><em>Stephen</em> - I was really sad to see you die on that expo. I hope Gioele will hold his promises of status with little homages to everyone that deserves it.</p><p>And sorry for the long post, I do have a tendency to get carried away. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Terrence/Roland here. This was a fun ship for me. Its my fault that Raluca and me failed our plan to return to Sol. We were actually planning to do it the cycle before she was killed, but Jin Su was about to take us out of orbit and I didnt want to risk either him jumping us right as we finished pilgred, or him moving around the ship and me not having the ap to locate and get to him in order to transfer and jump to sol. By the time I realised, "duh, just empty the combustion chamber," Raluca had already gone offline and didnt make it back until a few minutes after she was killed. Next time I wont hesitate.</p><p>I considered trying to remain laying low after Raluca died, but had a feeling you would rush phermodem and based on the conversations there is should have been obvious I was the other mush. Also wasnt very comfortable with Eleesha having the natamy rifle in the dorm with me as I knew it was only a matter of time before she tested me with it. So I decided to rampage. Killed who I could, but wasnt able to get Janice due to Finola's quick thinking. Could have probably gotten Hua too if I had realised earlier that transferring resets fertile so you can use it for a second time in a day. I must have had to pick up the cat almost 100 times to get the Terrence body down low enough to be killed easily (had splashproof so now showering for dmg), so lucky that someone didnt come in the lab and kill me during the 10 minutes I spent doing that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In the end I wanted to make it difficult but not impossible for you all so instead of taking the extinguishers I took the wrench and compass in a patrol craft. Since the ship had magnetic net I ejected so me or the items could only be brought back in with the phasiphae and I figured they would assume the net would bring me in and not think to use the pasiphae. Still not sure how I got injured though. When I ejected the patrol craft got damaged so Im assuming that I got injured at that time.</p><p>This is probably the first ship Ive seen that didnt have a single inactive. Im sure if it wasn't for the downtime you all would have gone a lot farther. Well done.</p>
