                <p>Mush seems unique to other social games in that it inspires a lot of casual roleplay. Considering that, I was wondering if you all had any head canons.</p><p>For those not yet familiar with the term, 'headcanons' are basically theories or beliefs about the story behind a piece of media.</p><p>For example, Ian smoking some of his plants for *ahem* recreational purposes is, as far as I know, a common headcanon. A lot of people believe he blazes, but there is neither confirmation nor proof against that in the canon lore. (Unless you count that one text box in the intro, but I'm not sure which character that was pointed at.)</p><p>They can be inane and small. For example, Janice strikes me as the kind of lady who still likes hoolah hoops. No real reason. Has good hips for it.</p><p>Or, they can be larger theories. For example, I believe that Gioele's paranoia is a lifelong trait, and a major driving force both for his character and for how he interacts with others. For example, despite only being involved with the funding of the Ark, we know that he heard 'by chance' about the reality that Kuan Ti was building the Daedalus. He not only followed up on this, but broke into Kuan-Ti's office to learn the truth. If he's willing to break into an employee's office, what are the chances that he would stop from invading his daughter's privacy? We don't know why Paola ran away at 15, but it's possible he was overprotecting her and she got fed up. Even now that she's a rebel, he still tries to overprotect her by getting her onto the Daedalus, even though he is literally reducing their chances of saving humanity by trying to save his own flesh and blood over the more capable Nils Carson. So he's not only paranoid, but self-interested. Ultimately, he's a cowardly man who holds onto his dreams and family only when he can see that if he doesn't move to protect them, they will be lost. But he is very good at hanging on.</p><p>So, those are some of mine. I'd really like to hear yours.</p>

But really what's with the hair?!</cite><p>And not only a multi-billion dollar corporation, but one built around convict forced-labor. You build your fortune on the broken backs of murderers, crime syndicate members, and psychopaths, and you'd probably earn more than a few enemies. Maybe there were a few assassination attempts or prison riots (Motivating his decision to send all the prisoners to space-mining facilities, where the risk of them getting back to hunt him down was less) that caused him to become obsessed with personal security. The same reason why he's probably overprotective of Paola and dislikes her choices: he's heard the same story of young men and women getting involved with the wrong crowd, hooked on who knows what, and next thing you know committing crimes and ending up in his hands.</p><p>Another point: I think Andie has a deep-seated inferiority complex and minimal concern of his/her well-being. Most of his/her skill set seems to built around that notion (Devoted: being recognized by the Commander as worthy of specific orders seems to be a dream come true. Confident: Making his/herself open for everybody to talk about THEIR day, but won't even bother them with hers. And Expert: He/she tries so hard she hurts herself?), and is willing to do the thing with ANYBODY (which, seeing as all the other characters are Hetrosexual seems to suggest a willingness to comply to literally anything). His/Her predisposition to hero-worship of Jin Su and Derek also support thing point. Based on this, I've also always seen him/her as identifying more as feminine then masculine, and theorize that, since he's biologically male (since he can impregnate), that he might identify with the Federation almost in a Fascist, classically sadistic sense.</p>

Most of his/her skill set seems to built around that notion (Devoted: being recognized by the Commander as worthy of specific orders seems to be a dream come true. Confident: Making his/herself open for everybody to talk about THEIR day, but won't even bother them with hers. And Expert: He/she tries so hard she hurts herself?), and is willing to do the thing with ANYBODY (which, seeing as all the other characters are Hetrosexual seems to suggest a willingness to comply to literally anything). His/Her predisposition to hero-worship of Jin Su and Derek also support thing point. Based on this, I've also always seen him/her as identifying more as feminine then masculine, and theorize that, since he's biologically male (since he can impregnate), that he might identify with the Federation almost in a Fascist, classically sadistic sense.</cite><p>Although that makes a hella sense, please don't push it onto others playing the character. I get seriously annoyed with folks trying to decide my characters gender for me. There are woman who can't get pregnant so the biological aspect, no matter how it was intended at the developments beginning, is ambivalent.</p>

                <p>From what I've seen on the forums so far, the "Andie question" is one that people avoid discussing in general, just because it really does vary from person to person. But hey, this thread is for headcanons, which are inherently personal.</p><p>My Andie identifies as male and is very perky, charismatic, and committed to the success of the mission. This drive to do whatever he can to be useful to the people he respects is precisely what got him through three degrees without burning out. He's bisexual, but not interested enough in sex for it to be a major part of his identity. Vaguely similar to Dinscrusader's thoughts, I see him doing the thing with others more for their benefit than his own (though it isn't like he doesn't enjoy it too). He's quietly amused at other peoples's confusion when it comes to his gender.</p><p>I also found one I had about Hua as I made an attempt at drawing her last night. While people tend to just call her fat, I like to see her as a little powerhouse - of very average height (maybe a bit less), solidly built and muscular, but indeed with a layer of plump on top. Like a farm girl capable of punching out a cow. Or a Chew Chew, heheh. I'm still mulling over what I think of her personality, though.</p>

                <p>I think Jin Su keeps a deliberately professional divide between him and most of the crew, and is an extremely good judge of character. Though there is no doubt that he's competant and perhaps one of the more legally-minded of the crew, he's not afraid to ignore a couple of rules here and there and he has a good sense for the 'bigger picture'.</p><p>Case in point regarding his character insight, the chain of command goes Jin-Su (defacto leader), Chao (merciless sadist who has absolutely no interest in the commander role at all), Gioele (Paranoid, Twitchy mess of a man whose only experience of leadership is running a giant corporation, not a small tight ship under stressful circumstances) and Stephen (who may very well want Jin Su dead so he can take his commander position).</p><p>In having Chao has his #2, he protects himself simultaneously from Stephen (Stephen has to push his way through Chao AND Jin to get Commander) and Chao (Chao would rather be bullying people than piloting the daedalus).<br>Just to hammer home just how little Jin intends to part with the Commander position, the Commander's manual says something along the lines of "It would be remiss of me not to lay standing orders in the event that something should happen to me." and cuts off there.<br> <br>Remiss indeed, Commander Kim.</p><p>I do believe he'd be rather professional regarding most of the crew, and would do little more over the radio than give orders or request sitreps or organise the crew. To that end roleplaying him could be rather dull, except for the fact that I imagine he has an extremely close relationship with (having been working with her almost his entire career) Frieda as well as a more casual relationship with Kuan-Ti (ambitious, naive but with genuine potential as a leader) and a rivalry of sorts with Gioele. I also suspect that he'd be less authoritarian around Andie and Derek, Andie because she'd be awed and devoted to the point where it would be awkward, and Derek because... because... well. <em>Derek</em>.<br> <br>So yes, Jin Su is a stoic, professional leader. A strategic genius and with character insight that allows him to raise their mood and predict their actions. Jin-Su's sense of humour would probably be very dry and very subtle. <br> <br>One thing worth mentioning is that the skill 'cold-blooded' implies that he doesn't care much for his crew. However this interpretation is altered when you realise that the french name for the skill is Sang-Froid. Which translates, literally, as 'Cold-Blooded'. In french, referring to someone as cold-blooded says that they stay cool under pressure, literally that their body heat doesn't rise. As opposed to the english interpretation of cold-blooded where someone is remorseless and callous. A more appropriate translation for the cold-blooded skill would be 'Steel Nerves'. Jin Su is unflappable and calm, and always does what needs to be done, but is not a remorseless machine.<br> <br>In all, my interpretation of Jin Su is of someone who is an extremely capable leader, insightful, intelligent and deliberately isolates himself from most of the crew so they seem him more as a boss than a friend. He gets his social interaction from Andie, Derek, Kuan-Ti, Frieda and Gioele and doesn't afraid of nothing.</p>

                <p>Obviously that is your headcanon, Streaky, and it would be <em>remiss</em> of me to say you can't think of it that way. Just a correction though, the Titles are assigned via the A-TRUE protocol, the only way so far of keeping NERON happy by letting him choose who is in charge (of various things). I don't think anyone, including Jin Su, would be happy for Chao to be Commander since he is such a weirdo, but NERON probably admires his psychosis and that he will do whatever it takes to keep things running smoothly (even if that means blasting anyone who causes any trouble). Jin Su in particular would have been annoyed with Chao by causing this whole mess by killing the SDF replacement leader - I would think he planned to step down quietly and the Xyloph team could continue to work around the Mush presence.<br>That would also explain why Derek, despite taking Chao's role as Head of Security, is much lower in the hierarchy, given his incompetence.</p><p>The difference between sangfroid (which is a loaned/stolen word in English nowadays) and cold-blooded is an important one, you've covered it very well here.</p><p>I do agree with most of the crew interactions there, although I think he would definitely get on more with Kuan Ti and Frieda than his Federation subordinates; Gioele would definitely be less friendly given Kuan Ti and Jin Su continually rejected his suggestions/requests and kept him out of the inner circle concerned with the Daedalus.<br>Frieda would be more of a respect thing, given their time together on the main expedition ships to Tau Ceti etc. That being said, Hua has also worked with Jin Su on several expeditions, although a lot of that will have been landing dropships away from the Bridge where the other two are.<br>He may also get along with Eleesha - taking her onto the team when she was on the run - and Chun, being one of two Xyloph members to really know who she was (I went into more detail <a target="_self" href="/tid/forum#!view/104909|thread/38062098/2"></a>).</p><br><p>As for my own headcanon, the main jokes I tend to make are at the expense of Roland when playing Hua. When they crashed onto Mercury and were stranded for three days, I've imagined Roland pestering her sexually (making freakish balloon animals with condoms is my explanation of that phobia of hers) until she finally gives in to shut him up. It was not a satisfying experience, and he doesn't hear the end of it.</p>
