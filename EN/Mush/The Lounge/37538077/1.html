                <p>Hmm.. <strong>Gioele</strong> here.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Here is my evaluation for people who joined.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> (In Alphabetical order <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">)<em>In my opinion of course</em> I did not have enough time to mingle with everyonr</p><p><strong>Chao</strong> I like him he is active enough helps everywhere and not as bloodthirsty as other <strong>Chao</strong>'s I have been with.. and I would like to thank him for taking out the griefing <strong>Stephen</strong></p><p><strong>Chun</strong> I think she is active enough knows some part of the game and the pheromodem panic was hilarious <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico">.. you have to work on who to trust and what other people are doing.. and if you're taking lethargy make it to a point to be online at the beginning of a cycle and only go back to your bed near the end.. kinda sucks to not be able to research <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> <em>and yes you have to be more subtle in asking for foodtests</em>.. cant believe you still suspected me of mush even if I had an indirect foodtest at the lab.. got migraine when I killed <strong>Jin Su</strong> and where do I get those massive amounts of AP if not for coffee and rations <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">.. haha.. surely you cant believe I can phagocyte my way since we had contipaspore and antispore gas rushed..</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> she tries her best and as Janice has suggested on the endship comments you need more tact.. not everyone agrees on what you think is right.. I have been on ships with players who do not want to use astropad and they are more beneficial than those people who actually do.. and please do not just kill janice if you're bored, and yes the reason we jumped for MMM is to have a boring day 20 Edenship else we could've just went for a randomship <em>if we want a non boring ship</em>.. and do not just dismiss people's views on something.. They might be right <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> (<strong> Stephen griefing, Jin Su mush, KT mush</strong>)</p><p><strong>Finola</strong> you yes you!.. you were quiet but you were helpful when you are online.. maybe posting something if you water/cured the plants <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> I encourage to be more active on the chat and try to set up a time with your future researcher buddies so you can maximize research potential <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Frieda</strong> uhmm sorry I did not interact with you a lot you were quite quiet on this ship.. I guess <strong>Jin Su</strong> thought you were a threat and disposed of you at the bridge.. still hope you were more talkative on the forum tho <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">..</p><p><strong>Gioele</strong> well you're awesome!! because you're me hahaha.. but seriously.. I hope I did not offend anyone on my posts <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> and any suggestions/criticisms would be helpful <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Hua</strong> another silent but diligent pilot, thanks for all the scrap runs and killing hunters with roland.. I encourage you to be more active on your future ships chatroom <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Ian</strong> yep you were brain dead nothing to talk about here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Janice</strong> oh my sweet Janice.. you were roleplaying a bit.. and getting super helpful.. you did some suspicious actions but I believed you spent most of your AP helping the ship.. too bad no one appreciated it as much as they should have.. I was regretting every punch I did.. but I cant risk it.. <strong>Chun and Eleesha</strong> agreed on killing you.. hopefully we will be on better ships in the future <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> haha you were on high suspicions from me buddy.. moving at the same cycle we get the ration rebel base.. standing up and down on random times without uttering a word in the discussion chat.. you were stinking of mush but <strong>Chun and Eleesha</strong> did not heed my warnings <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> sorry man you were an all time suspect right from the start.. you were last to move.. and were chilling at the lab.. even after we are asking for relays on antispore gas.. you just shrugged it off.. the early went afk at Neron Core then immediately pointing at a dirty janice was a give away that you're trying to frame her or magically got online to check that she was early.. and you and Jin Su were particulary not helping the ship.. but taking up bedspace but no research relays..</p><p><strong>Paola</strong> I dont know what happened but you were active on the first 2 days and just went inactive and died of starvation <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Raluca</strong> oh Raluca you did not answer my love notes so I went to <strong>Chun</strong> to cure my loneliness.. Thank you for sticking out in the end and I knew you were still suspicious of me.. saw you pick up a ration then ate the one lying on the shelf.. <em>to prevent fungal kitchen perhaps?</em></p><p><strong>Roland</strong> your pilot reports were awesome you and <strong>Hua</strong> both did a great job <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">.. I did not have enough time to interact with you guys but I was glad both of you did your best and ask for the needs of the ship when you had excess AP <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Stephen</strong> yep you were a griefer.. hope you get sanctioned.. cooking all rations as much as you can before mush selection, taking a bedspace, and rushing do read the logistics made book the same cycle the rest of the ship agreed on <strong>Paola</strong> taking it..</p><p><strong>Terrence</strong> ehrm.. next time be more productive you took shooter pilot and I did not see you kill hunters.. or at least post in the pilot thread of your actions.. also by killing Eleesha even after she was declared human was too mushy on top of your silentness.. and please do not take pilot shooter before you even know if we have a tech or not.. good thing Eleesha took tech when she came around..</p><p>Hopefully I did not miss anyone.. it was a fine ship at the start.. but activity went down near the end.. all thanks to pheromodem I had a lil fun til the end hahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Janice here. I typed a lot in my closing -I'm still not used to the small space that I have. That was my fifth game and I've not felt so betray to date (thanks a lot, you blood thirsty savages.) I can only recall one time I "lied" but that was more myself confusing Alpha and Bravo sides of the ship, as I do from time to time. I probably would have done better with port and starboard. At any rate, I ran all over the ship doing various jobs because I had both the points and people were slacking. I even assisted in mush research and would have pushed it harder if Chun would only be present in the lab.<br> <br> I would like to know where the second time I reportedly lied. If it was about the food, I took portions of extra food with me from when Stephen cooked 10 rations at game start, prior to mush assignment. Those lasted quite a while. I don't recall but I think I had 4.</p><p>I never got a chance to answer Chun's question about my taking the chef book. I let time pass for anyone to take the chef book before I decided to do it but I didn't read it just in case someone wanted to discuss it. I took it to read it in order that I expedite the process of identifying and freezing foodstuffs as well as planting potential.</p><p>Yes, I was roleplaying but there was difficulty with mitigating the meta elements and not everyone RPs, which takes away from it all. Speaking of meta, Kuan Ti's excuse of going afk was very much meta and such mechanics are unavoidable for this game as it is. Sort of a double edged sword, I suppose.</p><p>I really don't have much to say about most of the crew as I was killed so early on. There was slacking present and it drove me to trying to fill in the gaps as there were plenty of things that needed to be done. None of Stephen's cooked rations went to waste at least.</p><p>Someone please explain this "strange behavior" I was exhibiting.</p>

                <p>Jin Su here. Sorry for acting stupid, but it's easier to get away with doing really bad things if you act stupid and don't make too much noise except about the few things you do for the ship. You have to admit, killing D3 signal by moving the ship "accidentally" was pretty damaging. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I was going to infect Gioele in the dorms on the round I went berserk, but unfortunately I missed day change by 10 seconds so I couldn't spike him twice (he had 1 spore from before). I figured the net was closing in very fast, so I took phagocyte, made me a grenade and bombed the burning bridge. I hoped I could do more damage then I did.</p>

                <p>You told me to "never leave," so I declined. I remember the wording because it helped to underscore the sense of oppression I felt on the ship. I felt confident in my ability to not get turned (you might recall I told you that I would be fine for the time being), though the lack of Chun's presence prevented me from pushing research as fast as I wanted -which I felt would have helped greatly to ensure everyone's safety. Imagine if you will, all those points I spent moving equipment into place, instead being put into research in addition to the skill bonuses I had.</p><p>I did stay in Bravo for a few cycles however, as my primary role was to ensure morale was maintained. This also meant I had to spend time in Alpha dorm as well.</p>

                <p><strong>Chao</strong> here.</p><p>Just some quick thoughts about the crew and our little adventure.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> I felt like i was playing catch up the whole time even though we only played for 4-5 days. First Stephen starts griefing and then hides behind Ian, i had to use all my shooter points and AP even after eating and waiting a cycle just to take him down.</p><p>Shortly after, Kuan Ti needs killing because he is a mushroom but im playing the waiting game, energy refilling would prove my greatest enemy.</p><p>Then, to make matters worse our sneaky mush captain manages to move us at the worst possible times (great work as a mush BTW) so he needed killed. All this in the space of about 3 days. I want to just kick myself for not having wrestler and torturer.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Our Pilots did an outstanding job. Never once did i worry about our hull, and i had the feeling that any hunters near our ship would be dealt with immediately. <strong>Hua</strong> and <strong>Roland</strong> didnt chat much, but they didnt need to. They let their patrol blasters do the talking. Having ace pilots made a huge difference.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Eleesha</strong> Had a major attitude, not sure what that was all about.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Janice</strong> was bludgeoned to death and turned out as human, queue major morale problems. I wasnt aware of why, or how that decision came about, but our fate was basically sealed at this point. We all agreed that any long term plans were out of reach with the loss of Janice and revelation about Jin Su. So the Pilgred and retro serum rush began in earnest.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Chun</strong> and <strong>Gioele</strong> got on like a pair of chattering squirrels and made up the bulk of our main chat messages, (as well as 90% of our pheromodem messages <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico">) and i thought for a while that they thought i was a mush. But no, it was just diligence.</p><p><strong>Final.</strong> In restrospect i dont think this ship ever had a real chance, and that's a shame because it feels like just when things started pulling together, it was over. Credit where credit is due to our mush players. While we did acheive a soft victory the pink menace managed to disrupt us just enough to force our hand back to Sol.</p><p>Now i'm on my 29th ship with very little activity and i find myself waiting for another MMM to try again for Eden. Thanks for an interesting ride everyone (including you <strong>Eleesha</strong>) and ill see you all next month!</p>
