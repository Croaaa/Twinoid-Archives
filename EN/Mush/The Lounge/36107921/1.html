This ship started to fill about 3 hours after the recent MMM jump; it was full just before the end of D1. 2 were inactive and died; both mush were caught and died; we failed to save Chao from accident damage on D17... but D19C2 we reached eden.</p><p>But for the first few days of the ship, I didn't think we had any real chance of getting past D5 at all.</p><p>I was Finola, initially level 3. I became a diplomat part-way through the journey.</p><p>We started off with swift anti-mush research, primarily Chun and I working on it; others focused on projects. Mush Ian focused on holding sample and apron, but not before gas was made at least. But Ian never went into a room by himself, he'd never had access to a shower, he was clean; so Ian never spored. Ian tried to trick me, telling me he held apron and sample to protect them; when we finally had the sample back and broke into the mush channel he was telling his partner, Terrence, that I believed him, he was fooling me...</p><p>Terrence gave himself away by having slept beside Janice for many cycles, then going to the lab to hug the cat then back to bed beside Janice and shower. Not terribly believable... we slew him before we finished Ian... but man was it a job to kill Ian, as it always is.</p><p>Mush channel showed just 2 infections, both level 1, both from room traps. Not terribly high intensity from their conversations there, they'd only had about 40 or so hours to make spores and antispore gas had been up within 15 minutes of the ship filling up; constipaspore followed swiftly. We decided that mush were probably no longer a problem, the number of spores were not either; though we did quickly finish mushovore 'just in case', but the rest of the antimush stuff was disregarded.</p><p>It took a bit to get the sofa up, Hua was our only Tech but there were some difficulties (did she even have the skill at start of play?), so it was sometime D2 or 3 before we even had the sofa. And there was some friction between Frieda and Paola, culminating in Paola, who had been sleeping in medlab for a few cycles before and after the sofa got built, running to the bridge and punching Frieda, who had just started using the untouched, being-wasted sofa, so Paola could take her sofa. Sigh.</p><p>And before Ian started 'safekeeping' the apron, Chao had been randomly torturing people; just wandering around near the front of the ship. You were clean and the roomlog showed you'd never had a chance to be dirty? No matter; torture here, torture there. Pop, pop. You never left a room with a camera? Oh well, torture, a few cycles later torture again.</p><p>Happily our mush made themselves obvious earlyish; Chao got a clearly appropriate and challenging target to direct all his attention to in Ian! Which went far in reassuring the rest of us that Chao was himself actually human. But several of us had a temper, I rather expected our ship to break into a few different sets of quarreling people who didn't trust each other.</p><p>As for me, I made a 'non-griefer' thread very, very early. I invited 3 others to it: Chun, whose no-nonsense attitude and focus on anti-mush research warmed my heart; Jin Su, who seemed wise, patient, interested, and communicative, and Roland, who was absolutely and totally an enthusiastic newbie. These people acted like themselves before and after mush were picked; very soon after we added Gioele, who had been our 16th to join the ship and who swiftly provided us with cameras once he had gotten his eyes open from cryosleep, and Chao, who was level 5 at least (he had crazy eye!), picked skills after mush were selected, and then seemed.... utterly unstrategic in how he used torture at least. But he did have a good heart, he wasn't a griefer... and he proved not to be a mush. Later in the ship he was darn useful, as was absolutely everyone, even those who struggled with language, struggled with lag (this ship happened during the terrible lag times! we too almost lost people who couldn't eat from the inability to load the game.... but only almost).</p><p>This ship was a great lesson. You don't have to be perfect to reach Eden, not even close to it. We had waste, we had greed, we had confusion, human-on-human aggression, several people who could only log in 1-3 times a day; we lost a crystallite+O2 planet to button pressing errors, we got scared of planets that were a giant mix of good and bad when time was tight and we barely could afford to find another... when the chips were down we went to a planet the same size and slightly more lethal than the one we refused before... and got that 3rd starmap piece.</p><p>We had 6 fires in one cycle; we had a cycle when 4 people in the same dorm each got their own metal plate (the same room had a roomshake then too); that same cycle had 4 other people in other rooms also get plates and roomshakes (really, Neron? Do you actually have that many plates, really?)</p><p>We had 4 drones, 3 turboed, 2 firefighters... one of the firefighters wasn't turbo.... We had people who played fast and 'wrong' when barely awake; we had projects getting finished (by humans) which were not the projects that were selected as the best to do -</p><p>And we had heroism. We had a Roland, a newbie, who about a day before the end, when we wiser folks finished an expo that could have gotten us a starmap but didn't said: Looks like we failed, there's 7 O2 left and 2 broken O2 tanks and very little AP, next to no food left, so how about that glory research then?</p><p>And when experienced heads said, 'Yeah, lets wrap up then', our newbie Roland logs in, looks around - sees the planet we are beside, and misunderstands. Roland doesn't realize that we tried the expo and failed to get a starmap, that we have next to nothing left.... oh no. Roland does understand that we're settling down to the end because of O2 tanks and low O2.... but Roland wants to try and wants us to try and wow, so much enthusiasm and fire and spirit....</p><p>He gets me to shift gears, some of the rest of us follow.... we manage with low odds to get the O2 tanks fixed... we get fuel loaded and get away from the planet.... Oh, poor Roland.... it was only then that I understood that he thought he was fighting for us to have the strength of will to go to that planet beside us, the one we'd already finished and failed at.</p><p>And then we did find another planet. A slightly darker twin to the one wiser players had, 5 or so days before, refused to try (18 zones, 1 crystal, 1 mankarog, O2, lots of stuff that could damage or help), but now we really couldn't refuse this one (18 zones, 1 crystal, 1 mankarog, <strong>no</strong> O2, lots of stuff that could damage or help).</p><p>We tried it. We got the starmap, the third piece we needed. With 3 O2 left and almost no AP, almost everyone full, we got the calculator research finished. We got the commander terminal fixed in the middle of the burning bridge. We got the calculations settled. Jin Su managed to take us home.</p><br><p>Ours was a ship full of stories. I've barely touched them here, and left about 90% of the events of our ship unspoken, at least as yet. It was a ship of greatness and pettiness, of frustration, of sublime successes, of learning, of unbelievable low odds, and of luck. Good luck, bad luck, ever so much luck. I was probably the dirtiest Finola ever (who was not a mush, that is). Come on out and take your bows, fellow teammates. We sure played out an incredible trip and a huge swarm of stories!</p>

I have no idea how you managed to survive, almost every time when i saw you - you were dirty, again and again. I calmed down only when you started help other people with their morale problems. I watched very closely over mush channel, when you volunteered to "fix" morale first time.

                <p>*grins at Chun* For my part I almost used the serum on our Captain - he almost never appeared to eat, he almost never appeared to use more AP than he made through normal cycle changes (a mush facing constipaspore is limited like that), and he never got sick - and I was getting sick left and right, from food, from cycle changes, from having been spored by the cat.</p><p>I think suspicion is very good. We should watch each other. I only 'did it' twice, both times with Gioele. Really though - Ian had to be alpha mush, but he never was dirty until he died. Terrence could have been a beta, but then there had to be another alpha - I left the dorm that had the shower when mush were chosen, then never went back - at the early part of the game I never was dirty - I couldn't have converted Terrence, so Terrence had to be Alpha, or someone else had to be... but I couldn't because Ian also was..... someone had to be making spores.</p><p>I actually was usually clean, oddly enough, despite how often you saw me dirty. But I did take to eating bananas each day, I caught Jin's speeches every chance I got, and dirty or not I usually slept beside Janice if I wasn't in the refectory pulling coffees. Considering Janice, most of us didn't need morale except for her; Jin was keeping her up; coffees carried to the dorms and old, soon to go dangerous bananas eaten.... it worked or seemed to.</p><p>Once I got dirty for one or another reasons, I just stayed dirty, especially after the soap burned up. I wasn't doing anything that required me to be clean, I had enough morale until later in the game when I started to panic attack, and really I just had 2 emergencies - the second one in the last cycle of the game, when I was down to 4 morale, not that it mattered, being the last cycle of the game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>About being a mush though.... I'm a very, very, very <em>mean</em> mush. Still good to watch, but yeah.... if I'd been mush I'd have been more obvious and more effective than Ian, I hope. Not much to wonder about <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/cool.gif" alt=":anim_cool:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Kuan Ti, I want my money back! I have never seen a more dangerous to fly ship. The constant fires and electrical spikes, O2 and fuel tanks that fail seemingly every cycle, the shaking and the weaponized ceiling tiles, what kind of madman are you?</p><p>Seriously though, this was one for the record books. I'm not as experienced as some of you (ship 6 for me) but I'm not sure that any of us had experience with what those last few days brought us. For anyone who has not made it to day 19, imagine if every problem that arose on Day 10, all 8 cycles, happened every single cycle. We had five fires in a single cycle...two of which immediately spread. We had eight crew members hit by steel plates AND room shakes in a single cycle. We had hunter waves in the 30s. Two medics (Finola and Chun) working full time with the healing pomade couldn't keep up.</p><p>My only regret is that we lost Chao so close to the end. He may have been a mush concern early, but as the days turned into weeks he earned his place with us in Eden.</p><p>I have a couple of stories to share, but I have to go to work. See you all again later.</p>

                <p>Helloooo, this is your captain, yawning nonstop because he... well, <em>she</em> has been up almost all night, stuck on a fiery bridge and worried sick while you guys were down on that planet with a mankarog. Wow, that last day... The whole trip was amazing, but the last day and evening were just so tense and eventful and memorable. I love the way you put it in your last words, Roland. It was indeed a "leap of faith" and a "punch in destiny's face", and I wouldn't have believed it was possible... actually, it was barely possible, I still wonder how we managed to do that expedition with so much against us. It was like Neron kept destroying things on purpose, targetting what we needed most, like the spacesuits that were broken by a fire just when we needed them, the research lab that was damaged when we had to finish the calculator, the Nexus door that was broken too, and that fire on the bridge that started again two minutes after I extinguished it, accompanied by an electrical spike that broke the command terminal at the worst moment.</p><p>We were so close to breaking point yesterday, all day, starting with both oxygen tanks that were broken and that Roland repaired just in time to buy us a few more cycles, and those hunters that slowly but determinedly destroyed the plasma shield while none of the pilots had the energy to do anything about them, and the constant fear of losing someone to a steel plate or a panic attack.</p><p>Then there was that awful dilemma between going to Frieda’s planet that had oxygen but a volcano or Kuan Ti’s planet with crystalite and a mankarog, or just giving up and going back to Sol before we had more casualties. We would have regretted it if we hadn’t tried, like we regretted not going to the first planet with a mankarog… or like I regretted losing that perfect planet with crystalite and no dangers (you have no idea how horrible I still feel about that…). But even if we did decide to try, it was almost miraculous that we managed to pull ourselves together, fix everything that needed to be repaired, save everyone’s lives after that horrible cycle change when Neron tried to kill almost all the crew members, and finally kill the aracks, load fuel, move the ship and launch that expedition.</p><p>And then there was the tension during the expedition, hoping we would find the final starmap fragment, wondering how we would ever have enough AP to finish the calculator and calculate the coordinates of Eden before distaster struck again, and praying every 10 minutes that the mankarog wouldn’t kill one of the team… while I was on that bridge in the middle of a roaring fire, with my finger on the “Return to Sol” button in case the mission failed. But we pulled together… again… and finally succeeded.</p><p>It felt incredible that we should have made it after such a hectic day and with such low odds… and yet it also felt so natural, because it had been obvious from the start that this crew had what it took to go very, very far. Maybe Eden wasn’t that obvious at first, because it depends so much on luck. And actually we found our first starmap fragment on a planet with no crystalite, where we weren’t really expecting it. But it was at least obvious that we could go further than Day 10. We had 2 technicians, I believe, Kuan Ti and Hua, helped by our newbie Raluca who also did remarkably well. Three pilots, and Roland and Hua were excellent pilots who knew how to handle aracks and asteroids and didn’t panick at the sight of 30 hunters. Two medics, Chun and Finola, who saved our lives again and again, and Janice and I for morale. Paola who did a splendid job on communications and finished Xyloph DB, several upgrades and got all rebel signals. Gioele, thanks to whom our four little drones were incredibly efficient. Frieda, who relentlessly searched for planets to make our dream of Eden possible. And Chao, who would have deserved to go to Eden with us, and was also very helpful after mush hunting was over. <br>Speaking of mush hunting, I never suspected you, Finola. You were often dirty but you also spent a lot of time with Janice, and you had been ill for a few days. And also, you were the one who told us that Ian had stolen the mush sample, just as I was the one who noticed that Terrence cuddling the cat wasn’t normal. By the way, I did eat a lot. I had to, really, if I wanted to have enough AP to kill hunters, make speeches, move the ship, and go from the dorms to the bridge and back all the time. I don’t think I would have been able to do that by eating spores, not with constipaspore serum.</p><p>I was never really worried about having anonymous mush. It did feel like Terrence and Ian had been alphas, that Ian hadn’t even tried to infect people, and that Terrence had spread several spores but on several people. The only thing I was worried about was someone being accidentally converted by the cat, though with the pheromodem and mushovore bacteria, we were quite safe.</p><p>Sorry, long post. <img src="http://intrusion.muxxu.com/img/icons/calim.png" alt=":intrusion_ccard_50:" class="tid_ico"> But as you said, Finola, our ship was full of stories, and those were just the most amazing 19 days.</p>

                <p>Gioele, I was truly impressed by how well you all reacted to everything that was going on. Finola and I were a little worried when things started to be difficult, because we feared that some crew members would not realized how dangerous it was to waste AP or resources, to stay in isolated places, or to fail reporting their health. But after a while everyone understood and got more disciplined.</p><p>It was also remarkable that no one panicked in the last days, or even earlier than that. There were steal plates and roomshakes all the time, the oxygen tanks kept breaking along with everything else on the ship, not to mention the big waves of hunters and the nightmare of constant fires with no detectors. It... could have been a lot worse, actually. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> But nobody ever panicked or begged to go back to Sol, nobody yelled in fright at the sight of almost 40 hunters, nobody ever felt discouraged (or if they did, they hid it well). And that was really impressive.</p>

                <p>Highlights for me...</p><p>-Seeing 14 active players, even if we did have to kill two for being Mush.<br>-Working with the two most organized players I have ever met.<br>-Getting to play with Robotics as Gioelle.<br>-Watching the best team of pilots I have ever seen.<br>-Seeing Hua prove that you can collect scap from hunters on Day 12<br>-Knowing that we were all looking out for one another. I was brought back from the brink of death (health and morale) while offline too many times to count, and returned the favor as often as possible.<br>-How we had to treat 'the brink of death' as 10 hp in the last few days...<br>-Deciding not to go to the Crystalite/Markong planet on Day15-ish when we had plenty of supplies. I knew that would be a big deal one way or another when all was said and done.<br>-Being forced to go to a worse planet on Day 19 when we had almost no supplies.<br>-Going 6 days without getting dirty, and 18 days without a shower. Wanted to see i I could make it to Eden without showering, but I needed to bath to use the Calculator.<br>-After the final expo, watching the mass confusion in chat due to lag and overlapping posts. At one point some people thought I had one starmap, others thought I had two, Paola might have had one, one might have been still in Incarus Bay, and Hua might have been bringing one from the lab...then watching the same confusion happen again over who had enough AP to push the Calculate button.<br>-Realizing it didn't matter who pressed the button first, and just hitting it...Calculating the route on the first try.<br>-Seeing the room message that resulted (I almost missed it...thanks Finola)</p>
