                <p>So, the first thing I did was pretend to be new to Janice. And bronze. Sorry for the charade, but I wanted that extra bit of leeway it might have granted me if I messed something up. It was my first time Alpha Mush and I was pretty excited, didn't want to end up blowing it because of some mundane detail I'd overlook.</p><p>It's worth noting that we had at least four non-native English speakers, including Chun, and sometimes I honestly didn't understand what they were trying to say.</p><p>Almost immediately after Mush were selected, Eleesha tried to kill Chun. She was definitely a griefer; she was never once Mush. I grabbed two blasters, ran to Chun's aid, and killed Eleesha. I figured it would buy me points on the Human side. And I just don't like griefers.</p><p>Shortly thereafter I realized that if anybody had thought about it, they'd realized I was carrying around two blasters, and therefore I was probably more than just bronze. So I took IT Expert on top of Shrink, so if anybody asked I could just pretend to be silver. Nobody ever asked.</p><p>I noted to my Mushy partner Jin Su that we pretty much controlled morale on this ship. And we proceeded to do exactly that. To my knowledge Jin Su performed no speeches, and I gave out virtually no comforting. I stayed in the dorms, sure, but that only gets you so much, especially when I'm hogging a bed. I basically did just enough of my job to keep me under the radar (I think).</p><p>The game had started early-mid Day 2. I started running around, producing spores as I went. I messed up the first two and had to Phagocyte them. But Jin Su gave me the go-ahead to take all the spores, so I went ahead and made all four that day. I never posted to the dirty thread (I had no Human reason to be dirty), I never picked up or used the soap, but I showered frequently and I didn't have Splashproof. I always had (poor) excuses ready for all the damage I was taking, but nobody ever asked.</p><p>Day 2, Cycle 8. Frieda is standing in the Nexus, idling. What? Well, not going to look a gift horse in the mouth. Near the end of the cycle I went to "put my computer points into projects so they don't go to waste with carryover." I then sat there for... 30 minutes? Just waiting. And then the day changed. That's two spores into Frieda. Nobody said anything about us idling together away from a camera. Did anybody even notice? Unfortunately she went back to the bridge before I could finish the job the next day.</p><p>Sometime during day 3 I picked up Trapper. The Antispore Gas was done so I only had two spores to work with, and not really many places I could hide spores in. Projects were coming along at a snail's pace, so I figured I was safe in going back and forth to the Lab to help with Research. I would put one point into Research then go all the way back to the dorm. I trapped Bravo Bay. Not only had I left both blasters in there, there was some expedition equipment still lying around. Not to mention the fighter ships that Roland was using. Roland picked up that spore.</p><p>I also infected Schrodinger, with Chun's permission, because she believed that if I cuddled him infectiously it would show on the lab's camera. Teehee.</p><p>Day 4 was more of the same. I trapped Bravo Bay again. I think Gioele picked up that spore, but I'm not sure. I ate the other spore because the shower was beating the hell out of me. Thanks go to Ian for healing me a few times without asking where the damage was coming from.</p><p>Day 5 I logged in and jumped in my seat. Frieda had mutated in the dorm I was sleeping in. She'd smacked Hua and Chun once or twice and then hadn't done anything. Jin Su hadn't said anything to me about what was going on, and had in fact quit the private channel we were using. The radio logs showed pandemonium and confusion. Nobody seemed to be sure what was going on, and I was pretty much in the dark as well. It took me half an hour to catch up on reading. All I knew for certain was that Jin Su had been outed, had jumped prematurely (simultaneously abandoning Roland and screwing the crew out of both fuel and a great oxygen planet [the ship really needed oxygen]), and then he was assassinated but at that point he was no longer Mush. He had transferred, and he hadn't told me who he transferred to. Gioele and Raluca each had a spore at the time of transfer, but having no idea which one was my new partner, I would be giving myself away by guessing wrong. I had full or almost full AP, and anybody that was keeping track would have known this because I was spending a lot of time in bed. I had accidentally clicked myself out of bed already, so I did the only thing that seemed reasonable at the time; pass myself off as Human by killing Frieda. Frieda, I'm sorry, but you were already outed and almost dead, it seemed like the right choice.</p><p>I fully intended to keep passing myself off as Human. Suspicion seemed to be off my shoulders. Frieda had anonymush, which I immediately took after I killed her. Even though I knew someone had seen that there were three Mush on the Comrades bar at one point, I fooled myself into thinking maaaybe nobody would believe it. Then Jin Su-turned-Raluca finally contacted me and ran to my dorm, pleading for help. I knew it was my partner for sure, because nobody else knew about the ace I was keeping up my sleeve: Diplomat. I'm a level 5 Gold Janice, I could pick and choose when to equip my skills. Jin Su-turned-Raluca wanted a Ceasefire. I still didn't know what the plan was, but I trusted that he had one and that all he needed was time. I went ahead and outed myself to protect my partner.</p><p>And then I waited. I told Jin Su-turned-Raluca exactly when Ceasefire would end, and begged him to fill me in on the plan. I never heard another word out of my partner. When the Ceasefire ended, my partner was set upon and killed shortly afterwards. There was no plan. I had given myself away for no reason.</p><p>No turning back now, though. Chun had been begging for Comforts for a while, so I knew she was low. I demoralized her four times. I ran to central bravo storage, produced two spores and ate them, and grabbed two oxygen baubles. I made the mistake of trying to sabotage the tanks, which wasted precious AP. I made my way to Rear Corridor and waited a cycle. Kuan Ti punched me twice and I acted like it didn't hurt (it did, 5 hp worth to be exact, leaving me at 11 hp). Cycle changed, Chun suicided (yesss!). I ducked into the Nexus and changed up all the BIOS settings, turning off death notifications, switching the lock to Projects, and turning off CPU Priority. I was going to idle in the Nexus another cycle, but Gioele had other plans and came in punching. I ran as far as I could, to the rear alpha turret, and he followed me. Gioele had me down to 1 hp. But he ran out of AP and then had to leave for work. I figured this was the end, someone would come kill me, but I still had a plan. Two more cycles was all I needed.</p><p>I checked in from time to time over the next six hours. I sang a lot. I heckled people who would listen. I told Gioele in a PM that I was touching him inappropriately. Anything to keep myself entertained. It was very late for me but I wanted to see this through.</p><p>The cycles passed without incident. I dove into Alpha Bay 2 and took off in the Pasiphae. Now the ship was desperately low on oxygen, there was very little morale and virtually no way to recover it, and no way to collect scrap. I was doomed, but confident I'd done as much damage as possible. I went to bed.</p><p>I was surprised I was still alive when I woke up. I heckled a bit more. Within an hour or two, though, the ship moved and I was left behind. I think it took another day before the ship ended, and it looks like everyone either died of asphyxiation or suicide. So... did I win?</p>

                <p>I would say you did pretty much win, everyone is dead. Except the 17 character that's still sleeping <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> But without oxygen that one will die too soon.</p><p>Gioele here and I don't have to say an awful lot about this ship. But it was like always. Too many suspects and not all can be mush right? ^^<br>The round started for me like most of the times. Checking out skills of the people I meet on my route. <br>I have to say Jin Sus skill choice made him a big suspect from the very beginning. Since he took "cold blooded" lvl 3 skill instead of one of the other 2 "useful" ones. And I did mention his lack of AP usage for the benefit of the ship more then once in our more private chat but I never feelt it is enough of a reason to kill him. And like you wrote yourself. It doesn't seem he actualy did alot. So he pretty much played the inactive that's sometimes there and most of the time not.</p><p>Also Ian did mention that he healed you twice at some point. And we also talked about your lack of comforting others.</p><p>But like I said before. There were always other suspects as well and I never felt convinced enough to be the one that just starts acting/killing. Like Raluca that wants to stay dirty (no problem with that) but then runs around all over the ship carrying stuff to icarus bay. Or Frieda that mixed up oxygen with hydrocarbon depostits, etc.</p><p>Sadly I made the wrong call at the end when I killed Jin Sus body (Raluca) who wasn't a mush at that point anymore. Raluca had to leave in RL, if I get the endscreen right, so she never answered my question about our private morale conversation and then I just didn't want to wait anymore and give Jin Su another cycle to do stuff.</p><p>Anyway what I might have missed at the end when you told me you were touching me inappropriately, did you actualy comfort me? Because later it looked like I had more morale. But I didn't pay attention to the logs... Oh and your singing was quite bugging. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":tid_razz:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I was saving up AP, so no I didn't actually comfort you. Turns out I could have, though, and now I'm kind of sad I didn't. It would have been silly and fun. I also could have jumped in the Pasiphae a cycle earlier than I did since I forgot to factor the Launch Propulsion System into my plans. But that was just one more thing I did wrong on top of a lot of other dumb mistakes I made.</p><p>Next time I promise I will be a much more challenging foe.</p>
