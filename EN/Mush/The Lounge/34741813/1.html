                <p>So <strong>Jin su</strong> here. <br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1666" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1666</a><br>So summary is that i were planning to lead this ship to day 15 cycle 1 , but that breaking of o2 tanks forced me to get back to sol . 1 O2 tank every cycle .... And Chun ... Werent talking at all until she needs something . 1h till cycle change and most likely no one would have checked in and she had only 1HP left .. Most likely dead next cycle . <br>My last message : <br><strong>Well im Forced to get back to sol Due to these reasons :<br>1. Chun may die at cycle change and that -1 morale .<br>2. Day change without chun is -2 morale .<br>3. O2 tanks breaking every cycle ....<br>4. I will most like be dead after day change (if unlucky b4).<br>5. Who knows who else will have panic attack and will die due to - morale due to Chun death , Panic attacks and Day change (maybe without my speeches as i will be back at cycle 7 and may be dead due to illness Depression or Panic attacks , loss of Chun) .<br>Did all i could , but 15 cycle 1 is just a dream for now <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>My 3rd best ship . Good job people . Bit disapointed in chun and maybe Kuan ti since day 10 <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Talk more .</strong> Kuan Ti were doing a good job even thought stopped talking at some point . And chun were doing something , but stayed silent most of the time ..... <br>We had exact amount of o2 to reach day 14 cycle 8 and would have gained +1 o2 due to oxydated ducts and some point . Was a bit of a risk trying to reach day 15 and we may have made it if not that last min chun request for Healing and Broken o2 tank which did not got fixed b4 i had to go off . <br>Better luck next time guys . Thnx for listening to me even thought im not the smartest guy in Mush , but had more experience than most (maybe all as we get new player coming to mush daily). <br>As always i claim that i will find mush withing few days and i did . Glad that it turned great in this ship (no mistake , no mus rampage b4 death or other silly things that may have ruined us ) .</p><p>PS. Janice you were hungry thats why you were loosing HP . Strange that you did not notice that ... Lost you too early <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> <br>Ian - in active and most likely wont check this , but lost bananas and stayed without any plant until we found some fruits at 1 planet . Planted em myself so dont worry , we were fine without you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Someone else should have checked em daily ... Had no AP/MP to drop there since i were hunting mush and were busy with other stuff as survival or expos <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Frienda - Ask for healing then if no one heals you b4 cycle ends heal yourself . Dont rush it every time when you got low HP and you are online .<br>To me and others who were working at lab . We should have finished serum (or at least started it) , but personally i did thought of other things at this ship and totally forgot to add serum to priority list ... Mush were dead since day 4 so we had 10 days to finish it . After mush is dead other anti mush researches loose priority . Note for the next time , if mushes are dead make serum .</p>
