                <p>All right... Let's start! I prommise that I will try to make first post short ^^ Those who know me, know also that it is not easy task for me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But... Let's try!</p><p>This is a ship in question!<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6944" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6944</a><br>Nice one, isn't it? ^^ And who am I? Of course! I forgot who I am! And I am Your's only, unique, commonly uncommon TuttiKuanTi! Ehmm... Sorry... Alpha Mush <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So... How to start it? Maybe by saying that it was really nice ship with really good people <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And... I am sorry! I am sorry that I was lying into Your faces, into Your eyes with a smile <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I am sorry, but that is Mush Job, isn't it? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Especially You <strong>Stephen</strong>! I want to apology especially You!</p><p>However Stephen - all tips, all game informations I gave You were real! I never lied to You about game mechanicks. Lying to newbie would be simply below my code of honor, unless I would really have to in order to not play against my own team.</p><p>But... Let's start from begining of ship. Oh! NO! NO! NO! Let's start from end of my previous ship! You see... It happened somehow that my previous ship ended for me a bit earlier due to my own, stupid mistake. Why does it matter? It matter because <span class="tid_user tid_user_1726406 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1726406">sperbi</span> also finished His ship more or less in same time... And we decided to try and jump together on same ship! It worked! YAY! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> It took us two days to find such possibility, but it worked out finnaly <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And so I went as <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> and He joined shortly after me as <strong>Eleesha</strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I do hope to hear from You in this theard ^^</p><p><strong>First glance at ship's crew</strong></p><p>So... Eleesha I knew well. I knew She will be active and competent. But what about rest of crew? This is what I can say.</p><p>Firstly - we had only two inactives - those were <strong>Paola</strong> and <strong>Terrence</strong>. They both were inactive from start till end. Only diffrence was that Terrence went into turret before going inactive, while Paola did litelary nothing.</p><p>Secondly - we had 3 totally newbie players. Those were <strong>Ian</strong>, <strong>Derek</strong> and <strong>Stephen</strong>. <em>Ian</em> was only wantering around ship and taking items from one place to another without making any sense out of it. He even took Mush Sample from lab and holded it for quite some time (which was NOT inpacting Mushes despite what you may think). He died from lack of morale. Oh! He was also punching people out of beds... Nice pecifst, isn't He? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br><em>Derek</em> was playing better. He was doing usefull things for ship, but was not very communicatve. There was Newbie Help theard, He didn't used it even once to ask questions. He was getting dirty easily and generally was looking mushy for hummans <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> At some point I tried to protect Him from being lynched ^^ Didn't helped in the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Derek! More communication and You should be allright! And... So that You know it - You went in our way once! &gt;.&lt; <br><em>Stephen</em> was one of best newbies I ever knew! Active, communicative, observant... He was studying Mushpedia regullary and was asking questions when didn't knew something. I am sure You will become great player once <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I was very happy to have You on board <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> - my partner in Mush! Second Alpha! He and I were both Gold Players at begining of ship! On my previous ship as Alpha Mush I had partner that was getting in my way constantly... NOW I had partner I could counted for and knew to NOT be let down! Jin Su! Thank You! You were awesome partner and despite Your low level in Mush, You have been one of greatest help for me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Great team work! <br><strong>Eleesha</strong> - I already told few things about You. Competent, active and dangerous as hell! You were main reason why Raluca was not converted! She was D2/D3 objective to convert for us... But because we knew You WILL be snifing around, we had to wait and start from You <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> After that You have become greatest help that Mush could get ^^ Very bright thinking with cold blood! I never saw You panicking and You always put good of team before Your own! Splendid partner in Mush! We were all sad after your death... Apart of Gioele of course <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Chun</strong> - very silent, yet always lurking... You were our nightmare Miss! And we never could be sure what You will decide to do out of sudden. Definietly good player You are. But too silent <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Hua</strong> and <strong>Roland</strong> - piloting couple! I will only say that I don't remember seeing even one hunter lasting more than two cycles! Did I mentioned 20+ metal scraps in AB2? No? Well... It is worth mentioning! Great work pilots! Sorry Hua for not converting You at end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Complications <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Ralulu<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></strong> - my RPing love! I tried to get Your attention so much! I wanted You into Mush from very begining! Yet You were cruel, cold and so... So... Detached! I am SORRY for that WRENCH rant ^^ But that was calculated actually <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I wanted to keep hummans focused on not important things ^^ If that is worth anything, than know that your answer was brilliant and I liked it very much <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Calm and to the point. I am sorry for Your death, but at that point... Well... I will talk about it in another post. Not in this one. Too long story for that. Your death made me very sad. As a side note - You and Frieda should pay more attention on logs... You just didn't noticed defaced logs once! ^^<br><strong>Janice</strong> - active, very fast in responce and rather unlucky I would say. Your reaction on Eleesha's mistake was so fast that we nearly failed to react in any way... And you made me panick for short time! When You joined our ranks You were also of great help to manipulate what was rest from crew by using Your "Comfirmed Humman" status <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Too bad You were unlucky at end... <br><strong>Frieda</strong> - more activity please <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> You started good, You found nice planet, You were part of Mush Hunt chat at some point even and than... Death from starvation. Sad. Really sad. Oh... And in future PLEASE! Do wear glases and do notice that room logs has been defaced, ok? Thank You! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Andie</strong> - very busy player, doing research at first, than scrap running, and comms as well... Did I mentioned scanning planets? No? Well... She did also those <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Problem was lack of communication! You communicated very little and in very raw form. You most of time was sending only most important info. Nothing more.<br><strong>Gioele</strong> - very dangerous for us. You were ultra suspicious and You saw through my mask... Also You noticed how strange and calm it was on this ship... Only You believed that Mushes are active, are sporing and are infecting. You forced our hand and we had to convert You <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> You were very effective player... However you lack sense of elegance. You are more "brute force" player, while we were ones that liked something more than "to the point" strategy. I have feeling that You would finished this ship as Mush around D6 when there were already 4 of us by ramaging. Well - that was not our way of doing things. I am gratefull to You for helping us out. That was nice of You. But... Let's be honest - we would never be able to form good team, as our views on things are completly opposite. NOTE! I am not saying that your's are bad or worse - they are just diffrent.<br><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> - You were best of THE BEST! Seriously! You are true paragon! You were so commonly uncommon! So unique! They should build a statue representing Your greatnest ^^ Oh! Wait! That is me ^^'</p><p>So... That was our crew. Nice crew I would say <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Very nice. I will start talking about story tommorow evening - after I will return from work <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So... Please, whoever would like to say something before I will start - please, do it! It is right time for that! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

They taught me a lot of things, I really couldn't have asked for better teachers! But there's one more thing I need to say to Kuan Ti: <br><cite><em>Stephen</em> [...] <br><br>Now... For REALLY important players...</cite><br><strong>Hey, that hurt!</strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> <br>I already don't know what to feel. Don't make this even more complicated for me! I guess... I can be happy? Somewhat? I survived, made it back to Sol, and... I even got a "Discovered Supernova Award", whatever that might be! Sounds nice considering it was my first ship.<br>But I REALLY didn't expect that my company in the end consisted of... 4? mush. That was quite a shock!</p><p>At one point in the game, I was somewhat sure that Jin Su was mush. Multiple times, the thought that one of my mentors (Kuan Ti and Eleesha) were mush also crossed my mind. But I did not like that thought at all and so I did not pursue it - looks like this was quite the mistake! <br>After the crew bar showed three dead mush, I dropped all my suspicions. "People's beliefs are shaped largely by their desires.", as they say. Then again, it looks like I couldn't have done anything significant anyways at that point.</p><p>My biggest mistake probably was telling the wrong people about my suspicions considering Jin Su. Back then, we still had... 12(?) people alive, but I never got invited into any mush hunt channel or anything like that, and I never spoke with Chun either. Furthermore, she seemed to be somewhat hard to approach anyways, so... long story short, I told Kuan Ti everything! And of course, he came up with a nice explanation for the things I saw. ...No one on the ship had Slimetrap, right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Well, I'll be looking forward to reading the full story! Will add some things later on.</p><p>Oh, and... Kuan Ti! Next time we meet, I'll make sure that you put me on that "important players" list! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

You managed to put us (Kuan Ti, Jin Su and Eleesha) into VERY difficult situation at some point and... And I will not say anything more to not spoil story, which I will start writing at evening ^^</p>

                <p>Hi! Born as human, newborn and died as mush, Eleesha here <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>I am glad, that already some people found the thread. I can just tell everyone, who likes to read Ap-threads, will like that one very much. Because it is a nice story! It could just be that it will be a long one, but surely no boring one ^^.</p><p>Hi Stephen, you really are a great newbie. So much activity, so much joy to ship with and even in your first game you were already more vigilant than most experienced players! We were proud of you and at same time it gave us trouble that the newbie we helped was such a problem for us <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Hey Hua, you did surprise us in the end, <span class="tid_user tid_user_8191292 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8191292">Europa</span> hinted already why.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed the game too, I can imagine that as human you could have got the impression, that the ship is just a rather normal one, able to return to sol, not much expeditions, but all mushes got in the end. Well, I hope your feelings were intensified, when you realized that you were tricked the whole time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Hey Jin, I hope you will show up too, you were such a loyal mush buddy, not hesitating any second, when I was about to die to help make gold out of the shit that happened, THX! ^^</p><p>Regarding that I also hope to hear, what Janny, my murderer wants to tell me at one point ^^.</p><p>The title of the Ap-thread is familiar to me! That is what Gioele told us, when he joined our force and we spoke about what we planned and his role in it..."way too convoluted plans" he told us and he wasn't very satisfied with all our planning and deceiving and focus on conversion. But for us it was a compliment, these "way too convoluted plans" made the voyage a thrill! I tell you every day! we either were in great hope or in really big despair! So much things went right ... and so much dangers, problems occured, in the end even a big mistake happened to me, I still don't know how that happened, but ...<br>WHATEVER happened, we ALWAYS found a solution in the end and that made the mush run just awesome and so much fun! I think that was one of my best ships, if not my best.<br>Only regret is that we didn't got Raluca and instead she died, mainly because I died a bit earlier as planned because of my mistake and because Gioele didn't want to help with conversion then...<br>But the whole story will unfold soon!</p><p>So I will start with my next post with the bit of story, which isn't known fully to Europa, my time as human.</p>

                <p><strong>My short human time</strong></p><p>I started as usual by taking care of weapons. First surprise, Chun did already pick up the knife, first time I have seen a Chun doing that ^^. So I only hid a blaster and grenade, told Chun about their location and felt already safe from mush rampages.</p><p>Next step was research, where I helped: I dunno whether already before first daychange after mush selection, but definitely until a day after mush selection Antispore gas, constipaspore serum and mycoalarms were already done. Nice, I thought, mushes shoudl already be crippled <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>Note: TuttiKuanTi was person who did help probably most with research...He also did deceive me very well, I was also in private chat with him, he did also mentioned his concern of me being mush and wanted to know at which cycle I am "finnaly" ready to relay with him research-I would help with research, right? so many Aps he spent there, even more than a mush should have... so I felt already safe with him and thought that he is most probably human-why shoudl he cripple himself that much, right? ...That was an error in the end.</p><p>Also something happened around that time, which was giving me a hard time for mush hunting:<br>Paola died of starvation (didn't end tutorial) and I was comms officer <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"> .. I like to be comms officer, but at same time that means that I have no or almost no energy to track down mushes...</p><p>Also after doing research I wanted to build me sofa with apron, but what happened? Suddenly Jin Su did build it already..and got dirty! Also that shoudl have made him more suspisious in my eyes. But soon after washing he went to bridge (because of Gioele's paranoid we had cameras in lab, bridge, Adorm, Bdorm and Nexus), was only standing there and gave me his logistics ! Isn't that nice? Trying to give me a huge amount of ap! maybe I am able then to do comms AND track down mushes, so I thought better of him..another error in the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Furthermore since Kuan Ti was that helpful and I had to accumulate Ap for a while after helping with comms I even lent him my scooter...I regret that too.. I told Kuan to give me scooter back at next day, but he didn't speak about it on his own.. should have made me more suspicious...well..short time later I was already turned to mush.</p><p>I made not very much notes during my time as human, often I am writing down for each character what he has done and whether I felt the character could be mush...<br>What I did write down was only that Gioele did confirm himself by doube eating as human already, that Andie helped very much at research, that Janny ate, helped with research and installed cam in lab.</p><p>Also only shortly before turning mush I made the following notes:</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">good people: stephen, Tutti, me, Gioele, Raluca, Janice, Chun, Andie, Hua<br><br>maybe mush: Frieda, Jin, Roland<br><br>inactive: Paola, Terrence<br><br>strange behaviour: Ian, Derek (low participation, touched Raluca's pilgred)<br></span></p><p>You see, I thought at that point that one mush is amongst the inactives and the other one...more probably Ian or Derek, who were acting suspiciously, but at same time also like new players.<br>Ian did pick up the mush sample and went away with it, passed Bravo dorm and was new player... maybe he just read the in-game mush tips, right? ^^ Luckily I noticed him going around and did immediately do a "general announcement", where I told him to "put down the mush sample immediately and tell location!" He did listen here and dropped it, that was also only time he spoke in main chat ("mush sample dropped in Adorm" ). Derek on the other side didn't use very much aps and helped with pilgred while Raluca didn't asked for any reset....</p><p>So actually I didn't expect what was about to happen at next daychange... and how it happened xD<br>When I noticed that defacer was used, i also noticed me being mush already...</p><p>Kuan Ti did distract me with a special private message around day change I want to add! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Otherwise, I would have been turned too I think, but with a very very small percent chance that I might have been able to flee or inform someone...seriously I doubt it, but still mean...and brilliant! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Some of my „personal highlights“ <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Most exciting moment:</strong><br>Finding a dirty Jin Su with an obviously wrong alibi and planning to kill him with Kuan Ti! It never happened (of course), but I guess I'll let Kuan Ti tell you that story!</p><p><strong>Worst moment(s):</strong><br>The journey itself was great! And that ending... well, I would count it as the „most surprising moment“, not as the worst moment. The worst moment is yet to come! It will be reading Europa's full story and thinking „IF ONLY I KNEW!“ again and again! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> The first of these moments already happened: The damn list! It is a physical item? Really? Like, you can pass it around and everything? If only I knew! I thought the list was "only" some kind of pop-up window that Eleesha gets! Ahhh, so frustrating! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"> I might have put more attention to it if I knew.</p><p><strong>Saddest moment:</strong><br>Derek's assasination! I still don't know who killed him, but after it happened I felt kinda guilty. Derek acted a bit... rash at times, but this just shows that he did not hesitate to help the crew. Gravity sim broke down? Derek is on his way! With no wrench. Or gloves. Or apron. Or technician skill. And you know what? He still managed to repair that thing! <br>But Derek's altruistic actions had consequences. He showed up to an expedition with only 8 HP, he got dirty in a room with an apron in it... and I pointed these things out rather harshly. Derek, I am so sorry!</p><p><strong>Weirdest moment:</strong><br>At D10C8, it was already decided that we were going back to Sol next cycle. I... did not really know what to do at that point. I thought we were mush-free, the projects were all done, and, well... I ended up heading to the bridge and flirted with Andie! Why? No idea! Guess I just wanted to see what happens, although I expected nothing to happen. <br>Well, something did happen. Andie did not hesitate very long, removed the camera, and... I do not need to spell it out, right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> And directly after day change, „it“ happened again!</p><p>So... Kuan Ti and Jin Su! I guess you felt pretty good when you entered the bridge to claim your victory at the start of D11! But literally minutes before that, I myself was having a pretty good time there. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> It was also weird, unexpected, a bit awkward, but... I got a lot of morale from that, so it must have been a good time! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Best moment:</strong><br>I honestly have no idea! The whole trip was so fun! I started out as a silent, ration-wasting chef, but quickly got more and more involved. What looked like a "mere browser game" turned out to bring me one of the most extraordinary experiences I ever had with gaming! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Uhh... I think it is mine time to write part of story <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Rather big one <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Not a small one <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Definietly big! I will not hold myself back from doing it! Soo... I described a crew of Daedalus... Describing Daedalus has no sense as it is always exacly the same <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> There are some random items that we may have or not have... But those are details only! Well... We did got Babel Module, and didn't get Oscilloscope. Happy now? Happy! Good. Let's get to story now...</p><p><strong><em> 1. Before I learned the truth...</em></strong><br><strong>Janice is a Nostradamus!</strong><br>So I woke up on ship... Ship that already was in progress for some time. And I choose to play as Kuan Ti. Why Kuan Ti? Firstly - I really like this character. Secondly - that was only character that I felt like taking with active gold (thank You <span class="tid_user tid_user_516 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="516">Peanutz</span> - Your gold days gift helped doom not one, but two ships...) from those who I got. I thought a little about picking Chun... But in the end decided to stay with TuttiKuanTI! So I enter ship as Kuan Ti, and what I see? I see that our ship has active crew, many characters staying in lab with no skills - good sight, that means they are of higher level and are less likely to be inactive or griefers. Moreover I saw that many items has been already carried in right places and that there is little to no help that I could provide. Even shower was already taken care of I think... Maybe I am wrong, but... I think it was taken care of before I entered online <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> What I did? In such case I could do only two things - to push NERON projects a bit and to organize main disscusion a bit. As humman I managed (with crew) finish one NERON project before had to go offline. Now I think that was stupid decision of mine! Why? Because I used up some important AP that would come in handy very next day... Still, one project was finished (with help of crew) and it was time to organize Disscusion a bit.</p><p>Many ships has problems with high inactivity. This one seems to NOT have that problem. But just next to inactivity there are those who start active, and slowly decay into inactivity. I decided that best remedy for that will be to keep my Kuan Ti funny guy that will talk a lot and will make others laught <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So I started few important threads like "NERON Project", "Research" or my best creation "WTF is... Skill Theard?!" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> All of them had silly and serious description in it and... It did cought attention! Crew was pushed a bit towards activity and RPing. Not much, but a bit. Sometimes a bit can make all change <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Skills Thread was paticulary important. There I learned that we have Gold Jin Su and Raluca (and I was gold still). But what is more important - Janice posted something VERY funny for me and Jin Su <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> What did She posted?</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">wow! if you two will be our mushes than we are pretty much screwed already! beside that I am shrink and...l</span></span></p><p>Janice! Your words were so accurate! I made, as humman laughts at those! I was saying how unpropable that would be and how She should be more optimistic ^^ Soon... Very soon I had t stop laught from Janice... ^^</p><p>One more thing of big importance here - I and Ralulu (at same time) decided to start "Newbie Help" theard. I advice everybody to make sure that on Your ship there is one like that. When I look at forum I see "Inactivity this, inactivity that" posts. I agree - inactivity can be ugly and bad. But guess what? MAYBE! Just maybe if we will be supportive and nice towards newbies. Maybe if we will manage to get their attention into game. Maybe THAN inactivity will be not that bad? Maybe we will get more competent players around? Maybe we will help? Maybe we will fight inactivity insted of just constantly ranting about it? Remember - Your interactions with new players, how you treath them, how You help them or how you ignore them may and will have direct impact on future inactivity level on Your ships. Helping newbies is playing for Your team, no matter which team You are. Ignoring them is playing against Your own team - no matter which one it is. Because only real team that exist here is team of those who enjoy playing Mush with others. I did my part on that ship. I made sure that one out of three newbies got very good education, and I am sure that He will become in future great player. I also do believe that He will take my ideals of helping newbies and will be doing the same on His future ships. Good luck Stephen in future! I hope You will find better company than me <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>RALULU my love!!!</strong></p><p>As you know already, Eleesha and I knew eachother and were in private contact since begining of ship. However there was other crew member I liked very much! It was Raluca <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I decided that my TuttiKuanTi will try to conquer Her cold, antisocial heart... That led to plenty of funny dialog betwen me and Her... And later Eleesha was getting into it from time to time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I tried to lure Her into Nexus for date, I tried to invite Her into Engine Room for "romantic" PILGRED repairs... Everything what woman would love to get ^^ Exept Ralulu hated it all this time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I also put some jokes about making myself a hat from Cat's Fur <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> That provoked really funny reactions <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Ralulu! You were so much fun for me on that ship! Great fun! Tons of fun for me! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I wish so much to hear from You here! Please!!! ^^</p><p>But apart from RPing - anything practical? Well... Yes! It was Raluca who helped me most with that NERON Project that we managed to get completed before I was... Ehm... Enlightened ^^</p><p><strong>Goodnight Daedalus!</strong></p><p>After I spent most of my AP I just decided to take a bed and go sleep (in game and in RL). And here I made one of best decisions ever! I took a bed in "Shower Dorm!" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> In future it proved to be EXTREMLY helpfull! So I took that bed, said goodnight to whole ship and... And that was last time when I was seeing this ship and her crew with my humman eyes...</p>

Do the things we all normally do at morning <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> And at some point I decide to check on ship and spend AP just before I will have to go for some time. And what I see? What a beautifull message! No! Seriously! That simple message made half of my day. I quickly check Mush Chat to see who my partner is... And... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Janice! How did You knew? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Of course - my parthner was Jin Su! So... We have two Gold Mush Players! I know that I am High Level Mush... But Jin Su? Jin Su was Strateguru! That means He must be also very high lvl Mush, right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> What can stop us? I started to build in my imagination ship where only Chun is alive humman... And we keep Her alive inprisoned in one of Central Storages... ^^ Two high level Gold Mushes! Great start! Just great! And from previous day I knew that Jin Su is NOT going to be lowly active! I knew He will be of high activity for sure <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So I wrote to Jin Su only how glad I am that He will be my partner and that I ask Him to not do anything that would blow up His cover, and that I will be AFK for some time, but soon I will return... And I made some laughts from Janice <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And than what? Than I go AFK for 1,5 hour.</p><p>I return and what do I see? Jin repliad with making even more fun of Janice and Her ability to predict future <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Only after some good laught, we decided to start talking about our plans...</p><p><strong>Long term goal!</strong></p><p>I quickly described to Jin Su that I accept only thre ways of winning as Mush... No. That was said bad. I accept only three goals that I am willing to aim at when Mush. And those are:<br>a). total conversion<br>b). Sol infiltration (not by PILGRED rush, but by getting trust and really being infiltrator)<br>c). Eden invasion - not likely to happen</p><p>I described how I will not take part in anything else than those three (with adding that if situation is hopeless than I am willing to do rampage or something like that, just not going to plan for this from begining). And here great surprise came from Jin Su towards me. His reply?</p><p>Something like that: "Total conversion seems interesting. Finnaly I get partner that don't do early rampages!"</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Do not get me wrong! It is not that we excluded rampaging at all as an option! It was just last resort solution. But do not think that we were not ready! All this time we disscused which characters wil be most crusial to take out, where they are and where weapons can be hidden and which skills to pick up if still possible for best chaos and destruction! We just choose to not do this untill discovered.</span></p><p>I was like OMG! From very begining we agreed in most important thing - how we are going to win! We agred on that and by that we were glad to really cooperate with each other. So... Perfect condition for Mush Team, right? I mean... No problems at all, everything is crystal clear and generally nothing can stand in our way... This is how it looks so far, right?</p><p>NOPE! As Eleesha pointed out in Her story - there were ALWAYS problems. Each solution caused problem. Each problem led to elegant solution, and that again led to another problem...</p><p><strong>Early Problems...</strong></p><p>Believe it or not, but on our first day since being selected as Mush we stumbled on three separate problems. What those problems were?</p><p>Firstly - Jin Su was not that high lvl Mush as I imagined at begining ^^ Honestly He didn't even had Defacer <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> His top lvl skill was... Splashproof! This ment major setback for us. But worst thing was that there was NOTHING we could do about it actually <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It was a problem we had to live with <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I hoped that Jin will have Infector... Jin had only Splashproof ^^ Hahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Secondly - Eleesha! She was on this ship directly because of me... I jumped with Her here on purpose. Now I learned to be affraid of Her. She laready mentioned that Paola died and She had to become Comm Officer and had less time for Hunting Mushes... Guess what? It only made me more affraid of Her. Why? Earlier She was predictable. I knew I must watch my steep whole time. Now I had those windows of opportunity... But at same time if Elemele would suddenly decided to check logs somewhere... And She did talked to me about planning for it from time to time... Eleesha litelary was paralyzing me from doing anything - even extracting spores on my way from Nexus was true horror for me ^^ Silly? Maybe - but I know Sperbi, and I know that every mistake might get me killed with Him being Mush Hunter... Moreover, our Eleesha said She is only Tracker, but I knew that She was silver lvl 5 and was on top of possible ramage assasination targets as potential active Technican <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Lastly - I had bed in Shower Dorm. But Jin Su didn't! He needed a good excuse to get dirty - and there was no such excuse at all at begining. No hunters, so no need to eat. Litelary no way to get dirty in easy and beliveble way...</p><p>Solutions to our problems?</p><p>Jin's low Mush Level? - no solution for Jin's low lvl. That remained mitigated by infecting other crewmembers ^^</p><p>Active and expirienced Eleesha? - only one solution was accepted. Infection. At first daychange we debated who we should infect firstly. On one hand there was Ralulu who was Gold and could potentially help us greatly later in game. And in worst case scenario, insted of forcing us into rampage, She would offer bit more elegant solution - PILGRED Rush and return to Sol. But our (mine) fear of Eleesha was much greater. Jin obtained two spores, I took one free spore (Fertile) and we decided to infect Her on Day Change... Raluca's infection has been put on yet another daychange... Little we knew that this paticualr infection will NEVER actually happen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>No way getting dirty for Jin? - building Sofa was our solution. Jin Su set up Sofa and extracted two spores. Than He gently waited on bridge (after showering). He was waiting and giving Eleesha Logistic... But plan was already accepted and perfected!</p><p>However here I must say something important - Eleesha was not converted on first Day Change after Mush Selection. It happened on second daychange <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Why? Because first day was spent on extracting spores and watching when who is active, and when can we expect people to be sleeping, at work etc.</p><br><p>END OF PART ONE! Second part tommorow evening! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p><strong><em>3. Eleesha converted - story about betrayal, distraction and gambit...</em></strong><br><strong>Research activity</strong><br>So as You know/remember - I am Kuan Ti and I am Mush together with Jin Su. At some point (D3/4 change) we planned to expand our Mush Family by 1 person. Two candidates were Eleesha, who was on Bridge and Raluca that was in turret. We were affraid that going for Ralulu will mean that somebody will notice that there are dots in that turret and will just inform ship. Than Eleesha will easily discover who was there and that we stayed for cycle change and... That we are all Mushes together with Ralulu. So we decided that first must be converted Eleesha. We counted how much AP we need, and made sure that we will have bit more than needed. Rest of it - go for benefit of our ship!</p><p>So what did I made? I put all my NERON points into NERON Projects, and excessive amount of AP went into research. I went so hard for it, that I made sure that both baisic anti-mush research will be done (AGas and CSerum). I disscus that matter with Jin Su and we both agreed that it does not matter in our situation. I knew that Eleesha will be able to pick Mycelium Spirit and hence counter AGas. Three spores per day - that was all we really needed. Nothing more. I managed even to get Eleesha to help me in Lab at some point, and as She already described it - I took Her scooter, one that I never gave back (exept for very limited amount of time).</p><p>After making sure that Mush is crippled by research (NO! We were NOT!!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) I went back to my Dorm and lied down. There was nothing that was happening for whole this time when it comes to me. I just was lying in bed, grabing 2AP per cycle change and waiting for last minutes of C8 ^^</p><p><strong>Gambit with Frieda... Risking with Eleesha!</strong></p><p>Bridge was under camera and had 3 constant residents. Those were Eleesha (our target), Jin Su (my Mush partner) and Frieda (unwanted withness). That alone was not problematic. Really problematic was fact that Frieda's last activity moments were at very end of C1 or in middle of C2. In short - She had chance to notice defacer going on, or to notice that logs from 7 cycles are missing. And there was exacly NOTING we could do about that. Nothing at all. Our succes was hanging on whether She will come online, AND if She will, will She notice anything or not.</p><p>Another risk that we had to take was about Eleesha Herself. I knew Her! I knew person behind Her! And what? I knew that Sperbi will be vigilant, will be watching tracker map and will notice that suddenly somebody entered bridge... Not to mention being spiked under camera and defacer on very next cycle. What would happen if She would noticed? Propably nothing - we would managed to convert Her and that is it. But there was a chance that She would alarm whole ship, or just Chun, or run away and alarm everybody. So I decided that I will do something extra evile to disstract Her from Mush a bit ^^</p><p>As I and Jin Su were disscusing this plan and it's risks and possible rewards, I took my second and third skill for Mush: Splashproof and Defacer.</p><p>How our plan looked like? Very simple - C8 Jin Su spikes Eleesha (I stay in Dorm to get 2 AP), C1 Jin Su spikes Eleesha and I spike Her (Eleesha turned) and I take Anonymush, than I deface room logs. This is how it was all planned...</p><p>But for now there was still time...</p><p><strong>Eleesha converted! Distraction worked perfectly!</strong></p><p>So... Time was nearing... Spores were loaded, Jin Su active and Eleesha online &gt;.&lt; That was not good for us. Still I had distraction in plans! So... Around 3 minutes before Cycle change I sent to Sperbi looooooong and very special message! I knew that this message will gather His attention and most porpably will also provoke an answer <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> All was planned that He will be reading it, thinking about it and thinking about apropriate answer. Problem was that I could not check in any way whether it works or not. Of course I know NOW that it worked PERFECTLY as planned! But back than? No way telling! I just hoped it worked, or He was offline. Exept He was not - He wrote something in main disscusion few minutes before I send my "Distraction Message".</p><p>I quickly informed Jin Su that trap is set and soon eoungh I noticed in Mush Channel that Eleesha has been infected with one spore. Quckly! Refresh! Refresh! Refresh! Did She noticed? Will She allarm everybody? No? Yes? Cycle change... NOW! Refresh! Damn it! Few new messages... GOOD! All from NERON! No from Eleesha... Another spore inside of Eleesha! Fast! On bridge! On bridge! Come on! She will not read that message forever! Not sure if She even does it! Ok! I am on bridge! Infect! Infect! Faster! BOOM! Eleesha infected! She is Mush now! YAAAAAAY! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Defacer! Now! Defacer! Done! OMG! Anonymush! I must anonymush at once! WHAT? I CAN NOT?!</p><p>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!! Jin Su! Jin Su! You take Anonymush! I can not! Uffffff... Good Jin Su! You did it! Thanks... Let me rest a bit on bridge! My hands are shaking... OMG! OMG! So much stress for that... Never again... (actually few more times again ^^)...</p><p>So... Why could I not take Anonymush anymore? Answer is simple. My gold days ended. Right on that cycle change they ended! And I could not take finnal, fourth Mush Skill. Damn it!!! Now I knew that I will have to die at some point just to make sure that other Mushes will be able to live hidden... I didn't liked it, but was willing to accept that sacrafice...</p><p><strong>Frieda is blind! Kuan Ti lives! Hahahahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></strong></p><p>So I stayed few minutes on bridge, and when my hands stopped shaking I went nicely into Lab and worked on MycoAlarms and MycoScaner - both research again didn't mattered for Mushes. Why? We planned to infect as many people on board, which ment that we will be infecting under cameras and in other risky places. So it changed nothing... Exept we were not sure if it is safe to extract spores in Alarmed rooms or not... That was only annoyance though as we had plenty of rooms where Chun would be unable to protect with those. MScaner didn't mattered at all as we planned to infect our targets at same time with well coordinated attacks. So results would be always the same - zero spores. What would hurted us greatly is MBacteria! This would be deadly for us... Humman Team! Remember to not underestimate this little piece of research! Never-ever! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I done some research, posted about it, than went to Nexus to push project with my Neron Point, got relay from Stephen, who was idling there (Nexus was with camera!) and put another Neron Point... Got two relays from Raluca and than I went back to my dorm after extracting one free spore in RC. Stealth shower and bed! Good day? Very good day! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Yay! ^^ Nobody noticed that there was one more mush on board of their beautifull ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Le me add some comments regarding the distraction and the imminent situation after my conversion.<br>Firstly regarding the distraction: Evil, just evil! I won't tell the exact message, but I can show a comparison: It was like you are at a party, there is a woman, who is making mooneyes at you and when you are approaching her, the actual boyfriend is coming out of the hidden and beating you up.<br>That is surpassing even the trick <span class="tid_user tid_user_225811 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="225811">SummerMcLovin</span> was playing me once, I wonder whether he will read that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> (He faked to inject the mush serum into someone to make us believe we are mush-free, but instead the mush just took anonymush and lied to us-but that wasn't the trick I mean here. The trick was, that summer afterwards told in "Win thread" how awesome quick he was that he managed to inject the last mush with the serum! ).</p><p>Now shortly to the situation after conversion:<br>Kuan Ti used defacer at cycle 1, so... the whole cycle 1 no logs coudl be produced at bridge and the message <em>The archives are scambled. Someone was messing with the sensors.</em> (maybe a bit different, but similar) was visible.<br>So if anyone would have entered the bridge, we would have been done already I think...</p><p>But that didn't happen at cycle 1? Why? well... at beginning of the previous day I lost sol connection. Kuan Ti and Jin made very sure, that everyone helped me to establish the signal, so at that time no connection had to established anymore, only Frieda had a reason to be here... and luckily for us Frieda didn't show up at cycle 1.<br>I expected her to enter soon and therfore as soon as cycle 2 was starting I began to spam the logs a bit, so it is more difficlut to see that some cycles are missing. Just while I was in the middle of it..FRIEDA entered <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> ... But she didn't saw defacer, after scanning for a planet, she just left the bridge again.. So either she didn't lock at all into the log, or only very shortly ^^.</p><p>Also it was a good thing for Kuan, Jin and now also myself that Paola died, who is usually giving Frieda logistics point. But now I was comms officer without logistics and I think Kuan did tell Frieda to stay in dorms for accumulating aps...</p>

                <p><strong><em>4. Problems start to mount on us...</em></strong><br><strong>This is why we can not have Ralulu in our team!</strong><br>So we managed to infect Eleesha, while She was on bridge. Moreover, Frieda who came online cycle later conversion occured didn't noticed that there is very little logs on bridge. THAT WAS FIRST TURNING POINT OF THIS SHIP! Should Frieda noticed it and started an alarm, than it would be obvious that infection occured. It would be obvious that Eleesha got infected - because as Mush Hunter with power of printing THE LIST she was most valuable person that was standing there. Jin Su was not very pro-humman active, so it would be no brainer that He is Mush. And what about me? Sooner or later somebody would notice that Kuan Ti entered and exited FC twice... Bit strange as for person who went to Lab and came back, isn't it?</p><p>But Frieda didn't noticed it. And we could operate safely from now on <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Well... Relativly safely that is <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Eleesha was more than willing to join, and we three were capable to organize on any C7,8 or 1 to perform conversions. Sounds good, right? And it was good... For some time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now - You may ask what would happened if Frieda would noticed Defacer trick on bridge and alarmed whole ship about it... But nobody would take an action immidietly against us? Would that be really Mush loss? Actually - around an hour after Eleesha's conversion (and around 3 hours before Frieda came online) She noticed something interesting... WE COULD ALREADY WIN SHIP! There was trader that wanted to get one crewmember in exchange for PILGRED. What would we do? I go into storage, Eleesha sells me, Jin returns ship. Boring? BORING! Totally uninteresting outcome and absolutly not worthy being used unless forced. Dear Hummans! We could have get win already back than <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> We simply don't believe in such cheap win <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It would be just a bit more creative than boring rampage (I bet Gioele would do it! ^^).</p><p>At D4/5 change I wanted to get Raluca converted. Now that we had Eleesha, there was litelary nobody to catch us... Right? Well... Exept for Chun ^^ And Janice... And Gioele... And Raluca... Yea... Converting Raluca seemed for me to be our best bet. BUT! Eleesha pointed out an alternative. So... Paola was dead as inactive. From starvation. But there was one more inactive that was still alive - Terrence. Would it not be beautifull to convince crew that Terrence was inactive Mush? And... Guess what? We decided to go for it! So Raluca's conversion just got pushed by one more day. If I would only knew that it was "now or never" I would not agreed and would go for Ralulu. I bet Eleesha and Jin as well... But we didn't knew and went for Terrence. That was simple job. Stressless almost. We didn't knew that we lost last chance to convert Raluca... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Gold Mode again! Yay!</strong></p><p>Just moments before Terrence got converted, Eleesha send me MT Passes, so I could get Gold Days. Than I infected Terrence with finnal third spore and took Anonymush. Yay! After that I transfered gold days to Eleesha, and suddenly Mush side gained another gold player <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Now we were ready for anything... Or so we thought <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Rest of days went sillently with same routine for me - go online before going to work, check on what is happening, spend AP for hummans, and make sure everybody knows You just helped ship, go back to Your dorm and lie down untill You will back from work. Than spend some more AP for benefit of ship and calculate how much will You need for time of planned conversion... Boring routine, right? NOPE! It was not! Why? Because of Gioele...</p><p><strong>PRINT THE LIST! NOW!!! Gioele makes His moves...</strong></p><p>This whole time crew seemed to think that Mushes are inactive, or low level ones. They seemed to not see them as real danger. At least this is how it looked. But there was one exeption... There ALWAYS is, right? Gioele got himself food tested. He claimed to do it by mistake - which I actually DO believe. Never the less, He did foodtested and was comfirmed humman. At begining I was not affraid of Him, only affraid that He will set "an example" for few pro-foodtest crewmembers. THANK YOU ALL FOR NOT BEING LIKE THAT! Exeption was Janice - She ate few bananas... But Janice is Janice. That is only normal for Janice to eat bananas like crazy at some point. BTW - thank You Janice for ranting about me eating Your bananas <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I knew what I was doing! I knew that You will rant about that and inform everybody about that I am eating when starving <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Good girl! Good! ^^</p><p>So - Gioele got himself confirmed humman status. Later He got illnes and got comfirmed again. Nobody followed His trails (apart from Janice due to low morale), but He was more dangerous than anybody else on this ship was at that moment. He demanded that Eleesha will print The List. He also said that He will kill Eleesha if She will not. What Eleesha did?</p><p><strong>Eleesha playing with FIRE!!!</strong></p><p>Eleesha tried to delay printing The List, but Gioele was very determined. He was only crewmember that actually managed to see through things - He said in main disscusion that "Mushes are active, they are sporing and infecting people, and that there must be an anonymush already on a ship!" Eleesha "gave up" and did printed The List... It had my name on it! Yes! Kuan Ti was alpha Mush from The List <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Eleesha destroyed list in one of front turrets, than contacted Chun and informed about names on The List... Exept insted of Kuan Ti there was Derek name on <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> YES DEREK! THAT IS WHY YOU GOT KILLED REALLY! IT WAS MUSH PLOT! But not in instant - first things first.</p><p>Gioele was in Chun's hunters group. He knew names that Eleesha gave... But He refused to believe in those! He insisted on double-checking The List. And so He moved on Bridge and went inactive there for few cycles.</p><p>We had to convert Him. We needed to do it. We also planned to sell Terrence to traders for... For anything that there could be <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> We did put together those two things. (Just remember - when You sell Mush You can not use it's body for advancing research, so still no Pheromodem!) Why? Because in order to get Gioele converted we all needed to get one spore - I, Jin and Eleesha. So we all needed to get dirty somehow. I had bed in Shower Dorm - so no problem. As a matter of fact I had already my spore. Eleesha and Jin simply extracted theirs on bridge, than we all came there and in same time spiked Gioele. Boom! He become Mush and was not dangerous anymore <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Eleesha got Anonymush and we all were happy... Right?</p><p>NOPE! There came another problem...</p><p><strong>Newbie Stephe is observant!!!</strong></p><p>Just before Gioele got infected, and before Defacer got used Eleesha decided to give it a try to get Mush Genome Disk from Xylophs <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> If She would be succesfull, She would just pick Tech skill (remember - gold mode since Terrence got converted) and dismantled it. She was unsuccesfull at this... This time. Insted She hit Xyloph that broke connection to Sol. Jin Su immidietly helped and succesfully connected (or was it Eleesha? Don't know - not important) so that nobody will enter bridge. I was also ready to help with it just in case.</p><p>Later, after cycle has changed She simply sold Terrence for some fuel and it was decided that She and Jin Su will ferry it from Bridge to Engine Room (we had planet that needed 6 of fuel ready for expedition - we never get to that one!) and Fuel Tanks. Of course it was also decided that they will get dirty because of that and will need to shower <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> That is how we managed to "cover up" getting dirty on bridge. It worked like a charm... Untill Stephen entered Bridge &gt;.&lt;</p><p>Stephen was so eager to help with Sol Connection that He rushed to bridge when saw NERON Announcment about that. On His way to Bridge He did met Jin Su in a Front Corridor... AND NOTICED THAT HE WAS DIRTY!!! Jin Su was dirty BEFORE He even got to Rear Storage and long before reporting being dirty.</p><p>WTF? This is something that most players would not noticed! Meeting somebody in FC like that is unusual, and when happen most people would just pass by and went to Bridge. But not Stephen. Stephen just HAD to look at Jin Su's status... And noticed Him to be dirty.</p><p>What was lucky? Well... I was mentoring Him about game - AND I NEVER EVER LIED TO HIM ABOUT GAMEPLAY MECHANICKS! Whatever question He asked, I and Eleesha always answered honestly, as we both do believe that teaching new players is more important that winning or loosing this paticular ship we currently are on. And because I was mentoring Him, He choose to contact me insted of Chun. When I asked Him about reasons behind that - He just said that He don't have any proof and Chun would not believe Him anyway most propably. Ehh... What I could do? I told Him of few more reasons why Jin Su could be dirty at that point... Picking up fuel can make us dirty (later we discovered that Jin didn't picked up any fuel at all) and there was lot's of fuel on bridge from trade. Also later, when Eleesha was dead and comfirmed to be Mush, I suggested that She might use "Slimetrap" on Jin Su to make Him dirty and lynched so that Gioele (who was also by than killed and comfirmed to be Mush) would get command of ship.</p><p>STEPHEN! You made this very dangerous for our plans! I bet You got Your lesson here and next time You will not let such Mushes to run freely on Your ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Hard lesson that was, but most important - NEVER TRUST ANYBODY! By trusting me You actually lost chance to stop our advancment <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Should You tell about Jin Su to Chun, there was good chance that somebody would investigate Bridge closer and noticed lack of most logs... And things would go ugly for Mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So thank You for Your trust <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Still you put us into VERY hard situation, and we never were really sure if You believed my explenations or not...</p><p>And as for side note - NO! There was NO slimetrap at all <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>ALLRIGHT! MORE TOMMOROW EVENING! Have fun reading!!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>EDIT: And Sperbi is right - I did told Frieda to go to Dorm ^^</p>

                <p>Let me elaborate <span class="tid_user tid_user_8191292 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8191292">Europa</span>s last entry again.</p><p>Why we went for inactive Terrence?<br>Well, that was hard decision, but we saw that Paola died already of starvation, so we wouldn't have much time anymore until he could die maybe too...<br>also converting Terrence and selling him soon for traders should give us much benefits we thought... a) it doesn't unlock advanced antimush research<br>b) it is giving the humans the feeling, that mush team isn't able to do much damage, especially with the big amount of research, which was already done. <br>c) most riskless and eaiest way of conversion (Terrence was only one room away from me and in a turret, which won't be entered soon, right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>So I expected, that humans would just make sure Terrence is mush and then be relieved, think about a nice situation with no mush danger. And so we decided to go for him, that worked perfectly.</p><br><p>But, like already said, suddenly Gioele wanted me to print <strong>The LIST</strong>. I was very unhappy about it, told even about good arguments why not doing it (no confirmation possible anymore, whether ship mush.free). Actually I thought that would be enough to convince him, but he was still persistent.<br>And so I did what he requested, but not how he imagined it I think <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.<br>Firstly I printed it with the hope to have Terrence on it and since there shoudl have been still many names on it. I printed it and picked it up, before reading... And here I had bad luck.<br>So I will reveal now the real list, which was printed:<br><span class="tid_sideNote">At the very least one of them were an agent of Mush when we fled Xyloph. I'd bet my life on it... Frieda , Gioele , Roland , Kuan Ti and Chun . But which one... <br></span><br>Aaargh, no Terrence! But Kuan Ti on it... I didn't want to throw him under the bus, especially since at that time Jin and Kuan Ti had anonymush, while I was still without anonymush.<br>Therefore I destryed list in a turret (and used even defacer <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">). Then I told Chun about the results, just that I changed some names ^^. I had 2 options: either with Terrence on it... or with no mush at all on it.. <br>Now I want to add, that I thought I couldn't get away with it forever and probabyl die at one point. My plan was already to get the mush disk with xyloph and dismantle it before dieing (I knew, that at least Kuan Ti would always play for his team and instantly reveal the whole mush team, if human team woudl have been able to cure him, as I would do too!) so I only had to give us more time. And if human team is hunting in the wrong direction and killing innocent people...actually it woudl amuse me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Also I noticed that Chun is rarely online, so what did I do?<br>I only invited Chun, and told her the results of a <strong>fake</strong> list, in main chat I said only that Chun is informed:<br><span class="tid_sideNote">At the very least one of them were an agent of Mush when we fled Xyloph. I'd bet my life on it... Ian , Gioele , Frieda , Derek and Chun</span><br>Ian was already dead at that point, Gioele confirmed human, Chun always human, so...they should kill Derek, who was acting suspiciously like hell without much hesitation, while after that they would probably hesitate before killing Frieda.</p><p>Well..I coudl have foreseen it, Gioele was complaining much, that I didn't invite him into the private chat as well (and Chun didn't too since she wasn't active that often <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>Ok, I slept for the night in RL... and after awaking I was confronted with a dificult situation:<br>1) Chun came online in meantime and did invite all people she trusted to see result of my list, but she also said, she woudl trust me too <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. people in mush hunt channel were Chun, me, Gioele, Janice and some hours later Raluca too. Also she wanted to prepare killing Derek and coordinate it, nice! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>2) Gioele didn't want just to believe me. He just came to bridge and waited that I would hand over the list.</p><p>Now problem was, if I would have spoken with Jin about current situation and preparation of converting him at bridge, I feared that my online status would have been switched to "online" or soon to "recently". But I wanted to pretend to be inactive...)<br>So I contacted <span class="tid_user tid_user_8191292 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8191292">Europa</span> via Twin pm about my problem, she would be needed for infection anyway. Well, she was at work, so Jin did thought I turned inactive and didn't know about my problem and why Gioele is at bridge and why I don't communicate with him anymore <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Therfore conversion of Gioele was a cycle later then actually planned, luckily it went still somehow well..<br>But here I made a mistake: I contacted xyloph before using defacer, so announcement of sol interruption was visible, but afterwards I was instantly able to reconnect with first try, yeah! Got mush disk with second try and had enough time to spike Gioele, dismantle the disk sneakily (got dirty &gt;.&lt; ) , and extract another free spore (since i am already dirty, why not ^^-also that spore was essential later ^^), Kuan Ti and Jin did spike Gioele too and he was converted before day change was happening in next seconds. YAY!</p><p>But Stephen came instantly to bridge after cycle change, becaue he thougt it is still necessary to connect to sol then.. he could have noticed the defacing, me AND Jin dirty at bridge...but luckily he left room afterwards and did only notice Jin su dirty in Front corridor when Jin was leaving bridge.<br>I took opportuinity to trade terrence now, we got fuel and I was moving 6 capsules to Rear alpha storage-enough excuse to get dirty, right? While Jin went down to load fuel for a planet, which Frieda found a while ago.</p><p>At that point I thought all our problems were mostly solved and it would take them time before they notice me as mush, enough time to get Raluca I thought... How wrong I was...but you will hear that story later I guess ^^</p>

But.... wait, actually, I am not sorry. I should have trusted neither you nor Kuan Ti! Stupid me! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"><br> <br>Anyways, reason for trusting Kuan Ti more than you was.... quite unjustified, in retrospect. I saw Kuan Ti pushing projects and research so often while I had no idea what you did. Well, I did not consider that Kuan Ti gets free project advancing from his designer skill back then. And I did not consider that it is actually very normal for a mush hunter to, well, not be seen pushing projects and research....</p><p>I did not notice anything when I went to the bridge. I went there to get the signal back up, and when I arrived, that was already taken care of. So... I felt pretty stupid that moment, thinking that I should have waited a few minutes, because now I wasted MP for nothing. And while feeling stupid, I did something even more stupid: I ran out of there without checking ANYTHING "so that no one sees me &amp; and my mistake". NEVER AGAIN will I enter and leave a room without at least having a short look at the logs! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"><br>After I ran to the bridge like an idiot and then rushed out like an even bigger idiot, I finally managed to calm down while standing alone in the front corridor. But, wait, what was that? I am not alone? That guy wearing black and red... what was he called again? Let's see... oh!<br>Well, that's how that happened.<br>You already know what happened afterwards. I contacted Kuan Ti and he told me of some possibilities why Jin Su could have been dirty without being a mush. First possibility was picking up fuel - that I managed to refute few cycles later. Second possibilty was slimetrap - that I believed for the rest of the game.</p><p>Now I'm really interested in hearing what Eleesha's big mistake was. The thing is... what would have happened if she had not made that mistake? The whole reason I let Jin Su off the hook was that <span class="tid_wspoil">I was made to believe that <strong>Eleesha, who died as a mush shortly after that incident</strong>, used Slimetrap.

                <p><strong><em>5. Eleesha dead! Long live Janice!</em></strong><br><strong>Stephen cryzis...</strong></p><p>So... As You might remember, I (Kuan Ti) with my co-alpha Jin Su and our Beta Eleesha had to convert Gioele, so He will stop making us problems about The List. Actually converting Him ment comfirmed humman to be in our ranks... And it let us to influence Chun's Mush Hunt even more with now TWO "mandates" insted of only one... Win? WIN! And it worked nicely, exept that Stephen came in and saw Jin Su being dirty in Front Corridor.</p><p>Thanksfully Stephen contacted me, not Chun about it, and I made nice explains on how Jin Su could get dirty while on bridge (at that point only theory was that He was dirty from picking up fuel that we got from selling Terrence). This was of course not true - He extracted spore for Gioele's conversion <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So I managed to convince Stephen that Jin is not a Mush really. Exept I also asked Stephen (I tried to be TOO humman I guess) to go on bridge and check if Jin was picking up fuel actually. Problem was - NO HE DID NOT! And I had no idea about that! I was sure that He did! But He didn't! So I knew that we have some cycles till Stephen will notice truth. Still - that ment also that we have some more time to prepear ourself, to think of possible countermeasures and to do something. Also keep in mind that we managed to dodge The List Bullet just few minutes ago... We needed that time to reorganize and set up new plan...</p><p><strong>Operation - STEPHEN MUST BE TAKEN CARE OFF!</strong></p><p>Here we had three major plans as for what to do with Stephen.</p><p>First plan assumed simply talking Stephen off again with some reasoning. Seriously - that would be best case! To simply find out reasonable reasons on why Jin Su got dirty and to make Stephen (and not only Stephen if such need would arose) believe that. Problem with that plan was that it was as easy plan as hard to make true. Why? Because there was litelary NO way Jin Su could get dirty on bridge without leaving marks in Logs... Exept for Slimetrap! But that would mean somebody else there is Mush... So... Not going to work.</p><p>Second plan was to simply convert Stephen. This plan was disscused all over again and again. I and Eleesha - we both really wanted to do that... However there were good reasons on why we should not actually! Reasons strong eoungh to make me hesitate and pick third option at some point... What those reasons were? Personally I was affraid that Stephen may not have yet Anonymush unlocked (since Gioele was online at diffrent time than we were, we could not trust on Him picking it - we must have trust Stephen to do so insted) and we would have to waste precious time for Him to unlock it and than pick it... Time that is so crusial when trying to hide conversion going on with Anonymush. Another good reason that Jin Su pointed out was that even if Stephen is good newbie (and You were VERY GOOD newbie - now you are not newbie anymore - You are "kind of newbie" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> ) than there is no telling how He would react on being converted... And He pointed out His long list of expirience with newbies being converted... Negative list that is. That was something we could not actually ignore. While I did not liked it - I had to agree that converting Stephen should be considered more risky than converting other characters... Hey! Also keep in mind that He was Bronze - it would be better to use that chance to get Raluca who was gold... ^^</p><p>Third option was to simply kill Stephen in such way that people will believe that Derek is our Alpha Mush... This is where Eleesha shined by forming grand plan on how to put this in place... It would require Gioele, Jin Su and me to coordinate nicely with Her overseeing us. I will not get into details... Eleesha! That is Your place to explain how things would work... I will only say shortly that it would require use of transfer (Gioele), Defacer (Kuan Ti) and mission from Jin Su for Derek. With all this it would be possible to get rid of Derek and Stephen (and at cost of loosing "only" Gioele). Plan was accepted by me initially - but later proven to be not necessary...</p><p><strong>Gioele not that cooperative... Stephe goes inactive!</strong></p><p>When Gioele come online He congratulated our trio on getting Him converted and on winning this ship already. He was good sport and helped as much as He was willing. He sabotaged Chun's Mush Hunt by comfirming Eleesha's List. He made sure that Derek got killed and made sure that Frieda will be another suspect. But in same time, He was very tempted to rampage or directly sabotage ship - options we did not wanted to actually happen! We went for total conversion, not rampage/sabotage. And so, He was not comfortable with our plans, claiming that they were too complicated, hard to coordinate (note - He was propably in diffrent situation than our trio and could not spend too much time online to actually make it happen) and generally "way too convoluted" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Good news was that Stephen had some important things going on, and had to go offline! That ment one more day for us to convert Him, or think of something <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Great! Just wonderfull! I could also say that I saw Him eating twice - that would do it as well, since it would become irrelewant why He got dirty in first place <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> So we felt happy about things - and about having more time for everything... Plan to kill Stephen was never executed. I think it was partly not executed as none of us really pushed Gioele for that one... And that was mostly because we really wanted to have Him converted... Just not at that time...</p><p><strong>Eleesha's mistake... Janice joins winning team!</strong></p><p>So... Things were going on calmly... Days passed... Ok, not days, but one day. Stephen was rarely comming online - to put His AP on some good work and that was it. I assured Him that I and Eleesha are observing Jin Su very closely and will take actions if any irregularieties will happen. He seemed to be happy with that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I hope that You are still happy about that trust You showed into me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It did payed off after all, didn't it? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> BEST LESSON EVER - do not trust anybody exept Chun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> But what if You are Chun? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Hahahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway - time moved on and we had to start plan for another conversion... With Derek being killed and comfirmed humman after that, there was only one name on The List that could have contain Mush - it was Frieda. So we needed to convert Frieda in order to make Her die from the hand of Chun... Alternatively we could convert Ralulu and THAT with Her help we would get Frieda... Which we choose? NOTHING! Why? Eleesha did GREAT mistake ^^ Hahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In a middle of my and Jin's disscusion She wanted to object converting Frieda in favor of Raluca. Problem was... SHE DID SO ON WRONG CHANNEL!!! So... Insted of sending message to us, She did so to Mush Hunt Channel <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Our reaction? I had absolutly no second thoughts of what our plan for now is - calmly I stated that now we go convert Janice (Mush Hunter, comfirmed humman), than after Day Change we do same with Ralulu (Mush Hunter) and as soon as Gioele comes online, He kills Chun (leader of mush hunt, comfirmed humman). Why like that? Simple! Janice was rather active person, and it was not obvious when She will be online next, but surely She would be online anymoment now. So She needed to be converted first! Than Ralulu right after daychange - She should still be offline by than... Only one left of Mush Hunters would be Chun, and Gioele by killing Her would ensure that there is absolutly NO MUSH HUNTERS on ship! That mistake of Eleesha could have been actually force that would require us to move from totall defeat into total vicotory... I presented this plan to Jin and Eleesha, and both have agreed on it. So... Nobody voting against? Unfortunatly for us - Janice voted against... And She did so VERY quickly...</p><p>You see... THAT IS WHY WE CAN NOT HAVE NICE THINGS! Janice was online as this all happened! And while I was presenting my plans to Eleesha and Jin Su, She simply came on Bridge and started attack Eleesha.</p><p>Eleesha showed that She is actually cold blooded and very calculated. She could have run away back than. Insted She choose to extract spore and infect Janice with it. Than She defaced Bridge. And than She died... Good Bay Janice...</p><p>Jin Su did same - extracted spore and infected Her somewhere in FC. So we landed two spores properly on Her... Only my was missing...</p><p>But where Janice went from Front Corridor? I actually went through half of ship looking for Her only to get info from Jin Su that She is... Standing on bridge! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now things got easy - I just came in, infected Her and went back to Dorm. Janice was our! Unfortunatly Eleesha was dead... And with Her we lost also our Mycelium Spirit. That ment only 2 spores per day... So from now on we went on VERY slowly... Gioele could helped us, but... But there will be another part of my story about that... You will see yet what happened <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As for Janice... I will only tell for now that She was very quick to pick up Anonymush... And was surprised to see that there were 3 other Mushes on board... And She was excited to take Eleesha's place...</p><p>END FOR TODAY! MORE TOMMOROW! Anybody who would like to add something, explain a bit or point out to me where I got things wrong are welcomed to do so! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

We've made a draft plan what we are going to do. The 1st thing in the plan was "Don't worry - we have enough time - no need to rush things". A little later we decided to go for Eleesha. (That was already described earlier but let me summarize the plan). <br><span class="tid_sideNote">1. I go to the bridge, get dirty "<em>building the sofa</em>"<br>2.

Then the &lt;&lt;&lt;good advertisement words go here&gt;&gt;&gt; Kuan Ti saw that I screwed! Came fast and gave her another cookie. And this time it worked! That Kuan Ti should be really charming. They they pulled down my advertisements from the TV (Eleesha ate all the cookies we had, and if someone else wanted to get some - they would have to wait) (Dammit... I put so much effort to look good on the cameras...). After making Eleesha join the <em>Dark Side</em>... Kuan Ti made me join a group too... I can't remember the name, but it's motto was <cite>We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us.</cite>What an influential person! They told me that some people on the ship might not like Darth Vader and I had to hide my costume in the shower cabin.</p><p>That motto made me remember something!

This is where Eleesha shined by forming grand plan on how to put this in place... It would require Gioele, Jin Su and me to coordinate nicely with Her overseeing us. I will not get into details... Eleesha! That is Your place to explain how things would work...</cite><p>Ok, plan was not too complicated, but would have solved our problems too: At that time Derek was still alive and main suspect of mush hunter because of my faked list. I would go to the dorm, Derek was in, use defacer and Gioele should just shower himself to low health, transfer into Derek and Derek would kill Gioele's old body and kill Stephen afterwards, maybe with help of Jin's mission if necessary.<br>Then people woudl have thought Gioele was human, which woudl have made even myself, Eleesha, more trustworthy since a human Gioele would have confimed my list ^^, Stephen would have been no problem anymore and the mush hunter would kill the "already known mush" Derek.<br>Sorry Stephen, but we were afraid of you!</p><p>That plan didn't happen in the end..why? because Gioele was inactive at the planned time and afterwards Chun did kill Derek already...<br>Afterwards Stephen also told us about his absence and problems to enter game with his mobile phone, so that plan to kill Stephen was just dropped ^^</p><p>Now to my <em>"Great Mistake"</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Well, the current situation first: confirmed human Gioele was in mush hunter team, myself too, Derek was killed, but Frieda still alive.<br>Myself and Gioele coudl convince the humans to research and use serum on her, especially since we had still Raluca with Genius. Just that this research wasn't actually possible anymore since I had dismantled mush disk already sneakily ^^-but humans didn't know that ^^.<br>My plan was now just to delay it as much as possible before humans would found out that I am mush and use the time to help converting as much people as possible.<br>And I think we would have been possible to delay it at least a day more... I could have told that I haven't decoded all xyloph dbases yet and after some time I could have "remembered" that a "friend" told me, that it is actually not possible to cure Frieda since a traded muhs (Terrence) doesn't unlock that research! So they would have still to kill her, who knows, what we would have been able to accomplish...<br>but then...<br>my stupid mistake happened <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br>I think I did just read in mush hunt channel, then I thought! that I changed to mush private channel, did even read their discussion and wanted write my opinion...and somehow what I did write I entered into the mush hunt channel! Aaargh! Such a damned mistake, such a shame! <br>At least I informed instantly my mush team about my mistake, no second to late... while Kuan Ti did write about going for Janice first, she was actually already moving to bridge and did hit me!<br>When I noticed it, I was already at 5 hp! Then I did flee to a turret, in turret I had only 3 hp! and now I did think shortly... I could have gone to medlab and heal me, but...I am revealed anyway and my team is active now, so... in next second I returned to bridge, spiked Janice, used defacer and... died! - without any death message in main chat because of defacer... That was good too, since Kuan Ti did run like crazy before giving Janice the final infection and had then an excuse that he just wanted to look where someone was killed sneakily. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And here it is time for a big thank you to my mush team! Jin! you did instantly spike Janice without hesitation after my first spiking, awesome, Jin - especially since you had to read, that my message in muhs hunt channel would reveal you as mush probably too! And Kuan Ti! Though maybe because of panic you thought that Janice did take off ^^, you were quickly at bridge, after Jin told you about her presence there and finished the job nicely! <br>At first glance it seemed that after my mistake our whole mushy mission would fail...but now.. <strong>now there was hope</strong>, especially since Janice was a previously confirmed human, who did now even kill a mush, the perfect mush infiltrator! And so I died somehow in peace ^^.<br>I was only worried about Jin now, as Kuan Ti and Jin too... but it went somehow different then expected <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Read the message by yourself, I did post unfortunately in mush hunt channel, before the story will continue tomorrow:<br><span class="tid_sideNote">But but..we benefit from Jin, I will miss his logistics! why should he suddenly use a bed, he didn't do that the whole time, suspicious! ^^ also i don't think it is nice idea to get Frieda. when jin is going to adorm there has to be log of him entering there. i would approve it nly if we get Raluca at cycle 8, then get the next day Frieda after Raluca awaked and is able to take anonymush then.</span></p>

                <p>Oh! Yea! I remember my panick that Janice changed NERON Settings and just run away in Patroller! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Hahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Jin Su tried to inform me about Her being at bridge few times! I didn't noticed it somehow many times! Chat looked like that:</p><p>Kuan Ti: She is not in Nexus!</p><p>Jin Su: She is at brige!</p><p>Kuan Ti: OMG! She went to Alpha Bay!</p><p>Jin Su: AT BRIDGE!!!</p><p>Kuan Ti: I think She just left in Patroller...</p><p>Jin Su: SHE! IS! AT! BRIDGE!</p><p>Kuan Ti: Yes... She propably just changed NERON Settings and run away after killing Eleesha...</p><p>Kuan Ti: At bridge? I am on my way!</p><p>So... I also was not able to simply count down how many patrollers we have to determine if She run away in one of them or not ^^ Funny about how many things person don't think when is in state of even slight panick <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Hahahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong><em>6. Ending is nearing...</em></strong><br><strong>Ralulu dies... Gioele dies... Mush Free? ^^</strong></p><p>I will not say what happened to Jin Su following Eleesha's misplaced message! You just read it, and think about how You do understand that message <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Than look in amusment how it also can be understand <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Tommorow Eleesha will explain everything, and You will all see <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So... Somehow Jin Su survived that without any harm <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And I also! And Janice was with us! And we still had Gioele among us. But we could no longer convert 1 humman per day. Now we could convert 2 hummans every 3 days... Only way to get Ralulu converted was to ask Gioele to take Mycelium Spirit and together with Him convert Raluca after Day Change. That didn't happened.</p><p>Gioele lost patience with us and our "way too convoluted plans" and - with my permision, He just faked Last Mush On Board Rampage <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> He went into Shower Dorm and attacked Chun many times. Than when short on AP he went to Rear Alpha Storage and infected Raluca with one spore... After that He transfered into Her and killed Her old body. After some time I went there in order to "investigate" and called people that Gioele was killed by Raluca... But Raluca seems to be with diffrent skills so there must have been a rampage. Jin Su came to help, and soon we killed Gioele in Raluca's body. Since than we were believed by everybody to be completly Mush Free Ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>PILGRED is up!</strong></p><p>After Gioele's and Raluca's death, our ship had only two actives Techincans... One was me - TuttiKuanTi <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Another one was Chun, who did read Technican MageBook. Together (but mostly I) repaired PILGRED, and by doing so we managed to comfirm two things. Firstly that Hummans REALLY think they are Mush Free - they would never allowed PILGRED to be set up if they would not trusted in that. Secondly, we comfirmed that we are true winners as there was not much hummans could do now to stop us from Returning Sol in case of being discovered <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Sure they could - it was just not an easy task for them <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Just keep in mind how well hidden was our Janice ^^ Comfirmed humman that killed one Mush by Herself <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Additionally soon Frieda died out of starvation - so now there was half of crew still alive... That is 8 characters were still alive... 3 of them were Mushes <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> If I only had Mycelium Spirit... But I hadn't! Ralulu propably would have it... But She was long and gone... And honestly that is my mistake I regret mostly! I should have NEVER allow Gioele to do that with Raluca! I should ask Him to do so with Roland! And who knows - with Roland's Shooter points, He actually might be able to off Chun in faked rampage? But... Things were done and gone forever. We had to "drill" our new situation best way we could!</p><p><strong>Our plan? Infect one more time!</strong></p><p>We put very simple plan for now. To wait two more days in order to accumulate 6 spores... And on end of D10 and begining of D11 convert our two pilots - Hua and Roland. After that infestation we wanted to go Sol and see reactions of our crew on that they had Mush crew for whole this time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I paticulary was most interested in seeing Stephen's reaction <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>STEPHEN! I had so big hopes for conversation like this:</p><p>Stephen: Kuan Ti! We have new Mushes on board! Look at Comrades Bar!</p><p>Kuan Ti: I see Stephen... That is... Pity... Really pity <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> No! Seriously I am concerned by that... Why don't You go and just drink some tea? Hmm? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Don't worry... Everything will be allright <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In other way - I hoped that just before ship will end, I will be able to tell You how for this whole time You trusted wrong guy! How I was standing behind every single action against hummanity and how I was hidding it from You ^^ And enjoyed Your trust ^^ BUT ALSO how my whole tips about game was always honest, no matter how it could hurt me and my team in process <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I would have enjoyes such conversation <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Very much I would <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Oh yes! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Problems never end... </strong></p><p>Did our problems ended? Of course not! Just when we thought that we are safe and nicely hidden Andie took posision of Comm Officer and... PRINTED XYLOPH LIST!</p><p>Pff! And what of that? - You might ask now... Well! I tell You what of that! Out of everybody on that list it DID COMFIRMED ELEESHA TO BE BETA MUSH! That is right! It comfirmed that Eleesha was NOT alpha Mush... And that sole belief was MOST IMPORTANT PART OF OUR PLAN! That hummans will believe that Eleesha and Terrence were Alpha Mushes and Gioele was infected somehow at some point (remember He was comfirmed humman). Good that Jin Su was fast and just took it before Andie managed to read it... Good that Andie keept silent about that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Hahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> She didn't cared propably. Because why would She? It is Mush Free ship, right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Another problem was Hua suddenly reminding Herself about missions! Yes! D8 and She suddenly asks question: Actually... Where did all missions went Jin Su? &gt;.&lt; OMG! Imagine how we felt!</p><p>And on D10 Hua suddenly reminded Herself that Coffe is generated each cycle and we should drink it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Great! That was death sentence for Jin if He would be asked to drink it few cycles in row!</p><p>So... Problems, problems and one more time problems <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> We never run out of them...</p><p>END OF STORY FOR TODAY! I will finish tommorow <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I will put than ending and what went wrong and what went ok when we were dealing with our last problems <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Janice here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>yeah... you 2 sneaky evil masterminds were the mush dream team come true - active as hell, golden, knowledgeable AND sophisticated, it was almost unfair to team you 2 up - you were by far the most active from the whole crew</p><p>nevertheless... i wouldve never suspected JuanTi since he has been relaying research and neron like crazy, the glorious leader however was getting more and more suspicious doing nothing...</p><p>and BTW... seems like i couldve prolonged my human career... maybe even save myself completely: after i saw eleeshas mistake i ran to the bridge (btw - i checked the logs later - it took JuanTi 1 minute to scream that i am on the move - thats how active these guys were), eleeshas first instinct was to run away but i followed her from the bridge to front corridor (after scoring a couple of hits) but then she turned back and went to the bridge (at this point i noticed kuanti running around FC so i started to suspect something fishy is going on with him too - he didnt ask anything even after eleesha died despite being obviously active, he mustve at least noticed me trying to kill eleesha)</p><p>on the bridge i finished eleesha (thankfully i had a ration with me - otherwise she wouldve still lived) and saw JuanTi enter bridge...</p><p>now a moment to explain eleeshas little misshap: she wrote on the mush channel that (paraphrasing) "they would miss the advantage of jinsu's logistics if he went to Adorm", the style of the message was composed as if jinsu wasnt a part of the conversation, so i assumed they will use him for a transfer and to convert frieda or raluca<br>THEY meant eleesha AND somebody else (little did i know at that time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> )</p><p>so... after killing eleesha and seeing jinsu dirty on the bridge all i was left with was 2 MP... i thought the 2nd mush transfered into jinsu so i ran to front alpha turrent and waited there for like 5 minutes trying to make up my mind...</p><p>checking back the mush logs was hilarious <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> kuanti backtracked my steps from Adorm and thought i went to alpha bay... and as he then passed one of the turrents he mustve seen my icon on one of the turrets and panicked even more - thinking i was outside in a patrol ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>after thinking stuff through i thought ill just lie down on the sofa on the bridge and regroup a little... so i went back jinsu noticed, let JuanTi know... and the rest is history <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>also - to explain everyone, who will read this whole story, why the human team barely stood a chance - most of the humans logged in twice-three times each day... opposed to the mush who were all ACTIVE eg. - the very moment when i went and killed eleesha, trust me, i wasted no time, it couldnt have taken more than 3-4 minutes and in that little time all 3 mushes were actively responding to my actions - 2 of them spiking me within that brief period and KuanTi finishing me after a frantic search for a couple of minutes later - at the same time the human part of the crew was in a dreamy state oblivious to anything i wrote on the mush hunt channel and/or the fact that we got a dead eleesha mush, and what it implies <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>awesome game though</p>

Great to hear from You Janice <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Honestly - fact that we were THAT active at that time when You killed Elemele was very much coincidence <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I don't remember which day of week that was, but I was actually logging in exacly twice a day... At my early morning, before going to work and after returning from <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Point is - once logged on, I always stayed on without long breakes untill sleep. And I was checking on situation regullary... Jin Su was working normally with computers, so He was online nearly 24h per day!!! Hahahahahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And played... Wait for it... INACTIVE!!!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> HAHAHAHAHAHAHA <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And another advantage was that we all were living in simmilar time zones (Jin Su had only 1 hour diffrence - irrelevant most of time). Should that happen few hours earlier and... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But it didn't <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I am also glad to hear how You had laught from seeing me freack out that You run away in Patroller <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> But honestly I have no idea how could I think such thing right than <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Still - I did and that was really funny <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Now when I remind myself of it ^^ Lots of laughts! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_8565377 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8565377">Soroosh</span> - nice to hear that I guess <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Just watch out...
