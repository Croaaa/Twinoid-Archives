                <p>Lessons Learned:</p><p>1) Mush hunting matters on nearly full ships. Don't do suspicious things like walk into dorms with showers.<br>2) Spore extraction doesn't (often?) make you sick, any only <em>might</em> make you dirty, but it will take 3 health every time<br>3) If you're about to be assassinated for being suspected of mush, the best thing for your future life prospects is for the real mush to throw a grenade in the room and run off with the med kit, provided you are at 7 health or higher.<br>4) Spreadsheets can save your life<br>5) Gioele puts his cameras in shower-rooms for a <em>reason</em> - and it might not have to do with Mush<br>6) Don't put all your alien artifacts in one room - you might loose both your liquid maps in a fire, for instance<br>7) Healers and Diplomats are important people in a long game - and so are techs and Astrophysicists <br>8 ) General Patch-Up is actually super good research if you're planning on keeping your ship for a long time<br>9) Caffeine addict + Pilgred repaired = WIN<br>10) No matter what, you can't beat an active Roland for glory<br>11) You really can talk to much, but it's a group effort. To many messages will eventually lag down the game to a crawl.<br>12) Kuan Ti is super fun to RP. Women want him, men want to be him - and want him. (At least in his mind, as I RP <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> ) And he loves his ship!<br>13) Yes Jin, the big red button needs the "extention" in the engine room to make the ship go <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"><br>14) I got to see what the calculator looks like!<br>15) I didn't know sofas could break.

                <p>The lag thing happened to everyone. The game slows to a crawl when there are 6 favorited threads with 100-200 posts each. We actually cleared everything twice to get rid of the lag. Our health thread reached version 3 before we decided to just screw it and use a spreadsheet. When half the crew gets injured every cycle, it's really hard to track who's injured, who's healed, who's in need of help, and where everyone is in real time. The lag meant that these small bits of communication took several minutes.</p><p>And when there's only 2 females left, Frieda starts to look pretty damn good. Part of the appeal of Eden was in repopulating the new world. If we had more cigars and more ladies, we would have kept going a few more days.</p>

                <p>Come on, let's make this a proper rehashing thread!

(this is my first time playing detective as an experienced mush player -- all the times before I was new to the game, or was alpha mush myself xD)<br><br>I had no idea what came over me, but for some reason, the first thing I did was to <em>ban</em> people from entering Medlab &amp; Bravo Dorm (it's the one with the only shower)! I didn't mean to take such an iron-fisted approach, hahaha. It just...happened!<br><br>It helped me split the crew into two groups:<br><br>1. People who had the chance to shower, in secret or otherwise<br><br>2. People who never had access to the shower, or a room with a shower...ever.<br><br><strong>Group 1's</strong> movements were tightly restricted. No access to Engine Rooms. No access to Laboratory. No access to Medlab. Etc. I kept track of everyone who "cross paths" outside camera rooms, too.<br><br><strong>Group 2's</strong> movements only requirement was to always use an Apron in anything that could make them dirty, and to never, ever, enter Bravo Dorm.<br><br>Yup. I know. I put the ship on total lock down. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

They are pretty great game designers, but it's clear that technical perfection isn't their primary objective (or they just don't think it's worth the time investment to do better, so they might just be good businessmen on top of being good game designers). Any programmer who thinks it's an insult for someone to point out they did something poorly isn't particularly cut out to be a programmer. As a programmer myself, you will <em>always</em> end up doing something poorly.

Later, I hear that right before the Spore Sucker test that some people were afraid that Eleesha's reign of terror was a cover-up for Mush and were set to assassinate her, only she passed the Spore Sucker test before they acted. (She also very narrowly missed being turned into Mush, by lucky accident). Ian and especially I failed the Spore test (both human) but before I could be assassinated, Hua threw a grenade into the room, nearly killing us but actually ending the testing and stalling assassination plans. After Chao was caught and killed maybe a day later, Sagittaeri used mad dictatorial &amp; Spreedsheet skills to prove that there were not enough spores around turn anyone Mush and saved my skin. I believe that she's written a paper on this and has sumbitted it to the Twinoid scholarly journal, and it's currently undergoing peer review.

Crazyness. No rebellions against your tyrranical rule or anything? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></cite><p>We non-mush were happy with some organization, but there was a stage where it got<em> too far</em>. Like when Janice logged out in the Rear Corridor, Eleesha made us go around via the Engine Room route to get to Icarus. Jin Su averted that madness by dropping a mycoalarm in RC. It was also fishy that she was entering some rooms (like Bravo Dorm, which had the shower) <em>when she had no reason to do so</em>.</p><p>Frieda was the first to openly speak out against Eleesha and demanded her way into the mush hunting group, which I think had Jin Su, Paola, Chun, Eleesha at that stage. Chun wasn't too active at the start of the game so we formed other groups since she couldn't communicate between them.</p><p>We cleared Jin Su as human because he never got dirty. Paola and me (Gioele) were cleared because we seemed to get AP from food and coffee. I got pilot from a magebook and was doing a good job with the hunters. Paola was doing a good job with comms, getting every single rebel base. No way she could be mush. We did get suspicious of Hua because she never shot down any hunters (pilots watch each other closely) and she was lying in Bravo bed all the time. But Hua attacked us before we could act.</p><p>We discussed possibilities for mush plans, specifically what if Eleesha was mush. Eleesha was eager to do food tests and spore sucking... a little too eager. I got the hunch that Sagittaeri was playing Eleesha, and Sagittaeri was clearly an Eleesha mush in a past life so we figured that he would have some high level mush skills, like Transfer (yeah I know this is a little meta and a long shot but I was right about the player lol). Somehow we settled on the idea that during the spore sucker test, <em>she'd transfer into someone who was cleared by the spore sucker</em>.</p><p>I had access to bravo dorm and refectory and was tracking down the people who came in to eat and possibly shower. Eleesha and Hua were outstanding among Bravo Dorm visitors. We didn't even spot Chao (the second alpha) there; he spored before we dismantled Alpha Dorm showers.</p><p>Eleesha at the point was <em>refusing to print the tabulatrix</em> list and Jin Su said she never brought up that skill so it looked fishy. We tried to pressure her into printing it before assassinating her. Paola managed to convince us to wait until the spore sucker test and until she printed the list. Funny enough, Eleesha and Hua were both on that list.</p><p>Hua was the second highest suspect and earlier said she got dirty while fixing the BIOS with Eleesha. Why would we get a pilot to fix something? <em>Why would Eleesha do a technician's job when we had two techs?</em> We suspected some kind of collaboration between the two.</p><p>I think it was day 4 C5 around that time. I get offline at C7-C8. Paola was assigned to be the first gunner. I had Solid skill and would come in to finish the job at D5C1 using coffee AP to boost if needed. We were about to dismantle Lizaro Jungle to get the second sofa at the time, but I told Terrence and Raluca to hold off because of possible mush.</p><p>If Eleesha had suddenly attacked someone and gone silent, we would've suspected a transfer and hold off on killing Eleesha. But she was nice and got through it cleanly. We then suspected Kuan Ti because he was freaking out about the tests but Hua and Chao exposed themselves before we could kill him.</p><br><p>The mush actually got 3 spores on Eleesha by Day 5. Ian got one from a trapped shelf that was meant for her too. Very impressive considering that Eleesha never stayed in a room without a camera. If she didn't suck that second spore out, she would've become mush. Mad respect for Hua for doing well under that kind of pressure. If Hua had been a little more patient, we would've killed a lot more humans, converted some, and I doubt we'd get to day 12. And we'd have an experienced mush Eleesha leading the mush side against the rest of the team.</p>

                <p>Hahaha you're making me sound like the most suspicious person on the ship! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In my defense, Chun &amp; Jin Su were in my original mush-hunting secret channel, but Chun wasn't responsive enough (or at all) to defend my actions, and Jin Su got all paranoid on me and (I later found out) turned against me and only pointed out all the things I did he thinks was suspicious. Conveniently, he left out all the things I've done to hunt for mush, like how I've <em>saved all the logs and shared them in spreadsheets</em> in the mush hunting channel, and how much time I spent digging though them! As if a mush would do that!</p><p>Chun being absent forced me to look suspicious myself, because initially I couldn't really trust anyone, so I had to hide the Hacker Kit from possible mush takeover (I did share its location to mush-hunting channel). I had to do a lot of things in secret, like hide Mycoalarms in non-specified rooms, because Chun wouldn't do it, which ups my suspiciousness.</p><p>Jin Su being suspicious of me was quite a blow to me, hehe, because he was the ONLY contact on the other super secret mush channel that I wasn't on, and thus could be the only one to testify on my genuine mush-hunting activity...except he chose to cherry pick all the suspicious stuffs instead. Not only that, my Tabulatrix plans (and other mush-hunting plans) were all shared in my TWO mush-hunting channels, too...I dunno why no one jumped on my defense...<img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> I'm so glad I didn't get killed!

                <p>Ah, where to start on the post mush hunting part? It was fun and frustration , mostly fun though. We had all the remaining 14 crew alive till Day 14 or so, which was a big thing in our progress.</p><p>We started actively exploring planets around Day 9 (I think?) and usually averaged 1 or 2 planets per day since. Our first focus was to get artifacts and when we got a Int Life x3 planet, we jumped into it.</p><p>The funny thing was that we never knew we had a BP: Babel Module <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">. We were so meticulous with our inventory that it was a big surprise we missed it. Kuan Ti (Delzoup) once mentioned in chat that we should carry Babel Module and we all made fun of him, calling him crazy and that he was hallucinating. Poor Kuan Ti, he started believing that he was crazy.</p><p>Anyway, we explored couple of planets without Babel and in the first expedition we got the Magellan Liquid Map. Of course we got excited and then suddenly Raluca announces that she saw a Babel Module BP lying in a turret room. We were all like :fp .</p><p>It was then that we found our first Starmap in a Shipwreck, I guess. We got super excited (we also lost the Compass in that expedition but that didn't affect us so much after we got starmap). Without any further ado, we started working on the Calculator research (by this time, we had completed most useful research and were just focusing on expedition)</p><p>There were a lot of expeditions after that, Once, we saw an awesome planet with Int Life x3, Cristallite and Shipwreck but it also had Seismic <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"> We decided to take the risk anyway (against Sagittaeri's protest). Anyway, the Babel Module was not useful at all and we got all combat or nothing to report in the expedition, but then we didnt lose anyone to Seismic either.</p><p>After some time we got another Int Life x 3 and we were sure we would get a startmap here. As fate would have it, we lost the Babel Module in the first INt Life <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico">. Well, that was the beginning of our frustration. We found the second Starmap around Day 14 however on a Cristallite.</p><p>It was around the time that the ship started falling apart. Every cycle, there was a fire or something broken or room falling. We spend truckloads of AP on healing each other. So, we had 4 astrophysicists exploring, couple of tech fixing things and the rest on healing. Some were more active than others.</p><p>We had got a good collection of artifacts after all the subsequent expeditions - 2 Magellan Liquid Maps, 1 Alien Opener, 2 Alien Holographic TV, 2 Rolling Boulders, 2 Jar of Alien Oil (which we used as fuel).</p><p>Our first death was on Day 15 when Raluca died. We had a spreadsheet tracking health but the lesser active people never updated them and they were the ones who started dropping one by one. Meanwhile, we found a lot of Cristallite planets to explore but we never got the third Starmap. Everything was either combat or mush trap. 7-8 straight Cristallite was really unlucky.</p><p>In one of the expedition, we also lost Gioele (Mr Muz) . Gioele was our star member - Caffeine Junkie with Pilot - insta hunter clearer. So, we were gutted when he was lost. However, we found him later when we explored the planet again. (And, that is the reference to the subject line of this thread <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>What broke the straw in the camel's back was when Jin Su died on an expedition. It was really unlucky. He started out good but then all the damage was either max or focused on him. That's when we decided that we will try out final planet and call it quits. We were just 9 left and it was nearing Christmas and we were spending nearly all our AP on healing and when we didn't find a Starmap in our next expedition, we just quit it and returned to Sol.</p><p>D18C6 - the end of our wonderful journey.</p>

We survived so much together. I can't believe no one died until Day 14...we had a grenade thrown at us (after Ian &amp; Kuan Ti used spore-sucker multiple times too, along with many others), we had Chao going on a rampage by emptying his clip on Frieda before mutating and punching Eleesha (again), and we had lots of alien fights in our expeditions. Not to mention the assasiination plan against Eleesha and the short moment where <em>everyone</em> thought Kuan Ti was mush because he failed spore-sucker test. XD</p><p>Many conversations were incredibly amusing, as well.

                <p>Here we go with the experience of being mush on this ship.</p><br><p>At the beginning when the ship was not full yet I was very happy with the MMM because the ship was very active and it seemed like it will a very good ship.<br>Well and then the last crew member joined and I was chosen to become a mush... I did really curse the RNG for spoiling this ship for me :/ I prefer being the good guy and then I have to become mush on such an active ship.</p><p>I was really excited because I did not want to make a mistake because I thought that they will notice it immediately with so much activity. My heart was pounding and then I decided to act fast because I thought that I won’t have got much time until everything will be watched very closely.<br>So I went to the rear corridor, extracted 2 spores (all the time hoping that no one will enter the corridor while I'm doing so) and then I hurried into the alpha dorm and showered, luckily no one saw me and so I was lying in alpha dorm and thinking about my further steps.</p><p>My partner was Chao and he was not that experienced but I invited him to join the IRC chat so that we can discuss our actions.<br>I advised him that he should also extract 2 spores very fast before one shower will be dismantled. At this time there were 2 people in the alpha dorm I think it were Stephen and me. So I told him to extract the 2 spores in the rear corridor and then enter the AD and shower very fast so that the other person will not see that he was dirty.<br>He did also manage to extract the 2 spores and remain hidden.</p><p>So we stayed in the AD and shortly after this the antispore gas was finished and the shower in AD was dismantled by Terrence. Chao did some research and it happened that he was alone with Finola in the Lab (no cam) and so he infected her once. It was around 2 am by this time in my country so I went to bed.<br>At the next day Eleesha has announced very many rules like stay away from the shower and never enter a room without a good reason and so on. At this point it was obvious that this will be a very hard game for the mush. I became very discouraged because everyone was that active and there were so many rules to prevent the mush from succeeding.<br>This was the first time that I realized how hard it’s actually to be a mush on an active ship. All my former ships have been rather inactive and so it was very easy for the mush to win because the most of the ships would have died anyway after ~6day even without the mush.</p><p>So I created a plan to sabotage this ship very early because I did not think that we have got another chance. Since my partner was Chao I decided that I should throw a grenade in a room with many people and Jin Su (there are always many people in the dorms so this should be easy). I planned to kill Jin Su and try to kill also other people but the main goal was Jin Su. Then Chao would be assigned as the commander and so he could ditch an expo later.<br>But when I thought again about this plan I did not like it anymore because yeah it's just noob mush tactic because you don’t need any skill to kill a few people and even ditching an expo is quite easy if you are the commander. So I decided to scrap this plan and just try to convert as many people as possible because this would be more fun than just killing some people and ruining their and also my game.</p><p>I played along and acted like a human and when Frieda attacked Eleesha (in the chat^^) because of some fishy things I contacted her privately to gain her trust and to make Eleesha a bit more suspicious. I managed to receive her trust and later she invited Eleesha to the chat and although she was suspecting she did not do anything because Frieda trusted me. So I was part of one of the mush hunting channel of the ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Eleesha (Sagittaeri) knew my identity in the IRC chat and so we did also talk there. I waited for a good opportunity to infect something but it was very hard because everything was watched very closely. But because our BIOS was broken (no sabotage, just broke randomly) and a drone did not manage to repair it for a few cycles I managed to get a chance to infect Eleesha.<br>Since she was lvl4 Eleesha she had a skill that would boost her efficiency for reparing if she fails. We did not know how high the bonus actually was and so we wanted to test it. So I offered to try to repair the BIOS and then we could compare our chances before and after the first try. I was a bronze player and for this opportunity I choose the trapper skill.<br>So I trapped the shelving unit in the rear corridor and the shelving unit in the nexus. In te rear corridor there were some gloves and I told her to pick them up because I did hurt myself (that was actually true <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) by trying to repair the BIOS and in the nexus there was the wrench. Everything went smooth and now Eleesha was spored 2 times.<br>I did thought about taking the 25% chance (observer skill) and just infect her on the way back from the nexus but then I decided to wait for another opportunity.</p><p>Eleesha had the scooter because she was checking all the room logs. So I asked her to borrow it to me because I should walk to the bridge to establish contact to SOL. I got the scooter and I should deposit it in the front corridor for her. So I dropped the scooter and trapped the room. Then I went back to the dorm and hoped that she would be converted. But then Ian went through the front corridor and picked up something else and got the spore &gt;.&lt; so my chance was gone although it has been so close.</p><p>At the next day they decided to do the spore sucker test on everyone (they thought that humans will always get dirty by using it and mushs can’t use it). I did not like this test (well ofc since I was mush and it’s a totally reliable test whether someone is mush). They did gather up in the medlab and since there was also a bit confusion because the test was not always working (there is only a chance to become dirty by using the sucker, no 100%) and the sucker did also hurt them everytime for 3 HP I decided to take the grenade and to throw it in the medlab. Unfortunately nobody was killed (although some people were really low on health) and then I grabbed the medkit and took off in pasiphae.<br>They discussed what to do and since the pasiphae does not land when you move the ship with the magnetic net but stays in orbit they decided to ditch me and the pasiphae/medkit.<br>I used my time in the pasiphae to explain my opinion regarding those mush tests and that they ruin the game. Everybody complains about mush who are just killing some people and then take off in pasiphae but I told them that in my opinion those tests are just as bad as those fast killing tactics.</p><p>Well later I returned so that they can kill me (I would have died anyway because they would just have ditched me) because I did not want to take their medkit away with such a tactic.</p><br><p>So now you know the story from the mush side <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>It really sounds like you should have just finished turning Eleesha and you'd have been in much better chance. Totally worth a 25% chance to be detected to get a gold convert, esp. when that convert is the one doing a lot of the work holding the ship together!</p>

He wasn't being rude when he talked about mush tests being lame. The entire ship agreed with him, anway. Spore Sucker was a lame thing to do, and we'll never do it again. In fact, after the first time trying it, we never did it again, not even to prove that Beta Mush don't exist. We returned to traditional investigative work after that.</p><p>As for returning the Medikit...well I don't see how flying off in the Pasiphae with an important item a valid mush tactic, and I think he believed that, too. He's dead either way since we're already planning to abandon him, and he doesn't want to stain his record by using underhanded and cheap mush tactics. So, he came back, and decided to end it the honourable mush way, as if he never tried using such tactics in the first place. I understand his point of view, so personally, I don't believe he did anything wrong.</p><p>Anyway, I also understand that it's not my call. I'm not seeking a debate with anyone...just to explain my position on this peacefully. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>It would have been a very different game if Eleesha was converted. I think Hua/blubberflash threw away some nice opportunities there. She could have stolen the spore sucker and mush sample instead to give her partner some space (especially since she was already in the lab). If she had spores, she and Chao could have finished the conversion of Eleesha during that time... that hit while in the Nexus was a really smart move. Chao exposed himself though, by spiking Eleesha while she was under the mycoalarm.</p><p>The event actually made a lot of us reconsider the spore sucker test. It sucks in many ways (pun intended), but it was not foolproof. We would never have caught Chao with it and chances are we wouldn't have caught Hua either. Heck, we almost killed Kuan Ti because of it even though it cleared Eleesha. I'd probably discourage mush tests in the future. It has its charms, but the downside is that a lot of people just don't like them. And when others are not having fun, it ruins the fun for me as well.</p><p>I think the warning was probably due to the "no surrender" rule. It sounds like it was just a warning not a sanction, so must have been in the gray area between the two. I'll vouch that blubberflash was definitely not being abusive.</p>

                <p>I'm always trying to be nice in the chat and I think that everybody from my former ships can confirm this <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>I'm discussing it with the mod group in a message, I did not want to create a discussion about this here, sry :o</p><br><p>And regarding spiking Eleesha, afterwards its easier to say, that I should have taken the 25% chance, but as I said I hoped for a better chance (it was very close with the scooter). And well after the spore sucker was used I think that the mush did not have got any chance anymore to convert someone secretly.<br>It was also before the spore sucker test very hard for me to be mush, my HP were very low (I was bronze player and choose trapper, so no phagocyte) and from showering and hurting myself by different tasks I was at 7 HP. My ap were also very low because mush do not get any ap from eating and showering without soap does also cost 2 ap and extracting a spore did cost 4 ap.<br>I had used my last spore for infecting the front corridor but unfortunately ian picked something up there :/<br>And at the next day Eleesha did use the spore sucker and so she did not even still have got 2 spores. So I think that I really did not have got any chance anymore to convert someone secretly.</p>
