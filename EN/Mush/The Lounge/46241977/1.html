Terrence was killed and was mush.</p><p>The second mush defaced Bravo Dorm, the only dorm with a shower. Who could that be. From memory, Hua, Frieda, Jin Su, Janice and Chao were all in bravo dorm. Ian had come and gone (showered - supposedly from gardening without the apron but was late reporting this) according to Eleesha's logs of Bravo Bay. Frieda was first to raise the alarm in the main channel. Chao was unreachable, but had reported something out of order and had fixed it. One of those people was alpha mush. Chao had shooter, among other skills, but the blaster was still in rear corridor and another in storage (according to trading console).</p><p>Frieda had spent all her ap the previous day scanning for planets, and should have been at full ap yet she stayed in bravo dorm in bed for a couple more cycles. Then, when she did get to the bridge, she did one analysis of a planet. She also had pilot yet there were hunters outside. Where did her ap go?</p><p>Meanwhile, Chao picks up the blaster and heads to the laboratory where Ian is. It appeared he was doing nothing when I came in to borrow apron. I tried to whisper to him but he was unreachable. A medic carried out surgery on him and found he had Smashed Arms and Damaged Ears. So, the victim of a grenade attack. The grenade had been left on the shelf in Bravo Dorm.</p><p>Discussions were taking place in a private channel. My first suspects were Ian and Chao. Why would a Mush Ian vote for extra hydropots and also take Green Thumb? Chao was the one who found the mush sample. He had shooter - surely with shooter points he could do more damage... Terrence had shooter but used his fists, so perhaps no real logic to it, but it was a consideration. However, when Frieda turned up to the bridge a couple of cycles after being full of ap barely doing anything (not even resetting research after being "happy" with a planet fully analysed with cristalite....), my suspicion turned to her and I convinced those in the mush hunt it was her, 99.9% sure. The commander killed her and indeed she was mush. Eleesha then said she could not print the list.</p><p>Paola here. I did my best with comms, 5 Neron upgrades (CPU, LPS, Aux Terminal, Mag. Net, and GPU). Starter magebook was Medic and that went to Eleesha. Comms magebooks were shooter (for Jin Su) and Astro (went to my caffeine junkie father). Kuan Ti also eventually levelled up taking Astrophysicist.</p><p>Planets were scanned, expeditions happened. We had full o2 at one point, and then fuel. Starter alien fruit was jumpkin so we had loads of plants at the end. However, we couldn't find any starmap fragments. We had 2 jars of alien oil, and a circuit jelly but Finola our medical diplomat couldn't persuade the alien life to give us a starmap. The final straw came on the last planet, d11c7 when Jin Su went missing off-piste. C8 Hua launched the rescue mission. I decided to join that rescue mission and was so saddened to see Jin Su under that rock, I got overwhelmed with agoraphobia. The first human to die on the ship.</p><p>Start of d12, Stephen died from injuries. A new player who didn't quite know what he was doing, but he did no harm. Finola is still dirty from the expo and I was at 8 or 9 morale. I had a few panic attacks in earlier cycles so thought it would be time to propose returning to Sol. Jin Su was an excellent commander and pilot, also had Strateguru.</p><p>Fires, here, fires there, fires to put out at 93%. Room shakes, steel plates, electrical spikes, ouch lots of ouches. Daddy died in a combination of earlier roomshakes, another shake (or was it spike), and fire.</p><p>We could have carried on, but with the RNG against us, how many more would die? I like to think a return to sol means you can regroup, find additional crew and try again to take Chun to Eden. Meanwhile, Sol Botanic Gardens can have some alien fruit trees.</p>

                <p>I was surprised to find out that the ship already ended considering you still had a lot going for you. Then I found out in the end page that Gioele burned, so that certainly hurt chances of going to Eden.</p>

                <p>Perhaps we could have continued on for longer. We lost you not only as a pilot, but as a Strateguru. Even though we had the shield and good hull..... Maybe with better coordination. I noticed only afterwards Gioele had reported 8hp health and a few cycles later, room event plus fire took him out. With only a core of really actives.... and perhaps uncertainty by some as to what to do, and looked like a few panic attacks amongst the crew.</p>

We had great chance of Eden but in the end we got very bad streak of luck which killed two key players, Gioele with his coffee perk was our main planet scanner (burnt) and our Esteemed Commander Jin Su being Stratguru/shooter(book)/,Pilot/Logistics/Leader getting lost and being found dead on the planet.</p><p>After their deaths we had 3 what I would call cycles of death at one point I was reduced to 2 health from 16 hp steel-plated, room shake and Electrical spike was crazy also had Gravity simulator break two cycles In a row. I think yeah we could of carried on but with key players like myself and Paola due to go Inactive do to things In real life its, likely only thing that would of happened was more people dying.</p><p>I have to say was a shame Terrence just attacking me from the start after mush selection because Frieda was very good as a mush and if weren't for Sherlock Paola "Usually 1st person to say crime has been committed is always a possible suspect". something on those lines would of never guessed it was her, Thanks for ship was pleasure being your <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> maybe next time I can save my nose and reach Eden with you who nose!</p>
