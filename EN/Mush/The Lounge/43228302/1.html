We were on D8 with 89 hull, 4 active pilots (3 with shooter), 10 banana plants and a very active Ian... good on morale, had a diplomat, active caffeine junkie, two dead mush and one cured, only two inactives. All that was good, but the reason this was a great ship was the crew. I really enjoyed every one of you who was active and talkative.</p><p>I'm really sad the relationship (or lack thereof!) between Stephen and Paola didn't get to unfold. Terrence was all set to tell Stephen 'That sucks, man, but I did try to warn you...' and looking forward to maybe getting a companion in his pessimism. He'd actually sent Paola a message basically telling her not to phunk with Stephen's heart if she wasn't sincere, because, after all, he liked the guy, even if he was a naive fool.</p><p>The teasing with Roland was a delight, and I'd have loved to have seen how the fledgling animosity Terrence was now harboring for Ian would have played out! Also had plans to start PM'ing with Janice and hint more at Terrence's crush on her, despite his jaded advice to Stephen that pretty young women didn't go for men like them and love was a trap.</p><p>Would have loved to have interacted more with Derek, Raluca, Paola and Gioele as well. You all seemed really fun.</p><p>I know there were a few other TE on the ship, not sure who was and wasn't, but I'd love to ship together with most of you again regardless. Hopefully we can make that happen! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Janice here. <br>So this was a TE ship? No wonder... I thought it was just an obscenely good random ship. Anyway, not really sure what else to say... Would've abused my position as Neron admin more but I was in the middle of finals week for the majority of the ship. <br>And Terrence was flirting in the chat, you say? I caught a bit of that once or twice, but wasn't sure what to do about it, so I just kinda decided to ignore it. I was figuring I could do some stuff with Neron if it ever really became obvious. I was kind of playing Janice as well-meaning, but not entirely sure what's going on all the time... Was I successful?</p>

We could have gone far and beyond, but we ended up at Sol for an early leave. A shame my banana plants where for naught in the end - even though someone at least enjoyed the vanilla flavoured bananas, so it seems.</p><p>It was a well organized crew, and a lot of things could have happened. I was pretty sure the mush thread was eliminated (and it was) and I could then concentrate on rather pressing matters. After having pressed research - and even gone so far as hiding mycoalarms in almost every room (well, plus or minus a few here and there) I was ready to take the more important matters into my very hands. Naming all the trees, for example, was the top priority task. And then telling the crew about it. In all its very detail. Also I thought about painting the Laboratory pinkish, just so it would be the highlight of the ship - thus dragging people out of - and keeping them away from my sacred gardens.</p><p>I too would have loved to see the fledgeling relationship between Paola and Stephen to grow and mature, as the trees did in the wonderfully well vested garden. I never got to know what happened to the single Dandelion I gave him to pursue his romantic affair. what a shame. Stephen, you were a well of joy to read and react to. All the other actives, too, of course, but I've never had such a funny Stephen to accompany my travels. I might steal that. Heh.</p><p>Terrainy, I was literally just writing a response to your rather vicious grumbling, but then it all ended all too soon. As you I would have loved to see where our little "discussion" was going - it was not the way to candy land, that I can tell! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Y'all who talked were fun to play with. Well, with the exception of Frieda, especially after reading her end statement - but the rest of you I hail indeed.</p><p>All in all, one of the more fun ships to be a part of - but for the tragedy that was its sudden end. Ophelia still complains about a certain someone puking on her, however.</p>
