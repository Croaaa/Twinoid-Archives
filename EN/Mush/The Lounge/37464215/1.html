You may have been a cleared human but that was no right to attack anyone you suspected.<br><br>Anyway, I was not a "Über Autocrat", you attacked Hua and gave bad justification, all I did was say that you should play with the team and doing otherwise was going to get you killed. Chao warned all of us of that type of play was not going to fly.<br>Then when we started fighting I made my points that you wasted our time, you said that if she was a greifer/mush she would attack, she did but only a stupid mush would fall for that, I was sided with. I never ordered your death or forced anyone into things, I only stated my points and repeated what we had already been told by Chao. Anyway you quit on us because we (me and Chao) didn't side with you on attacking Hua. Should not have wasted my ap saving you.<br><br>As for the others, my somewhat rude demeanor when I had my requests for details on Pilgred ignored twice was more misdirected anger on Terrance and suspicion on Raluca who went silent almost right after my request.<br><br>Anyway that stuff aside, our last day for those not there, we are waiting to do an expedition, then Roland messaged me clearing himself via food test. We are low on o2 but decide to do the planet we are on. The plan was I or Paola would pick up the hack kit and protect it, and that we maybe kill Jin Su since he woke up recently.<br><br>Anyway, Roland got impatient, droped his iTrackie after telling people they had 18 minutes to get to the bay for the expo. <br><br>So people rushed, and since I had not been able to get the hack kit as planned Paola took it. This was our doom, as she was mush. We had some suspicion but we didn't have much expect bad comms work.<br>So soon as they leave, I don't know who, know Roland, Chao, Frieda, Gioele maybe Stephan, are left behind.<br><br>Right after that Paola taunts us, then is seen infecting Jin by Finola who went to kill her, we knew he wasn't mush since he never left the bridge and Janice and I correctly guessed she had transferred into him. So Finola wastes her ap attacking Paola and Jin leaves for the engine room afterwards. Round that time we are figuring our what to do, Ian wakes up, so we quickly tell him not to attack Paola.<br><br>We planned to attack Jin once we could but random panic attacks meant ap and mp was spent getting drugs and rations ect. So Janice wastes her ap keeping me alive and I vow to do everything in my power to kill Jin at least, but then we return to Sol.<br><br>Jin and Raluca had pilgred rushed while we were unable to do anything. So good job mush, if we had been more organized and just gave up the slim chance of all 3 star map pieces at once then maybe we could have lived.<br><br>Learned a fair amount, mush can only infect for so long, being a cleared human makes some people think they have some sort of shield protecting them from their actions repercussions, and that Chun should always hold the hacker kit if active enough. (Not that that makes much difference, Paola would just have transferred into Jin and flew off anyway)<br><br>So if you feel like it come by, if not meh, just wanted to clear some stuff up and explain what happened for Chao ect. Also interested in hearing what others have to say about it I guess. Hope to see some of you the games, Janice, Chao, heck even Roland, Paola and Finola, but hope I never meet Terrance again for as long as I play, was an average (for me and my limited play time) Chao player.</p>
