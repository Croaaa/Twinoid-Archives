                <p>I was Stephen on this ship:</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/539" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/539</a></p><p>This was my second ship and I had a great time and learned a lot. We had a few inactives and some other interesting things to deal with. Here is how the things played out from my perspective:</p><p>Chao was active but never spoke and I had noticed that he dropped the apron in a weird spot without telling anyone, and then he picked up the armor and blaster without telling anyone. I called him out in chat about it, but I don’t think he ever talked aside from the initial hello. I thought for sure he was mush.</p><p>A few days in Finola contacted me about taking out Chao. I was a little hesitant as I had never seen him dirty. But Finola really wanted to do it so I went along. I had been speaking with Ian since early on. For some reason I trusted him from the beginning, not sure why, I just got the feeling he was safe. Ian and Chun were brought in and we formed a little cabal and set about planning to kill Chao.</p><p>Chao’s pattern at this point had been to slowly travel around the ship moving every cycle or two. At the time we had the ap and equipment to kill him he happened to come in to the central corridor. Finola and I went in. I had the knife and we each were carrying food in case we needed additional AP. We knew he would be tough to kill with the armor on. The plan was that I would use the knife then drop it for Finola. If Chao came online and counter attacked, Ian would come to us or we would go to him for protection from his pacifist.</p><p>We took down Chao pretty easy. I was able to do it with my ap and eating. But he turned out not to be a mush to my horror.</p><p>The person I really suspected at that point was Frieda as I had called her out for being dirty a day earlier and she hadn’t responded, was still dirty, and I had seen her up and about. I also noticed that she had cooked and eaten 3 times in two days and was suspicious that she was trying to use that as a cover for spore production.</p><p>So I suggested to the group that we take her out. Frieda was sleeping in one of the dorms and Finola goes in a takes her out. She also turns out not to be a mush. At this point Im feeling terrible about what I have done.</p><p>I post in chat explaining that I killed Chao and Frieda because I thought they were mush.</p><p>Shortly after all this Chun goes into the lab and says Hua is in there using the console. Then says that she notices Hua is dirty after picking up the cat, and asks if it’s possible to get dirty from the cat. We respond that we don’t know. Chun says she is suspicious of Hua. Then Chun drops out of private chat and we get the message from neron that Chun has been assassinated.</p><p>I think for sure we are dealing with a mastermind mush who is taking advantage of the situation and trying and make it look like I killed Chun, and I think it’s got to be Hua based on what Chun was saying right before she was killed. I tell Eleesha and a few others that I didn’t kill Chun, but I was talking to Chun when she died and have a suspicion of who did it. I tell her to check the lab log and tell me what it says.</p><p>It turned out that Janice, who had been inactive up to that point, became active and decided to murder Chun before going inactive again. Finola kills Janice and we discover that Janice is not a mush either. Great, so the one person I know I can trust has been killed by a griefer. At this point I am scratching my head and have no clue who the mush could be.</p><p>I still feel bad about killing innocents and don’t want to make that mistake again so I just go about my business the next few days.</p><p>One mush turned out to be the inactive Jin Su, and the second turned out to be Roland. Once Roland was outed we had a fun little game of cat a mouse for a few cycles as he was leaving the ship in patrol craft to escape us. He kept sneaking back into the ship while we were trying to kill the aracks so we could leave him behind. Eventually we were able to and we even collided with him on our way out <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>After that it was death by depression and hunters. We did have some good expeditions though.</p><p>Finola, at one point Ian and me were really close to killing you. After we had been wrong about Chao I thought you might be a mush trying to manipulate me. We also thought you were trying to use “doing it” as an infection vector cause it seemed like every cycle you were saying “come to the dorm and take down the camera and do it with me” haha you dirty girl. Glad we showed restraint in the end. At one point in Eleesha list thread you typed “paranoia crois they’re after me…” What was the deal with that message it made me suspicious of you?</p><p>All in all in was a fun ship and I got some good experience. I would like to thank everyone that was active, and very sorry to Frieda and Chao. But in the end after talking with Roland, Frieda had been one he was working to convert so I guess maybe it was clairvoyance.</p><p>And Special thanks to Paola for teaching, guiding, and being patient with us less experienced players.</p><p>I hope to serve on a ship with you all again.</p>
