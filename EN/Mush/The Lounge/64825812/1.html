                <p><em>An account of how one Eleesha started off as the spirited leader of a mush hunt...and ended as a Mush Mastermind.</em></p><p>I woke up on Day 4 with Chao already starved to death, and mush awakening only moments later. As Eleesha, my role was straightforward, advance that mush research, boost projects, and keep a watchful gaze on anyone and everyone.</p><p>Research was advancing very slowly, partly due to our Finola having gone inactive in IB following an expo. Projects weren't much better off, with a seemingly newbie Kuan Ti. I tried to give a hand in both while fulfilling my investigator duties, but that was difficult to accomplish without a scooter. And thus, the first mystery I took on was the <em>Case of the Missing Scooter</em>.</p><p>I feared the crew was slowly falling inactive. I had Stephen copy Finola's Medic skill before she passed. I tried to guide Gioele in a newbie channel with Terrence and KT, but he never really communicated, and spent all his time standing in a turret and shooting down hunters and/or transporters. Needless to say Gioele didn't last long, though it took two men's efforts to bring him down in the end.</p><p>Roland was particularly excited about the mush hunt, and assisted in creating a confirmed human channel. Unfortunately he wasn't really cut out for the investigation business, as the first person he confirmed was Ian, whom he had purportedly seen double eating. He also claimed I am human on account of having seen me double eat (I hadn't, I asked for 2 bananas but didn't actually eat 2. I was nonetheless human at this point).</p><p>Our Paola had been lazy and ineffective, and also inexplicably dirty. While the humans discussed Paola as our mush suspect, she infected the cat and spored some crew. It is unclear to me what her perceived mistake was, but one of her actions led her to think we were going to kill her. In an effort to hinder us, she transferred into Roland, therein forcing us to kill our Pilot/Shooter/Firefighter and disabling us in the face of future enemies. It is worth noting that Raoland (as her new name was decided), threw a grenade in BD before making her escape, substantially injuring the crew members and leaving me in need of 2 surgeries, healing and treatment. That was not a good day, but my hero Stephen stood by my side and helped me through it, even with his own injuries and illnesses.</p><p>Within a couple days most of the crew was in the proved human channel. I trusted everyone there apart from Ian, something about him and his movements just didn't sit well, though I couldn't really find evidence that he was mush. I told Roala (Roland now as Paola) that I suspect his double-eating was actually him consuming spores. Ian eventually fell inactive, hours before an apparent oxygen crisis, just as we had received 6 empty pots (Extra Pots projects and a very good trade of inactive Finola). I knew Ian was mush but no one seemed to want to doubt the human group we had established. That served me well later on.</p><p>Ian died of room-caused injuries, revealing that my suspicions were correct, and surprising most of the humans that there is another mush on board. I did not say it then, but at the time I suspected that there were 3 mush in total who had managed to fly under our radar by simulating humanity (really there were 2).</p><p>The humans argued and tried to rationalise, drifting between our non-proven suspects:</p><ul><li><strong>Raluca</strong> who was too active and helpful to be mush, but honourably refused to double eat. I was certain she was human, despite Stephen and Roala doubting her so much. Stephen even bet 3 klix she's mush!</li><li><strong>Frieda</strong> who found us the right planets but didn't do much else, we were also aware that Paola had spored her at least once before her rampage. She hardly ever slept by Janice but never complained about morale. For most of the game she was one of my main suspects once anonymush Ian died.</li><li><strong>Hua</strong> who was hardly ever active, never helped with plants, hardly ever flew out for hunters, at best maybe contributed a couple of times to Projects. She went on an expo and contracted an illness before she went highly inactive. Due to her being pregnant with Roland's baby she was kept on life support for a while (pity the one keeping her on life support was a mush and only ever healed her once, thought she died of depression in the end). It is still very unclear to me what Hua did during this time, but that in itself had me so fixated on her as my other main suspect, that I missed what was staring me directly in the face.</li><li><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> sweet, inexperienced and seemingly dependent on my guidance. I insisted with the others that he's a noob and we shouldn't kill him. On a number of occasions I had some doubts about him, but I also saw him trying hard to be useful and communicate, as opposed to Terry and Gio. Perhaps it was the way he reminded me of a friend of mine, who also often requires guidance. Not wanting to push a newbie into inactivity or disinterest in the game, I held on to the desire to help him and make this ship a good experience for him.</li><li><strong>Terrence</strong> who was lost and confused and genuinely new to the game, but mostly regarded as not active by the humans. Did a number of suspicious things including not taking lenses while piloting and being online but not fixing O2 tank. He also took a while to make the second drone and barely contributed to the Neron Projects. All of this made him a very useful red herring once I got converted.</li></ul><p>After Paola's rampage, Stephen suggested that anyone in BD when the grenade was thrown was most likely human, a claim that favoured KT, an Alpha mush. At Paola's death KT was already accompanied by Ian, their secret informant in the human channel. They soon finished Paola's work and converted Frieda. These mush were no ordinary mush. They were sharp and calculated, noticing every detail and planning strategically. Their coordination, particularly between Frieda and KT, allowed them to devise the greatest of plans.</p><p>KT had me fooled, and he knew it. They must have realised that the human crew was mostly being guided by myself and Captain Stephen (I killed Jin Su pretty early on due to highly suspicious behaviour and his inability to move a ship). Stephen and I were two of the most active players, we strategised and collected data, we kept the other humans from rampaging, and it felt to me like we could have become a marvelous power couple. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to my hero, the mush had other plans for me...</p><p>[To be continued]</p>

                <p>That was an insanely fun ship! I was Captain Stefanos, and boy did I drop the ball on this ship. My biggest regret was not trusting Raluca even though she put her trust in me. Even after she died trying to end the mush threat, I still thought she was a mush who transferred into poor, innocent Kuan Ti. It's such a crime! Kuan Ti's reaction to her attack was so quick and spot on that I just assumed she transferred into him and was trying to kill her old body to keep us from repairing Pilgred. I had it in my head that we lost days ago because we wouldn't be able to repair Pilgred without her help, and even if she had helped us, she could just jack my body and return to Sol. I didn't realize how close we were to being able to turn things around, if I had only trusted her! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Ian I had a feeling you'd be back, but I didn't suspect you one bit. I was invited somewhat later in the chat so I just assumed Raola/Chun/Eleesha had you confirmed. I was thinking the mush was inactive until the ship killed you and revealed an anonymush presence. You didn't see this part of the whisper since you died, but my exact response to your death was, "...What? How? Why?" I thought you were the other alpha mush. It's too bad about Jin Su, I know that he was waiting on the bases to be decoded, but there were windows of opportunity where we could have moved in between bases. I think he just needs to be more in touch with Paola next time.</p><p>I have other questions and comments, but I'll wait for Eleesha to finish posting her story here. I at least want to say WELL DONE to everyone on the mush team, I was so thoroughly screwed with on this one, and I enjoyed every bit of it!</p>

                <p>Hi! "Raoland" here. It sucks to be the first mush who died but I'm glad the rest of the mush team delivered from my sacrifice. Jin Su was suspicious and he was hanging around at the bridge most of the time, I assumed that he's part of the human's chat. I did the rampage at BD because of that and I thought I was gonna get killed next cycle so I acted rashly. My mistake was that I went to the bridge after the fiasco at BD. I should've gone to AD since Ian was there and It'll consume a lot of AP just to kill me or because of my hard-boiled trait. Anyway, Stephen is a brute. He single-handedly injured me while Ms. Kent finished the job.</p><p>As for the scooter, it was with me the whole time. I used to hang around in medlab and drop the scooter there pre-mush selection. Chun didn't even notice that it was thereafter mush selection so I took it. I hope that solves the mystery of the missing scooter. When I transferred to Roland, the body of Paola kept it.</p>

                <p>Hey there, Raoland! You were -so close- to getting me, I only had 1 HP left and an injury that would have caused me to bleed for 1 HP damage on cycle change. When I logged in, I panicked and ran straight to IB to self-heal. If we had used your body to make the Pheromodem, that would have been really bad for the mush team. Fortunately for the mush team, not only did that not happen, but your death had us scratching our heads and luring us(me anyway) into a false sense of security with the assumption that inactive Gioele/Finola was the other alpha, buying the mush team a lot more time. Taking away our Roland's body was crippling as well, as we weren't very well defended from hunters and fires afterwards.</p>
