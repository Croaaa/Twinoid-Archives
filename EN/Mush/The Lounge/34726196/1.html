                <p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1848" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1848</a></p><p>Were you on this ship? Were you confused as to what was going on? Why did Ian take down the camera? Why did Chao attack him even though he turned out to be human? Just who were the Mush? How many were there really? I know some of you had questions like this, especially you my dearest Finola, so I hope this account from one of the chief architects of your demise will help you put all the confusion to rest.</p><p>The voyage began in a routine way, an upbeat crew ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead and then the mush awakened within me and one other. Our first goal was to attempt to return to the rest of our colony on Sol and opportunistically infect anyone else that left themselves vulnerable. Fortunately for us this ship was full of humans that really did not understand how to protect themselves against the Mush threat, with only a couple of notable exceptions such as the troublesome Chun who knew only too well what she was up against but was unable to sufficiently rally the others to take her caution seriously enough.</p><p>Whilst my accomplice, Ian, set about using his authority as one of the chief researchers on the ship to do everything possible to slow down anti-spore research, I set about spreading the infection. The prankster Roland, who had already drawn a lot of suspicion on himself for playing silly tricks like hiding the freezer was the first to turn as he dutifully rummaged in shelves at my behest and treated his ridiculous cold with some 'extra-strong' medication if you catch my drift. By this time everyone just believed he was a jester and this actually provided good cover for him to help infect our second target, Raluca who was content to sit in the engine room all the time asking for Pilgred resets and waiting to be spiked. Although Roland was quick to go anonymush, Raluca was unable to take the skill at all so now the crew were starting to get alarmed, three mush on the radar.</p><p>We all agreed that Chao or Kuan Ti should be our next target and that we would triple spike them once the expedition that was being planned for our dwindling oxygen supplies was underway, however the best laid plans have a habit of going wrong....</p><p>First, Roland's pranking around finally got him in real trouble when he exclaimed to everyone out loud that there was something wrong with the food he just ate because it gave him no AP! &lt;facepalm&gt; Bear in mind Roland was already under a lot of suspicion. I told him to steal the paciphae and stay off the ship and even helped clear the way for him to do it and have a plausible reason for doing so besides being a Mush (fearing for his life) by having his execution publicly ordered. Roland wanted to do a bit more than that though and used his remaining points to sabotage an oxygen tank instead and then was shot by Chao. Now bearing in mind Roland was the anonymush everyone now realized they had FOUR mush on the ship and it would be fair to say tensions were a bit high at this point. Our oxygen was continuing to dwindle to dangerously low levels and nobody could seem to get the expedition organized as the captain had inconveniently gone to sleep and most people were too scared to sit unprotected in the Icarus bay.</p><p>My mushroom friends and I then planned the final act, the coup-de-grace to end it all. My accomplice Ian went to one of the dorms and removed the camera in front of Janice who was the only other person in the room. He then went to the Icarus Bay and transferred into Hua who was basically inactive waiting for the expedition and with a nice full bar of AP proceeded to strip the oxygen tank of what little remaining oxygen we had, picked up the knife and murdered Chun with it right in her lab then took off on a patrol ship.</p><p>The chain of events that followed was more entertaining than any of us foresaw. Chao woke up first and immediately went to where Chun died and ordered a kill on sight on Hua and then searched the ship for her. In doing so he found the log of Ian removing the camera which he assumed must have been to infect Janice and so now Ian and Janice were also prime suspects and a shoot to kill order was put on Ian too. Chao finally found Ian (who at this point was actually the innocent but non-active Hua) and wasted all his AP trying to kill him before giving up and retiring to a dorm. Kuan-Ti woke up and realized that oxygen was a bigger priority than killing Mush and used all his AP to hack Neron BIOS and remove the lock on pilots even though Janice had said she had already done it. He managed to get to the Icarus bay but didn't have enough AP to start the expedition. Janice then woke up, and panicking ran to the Icarus bay and launched the expedition with three people including herself, one on very low health. My plan all along had been to ensure this expedition could never be a success. I calmly awoke from my slumber, sauntered into the engine room to load a fuel and then strolled to the bridge on the ship, taking the final oxygen capsule for myself and a grenade for good measure and then prepared to move the ship out of orbit and leave the hapless humans abandoned on the planet. I'm glad I paused because as it turns out the expedition failed all on its own accord because it was put together under such desperation and so I instructed my accomplice Raluca that it was time to go overt and I promptly threw a grenade into the bridge where Paola and Terrence was and tried to kill Paola. Unfortunately I was not strong enough to kill that little girl all by myself &lt;sigh&gt; so I had to talk Finola who up to this point had been repeatedly saying 'Are we going to die? We can fix this right? Someone tell me it's going to be okay!' into finishing the job for me. I assumed my cover would be blown at this point, but I managed to abuse her naivety further and get her to waste all her remaining actions searching the ship for the identity of the 'real' mush!</p><p>Then a most wonderful thing happened, almost everyone left died from a chain-depression reaction started by the asphyxiation of Terrence. Gioele and Frieda were the only humans left and both had slept most of the journey. Just in case I kept my cover intact and reinforced it with a few pitiful messages and then took a well earned nap to recover some energy. Just as well I bothered, as Gioele woke up, decided that I was the only person left he could trust and killed Raluca and was probably going to try and kill Frieda next except she woke up and against all my best laid plans managed to take the paciphae out and get the oxygen off the planet (I had no idea you could even do that!).</p><p>Enraged, I awoke and immediately moved the ship out of orbit killing her, and my loyal accomplice IanHua leaving only Gioele and myself for a final showdown. Sadly although I waited a while he did not awake and I did not want to give the human the satisfaction of killing me in my sleep so I took a patrol craft off the ship and we both finally perished as the hunters destroyed what was left of our swiss-cheese hull.</p><p>I know this was a long post, but I really felt like I owed an explanation to some of you. If you made it this far, congratulations, this was an epic post for an epic voyage.</p><p>Commander Jin Su, General of fifth fleet and Supreme Ruler of all Humanity.</p>

                <p>Props to Frieda actually. Imagine waking up on a ship where there are four crew left, two of them mush, and everyone else is dead and nobody knows who the mush is, one of the remaining crew has stated he is going to try and kill you and the Icarus is gone and there is 0 oxygen in the tank and the hull is on 15 with 8 hunters outside. I think most people would have reasonably said 'blow this' and gone back to sleep, but she actually went into full 'save the ship' action mode. All without saying a word.</p>

                <p>I was the Ian... let me explain this all to you. I decided to bait you all to Ian by taking all the oxygen tanks, then took the camera down to make you think I spiked Janice in the dorm. After this, I swapped to Hua, as which I took the rest of oxygen capsules, dropped blaster in the corridor and stabbed the freaking Chun to death! She was the one who caused you to fail after all - s he ignored alll the problems, she cared only about taking us down. Let me continue my story - I ran straight to the Phasiphae and have taken off with all your oxygen and knife. Shortly after this, our <em>brilliant</em> Jin-Su convinced the rest of crew to murder eachother.</p><br><p>EDIT- I wrote this post afte reading only the name of post, not what was inside, seems like my fellow mush explained it better.</p>
