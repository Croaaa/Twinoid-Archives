                <p>One day on IRC I said something about killing mush on other ships by having people yell, "For Delzoup!" When they murdered a mush (and then giving that person +1 internets). It evolved to a fun game with some of my friends who took this suggestion to heart and screencap their kills and send them to me, and I tell them how cool they are. It's like a win-win for everyone but the mush.</p><p>I told you that story to tell you this story.</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4001" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4001</a></p><p>So, I had jumped on a ship with my friend. I chose Hua, he chose Ian. I became mush with the lovely Paola. My goal was to aim for Ian - being that he was the sole mush researcher, turning him would be extremely beneficial to us. Paola agreed but changed her mind, because her only mush skill was phalogate, and Ian was playing it smart. She decided to spike the low-hanging fruit Jin Su, who was hanging out in the garden. "He's going to be innactive," I told her. "He's just new," she replied. Turns out we were both wrong. Jin Su continued to do random things until he was killed many turns later - but I'm getting ahead of myself.</p><p>So Paola spikes him x2, and I spike him x1 and take anonymush. Shortly after, Ian figures out Paola's game. She's low in AP, she took a shower and was able to be healed, and a few other likely pieces of evedence. I tell Paola that they have figured it out and they're coming for her--Paola says "I'll just decode this rebel base to prove I"m human <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">." In the end, Frieda kills Paola without any resistance.<br><br>And then it happens - My friend Ian claims the kill in my name. "FOR DELZOUP!"<br><br>It was at this point I decided an AP became mandatory to explain why my buddy was killed in my name <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Sorry Paola!<br><br>So now I was left with the random Jin Su, but not all hope was lost. I had managed to trap Ian once when building the sofa, and again when handing off the medkit so he could heal Chun, who had gone afk for the long weekend (Thank you Chun!). Jin Su walked around being his random self, using the microwave, eating food, and pulling out a spore and spiking Terrence, momentarily ruining my plans to turn Ian. However, since Jin Su had spored in the room with Terrence his mushness was quickly discovered and he was eliminated.<br><br>At this point the humans declared victory, since Ian was certain that Paola ran out of AP trying to spike him directly. Ian asked our (new) Eleesha to print the list, but there was no follow up on that. While we were getting ready for the expo, I managed to trap and turn Ian.<br><br>Now there were two hidden mush. We were planning on taking over the ship slowly, but then Eleesha revealed that she had printed the list to Ian - so we fed her a spiked banana and there were 3 hidden mush among us. She had apparently told Chun - the list was the one with my name, NOT Paola or Jin Su on it, so very bad - but no further mention was made. Things were going swimmingly, until I woke up dead.<br><br>Derek had killed me, and then being at 0 moral, died himself. <br><br>At this point the journey was over for me, but I understand that Ian took his revenge...</p>

                <p>Ian here. I felt so dumb that I fell for the trapped shelves. The best thing I can use to describe is the "Ooh a piece of candy" joke from Family Guy. After I was turned, we made it our goal to keep the ship running and turn as many as we could. We MUSH (including Eleesha) ended up doing most of the work on the ship with the exception of Roland, Terrence, and Frieda who did a ton too.</p><p>After the random murdering of Hua here by Derek I was extremely furious. I didn't want to pin the blame on the leftovers but their reaction to the whole situation was lacking. Hell, they didn't even bother to find out if there were more MUSH on the ship as Chun kept on raving about Pilgred. I decided, with Eleesha, that we would get our revenge. If we cannot have Derek's blood we will have everyone's. Pilgred was a big possibility, we could've just helped out and made it to Sol for a victory but why should we let them? With that, I mutated and killed the only two who had the capabilities of fixing Pilgred: Raluca and Terrence. Eleesha mutated and ran to kill Janice and hurt Frieda. I ended up finishing off Frieda then pounded on Roland until a meteor hit the next cycle. Lesson here children: if it's Cycle 7 and everyone seems helpful, do you really want to agitate the MUSH? Derek single-handedly destroyed this ship when he couldn't keep his gun holstered (hehe sex joke). It was a lot of fun and would've ended with a nice surprise if Derek hadn't killed Hua. We would've jumped to Sol in comfort and the humans would notice there were 3 MUSH hiding under them (maybe 4, I was planning to infect Janice with MUSH babies). But alas, at least we tried.</p>
