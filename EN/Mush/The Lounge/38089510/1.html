First time Lethargy user, HOLY MOLY IT'S EFFECTIVE. Banking double AP and extinguishing/healing/gardening in one cycle, she really does wonders, even I sometimes broke the cycle. New personal favourite character!</p><p>If you checked the end screen, you probably noticed that the two mushes were got early. Ian was hunted down quickly (from dirtyness, not camera, although I barely remember), while Frieda just suicided. It was a bad attempt and from the message I can see that she had enough fo the ship, but at least she tried to take 2 demoralised players with her.</p><p>Troughout the mush menace I hold monopoly on the weapons, which was suprisingly easy considering that 3 people had Shooter as skill, yet no one asked about them until an expedition. Since I had more AP to burn, I hid both blasters in random, but (for me) frequent bays while held knife/armor on me.</p><p><em>It was a normal day, but for Chun, things were about to change for the worst....</em></p><p>Logged in sometime mid cycle, only to see a new icon. Suicidal. Huh. Did I forgo-- OH. In a dorm Frieda came up to me and demoralised 6 times, also used some on Raluca, then went to stand around in one of the turrets. Since it was a mush action in plain sight and me and Raluca both noticed, I though she will cause further harm is left alive as she must know that is is her last action.<br>I just had a buttload of AP banked and all the weapons with me, I stated what happened to the anti mush group and went after her. (I was on 0 morale, but there was still an hour or so left)<br><br>Bam! Bam! Bam! Frieda still alive as I clicked for the sixth time on the blaster fire. <strong>*Crack!</strong>* Two injuries.<br>Now I like to imagine that something spectacular happened, but it is probably that my gun missed, the knockback pushed Chun to the floor, breaking her legs and impaling her on something to bleed.<br><br>With no way to communicate (no talkie), having AP but unable to leave the room, bleeding 2hp per cycle, it was pretty grim. After picking up and dropping the gun to show activity in the room, Stephen came in to comfort me, but somehow missed that <em>I WAS LYING ON A POOL OF MY BLOOD.</em><br><br>.......I might have cheated a little as I posted this on the fail thread, and also to the mushpedia to add to the Broken Legs part, since somebody saw this and came to my help. Now I would state the incredible BSness that Broken Legs literally kills a player if Finola doesn't have Medic to heal it, but that wouldn't change the fact that I cheated. At least she had and came to my help, which was suprising since I though she was dead (barely saw her activity).<br><br>Thank you Stephen for morale, Finola to heal and others to help, it was probably the first time I saw the crew put some effort into saving someone, in this case, me. <strong>HUGS FOR EVERYONE!</strong><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"><br><br><br>Anyway, after that the ship went down the typical "after-mush" road. Each day less and less activity and communication, people died without any reaction (poor Hua), expeditions were barebones, and slowly the RNG grinded us down. I took after healing and gardening, even with Lethargy sometimes needing help with it. AP name comes from this, we had huge amounts of fruits but no eaters. One even started rotting in one of the dorms after nobody wanted it, same goes to the garden (fire happened there before we returned, I had no heart to see the damage).<br>Not much happened during this, and we returned to Sol after everything broke in 3 cycles.<br><br>So gg wp for the remaining crew, it was a fun trip. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Although it was nice seeing Lethargy, Apprentice <strong>and</strong> Creative for the first time, all on the same ship...</p>
