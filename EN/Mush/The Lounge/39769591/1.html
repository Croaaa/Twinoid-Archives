                <p>Hey you guys, we made it ! No shrink, no leader, no last hope, no cat, four brutal deaths in two short cycles (with no connection and after most of the crew had spent the first day change without Chun), two suicides, and yet... we survived ! We could even have lasted a little longer since we got a lot of oxygen and the day 5 rebel base.</p><p>There were some close calls, our morale was freakishly low for most of the trip, and we did lose Frieda and Kuan Ti to fatal depression. Sorry you couldn't make it, both of you... But the 8 remaining crew members can be proud of themselves for surviving for so long and going back to Sol with the serum.</p><p>I was Eleesha, by the way. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4751" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4751</a></p>

While we were waiting for everyone to get in, it was looking promising, some apparently active people, plasma shield was the first option in nexus... Other things were not so nice, most of the crew woke up on d1 but Chun only did on d2c1 (and seemed to be a tutorial newbie that never started it) which means some of us had lower morale when the ship was full. But that wouldn't be a problem, right? We had Janice in a dorm, Jin Su, the cat, the connection would be established... morale would be easy to get... Wrong.</p><p>5 minutes after mush selection, I saw Derek picking up a blaster in alpha dorm where I was sleeping. I barely had time to think "That's odd" and he had already killed Janice in bravo dorm. Jin Su's death message followed shortly. I went to bravo dorm, saw that he removed all the 4 spores of the day and had also tried (and failed to kill Andie). He was killed fairly quickly after, leaving many people with 2 or 3 morale left. I went to the bridge to try to establish the connection and decided to cuddle the cat on my way up. I did it in good time because Stephen decided to follow his mush partner. But if Derek's rampage was already quite lame, Stephen's was as lame as worthless. He demoralized Chun and Raluca which was great because we didn't lose morale with their deaths. If he had killed them, most of the crew would suicide right after. He also killed the cat after demoralizing Raluca to death and decided to sabotage nexus door and trap himself inside. Which stopped us from killing him for about 2minutes, the time for Eleesha to step in rear corridor and fix the door.</p><p>After the lame an uncreative attempts to end with humanity, we were damaged and demoralized but we weren't done. Doing it and a few bananas helped most of us from killing ourselves (Sadly, Frieda and Kuan Ti didn't make it). After the initial rampage we still had 2 techs (Eleesha and Kuan Ti) so we started Pilgred asap. Kuan Ti died halfway through it but Eleesha was able to finish it.</p><p>We focus next on the serum, we got a medic and biologist magebooks, Ian read the first one and Roland foolishly read the second after everyone had agreed Eleesha would be the best person for it. But neverthless, we were able to finish the serum on d5.</p><p>By that time we also had full o2 tanks and some morale thanks to d5 rebel base. We could even have lasted a couple more days but we had shown the mush that early and unplanned rampages are definitely not always the end of humans.</p>

                <p>I have nothing against rampage, really. Except brainless rampage on D1, where a mush mutates, punches someone in the hope of killing them, and then waits for the crew to get rid of them. Most of the time it's just plain suicide.</p><p>But rampage because you have no choice or <em>good</em> D1 rampage is fine. Yours was a good try and you nearly succeeded. You could have literally wrecked us with a little more luck and a little more planning. Too bad (for you, not for us <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) that you were so incredibly unlucky with the RNG... As Chao with Shooter, Wrestler, Phagocyte and Fertile, I once managed to find the hidden hacker kit, load fuel, hack the command terminal, move the ship to abandon an expedition, and then kill 4 people. Would have killed at least one more if Ian hadn't got in the way.</p><p>On our ship, the grenade was in bravo bay and the grenade BP was right there in bravo dorm, it's a shame they weren't used. Stephen could also have become a pilot, since he had Apprentice, and taken off with the adult banana trees. Transfer would also have been a fun possibility. And of course killing Chun and Raluca instead of demoralizing them (even if it meant waiting a few cycles more to have more AP and more spores) would have caused more than half the crew to suicide and would have doomed the ship.</p><p>Anyway... at least rampages like that make ships more memorable than most other ships, even for humans, especially if they manage to survive.</p>

                <p>Only looking at the results it seems like it is more Stephen's fault that mush didn't win since killing the cat would have also been Raluca's death and with the remaining aps he could have been able to get rid of all technicians by killing or morale loss. But I think Stephen was overextended with the surprising situation (especially that he wasn't informed about it) and acted therefore not fully reasonable anymore.</p>

                <p>Oh yeah, Stephen was far from playing well. He could have finished the ship if he had made better choices.</p><p>He didn't wait for his "rampage", he started few minutes after Derek was killed, and very close to the cycle change. He demoralized Chun killing her, then he demoralized Raluca and only after Raluca was dead he killed the cat. If he had killed them instead of demoralizing them to dead, half the crew would have suicide the next cycle change. And killing the cat after Raluca was dead, was silly. He also took the time to cook us 7 rations, which was very nice of him since we were happy to eat them. And he sabotaged nexus door, I guess to delay us from killing him. When we had a pilot magebook. And he had apprentice.</p>

                <p>Demoralizing Raluca was really a waste. Schrödinger's death would have been enough to make her lose 4 morale and die at cycle change. The AP used on Raluca would have been better used on killing Chun instead of demoralizing her, which would have made us lose more morale.</p><p>He could also have almost showered to death, then taken Mycelium spirit, transferred, killed his old body (more morale lost for us) and be killed or escape in a patrol ship.</p>
