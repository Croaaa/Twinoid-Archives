Too many inactives and lack of research power meant post Day 10 was just too much for our small crew and we had to go back to Sol. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong><em>The Alpha Mush</em></strong><br><strong>Stephen, Raluca</strong> - Both Mutated</p><p><strong><em>Actives: </em></strong><br><strong>Frieda, Eleesha, Jin Su, Roland, Hua, Ian, Kuan Ti, Paola</strong> (well till the end)</p><p><strong><em>Did some work: </em></strong><br><strong>Janice</strong> (active early but then inactived later)</p><p><strong><em>Tha Bad</em></strong> (inactives, griefers, idiots):<br><strong>Derek, Andie, Gioele, Terrence, Chun</strong> (she was also a newb/griefer/idiot)</p><p>I was <strong>Frieda</strong>, played pretty actively as usual. What surprised me was the rare active <strong>Jin Su</strong> and <strong>Eleesha</strong>. Both of them were really active players that helped make the ship really well.</p><p>As it so happens I guess our Mush wanted a quick game so <strong>Stephen </strong>Mutated in the lab and dropped a <em>Grenade </em>on everyone there (not in that order) but forgot <strong>Ian </strong>was in the lab and blew all his AP. <strong>Jin Su</strong> and <strong>Eleesha </strong>showed up and decided they couldn't wait for <strong>Ian </strong>to move so they just knifed him down with some good crits.</p><p>Then as we are settling <strong>Raluca </strong>Mush also Mutates and attacks people but also doesn't kill anyone. She dies in short order as well. They spiked the cat but otherwise we felt in the clear. <strong>Eleesha </strong>tried to print the List and got nothing so we were Mush free!</p><p>This was pretty exciting as we had some good actives and I had some serious hope. Unfortunately humanity started getting in the way immediately. First off our <strong>Chun </strong>was a first time player, didn't speak the language, didn't care, or some combination of the above. She didn't say anything, wandered around, but somehow had played enough to NOT pick<em> Humanity's Hope</em> but <em>Nurse</em>! She didn't stay in the lab and punched random people too. Eventually she had to be put down. So we were losing 2 morale a day. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Andie </strong>died in a similar fashion. She picked up the <em>Apron </em>and sat on it for several cycles until<strong> Jin Su</strong> got fed up and knifed her down. I was concerned about this but ultimately <strong>JS </strong>turned out to be one of our MVPs.</p><p>Most of the other people died of starvation or depression.</p><p>After we got the Mush down we focused most of our efforts on <strong>NERON </strong>and <strong>PILGRED </strong>with good performance, and <strong>Ian </strong>got occasional relays on research. He did have a lot of work to do as we got <strong><em>Heat Lamp</em></strong>s and <strong><em>Extra Hydropots</em></strong> (which ultimately saved us time and again. SO MANY FRUITS!) <strong>Eleesha </strong>picked up the extra <em>Pilot </em>Book, and <strong>Paola </strong>took the <em>Radio Expert</em> book (she had Logistics to start).</p><p>We missed several bases (including the ration one) but that wasn't <strong>Paola's </strong>fault, we had to do some running and forgot about bases here and there.</p><p>We also managed to nail a ton of GREAT <strong>NERON </strong>projects. <strong><em> Plasma Shield, General Patching Up, Armored Corridors, Patrol Blasters, Automatic Sprinklers</em></strong> to say a few (including the previously mentioned Gardening ones). We had one close call with O2 in the beginning when we got down to 7 but after that we were totally solid (found O2 planets, tons of O2 from plants)</p><p>We got really lucky finding a Map Fragment early with <strong>Cristalite</strong>, and later we found one as an artifact drop in either a <strong>Cavern </strong>or <strong>Intelligent Life</strong>.</p><p>But you know how things go. Pressure was steadily mounting. We had some communication issues with <strong>Hua </strong>which caused a bit of AP loss or cycle miscoordination. We had to spend a lot of AP on speeches till the plants got up and running, and we had to spend tons of AP on <strong><em>PILGRED</em></strong>. Our research was always way behind (never got <strong><em>Healing Pomade</em></strong> or <strong><em>Meridon</em></strong>, OR the serum <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> ) and people were slowly getting killed by the ship.</p><p>Despite getting quite a few steaks and fruits (never a Jumpkin though in about 12 Fruit drops) people were still getting pretty low.</p><p>Then Day 10 hit (well D10C4) and the Hunter swarms and fires started going up. We fought it off for a while while trying to find another artifact planet and we finally did but the ship was in terrible shape. Many things were broken, many people were at sub 9 health. We finally decided to chance this last planet and if we got a Fragment we might try to push the <strong><em>Calculator </em></strong>through in a last gasp effort. The planet had 2<em> Intelligent Life </em>and we had the<em> Babel Module</em> (but no <em>Diplomat</em>). Unfortunately all we got was an <em>Alien TV</em>.</p><p>So here we are back in Sol with quite a few dead and no serum, but at least we are alive.</p><p>Many thanks to <strong>Eleesha </strong>and <strong>Jin Su</strong> for being super active and quite the team! <strong>Roland, Paola, Ian, Hua and KT</strong> also get big thanks for being pretty active as well. I think we would've made it if <strong>Janice </strong>hadn't quit halfway through the game, or if we even had one more active. OR a <em>Biologist </em>book! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I'll see you guys in the next game!</p>

It was quite a ride!</p><p>Jin Su and I are friends, and we did jump together. (It was a close thing! I was the last to join!) Luckily, he didn't mind being the really-rare Jin Su and I happen to really enjoy playing Eleesha (She is high on quite a few title lists, she gets a ton of nice skills, and she is integral to the mush hunt as a human after all), so it turned out okay!</p><p>Considering the consistent issues that plagued us (Inactivity, morale, and our lovable huggable potato!), I would say we did damn fine at making it as far as we did. Sadly, I've really found Intelligent Life to be a huge gamble when it comes to starmap pieces. Crystallite is really the only way to get them with any reasonable chance.</p><p>I will say, it was a true pleasure working with such an experienced and friendly Frieda. You showed me a lot of the hidden power the old bat has hidden under the hood. (Seriously, you were practically our main researcher with your IT points!)
