                <p>a.k.a. "And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling RNG."</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2587">Here there be Honors</a></p><p>So there I was, blissfully solitary Raluca, toiling away in the engine room while the ship goes on around me. I never even had to ask for help with resetting the Pilgred: Gioele was always ready to come down and help out with it. As per Chao's direction, I was relaxing in the turret, so never actually had to attempt to be social. He popped down twice this way, and while Chao had warned against people doing repeat trips, I was never there, so surely I was safe.</p><p>Shortly after, Plasma Shield popped up on NERON, and considering I was clearly the ship Genius, I ran up to give it an instant completion. That's when life as I knew it changed entirely.</p><p>Suddenly the only two important voices in the universe were Frieda and Gioele, while the other thirteen people on the ship seemed like so much distant space chatter now. I had been working my way towards Designer designation, but now I had new priorities. Becoming a stronger mush, I immediately learned anonymush to hide among the crew and chose some other skills that could possibly hold future potential in the right opportunity.</p><p>It wasn't long after this that Chao cornered and tortured poor Gioele, before slaughtering him. Chao contacted me to get checked on the mycoscan, so I did a wander up and reported back only one spore. Gioele must have just been using the Pilgred as an excuse for being dirty, and not actually trying to convert me.</p><p>By this time, we were running low on oxygen, and Frieda had found one small planet found with oxygen. Janice and Chao hopped in the shuttle, and dear Frieda jumped into action. She stole the astrophysicist book and hid it, raced down to put one fuel in the engine room, ran back up towards the bridge, sabotaging both oxygen tanks on the way, stole the hacker kit from the lab, and we took off. I'm sure Janice and Chao are happy together on the planet we left them on. Obviously, Frieda was not long for this life after that.</p><p>At this point, a clear depression seemed to take over. Most everyone else stopped talking or even responding to my pleas to help with the Pilgred so we could try and make a last-ditch return to Sol before lack of oxygen killed everyone. Ian was kind enough to come down and do a reset for me, but he was to be the last one. As the RNG and morale losses seemed to take out the most active players first, while either less active or just quiet-and-waiting crew members stayed alive, Kuan Ti did come down to the Engine Room, but he only accessed the Pilgred without actually resetting it. Realizing I had to attempt it alone and hope for the best, I pushed as much into Pilgred as I could. And here the RNG attacked me to give me the lowest possible work results - I hit 98% when I could no longer put any more to it alone.</p><p>As the rest of the crew died around me, I made my way to the lab to pick up Schrodinger. We went by the Refectory where I grabbed the Mad Kube. While I let Schrodinger down to play on the floor of the Bridge, I sat in the captain's chair and played with the Kube until NERON ejected me from the ship. I like to think that somewhere out there, Schrodinger is still on the bridge, puzzling over the strange cube and exploring the powerful ship he has been left alone to run.</p>

                <p>Hi, Chao here.</p><p>was a great game for me! In the beginning I helped with antimush research and with the help of Jin, Finola and Chun we were really quick with antispore gas, mycoalarms and myoscan. I said in the beginning that not every time the same person should reset pilgred. Gioele did it, I was probably not strict enough to torture him because of that earlier.</p><p>Was funny when it was revealed that Gioele was mush, he mentioned that he was dirty after pilgred and that he had a health loss because of room shaking and that he wanted a healing in the medlab. When I actually wanted to grab your drone, Raluca, I saw him standing dirty in the medlab and thought.. hm.. let's just check. ...<br>I was really surprised when I saw the log: boobytrap, extract, access, boobytrap, boobytrap...<br>and that he had only 4 ap left. (probably he was a bronze mush and took always shower damage...)<br>Unfortunately I had also only 3 ap and because of silver I wasn't sure to pick up wrestler as second skill.. so i tried it to kikll him with norma punches. it failed.. I went quickly to the kitchen to eat something, tok also the blaster on my way to take shooter if necessary.. and when I returned that Gioele was away already.. I had to run a long distance until I found him in a dorm, spiking in front of a camera, he escaped again, I followed, with no ap left, I took shooter and that was it for Gioele. What a relief for me... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Since we had antispore days already for some time I thought that the other mush had to be a person who is either inactive... or a person who can't be dirty that often-because Gioele did all the spiking.<br>I shouldn't had decided that it is probably an inactive person. I think I trusted the security too much. So it was easy for Frieda to abandon me and Janice on that expedition, really well played, Frieda!</p><p>But at that moment I thought actually: Frieda, that wasn't smart. They just have to kill you and finish pilgred quickly which shouldn't be a problem with a Raluca who has technician and physicist.</p><p>I was really surprised and disappointed that after my death all the humans lost hope and didn't try to fight hard. I wanted to shout on you, but it was impossible for me now. I think they just would have to kill Frieda and reset the pilgred some times for Raluca and that's it. Humanity has won! <br>Why Jin, why? You as commander have the responsibilty to hold the hopes high and give an order to survive. You can't simply say: "well played, mush. That's it. GG."</p><p>The biggest surprise was after the game ended which revealed you as mush, Raluca. Now I knew, we had no chance against you mushes ^^.</p><p>I really didn't expect that you were already a mush, Raluca! especially since you had a mycoalarm really quick so it shouldn't be possible to spike you or boobytrap the engine room anymore. How and when were you converted?</p><p><strong>The only ship I was playing against as smart mushes as you were was on a MMM ship. Congratulations!</strong></p>

How and when were you converted?</cite><br><p>Hi, I wasn't on your ship but I sure enjoy reading AP threads.</p><p>Common misunderstanding, but mycoalarms don't detect booby-trapping, only direct spiking. If Raluca had stayed in the engine room once that mycoalarm was placed, she would have been much safer - you have to be alone to secretly booby trap (and no camera) but mycoalarms don't matter - but the mycoalarm would have prevented secret spiking.</p>

                <p>Considering that it's been less than 24 hours and everyone has long since confirmed their deaths, it seems like we didn't have any inactives. So the only conclusion is that everyone else truly did just stop playing. At one point I even announced we were at 98% and I would be offline for a few cycles. If they had suspected me, they could easily have finished the Pilgred, killed me, and gone home for a human win. After so many cycles of silence, I would have been fine with that because it at least meant there were still people playing.</p>
