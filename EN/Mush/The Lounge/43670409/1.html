                <p>Paola alpha mush <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> in this ship <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6383" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6383</a></p><p>That was a loooooooong journey. We came back home on D17C2 with one starmap piece.</p><p>This ship started on 23th or 24th of December if I remember correctly. I was trying to choose a character that didn't need too much time to play because it was Christmas and when I saw Paola I didn't hesitate to pick her.</p><p>Everything went fine, the crew was active, many gold players, and it looked like a fun ship, until I was chosen mush. What to say... I hate to play Paola as a mush because, usually, you don't have many options and it's too easy to get caught. Anyway, I decided to try my best.</p><p>My partner was gold Hua, level 14 mush, really active and cooperative. We were talking about what to do. She had a lot of options, opportunities to get dirty and to get easy infections but not me. We decided to take it easy and wait for a while.</p><p>D2 was getting over and I had no sofa or connection to Sol in the bridge, so I asked for a bed in one of the dorms. Luckily, Terrence told me to go to Bravo Dorm to get one and I took that opportunity to spore twice. My main concern was my AP usage so I took fertile to hide this action and took a stealth shower.</p><p>On D3, I was back to the bridge with two spores and ready to work on my dear Comms. I told Hua to play low and go for the long run. Not like I would be able to get dirty again, going back to the dorms to shower, or even spike people. She agreed and we waited for stuff to happen.</p><p>All our crew was active and working hard except a newbie Ian who just found his walkie talkie in the bridge and never came back. That was an opportunity. I asked Stephen or Gioele to kick him out using as a excuse that he was leeching my logistics. I was really lucky and he ended up in the Front Corridor. I spiked him once on my way for food.</p><p>In general I was really lucky in the early game because of it and because we couldn't connect to Sol until a day later (it took like... 10 tries? First time I see it). It helped me to explain why Comms were that slow. And it gave Hua an excuse to come to the bridge and spike Ian again. He was ready to be converted, and I did it next day while getting food again, and picked anonymush. Everything was set for an Sol/Eden infection. Also, getting the Kivan√ß rebel base on the second Xyloph helped a lot.</p><p>Talking about non-mush stuff, research was going fast and well. Chun learned medic from a magebook and used Kuan Ti and Andie to rush all the anti-mush research in a good time. On the other hand, Neron's projects were a bit slower. Christmas didn't help as we couldn't be as active as we wanted to. Plants were planted, we had many active pilots killing hunters and scrapping and Eleesha was mush hunting. An ideal ship.</p><p>Or maybe not that ideal. Raluca and Derek started to talk about mush testing. The first one proposed to test ourself with some kind of sex test (doing the thing and checking ourselves in the mycoscan after that.) and the second one was food testing himself quite regularly, just to be trusted (<img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico">). We had quite an argument about that. I told Raluca that her test doesn't work and that I don't support food tests (and I'm still saying it) and she accused me of being mush. Lesson learned, you should talk about this topic before mush selection and not after. Hua got really pissed off about that and decided to rampage just to show them that food testing makes the mush hunting, and the game in general, boring. But she waited a bit to get enough AP and a good opportunity for it.</p><p>Hua asked me to help her to convince the rest of the crew to get Armored Corridors instead of Blaster Gun. The main reason for it was that she was concern about her AP usage aswell. In the late game she won't be able to explain why she isn't killing that many hunters if she has food, rebel bases decoded and Blaster Gun. We failed on that. Later, it happened again with Magnetic Net and Automatic Sprinklers. The first one would prevent us to run away in the Pasiphae if we needed to, so we tried to convince them again and this time we succeed. 1-1.</p><p>As an anonymush Paola mush I had two big concerns: my lack of AP as I said before, and Eleesha's list. Seeing that Hua wanted to rampage I asked her to kill Eleesha to avoid her list. She agreed and told me she was going to help me to stay hidden. If you read this, Hua, thank you very much. You were the perfect mush partner.</p><p>To be short: Hua started a rampage that night, killed Terrence to get the wrench, dismantled the second shower and a camera (I think) and transfered to Eleesha. She got killed pretty fast but it worked. One problem less. Or maybe not, because I read a message in the mush channel after her transfer: "Eleesha: I forgot to close my PM with you. I'm so sorry". After it, I saw that Hua dropped her walkie-talkie and closed it. "I got caught and they know everything I'm doing" was the first thing I though and I started to wonder what to do. I decided to wait for a bit because, well... I didn't have enough AP to kill people or the ability to transfer.</p><p>So I waited again, and waited.</p><p>Just after that, Raluca was tested with the Natamy rifle and died the next day from injuries. She was human and it was a bit ironic that the one who supported mush testing was killed like that.</p><p>It was D5 or D6 and our inactive Ian should had started to starve. Eleesha/Hua checked him with the medikit that he was at full health so it was obvious that he was the second mush. But our Derek, oh my dear Derek, who was food testing regularly and stated in public that he was holding a blaster and full AP waiting for mush (transfer baiting? Nope, I think. He claimed he took shooter so he was safe from transfer <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> even though we tried to tell him how transfer really works) decided to go on and kill Kuan Ti because our progress in the nexus was slow and he wasn't reporting it. Yes, it was slow because he spent all his AP in research but Derek didn't bother to checked or ask. After his failure, we decided to terminate him for our own safety.</p><p>On day later, we killed Ian. Mush. So it looked obvious that we were free of mush and we decided to aim for Eden. Our Frieda was new and I was trying to help her and teach her how to work as an astrophysicist but she died on day 10 more or less from random damage. A great loss.</p><p>Everything looked fine for Eden infection but I was still paranoid. Hua/Eleesha should had read my mushy PM and I genuinely though they were waiting to cure me. But I hadn't decoded the genome disk yet. I decided to do it anyway and hope she didn't realized she had that PM after transfer.</p><p>What follows it's 10 days of paranoia and fear. Many times I though they were just faking and preteding to be mush free to kill or cure me later. But after I saw the hacker kit dropped in the bridge, natamy rifle in the front corridor and the cure in the lab, I started to become more confident. My AP usage was still a problem that I tried to hide as better as I could. Also, I was counting my morale, but I couldn't fake panic attacks because I didn't want them to waste AP on me if we wanted to reach Eden. And the same thing happened with food. I just ate the minimum not to waste it. No jumpkings for me to avoid illnesess, no expeditions to avoid mush traps and illnesses... the usual stuff.</p><p>On day 14, we finished Plasma shield and Fire detector. Yes, that late. Thanks God that we had good and active pilots. Anyway, we were really lacking manpower and unlucky with the RNG. We had mush traps in cristalite and useless artifacts in the other zones. We decided to last until day 15 or 20 for the achievement. Realizing Eden wasn't an option and I failed to reach my main goal, I changed it and started to convert people. Using the broken sofa as an excuse, got dirty and started spiking Jin Su. It took three days but on day 15, he was one of us and I started to work in converting Hua or Janice. They both had one spore from mush traps and I spiked them few times.</p><p>On day 17, we went to another planet where we found our first starmap piece (sigh) and I took that opportunity to finish Hua. One cycle later, we came back to Sol.</p><p>For characters:<br><strong>Eleesha/Hua</strong> (beta mush): You were mush hunting really well in the early game and I though you got me few times. Really well played.<br><strong>Janice</strong> : I hoped you enjoyed the game. Your reaction in the IRC after that was funny. Good luck with your kittens!<br><strong>Roland</strong> : Did his job very well. You attracted all the steel plates of the ship!<br><strong>Stephen</strong> : The one who finished with our Derek menace. Awesome pilot.<br><strong>Chun</strong>: I used the cure on you, just to be sure you weren't mush! I should have the picture somewhere around here.<br><strong>Gioele</strong>: Our COFFEENATOR! You were a machine created to terminate all the coffee and repair the ship. I hope you don't mind the truth about your daughter.<br><strong>Andie</strong>: Our cat. After I while I think we all learned how to talk cat language.<br><strong>Jin Su</strong>: My dear beta mush. Thanks for all the missions to hide my AP!<br><strong>Hua/Eleesha</strong> (alpha mush): You were the perfect mush partner. In the end, everything worked fine. Well done!</p>

VERY well played ^^.<br><br>ooh, 1 more thing.... STUPID DEREK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! really how STUPID can you be -.-.......<br><br>overall, a great ship ^^. I don't care that the mush won, it was AWESOME.<br><br>btw, in case you haven't noticed... I was Chun :p.</cite></p><p>Yes, there are many mistakes because my memory isn't that great. They also told me that Raluca was tested before Hua started her rampage. Hard to remember everything in a 17 day journey. But I agree that it doesn't matter who won, it was a great ship. With Kuan Ti and/or Frieda we could have made it to Eden.</p><p>I'm think I will ask to ban pheromodem before mush selection in my next ships. It makes the mid-late game much more interesting and increases the paranoia. I really hate that research.</p><p><cite>Also, your Derek was ... well, Derek. What did you expect? </cite></p><p>You are right. He was the perfect example of... Derek <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
