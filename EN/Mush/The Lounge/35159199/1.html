                <p>Eleesha here, round just ended with return to Sol, all <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> killed. Great game.</p><p><strong>Short version:</strong></p><p>Terrence walked in on Mush Stephen removing spores on day 1 or 2... bad luck, really. Stephen was quickly killed.</p><p>Research was done super fast and link to Sol wasn't too much of a problem. We had a dead mush and the genome disk helping with all kinds of anti-mush research.</p><p>I remember pilots complaining about frequent waves of hunters, but they took quick care of them regardless. Day 4 we had plasma shields researched, but when Janice was told to go turn them on she left the dorm few minutes before cycle change, walked around a bit and then idled in the rear corridor. Hull damage was already at 50% and she wasn't showing any sign of noting our messages to turn the shields on, so Paola killed her. I don't blame her. Terrence turned the shield on when he became the Neron admin.</p><p>I got coproralia from witnessing Jin Su and Kuan ti dying of injuries. This and vertigo were now uncurable since our only shrink was dead. Coproralia was hilarious though.</p><p>The List I printed on day 5 was useles, because it mentioned Stephen. It was unlikely that Paola or Chao would be mush since they killed Stephen, but other than that I had no idea: the crew did a lot of suspicious stuff. Raluca walked around with the cat, Ian conveniently forgot the apron on him and Terrence searched around and found one of our hidden mycoalarms. At that point I had no idea who the second mush could be.</p><p>We were starting to run low on oxygen again. Finola, Chao, Hua and Roland had had a very succesful first expedition on a small planet, but that was already a few days ago. Now Frieda had no luck with planets, but Chao scanned one with oxygen so we headed there.</p><p>Enter day 7. Engine and Icarus bay are on fire. There is still one broken oxygen tank from last night and less than a day's worth of oxygen, on an orbit of a planet with oxygen, but unfortunately also seismic activity.</p><p>And there is a mush hidden among the crew.</p><p>Terrence, I think you should've waited longer. It was obvious you had a lot of things to do since you didn't do much last night. But you didn't extinguish the fires, you didn't fix the broken equipment. What did you do? I got curious.</p><p>I had fixed the bravo side oxygen tank that morning. And it was broken again, and I knew only you had been there. Also you had taken the Lizaro Jungle blueprints and headed to the bay where the pilots left their scrap. At this point it was obvious. Paola and Chao made quick work of you and the sabotaged oxygen tanks were quickly repaired.</p><p>The last expedition. This planet was huge, with little oxygen and many ways to get killed. After the expedition crew first landed on the seismicly active area and returned straight back to Daedalus, we all knew you didn't have a choice but to go back. With a mission from Chao, Hua piloted the Icarus back down there, bringing back the alien opener, full tanks of fuel, oxygen to last a few days and everyone still alive. Unbelievable.</p><p>Our last mission was to survive until the Retro-Fungal Serum was researched. Chao was so exhausted after the expedition, he only woke up after two asteroids had already hit us. Good thing you repaired the hull before we killed you, Terrence.</p><p>It was fairly calm when I went to bed, but I didn't think we could finish the serum that fast. <br>Day 9, we have reached Sol.</p>
