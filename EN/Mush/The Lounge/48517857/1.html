                <p><span class="tid_sideNote">This was a coop, RP ship in which all the characters had their own secret motives.</span></p><p>Good evening, mush, humans, bots, and Groots. This is Ian Soulton speaking. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Our <span class="tid_strike">ship</span> <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8180">lunatic asylum</a> landed on Eden yesterday after twenty days of <span class="tid_strike">peaceful trip</span> pure madness through space. I hope that the first building on the planet will be a psychiatric hospital, because almost everyone, down to the shrink herself, was wildly insane.</p><p>Judge for yourself... We had barely woken up from cryo when Paola screamed and fainted because she had pink hair. Stephen started yelling at "Rolando" and accused him of being a murderer while addressing an imaginary camera. Chao sang instead of speaking. As for me, I'm ashamed to say that I engaged in the first of many <span class="tid_strike">dignified conversations</span> ex-lovers' spats with Finola.</p><p>Things didn't improve as the days went by. It turned out that Paola was in fact Derek Hogan, the victim of a transfer by the real Paola who then converted <span class="tid_strike">him</span> her and stuffed her into cryo before going off with the Rebels as Derek.</p><p>Meanwhile, things kept disappearing (an extinguisher, our first starmap fragment...) and it took us many days before finding out that Janice was a kleptomaniac who had a hidden stash of items in Front storage (Gioele discovered about twenty of them, not including those which were destroyed by fires).</p><p>We also found out that Chun was really a <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/1/b/b54a5b97_516.jpg">bot</a>, whose presence aboard and creation remain quite a mystery. We tried to solve that mystery while teaching her how to behave properly (like teaching her not to strip in public, or explaining that people did not need to be upgraded), until the day she... er... did something unspeakable to Terrence. As a revenge, he "fixed" her, and she started beeping and bumping into walls. Then, for some reason, she said something about being a potential bomb, but then she got pregnant from Kuan Ti, which prevented her from exploded. <em>Don't ask me to explain. I have no idea what happened there, and I'm waiting impatiently for her explanations.</em></p><p>Even Gioele, reasonable, strong, level-headed Gioele, had some disturbing <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/7/a/af188481_516.jpg">hallucinations</a>...</p><p>All this madness culminated in the Groot Wars, which nearly turned the daily gardening sessions into a bloodbath. Groot was originally a <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/0/4/98d505cc_516.jpg">banana tree</a> kidnapped by Kuan Ti, who believed that the plant was his best friend and refused to return him, forcing me to take <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/1/9/93758da0_516.jpg">drastic measures</a>. But Kuan Ti refused to surrender Groot.</p><p>Forgetting his resentment against "Rolando", Stephen turned against "Kuan Tilando" the plant murderer, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/1/f/45f9d645_516.jpg">heated discussion</a> soon became a <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/4/1/a6e95237_516.jpg">shouting</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/8/a/fca2ba04_516.jpg">match</a>, eventually ending in an <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/8/6/43c1c450_516.jpg">epic</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/3/d/9e761af8_516.jpg">fight</a> in the garden.</p><p>Somehow, we managed to survive this without any murder, and after that terrible scene, all our plants were named Groot. Or Bat Groot. I do hope that we will have a thriving Groot plantation on the Eden colony.</p><p>Now, having told the story of the ship (at least the story as I know it, but there are gaping holes in it, because dark things happened on that ship), I will tell you my personal story.</p>

                <p>So... you thought I was a quiet, peaceful, harmless gardener?</p><p>Well, you thought wrong. I, <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/3/e/c1e395f2_516.jpg">Ian Soulton</a>, was a Master Assassin from the Crimson Society. I'm sure you had never heard of that secret society <em>(unfortunately for you, now that you have heard of it, we're gonna have to kill you)</em>, but you have probably heard of some of our most glorious <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/b/5/608fdf1c_516.jpg">deeds</a>. Having reached the age of 40, as per tradition, I had vowed never to kill again and my mission aboard was to find an apprentice, and train them to be my successor. I eventually chose <span class="tid_strike">Paola</span> Derek, choosing to trust him despite the fact that he was a mush. After his initial <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/2/2/ddb96f47_516.jpg">doubts</a> <em>(as if I wasn't credible as a professional assassin!)</em>, which forced me to <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/7/3/1eb3535e_516.jpg">prove</a> that I was telling the truth, I started giving him various <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/d/3/801f92a1_516.jpg">exercises</a>, which he carried on <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/a/6/bc119c8d_516.jpg">enthusiastically</a>. Meanwhile, we had both been invited by Gioele to join his mafia-like "Family", and the last days were devoted to plot against Finola, who had asked the mush to convert her and was planning to go back to Sol with some crazy plan to destroy the mush. We ended up tampering with Constipaspore Serum to make it harder for her to act, and then locked her up in the Nexus to stop her from following us to Sol. For Gioele, Derek and I had decided to go back, in the hopes of finding Paola and helping the Rebels. It took some <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/7/d/394de7a0_516.jpg">convincing</a> until Gioele finally believed that I was sane, though.</p><p>While training Derek and plotting with Gioele, I had decided to assume the part of a heart-broken, <span class="tid_strike">slightly</span> completely paranoid gardener, who had frequent <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/9/7/dfbb4e6e_516.jpg">outbursts</a> against the drones and their suspicions <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/5/4/a80269b8_516.jpg">actions</a>. I also had frequent arguments with Finola about her cheating on me with Nils Carlssen, about her decision to become Mush, to use the retro-fungal serum on Derek, or to go back to Sol alone.</p><p>Very conveniently, I ate a fruit that gave me paranoia, a blessing which I refused to let Janice cure until the end of the ship, because it was just too funny. Especially as the illness often kicked in on very appropriate <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/1/f/2eb9641c_516.jpg">occasions</a>, which made it all the more <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/8/e/49b59713_516.jpg">hilarious</a>. Fun fact : messages transformed by paranoia are not affected by the <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/8/3/18bfd345_516.jpg">Patuline scrambler</a>...</p><br><p>So, between hectic <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/3/0/3e7b2652_516.jpg">gardening sessions</a>, unexpected <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/e/c/10847062_516.jpg">paranoia outbursts</a>, fake <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/8/2/3a43e4bd_516.jpg">breakdowns</a> and having fun <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/d/5/cc282d82_516.jpg">firefighting</a> with Groot, I had quite a good time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

My first examination was on Paola which was cut short when they screamed and ran, my second examination was of Frieda, and using some cunning psychology, I gave them a questionnaire of which one question was "are you a mush?". The answer was yes. Early victory. <br>((Paola also turned out to be a mush so I never actually examined a human))</p><p>I asked Frieda for the ultimate favour, the ability to join the collective, be one with them and I was open and honest from the start. By the time I was converted Frieda was a known mush to the crew and I advocated her safety and my own when I asked for the conversion. I became enamoured with the collective consciousness however as beautiful as that siren song was, the rest of the crew just wouldn't shut up.</p><p>I formulated a plan to return to Sol and use my research to pacify the rage flowing through the mush and make them more peaceful while still spreading the mush fungus, the ability to act as a hive mind would have been the next step in evolution for all humanity!</p><p>I thought the crew were behind me and my return to Sol until the crew almost universally started shouting my ideas of returning as a freedom fighter and...</p><p>They tied me up and threw me in the nexus after drugging me.</p><p><strong>Coming soon to a theatre near you</strong><br>Nils chases down the humans on Eden to rescue his former lover from kidnappers.<br><strong>Taken: In Space</strong></p>

                <p>Hello. <br>I was Janice on this ship. <br>The only sane person of course. Because what was written above is obviously a lie. <br>Me? Wildly insane? That sound silly.</p><p>I wasn't a thief! How many times can I sayit? I was a... collector, yes. It suits much better to the situation. My gallery was safe for such a long time, but then of course people started to check Front Storage - I ask why! It is such a safe and boring place, nothing never happening there!</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7098716/Gallery.jpg">Gallery</a></p><p>It was made around Day 8 - so later it looked slightly different. I must say it was beautiful. I even made a place for a cat over there, a few drones visited it from time to time and the only thing I regret is that I didn't find a way to keep them inside. They would be perfect to make my collection more amazing. <br>On the other hand with their program to destroy everything, maybe it's better they were there only from time to time...</p><p>My motive wasn't about the others, so I didn't mess with anyone too much. I also want to apologize for being less active in later days - real life happened, so I wasn't able to pay too much attention to the game. <br>As much it was amazing experience, it was also very tiring. Finding enough time to actually read everything, being updated with all the information and making a proper answer took a lot of time and effort. It was my first attempt with such a jump - but I'm very happy with the results.</p><p>I guess some people deserves a cookie for their devotion to this particular game: Ian, Gioele, Paola, Finola, Stephen, Chun, Kuan Ti - sometimes it was hilarious to read what you made over there. It was a shame to lose Frieda so early... but that actually opened a new ways to deal with certain situations.</p><p>Never the less... It was amazing and I wanted to thank you all <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

It seems we finally made it to Eden after a long and eventful journey. Where to even begin our story?</p><p>First, I must admit something to you and everything will be clear. I am a <strong>fraud</strong>. I completely faked the plans for the Daedalus. At that point in time, I didn’t care about safety or humanity, honestly. I just wanted to see the <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/qg58lcp">stars</a>. I know, I know. I won that contest that Gioele held and his engineers said the blueprints were sound. Well, either they’re the worst engineers ever, too afraid to speak up, or simply didn’t care. Anyways, I had the drones do the rest and they actually built something mostly decent. Then, 16 years later, when myself and crew began to wake up, we started immediately on various Projects. Needless to say, everyone else would have panicked if they knew the ship was barely holding together. That’s why I needed to assure the crew that everything was fine and an <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/p2ml3hn">Anomaly Detector</a> would be unnecessary (although I’m thankful now that we completed that project anyways). Some were <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/op7qket">harder to convince</a> than others...Not to mention when I myself was already proving them <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/on6yrq6">right</a> and that I was perhaps <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/o9lp58l">not as qualified</a> as I should have been. I needed someone to believe me, and that someone was <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/q6yn6xj">Groot</a>.</p><p>I won’t bore you with the same details as Ian explained before, but there was quite the ensuing fiasco concerning ownership of Groot.</p><p>Gradually, I began arguing more and more with NERON (whom I’m convinced <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/ooyf6ay">burnt my favorite cape</a> on purpose) and <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/qdpxz9m">others</a> on the ship, regarding the Daedalus’ “imperfect” design, while getting stalked by the drones on board. It was absolutely <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/q9k9txk">terrifying</a>! Then for some reason, Chun wanted to <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/pkqhxpx">“upgrade”</a> me and revealed a portion of her...chilling origins. Terrence “rebooted” her after she...um...did something not so kind without asking and she seemed to <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/nwhsoqr">think she was one of the drones</a>. After Janice “rebooted” her once more, Chun came to me for an explanation and I accidentally made her <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/nempq6t">cry</a>. But Groot came to my rescue and helped <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/pcdcrea">calm Chun down</a>. I turned the conversation toward Chun, asking her what she remembered of her home and her lab when I unwittingly made Chun cry again as her <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/ne47yo8">memory returned</a> to her and I learned even more <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/nkhsubg">devastating details</a>. However, there was a solution! Just...not the one I was <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/o9mowgz">expecting</a>. And when I asked the rest of the crew for some <em>privacy</em>, they were…<a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/of3u7x2">skeptical of my intentions</a>. Although I can understand Gioele’s concern. I had revealed my darkest secret to him and he was helping me redeem myself instead of wallowing in self-pity, so he thought that I was slipping. But I was trying to do exactly as he said! I was trying to help others rather than merely thinking of myself. It came as quite the shock when Chun announced that she was <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/o28rw3h">pregnant</a>. I knew then that I had to share with her my <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/q93nqxq">past</a>, if I was going to have any sort of future with her. To help ease Gioele’s worries (about me and about his lost daughter Paola), I <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/qa6a6up">suggested</a> that Chun and I ask him to be our child’s <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/ojwnwon">Godfather</a>.</p><p>After that, the ship seemed to calm down, except for some residual drama between Ian and Finola. But, the drones were apparently being directed by NERON to start fires and break doors and equipment around the ship. It frustrated <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/qeebax6">Ian</a> to no end. And even though he was upset with me for “stealing” Groot (which is still a ridiculous notion), he praised me for taking care of Groot! Although NERON deleted the <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/p97r5kk">evidence</a>...Shortly afterward, Ian <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/qzoqkwv">chastised me</a> for being an irresponsible parent and ended up knitting me mittens and a scarf for Groot. I tried to assist later with the fires, but even the ship thought I was <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/okuxbcg">useless</a> (thank goodness for Ian and BatGroot)!</p><p>Then we made the decision to travel to Eden at last. Finola wasn’t entirely happy, but I believe we have found a new and better life in <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/qhzrw3m">paradise</a>.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">This was my first Casting ship with Towards Eden and I must say, it was quite the interesting adventure. I had a lot of fun and I enjoyed everyone’s interactions with each other. I’m really happy that people liked my Groot shenanigans. The death of Groot the First was completely unintentional but it worked for my increasingly neurotic KT’s motive development. And good thing KT was gullible as all get out, otherwise the “Resetting Chun” scenario probably wouldn’t have worked out like it did. Haha. I look forward to the next TE Ulterior Motives ship!</span></p>

Full of wacky people and generally a great time. Once again I rolled alpha mush on a co-op casting ship! <em>(thanks for the 500-cycle distinction TE, geez)</em> Since mush have a tendency to grab the spotlight in co-op RP ships, and I'd already done a couple explorations into why a mush would be benevolent, I tried not to make myself the center of attention. (...too much. I'm still pretty gorram chatty on-ship, heh.)</p><p><strong>Derek's journey</strong> started with a <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/HDh0CP0.png">rude awakening</a>. With only patchy memories of what had happened on Xyloph 17, he came out of cryo in the body of <strong>Paola Rinaldo</strong>, and fainted right away from the shock. Honestly I would have made his true identity obvious as soon as he regained consciousness, except... he <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/ZJ1oNq6.png">woke up in concerned Papa <strong>Gioele</strong>'s arms</a>. He just couldn't do it. Of course Derek knew he'd have to spill the beans eventually, but... maybe he'd find the right moment. So in the meantime, he did his best to <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/2OOqzdT.png">act like he was Paola</a>... which was still pretty obviously fishy. Oh Derek, master of subtlety you are not. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/v6GDzSb.png">first person he consulted</a> was none other than the ship's doctor and Mush expert - <strong>Finola</strong>. Fascinated, she immediately put him under observation. It worked out well both for RP and mechanically, since RNG denied us the bridge sofa with a freak D2 dorm fire. Meanwhile, Gioele probed at his "daughter," <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/6HrYVrY.png">worrying over her</a> while simultaneously trying to give her space. At about the same time, method actor Stephen Seagull, convinced that he was filming a space invaders arc in the soap opera he starred in, tried to act out scenes with his "love interest," Paola Rinaldo. The pressure grew ever greater, and Derek hadn't really wanted to keep up a charade in the first place.</p><p>Gioele tried to chat up his daughter again, and Derek <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/tk9X2AO.png">confessed his true identity</a>. Gioele's rage burst not on him, but on Finola, who had promised him that his little girl was okay when she knew otherwise. (somehow I forgot to cap this, drat. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> ) Then <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/HKqxYOo.png">Derek tried to break the news to Stephen</a>, who became confused about his "co-star's" script and the direction the arc was going. The entire ship soon knew the truth.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/6KZItXe.png"><strong>Ian</strong> seemed to take special interest in Derek</a>, at first very curious about how he was taking the body swap. Derek was rather uncomfortable with all the obvious physical attraction to his new body from Ian, but he still took the excuse to (attempt to) verbally work out his confusion over what this change would mean for the super-heterosexual persona he'd been cultivating his whole life. (He never <em>did</em> sort that out, since there were plenty of pressing issues/events he could justify prioritizing instead.)</p><p>Such as when, near the end of D3, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Frieda</strong> contacted Derek via Mush pheromones, asking for his assistance. Dr. Keegan had actually <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/6PIrhd2.png">asked Derek if he was mush earlier</a>, but the Mycoscan came up clean... so he was definitely human, right?? <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/obxvHqS.png">The revelation was a bit of a shock, as you can see</a>. Gioele tried to help by opening his private stash, but alcohol just doesn't affect a Mush in the same way. (I thought I had this too, but apparently not? Shoot. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> ) Ian was <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/HKE7aKu.png">thrown for a loop</a> given his dislike of mush, but he didn't shun Derek.</p><p>Derek <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/xXRRCLE.png">focused on comms</a>, having <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/Ajxm8lN.png">vowed to Gioele</a> that he would try to find out what had happened to the <em>real</em> Paola, in his body. He got a little bit from the rebel bases, but not much. So <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/8zEsQAy.png">he went to Frieda</a>, asking about how to access the Collective mind, perhaps to find her there. She had begun to instruct him when she was tragically lost on a planet.</p><p>Lost, he continued his work and tried to work out his <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/7E5v7wQ.png">identity issues</a> a little. Gioele began gathering a "Family" of trusted individuals, and saw fit to <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/TSpcRjt.png">invite Derek</a> in spite of everything. Deep inside, Gio's intense demands for loyalty made Derek a bit nervous, but it was really nice to be in the know on something. And Gioele still wasn't mad at him for not being his daughter, so that was always good.</p><p>Finally, Derek went to Finola again. She had taken to surfing the Collective mind like a fish to water, right as soon as she was converted, so maybe she had tips? And she did, which kicked off his search for Paola. <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/3vOEACy.png">He made some interesting discoveries</a>, among them the reason that the hunters were always on the Daedalus' heels.</p><p>Around this time, Ian, <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/tB8Gni7.png">revealed his true identity</a> to Derek... who initially took it for a joke. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Once convinced that Ian wasn't kidding, and that the Crimson Society worked for good, <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/oW9eO4r.png">he was eager to begin training</a>. He already had been feeling a need to take some control over his situation (he had begun working out prior to this), and this was a way he could do it, and help others.</p><p>The search for starmaps soon culminated in the successful triangulation of Eden's location. This immediately led into a <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/O5Spi7y.png">discussion</a> of characters' final plans (<a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/ILN6711.png">Finola had already spoken of returning to Sol</a>, shortly after Frieda's death), and the problem of the hunters' ease in keeping up with the ship. The Patuline Scrambler was discussed, but Derek had only just begun to speak with Paola, and protested. It was delayed.</p><p>But it wasn't too long before Finola asked for lab assistance, and it came out quickly that she was indeed working on the pheromone scrambler. Derek loudly protested, and <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/QWljJpZ.png">Finola took quick action</a>.</p><p>Being cured was... a traumatic event for Derek. Ever since Finola had made the most of Frieda's death, Derek had intended to use it at some point, but not yet, and not without mental preparation. Ian helped him through it with a <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/MUyxdNN.png">bit of booze</a>, and Gioele with a <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/O0jvpfX.png">thoughtful gift</a> as he slept it off.</p><p>With the question of Paola off his mind, Derek <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/8X2VqfQ.png">applied</a> himself fully to his assassin training. Peanutz already shared a couple examples of the training activities that I tossed out into public, but here are a couple more: <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/jJgzlxV.png">Sparring with Chao</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/41OtAFP.png">More Target Practice</a>. They also discussed Finola's Sol return plans, as did Gioele's family circle. Derek was very undecided as to whether he wanted to return to fight or settle on Eden and rest. Meanwhile Gioele also announced his intention to return, and the means he had to counter the numerical advantage of the hostile Mush.</p><p>Finally, Derek agreed to <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/nXYuJP4.png">help Ian and Gioele restrain Finola</a>, intending to go <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/lokoCV4.png">back to Sol</a> as protection for Gioele. He ended up feeling rather badly about it, but stuck to his guns.</p><br><br><p><em>exhales slowly</em> Pheeeew, and that's it! For fun I'll also include the little <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/EZFQGH4.png">rap battle taunt</a> Derek gave Chao (who spoke only in song lyrics) when Chao wouldn't answer whether he wanted to go to Sol or Eden, near the end. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Oh, and <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/yVBwcQN.jpg">Bat-Groot</a>. I have more doodles in progress, but have been too busy to finish them yet. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>

I did wonder what the cat was doing in Front Storage, but so many crazy things were happening on the ship, a lone cat in a storage room was almost normal.

                <p>It was very fun ship had great time with the role-play, which did go way too much over my head XD. Was my second time playing as Chun and 1st time on ulterior motives casting ship, Chunbot idea came out of nowhere really other then when I started the ship I was level 1 Chun and she was obsolete Chun and then rest just followed for reason that I can only explain of watching way too much sci fi stuff. (Terminator franchise, and Star trek the next generation recut&gt;Youtube.)</p><p>I came up with concept that this Chun was a cybernetic organism (Accidently typed orgasm once<img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico">) created by (someone) to replace the original Zhong Chun who is this timeline and universe died during events on Tamina after Zhong Chun accidently created the mush race due to a reaction with her Immune system caused her cough up tiny little spores during encounter in a cave.</p><p>Few months pass and some of team become very sick and ill and complain of headaches unknown to them they where being transformed into the mush…In the panic the human team locks Zhong Chun in the lab where they begin experiments desperate to know what’s going on. This life was very hard for Chun to cope with all constant questions, interrogations and blood samples had finally took it tole on her mind, so she took her own life due to the mental suffering and fact she could not be close her so-called children. However little did she know what would happen next?</p><p>The Mush invasion and mass conversion was on full scale at this point. The last of the humans of the Tamina expo team where desperate to give the humans on Sol some hope and advantage of beating this threat to life, so came up with idea to clone cells and skin of Zhong Chun corpse and create a metal android frame based on the idea’s and drone designs of so called Robotics Expert Terrence Archer, The plan worked and a metal endo-skeleton was full replicated. Next process was more difficult trying to replicate human living tissue, many body parts and organ where re-used from the original Zhong Chun dead corpse and after lots of work a prefect replica of Zhong Chun was made it was somewhat of a success the name of this Model would be called Chun101 by the human research team.</p><p>Next process was create a brain Cpu cortex and use idea’s based on Janice Kent Neron project with a few tweaks such as actually using cloned part of Chun’s brain…this process was never fully correctly finished before they could upload and recalibrate all of the Cpu protocols, the lab was located by the mush and taken over.</p><p>Mush discovered the Chunbot design and thought of the idea of using the concept for there own Invasion, They would use the so called last hope of mankind as their own personal super weapon and cloned and made mass amount of Chunbots for purpose of Infiltration of all the main governments and leaders of earth gathering information and providing mush with huge advantage during the war. <br>They finished of her programming and uploaded there own agenda little did they know it would have a huge effect on her due fact of her having both human and mush files contradicting each other (Her confused and child like manner on the ship).</p><p>(Motive was to locate and Infiltrate project Daedalus and locate the other Mush agents (code name: Children) to convince the humans onboard to be upgraded/converted into mush however she did not know however who these agents where due to the fact of her anti mush human files and mush files conflicting with one another and also the fact she was protoype agent of the mush little knowing of how this Chunbot would perform on the field.</p><p>After some scanning and events on the ship Chunbot located Mush Agent Frieda was discovered and before she could help she was tragically lost on a alien Planet.), During her time on Daedalus and the fact she was not fully completed, Chunbot found very hard to understand her purpose and often went along with what her files told…which caused the Infamous Terrence Archer Indecent which Chunbot.. <em>Bad things. Content deemed too sickening to post.</em></p><p>After a few confrontations with other crew member she often found herself lost in her own world often walking around without clothes (She didn’t understand the point.) Gioele or Gdad as she called him unofficially adopted Chunbot into his so-called family feeling for her/it. Trying to teach, her the basics on human code of conduct. As Chunbot began learning new things she had this feeling something is missing then all of her mush files activated causing her to turn against her fellow crew to try and convert or upgrade them she attack and pinned Kuan Ti and tried to get him to be upgraded/Converted.</p><p>Kuan Ti was saved and by this point Terrence patience with Chubot wore thin.<br>He shutdown Chunbot before she did anymore harm to the crew. Terrence then tried to reprogram Cpu however didn’t quite have the effect he had wanted.</p><p>Chunbot was later reactivated (Basic mode) and started following the onboard drones around and started beeping and trying to repair things by ramming her face into said broken equipment. Janice then decided to give Chun a good old fashioned bash the head hopping to fix her.</p><p>Chunbot again rebooted this time this time though things were very different. Some deep memory of her time before being lab experiment came to the surface and lack of memory to previous events on the ship and being a bot. However she had feeling something was wrong as other crew members where acting strange around her within good reason after events with Kuan Ti and Terrence.</p><p>In her confusion she confided in Kuan TI and his plant called who he called Groot. Where she gained back her memory learned of her origins and her true purpose. Kuan TI and Chun bonded and became good friends Eden was located at this poit but for Chun she was still the work of the humans and mush and had files on her systems Including a self destruct mode which would activate after the ship would land so her technology would not fall into the hands of the enemy mush or human this left Chun and the crew with huge Dilemma.</p><p>Chun managed to come up with a solution but a dangerous one she would try and (merge cells with a human or mush male hoping to cause her systems to overwrite themselves). The problem was that it may not work and cause her to self destruct anyway. Kuan Ti decided despite of his flaws he owed it to Chun to try and fix herself and volunteered.</p><p>Both of them merged cells, (OOC: In real terms at this point I had long chat with Kuan TI about rolling a dice on the outcome and Joked about Chun getting pregnant). It was a success and Chun was saved and er…Pregnant. At this point Chun and Kuan became more then friends and decided to do their best to give this child best start in life but not without difficulties.</p><p>Eden would seem like at great place to escape from the mush and human warzone that was on Sol, Chun knew she could not go back but also knew that the mush and humans would know she was still out there so after talking with Dr. Keegan she suggested that she could replicate a dead part copy of her and bring her back to sol as token of her demise after Hijacking the Daedalus. So she would not be tracked down.</p><p>Rest is all History and sorry for long post and the time it took me to respond here are some of my many Highlights playing as Chun below.</p><br><p>“Chun decides to place Ian’s head in a plant pot to try and calm him down”<br>“Chun decides to try and help Derek become a male again…”<br>“Kuan Ti accidently kills a plant (Groot), after kidnapping and forgetting to treat it (OOC: he was busy in real life but the outburst and rp about afterwards was very funny!)<br>“Gioele creating his so called family of misfits”<br>“Finola getting too close to her own research on the mush was some very dark rp from her and Ian which was great”<br>“Kuan Ti getting chased by the drones”<br>“Ian’s outbursts about things on the ship”<br>“The story about the drones and Neron trying to destroy the ship”<br>“Groot! XD XD”<br>“Freida dying on a planet expo after we had long OOC: discussion about loosing a crew member in a MIA zone”</p><p>And many many more great things!</p><p>Thank you for great time.</p>

                <p>Sadly, I missed this launch. I had been really looking forward to the Ulterior Motives theme, but I was having internet problems. I decided to ready up anyway, hoping it would be fixed soon enough, but there weren't enough players to launch two ships...</p><p>Anyway, I enjoyed reading all the RP screenshots. Thanks for sharing the fun!</p>
