After seeing that only one spore was removed in the entire ship, no wonder the mush hunt was so difficult. Although Janice had been a top suspect for a while it's difficult to find mush when they don't do anything mushy. Although the ship had research done so fast that the mush also didn't have an easy job.</p><p>It's too bad we had the "incident" with the griefer Chao because the ship really promised a lot in the beginning. But even so, we managed to get things around and got a nice victory in a d10 ship.</p><p>Groomsh (and hey! Didn't know you were on the ship!), not that much happened besides the ship starting to fall apart. A few fires, lots of breakdowns, steel plates and room shakes and lots of hunters... the usual. It was getting really hard to find ap to keep the ship and ourselves alive.</p>

                <p>So I was the third person to wake up on the ship, with a TE mini-jump in the works having a mostly empty ship was a bit troublesome as it would be harder for people to line up their choices to my ship because there was barely anyone awake. I took my usual Chun skills Mankinds Only Hope and Lethargic, moved a few items around and grabbed the <em>teddy</em> bed in BD while I awaited selection. Thankfully it was still Day 1 so we had the delicious fruit which somebody planted before daychange.</p><p>D2C1 I think it was was when Mush Selection occurred. I hopped up ran around and found the Mush sample in the rear part of the ship and started working on antimush research. We got the first few bits of research out really fast so I wasn't sure what that meant for the Mush. What I found quite peculiar was the fact that Stephen had uninstalled Alpha Dorms camera pre-mush and went into the medlab and just stood there. I grabbed another camera from CAS and installed it in AD.</p><p>I went with my usual anti-mush chat - Myself and Eleesha. With myself in Bravo Dorm it was quite easy for me to keep an eye on everyone that had been through the room so I was able to keep tabs on everyone. I ended up having to kill Stephen to get that camera back, which was then installed in Nexus.</p><p>A bit later I read the pilot book when I had 22 AP and I managed to empty one and a half patrol ships... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/drowl.gif" alt=":anim_drowl:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The main suspect for us for a while was mainly Chao, we didn't know what he was up to and he was doing weird things like healing people.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"> Eleesha and I had been discussing it privately when suddenly out of the blue Gioele invited <em>everyone</em> except Chao into the chat. A few people protested that it was a bad idea and Jin Su and Gioele were saying we'd be better off killing him sooner rather than later. A few minutes later Chao was invited and got really angry and started a rampage. He said something along the lines of "You definitely have a reason to kill me now!"<br>Jin Su and Gioele were slain.<br>Perfect timing too, because I had just spent all my AP, and Eleesha had determined with some certainty that both Jin Su and Gioele were most likely human... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So eventually Chao was killed and he was human, and this really put a dint in everyones morale (and <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico"> ) so the hunt went on. A few hours later Paola contacted me with the Xyloph list which had Chao as a negative, as well as a few other people who were invited to the 'human chat'.</p><p>It was about Day 5, starving day when Eleesha gave me the run-down on the people that had been to grab food and who hadn't.<br>Everyone except Kuan Ti. I shrugged and awed for a while until we agreed that there was a good bet he was Mush. A few stabs later, followed by a few 'For Delzoup' cries showed we had 1 dead Mush. Roland got a mental disease too, and I joked that it could be Patryk because at a similar time he posted on the Q&amp;A about faking a mental illness as mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> But he was cured by Janice a few cycles later and into the human chat he came.</p><p>Paola had constantly been contacting me every now and then concerning new pieces of information she had gathered or concerns she had. I always made a mental note before thanking her and closing the tab (incase somebody needed to contact me) and she had the impression I didn't trust her.<br>In all honesty, I didn't trust anyone. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/keepcool.png" alt=":K" class="tid_ico"><br>I was fairly sure there had been no conversions (which I was right about) because the mush were playing sneakily, and I hadn't seen enough evidence to suggest that she was Mush so I some-what trusted her. She suggested that I start a small anti-much hunt (which I already had) and I think she got a bit frustrated when she hadn't been invited. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway moving right along I had just finished another lehtargic run and I was completely spent when suddenly mutant Raluca barged into Bravo Dorm and slapped Eleesha <em>once</em>.<br>I screamed out to everyone saying so but nobody was online at the time. I took my chances, got up and stabbed <em>once</em> and got a critical hit, instantly killing her. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> With no death announcement I looked at the Nexus logs and learned that Janice had fiddled with the bios before extracting, spiking and transferring into Raluca. I told the crew we were probably Mush free now and a few cycles later Eleesha confirmed it.</p><p>So we were down to 8 people left. Hua, Roland, Eleesha, Finola, Ian, Frieda, Paola and myself. With 10 plants and oxy ducts we were pretty much good for O2 so Frieda could take her time while looking for planets. It was pretty much a casual road from there on out, I did a few heal runs (if there is ever a medic book for a lethargic Chun oooh boy) and we held out till D10C8 when we decided to head home shortly after Finola's death. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Overall, fun ship, unfortunate about what Chao did but we managed to hold on. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>It wasn't a true mush hunt chat. It was a chat that Gioele started and invited everyone but Chao into it to discuss killing Chao. Chao was doing some suspicious stuff like holding the medikit for a day or two (although he did a couple of heals in that time), picking a mycoalarm without being asked to, entering bravo dorm. Despise that, I didn't believe Chao was mush and kept discussing it with Chun (and only Chun, not in any open PM).</p><p>But Gioele, instead of taking the matter privately to Chun decided to do it openly, if Chao was mush, his partner would have been alerted. If Chao was just a bad player (or griefer like he turned to be), it still was a bad idea to do that open forum since he wasn't damaging the team too much and there was no need to alert the entire crew (mush included) about him.</p>

                <p>Hey! I was Janice! First time playing her and second time Alpha Mush (ninth game ever, I only started playing Mush two months ago). I was only level 4 too and the research team was such a powerhouse, there really wasn't much that Kuan Ti and I could do without exposing ourselves between five cameras from Paranoid Gioele, the MycoAlarms, a Lethargic Chun always watching Bravo Dorm, and the most active crew I have seen to date. So I tried passing suspicion onto Chao and Raluca, primarily.</p><p>I had some experience banked so I leveled myself a couple of times in case I needed Splashproof mostly. But it turned out that Transfer was kind of handy. I misjudged how much AP Raluca had so that's why I could only hit Eleesha once. I knew I wasn't going to survive or kill anyone so I had a little fun mutating. And wow, Chun, a critical! I was impressed. I'm glad I got to be killed by you!</p><p>I felt bad for Chao though. I do think he handled the situation poorly but it wasn't entirely his fault. I was most definitely passing off suspicion onto him. Not that it really helped me. Haha. And I didn't invite Chao to the Whisper discussing him, although I have no idea if Kuan Ti did. I was just getting up for work when that fiasco went down. So I figured my best bet to stay alive and keep my cover was to go to Chun and call and Ceasefire (not that I really wanted to use it on her, sorry!). I picked up the armor in case Chao went to Bravo Dorm and attempted to kill me just to delay my possible demise before I could call a Ceasefire, since I was about to head to my job IRL. You have to refresh the game constantly, otherwise you won't know that someone followed you to a room and started beating on you. I just didn't want Chao to get lucky and kill me and expose my Mushiness. Which just made me look more suspicious.</p><p>As for my own AP expenditure, yes, I was without a bed most of the time, but I did go up to the Bridge and comfort Paola and Frieda three times each (I read the whisper chat and that's the information the Mush Hunt Team was missing). And I wasn't doing projects much because A) I didn't have a bonus at all on the projects we were working on and B) no one was relaying for me (especially after Kuan Ti died, but I attempted to blame Raluca since she would access the Core and either not advance projects or not report that she worked on them) and Eleesha wasn't having any of my nonsense. Nonetheless, I don't think I could have kept my cover for long since it was down between me and Hua. All in all, I think it ended well, even if it meant I died. The crew was amazing, truly.</p><p>I hope that I'll get to play with you fine people again in the future! Also, it's such a surprise to see that I ended up on a ship with another from Schrodinger's Army after I just joined. Hello again, Mandy!</p>

That being said, when you started messaging me in a PM about your suspicions, I told Chun that I suspected of you being Mush. We hadn't talked much about anything on the ship, and you started pushing your suspicions pretty heavily with me, which is what made me suspect you more. Just a thought for the future.</p><p>I wish we had had better luck with planets, but all in all this was a good chance for me to flex my Paola muscles a bit (I don't play her often) and to enjoy a ship that wasn't swimming in inactives.
