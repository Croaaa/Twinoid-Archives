I was Jin Su.</p><p>First things first, both mush got killed before the first day finished. Chao went on a rampage as soon as the hiding of both blasters was accidentally mentioned. He saved ap beforehand, shot down Terrence then went against...Chun I think? She lived trough it, and the situation settled in a room with Ian, making any attempts against him cost FIVE AP. Still, he was tired, and we were many after Ian moved, costing huge to punch him, but it happened. After that the other mush, Stephen, who was found dirty without a reason on the same day, said that please give him the serum as he gives up on the first day. Can't say I blame him as he was going to get killed later on anyways. He died on the second day.</p><p>Well then! We were on the second day, no mush. What could go wrong? Technically...nothing. As in nothing happened. At all. There were expeditions, there were scans and projects, but nothing spectacular happened. Except we lost 2 people, Roland and Finola to a bug that made the whole planet a MIA zone, zones that we couldn't explore to save them. This was a bug with Roland's sprinter skill according to other people, and we could do nothing against it, apart from watching Roland's morale get lower, and Finola getting instakilled when found.<br>I would like to point this again, <em>we found a bug that killed crewmembers, screenshots were taken and it can be used to prevent it happening with other people</em>. Twinoid is supposedly contacted about it, but I can't be too sure.<br>Explorations happened but planets were only okay-ish, and we only had one starmap from all the expos. Damn aliens even stole the Babel Module!</p><p>And....that's all I can say really. It strengthened my opinion that this game needs a Mush enemy, and MMM ships are great/boring at the same time when nothing happens on the first 10 days, then it becomes a "who has AP to heal/extinguish". <br>For me it was actually an bad experience, waiting for RNG to throw a bone at us all the time so we can do something. I don't know if I want to wait for the next season, or start a new, non-MMM now where I can be a mush, or play a more even interesthing field. But that's my opinion so enough about that.</p><p>About the crew. Hehe. I choose Jin Su because I had enough of slow commanders that hindered the ship's progress. Same reason that I rarely see a Jin Su alive on most ships. Here we had an active crew <em>(everyone say with me: Kuan Ti! Kuan Ti!)</em> that made progress quickly and successfully. Projects were completed quickly, only plasma shield took a while, research was...well 90% of it was only done for glory and fun as the mush died about the time when anstispore was done. I can't say a bad for them.</p><p>...</p><p>But I'm a commander so I will. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br>I think they had the same problem as me, since everyone, and I do mean everyone lost interest as time progressed. In the beginning all of them were active, both in action and communication. Janice made NERON jokes, people tried to roleplay and have fun a little, I poked at all the girls on the ship, Roland made pun jokes, things like that. Later on, it only came down to bare essentials, telling what needing to be done and be gone with it. Kuan Ti was the only one who made an effort later on, grats for that, most people on reacted to me or him, nothing else happened.</p><p>The funny thing is that they insisted on moving on and lengthening the journey all the time when returning to Sol came up, but then rarely acted on it. Things were done, but only when it wasn't urgent, like collecting scrap before new wave arrives. I still don't understand their logic but oh well, I talked with Kuan TI that maybe some people needed to die to see how close we were to dying the last 2 days when a double hunter wave would have killed us, or if I didn't move the ship every 3-4 cycles (and the necessary repairs-fuel needing it).</p><br><p>So... share your opinions about this my dear crew, why was I wrong. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Oh and be sure to check your ranking, I'm suprised that I got 24th on the all time ranks when I barely did anything glory-related. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hi! Kuan Ti here.</p><p>You really did a great AP here.</p><p>When I first got one the ship, we had 6 GOLD projects already. And the ship was so super active during the first 2 cycles. Unfortunately, things went silent after that. We had a good crew, but co-ordination was lacking.</p><p>It was sad that we probably lost 4 of our best players so early on, which meant the ship couldn't hit Eden. We also had a run of bad luck with RNG with no fuel, so we had to delay doing expo for a few precious days.</p><p>Chao was lost because he became Mush. He took out Terrence, one of our Gold players that was active, so it was a double blow. Then came the ridiculous double blow of losing our two best and brightest players in the form of Roland (our then de-facto Leader) and Finola (our Diplomat). We never really recovered from that blow. <em>All Fug(U)Gon(e) planets are hereby banned on my future ships!</em></p><p>Gioele came online on D7 (I think), but his activities was only in short spurts. Overall, that sort of described the whole crew. No one was idle, but they were only able to come online perhaps in 3 cycles in a single day. Whilst that was fine from D1~D13, things got hairy later on. Especially with 5x fires, being steel plated, ceiling breaking, both O2 tanks breaking, 30+ Hunter waves at each turn.</p><p>Jin Su did a fine job of coming on during crucial times to move the ship or we would never have survived. I am glad the crew came alive during the last 2 days and everyone pitched in to help.</p><p>Overall, this ship held such great promise, but we never really recovered from the lost of Roland and Finola. Still, it was a fun MMM ship, my very first one. We did good and perhaps we'll meet on another ship to Eden in Season 2.</p>

                <p>Nothing happened? You besides the RNG screwing us over at every turn?</p><p>Raluca here. You forgot one forgot another important thing that MUSH-Chao did. He killed my cat.<br>He started his rampage with a grenade in Bravo Dorm with Kuan-Ti, Hua and Terrence, and then finished off Terrence. If Stephen had actually tried to help instead of hoping we'd cure him, then maybe they could have done more damage. (Stephen even helped us kill Chao.)</p><p>Anyways, thing SHOULD have been good at this point. 6 Gold Projects, and active crew and no MUSH on day 1.<br>But then RNG decided it was bored and started to get nasty.</p><p>Let's see, almost EVERY expo we went on had a member go missing (and then there was the triple MIA planet that took Finola and Roland.) That never really stopped. Although we did get a starmap.<br>The RNG setting fires in the Hydroponic Gardens almost every other cycle to burn our plants. (We have Heat Lamps.)<br>Focus fire room shake and sheet metal nailing people before day 10 (and it just got worse.) Hua ended up getting taken out at one point. I still don't know if Hua was just quiet or had a tongue injury. (You can preform surgery on yourself to fix that, for future reference.)<br>Large hunter groups, even earlier than I remember.</p><p>I've been on a day '20' ship before, and this was worse. It was like the RNG was ahead of schedule.</p><p>I do agree that MMM ships are boring once the MUSH are dead. (Even with a very active and vindictive RNG.) I still believe that Chao and Stephen could have done more. I don't know if they weren't communicating or what, but there isn't a reason to do a rampage on day 1. <br>I blame Stephen more than Chao though. Apparently, Stephen convinced Chao to rampage, then seemed like he was trying to get cured, which is sanctionable.<br>If Chao was seemingly alone, and with us completing so many research projects early, I can understand the rampage. However, at LEAST they should have done a cycle 8-day change MUSH conversion to have 3 MUSH before the rampage. Or just laid low. As a potential second in command (and Stephen is high on many title lists) they were in a good position to get control of the ship. Oh well.</p>

                <p>Wow..sounds like things were pretty rough. I was pretty pissed at Chao, as you can see in the end game results. I tried to load mush from my phone during my lunch break but it froze on a "You are dead!" screen. I assumed it was trying to load the end game screen from my last ship where I died so I deleted my cache, restarted my phone and tried again..only to find another "You are dead!" screen with Terrence's face on the side. I only had five minutes of lunch left so I wasn't able to read much aside from Chao killing me, but yeah..that kind of ruined my day. My next ship cheered me up, but I kept glancing at the 'My File' tab wondering how you guys were doing..and now I know!</p><p>I can't believe Stephen tried the "Um..I don't know. I just am!" dirty approach. And you say he begged for the cure? That's just sad. Well, I hope I get to actually fly with you guys someday.</p>

                <p><strong>Olsheep</strong>: I hoped it didn't sound like an attack, but I really do feel that after the first few days, things got quiet quickly. Now this was okay since things got done, but at a slower pace, which would be still okay if people didn't insist on going along, then not planning to do so.<br>For example, most of the time I tried to state that I'll do something later on that'll need help. Scrap collection was mentioned a few times that someone needs to help in the same cycle, but nobody went out. A day before that, someone else mentioned that we'll need lots of metal as we didn't had plasma shield yet. We missed a few cycles when nobody loaded the fuel, but 99% of the time I was grateful that we were able to do it in a short time, a cycle or two. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Again, it was fine since I could understand why, but it really did feel like that Kuan Ti, Me made most of the threads, with Gioele and other expo members, like you, talking about it later, or barely at all.</p>

                <p>I disagree. It can FEEL like you are the one that has to do everything, but that usually isn't the case.</p><p>As proof, note how many researches, projects and expeditions we did. Plus the fact that we survived so long.</p><p>What happened is certain people made a plan, and others didn't follow it. That's the fault of those who made the plan, that they assumed that others would go along with it.</p><p>Also, are you really telling us that we didn't communicate? After the chat logs lagged us to heck?</p><p>I will agree that people seemed to give up on RPing at all after a certain point. We pushed ourselves and it wasn't really fun at points. But everyone did what they could. It's just that the RNG made us have to react a lot.</p>

All I was saying is that whilst ALL members of the crew contributed, some members went about doing their own thing (both valuable in their own right), but without proper co-ordination. Yes, Frieda you did good, but we wouldn't know since you were quiet at times. Obviously, it didn't help that the main public comms was filled with the initial &gt;100 messages on D1C1-C2 chatter from the excitement of being on an MMM ship.</p><p>It's ok to just voice out your perspectives to see how we can improve in the future. After all hindsight is 20/20, so it would be good to know.</p>

Funny how it's mirrors what happened there. All I was saying is that whilst ALL members of the crew contributed, some members went about doing their own thing (both valuable in their own right), but without proper co-ordination. Yes, Frieda you did good, but we wouldn't know since you were quiet at times. Obviously, it didn't help that the main public comms was filled with the initial &gt;100 messages on D1C1-C2 chatter from the excitement of being on an MMM ship.</p><p>It's ok to just voice out your perspectives to see how we can improve in the future. After all hindsight is 20/20, so it would be good to know.</p></cite><p>I understood what you meant just fine.</p><p>Look, this is a social game. The skillset it requires is fairly limited. Once all the mushes are dead, it basically boils down to how much free time you've got to trudge through piles of messages from anonymous strangers.</p><p>You're free to think we weren't communicative enough but I can assure you it won't help anyone improve.</p><p>Now, I too could play the blame game here or I could try to come up with excuses to defend myself but, frankly, I don't see the point in focusing on the negative. It's just bringing me down for no good reason.</p><p>All in all, it was an awesome ship and I'd fly again with most of you in a heartbeat.</p>

                <p>Hey guys, Chun here. I think all in all we did pretty well! Sure, no Eden, but 19 days with 10 people, every available research complete, all but 1 of the possible projects and virtually no deaths that could have been avoided - considering how bad the RNG was and how incredibly bad the lag was getting I'd say returning to Sol intact was a big win!</p><p>It's no surprise that we weren't as roleplayey towards the end. There was a lot of communication to wade through. I think a lot of us probably just quietly got on with our jobs. I know I did because if I let anyone know I was online I'd get told what to do with all my points. You've got to understand that that really sucks the fun out of a game quickly.</p><p>All in all, though, it was good times and I hope to see most of the crew on another mission sometime! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>P.S. My boots are pretty sweet, you guys.</p>

                <p>Heh, I am a "efficency freak" in planning that's true. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br>Although I must say that you said you were a bit new and lost with your character (I'm 90% sure but I could be wrong of course as it was some time ago.), and the crew didn't took the lead or argued with our plans. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>One other thing for Frieda and everyone else: I did not have that chat bug you mentioned, so I can easily imagine why would that be a problem with your communication. Once my chat log got wiped but after a while it fixed itself again. I suprisingly had little lag overall, especially when compared to the MMM ship before that where it actively hindered the game. So I do understadn your stances about the topic. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Nope, not me - been playing since the beginning! Also, can you get lost playing as Chun? She's like the simplest character - all she has to do is not die, really! That was probably the problem with me - wasn't required on trips or needed for the general running of the ship, so things got pretty dull pretty quickly and I just had to busy myself with research, healing, fixing and fire extinguishing.</p><p>I guess since I just got on with it (you guys have no idea just how many things I fixed!) people maybe wondered where all my AP was being spent... It wasn't really you to be honest - more Kuan, but I guess I can understand it.</p><p>I have no-one else to blame but myself, really - next MMM I'll choose a more exciting character... and probably become Mush!</p>

                <p>Gioele here, (Hands off that coffee, fiend!) great AP and summed up most of it, but of course I have a couple bones to pick with ya Jin, heh. First though, ill say: was my first MMM ship and was an interesting experience! (in stark contrast to my usual half empty ships).</p><p>Jin you did great for the most part- we never had to wait long to move and we (I think) only ever needed to hack the bridge once, although that might have had more to do with a hack hungry crew heh. Thing is It never really felt like you were commanding or leading us, just sorta sat back and went with the flow. Nothing against the soft touch but one of Jin most underrated abilities, is being the commander and having a certain authority over the ship (more so than, oh say, a trumped up fashion designer <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> hehehe). Most important thing to do as Jin is motive and get the crew organized, and sadly this was mostly done by ourselves on an individual level. Still, you're the second best Jin I've ever flown with, don't get me wrong <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>As for coming on at D7 that's not really fair to say.. I was quite active for the first 3 days (I bought one of the gold projects, took down a majority of Chaos health thanks to saved AP, coffee, and solid trait getting through his Armour- and ran a bunch of odd jobs). Sadly I had to move on D4, and internet took ages to get back up. (I even signed on at the seediest looking cyber cafe ever to keep myself alive!). but yea that 3-4 day absence sucked, sorry about that.</p><p>Regarding our overall activity well, it seemed to me, every single person was incredibly active (except Hua). Posts don't exactly equal work done after all. With exception to my 3 day braindead spell, I don't think I ever went over my 14 AP limit, and I think the same could be said for almost everyone, again, with exception to Hua... is still a mystery what happened with her, still active for days but not talking, only to starve in front corridor. Not having Hua or Roland really did put the most stress on our backup pilots. Frieda and Jin did a hell of a job picking up the slack.</p><p>Which brings me to the RNG.. yea it was abnormally ill tempered, screwing us over on Eden. The thing is even with a lousy RNG, everyone was active and did their jobs in a timely manner, and events that would have crippled most ships were quickly handled with minimal emergency. MMM crews really highlight where Mush is lacking (moreso than braindead ships where you can only really guess at what you're missing.) It seems pretty clear they need more late game content for ships like ours... after a while with the lag, horribly bugged general chat, and lack of tension it just sorta grinds you down. Planet scanning was a huuuge AP suck.. even with caffeine junky. Rng really reared it's ugly head to me privately on scans.. I think once I trashed 5 in a row, and it loved to throw me Mankarogs or Volcanos on the last tiles :/</p><p>Seeing as this is (english) Twinoid I think it's just as pointless putting suggestions in suggestion thread as it is here, but near the end I was really wishing for a change of scenery. Being able to go on planet/starbase expos on separate random maps (and predefined "special maps" ), using actual AP points to fight/explore/etc.. that's the ticket for late game content for crews like us. Until then I hope to see you all on another ship sometime, with me for a Mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
