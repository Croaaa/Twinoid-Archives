                <p>- - - - - - -<br>- - - - - - -</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">The Ship:</span></p><p>So, our ship started semi-active: First ones to wake up according to chat-log (or their activity-level, to be more precise) were Terrence (more experienced with Astropad-addon links), Andie (quickly taking out hunters), &amp; Chun (with a newbie-thread). By Day1-Cycle4 Raluca had woken up, another more experienced player apparently.</p><p>I woke up around at this point (still as a Bronze-player) and took shelter at the bridge to wait rest of the crew to wake up. To avoid overflows with AP and MP alongside killing time, I ‘ve some time killing Hunters (huehue).<br>After some conversation, I decided to get the Gold-account, if not mainly due getting Logistics Expert, but also because “the offer was so good I couldn’t say no” (I just really like the way Twinoid only “makes” you pay only for the actual days you’re playing, alongside various other nice perks).</p><br><p>Around Day 2, everyone had woken up, Hua &amp; Eleesha being the last two (in that order, more than likely).<br>Chun at this point got killed by Hua. Hua angers me and I’ll go smacking her at the MedLab due being impulsive (but especially push her off the bed). Before all this, she had taken all the blasters (according to Terrence (in a “monitoring-channel-sans-Hua”) and hidden them far too well for us to have energy (nevermind motivation) to search for them.<br>Eventually she was killed by Janice more than likely, due Kuan-Ti’s copypasta.</p><p>So right of the beginning things were pretty much SNAFU, to put it into Yank-militaristic-terms. At this point the activity levels simply bombed, and only the most dedicated (and somewhat stealthy) players were staying active.<br>i personally kept taking requests what do at the Communication Station (at this point we didn't have sofa-yet).</p><p>Days went by, quite uneventfully (chat-wise mainly). Our crew did an expedition bringing in important oxygen, and that’s pretty much it.<br>Mush had a plan to hyperfreeze large amount (+7) of spoiled steak, which was foiled because Neron had Foodstuff Destruction left ON, and Terrence hadn’t checked the BIOS-setting earlier.</p><p>At one point, Engine Room was caught in fire. I waited two cycles until I simply ran out of patience and rushed to kill off the fire (Astropad and semi-actively updating Terrence helped quite a lot, sans the Support-drone location…). I got the fire killed (without even getting dirty), and reported the whole room being broken. Eventually Terrence got active again (after which he pretty much stayed until the the end) and we got the equipments fixed (two turboed support drones sure helped).</p><p>Days went by again, and mush-people started to become more talkative in public again. We started to run out of oxygen before having semi-self-sustaining (risky 7 nick-of-time) greenhouse.</p><p>Before I could get into hacking the Command Terminal, I had to get a good rest both in.game in-real-life (of which I did tell about to others, sort of; let’s just say that I had planned to return earlier, but Frieda).<br>During this, Frieda left the bridge, since we didn’t have camera anymore due Terrence’s-meddlings.</p><p>While resting, I was being Demoralized; slightly fixed this with a pill i had nicked earlier from MedLab (without updating Astropad / inventory).</p><p>After resting, i started the hacking operations:<br>After my (4) attempts to hack the command terminal and not needing to turn the ship (it was already heading to West, where we were supposed to go), we were on our way to the Crameide Secondus.</p><p>In the end, I ended up dying by trying. I admittedly was simply infuriated that people “played normally” despite the deliberate SNAFU-beginning. One could say “well, it’s part of the game”, except that it was done in a way SDF / developers are not condoning with.<br>As I had deducted, Roland indeed had been turned into Mush during his inactivity time. And after (a mush) killing Frieda he tried to persuade me simply “giving up” and picking up the rope at Icarus Bay (which I knew would have trapped / spored, more than likely).<br>Due my frustration, I decided to try delay or end the game on my part right away: Plan was to take off with a patrol ship either right away while Daedalus was in motion (thus get abandoned) or get to orbit and “morally die” in shuttle while still as human. I decided to risk it right away to see if the BIOS lock would have been released (Terrence was the Administrator at this point after all). Unfortunate to me, it wasn’t, so I went to look into Nexus: All machines were malfunctioned…As a good citizen however, I still reported those devices to Terrence’s “horror” (since we had two support- drone, one the might had Pathfinder-upgrade). <br>I went to the Icarus Bay and instantly hid to rope. Then I went to rest at Bravo Dorm, where Jin Su and Roland were resting.</p><p>So, on the next cycle, I flirted Roland at Icarus Bay (just for the sake of wasting AP). And of course, they had searched for the the rope (or I might have missed the “hidden”-icon almost outside the “monitor”), so i picked it up...which actually may not have been spored! Roland suddenly get very eager to go Bridge, but I simply told him that I was out energy (or simple, that I cramped). just before the expedition started, I “dropped” (read: Hid) the rope once again, even saying that I spotted it, which turned out to be just a wire mesh (in reality, Roland might have been in low AP too, so he didn’t search for it before the expedition started).</p><p>Thus the expedition started, spacesuit on and hacker-kit in my pockets…<br>At this point I was hoping to get MIA and simply badly enough wounded have the game end for my part. But there wasn’t enough zones to wound me that bad...and we kept getting “lucky” (found an artifact in a cavern, Roland was “sickened”, but since he was already a mush…).<br>Only single zone (forest) had a chance of getting MIA, and even that was slim, according to records…<br>Typical luck of mine, we ended up picking up a large amounts of fruits (especially since I had studied Botany, just in case…) and returned safely to Daedalus.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">The expedition in question:<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10289" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/10289</a></span></p><p>I supposed broke Roland’s heart by also telling him that that i was about AP when we got back to the bay, most stinging thing being that the artefact we found was Rolling Boulder. i hadn’t told him yet that I had also taken pills and eaten good already too…</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">I am a cruel, horrible person…what indeed I have become of...<br><a href="http://pavementman.tumblr.com/post/92686511640/pave-a-code-crusher" target="_blank">http://pavementman.tumblr.com/post/92...</a></span></p><p>At this point I had only 3-units of morale left.<br>And now 2, because on next cycle death of Ian was announced…His last words to me privately essentially were: “Don’t turn”.<br>Oddly enough, Giolele was also assigned as new commander...<br>As of my final act, I planned to assemble a grenade (how anti-climatic). So, during this cycle (8 of Day 7) I picked up the Rolling Boulder and “rolled” to Alpha Storage to pick up the grenade blue-print. Of course, this room was still broken, so i wasn’t able to get the gasoline / fuel from there. Dropped the boulder and took the blueprint. Then I rested at Bravo Dorm, which to my surprise was empty...It appears it’s Ronaldo doing the dirty work here, so he could be still at MedLab currently, (I deducted this because he also did pick-up a blaster form one of his stashes at Icarus Bay and had Shooter-skill, alongside Pilot &amp; Sprinter). So, it could possible to do a semi-tragic-ending for this voyage...<br>Only guaranteed way to find Roland would be to find my iTrakie again, which I had dropped at Front Corridor…</p><p>And then I realized that the day was about to change, and morale would drop to zero: So I ate the pillow...which was the Teddy Bear! And then I choked!! The end!!! Everyone died!!! YAAAAAAY!!!!!</p><p>And now i have a feeling that I semi-indirectly left Roland to be one of the the most loneliest or at least romantically broken mush in this game (he really wanted to do it as a morale boost, and not wanting me to lose as a human).<br>...Maybe he shouldn't have killed Ian for the bed...<br>...But then again I didn't have to risk of getting both food-poisoned by spoiled steaks and Black-Tongue from a fruit, both which I picked up from Icarus Bay...</p><p>- - - - - - - -<br>- - - - - - - -</p>

                <p>And here we have a “CTRL + W”-addon-list, which sums up quite well the communication-level in this ship alongside some summaries of players from my point of view (the number were recorded just before I went to the expedition with Roland), but afterwards it was only some random PILGRIM-progress (supposedly 60%) and “we go for a expedition, okay”-chat):</p><br><p><em>Total: 517 (public) messages</em></p><p><strong>Paola : </strong> <em>108</em> messages<br>Obviously I was also making some general Announcements for fun too. And most of the times my posts might have gotten far too long-winded, so I chopped them into parts from time to time.</p><p><strong>Neron : </strong> <em>74</em></p><p><strong>Frieda : </strong> <em>56</em> messages<br>Although she did do her usual planetary-scanning-reports, during the last 2-final-days, she turned much more active chat-wise, especially now that Stephen was dead. Unfortunately she (like many others from time time) didn't seem to pay attention to chat-logs to “finest-details”, or even on some of the cases the “top”-posts.<br>She was more than likely killed in action when she tried to go after Terrence (saying he didn't know that we knew), even when I personally had tried earlier to persuade that we and Mush-could co-exists and maybe reach Sol-together. Alas, especially she and many of the mush (aside the the one with pyromaniac, more than likely) didn't agree for this deal...<br>She blew an asteroid into smithereens during the last-before-the-very-last-before-she-perished raid, so i guess that makes semi-awesome.</p><p><strong>Chun : </strong> <em>40</em> messages<br>Certainly Chun could have more active player than I was, or at least quite as chatty. But her assassination by “you-know-who” pretty much doomed this trip right of the beginning this my main talking buddy from the beginning...</p><p><strong>Roland : </strong> <em>40</em> messages Decently active both chat and game-wise, but ended up being turned into mush (more than likely also picked up Anonymush, but not quick enough for me to notice when the transformation happened earlier; I kept mouth shut for the most part about this (the “Comrade/crew-indicator anomaly, not that Roland indeed was suspicious when visiting me at Bridge after Terrence took-away the camera...)<br>Eventually succeeded to persuade Paola picking up rope and even told he had persuaded other (5) mush to convert me via private channel.</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti : </strong> <em>40</em> messages Reported about projects and such a lot “soloer”, Was even infected / spored, but at this point he pretty much was also inactive.</p><p><strong>Terrence : </strong> <em>38</em> messages Very ninja-active, but apparently wasn’t all that talkative due “mush-agency”.</p><p><strong>Raluca : </strong> <em>22</em> messages Experienced and active at start, but went inactive after few days.</p><p><strong>Ian : </strong> <em>21</em> messages Well, he was as active as botanist could, even if in most of the cases there wasn’t much for him to input chat-wise.<br><strong>Gioele : </strong> <em>21</em> messages First active, then inactive half-way, then return for a cycle or two, then stayed inactive again at Engine. Didn’t even bother drinking the coffee i brought close to him...</p><p><strong>Derek : </strong> <em>17</em> messages Quite active, and unfortunately victim of Rolands both food-testing identification and eventual (mush-hunt)-slaughter (yes, he was the first killed mush).</p><p><strong>Jin Su : </strong> <em>14</em> messages Was active, then went inactive for several days, then returned once (and likely being “Transferred” at one point), became completely inactive again. Was turned into immortal-mush to try prevent moving the ship via title-change / new-commander.</p><p><strong>Andie : </strong> <em>12</em> messages Mainly Hunter-hunting talk, but became inactive, killed by Derek alongside Janice in Bravo Dorm.</p><p><strong>Janice : </strong> <em>11</em> messages semi-active’ish, but ended up abandoning the ship while also getting killed by Derek, alongside Andie in Bravo Dorm (under cameras too).</p><p><strong>Hua : </strong> <em>2</em> messages</p><p><strong>Stephen : </strong> <em>1</em> message Did Only the the tutorial and abandoned us at the bridge while still “stealing” Logistic Expert-buff and “finally” dying due hunger around day 5.</p><p><strong>Eleesha : </strong> <em>0</em> messages Oddly enough, she had Melting Hearts, but otherwise didn’t play after spawning...</p><br><p><span class="tid_sideNote"> Favorite quote of mine written by me:<br>“<strong><em>Space, the n'th frontier. These are the voyages of the spaceship Daedalus...as soon as they would the sparkplug, that is…</em></strong>” -The Last General Announcement</span></p><br><p>Now, there are few very important general things I’ve learned ( and hopefully) remember next time:<br>- Always eat rations or anything “sating” last, especially in case of coffee<br>- Only one pill-per-cycle<br>- Study pathfinding even more and always check the shelf to avoid MP-losses<br>- As amazing ACTOPI Protocol is, it’s a” two-sided-sword”<br>- Do even more calculation than ever. But still remember that due living &amp; especially moving- nature of this game, things can get even worse or at least turn to be against oneself...</p><br><p>Hopefully you found this essay somewhat entertaining. And I apologize for repetitions and such; i pretty much wrote this whole thing “from bottom to up”.</p><p>While this more than likely will be my first &amp; last non-custom / casting-ship, it was an experience none the less.<br>I can't really say if it fun or not - scratch that, I did <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> enjoy this session pretty much at all for obvious reasons.<br>But, the positive thing is that I did better hang of the mechanics and generally “better” at this game. So more than likely I’m going to enjoy the playing in future ships a lot more (especially since they’d be filled with more dedicated players, or at least there’s a much higher chance of it).</p><p>Anyways, I think that’s all I think of write for now about this trip for this post.<br>If there are questions, clarifications and such, I’m oddly enough more than eager to answer them.<br>- - - - - -- -<br>- - - - - - - -</p>

Most random ships aren't that bad. A lot of great players still prefer random ships. Anyway, this is a very nicely written AP thread.

                <p>In case someone wonders, I'm actually waiting for the chance of launching the first researching-ship, once there's enough members in "<em>Department of Mush Research</em>"-casting-group. Mainly this is due to not risking of not being "ready" to board the ship while being in another random-public-ship.</p><p>Two first ships I was on were simply "pure misfortune", yes,. But using casting-group still is the possibility to decrease the risks, however.</p><p>Also using using this "off-time" for any other organizing things such, so yeah; I won't indeed let this unlucky streak to stop me, so no worries.</p>
