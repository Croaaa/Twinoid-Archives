                <p>D19C8 – Reactor Room – Twenty minutes until cycle change.</p><br><p>"We can't hold Raluca, they're gonna be through next cycle, that's assuming, the hunters don't destroy us then."</p><p>Four living crew members, two of which are Mush. Twelve deceased, four of which were Mush.</p><p>"We are at 97% repair completion, Chun. Next cycle I can gurantee it will be up."</p><p>Raluca had been near destroyed by a rampaging Mush only three cycles earlier, only Chun's knifework had kept her health from dropping it's last four points. The medkit and medbay were not options, both were on the other side of the ship.</p><p>"Well, little good that does. We won't survive that long." It was at this point, that Chun's iTrackie decided to flare to life; "You are right, just give up. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">" the message was listed as being sent by Eleesha Williams, though she had originally been the wheelchair-bound Terrence Archer.</p><p>"Terry, I see you are still kicking, enjoying walking again?" Zhong Chun, formerly Mankind's Only Hope, spat back at the radio.</p><p>The communicator spat out another smiling emoji.</p><br><p>D19C8 – Ship hull at 5% – Nine minutes until cycle change.</p><br><p>Chun thought hard, there was no way that Raluca could do the last or the repairs before the clock ticked over, she had consumed fruit and a standard ration just to get it to where it is now. The commander couldn't give her a directive, as she was the commander.</p><p>Chun kicked a broken spatial wave radar in frustration. "We should not end like this! We were supposed to be so much more!"</p><p>Raluca winced; "Chun, I know your upset, but getting frustrated isn't going to help."</p><br><p>D19C8 – Three minutes until cycle change.</p><br><p>"<img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">" came another message from Eleesha.</p><p>There was no time left, they both knew it, Chun raised her knife, watching the only non-broken door to the reactor room, knowing in just seconds the remaining Mush would be upon them, she dropped her iTrackie and picked up her blaster.</p><br><p>D20C1 – Three hours until cycle change.</p><br><p>There was a horrid smashing noise as the hunters that had chased the ship made another bombing pass.</p><p>Ship hull integrity at 1%. The electric voice of NERON sounded off.</p><p>Chun felt a glimmer of hope.</p><p>The door flew off it's tracks as the Berzerker that was once Janice Kent charged into the room, barreling straight towards Raluca. Raluca, to her credit typed the last line of code before it was halfway across the room.</p><p>The next seconds were a blur. The mush that was Janice slammed Raluca against the wall of the ship. "Death Registered: Raluca... Mother? No! don't leave me alone!" NERON's distraut voice rang out through the ships PA system, Chun winced, Raluca had been a friend.</p><p>This was when Eleehsa walked into the room, toting a blaster and wielding a sadistic grin that went from ear to gash caused by an earlier skirmish between Chun and her.</p><p>Janice turned to Chun and gave what could be described as a smile, if she had anything resembling a face left.</p><p>The first shot rang out as Chun began to charge at her, it went wide, hitting a rear wall.<br>The second shot bounced off of Chun's Plastenite Armour.<br>The third shot was cut short by Eleesha's head being lopped off.</p><br><p>"Death Registered: Eleesha Williams. Cause: Decapitiation."</p><br><p>Chun spun on the spot, covered in blood, she charged at Janice.</p><p>Janice was not smiling.</p><p>A single missed punch was all Janice could muster, before three stabs ran a staccato down what could have been a spine.</p><br><p>"Death Registered: Janice Kent. Cause: Stabbed."</p><br><p>Chun dropped to her knees in the gore.<br>She looked to the ceiling, tears running down her cheeks, and began laughing.</p><p>Chun knelt dazed for what seemed like hours, when the announcement snapped her out of it.</p><br><p>D20C1 – 1 hour remaining.</p><br><p>"Time... to... finish this, I guess." Now on her feet, she walked past the headless body of Eleesha and into the Icarus Bay, the ship of course, was gone. Lost five days ago along with four of the crew when Lai Kuan-Ti had pulled a coup.</p><p>Then into the rear corridor; Here she had killed Kuan-Ti and scarred Eleesha, allowing Raluca to escape into the engine room not even a day ago.</p><p>The Bravo Bay, only one ship was left, the other two had been lost when the Icarus was abandoned, along with Roland Zuccali and a Pilot Drone.</p><p>Then the Central Corridor; Stephen's body still sat here, sitting atop the bodies of the Mushy Gioele and the Berzerker form of Ian. The crazy bastard was still smiling, even in death.</p><p>The front corridor showed the signs of the fight that ended in the Central Corridor, a dented wall from an unluckily thrown Ian, bloodstains from where Gioele and been punched straight into here by Stephen's insanely strong fists.</p><p>The lab still had the cryo-damaged bodies of the science officer and the security officer, and judging from the heat coming from the Hydroponics lab, a fire still burned in there. Chun grabbed the hacker-kit from the lab.</p><p>Lastly was the Bridge, Paola and Freida's bodies were mangled here, struck down by Kuan-Ti when he started his coup.</p><p>Chun began hacking in.</p><p>She tried again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>Again.</p><p>"No."</p><p>Again.</p><p>She ate a ration.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Again.</p><p>"God no!" She screamed as she through her knife against a wall.</p><p>She curled up, she'd failed.</p><br><p>D20C1 – Three minutes remaining.</p><br><p>Chun wandered over to the comms station, and sat looking through the log of messages.</p><p>Her friends obituaries.</p><br><p>One Minute remaining.</p><br><p>She slumped her head.</p><p>Chun's head shot up. There was a notification she missed.</p><p>"Save humanity." From Commander Raluca.</p><p>Thirty seconds.</p><p>She tried again.</p><p>It worked.</p><p>Fifteen seconds.</p><p>She pressed the big red button.</p><p>Five seconds.</p><p>The circle swirled.</p><p>One second.</p><br><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><br><p>The orbit of Sol sure looked pretty.</p>

The immense amount of code required to make the PILGRED reactor work would surely accrue some bugs. And the situation in which she was placed surely added further leniancy.</p><p>A combination of bad luck and bad timing caused the PILGRED reactor to "fail."</p><p>Chun was thrown back against the rear wall of the bridge, the PILGRED reactor was supposed to be instantaeneous, but she was stuck in the Hyper-space void which it used to travel.</p><p>She felt a rib break under the extreme pressure, but she couldn't open her mouth to voice a complaint. She lost conciousness then.</p><p>Her last thoughts were of Sol, she remembered the last time she'd seen it, the day she'd left for Xyloph-13.</p><p>"The orbit of Sol sure looked pretty."</p><br><p>--<br><br>Three figures stood in the Icarus bay of Daedalus, an Icarus class vessel had just brought them in.<br>The Daedalus had been torn asunder, with most rooms being ripped clean form the ship.<br><br>"Captain" the slimmest of the spacesuit wearing intruders spoke; "This can't be real can it?"<br><br>A rotund figure in a spacesuit spoke next; "Quiet! This could be a Mush trap... AND DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING!" Ignoring his own advice he yelled at the third spacesuit-clad figure who jumped. They'd been about to collect a blaster from the floor.<br><br>"Y-yessir! Sorry sir!" Came the reply.<br><br>"Well, we'll accomplish nothing by just standing around in here, Central Corridor was supposedly intact right?"<br><br>The boarding party walked through the door into the long corridor.<br><br>"Oh my god! I'm smelling this through the damned suit!" Shouted the slim member.<br><br>The Captain would have reprimanded him, had the smell not forced him to keep his mouth shut.<br><br>The body of a technician who was now thoroughly unrecognizable due to decay, lay next astrew in the corridor.<br>"He was Mush, Captain." The third member of the party said as they sat in a squat over it. "Look, he still has spores stuck to him. I'd say cause of death was the multiple stab wounds." They grimaced "not uh, not that the Mush would bury one of their own, but do you think they'd just leave them lying in the open like this?"<br><br>The Captain shook his head, "who knows with those monsters, anyway, the Nexus should have the ships logs."<br><br>The door fell off it's tracks as the group walked inside, a single light blipped from the console in the center of the room.<br><br>D37C3 – Two hours and fifteen minutes until cycle change. The quiet voice of NERON rang out.<br><br>"Did it just say D37? Jesus!" The slim crewman spat out.<br><br>The Captain, for all his skills, was unable to give a look of disdain at the loudmouth due to the spacesuit.<br><br>"Let's just check the logs." Sighed the Captain.<br><br>The trio spent an hour trying to recover the logs, but could only access up to two days ago.<br><br>"Captain, I've got partial message logs." Said the the third member of the party.<br>"Looks like this ship has been adrift since... D20C2?"<br>"The last message is a commander title reassignment message for... Zhong Chun?"<br><br>"Chun... Wait, how could it be Chun?" The loudmouth said.<br>"I'm just reading what it says here." They shot back.<br><br>Interrupting the two before they could bicker further, the Captain took charge: "Alright you two layabouts, it seems this ship is deserted, and as interesting as it is, we gain nothing from learning about it."<br><br>"The shower is still intact sir, would you like me to remove it? We could always use more shower components." The third crewmate said, suddenly producing a wrench.<br><br>"Good idea, you go do that, I'm gonna head up to the Lab and see what research these guys got finished before whatever happened here, happened."<br><br>"Uh, Captain?" The loudmouth said.<br><br>Rolling his eyes, he turned to the slim figure. "What?"<br><br>"I've just accessed the life sign detector..."<br><br>"And?"<br><br>"It's reading four <em>living</em> humans."<br><br><span class="tid_wspoil">So... I'm gonna continue writing until someone tells me to stop, I've always wanted to see Chun become Commander, because let's face it, Chun is awesome.<br><br>If you guys have any questions, I'll answer them.</span></p>

                <p>Chun sat in the bridge, she'd tried – And failed, to launch the Pilgred reactor. She was out of food, low on health and energy, and had given up hope entirely.</p><p>When she'd dropped out of Hyper-Space, the Daedalus had torn itself asunder, parts had flown off drifting at speeds incomprehendable. NERON had locked down the doors in the bridge to prevent what little oxygen was left from escaping, Chun only had access to the bridge and the Forward Bravo Turret.</p><p>She was lucky that a spacesuit just so happened to be sitting in gunner seat, and she was twice as lucky that she could use the turret as an impromptu airlock.</p><p>With a little luck she'd managed to grab food and the medkit from Refectory and Laboratory respectively.</p><p>So, everyday she had ventured as far as she could into the ship to try and find more supplies, but she'd grabbed all she could.</p><p>Chun knew it was over, she was alone in the middle of space, but she'd tried, she'd fought tooth and nail for life.</p><p>Chun closed her eyes.</p><br><br><p>"Yo Cap! Found her." The loudmouth shouted down the corridor.<br>He crouched on the balls of his feet as he looked her over, "Damn Cap, she'll starve to death if we don't get her something to eat this cycle."</p><p>The Captain crouched next to her, he raised a bar of something to her lips, and began forcefeeding her.</p><p>"Woah a Supervitamin bar? Those things are expensive, are you sure Cap?"</p><p>"I swear to God, if you do not shut up we are leaving you on this ship."</p><br><br><p>ERROR: (DayCycleCalculation) localizing...<br>Medlab, D5C4 – Two hours until cycle change.</p><p>Chun's eyes opened slowly, the lights in the Medlab blinded her at first, but her eyes adjusted quickly, in the corner of the room was a rotund sillohette.</p><p>"So, you are awake then." The voice of the Commander of the Daedalus rang out.<br>"KIM!" Chun shouted and immediately regreted it, as she coughed blood.</p><p>"Easy there, we've got a few questions for you before you die on us again."</p><p>ERROR: (CrewListCalculation) [INTEGERTOOHIGH!] 11+1 Alive, of which one is Mush, 5 defunct, of which one was Mush.</p><p>"Day two, cycle seven; the Mush formerly known as Wang Chao rampaged in the laboratory, taking down two Laboratory Staff; Finola Keegan and <em>Zhong Chun</em>. He then took down ship owner Gioele Rinaldo and severly wounded shipboard chef Stephen Seagull. Before finally being killed himself by Roland Zuccali via Blaster." He let the statement hang in the air for a few seconds.</p><p>"Chun, how are you alive?" The Commander asked.</p><p>Chun blinked. "Commander... That never happened."</p><p>The Commander gave her a blank look. "Well then, as it seems my memory has become faulty, why not tell me what happened?" It was more a command than a question.</p><p>"Well, Chun and Finola never woke up, they had cryo-damage."</p><p>The commander nodded.</p><p>"Gioele was converted to the Mush by Terrence, who later would take control of Eleesha's body, and Stephen died after taking down two Mush who were trying to destroy the ship after-" Chun cut herself short.</p><p>"After what Chun?" The Commander asked.</p><p>"After you were abandoned on a planet of Mankarogs and heavy siesmic activity with Jiang Hua."</p><p>"So, with your story Stephen definately died?"</p><p>"Yessir."</p><p>"Ste- 'Captain' would you please come in here?" Commander Jin-Su spoke into his communicator.</p><p>A few moments later, a tall mustachioed man entered the room. "Sir, yes sir! Captain Stephen Seagull reporting as requested!" He stood at full attention, he didn't move an inch until the commander motioned for him to relax.</p><p>Chun was pale, she'd seen Stephen after the Mush attack, he was very much dead. With the Commander, maybe it was possible that the Icarus they had on that planet had found the Daedalus after it dropped out of Hyper-Space, but the dead don't just come back.</p><p>Feeling faint, Chun laid back into the bed.</p><p>"Commander, sir! Sorry for speaking out of order sir! But have we considered the possibility that this is a Mush trap sir?"</p><p>"Captain, Chun is immune to the infection of the Mush, and a bio-scan by Janice already-"</p><p>"JANICE!" Chun shouted, interrupting the Commander.</p><p>"What, Chun?" The Commander asked.</p><p>"Sh-she is an Alpha Mush!"</p><p>Kim Jin-Su pinched the bridge of his nose. "Chun, Janice came down with Gastroentroeitis not five hours ago. And as we both know, Mush don't get sick." He turned a pair of angry eyes to her, then to Stephen, "Now, if I can finish what I was saying; Janice confirmed that she has biology matching the Ghost Chun Codex we retrieved from the Xyloph database."</p><p>The Commander stood up, "We detected something different about the PILGRED Reactor on that ship Stephen, take Terrence and Raluca, gather as much info as you can if you aren't able to outright bring it back, and make it fast, we are leaving on cycle six."</p><p>Captain Seagull saluted and marched out of the room.</p><p>"Chun, get some rest, we will figure this out after you've recovered."</p>

                <p>D5C5 – Three hours until cycle change.</p><br><p>Raluca had a hand to her head as she sat in the Icarus, she'd just had a sofa installed in her room aboard the Daedalus, she was not pleased to be awoken from the only sleep she'd had since she'd come out of Cryofreeze.</p><p>"Stephen, let me make something very clear to you." Raluca seethed.<br>"If this turns out to be nothing- which it probably will... Well, they don't make Plastenite armour thick enough to stop what I'll do to you."</p><p>Stephen, or Captain as he preffered to be called, sat directly across from her. "Thinly veiled threats are a good way to get yourself on the Mush watchlist Ms. Tomescu." Stephen glared directly at her. "And where is your uniform? I don't know what the hell that is you are wearing, but it isn't in the uniform policy I assure you."</p><p>Raluca wore a long gothic-style dress, she'd discarded her uniform the second she'd stepped foot into the engine room. "Tasteful. Much more than I can say about that hideous thing you wear."</p><p>"Guys, don't make me turn this thing around." Terrence called to the passenger section.</p><p>Stephen gave a harrumph, and silently glared at Raluca for the rest of the trip.</p><br><p>D5C5 – Two hours thirty minutes until cycle change.</p><br><p>Terrence flew the Icarus into the destroyed ship's Icarus Bay, easily maneuvering it as if he'd done it a thousand times.</p><p>"Alright, there isn't any Oxygen in this thing, so spacesuits on. Also, if one of you could give me a push out there, that'd be great." Terrence discharged his wheelchair and sat on it.</p><p>Stephen climbed down and grabbed the wheelchair, followed shortly by the agitated Raluca.<br>"Thanks Cap." Terrence piped.</p><p>"Now listen, my drones picked up... some pretty gruesome things in there, most of it's been cleaned but... the smell is still there."</p><p>Even the environmental filter on the spacesuit wasn't enough to drown out the smell of decaying bodies, Raluca nearly heaved upon the door sliding open.</p><p>"Alright, power through it team, we need to extract as much info on this thing as we can." Stephen began heading to the centre of the room when his foot hit something.</p><p>"This looks like... oh god!" The sound of vomiting overcame the inbuilt communicators of the spacesuits.</p><p>"Let's... Let's do this quickly."</p><p>It took some time, but Raluca was able to access the PILGRED system and find out exactly what went wrong, Terrence had begun dissassembling the reactor, in hopes that they could bring it over with them. Stephen had been hefting the parts Terrence dismantled back to the Icarus.</p><br><p>D5C5 – One hour until cycle change.</p><br><p>Chun was awake in the Lab going over the research the crew had been doing, looking though the logs of the Mush-Hunters and examining the remains of the one Mush they had killed.</p><p>Chun let out a sigh of frustration, she'd been looking for something, anything, that would give this away as an elaborate trap set by the Mush, but so far, everything looked... Normal, too normal, all things considered.</p><p>Commander Jin Su chose now to enter. "Chun, it's good to see you up, but I thought I told you to get some sleep?" The Commander held folded clothes in his arms.</p><p>Chun eyed the bundle suspiciously, "Oh right, your old clothes were so badly covered in blood and Mush spore that we burned them, these were the clothes of our- of you. Before you uh-"</p><p>Tactful, Chun thought. "Thank you Commander, anything is better then this bedsheet."</p><p>Chun took the bundle and got changed in the Medlab, it was a pair of brown cargo pants and a white longsleeve shirt, her armour fit snugly over the top of it. She also noted; there was a knife holster on the belt of the pants.</p><p>She walked back to the lab to speak with the Commander.</p><p>"Kim, we need to talk, something is seriously wrong with this situation and I think-" Whatever Chun's thought was, it was interrupted by an urgent interruption from NERON:</p><p><strong>Death registered: Terrence, cause:</strong> <strong><em>&lt;&lt;Assassinated&gt;&gt;</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
