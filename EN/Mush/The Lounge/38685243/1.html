                <p>Bunch of gnus, Derek here!</p><p>You are nothing but woohoo bananas, but that was a really nice game which ended great despite the odds. At D9,cycle 6, with no plasma shield and a hull with only one point left our voyage was over after a lot of fun, dangers and great actions.<br>Here is the link of the end page: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4151" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4151</a></p><br><p>We started a promising ship, but really quickly the mushes Eleesha and Frieda went for a rampage, so Janice was killed and Raluca as well-I heard Raluca wanted to kill Eleesha but before she was able to hit her Frieda got her.<br>Hm, I still don't know why the mushes decided to do just that action since we had also 2 motivators and 2 technicians, so we were not really doomed after that.</p><p>But not long after this incident we did an expedition which really hurted us strongly.<br>We had found a planet with 2* intelligent life, caverns and some bad zones, but not too bad with our polyvalent andie. So Roland and myself waited for Andie to start the expedition.<br>Since Andie didn't show up for some time, Roland said that someone else shoudl just replace Andie (what terrence did) and that was the worst decision ever.<br>The RNG was really bad to us and damaged us hardly. also noone or almost noone had weapons since we thought Andie would participate ... also terrence had only 10 hp at the beginning of the expedition. After 7 zones of expedition i was online (was surprised that we started the expedition without andie) and saw that Terrence's health was already only at 4 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">. And then we had a forest and... I GOT LOST. damn it.</p><p>And after the forest Roland and Terrence faced an intelligent life zone with a fight event and without my help now, OMG. Terrence was killed by the alien and Roland was down to 4<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">. <br>The last zone was an insect zone-with an accident, where a giant centipede fell on Roland and killed him..Oh no, this can't be true I thought &gt;.&lt; ...</p><p>so there I was, lost on a planet and the icarus was lost here as well... I almost lost hope since i also had only 4 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">, was starving after staying lost a cycle on the planet, and had almost no morale left. Btw, from witnessing teh deaths of Roland and Terrence I got some illnesses-for example the coprolalia.<br>Oh, I was so lucky that when I had only 1 morale left Jin Su came to the planet with a patrol craft and he saved me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Yeah, after that expedition surviving was really interesting.<br>Two times we were low on oxygen, but Andie and Gioele did successfull expeditions with patrollers.<br>We had only one pilot left (Jin su), but at least we had gotten an invertebrate shell in our unfortunate expedition. So I was able to help well with shooting of arracks and we mostly had to flee from hunter waves.</p><p>In the end we were able to finish lots of research, but when we had to mve away from a hunter wave, Jin was asking first whether it is ok to move and then forgot about it. So after cycle change we had only one hull left xD.<br>At that point we finally returned to sol with serum.<br>Thanks for the great game, we were a good team!</p><br><p>And here is the link of the unfortunate expedition:<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/6298" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/6298</a></p><p>Ps: I was still a virgin at the end of the voyage <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>As you noticed in the quickest death thread: I was that dead Raluca.</p><p>I had an almost full AP bar when Eleesha decided to be a boring little berserker. So I went to Bravo Bay just waiting for cycle change to 'trade' my Cat for Chuns Knife and vent some antisocialness on the mush. <br>Cycle Change came. I refreshed the page it showed the normal room for a second. Reloading immediately to tell me: <em>You are dead!</em></p><p>So while my awful slow browser loaded the page Frieda had entered, mutated and killed me. And all that without me even seeing her. Fun.
