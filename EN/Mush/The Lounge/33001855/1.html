                <p>Yeah, it's Terrence. I decided to play the most aggravating I could possibly play (aided coincidentally by some sleep deprivation) without being assassinated. Win! XD I really wanted to roleplay more, as Terrence is a total misanthrope who loves his robots more than people.</p><p>We were so close to having a productive working ship, but players kept leaving when things got good. By the way I hope I didn't offend anyone whose first language wasn't English ... you speak much much better English than I could ever speak any 2nd language; I was just explaining that it takes longer to make sure communication goes through, in case other people were already on your case trying to kill you or something. And there was so much killing of humans <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/eek.png" alt=":tid_eek:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I want to apologize to Raluca, I hope I didn't lead you astray. I just wasn't sure because you hadn't announced your killing Jin Su, and then they went for you instead of Hua (the real mush). Other than that, it was fun ^^;;;;;</p><p>That we pulled off an expedition was pretty sweet. Until Ian posted publicly where the meat was, and none of us had MP to receive it. Of course it disappeared. Eleesha and Finola also disclosed that Eleesha was one spore away from being Mush, so of course.... Honestly, people's private comms being blocked and people leaving in mid-turn was probably what doomed us more than the newb mistakes. I made my share of the latter <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"> Yes, Freida and I really did try to look for her walkie-talkie, which was a hilariously bad mistake. The fact that she'd checked a room that none of the inventory takers had checked was also a big red herring. What I should have known was the little detail of whether I'd told Hua about looking for the walkie talkie at all. But with closed private convos, there was no way for me to check (nor any time, because I had to convince people to act). So yeah, I was got, and good.</p><p>The mush assassination attempt also had very obvious timing: as soon as Finola reported the mycoscan nearly finished.</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">So here's what really happened to me... </span></span></p><p>For all I warned you guys not to get stampeded (happened anyway), ironically I saved my own skin by moving fast. What happened before I was on the Bridge with the Hacking Unit <span class="tid_wspoil"><strong>is that Roland was supposed to load the fuel. He disappeared. I browbeat (XD) Ian into loading it, only to find that our commander, Freida, was in the dorm and not the Bridge. If Ian or Roland had arrived even 5 minutes earlier, or if Freida had just stayed on the Bridge till cycle change, it would've all worked. <br><br>So that meant I had to make it to the Bridge. The thing is, the Hacking Unit just. Would. Not work. And then when it finally did... it needed 1 more AP. As Terrence I could use creepy statue Kuan Ti to get to the labs for a pill, and also a mycoscan. <br><br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/demoralized2.png" alt=":mush_pills:" class="tid_ico"> I got 1 AP from the bacta... but it also got me dirty. Yes, all the consumables can do that. So I returned to the Bridge to find that I had to start the hack ALL OVER AGAIN. I nearly cried. I could've asked for a ration, but I didn't know who to trust at that point (also we were low on rations). I realized no one else had enough AP to hack it either, and they needed it to kill Hua. So yeah, I decided to take a chance that the Mush were a greater danger than the Hunters. <br><br>Then Hua was inexplicably not killed, and I decided there was nothing for it but to make the refectory run myself; no AP, no go. Remember: I had no idea if Ian was the second Mush either. He was getting so many humans killed, and willfully ignored that Hua was the proven Mush, he should've been Iago <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> That is why I never dropped the Hacking Kit. </strong> </span></p><p>I thought for sure, by the way, that I'd get whacked for not giving the Hacking Kit to Chun. It wasn't actually a judgment call about her capabilities. It was that she was so inactive that the Mush would have no trouble knocking her off, then it would really be game over. I couldn't put both eggs in one basket.</p><p>The weird thing was, I decided not to eat in the Refectory. The AP gain, since I had to cook it myself, just didn't add up to a full try at the Hacking Kit.</p><p>Height of ironies, after begging all game for people to stand in the corridor, Ian and Kuan Ti were <em>standing in the corridor</em>! The labs were also full. So with no MP, I went to the labs. I made the terrible mistake of putting the Hacking Kit down, which was logged, but changed my mind and dropped the walkie-talkie to pick up the medkit and the hacking kit with my map. Finola had left the bed, and so I bedded down to recover AP.</p><p>A half hour before cycle change, Hua walked into the medlab.</p><p>I knew – the whole ship knew – that I had 0 spores to begin with. So this had to be a murder attempt. Hua also took the other bacta. So he was out of AP... no killing yet. I got up, was not murdered, so before he could, I just went right back to bed.</p><p>Exactly when the cycle changed, I let Hua push me out of the room. BOOM.</p><p>Chun was in the turret, and I thought about trying to get to Bravo Dorm, or maybe even circling to mosey to Alpha Dorm and its shower. Fortunately I didn't move, because Mush!Eleesha popped into the room. I could only go back into the room with Hua, and went right past him, thanks for the push out the door, Hua! LOL. I hung out in Center Corridor with Ian, and then Chun woke up and moved into Bravo Bay, and like magic.... I was in Bravo Dorm. And the Mush were nowhere near the Hacking Unit.</p><p>I did my best trying to save the rest of the ship <span class="tid_wspoil"> <strong>but there were no updates about the Mush, or any other crew. The more ground I covered, the less the Mush would be able to find the Hacking Unit. Of course, I thought my human crewmates might realize I don't even have a walkie talkie, or even post-its, and personally ask me where I put it. But the ship was about to blow up, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_eng.png" alt=":mush_eng:" class="tid_ico"> so I did reinforce the hull with my last AP, and then <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"> put out the engine fire, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fuel.png" alt=":mush_fuel:" class="tid_ico"> put fuel in the chamber, and then watched as someone checked another fire .... in the room with the scrap metal. Which could've repaired the hull. So the Hunters blew us up anyway. </strong> </span></p>

                <p>Freida here . This is my fourth ship. And just first there were sufficiently active people. In the end of the day I was horrified to see that I am the alpha Mush . I did not know what to do, I was terrified the first two days . By mistake I took the skill right away - fungal kitchen ( which I never used <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">). I was afraid to even sneeze at the wrong time and because of this did stupid mistakes . Terrence, when I lost my walkie-talkie I went to infect Eleesha . I searched all the stores in search of suitable things for the expedition that I had not suspected , and is already on the way to the bridge I realized that I forgot the wakie-talkie (I found it in the evening in the storage that you check. It seems that other players can not see other people's radios). Then it turned out well . The next situation that made me worry about it when we killed Stephen. Ian wanted to give me food that I had killed him , but I could not risk getting dirty because the shower would have killed me , and as it would be clear that the food did not give me the AP . I refused to eat referring to the fact that I do not believe him and the food can be infected. Then there was a slight lull before the storm. Hua tired of playing hide and took up a lot of time. She decided to do the most damage and die. Next was pure improvisation as we tried to gain time forcing you to kill Raluca . I did not want to be alone , and we have developed a plan. The preparation was exhilarating . We are counting down the last minutes before the start of the cycle. I think my "tick tock" in the general chat has revealed me ahead of time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>Hua mood at the moment - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=i+so+excited&amp;sm=1" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/results?search...</a><br>Mine is - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAYhNHhxN0A" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAYhNH...</a><br>Well, after Hua finished sleeping Eleesha directly under the camera and went to kill you . I did not want to finish ship quickly and led him away from the hunters that would Hua able to deal with you . I do not know what happened after that , I was killed .<br>I do not know how events would develop if we are not quick to take our skills. We could end Eleesha during the expedition and take anonymush. It is also the original goal was Jin Su. It is a pity that he has finished .You and Eleesha brought us a lot of problems and we wanted to recruit you.</p><p><cite>I was just explaining that it takes longer to make sure communication goes through, in case other people were already on your case trying to kill you or something</cite></p><p>Yes, I remember Ian shouted in radio when we killed Stephen ""Frieda, Frieda! Do not be silent, do not be suspicious" I'm frantically searching for a good cause that would abandon his plan</p><p>I didn't receive long ago so many emotions from games.<br><span class="tid_wspoil">I hope you will be able to read this wall of text that I wrote with the help of an translator.</span></p>
