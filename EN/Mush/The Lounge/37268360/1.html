(See how many light blue icons are there as opposed to project? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>Well..what can I say. Silence. Dead silence. As I walked trough the corridors, I saw a Chun staring at the walls, Kuan Ti staring outside in a turret... not a single trace of life.<br>THEN THEY MOVED! Silently standing in another room, logs showed that they did something...but never saying a word. I'm looking at you Chun, advancing research at the randomest of times, not showing signs of life, except when you TOOK MY APRON! I GOT DIRTY,<strong></strong><em> DIRTYYYYY</em><strong></strong> BECAUSE OF THAT! *Internal screaming*</p><p>As went back to Sol, only thing I see as I write the end screen is..<br>"Chun has dropped the Stainproof Apron. 56min <strong><em>HNNNNNNNRGGHHHH</em></strong>"</p><p>2 mushes were inactive, as the screens says "Spores generated: 1", and that went to Raluca only. <br>RNG happened as our only disaster, fires hurting as room damages started to be frequent for 2 damage. Hunters were good, oxygen was good, we had 3 expos, which was our main problem. Sadly the inactive ones hurt this part of the ship, so Eden was statistically impossible at that rate (although some people wanted to try), hence we returned to Sol.</p><p>Not much happened in my opinion, but it was a nice, calm ship.</p><br><br><p>Anyway! I have to praise Jin Su for being an active commander, which is suprisingly few and far between. Most people who communicated did their jobs well, so kudos for that!<br>Raluca and mush Kuan Ti (right?) were new people with their first ships. Congrats for Raluca as she'll be a good mush player if she keeps this up, quickly getting the hang of the basics. Hell, she did better than the last Raluca player I had. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Any run that ends after day 10 is a good Mush run!</p><p>I was Jin Su on our voyage. It started off so well for us, by which I mean one Mush was inactive and the other made a suicide attack that failed. At about day 6 we had two dead Mush and no dead humans while being pretty certain there were no Mush left (which did end up being the case)! What more can you ask for, right?</p><p>Well, one human died of depression shortly after, inactive. And many of our other humans were barely active and non-communicative. A few stalwarts kept things moving but as the pressures mounted we couldn't keep up. Getting some pretty bad luck in our expeditions sure didn't help. We also had really poor ration discipline and were out of rations pretty early.</p><p>My biggest props go to Raluca who was always trying to help, Finola who was a researching MACHINE, Terrance who had swarms of drones flying around the ship, Janice who did lots of hugging to keep spirits up, and Roland who performed his hunter-killing duty like a champ. You guys were great and I'd be proud to fly with you again.</p><p>My biggest frustration was Hua who rarely communicated and, while she did get out there and shoot down hunters, liked to STAY out in her patrol ship for cycle after cycle. If she could have at least told us when she planned to come back in it would have been bearable. But after slowing us down more than once, she finally parked outside with two asteroids hurtling towards us. I had no choice but to abandon her to preserve the ship. I firmly believe we could have probably managed at least one more expedition if we hadn't had to wait on her all those times. She also gave me a new respect for the Magnetic Nets project! How I wish we'd completed that one!</p><p>Anyway, it was a great run. Nicely done, crew!</p>
