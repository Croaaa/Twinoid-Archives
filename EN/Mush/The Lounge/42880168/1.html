Derek and Gioele starved early as new players than never completed the tutorial. Roland flew his patrol ship out but never returned to the ship. Stephen and Hua went inactive. Jin Su for some reason never selected a skill and Raluca spent a lot of AP using turrets instead of advancing NERON.</p><p>Eleesha got sick seeing someone die early and confirmed herself human. I had already been sweet talking Chun, but decided on day 4 to eat a couple of bananas (all the pots were full) as I was the Shrink but there were no other ready sources of morale on board. This of course won over Chun's trust.</p><p>Around the same time Raluca took us to a planet with Volcanoes by hacking the command console, abandoning (inactive human) Roland. She was my primary suspect as Mush, along with the skill-less Jin Su, but I had no real idea who the Mush were.</p><p>And then everything changed. The cycle after I had food tested, KT used defacer in Alpha Dorm. He and Ian spiked me once each. Apparently I had picked up a spore from Trapper earlier in the journey. I was now Mush. (Ian took anonymush)</p><p>I immediately told my new friends where the Mycoalarms (that I had finished researching) and weapons had been hidden. I continued schmoozing Chun and Eleesha (I was proven human after all). With a great dose of luck, Eleesha didn't wake up in Alpha dorm for several cycles and didn't notice that Defacer had been used there! This bought an injured and dirty KT time to build up AP again. Ian managed to avoid suspicion all together.</p><p>I took the skills Fertile and Mycelium Spirit (the ship had already completed Antispore gas and Constipaspore Serum) and spored later in the day, stealth showering to avoid being seen dirty.</p><p>We were running low on O2 at this point, but Raluca had already taken us to that Volcano and (fortunately) Oxygen rich planet. No one really wanted to go and Jin Su was not online. Eleesha decided to guard the front corridor to prevent hacking of the command console. KT and I made our move. I took my (newly acquired and untested) Infector skill and Defacer. While the planetary exploration was underway we cleared the logs in the front corridor and turned Eleesha to the Mush cause.</p><p>She was online and immediately took anonymush. But my actions raised the suspicion of Chun enough that she said she wouldn't trust me until I food tested again. Jin Su appeared online about this time and immediately killed KT in the refectory, which cheered the crew thinking they had one or maybe two Mush left to deal with (not the three active Mush plotting in whispers). Raluca and Jin Su had both caught illnesses somewhere along the way and proved themselves human. I made sure I stayed near Ian to avoid an alert Chun and made excuses as to why I didn't have AP to comfort Raluca.</p><p>Day 6 dawned and it was going to be a very busy at work (RL) so I took myself to the lab and used infector to turn Andie to Mush (he had also picked up a spore earlier from KT trapping). I stopped by the medlab and defaced the logs to direct suspicion on Raluca and logged out in the dorm with Ian thinking I'd be dead before I got back...</p><p>Several cycles later I log back on... Jin Su and Frieda were dead and I was still alive. Raluca had gone on a rampage and killed two humans... then she died from morale loss herself! The ship now consisted of 4 mush, 2 inactive humans, Chun and Terrence.</p><p>Chun had caught me in a lie at that stage, but she still thought Ian was human. Alpha Mush Ian was not human. Together we planned the execution of Chun when she thought she would be able to take me out <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>With Chun out of the way, we decided to fix pilgred and return home. Comms officer Eleesha had found us a tech book which Ian read, and Eleesha then transfered to Terrence (killed the old Terrence in Eleesha's body) to also become a Tech. We were planning on keeping Hua alive, but she starved to death immediately after we had put plans into place. We rushed to heal Stephen and keep him comforted so the NERON would not flush us from the airlock. Stephen (Mush's Only Hope) had been inactive since the start, but logged on every few days to avoid grand inactive.</p><p>Day 7 cycle 5, we completed Pilgred. I was hoping to convert him to Mush before we flew home to Sol, but Andie wasn't around to provide the extra spore. Captain Stephen wasn't taking us anywhere, so I hacked command and flew us home.</p><p>Was great fun with the Mush team, sorry to the humans, but you mostly self destructed! I do feel sorry for Chun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> It wasn't personal, you just refused to accept the goodness of Mush.</p><p>Would be great to hear what was going on from the human perspective.</p><p>Mush love <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> Jancie (Skeksi)</p>

                <p>Dear crew, Ian the mush here.<br><img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/bg.gif" alt=":cool:" class="tid_ico"> Thanks to Janice here, I don't have to say too much. <span class="tid_user tid_user_8095468 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8095468">Skeksi</span> was a quiet schemer all the way, and it was very good Kuan suggested to make her one of ours. Having a high lvl mush (Gold plated as well) on our team who also was eager and able to bring grand plans <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/mastered.png" alt=":mush_mastered:" class="tid_ico"> to fruition was really fun. Kuan was a great teammate; I couldn't have asked for better. <br>Kuan survived forever; must have been because we had no dedicated police ready to pounce on suspicious characters. A lot of times my experiences of mush-hunting teams <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"> is that there is always someone missing/not interested in plotting and investigating. This was to the Mush's advantage.<br>Eleesha and Andie joined as well. It was great to plot together with Eleesha and Janice. They are skilled Mush players (and were eager to involve themselves in mushy activity) On you, guys.<br>As <span class="tid_user tid_user_8095468 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8095468">Skeksi</span> mentioned, there were a lot of inactives. Stephen, Derek, Hua, Roland, and Gioele all didn't help after Day 1. This makes hunting mush a hard job, especially with a crazy brave Raluca, shooting hunters from turrets, hacking the console to get us to a dangerous planet. Loved you for it, Raluca! She did prove herself by volunteering to take the volcano on, and then mush hunting after proving she got sick on the expo. It was a pity for her that her mush-hunting <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> led her to kill "No skill Jin Su" and "Just doing my job, you mind your own business Frieda". We didn't mind too much though. <br>Paola suffered fatal depression, which is a funny misnoma (you don't die of depression; you die from stabbing your heart out) at a <em>bad</em> time for the crew with +5 or 6 moral going down the drain for the team. Seriously, it felt like an easy victory, but it also goes to show that there were a lot of factors to us winning: Inactives, weird Commander, Defacer and other high Mush abilities, suspicious and murderous crew who actually killed other crewmates, an undecided Chun, and so on.</p><p>The funniest part of this adventure was at the end with killing Chun, having Eleesha to use Terrences body, and then keeping XP farmer Stephen alive so that good 'ol <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"> NERON here didn't kill us straight away. Getting the book and a transfer to make a tech Terrence was the best. <br>I must say it's good to have come to Sol without having touched a soul other than to convert. Paranoia can get to anyone, I know that from my life <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/discrete.png" alt=":mush_chut:" class="tid_ico">!</p><p>All the best, and this may be my last Mush encounter. It weighs too much on my mind at work and whenever I'm doing things on the computer. It's like it locks down normal life in a way that demands that one extra browser-refresh. That fear that you've been found. That worry that Mush are murderizing/"mushrooming" your body while you work or sleep in RL. I'm sure you all have experienced that yourself, personally. <br>I personally can't live a normal healthy life and play Mush like I do. Having stepped back into a role after months of a break, I was reminded of the fun and dooom that seeing and acknowleding that pop-up <strong>"You have chosen... &lt;Ian Soulton&gt;. START THE GAME"</strong> means. I don't treat it lightly to come on board the Daedalus, and that's why I'm leaving again while the memories are good. Perhaps I will jump again much later in the future when the urge rises. Beware the friendly mush...</p><p>Start the game? Start the thing that is Mush. Lolzers.</p>

                <p>Your most fabulous and much discussed Kuan-Ti reporting in. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/cool.gif" alt=":anim_cool:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I didn't expect you guys to make it to Sol with so many hunters and only 60 hull left honestly, then again, I also didn't expect our fantastic little scapegoat Raluca to completely faff up later and kill the only humans. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So what everyone has been mentioning but not really detailing is a rather huge failure on part of the human team, and myself honestly. After blowing a massive amount of AP to convert Janice in a dorm with Ian present, I stole the compass and was planning on holding onto the wrench since they couldn't see who took it...except the wrench hurt me as I picked it up. 6 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> left. I then took my stealthy shower, 3 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> left, I had to repair a door to get in, for some reason it occured to me to drop the wrench beforehand in case anyone in the dorm noticed me dirty as an excuse, I did just repair a door after all....It's at that moment Ian mentions that humans would be starving about now, and I go to correct that issue.....forgetting about the fact that cooking can make you dirty too. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It's at that point I did the only thing I could have done, pretend I was gone as aggressively as possible. As If I got disconnected mid-eating or something. Dirty, in the refectory with no camera and 3 health. I thought I was dead for sure and was plotting around it.....Well amazingly, I come back and I'm alive. And people have even noticed that I'm standing in the refectory dirty and hurt....but nobody attacks me (yet). Chun drops a mycoalarm there in plain sight, but we're already over the planet and Eleesha is guarding the FC against hacker kit attempts...Well that just happened to be right in range for me to convert her with Janice. I knew full well, and the team aswell, that any move I make will cause my death.....So why not add one more to the mush team who I know is in the mush-hunt channel? My time was limited anyway with the crap I had gotten myself into. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Honestly, I think the only reason I lived so long was because of how Raluca was behaving, according to Eleesha and Janice, I was third on the list of suspects with Raluca being on top with what she was doing. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Glad to see you guys managed to succeed so well. Can't get anywhere in mush without a bit of risk, those defacings didn't leave too many potential suspects, but the important one didn't get noticed. I was honestly hoping they humans thought I had only infected you once or twice with the defacing, with how they were, you could probably have just ran through the mycoscan and said you had 1 spore and they'd believe you Eleesha. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>
