                <p>Stephen here formerly known as Hua.</p><p>As Hua, I took pilot and botanist straight away. Raluca kindly vacated the medlab bed while I operated on my shoulder, accuracy is important to a pilot. I finished off the remaining starter hunter, and I planted the alien fruit in a pot brought to bravo dorm. Ship was still filling.</p><p>Ship filled while I slept. Raluca had taken down the bravo dorm shower. Terrence spotted the announcement as he was planning to dismantle the alpha shower, phew. <br>I collect scraps and then next cycle, hunters appeared. Roland took some down but I doubted his ap usage what with having shooter points and saying he ate. Might have been to bridge to connect to sol... or relayed research or something but didn't report.. could have explained it. I voice my concerns to Eleesha, and then in another channel to Terrence when he levels up to pilot.</p><p>Raluca asks for Pilgred relay. Roland goes there and relays once for her. In the first hour of cycle 8, I notice one alpha mush has taken anonymush. I wondered if it was a newbie in the lab waking up after full ship. I go to see and find Stephen picked up the apron but hadn't dropped it, around about the same time. Afterwards, I learn that Raluca was converted by Roland having trapped the engine room. <br>In alpha dorm, suddenly the shower is dismantled by Raluca and there is defacer. Raluca is killed but was not mush so transfer happened, perhaps?</p><p>D3, Paola has gone inactive. Eleesha awakes c5 but Kuan Ti has just beaten her to the kitchen sink. I call out Kuan Ti as mush because that is comms ruined for another day. Later, Kuan Ti steps out of a dorm and 1 minute later, mushification occurs. Kuan Ti is killed that day.</p><p>By this time, I said in order to win, we need to find and kill the mushes, finish pilgred and head home. No one seemed particularly interested in this. I don't know what they hoped to achieve. I had started to suspect Eleesha too. She didn't do any investigative work/leave Bravo Dorm after Kuan Ti had washed.</p><p>Later, just before day change, Eleesha took down bravo dorm camera and I logged in just after day change to find I had been converted. I took anonymush straight away. I decide not to deface the room. Maybe no one would come this way.</p><p>D4. A fire had broken out and spread. One fire was put out by Roland. I decided to start a fire in CBS at c3/4 cycle change and grab oxygen. Frieda's planet didn't have o2 on. The fire spreads to bravo bay and I mention under the neron announcement that it was in bravo bay. Terrence wheels through and puts them both out. I was worried Terrence would work it out. 2 other people had been through bravo dorm and should have noticed the camera being removed/installed again, one of them was the formerly inactive comms. <br>Finola asks why no one told her people could wash in the sink. She did so and completed ASG. No Comms for another day. I push suspicion onto her. But no one is willing to do anything about her or the inactive Jin Su who also dropped his talkie/trakie.</p><p>C7/8. We worry about Chao coming back online as he killed Kuan Ti around this time on the previous day. Roland has a blaster, and the grenade from CBS. Goes to Alpha dorm and boom/blast. Chao dead, Terrence dead. Both doors broken. I take tech (I was planning to level up to U-Turn so didn't bother picking a 3rd skill until late), fix rc/ad door for Eleesha to go through. Gioele and Janice also die. I head up to medlab where the inactive Jin Su stands and so does Finola. 90% base chance of hitting Jin Su is great but it still takes a few ap to kill him. He dropped a knife. All but 3ap used so I take mycelium spirit and manage to extract and spike the inactive Stephen in the laboratory under camera. Chun is also inactive there. Stephen's first job with full ap and mp is to kill Finola. One of the slashes I attempted with the knife misses and I end up biting my tongue. However, a few more slashes and Finola dies. I go next door for Chun but run out of ap to finish her off. <br>Stephen takes Chef, and cooks some rations with the microwave and then with cook points. Eleesha as neron admin informs me that Janice had not changed the bios settings. I head to dorm where Ian lies, but then he goes to the other one instead.</p><p>Day change, only 2 deaths. Without access to the main channel, I could guess by their locations, it was Paola and Ian. I head to bridge and slice Frieda twice. I also could not issue a mission as no one would be able to hear what I said with a torn tongue.</p><p>Overnight, Chun dies. Frieda grabbed the blaster I should have picked up but forgot, and attacks me. I lost 11hp and was down to 4hp. In loading the page, I can just see Frieda's request for help. Roland came and finished her off. Just my old body left. Roland started but was unable to kill her. It is now C4 and with my knife, I kill my old self off. Just 3 of us alive now, all mush, and the cat, aboard the Daedalus.</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7257" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7257</a></p>

                <p>Terrence here (incredibly annoyed because I logged in <em>right</em> as Roland threw that grenade. If I'd had a little more time to act I might not have died so early.<br>Hua, I never had any founded suspicions regarding you but I did notice at one point during our ongoing PMs that you started acting slightly...off. Can't really describe it properly. But I did start filtering what I was saying in that chat just in case, trying to test you a little to see if you were trying to manipulate me into killing certain people. You kept your cover well though <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Disappointed that I died so early cause it seems like what went down afterwards was pretty interesting, haha.</p><p>Anyone care to clear up what the hell happened with Raluca?</p>

                <p>I was human up until a couple of minutes into D4, and after Kuan Ti's death. It is difficult when I suspected Roland of being mush, and you had suspicions about Eleesha which drew my attentions to her but I on my conversion, found them both to be mush.</p><p>I actually asked the original Raluca about the anonymush thing - said conversion mix up and both took anonymush - the truth. Although at the time, I didn't think the mush were that "mushy" Eleesha went into Alpha dorm to spike Kuan Ti under Raluca's defacer and Raluca transferred. I didn't know the full story as I wrote most of the ap during the last cycle of the ship.</p><p>I decided against defacer after my conversion. It would look suspicious - definite mushy activity. If I hadn't spoken at the start of the new day, I could perhaps have gotten away with, when I did wake up - oh, defacer has been used and I could perhaps blame it on a d3c8 time - Finola came through the dorm that cycle.</p><p>Paola and Frieda and you also came into Bravo dorm and should have noticed Eleesha playing with the camera. Did any of you discuss this amongst yourselves?</p><p>Also, you put out the fire I started in CBS. It spread to Bravo Bay, and I was actually surprised. I only mentioned the bravo bay one. I also grabbed 2 o2, which I think in hindsight was a little silly. I was hoping the fire would break the tank</p><p>I was annoyed Finola used the D4 kitchen shower. Kuan Ti used the D3 shower and was mush so thought it reasonable to call Finola mushy. The appetite for caution though seemed very high. With ASG complete, we were unable to extract more spores, otherwise we were planning on converting you, Terry. I was worried Chao would klll someone (though if he had killed Eleesha, we would have been OK, because Roland and I took anonymush, and we could have gotten pilgred fixed and returned to Sol). before day change so that is why we decided to go for ending the ship.</p><p>I could have transferred into Jin Su but after his little temper tantrum, I did not know if he had an injury. Some of the starting injuries are inconvenient, so that is why I went for Stephen. When I took over Stephen's body, he was at 4 morale.</p><p>I feel a little sorry for Ian's death though from fatal depression, he was new. He did a good job.</p><p>Perhaps I should have not only grabbed the blaster from front corridor, but also used it on the cat.</p>
