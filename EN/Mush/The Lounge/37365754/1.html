It wasn't inactive players that ruined this ship, it was a series of bad decisions and some bad luck.</p><p>There were five cameras, yet not all five were installed until D3. Why didn't anyone think to install a camera in the Engine Room quickly? Because of that inaction, I was able to trap the Engine Room three times and convert Raluca to Mush.</p><p>Whenever I'm Alpha Mush, I try to go for an infection of Sol. It was great to get Raluca so easily, now I just needed Jin Su or Chao to be next. Therefore, I trapped three rooms with at least one item that would have been useful to go on the expedition. Yet, no one got converted from that. Before someone says, 'Hey, at least the humans avoided another trap,' the only item that was moved to Icarus Bay in the first three days was a spacesuit. No drill for sectors with fuel. No blaster to prepare in case of combat. If the humans were thinking there were spored shelves, they should have at least had Chun move items to the Icarus Bay. Instead, the expo happened with very few items in inventory. So, that plan failed.</p><p>Also, the research done until D4 was Narcotics Distiller. D<em>4</em>! No one took or hid the Mush Sample, so that can't be used as an excuse. Finola died of depression pretty early, but I have never seen a crew take so long to get an anti-mush research done, even on ships where Finola wasn't active.</p><p>Now to talk about the bad luck. Both Hua and I were Mush, so the humans were in some serious trouble already with both Pilots as Mush. Finola died of depression in early D2. I don't know if it was because of panic attacks or Finola got dirty and the player behind her character wasn't aware of Finola being a germaphobe. That was amusing to see the humans quick to judge a Mush used demoralize with no one at least publicly considering Finola died through other means. Also, there were several fires one of which was in the Engine Room. I think that sealed your fate as the fire broke the reactors so the ship couldn't move. As soon as waves of hunters came in, Hua and I could just wait until the hunters destroyed the ship. I just could not believe how long it took you guys to find an extinguisher. If you were using Astropad, you would have easily found one since no one moved or hid the extinguishers since Mush were selected. Even if you didn't use Astropad, Chao copied and pasted the Astropad info to the Inventory Thread, so <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>I don't think the ultimate outcome would have changed in terms of which side would win even if the humans made better decisions, such as prioritising anti-mush research. Even though I was a Mush, I felt so frustrated anyway seeing that despite the fairly small number of truly inactive people, there was very little activity going on.</p><p>Anyways, I'm interested to read how other people saw this ship. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
