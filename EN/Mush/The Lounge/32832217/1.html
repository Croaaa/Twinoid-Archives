                <p>So I was <strong>Raluca</strong><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/raluca_tomescu.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RT:" class="tid_ico">! And that was my very first game. I wasted a lot of AP exploring things, move and taking showers after those fixes I do on our ship.</p><p>Here is what I, Raluca, thought while playing the game (contains no spoilers to what I didn't know at that time):<br><strong>Janice</strong> organized everything, he made a lot of NERON announcement, listing things we found, also <strong>Paola</strong> who suspected everybody who made a bad step or dirty, organizing our days too. On my first days I mostly made some Pilgred repair and NERON project. <strong>Jin Su</strong> tried to be useful as our captain, but making a lot of mistakes, like trying to move the ship while not fuel loaded, but he also assigned a lot of mission, I got 4 from him, which were a big help to do things.</p><p>As <strong>Raluca</strong> I had to avoid crowded rooms like the dormitores, so I barely sleep. <strong>Janice</strong> helped a lot as a <strong>Shrine</strong> she conforted us.</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> was one of our alpha mush, he moved and hided our stuff but he was very careless, <strong>Paola</strong> suspected him. He hide the medkit, when Roland injured on the bridge, and soon he was assassinated by <strong>Chao</strong> and <strong>Frieda</strong>. Later everybody searched for the medkit, finally I found it in <strong>Rear Bravo Turret</strong> with <strong>Terrence</strong>, I feared thet he is a Mush, so I contacted <strong>Paola</strong> who I trust the most, and I said her what was my feelings about <strong>Terrence</strong> and how I fear he will kill me. She calmed me down, said that she doesn't think <strong>Terrence</strong> is a Mush. I wanted to keep in secret where I put the medkit from Mush, but she doesn't find it useful. I've put it to the Rear Corridor, but <strong>Roland</strong> never used it before he died, I don't know why.</p><p>We shooted down some hunters, and (maybe) <strong>Frieda</strong> or <strong>Hua</strong> collected some Scrap Metal, which <strong>Terrence</strong> used to build some useful items like the <strong>Babel Modul</strong>.</p><p>We mostly not discussed the Mush problem, I couldn't seen any conversation about mush on the public conversation, but later I found that they discussed the Mush problem in some secure channel.</p><p>I (Raluca) fixed broken doors and equipment then loaded the fuel needed and finally we arrived to our first planet, we made a good exploration, gathering some alien steak and the Holo TV which helped a lot to maintain our moral, but they cannot obtain oxigen. I stucked with Pilgred repair and decided to explore the ship, I headed to the bridge and hugged my cat on the labor, exploring the items and rooms. I cannot do anything on the bridge, but found a <strong>Chef book</strong> which I read, and learned a new skill <strong>Chef</strong>. So I made some Cooked Ration later (And that was the moment where somebody said: <strong>5 Cooked Ration is too mush!</strong> where our Forum topic name goes.) I also moved the Mush Genome disk to the labor.</p><p>We had some illness spread as wildfire and we cannot do a lot with it, then we lost <strong>Roland</strong> and I think <strong>Ian</strong> barely could work because of his illness.</p><p>Later <strong>Paola</strong> contacted me, and she told me that may our commander is a Mush, as he acting very strangely, makes a lot of mistakes, saying this is only his second ship is one of the Mush disguise. I told her that he is most likely a Mush as he helping a lot, Paola said he trust in my judge.</p><p>I then started my biggest project the <strong>Sofa on the Bridge</strong> project which was really hard, I had to dismantile the shower on <strong>Alpha dorm</strong>, but I was incapable to do. Finally for 5th try I dismantiled it, but I had to move 5 thing to bridge, my <strong>Wrench</strong>, <strong>Scrap metal</strong>, <strong>Thick Tube</strong>, <strong>Swedish Sofa Blueprint</strong>, which is a lot, so I asked for help, but nobody helped.</p><p>I do some Neron and Pilgred while my efficiency downgraded to 0% and I cannot progress any further (50% was the Pilgred repair). We were <strong>low on oxigen</strong>, but we found a planet with plenty of o2, so I loaded 4 fuel to travel. Later I gathered one more fuel, I wanted to drop in the <strong>Engine room's shelves</strong> to be used later to leave orbit when we done with the planet. But I only could <strong>Inject fuel</strong> so I did this thinking it's okay. <strong>I was absolutely wrong</strong></p><p>I needed to repair the <strong>oxigen reservoir</strong> two times, and I seen on the log that only Stephen was there, he is a <strong>Mush</strong>?</p><p>So I decided to build that damn <strong>Sofa</strong> which *Paola* liked a lot, I had to throw my walkie talkie and had to move the items to the bridge, cooked some food and drinking caffe, eating banana to maintain the neccessary AP, finally I build them the Sofa, There was <strong>Jin Su</strong> and <strong>Stephen</strong> in the bridge, I thought everybody is infected at that time in the bridge so I retreated to <strong>Front Bravo Turret</strong> to try the glitched sofa what appeared here but nobody could use it. <strong>Jin Su</strong> made more and more mistake, we have low on air and wanted to make to the next planet with oxigen. I thought he is probably a mush, I could communicate only on the bridge without my walky-talky, so I whispered to some crewmate I found along my way back to the <strong>Engine</strong> room. I found <strong>Chao</strong> on the corridor, he was inactive at that moment, I whispered him that our captain acting like a <strong>Mush</strong> then I went back to the engine room picked up my Walkie-Talkie on my way.</p><p>I cannot progress any further on Pilgred, but I then learned from <strong>Public Conversations</strong> that the exploration gone bad, we arrived to the wrong planet, no O2, we will die about 6 cycles, <em>everybody said bye-bye</em>.</p><p>Then suddenly <strong>Chao</strong> killed <strong>Jin Su</strong>, then he said that he need to talk me. And suddenly he was with me in the <strong>Rear Alpha Storage</strong> and asked questions about why I told him <strong>Jin Su</strong> is a <strong>Mush</strong> and why I loaded <strong>5 fuel while we only needed 4</strong>. Then he opened fire but barely he can hit me, I escaped to the <strong>Rear corridor</strong> and I sleeped here for few cycles. Meanwhile <strong>Chun</strong> also tried to kill me, and injured me.<br><strong>Frieda and Paola</strong> then killed <strong>Chao and Chun</strong>. I felt that they highly trust me, I they not think I'm <strong>mush</strong>. They said that <strong>Chao</strong> must be stopped, but he is not a Mush so why he attacked me?</p><p>Our plants generated some extra oxigen on end of the day so we could survive for some, but we cannot moved the ship anymore, We had constantly attacked by hunters, had 3 broken doors and 3 broken equipment. Janice somehow left alone dunno how, then a bunch of killing occured but we no longer got messages from NERON, somebody must switched off on <strong>NERON BIOS</strong>.</p><p>Finally 6 of us remained, with two of us were <strong>Mush</strong>. We still wanted to help the ship but we were incapable.</p><p>We was no more oxigen left, so I said that I want to die with my cat, and no one follow me. I went to the lab and picked up <strong>Schrödinger</strong> and waited my death. Later Stephen entered and tried to puch several times, I escaped to the <strong>Medlab</strong> where <strong>Ian</strong> lied down on the bed waiting the death, "IAN WAKE UP" I yelled at him, "STHEPEN IS HERE! He tried to kill me, he is a Mush". "We die anyway" he replied and stayed on bed. we waited the end of the cycle, and our death.</p><p>Then the cycle ended, and we remained only four: <strong>Raluca, Ian, Paola and Stephen</strong>, one of us is a <strong>Mush</strong>, I was sure that <strong>Stephen</strong> is the <strong>Mush</strong>. All our private channels losts, I cannot whisper to <strong>Ian</strong>, don't know why, everything seemed glitchy. I shouted on the <strong>public conversation</strong> channel but nobody answered. I wanted to hit <strong>Stephen</strong> but the door was locked (??), also the bed where <strong>Ian</strong> laid, smoked like hell. I could move to the <strong>Turret room</strong> from here, where I tried to shoot one of the Hunters with my last AP. Later I saw in the room log, that <strong>Ian</strong> was here and tried to punch me, on the End Game page I read that he punched <strong>Stephen</strong>, confusing.</p><p>In the next cycle I died finally.</p><p>Here comes what I think actually happened:</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil"><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> was our alpha Mush, just as <strong>Paola</strong>. <strong>Paola</strong> played her role as well, that nobody suspected her for a moment. That was some brilliant role playing I ever seen, she was helpful, she organized our days she made a lot fo thing. Also she questioned every suspect activities we made. I never thought that she is a Mush!!<br><br><strong>Janice</strong> comforted us, boosted our morale, I could sleep only if she sleeped in the next bed. Then I think <strong>Paola</strong> turned <strong>Frieda</strong> and <strong>Hua</strong> to <strong>Mush agent</strong>, then <strong>Frieda</strong> turned <strong>Janice</strong>. Theye were the most active members, and they were all <strong>Mush</strong>! I just can't beleive! I suspected, <strong>Terence, Ian, Chao, Jin Su and Stephen</strong>. We were misleaded all the time, how can it be? That was the biggest surprise when I saw our theEnd page: they were the <strong>Mush</strong> who I trusted the most. Well played, really well played.<br></span></p><p>I only have one regret: that I loaded 5 fuels where we needed only 4 -&gt; arriving to a totally wrong planet.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Raluca out.</em></p>

                <p>Hi!</p><p>I was playing Ian. Something was fishy in the end. Tried to kill Stephen but after that i checked some conversations and i just couldn't understand how could Stephen be a mush. So i though Raluca was using him as a bait. None of them were the last mush. It was Paola.</p><p>I'm sorry for my lack of activity in the last cycles.
