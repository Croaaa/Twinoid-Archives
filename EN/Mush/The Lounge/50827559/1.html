                <p>Former Kuan Ti transferred into Stephen here.</p><p>Semi inactive ship with some players going inactive. First off was Chun who hadn't started the tutorial. Jin Su (leader and pilot) I think took down some of the starter wave but didn't land and didn't log in again. Command passed to Gioele. The first planet had oxygen on, but it took time to get people to go. However, the commander was offline and Kuan Ti guarded the front corridor. <br>Stephen was alpha mush, apprenticed Janice who was semi-braindead but shrink with neron's friend. However, one morning, there was defacer used in the dorm. Frieda was standing there dirty (from fixing o2 tank) but conclusions were drawn. Later, it was discovered Stephen had entered the dorm (guessing from other rooms off rear corridor). He then transferred into Eleesha who had already read the medic magebook. Eleesha mush was killed. <br>2nd alpha mush was Paola, discovered through lack of progress on comms, and from being dirty eating on two days. However, she trapped at least one shelf (discovered later).</p><p>Things were going quite well, we had active pilots. We also had another oxygen planet and we were getting low by this time. The first expedition there's just 3 crew including myself as Kuan Ti. We hit the cristalite zone and I am converted (I am guessing I had a starter spore, plus picked up one from a shelf). I take anonymush but Terrence thought he noticed an additional mush. I forgot ages ago to update astropad and was unsure if I had imagined a lizaro bp in AB2 (ships' details can blur). However, I didn't imagine it so we had a second sofa in the refectory.</p><p>A second expedition was launched a few cycles later to the o2 planet as we didn't hit that zone. I had thought about loading fuel and leaving orbit, or even hitting the sol button but I would have needed the hacker kit and that is pot luck. Oxygen was obtained. However, Gioele was low health and was steel plated after returning, in IB. Title passed to Stephen. I noticed myself being the victim of shake, and also unhealed damage from the 1st expo. I decided it was too risky to self-heal so decided to infect Stephen and transfer. I know we were so close to day 10 ticket but my mission as mush was to infect sol, not get steel plated.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8799">Ship's end page.</a></p>
