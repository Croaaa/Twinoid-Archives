You respected my boundries and we made a great team. If Derek hadn't killed you, I suspect we might have lasted a few more days and we certainly would have gotten the shield up.</p><p>Jin Su: I think you took my roleplaying a little too seriously, but that was okay and you are forgiven. Even when we butted heads (over everything) it was fun to play with you, and having an active commander was nice. I just wish you hadn't given so many missions to our inactive Chun. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Paola: Bronze and Fantastic. You were a strong player from start to finish, and I hope you keep playing and go silver eventually.</p><p>Roland: I think the two of us ended up friends the entire journey! You kept us in perfect health up until the massive hunter wave, and your injuries were the deciding factor (for me) for an early return. I hope to see you again, seriously. Pro job mate!</p><p>Terrance: You were like a whisper the entire ship. I don't think I saw you speak more than a handful of times, but you were always there for resets and backing the rest of us up. Thank you! Next time you become NERON admin remember to set the Bios though, please!</p><p>Derek: It's a real shame you were Mush. You were one of the more fun people to banter with. Your timing was a little off, had you waited a cycle or two more we would have killed Frieda for your slime trap, instead your rampage saved her.</p><p>Frieda: I hope you enjoyed your first ship, I'm sorry for trying to get you killed!</p><p>Ian: Likewise about your first time as Ian. You did quite well! Remember to treat your plants in Cycle 8 next time! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Hua: Keep trying to get on those expos slugger!</p><p><strong>Not-Honorable Mentions</strong><br>Gioele - I'm not really sure what the hell he was doing. He just kind of sat on the bridge all game, eating Paola's logistics.<br>Stephan - A newbie who didn't finish the tutorial, sadness.<br>Eleesha - A griefer/XP farmer and reported. I hope you get sanctioned.<br>Janice - Poor Janice. I don't think she accomplished anything of note.<br>Andie - You were active, I'll give you that. Also annoying. I can't say I was sad to see you die.<br>Chun - I have no clue why she decided to starve herself in RAT. I was utterly terrified she was a Mush Stephan trying to save up AP for the longest time. I go in there with knife in hand and.... "it's chun? Back here? Well damn!"</p><p>Good game, well played. Best of luck to all of you!</p>

                <p>Roland here, this was a pretty good ship with active people, but we did have some difficulties with roleplaying/personality conflicts. I've had a couple ships in a row where Jin Su is a power tripping authoritarian, and while it's funny as a joke once in a while, it's not really great when it's taken to extremes, such as saying that defying your commander means you must be mush. That being said, Jin Su at least took care all of his duties around ship, which is still more than I could say about some commanders.</p><p>I feel pretty terrible about how I reacted to the Frieda situation. Once people started dying and people started asking if Frieda was on a rampage, I shot first and looked at the logs after. It didn't really help that I was already gearing up to maybe take out Frieda just after Paola confronted her about being dirty. We played right into the mush's hands, and I totally agree, if Derek had waited a little longer, we probably would have ganged up on Frieda. Frieda got slimetrapped, didn't report it in the dirty thread (or at all, until confronted), and we thought she was extracting spores in Front Corridor. It was probably the ideal outcome for a mush using slimetrap. I'd be interested to hear from Derek how he decided to slimetrap her. We were probably extra paranoid since we only had three cameras, and decided to put one in research lab instead of the bridge, so if Frieda <em>were</em> a mush, she and whoever her partner was could spike Paola at their leisure. Come to think of it, our actual mush Derek and Andie might have taken advantage of that and maybe spiked either Paola and Frieda.</p><p>Thinking further, Derek could have taken it upon himself to kill Frieda, and I probably still wouldn't have suspected him.</p><p>Raluca, you were a machine, you did everything that needed doing, especially early on in the ship, and I thought that was just awesome.</p><p>I don't feel like I interacted enough with other crew members, and I wish I had. Everyone seemed pretty great and on the ball (those who were active, at least). I'm not normally a Roland player, and I wish I had recognized that last wave of hunters as being too large to handle (though at least we did take it down from something like 25 to 13). We could have kept going, but the Daedalus had been crippled, and we were confident that the mush had been defeated, so I think we did as much as we needed to.</p>

                <p>Derek here. Sadly, my plan got cut short by just 1 cycle. I had my transfer skill ready to go, but I was just 1 room too far to use it! I was looking forward to keeping up the banter from the start, only to get selected as a mush. It probably would have been a great run for me otherwise.</p>
