Already at Day 10 we had 3 starmap fragments.<br>Well, but the main focus should have been Roleplaying. Though it wasn't easy for everyone, it was enjoyable for me.</p><p>That I got Janice was actually really nice for a Roleplaying ship, because therefore I was also able to roleplay <em><strong>NERON</strong></em> and I really enjoyed roleplaying the mean human-hating machine! <br>I think just for that purpose I should play Janice more often <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>My Janice on the other side was a very kind, lovely, human-loving person, a whole different person than Neron and she was fun to roleplay too. <br>Especially since I got a nice partner with Ian with whom I even got a baby ^^</p><p>It was also funny that while being NERON I did argue very much with Ian, blamed him very much and while being Janice I was rather in love with him. Funny situation I must say.</p><p>I was mostly impressed by the roleplay of Raluca, who did the most mysterious and beautiful roleplay I have ever seen. It was that cryptical the whole time (until the mushes changed or rather corrected her personality) that I had the impression we had the oracle of Delphi on board.</p><p>For example one of early things she said (and similar messages followed):</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Raluca</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">The Lady of Raisin's fears will rear its head. The many will rise... Their spawn will seek glory and revenge... The age of blood shall continue. Reconciliation shall bring about strained peace... But the royals shall not raise the white banner. Darkness consumes the land of false promises. This voyage remains meaningful only to the present. The end holds no relevance upon this one's mind. This one shall walk the present and give the everything the attention it deserves. If the many and the royals wish to join the fade only having regret the past... or battle what is futile... Then they shall blind themselves to what is now.<br><em>She steps up to the red eye of Neron's in the Nexus.</em><br>To hate is to regret never having the opportunity to love. When this one looks at the crimson with contempt and yet... It's beauty shines like a dwarf of crimson.<br><em>She licks her finger and spitshines the lense of the eye.</em><br>This one shall not regret having lived the past.</span></span></p><p>But I enjoyed really all (active people) of you, especially the people who did RP of course, but also Eleesha and Jin though they did no or not much RP, but were still nice and helpful people!</p><p>Btw Andie, I knew instantly that you would be ZaphodBeeblbrox <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In the end a big question remains: <br>Did we really reach the promised land or rather the land of the false promises Raluca did warn us about?</p>

First time ever playing Stephen. I swore so much when I logged in and saw that I had rolled pretty much the ONE character I wasn't interested in RP'ing. Well okay, but he's mush. Frieda and I worked out a backstory on how her faction had rescued him when the mush were going to have him executed (in his official bio), and offered relocation or conversion, and he chose the latter. Went from there and ended up with devoted to her and the mission, determined to finally do something that matters with his life. They were going to set up that damn humanity preserve on Eden and it was going to be beautiful and save the best parts of humanity from being squooshed by the main mush collective which viewed them as so many violent animals that needed saving from themselves.</p><p>So he was a model mush - he was going to show the humans that cohabitation was not only possible, but beneficial. Except.... there wasn't really any resistance. I mean, Andie flailed about entertainingly calling us things like zombie alien mind invaders, but Andie was so over the top and difficult to engage in a serious manner, other than getting offended as appropriate. For the most part, humans were like 'Mush!? Oh my... Oh, peace? Well, okay then. Cool.' For a while Frieda and Stephen were convinced that something was being arranged in secret but........ nothing ever happened. Chun, I think, tried, but she was pretty busy. She'd come around and say something to the effect of 'No, you're mush, you're evil!' and we'd respond, but then she didn't come around for another day or two and when she did it wasn't a continuation of the conversation, it was another 'No, you're mush, you're evil!' So.... that wasn't really engagable either.</p><p>Anyways, was a fun ship overall. Especially enjoyed interacting with Frieda, Raluca and Hua. (Dear gawd, Hua... to sum up: <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/fear.png" alt=":fear:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/omg.png" alt=":omg:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"> )</p><p>I think we got a decent handful of people who didn't really understand roleplaying. It was really cool to see people trying, though. I'm working on a tutorial to put up on group forums that should help people who are interested but need more information.</p>

She was part of a faction of Mush who respected humanity's right to individuality, set against the SDF, who saw humans as mere tools to aid Mush expansion. It worked very well for her role as astrophysicist, and the RNG was very kind - I think every expo but one was to a Cristalite planet! And even better, she found two of the starpmap fragments herself on expeditions (and Stephen found the third!) Good, faithful RNG. <em>(I'm kind of afraid of what awaits me in the future, to make up for this <img src="../../../../gfx/square/omg.png" alt=":omg:" class="tid_ico"> )</em></p><p>At the end of the ship, the mysterious Raluca was offered a chance to join the Mush. Stephen was concerned: her cryptic ramblings were clearly a sign of a fractured mind. Perhaps the Mush could help mend what was broken? <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/sF6449f.png">So... they asked her what she thought about the idea.</a> And then, to maintain maximum trust with the human crew, <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/XlGS9T6.png">had Raluca announce her decision</a>.</p><p>And then... <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/akKshv8.png">things took an interesting turn in the mush channel</a>. <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/5hneQDA.png">Stephen was horrified, and Frieda tried to stay positive</a>.

                <p>Howdy, Raluca here!</p><p>First, thank you guys so much for the compliments. When I was thinking of how to approach being Raluca I was very iffy about doing the theme I went with. I had to be talked into it by three different people. I barely got many responses at first and I was kind of discouraged until I started getting random compliments via pm. Ok, so maybe only a few wanted to interact but at least the rest seemed to be enjoying it. Also you have no idea how many times I had to google meanings and hit up dictionaries. XD</p><p>My normal Raluca was the common Raluca. She hated people an felt superior to all of them. When the crew went into cryo something happened. Raluca spoke of a cloud of energy that the ship flew through that "opened doors" to her mind and split it apart. You take that however you want to, maybe they flew through a cloud of dense radiation that the ship couldn't completely protect against. Either way, she woke up... different.</p><p>She saw the universe through new eyes. Eyes that weren't normal for a human. She heard the situation and came to the conclusion that she would do anything for the crew... THen the nightmares of the dark entity on Eden (she referred to as the "land of false promises" ). She explained to the crew that some horrifying fate awaited them but she couldn't describe it.</p><p>As the ship went on she would do random things to try and learn or do something "<a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/Zl7Sw2a.png?1">nice</a>" for the crew. Be it from making them aware how she sees them (then immediately touching their face) or inspiring the crew with <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/m80I7EO.png?1">poetry/music</a>. She had even wanted to throw a party for them but it didn't end up happening due to my laziness.</p><p>As they got closer and closer to finding the rest of the map pieces she began growing more and more concerned. She had forseen the gathering of the last piece in a nightmare. The next day she demanded and forced herself to be on the expo to prove it. The angry Stephen who went down with them, striking the crystal from 10 feet from her and discovering the last shard. She knew she wasn't crazy, but the rest still weren't convinced.</p><p>The days continued going by and as she had the same nightmare over and over, she began to feel a connection to the dark figure. Perhaps it was after her? She came to the conclusion that she was a conduit to the fade (a fog between dimensions in which souls gather and bring dreams and nightmares to the living). Her only choice was to not go to Eden. She asked the crew to respect her choice for "when the time came".</p><p>Now we come the day before departure. Stephen pops an idea. He figured that a mush symbiote would be able to reconnect the damage done to her brain. He feared losing her. Raluca didn't know whether to be offended by him not accepting her as she was or grateful that he would do such a thing based on the firm belief that it would help her. She tried to warn them of the person she was before cryo but they continued to convince her. Feeling alone in her mission... Not a single member of the crew believing her... he began to doubt herself. If she left them now and ended up being wrong about her visions then they may have needed her. Yet if she was right and went with then the creature might get to her. She decided that she would be there for them, no matter what. Even if it meant facing the darkness she would be there with them! Stephen and Frieda sent her on her journey and made her family...</p><p>She had awoken for a third time in her life. Utterly frustrated with the memories she had of her broken self. What an insane loon. Then there were those apes who pranced around, claiming victory over the hard work of Stephen and Frieda. Her first interpersonal connection (Kuan Ti doesn't count because he was a kitty cat) and the crew spat on them. Why do they deserve their good will? Then there was that sex offender cow who manipulated the most generous person she's ever known. Raluca tried to explain to her family the atrocities and foolish waste of good time their views were but to no avail... Stephen accused her of being a monster... No... She was the only one thinking clearly, they saw to that. She'll do what they ask because she loves them... But eventually Eden would grow too boring... Too confined... Eventually she would seek an escape... But she wouldn't just leave her family... There was only one way... To bring the SDF to finish this charade. Raluca was the darkness she had feared the entire ship... The conduit to herself... The one whose promises proved false...</p><p>I had a lot of fun creating my character and developing her as I went. Stephen had discussed with me via OOC about the turning (OOC guys, it's great for building stories with people!) and at first I wasn't going to do it. But then I realized the luck of everything adding up leading to this one moment and it was perfect.</p><p>I adored all of you who put yourself out there to entertaining for all of us. Ian's constant aguing with NERON, Andie's adorably vicious immaturity, Hua's aggressive and random sexual exploits, Stephen and Frieda's awesomeness in how they worked with Frieda, Gioele had fantastic plans but life got in the way. I also loved having my random moments with Derek "The Maiden" Hogan and Paola. Also it's a shame Chun was so busy, her personality would've went great with Raluca's. Also can't forget adorable Cat Ti who had some pretty hilarious posts.</p><p>A lot of people were scared to really get going with the rp but remember that this entire thing is to help create fun for everyone as well as yourselves. Don't be afraid to try new things, we wont let it fall flat, we never do. After all, I was worried about my character at first but it went quite well! I jumped on it and I don't regret it. I hope you all try an RP ship again and really put yourself out there because I know you guys can be extremely entertaining!</p>

                <p>Hi All,</p><p>Derek here. I had a lot going on IRL that limited my internet and computer access, but I tried to be as active as I could. I enjoyed this ship, and tried some new things with RP, though I was a bit sad that some of it went without any response.</p><p>From the likes on the end page, it doesn't seem like my character went over well...at all. I try to RP, even when I have limited available time on a ship to keep things interesting and to create interesting openings for other people to enjoy their characters. That being said, I was a kind of surprised at how much I was disliked.</p><p>I'd like to know more about why people didn't enjoy this ship with me so that I can do better in the future.</p>

You were a little more quiet than I had hoped but you were doing something interesting and out of the box with Derek. I enjoyed a lot of the IC arguments you sparked. Your character was a bit difficult to interact with (like mine) but I was definitely surprised to see you so low compared to a lot of people who were barely active.</p>
