Was from few people who began the ship, since i had some exams on the way i wanted to play in a role which isn't that important but still can help around the ship. I installed all cameras before mush selection and ended up in BD with no AP at all. I didn't had a bed and it was C7 and it was like my sleep time.</p><p>I gone to bed and next morning i woke up with this feeling "I AM MUSH FOR SURE!" I rushed to PC and guess what "WELCOME TO MUSH!" was first thing i saw <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I was really happy since i had another chance to play mush. ((I was mush before that in my other ship but i really couldn't do anything which i am sad about it)) So my partner was Gioele and seemed active. Finally i had a partner which isn't dead/exposed by mistakes.</p><br><p>But But But other crew were MONSTER! active , which made me rush to some places and get to know that day was Towards Eden jump. So i couldn't stop being even more excited about this,you know this game could REALLY turn to a great thing here. So as i started game i saw Sofa is not built so a great chance to get dirty.((Gioele got dirty that day before i wake up by getting dirty from camera which did us a great thing)) So i rushed to AD to see everything has already been take there. As i asked where are materials of Sofa i rushed to my other game and asked my from friend if possible send me golden days. Which was stupid since when i got back Terrence told me to use apron. Ok you may say "So what you could just say i forgot" BUT You can't just say "I forgot" When playing with players like TE crew <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>So i created sofa and missed the chance, i got back to AD and that thing of me seemed earned some trust. But after talking with Gioele for hours we reached this point which an infection rampage is best fit. We agreed to show up in C6 and infect Terrence((which had one spore)) together , then Gioele transfer to Janice and i kill Raluca. We wait and in Day change turn Eleesha.<br>But sstrickl couldn't sleep and early that day had done something great! Terrence had asked for a food and Gioele got it for him, but Terrence greedy side ((<img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)) Didn't cooked it and we had a new partner.</p><br><p>When i got back i was like "Good one Gio" xD Seriously I had finally one hell a partner! So we started with plotting all together. Plan was kind of same but now with three high lvl mush its far easier.</p><p>Since its getting long i will just go for second post <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p><strong>Our GREAT Plan of Infection</strong><br>So plan was like this , AD had Eleesha,me,Terrence,Ian And Janice all together. Gioele was in other dorm and had one spore. We could extract one more spore. So we waited for C8. I got Fertile,Defacter,Transfer,Infector skills and waited. Before one hour to cycle change i start dropping and picking my Italkie which after many tries just made my health go down by two ((which later on paid off greatly!)) 3 min before cycle change i rushed outside and extracted , then in 1:30 min i got back inside and pushed Ian out and sleep. Now 50 seconds and i was refreshing like crazy to see if Gioele came inside or not. He made it in last 15 second and infected Eleesha.</p><br><br><p>Now look we are talking about Peanutz here, he can run whole ship in less than 30 seconds so we must been really fast. Day changed , i defacted ,extracted and gone for infect. BUT Eleesha ran outside , But had been infected by Gioele before running outside. So I had few MP and needed all my APs and didn't had Italkie since i dropped outside. I rushed to RC since i knew She would run for Ian protection and found her there , now without a moment to stop i infected her and she got mush before leaving room. ((Peantuz again its such honour to be person to turn you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)) Then i get back to AD took blaster and lenses and gone to Nexus and killed Raluca. Had only two MP and one AP left. Got back inside infected Janice,dropped everything and transfer. ((ALSO forgot to say as Day changed and Eleesha ran out i got hit by a metal sheet THANK YOU RNG <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">)) Now i was Janice full bar of AP, got knife and rushed to kill Derek under defactor and BY LAST two AP i had i killed him. Took Diplomat and ceasefire.</p><br><p>Terrence and Eleesha gone to bridge and turned Frieda which had one spore from start. Now from here things turned some cool part. Eleesha got Stephen body and learned Diplomat and got us another three cycle of ceasefire. Then we got diplomat book for Gioele and he got another three cycles. Also Terrence was strangly trusted by human crew. Now by day change we all rushed to medlab. Jin was quick to run away but heh i got Eleesha so i can't take him? I turned him to mush got back to medlab infected Andie which was there and Frieda finished the job. So from here we killed Paola and another human. Turned some other people which actually i forgot and so many transfer here and there and finally! We had a full crew of mush and one human pet. We lived till D12? I believe and got two starmap but oh well <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>Seriously we had many chance to find it but RNG didn't helped us here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Sorry for talking long, feel like Europa but with Shit grammar <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> I like to thank Gioele and all people in this ship to make this great trip possible.

                <p>Hi, Jin Su here. I was our poor vampire commander who tried to kill you with Terrence... Who was already Mush. I was so sad when Mushs killed 3 humans, I thought you would to break my ship! But I was wrong. I didn't think Terrence was already Mush and I was worried for him because he was the last technician. *<em>Sighs</em>* I was worried for a Mush, finally.</p><p>Good job, Alpha, I'm feeling totally crushed by your superiority. I even tried to run when you infected me, but I was at 0 ap and Janice was full... So I could do nothing.</p><p>I'm only sad because I didn't success to have a Mush baby with my darling (Eleesha, then... Stephen!). Janice tried to help us but she wasn't pregnant. Thank you to tried, Lady Sergeant! We will have a baby on Sol!</p>

                <p>Hey there, my little mushroom friends, and my darling vampire commander.</p><p>As Soroosh said, the ship was quite active from the start, research went very well (we hated ourselves for that afterwards), we did a nice little expo... I started collecting the D2 logs and organizing them, and was about to read them in detail, when... right before day change, I saw Derek kick Ian out of the room. I was just about to run away when I saw Gioele spike me. I tried to run faster, but Derek caught me in the corridor, and as I was entering Bravo Bay, I was already mush.</p><p>In the mush channel, I was greeted by Derek, Gioele... and, surprise, Terrence, who had been converted a few cycles earlier by eating a ration brought by Gioele. Tsk. That's when things started to get really messy. Murder of Raluca, Derek's transfer to Janice, conversion of Frieda, me transferring to Stephen and killing my old body... The logs were a <strong>huge</strong> mess, with Gioele, Derek, Eleesha, Frieda, Ian, Terrence entering and leaving several times, Ian and Stephen being kicked out from the dorms, mycoalarms ringing, two defaced rooms, not to mention the others moves, Terrence and I going to the front of the ship, Frieda coming back with the cat... I don't think anyone could have understood exactly what happened, except maybe with Tracker and an aspirine. Ian tried to understand but couldn't do much. The other humans who were awake chose to stay in bed, and it wasn't until Jin Su woke up that they started to find out what had happened. At least the identity of the mush wasn't difficult to discover, since we were all huddled in Alpha dorm under a triple ceasefire.</p><p>At the next day change, Jin Su then Andie joined our little family, we got rid of a few humans, and Andie transferred to Kuan Ti, our inactive human. Then we converted Ian, who had bravely tried to investigate the situation among conversions and murders, and he became Roland. That poor Roland... He was a once-a-day player, and woke up one day in a messy situation, with a few dead humans and four known mush (five, in fact) protected by a ceasefire. He woke up the next day, still human, but had become Ian, completely out of AP, surrounded by dead human bodies and living mush. The following day, he was still Ian, but mush. All this confused him a great deal and it took him at least a day to ask what was going on in that ship and who was mush. We explained, he became Andie... and was pretty much useless until the end.</p><p>So there we were, eight active mush (Frieda unfortunately became idle, which was sad because she had been active and helpful), a mush cat (of course), and a little human pet, Ian, whom we tried very hard to keep alive. We healed him, checked him every cycle, comforted him... but in the end, his poor little human's subconscious must have panicked too much, and he committed suicide.</p><p>And so our brave attempt at reaching Eden ended, sadly, with two starmaps pieces and a slight chance to find the last one if we had been a little more lucky and if everyone had been fully cooperative. But the RNG being very angry at us (the gravity simulator was broken twice during the last day and the engine room was destroyed by a spike, then caught fire), and trying to run a ship without food (though we had plenty, including three or four jumpkins) or spores (half of us didn't have Phagocyte) was really difficult. After Ian's death, all we could do was finish Pilgred and go back to Sol.</p><p>A very fun ship indeed. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>If you were an <em>active</em> human Ian, then for sure, you should be trying to sabotage that ship anyway possible, including getting yourself killed if need be. You definitely shouldn't be going meekly along with the Mushes to infect Eden! We only chose our Ian pet because they were inactive, and ended up killing other active humans we could have converted if we'd taken risks by waiting longer to act on them. (Which, in the end, did make things a bit painful by meaning less Mush to help out, but it was the right move by us, since otherwise it'd be a good question of whether the humans were in any way trying to co-op with us.)</p>

                <p>I didn't say he shoudl cooperate, but last human harming himself seems totally unfair. It does not cost any ap and can be done as often as wished, that seems not good in any way. <br>Of course choosing inactive person as human pet is best solution, but maybe there is no inactive person on that ship. Shoudl that mean that then mushes have no chance at all to establish a mush eden by converting almost everyone?<br>Actually no human is supposed to know that if they die, NERON will exterminate the mushes, so actually human would try its best to break out of the guarded room, but not kill themselves (especially when they have high morale xD ).</p>

I got curious about 1 thing. Could the Ian have purposely destroyed his health/morale to the point of almost dying, so that they would have to heal him (assuming they <strong>REALLY</strong> want to keep him alive) and get them to use tons of action points, then use that fact to kill them. Or would that be against the rules?</p><p>P.S. Sorry about the suggestions for an unfinished ship, will not do that again.</p></cite><p>That's the situation we wanted to avoid at all cost, and that's why we killed the remaining active humans : we didn't want to put someone, even a pacifist Ian, into that kind of situation. We wouldn't have done that with an experienced Ian, who may have found ways to hinder us and whom we would have ended up killing anyway (or converting, before rushing to Sol or getting killed by Neron). But unfortunately, some experienced players would have played it passively and hoped to be converted or be taken to Eden. It would have been even worse with a beginner, like our Chun, who probably had no idea what was happening. It would be unfair to put someone in a situation in which they are forced (or encouraged) to play against their team.</p>

I also got lucky that my deciding to try fungal kitchen despite never trying it before and never thinking it would work actually worked, and didn't just waste two spores and two AP.

Just don't give up hope, you'll find (or be!) the antagonists you want to play against (or as!) <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></cite><p>I've only been Mush twice so far and the 1st time, the ship pretty much destroyed itself. We had a Paranoid Ian who accused me of being Mush (which I was &gt;_&gt; ) and then proceeded to be hostile and flamey with everyone around him. I played victim and the crew sided with me because a Frieda who finds them nice planets couldn't possibly be Mush, right? I spiked Jin Su twice before an expo (I had Astro, Pilot and Surv) mainly because he was silly enough to touch the boobytrapped shelf and then I just spiked him again and Terry (my alpha Mush partner) and I were gonna comvert him but Paranoid Ian decided Jin was Mush and killed him. Then we were gonna convert Andie but again, Paranoid Ian decided Andie was Mush and killed them as well. That was 2 pilots dead, hunters were gathering, some people were inactive and the Hull was dropping. Since all our conversion plans failed, we just convinced the crew that Hua was Mush too and Terry finished her off while I took off in a Patrol Ship to "shoot some hunters" then I came back on the ship and we all blew up on cycle change. Ian's last words in the end of game were "Thx useless pilot, especially Frieda". And then at the top of the glory rankings there was Terry first (cause he killed Hua) and me second (who did most the dirty Mush work in spite of being Frieda. So Ian was right but his toxicity saved me.</p><p>And the second time, I was Derek Mush with inactuve Hua partner but, even tho I did nothing Mushy per se, Roland somehow knew it was us and killed us both before we even got to do anything.</p><p>And well, when other people are Mush, they would rather kill me than convert me (the pain of playing Janice .-.) or they simply leave me be no matter who I play &gt;_&lt; Then again, my Mush level is only 7 since I only started playing rouggly a month ago or so .-.</p>

                <p>Somebody called my name? Where didn't you kill me when you found who I was, so far once we met we're both human.</p><p>Soroosh, you're crazy. The way you're writing is like you were a psycho, but how you caught the most serious people on that ship sounds funn... amusing. I enjoyed reading that. You caused the simple annihilation of humanity, by converting some and killing some. You and your partner ensured the Mush victory, congratulations.</p><p>Actually I used to happen in every 2 ships that calmly on the ship I break this calm and out of nowhere I start killing someone and if someone else is active then they're trying to kill me (you know, attack without evidence I must die before I kill him, irreversible symptom from ship "Missing Eden"<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> until I finally finish the Mush... but with second one it takes me ages although my list about who cannot be their partner is never wrong, it leaves some people which I try to decrease to one, but this one can quickly backstabs me. I guess that if I was on your ship, <span class="tid_strike">as I am so awesome you'd get no way to get me alive I'd destroy you all!</span> I'd get converted as one of the first and forced to reach Mush win which would be indeed successful.</p><p>Anyway if you want to catch me... well you can't catch me, but I might catch you if I wish... actually I see you're currently on ship, but well... you mainly might find me stalking some TE jumps where I try anonymously join them, try to find sperbi and Europa somewhere.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">Btw you have a marvelous avatar, Soroosh.</span></p>
