They're great people, I've employed thousands of Rebels, I have a great relationship with the Rebel people. I love the Rebel culture, I had just contacted a Rebel Base today. But when the Rebels send their Commanders, they're not sending their best. They're bringing Griefers, they're bringing first time players, they're bringing Braindeads, some there I assume are good people. People come up to me and tell me: Mr. Gioele Trump, the Rebel people love you. That's what they say. I'm going to do great with the Rebels, in fact a poll came out from a Rebel base recently, I polled 9000 Glory with the Rebels; someone said if you get 50% of the Rebel Glory, the mush invasion is over... but if I'm elected Commander, we are going to Serum ALL the mushes. Bigly. We have to Serum the mush, or we won't have a Daedalus any more. Look we're smart people, aren't we folks? Yes we're smart folks. Don't listen to the lyin' SDF, we're going to make the Daedalus great again. We're going to become tremendous again, just yuge. Hunters are killing us right now, look at the Traxes, look at the Arracks. My Daughter is a rebel, she goes on the radio and contacts them it's amazing. So we're going to build a wall around the Daedalus and make the mush pay for it, believe me. We have to get back to work on Mush research folks. We can't let these braindeads flood our Daedalus. With their inactivity and their newbieness. Believe me. We have to Drain the Swamp here on the Daedalus. Wang Chao would roll over in his grave folks lemme tell ya; if he saw what was going on with the inactives ruining everything all over. Jin Su and crooked Janice are some of them folks, them and inactive ways. Were gonna knock them out. It's incompetent what's going on. Just like the injuries coming out of cyro. We have to repeal and replace our cyro machines like this. We will restore law and order to the Daedalus. That's my contract with you fine folks. My promise to you, the people. The Daedalus community has suffered for far too long. The rebellion or its people will no longer surrender to the false song of inactive Commanders. <strong><em>We Will Make the Daedalus Great Again</em></strong>.</span></span></p>

                <p>Well... <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"> here! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This ship was one, huge parade of obstacles! Every single time we thought we managed to acomplish something, another problem, far worse than previous showed up. And it ended only when I managed to return ship sol.</p><p>You allready know starting condition of said ship - 30% hull, most of crew inactive or mush. Keep note - Veren counted Frieda as one of inactives. In truth that was Mush playing inactive. Another one was Roland, and he was active all the time OK. OH! And Ralulu! Ralulu was dead from morale. She was such a genius that decided to stay in dorm with people for company! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>From my perspective this ship was investigator's nightmare. With half the crew being inactve and half of active crew behaving really suspicious, I could not really trace mush. Not that I am good at tracing mushes - I don't think I am good. But here? Half of active humans were visiting BDorm regullary. I have feeling that they were following rule "Day without random visit in BDorm is day lost!". Why nobody died for this very reason? Because we had so many problems that killing somebody was luxury we could not afford. Let me see...</p><p>Our Hull was reduced to 10% if I remember correctly. Our oxygene was dropping steadly (it was our major problem at end of ship!). Our morale was also in great problems without Janice's support... Oh! And because we could not hope that our pilots will shoot down all hunters (Hua with broken finger and Roland being mush...) we just had to move ship which caused Paola loose contact bases... YES! ALL OF THEM! No morale for us! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So... So I will say, this ship put really big pressure on human team.</p><p>Things that did saved us? I will be honest here - poor mush play. That is THE ONLY thing that saved this ship. If mushes would put even halfly decent work to destroy this ship it would be over on first day after being filled! Period! Nothing I am writing down would made change should mushes decided REALLY PLAY this ship.</p><p>What else saved us? We had three active techs! That was life-saver. And all of us were humans! Active, competent humans. Firstly we managed to set up Plasma Shield together with KT. It took us really just one cycle! BOOM! Plasma Shield is done! No more troubles from hunters (yea, as I said, there were constant troubles - hunters stopped to be, oxygene started to be!).</p><p>Something else that saved us? Well... Not something... Somebody... Hua saved us! She was active, competend and was Pilot/Tech! Yes! If She would not managed to shoot down all fighters at some point we would be dead first few cycles. We got down to 10% of hull and yet she managed to save us. Later on she found out that somebody was playing with fuel during our Mankarog Expedition and so Frieda got killed (in Jin Su's body). So here we have it! Hua saved us!</p><p>Paola also in some ways saved us! She did three NERON Updates. THREE!!! Every single one of them was GREAT! Fire Detector, LPS and... Oxygenerated Ducts! YES! It worked just once during whole game. Just once... But that 1 more oxygene was what changed this ship from Sucide Cascate to something that had still chance to survive...</p><p>Damn. This is getting chaotic. I don't feel like writing story today. Ok? I will write it tommorow. Or after. I don't want to prommise anything as I hate to not deliver prommises. So no promisses <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Oh! Look at that... Prommises and Promisses. Interesting writing of me. Know what? I will leave it like that - have fun! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>BTW - did I told you that this ship made me stay awake till 3AM yesterday? Me, Hua and KT... That is it! Today earlier sleep is a must! GOOD NIGHT! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

But this ship gives me HOLY RIGHT TO COMPLAIN <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Yes, even if complains and threats are not backed with actions. SO I DAMN SWEAR I WILL KILL YOU JUST FOR ENTERING BDORM! EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU! <em>(this is the moment when I expect You to act like You are completly terrified and absolutly believe every exagerration I am putting here).</em></p><p>To be absolutly serious Veren did pointed out HOW it was all happening with BDorm. When somebody takes investigation on himself and enters BDorm that looks way diffrently than when half incompetent/half inactive player goes there and out and does silly mistakes. So You would most propably be left alone on ship with me even if You would enter BDorm many times as long as I could see You do good for ship. But nevermind that...</p><br><p>I don't know if You realise how close to slow oxy/morale death we were <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> When I was hacking Commander Terminal I had AP just for two chances. And first one failed! If I would need to do it third time, I would not have AP to move us Sol! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> It might be strange but I honestly was hacking it with my eyes closed! I was so damn stressed!!! Also I was affraid that ship will get to kill Stephen (title holder) rather than Frieda (HK Holder)! That would get us nowhere really since title does not returns same cycle - only after cycle change. I am glad that You guys keept focussed on what was said.</p><p>To be honest this whole ship become most stressful for me from moment that we got second mush. One would think this is moment where Eleesha should get "vacations" since no more mushes and so... But way I am playing Eleesha... I am Choosing Tracker and than IT, Tech and Poly! I am going into ultimate ship maitendence build for her, not for complete mush hunter. So when I saw that there is no more oxy for us... That was moment I knew that my REAL work begins. I tried to keep everybody focussed on what was important. Thanksfully nobody objected (though Paola did RIGHTFULLY asked crew questions about possibility of me being mush). In the end coordinating TECHS and rest was easier than expected. Maybe because those who were still active really wanted this ship to succed in the end? Or maybe because what I was saying in open discussion was something everybody figured out on their own that should be done and just got streghened in this decision by me? I don't know! Point is - crew worked like clockwork after that and did everything that was needed... Exept of Mr. Gioele Trumph. He unfortunatly did not managed to get online in time and died to lack of morale. That pushed great preassure on us... Thanksfully Hua had AP to kill Frieda (KT was also able to help a bit in case it would not happen) and I managed to hack in and return ship Sol. Please, never again!!!</p><p>Ok... So when do we go AGAIN? ^^</p>
