However, we lacked pilots and technicians. On day 6 the inactives died, Paola got too depressed and died as well. The following day, more things went wrong. Bits of the ceiling toppled over on Eleesha's forehead and she died. We were left with 9 crewmates. We ran out of food. Hunters were everywhere, our hull got penetrated to a mere amount of <strong>2</strong>. The Daedalus flew left and right to avoid hunters. The turrets were used to their fullest potential, but still there was this 1 trax. We thought we couldn't pull through, but surprisingly we did! The trax didn't attack! We were clear of hunters on day 8, but alot of hunters swarmed around us on day 9. The combustion chamber malfunctioned, so our commander couldn't move the ship. And then finally I was shot in the chest by a hunter. Everything went black.</p><p>The Mush didn't really do any harm, but we couldn't fix the PILGRED due to the lack of technicians, and we had very little pilots. Chun and Finola didn't speak alot, though they did do their jobs. Everyone scattered everywhere to fire turrets, thus many of the beds were empty. Food supply was low, bananas were rationed to those with empty stomachs. Had we an active Terrence and Raluca, we would've returned to Sol. Had we better AP distribution and planning, we might have got to Eden. But for me, most of my AP was put to good use. I also always made sure I had enough AP to return to a bed therefore more productivity and glory earned.</p>
