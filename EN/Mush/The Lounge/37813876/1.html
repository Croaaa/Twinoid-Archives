I feel a bit vain being the one to post this, but, if you haven't guessed yet, I am <strong>Jin Su</strong>, the ever amorous-and-sometimes-useful captain. I do my best. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This ship had a FANTASTIC start. Plasma shield early, an OCD Finola who ROCKED at pumping out research, and a project team who knew what they were about well enough to get stuff done. We struck tragedy relatively early though when our Mush began their rampage. Our first mush, Stephen, was inactive all the way up until he had full gauges. He then proceeded to go on a mutapage, killing Chun and Raluca. He would've gotten Janice if Janice hadn't listened to Finola and left in time.</p><p>The girls teamed up on him in Bravo Dorm and laid major smackdown on him, and proceeded to kill him. But it wasn't over yet, we still had a Mush remaining. Well, two players we had were inactive, Gioele and Terrence. We weren't too sure about the likelihood of one of them being Mush, because it wasn't time yet. But we had Pheromodem and were able to see Stephen's last message to his partner, so we knew there was another one. It turned out to be Paola, and we found out by way of Pheromodem. Regrettably, we couldn't cure her, try though we might have. We had to kill her.</p><p>The two inactives starved out later, leaving us with a crew of ten tight knit active people. Finola, whose expertise in lab was absolutely fascinating. I've never seen a research person do that much research in so short an amount of time. Kuan-Ti, despite his activity being relatively low, still managed to do as asked, and Roland popped in from time to time to handle hunters.</p><p>Hua, my Hua. You were brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. I have NO idea how you racked up that much AP, and how you managed to do so much good for us. You saved our keisters so many times from the hunters that I can't even count. Sexy Hua is sexy.</p><p>Ian did fantastically on plants, maintaining them well. Rap-man scatman, here's to you. Eleesha, the ever amorous and skillful technician who was on call to handle the O2 tanks whenever they broke down, and did brilliantly on comms despite a missing Paola. Chao, of course, was our adorable newbie. Frieda did well on Planet scans, and would've done better if not for her horrid luck (I'll leave it to her to tell THAT particular story...)</p><p>The last person I'm going to dedicate a paragraph to is Janice. Janice, our Janice, who brilliantly maintained morale and lead expeditions finely. If I had to pick one person on this ship I'd want to play again with most, it'd certainly be you. Your positive attitude and skillful way of handling everything and keeping morale up both in the game and out was a joy, and you were amazing to be with on this ship.</p><p>That's all I'm going to say in my opening paragraph. This is <strong>Jin Su</strong>, welcoming my crew to Sol.</p>

I didn't interact with others much, as all Ian does is sleep and treat plants ¬_¬ [good for me].</p><p>I really regret that we lost our Chun, I knew stephen was dodgy and I wanted to limit access to the weapons, a a true pacifist. <em>Chun</em>, you were greatly missed, especially by me, I almost decided to eat bunch of pills and die, but <em>Janice</em> was coming and hugging me, while I was asleep and I guess I moved on.</p>
