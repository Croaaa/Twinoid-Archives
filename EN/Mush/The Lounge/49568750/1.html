                <p>Hello,</p><p>I had 3 lives on this ship:</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"> My first life started as human Ian, trying my best for humanity and pushing the research.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/mastered.png" alt=":mush_mastered:" class="tid_ico"> My second life I lived as mushy Ian, helping the mush cause and becoming the guardian of the mush prince.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/stock.png" alt=":mush_explo_feed_1:" class="tid_ico"> In my third life I became Andie, trying my best to help the mushy crew getting to Eden though it failed in the end. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>Nevertheless it was a fantastic ship, and if our only human Chun wouldn't have suffered from 2 steel platings in a row /someone would have been online to notice it in time I guess we would have had the chance to make it happen.

These were the alphas, I am only a beta mush, though the first one and "blessed" already from the beginning with a starting spore, I will wait a bit therefore before maybe telling something more about it besides of the things I tell you already ^^. <br>Together we got the ship converted in almost no time, and the more mushes we got, the more help we got of course too, otherwise it wouldn't have worked that smoothly.<br>Until the last conversions we converted them all sneakily (with anonymush) without any human noticing anything, it was beautifully done!<br>Also we had many great people on this ship besides the ones I already mentioned: Especially Frieda, Paola, Terence, Gioele, Hua and Jin. They all were very nice and helpful, I liked the atmosphere on this ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Thanks for this great experience!</p>

                <p>I don't usually partake in after party threads but I'll make an exception because of you, Sperbi. You were a (dominant even) driving force behind the ship and deserve the recognition as well as a response.<br> <br>The usual goal for me when I get to be Mush is to convert as many people as possible because I feel like that's the best way to have fun not only for myself but for the opposing side as well. It just so happened that you had a spore lodged in your body after waking up that made it a viable option to solo convert you while you were sleeping in the Medlab as Ian, and that's how you became the first beta Mush - the guardian of Mush-kind as it were <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br> <br>Stephen and I (the two Alpha Mush) had been discussing various options and strategies already and when the opportunity presented itself we took it. What a worthwhile risk it was! With the active Ian on our side the conversion game suddenly felt a lot more achievable. We had previously gathered that the most dangerous people on the ship were (based on their activity and experience) Ian, Frieda, Hua and possibly Gioele. With one of those down only a few remained before eternal bliss could be achieved...<br> <br>Eternal bliss was indeed in the cards. In the following days ballsy attempts at covert conversion were initiated which, if certain humans had been paying attention to the logs, would have ended in nothing but catastrophe but alas Luck of the Mush Heroes dictated a clear path - a path of new beta mushrooms. I myself thew caution to the wind and went for a solo, non-defaced conversion of Paola <em>while she was active</em> on the bridge. A successful conversion but not without risks. I had casually removed the camera before converting her while reinstalling it imidiately after the fact. <strong>Somehow</strong> the active human Hua didn't notice the logs even though she visited the bridge but a few seconds after the conversion and in the middle of my attempts at spamming/hiding the camera logs. Instead this human Hua focused all of her attention on my (Kuan Ti's) skill called "Politician". I was caught red handed yet Hua seemed to only have noticed my skill selection and not the logs. What luck! It was the deciding moment between a full crew conversion and a Mush rampage.<br> <br>Fast forwad a few days and the entire crew had painfully converted under complete cover. No one noticed a thing. That's when we set out to find Eden under Ian/Andie's orders with the inactive Chun as our hostage.<br> <br>Instead of boring you with several days worth of planet scanning, Chun-healing and planet exploration I'll just leave you with the fact that Chun died of steel plate related injures while the Mush had but one star fragment in hand. Close but no cigar.<br> <br>A big thank you to Ian/andie (sperbi) for being very enthusiastic throughout the journey, something that convinced me that it was worthwhile to look for Eden even after converting everyone.<br> <br>Peace.</p>

                <p>Thanks for joining, Flash <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So I got you into an Ap-thread, nice! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> You forgot though, that you were a driving force as well and you showed an amazing amount of patience here towards anyone on the ship. I remember the one time at the end of our conversion time where we told Jin to infect Gioele twice, who was expected to be online soon again, but Jin infected mistakenly my old body Ian twice instead. I couldn't help but letting out a bit worry, but you calmed us quickly down and...in the end you were right, we were still able to infect Gioele and everything went well <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But it was funny how worried you were after converting me that someone noticed a new mush in the mush bar just the few seconds it took you choosing anonymush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> It was not even during day change. In that moment I actually thought: "Wait, seriously. Hm, is he playing only in hardcore castings normally? ^^"</p><p>It was a very fun game, I enjoyed and was mostly excited every day. I am glad about meeting you as well as many other people on the ship.<br>A special mention also to the new players: Gioele and Terrence both seemed to be new, but wow, they both are very enjoyable to play with as well as willing to help much and learn new things quickly!<br>Keep up the good work!</p><p>Also I was surprised about the high amount of high-level mush we had on this random ship though, seems like it is time to expect every second active mush having infector now. ^^</p>
