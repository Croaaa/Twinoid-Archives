                <p>We had Neron quarantine Chun and Hua both and Frieda first picking pilot over Astro, then we killed her for being mush. Mute Derek died of morale loss after accomplishing little, but only Eleesha died from idleness in the lab. We lost KT half way to a late onset of cryosickness (or vacation as some people call it).</p><p>As Ian, I asked Raluca to come and help pushing research and against all odds we found support in each other against the many obstacles. Stephen and Raluca had physics, not chemistry to bind them.</p><p>Stephen was soon added to my circle of friends in the laboratory but I was plagued by nightmares and as we completed the Natamy rifle together, and we had had time to go on one failed expedition, we believed the most likely and dangerous mush was Lady Janice. There were other suspects, but no one else seemed to have opportunity to turn the ship against humanity. Armed with the Natamy Stephen was sent to the Icarus Bay, moments before take-off and tried to shoot her. He was armed, but we did not have the knowledge to carry it out correctly. The expedition was cancelled, and the experiment failed. Stephen picked up shrink skill before the attack.</p><p>Meanwhile we had growing suspicions about Pilot Bergman. It was a highly unusual skill choice for her, at the same time she brought out snippets of commentary that showed a greater understanding of the journey. While I was engaged elsewhere with my seed catalogs, Raluca and Stephen carried out the second Natamy testing with great success. We were ready for the second phase in research.</p><p>The paranoia and mush hunt went on until day 7 (?) when we cured our lvl 6 JinSu from the mush fate with no beta mush onboard. Our decision was not purely based on suspicion, we also realized we needed him for the journey, as our Mr Rinaldo was active, but only intermittently 2-3 cycles per day, with limited language abilities. We were right about our Jin, except on one point; Jinnie, she turned out to be a reliable captain.</p><p>Lady Janice and Pilot Graham were constant companions on expeditions, often available just at the right time. We never needed to carry a weapon onto a planet in all the time we went out. We built up a nice selection of bumpjunkins as a reliable AP-source. But we were constantly unlucky with Fuel (HC=6) and rations. We had no luck at crystalites either, although I found one so mesmerizing that I decided to stay for a while. I brought a small shard of it back to Raluca.</p><p>Natives gave us two star map pieces but as the FOUR techs (from two tech books) were tending to the ship our Astrophysical scans were unproductive. Our main scanner Dr KT was lost to us and died. Lady J and Rinaldo were working hard, but - especially Rinaldo, with tech - were distracted elsewhere. The ship was starting to fall apart.</p><p>When most of Lady J's AP had to go towards healing and Rinaldo had no-crystalite and volcano planets we knew our journey was running towards the end. Pilots were struggling to keep up and our bountiful store of metals were dwindling.</p><p>On day 24 we decided to go home. The ship could have lasted a little longer, even with 33 hunters appearing outside. We had fuel for one more planet but no AP for scans and we wanted to bring the surviving crew with us rather than losing one or two members to accidental death.</p><p>If I remember correctly: We had Stephen, KT, Roland and Andie choose gold during the journey. Gioele was gifted gold for coffee, and we had hoped Astro. Janice and I had gold from day one. Bronze Paola with Radio was made more effective with a tech book, and so was Bronze Gioele with Paranoid (before gifting). Our third book was Radio and we had mainly weapon blueprints (with two diplomats, not too useful). The sofa was on the bridge, and oh so many times I wished for it in the refectory.</p><p>Now to the awards ceremony. By Dr Soulton.</p><p>Mr Rinaldo wins the prize for most times saved from below 6 morale/health.<br>Paola wins the prize for most confused crew member (she was dragged into an argument between two people by a third party)<br>Jinnie wins the price for last minute calls (number of times completing actions moments before cycle)<br>Raluca for resilience (I have other prizes to award her too)<br>Stephen for most emotional roller coasters (Natamy)<br>Terrence for effectiveness and team work<br>Janice for constant support<br>Andie for hard work and availability<br>Roland for Journey's best Newcomer (also the cleanest!)</p>

                <p>Hey Paola here. It was a very good ship and it was an honour to play with you guys! I really enjoyed it! It's a shame we couldn't get to Eden but oh well, we did what we could. It's a shame that Hua and Chun were quarantined but the ship was pretty much kept alive by a choice few. You know who you are. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> So thanks for that guys! Hope to play with you guys again. I'm on a ship currently, might even be in with one of you!</p>

                <p>hehe Commander Jin-Su reporting in, late as ever <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Not an awful lot to say about the mush side of things, third time as Mush Jin-Su and 3rd time with Bronze Frieda, and unsurprisingly all 3 times were "rampage or nothing" partners <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> <br>I certainly played my own part in the innaffectiveness of our team, but I really didn't want to just cause a few problems and then be killed, or suicide via Pasiphae. Not really my style.</p><p>I was pretty upset when I got cured, especially with Raluca being so annoying and asking why we didn't do anything. I was trying quite a few things and working towards openings but Frieda's tactical choice of taking pilot over Astro and then some bad luck timing wise really gave us so little chance to do anything <em>but</em> rampage. Eventually though I got over it and tried to be a competent commander. It was tough even though I am pretty experienced at it now, and I learnt a lot, sometimes through mistakes, or just from the great crew we had onboard.</p><p>There was a bit of needle between certain crew members and I upset Paola pretty badly via a misunderstanding and a single comment by myself. I found it pretty funny myself though <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Was a bit of a shame to have to return to Sol and I was against it while we had the chance of finding the map piece, but in the end we were close to being overwhelmed so we came home.</p><p>Losing Hua AND Chun via quarantine was a disaster, and had an inactive or two, but everyone else was fantastic, including Kuan-Ti who unfortunately died part way through. We ended up with loads of technicians which was pretty awesome and 2 shrinks, so our Pilots were able to keep on top of the enemy ships and asteroids for such a long time, and we collected so much scrap to upgrade our drones and repair the hull. Very very impressive crew. any questions?</p>
