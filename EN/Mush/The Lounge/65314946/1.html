                <p>As Mush is coming to an end, let's share our experiences while playing this game - how you would rate this game, best moments you remember from this game, great teamwork in challenging ship, brilliant roleplay, cruel betrayals, your gameplay - anything to your heart's desire.</p><p>I'll remember this game as my first deceit game I have ever played. It made me love playing games where the opponent's identity is unknown. 7 years ago I was impudent and egocentric who liked spreading controversy and this used to be my human play on ships and even my attitude on forums. Once I was really mad when I missed my first Eden - got killed by fellow humans as human. But now I've learnt not to blame teammates for mistakes, even when I get killed, it means I could have done something better to avoid it. I have changed after all those years even though a part of my past still stays, I try not to cause any negative reactions.</p><p>As human I stayed vigilant on ships trying not to miss any suspicious behavior, trying to predict how Mush would act. Even when initially I didn't intend to Mush hunt, somehow I got included sooner or later. Whatever didn't get me killed, I didn't follow meta which I considered suboptimal. I used to even argue about the metagaming. I didn't invite people to Mush hunt for solely being confirmed human. I usually picked people which I considered smart and trusted. I wasn't afraid of asking potential Mush for information regarding Mush hunt, with taking caution.</p><p>As Mush, I liked infiltrating Mush hunt whenever possible. I followed human meta accepting everything they were saying. I was a tryhard every time because non-rampaging Mush play is strongly unbalanced and difficult. I calculated all my actions, usually playing passive way but with a plan that would make it a won game or looking for opportunities.</p><p>I hated being considered confirmed human and tried hiding illnesses and food-testing whenever possible. I analyzed each crewmember and predict their Mush play. Humans hunting for Mush usually stayed passive waiting for confirmations until there's a really small group, sometimes it being too late because of Mush striking first. When I was certain someone of being Mush and I felt I could do it myself, I killed the suspect without asking anyone else for permission. When I felt I needed help as I have job to do, I tried convincing and reasoning others but when it didn't work, I threatened them that I would go to act if they don't do anything. When I was Mush, surviving a week wasn't a challenge.</p><p>I've never got Mush Eden, but as starting Mush, I have achieved many things worth remembering:</p><ul><li>simple rampage on the first day,</li><li>late rampage after surviving a week,</li><li>transfer to make humans kill each other,</li><li>be praised by humans for killing a human,</li><li>rush PILGRED and go to Sol,</li><li>let human send us to Sol,</li><li>sell human for PILGRED without any future plans (will I die first or be sent to Sol?),</li><li>join the ship just to bring the crew to Sol within 15 minutes,</li><li>transfer out of starving body to be considered "confirmed human",</li><li>discreetly convert half of crew,</li><li>manifestly convert half of crew without killing humans or occupying Icarus Bay.</li></ul><p>So how will you remember Mush? Share your thoughts!</p>

                <p>We just finished our ship - perhaps one of the the last ships - on D17. Ironically we had gone to a random planet in desperation, it *did* actually have cristalite (and Life and Shipwreck) that might have given us the last starmap fragment we needed. Jin Su was ready to give it a shot, but only 7 were left and not enough woke. I (Frieda) got nuked by room shake AND steel plate, so that was that.</p><p>But my abiding memory of Mush is from about 7 years ago. I was a bronze Jin Su with Leader skill (which I never used). Jin Su is not really a job for a bronze. But we got the fragments by D15. With Frieda keeping hunters under control, and Chun "Efficiency, efficiency!" keeping everyone alive, we hunkered down until D21. I did my part by logging on and moving from the waves of hunters, which by the last day were coming 75 at a time.</p><p>But I remember so many other ships. Ships where we pulled it through. The ship where I was Mush Eleesha and gave the all-clear, only to abandon 5 on a planet (the only time I have ever seen that Neron project be useful).</p><p>"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die."</p>

                <p>One of my fondest memories in Mush was making it to Eden with only 7 other people after everybody had given up already. I remember vividly how hard I was pushing and asking people to just give ourselves a chance. Ian was by far the most skeptical but hey, we made it and it was great! <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/13380" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/13380</a></p><p>There were a few other ships I have fond memories of and for those ships I've written after party threads already.</p>

                <p>My favourite memory was infecting Eden the first time as Mush-Andie after epic levels social engineering and trickery. I had to gain trust from Eleesha by being as useful as I can in every way. While trying to rush research, I tricked her into eating a double-contaminated consumable, converting her. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Once that is done, we finished RFS and pretended to "cure" a mush-teammate, and Eleesha declared us mush-free. From then on, the 3 sneaky mushies had to fly under the radar for many days, risking being exposed in expeditions, until we unlocked Eden...and then we hacked and forced us to Eden. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It was an achievement no one else I knew had ever gotten, so I was really really proud!</p><p>Soon after I took a 5 year break from Mush after achieved human Eden victory over a dozen times. Mush was fun but it's also addictive and it was affecting my work productivity haha.</p><p>I returned to Mush this year because I heard it's going to end. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Forturnately, I managed to infect Eden once more, this time as Eleesha. My strategy was roughly the same, with the exception of tricking proven-human Chao into eating an infected Ration after getting him to trust me. Then we put on a little show of "a mush rampages and then Chao bravely injects RFS into mush before they can escape on Pasiphae!" It was so fun playacting hehehe. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I will miss Mush a lot.

                <p>I remember joining a ship just shortly after the public release. I had no clue how to play, although I played D2N. I remember an early ship, making a mistake (the soap, I forgot to drop it) and the crew went all suspicious of me &amp; killed me. The game/players were somewhat unfriendly and intimidating (not as bad as reddit) there and then. The game was in its first couple of weeks of the public release but most onboard at the time had been beta testers. I gave it one more go, picked the wrong skill, but someone reached out to me after the game and I learned. Humanity shone through.</p><p>And then the people, the players began to make feel something more than just a game, just after the Christmas that first year. I joined the irc channel. Made mistakes there as Delzoup was watching! Oops! But then I watched irc too and caught someone else! There was a somewhat camaraderie n the irc channel. I miss some of the humour, the chat, and even friendship. I miss Spaz, and it was great getting to Eden with him.</p><p>It is a shame I didn't save all my NRJ stuff.</p><p>Dzanek has grown up since those early years of Mush. I remember thinking, not you again!</p><p>I had forgotten about D2N, as several attacks I had forgotten to return home to town, as C8 mushiness and that were happening. But I've since returned to D2N, and found the community there. We should be going boom tonight.</p><p>I wonder if the people behind Among Us ever played Mush.</p><p>I hope Eternal Twin keeps these wonderful games alive.</p>

                <p>Lot's of things happened, can't remember everything, but some moments i can recall:</p><p><strong>Top3:</strong> converted Finola in Medlab through sex, she had a starting spore. Chun was in the Medlab too and Mycoalarm was in the Medlab. I contacted Chun and asked her to leave Medlab, because "got 2 panic attacks and about to die", but she was offline. I came to Medlab on day change, pushed her out with Solid, knocked Finola off the bed, had sex with her in the presence of alarm (doesn't trigger it}, and had another sex after day change. Detectives inspected logs after and didn't find anything suspicious.</p><p><strong>Top2:</strong> humans about to suffocate, but we are at the orbit of O2 planet, i am pretending to be an inactive commander. 1 minute before cycle change Eleesha comes to the room and heals me to full hp. I start tossing my itrackie back and forth, got lucky and got injured. Eleesha detected me "starving", declared confirmed human and payed for it by getting abandoned on the planet with other explorers.</p><p><strong>Top1:</strong> actually a full flight. My partner was idle since the start, ship was super active, all research made quick. On day 8 or 9 everything looked like a typical ship with inactive mush + another mush pretending human and waiting for RFS. But as pilot Andie i managed to extract lots of spores and to spore 2 rations with 3 spores each. Which wasn't enough because of Mushovore. But rations were dropped and i had no opportunity to extract more spores, so 2 humans ate them and on the day change i converted 2 humans conventionally by removing cameras in the dorms. Suddenly Eden-like ship turned into chaos with paranoia kills and in the final i starting as solo alpha was vented out by Neron.<br>The ship:<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/13014" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/13014</a><br>A couple of screenshots:<br><a href="https://ibb.co/gjNnyKb" target="_blank">https://ibb.co/gjNnyKb</a><br><a href="https://ibb.co/f8CSvWC" target="_blank">https://ibb.co/f8CSvWC</a><br>Human private chat full of confusion:<br><a href="https://pastebin.com/pXJj0zip" target="_blank">https://pastebin.com/pXJj0zip</a></p>

                <p>I had some pretty crazy ships since I've been playing since launch, some quick memories were</p><p>•Asking mush comms officer to sell me, her mush partner, for a PILGRED trade and bring us home.<br><em>This one was in a previous account which i don't remember anymore</em></p><p>•Killing 12 players in one night, thanks to my active partner.<br><em>mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/13614</em></p><br><p>•Being a scumbag and taking advantage of game mechanics to figure out both mushes instantly on same cycle as selection (both of them had auto selected random skills, when pre selection they had 1/no skills.<br><em>Also on another account</em></p><p>•Having the best ship ever, fully active crew, mid season change so we had Andie, Derek, Chao, Finola and only 1 mush (who got figured out rather soonish and natamy'd to death).<br>Sadly it didn't end on Eden but we did a fun expo without bringing diplomats, on a dangerous planet, with Lizaro, Old faithful, 2 Grenades, Blasters and Knife.<br>I also trolled roland into thinking i was an anonymush playing a super long con before i pressed the Sol button... Pretty funny.<br><em>mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/13374</em></p><br><p>•I was a mush, started to get investigated on, and Roland wanted me dead, and he spoke in the third person and in dull terms, so i transferred into him, shot my old body and made it go mute, spoke in the human channel to come help kill my old body, convinced them i was still roland and that my old body was a sad loss, but he was being very suspicious. Ended up being a mush win. <br><em>Can't find this one</em></p><p>•Had a pretty intense hour on mush when i guarded FC with Paola, while jin was sleeping in BD and the others went to the expo, we were refreshing every second, suddenly Stephen barged in, and threw us out of FC, moved into bridge and found out HK wasn't even there like it was mentioned in the inventory thread, we rounded up the troops, Stephen was out of AP and failed at his task, he hadn't even loaded fuel. I mentioned this fact to him and he told me I'd be a mush by tomorrow, the expo crew came back, all trusted humans (Or so we thought), we were about to go in when i thought "Maybe i am spored, i should leave in case of transfer" Next time i refresh the game, Stephen came into FC, transferred into me, Paola closed all channels and said there was a transfer and so did i, she started attacking my old body, that's when Janice shoots paola and kills her because she thought she was the transferred and was trying to kill me.<br>Then i saw stephen hadn't closed his old channels, so i saw who the other mush was, and they were telling him everything we were about to do.<br>After both mushes were dead, the ship pretty much died on activity, we got to a crystallite planet, we had 3 hull, i went down on a patroller, got the crystallite and the ship exploded.</p><p><em>mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/14266</em></p>

                <p>personally, while eden runs &amp; the coordination with competent humans are enjoyable in their own sense, nothing beat the mush hunt part of every game for me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> even with the mush rampaging right at the start or just remaining inactive, i always got some sort of enjoyment surviving the aftermath of it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I would say my most memorable game is where I returned to Sol as a solo human Eleesha! There was nothing redeeming about the ship. It was during the time of the <em>ujrehfrujdshifu</em> griefers raiding every ship, and this was particularly bad. Maybe like 4 active humans... and 2 active mush! Those 3 other humans? not very helpful, they all died due to depression! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> RNG was totally in my favor though, as I managed to kill both mushes (one being ian) all by myself in a single cycle with a lucky headshot and good AP management (i want to say i read a shooter book to help myself but I can't remember for certain). After the mushes were dead there was one helpless inactive alive, and some strange aliens offering repairs for an exquisite cuisine. Of course I accepted it and returned home, all by myself <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Why is such a terrible ship my most memorable? Because it proves that there is never a reason to give up as a human, if I can do it as 1 human vs 2 mush, why can't anyone else? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>P.S. After finding the ship, I lied in my story. I traded inactive Stephen for PILGRED <em>BEFORE</em> killing Ian and Roland <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Wow, I must of been crazy! I mean, I know exactly why I did it in that order, but the luck needed to pull it off is absurd <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/11564" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/11564</a></p>

I was also too young to understand what Cowardly Commander Jin Su meant as his comments only flew over my head, and I regret for not replying back to the thread at year 2013 because I gave myself an excuse that I'm "not allowed to speak in these where 'grown ups talk' threads, and I'll get in trouble if I do". However, I did read the whole thread as soon it showed up, as my Mush partner <span class="tid_user tid_user_7899692 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7899692">agewisdom</span> has mentioned to me in that ship, and I really found it funny and really appreciated the whole writing. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br><br>And now time for me to brag briefly because I earned it. <em>See that awesome badge underneath my username?
