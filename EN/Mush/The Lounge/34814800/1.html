                <p>This was a neat ship, a difficult and unpleasant ship, a weird ship, and a confusing ship, and an awesome ship with a lot of first-time happenings for me all at once.</p><p>This was the first game I've played (my 10th game in all!) where every character in it at one point could be invited into a private chat. That has never happened to me before. Several players got their walkies this game, including some of the neat ones. But every one actually did play enough to get their walkie! Incredible! And though we had inactives, not one of our players started off as inactive. No character starved, and no character died of suicide. Furthermore, we had the microwave repaired and the connection to sol was broken by it only once. Utterly amazing to my experiences.</p><p><em>Gioele</em> broke my heart. Initially highly active, though without a chosen skill; he 'wasn't sure he packed his cameras' until a good bit after mush were chosen, then 'finally found them in his luggage'. I liked him enough to offer him a week of gold (having just renewed myself); he turned me down, then he 'offered' me his absence the rest of the game. The *bleep* even had the indecency to have left us while he was holding the superfreezer, while taking up a bed in Bravo Dorm. Sheesh. Eventually I punched his inactive rear out of bed, eventually injuries removed him from play - conveniently about 6 cycles after we finished our first expo, so at least it was possible to freeze the alien steaks we got before they rotted.</p><p>He'd told me he never had been on a ship that made it to day 10; guess what, Gioele-jerk; this one made it to D7C4. If you'd stayed and helped, we might have gotten to D10. Sometimes you have to help, ya know? These things don't 'just happen'. We needed you, and you left us. Gosh, thanks.</p><p><em>Kuan Ti</em>, I wasn't sure if you were a mush, a griefer, or a very confused newbie. I know you got your talkie this game, but apparently it's possible to reset the tutorial. First you started advancing a project right out of the gate; then after being told publicly and also in a private message, which you answered and agreed to cooperate in, you did the opposite of what you told me and advanced your chosen project again, with the reason when challenged being 'you were sleepy and you forgot'.</p><p>Then, our microwave fixed, and a big red and bold dotted post from me warning people not to use express cook when we have a comm signal - you go and use express cook, breaking our link. The only player on the whole ship to do so - and boy, do we have some difficult players, and mush still aboard.. but you ignore the warning and take the free ap cooking at the wrong time. You also were eating, but using most of your AP as near as I could tell to flirt and wander aimlessly around the ship - all this stuff's pretty reasonable behavior for a Mush. In the end I told you very firmly how to behave, but I'd already started the first stage of your jury, to judge if you should be killed. The first set of 5 players agreed, so everyone else got invited to consider the evidence and vote, though not everyone had voted, it was time and enough had agreed. I do hope you keep playing, if you are a newbie, and that you're having a great time. If you are a griefer - Twinoid's watching, and you will be caught. It might take a bit, but I trust the process.</p><p><em>Ian</em>, wow. I doubt you'll read this, because you didn't appear to read anything else. You dropped your communicator, picked up and primarily held the apron all game, ignored whispers explaining how to communicate and requests of how to behave, ate a bunch of food, and mostly spent the AP it seems wandering around. You sure did understand how to work the coffee machine and what cycles coffee could be gotten; you did plant a few bananas. Your behavior was reasonable for a Mush but wow, you were human. You're reported, Jerk. I seriously doubt your 'playstyle' will be allowed to continue for long. You too found your talkie this game - but again, a player can choose to turn the tutorial on each game. Griefing, even subtle griefing is <strong>not allowed</strong> and you were a pest, a bane, and a problem all ship long.</p><p>There, that's all the bad things discussed. Now, lets give the rest of you my loving attention. I was Jin Su, for the very first time. That made you my crew, and wow, though I'm leader-like when I play, there really is something about being Jin Su. Thanks, crew!</p>

                <p>There was Hua, newbie Hua, who I talked through her first fighter flight, sitting and sweating with her, trapped off the ship without AP, each of us in our own fighters and wondering if we'd be alive to land or if some hacker would have left without us that first day... talking through scrap collection, heh, this was my first time as a pilot too. You were the first player I ever sent a mission to. Then you went inactive on us. Missed you kid, hope you play some more later. You were a pleasure to play beside. (what's the difference between Hua and Gioele? Gioele was very much NOT a newbie... and he made that very clear to me).</p><p>Eleesha, amazing and strange Eleesha. You were a player from the French server; amusingly this game I started playing on the French server too, a couple days before your death in our game here. I learned how to use my translation program and gained the confidence to step in and talk to you and the rest of the players in both languages (I actually do not speak French... except with electronic aid!). You messed up because you didn't work hard enough to read everything. A very poor choice to play an investigator that must read and talk to people when your communication skills are very very poor. Pick characters like Paola; Ironic to be a communications officer that can barely communicate, but the range of things that need to be expressed between Paola and her ship are actually very small, you can focus on the comm terminal and AP control and hardly speak at all.</p><p>Instead, Eleesha wandered the whole ship, 'investigating', a scary use for AP which could have been put to research and/or projects, which would have been useful. Eleesha did move almost all of the expo equipment to Icarus Bay, but that was her sole useful contribution to the ship that I know of that was actually really useful. She chose to walk in on camera-less Raluca twice, Raluca chose to kill her for it. A reasonable choice; I gave about a 60% chance that Eleesha was mush myself. But she wasn't, just a player who didn't bother to read and who could hardly speak the language, even when highly motivated to. She wrote high quality and easily translatable French though, which helped me help translate for her and the rest of the crew trying to understand the brief war between Eleesha and Raluca. Protip: If the captain thinks both Eleesha and Raluca are human, the Captain is extremely unlikely to kill Raluca to save Eleesha. Who's going to fix Pilgred if that happens? Eleesha? Hah.</p><p>No, Eleesha what could have saved your life, and helped us all was instead of wandering the ship and throwing your AP away to catch nothing, you could have helped progress research. That might have gotten the myco scanner finished; that might have gotten Raluca to check for spores, see she had 0, and realize, 'Oh, whatever the bleep Eleesha was doing, it wasn't spiking me'. Would have been very useful in other ways too, but noooo. Ahh well, live foolishly, die foolishly. I hope you translate these words and consider the role your choices played in your fate.</p><p>Raluca... Oh my Raluca. Never had a 4 skills Raluca on a ship I played on before. You were our only technician and refused to dismantle a shower; no sofa for Paola or anyone because of that. But you did want to assemble all the blueprints you could; you did use the wrench to great effect with the scrap we were able to salvage early game, and you repaired somewhere close to 50 points of the hull! You also couldn't understand why we'd put a camera in Nexus for you, for all you wanted us to find the plasma shield so you could genius it; You spent over a day and a half outside of camera protection 'needlessly', that camera was there for you, you were informed, and absolutely no one idled in Nexus through cycle change, even without you being there, I was watching it and was ready to hurt people that did if necessary. It never happened - but you still preferred your turret.</p><p>Ahh Raluca, if only you'd told me about Eleesha walking in on you the first time; then I could probably have made sure there wouldn't be a second time, but no. You didn't bother to say a word until the second time. A bad time for me and the ship, low AP in general, problems looming all over the place. Still, you were an interesting and prickly player, even if you did 'blah blah blah' me, heh. And then try to poke holes in my 'laissez faire' style of Captaining through advice and recommendations, claiming my methods would kill the ship - when you were not following the majority of my suggestions either and it's not like I can make anyone do anything - I can try to kill someone, sure. How again does that help the ship? Cost me AP, costs the ship whatever good the player could do, and still doesn't get what I wanted done done. Sheesh, but my... I've never seen a hull more repaired than what you did. You've made me rethink my Pilgred progress theories too. Still thinking about them, but hrm... Early Pilgred might sometimes be worth the difficulties it causes, sometimes. Additionally, you were by far the most interesting personality on the ship to me, by sheer nature of the clarity and distinctness of your self-presentation.</p><p>Finola. Wow, Finola. The neatest thing you did, when it was almost all over, when you'd seen what was surely a spiking, where one player took down the camera, another walked out right before, walked in right after, then both players took off and Chun died moments later... you rose, showered, left the room, Ian died, you came back, showered again, laid back down. Wowsers. Bet those showers were satisfying, but the death of Ian in that room of fire you didn't even stop to report was surely more so. I'm sure Ian plagued you more than he did anyone else, what with his apron shenanigans. This ship must have driven you up the wall, sorry. I really didn't get to know you well, but I know you well enough to know that if you ever want me dead, I'm going to die. It might take you a lot of time, money, effort, and sweat/tears/blood, but you will not stop. Not even if the world is ending, no matter what happens to you or others because of your choices. Yikes! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Chun, interesting and dedicated player. Not able to be on 'much', but active enough for sure. Surely did at least half of the research that was accomplished, even without almost any access to the apron. I didn't get to know you well, you almost never spoke, but you did your job and did it fairly well under challenging circumstances. Thank you. The only thing I'm aware of that I wish you'd told me... someone!... about if you didn't trust me was the mycoalarm disappearance issue. Someone other than yourself took 4 of the 5 mycoalarms, and you never said a word. That was not an OK thing to have happen secretly, that's a really, really mushy thing, and knowing that had happened, and who took them, that would have changed the end game a bit. Might even have shortened it, but would have changed it. That is red-flag mush behavior, just so you know.</p><p>Paola. Wish I could have gotten you a sofa. You were not a native English speaker, which might have been why you almost never spoke, but you did pretty darn good with that comm terminal after I'm not sure what you did with your first dayish of AP. You did catch every rebel signal, got a little neron updates done, and got 2 Xylophs done. Not too terribly bad for a player who logged in mostly once a day and who had to commute from the dorms and didn't always get a bed. You did start talking to us a bit near the end of the game, and I wish I could have interacted with you more Thank you for your service to the ship.</p><p>Terrence. Never spoke at first, save for an initial Hello. Went idle for days, then came back, ate, and started to function, primarily in a turret whittling down some of the Aracks and Trax. Thanks for that - wish you'd been more with us. Your AP in the right places might have made this a very different game, but glad you shared the end with us.</p><p>Chao. Poor guy. Newbie Mush, spored in front of another player, maybe in a camera room at that. Promptly killed for it. Hope you keep playing, not all games are that short.</p>

                <p><em>Stephen</em>. Pretty cool player. Very laid back; not sure how you spent most of your AP. You might have enjoyed more direct instruction from me or anyone; you sure seemed happy and very quickly completed tasks whenever anyone asked you to do something. You were actually pretty high on my suspected mush lists, partially because of your 'how can I help/other times doing what?' attitude... but I think you're pretty new. You did pretty darn good! I really hope you keep playing. If you're not sure what to do, be a bit pushier, say something like 'I have 10 AP and am not sure how I should best use it right now, what do people recommend?'. You're not the only one who likes guidance and suggestion, and with information like that it's pretty easy to make good suggestions! Just remember, be a tiny bit suspicious of the requests made of you. Sometimes sneaky mush will trap you through your own helpfulness. That appears not to have happened at all this game though.</p><p><em>Janice</em>. Wow. You were a very quiet player with a lot of time restrictions, but you -really- did great with keeping our morale up. Morale was Not A Problem At All this trip, and it's all because of you. I worried sometimes about your morale, but we made it to ship death and you survived, so you must have managed yourself fairly well too. I felt very, very certain you were not Mush. And when we did that expo and you got lost on it? I was almost pacing in frustration and concern until I saw we got you back and you were alive and safe. You did everything asked of you, and worked tirelessly for a human win with all the time you could give the ship. You and Raluca are tied for Most Valuable Crew, but I like you best. Unlike Raluca, you didn't have sharp edges and prickly disagreements <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So... that leaves the Mush... ahh, the successful Mush. Which does, unfortunately include me. At least as of D7, C1. A second time that the mush have wanted me converted so badly that they gave up secrecy to convert me. I'm quite flattered! Deeply ashamed to be converted of course, but apparently you had to force the spores down my throat. So I'm not too shamed ;p</p><p><em>Roland</em> started off human. Newbie, curious, quite active, talkative... Of everyone in this game, Roland's my favorite, though I liked most of you, promise! My precious crew <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>So Roland took over the gardening, saved my precious Jumpkin, turned it into a plant for me, did this-that-the other thing at my behest, and generally seemed to learn a lot and enjoy a lot. Wow, was he super reluctant to go on the expo.</p><p>Roland had good instincts. He already had a spore at that point, as did I. And waiting alone in Icarus bay was Frieda, who had trapped us both once and who knew we were likely to come to the expo. She'd already decided that whomever got there first and picked up an item to get the second trap would get spiked. She'd been alone for 4 days at this point, quite honestly doing Astro work and getting genuinely bad results.</p><p>Roland, understanding at last that my invitation to go on the expo wasn't just being nice to a newbie who wanted to go - but actual genuine 'We need bodies in Icarus bay, hey anyone?', well. He went to IB, he got trapped, spored, and lucky me and Janice got to go on an Expo with 2 Mush. Amazingly, it was a highly successful Expo, we got an artifact, 4 alien steaks, 2 fruit(one was a jumpkin!), and 16 O2. Took no damage either - all we suffered was the loss of Janice, but with her safe recovery, all seemed very much well to me.</p><p>Roland and I talked a fair amount both before and after his conversion; Roland did a great job hiding his new species. I did suspect Roland when I started a casual 'who do you think is mush' conversation and got some stress-feel in his reactions, especially his praise of my instincts, but otherwise he felt totally clean to me. He, along with Janice, had my 'surely human' opinion. And really folks, given the overall levels of 'mushy play', well. I'm not going to cry 'kill it, it's mush!' over a twinge of oddness from a newbie who has consistently played very well.</p><p><em>Frieda</em>, well. Astro people just seem suspicious to me. Probably my inexperience in exactly how the terminal works, I have trouble telling how many sectors that their scans reveal and thus find it hard to gauge their AP usage. Also there's that Scan and throw away claim, that a human player used on me once to account for -days- of having no AP. That she was scanning planets but junking them without analysis because they were too big to be worth analyzing. Another French player who had trouble with English, and great outrage when we slew her for her probable mushiness. Oh well, she was human but still... so I don't trust Astro folk, I just don't.</p><p>And Frieda had bad luck, genuinely; all her planets were airless hulks. Didn't help my trust levels, but I had plenty else that looked far mushier. After the expo, when Hua was inactive, Frieda bought gold! Frieda became a Pilot! I was no longer the only active pilot! Frieda was doing a lot to help the ship! My trust of Frieda grew. And kept growing. Sure, a bit before D7 she mentioned searching the medilab, looking for the apron that huh? Why would anyone think Ian hid, he's been carrying it around, occasionally dropping it and appearing to forget it? But hide? Nah. I didn't even know about the mycoalarm issue, no one who knew about it saw fit to tell me.</p><p>That's where the one mush alarm was that she didn't know where was; Frieda had hidden the others in a location of her pleasing. Frieda was a very, very survival focused mush player; she wanted to live to the end of the ship and she wanted to be undetected. She did great, until she decided to come out of hiding D7 C1. Part of that was my talk, -just talk- about the possible support of the crew for human testing, with the numbers of fruit we might soon have, the coffee every cycle we might soon have, and how we might need to press for the cure and return to sol to survive. Amusing to me - as no one on the ship said 'yes! I will participate in Human testing and I want everyone else active on the ship to do so as well!'... or any other level of agreement; -both- of my attempts to start conversation on the subject were met by utter and complete silence.... none the less, the ship's 2 mush, just 2 among 12 living players as D6 drew to a close, were getting panicked at the idea. So they acted; both sporing me at the start of D7.</p><p>So I got to stop stressing over the impending death of my ship, and got to relax and enjoy it; suddenly everything that had been falling apart was falling into place. Both the day's spores had been used; I started my mush career on a ship with 7 hunters outside, one an Arack and another an asteroid and the hull only at 12%; both active pilots mush, and most players very, very low AP. Including me; I had 1 AP and 2 moves at that point; having been unable to get a bed that cycle change.</p><p>I got to enjoy reading the mush chat, where they had spent the last day discussing in detail my movements, my choices, my suggestions, when/where/how to catch me for spiking, if they perhaps had to kill me instead; makes a player get the warm fuzzies to be so hunted and feel so important! And to read stuff like this: "Frieda : I had to burn my spore going out to save the ship." Now that is praise for a captain - even the Mush were doing their part to keep the ship alive, and it was in part because of my play and how that affected their plans!</p><p>Oh, and about me? I was <em>Jin Su</em>, a captain almost always piloting or sleeping or eating; I got dirty and stayed dirty, though when I needed AP and moves badly enough I ate a pill and ate a ration on camera and discussed that I had, inviting people who might be concerned to read the log, and asked them to report and verify the log was there. I tried to play 'hop skip jump' with the ship to reduce the hunter swarms, until too many Trax + having been turned to Mush made that a most unappealing fuel investment.</p><p>I talked a lot, perhaps too much; maybe even way, way way too much; I sent a few missions, including one to myself at a nearly urgent time that utterly bugged out so didn't help anyone at all; I mentored and debated and suggested; presented evidence, discussed cost/benefit analyses, and deeply enjoyed my first experience with being Captain, being Jin Su, being a pilot, and actually going on an Expo.</p><p>Thanks for the fun guys! I hope people fill in details I missed (long as this is, there are missed details, heh). Many of you were awesome.</p><p>This trip had 12 living players as of the very start of D7. That's my greatest pride and joy in this. 12! Living! And many of us working together, more and more and more. What a great crew. Thank you all!</p>

I didn't expect this game to be quite as fun as it is and I'm glad I got my first voyage with such fun people! In regards to you talking too much, you didn't - Communication and interaction is part of the game and you were easily my favourite crew mate.

                <p>This was my first playthrough of Mush. I didn't want to snatch up an important role like pilot for my first time, so Stephen the cook appealed to me. I spent the first few turns trying to get a feel for the game, learning as I went along. I made some serious newbie errors, like wasting time cooking and then having to refreeze rations, but I had fun and learned much. Thanks to everyone for a great learning experience, especially Jin Su. You were an outstanding commander/teacher. I'm definitely going to keep playing.</p>

                <p>Frieda here. I was the Alpha mush, and it was quite the experience trying to maneuver about a ship with 5 cameras, an active Jin, and a very, very unfortunate demise of the other Alpha Mush. If not for our favorite game of 'Ian, drop the Apron!' I think this all would have gone much, much differently.</p><p>Jin/Impet asked me to do a retrospective on individual players as well, so... here goes.</p><p><strong>Chao</strong>. Oh Chao, I know this was your first time playing as a Mush. I would have been more than happy to help you get your bearings, give you advice like 'don't use the soap when you shower' etc, but I didn't figure I would need to tell you to look at the description of your action and see that extracting a spore in the presence of others was visible! And then you Spike Ian, and then you died after someone notices in the log that you extracted a spore. *sigh* Then again, I think you drove Ian crazy with that spore because...</p><p><strong>Ian</strong> Oh Ian, the Mush probably wouldn't have been victorious without you. Driven mad by the spiking, you rushed about the ship carrying the apron like a security blanket, and despite being punched, stabbed and told forcibly to drop it, you did nothing of the sort. The fact that, instead of killing the obvious Mush at the end of the game, Finola went after you and killed you in the middle of the burning Alpha dorm, the apron falling, finally, from your cold and dead fingers, demonstrates how much of an impact you had.</p><p><strong>Finola (and Chun)</strong> Great players, both. I felt sorry for you guys. Our ship was actually working fairly well, except for the fact that the apron was missing which meant that Research proceeded at a very, very slow pace. Mushy-me lived in constant fear that you would finish some other advance and put an even more serious damper on my efforts. Thanks for letting me take 4 of the 5 mycoalarms, though. Finola, I think my favorite moment of the game was your final vindictive stabbing of Ian, leaving Hua the only person left in the burning dorm.</p><p><strong>Hua</strong> Oh Hua, I wish you had stayed active. I know that as Mush, you win even if you blow the ship up, but I'd rather keep the ship alive and convert humans to mush slowly than simply try to blow it up... that's less fun (its also part of the reason why I burned a spore to fly out and save us that one time). If you had been active, we could have kept the ship flying for longer. As it was, Raluca only could look at Jin Su flying by. The same goes for <strong>Terrence</strong> and <strong>Gioele</strong>, although the latter I am very annoyed at for ahving all those extra cameras!</p><p><strong>Raluca</strong> Your killing of Eleesha was a big surprise. Totally wasn't expecting it, but it was nice to have happen. I'm still not sure why you didn't tear down one of the showers for people, nor why you didn't stay in a protected room... you were next on Roland and my conversion list.</p><p><strong>Roland</strong> Great game, Roland! You did an amazing job both as a human and as a Mush. Keep it up! The same goes for <strong>Stephen</strong> and <strong>Paola</strong> (although only as humans)</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> Sorry you had to die. Seemed like you were doing your job.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> You were an amazing commander, very on top of things, but stymied by a team that seemed flummoxed by how to do research. I doubt we would have made it even half as far without you. This was the first ship I'd been on that anyone had even floated the idea of 'Human Testing' and it scared the living daylights out of me. I felt the clock was on to convert you and make you STOP TALKING about it before, well... I got found out. Roland and I had planned to lure you to the bridge, but eventually decided just to be brazen and do it because we thought the game was over that cycle. It wasn't... nor the cycle after that, which was a little... awkward, but things worked out in the end.</p><p>And finally, <strong> Kuan Ti</strong> I'm sorry we had to kill you, but you did a great job drawing attention away from me.</p><p>Oh, and I had the apron at the end.</p>

                <p>This current game I'm in is in pretty bad shape. We're down to 5 living players... and none of the Mush were active. I'm currently out of AP in a ship as our last pilot, trying to fight off the enemy while the remaining crew struggles to advance and complete PILGRED... I think I'm going to have to do the noble sacrifice thing shortly.</p>
