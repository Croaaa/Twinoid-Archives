                <p>Derek here! Awesome crew and great ship! Everyone did their jobs well.</p><p>To the Mush, you guys may have failed but I respect that every one of you did try. Your first thought wasn't to go inactive or quickly pick out a target to kill, you actually put thought and even ended up converting someone. It was just bad luck that I caught onto that person quickly. Hell, I trusted Stephen quite a bit that's why it took me longer to actually tighten the noose. I'm glad I was right, though. Raluca was my other suspect and for good reason. Once we got mycoscanner up she had 3 spores! Good thing people worked on the research that requires 4 spores.</p><p>As for Gioele and Roland: Gioele jumped us away from a planet we had yet to explore immediately after gaining the commander title then failed to explain why. I had to kill him. Roland was just inactive cleanup when I wasn't yet comfortable with killing Stephen.</p><p>I was a little sad about not being able to get the Retro-Fungal Serum up but I guess we did our best. Thank you everyone for making it a fun experience, I hope your guys' next ships will be good, too. =D</p><p>(Also I told you I'd have you, Eleesha)</p><p>Edit: Also we lost Raluca. I felt horribly responsible for her death. The three cycles I sleep and she gets 3 panic attacks. I literally woke up and got on the cycle she died. If only I woke up 10 minutes earlier. =( Sorry Ral.</p>

                <p>Hello, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/stephen.png" alt=":mush_stephen_50:" class="tid_ico"> here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>That was a fine ship, I wish I could do better. Unfortunately for me, I had a real connection problems, therefore I missed few great opportunities to be more active in the mush-crew race. My first partner was Jin Su, but he become a suspect really quickly and got killed by Derek. Gioele was a real crew savior, taking you away from the planet with crystallite. It would be easy for mush traitor to spore all other members of the expedition in mush trap. Well, I had to try to get a new partner. Kuan Ti had a bad luck in being quite active in the Nexus, 2 traps and meeting in rear corridor and I wasn't alone anymore. Unfortunately, even before he managed to spore anyone, he got killed by Derek. <br>Anyway, that was the point where my problems with connection started to be a real burden. I could try to trap everything I could, but I wasn't able to turn anyone without making it obvious for the rest of the crew. When Eleesha and Raluca had 2 spores each, I decided to turn one of them, but when I managed to log to the game again, I was no longer alive. I hoped for some of my traps to work, there was a chance that some of you will be turned, but obviously it did not work as expected. Kudoz to Derek, I guess you were the person the rest of the crew should thank <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Great experience, next time it won't be so easy <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>You did great, Yosemite. I appreciate MUSH who actually make an effort. If it had been you who had taken anonymush and not Kuan Ti it would've been more difficult for me... Well until Eleesha had checked the list and realized it was printable. You were instantly my top suspect as your movements were completely in synch with Kuan Ti and Raluca was my other suspect (but she had 3 spores by the time you died so for good reason). Luckily we had mushovore bacteria. Also I caught your lie with the morale. Whenever you grab gold in the middle of the ship you instantly get +2 morale but it was a good attempt saying that you got it in the middle. I was actually fooled until I investigated it a bit further. Good thing I didn't accept that ration when I was making a move to kill Jin. You were smart but I expected as much. Thanks for making me sad for having to kill you, jerk. =( I trusted you first. As for your traps, nah, you didn't get anyone. I had Chun go around to the popular areas. She had 5 spores on her when she checked the mycoscan so good thing I did. It was great playing with ya, bud.</p>
