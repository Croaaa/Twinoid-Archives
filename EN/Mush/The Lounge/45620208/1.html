We mushes did successfully convert every valuable human or killed everyone else. And...Neron ejected us 7 living mushes into space. We took care of every human, but who would have thought that the AI would betray us????</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hunter.png" alt=":mush_hunter:" class="tid_ico">Just in time. We got at daychange a wave of 22 hunters and our plasma shield was already broken.</p><p>well, Neron is the true winner, it will probably even find a way to escape from the hunters or show them our dead bodies.</p><p>Our lovely mush story began with <br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> myself, Lvl 4 <strong>Chao</strong> and mush lvl 11</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> Lvl 4 <strong>Jin</strong> and mush lvl 14</p><p>Mush selection was at one point day 2 and we already had a great start!</p><p>Jin was awake right after cycle change and he did something very useful: He hid the mush sample!<br>I knew they would search for it, so when I was awake I could take the sample and erase the log afterwards.<br>Yes, it was in Front storage, Chun, I still don't know how you knew that someone took the sample from here when you checked the storage 2 days later xD</p><p>So we didn't have to worry mush research.</p><p>But Gio took paranoid and so cameras were in all dorms, lab, bridge and we thought! also in nexus.<br>Actually it seems noone did install the last camera, but we noticed it not that soon.</p><p>The humans mostly hang around in dorms, so we went for the inactive Raluca in CC<br>so day 2: <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> inactive Raluca mush created.</p><p>The humans noticed that someone hid the sample or is holding onto it. They searched for it in every room, but noone noticed something suspicious.</p><p>One day passed where we sneakily extracted some spores again. I took phagocyte this time to cover some shower damage and get more aps, I think especially in the end of our game it was useful ^^.<br>Fun fact: Jin had no splashproof and got hurt from picking up the soap, so he was already down to <strong>2 hp </strong><img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Well, we combined healing him sneakily and converting the active and gold Finola, who did already worked hard on mycoscan <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> day 3: Finola converted.<br>Unfortunately Finola was very quiet after conversion, I dunno why, but she didn't help with a mushy action till the end, she was to afraid to get dirty even once and stayed therefore somehow inactive.<br>Also she took anonymush unfortunately some hours after Jin took it already, the humans noticed it and wondered, why mushes are doing something like that. We too ^^.</p><p>So at this point we had no possibility anymore for a conversion with combination that someone is taking anonymush. Our best bet was therefore to get someone around the time when that person is active.<br>The next day, we were lucky with Hua. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>Hua was the only Technician and she worked at plasma shield. While pretending to relay her, I could get her in nexus (we noticed only shortly before that incident that there is no camera in nexus ^^). Then Jin did double-spike her!<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">day 4: active Hua!</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> At day 5 we were pretty low on oxygen and since our Frieda was inactive, we didn't had good planets. Gioele read astro mage book but found no oxygen planet too. Fortunately Janice found finally an oxygen planet, but it was a dangerous one! It had oxygen, high temps, desert*2, crystalite, some other zones I don't remember and... a <strong>volcanoe</strong>!</p><p>Our goal was of course full conversion and so we wanted to help the humans and maybe convert one of them at the expedition. <br>The most active mushes: Hua, Jin and myself, we all joined the expedition in the end and only one human joined: Paola.<br>I already imagined we would just die on the volcanoe, think about that imagination: 3-4 mushes dead on instantly, the humans would just laugh at us xD</p><p>But we were lucky, really lucky! We got 24 oxygen, one starmap fragment (unfortunately no mush trap <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">) and volcanoe did abandon the expedition earlier then expected, so we got the oxygen before day change and therefore before oxygen would hit zero! <br>We saved the humans and us with that action.<br>Then Hua, Jin and myself did spike Paola.<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> day 5: sometimes active Paola.<br>But Paola did also no mushy action till the end (unfortunately she did even shower her to death at day 7 cycle 1 o.o ).<br>But another conversion seems good, right? well... A dangerous human showed up: Terrence! He did notice the exact time of conversion and entered IB to look what happened (I was able to spike him at that short moment of his visit <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico">) and he returned to dorm. I assumed he would accumulate ap to kill one of us.</p><p>With the active Hua, we already planned to convert Terrence and maybe Janice a short time later if he and Paola would help spiking her. We planned it at c1, Hua wasn't active then at the time we wanted to act and we had to wait a bit longer.<br>At end of cycle 4 it happened finally, we got Terrence and I took the camera in the defaced room. <br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> day 6: active and dangerous Terrence<br>But Terrence wasn't active before Janice. That was a problem, because Janice noticed the conversion and concluded Hua entering and leaving the room. So she killed single - handedly Hua and slept in Bdorm afterwards.<br>Very unfortunate since Terrence was a high-level mush, who could have converted Janice alone with help of Jin.<br>And humans were on alert now, but since everyone of us (Terrence, Jin, myself) tried to act a bit human, they couldn't decide to kill one of us.</p><p>Now we planned to rule the ship by infecting Janice and maybe stephen at day change, maybe even a third conversion with help of Finola/Paola.<br>But Terrence lost his internet connection just at the time of acting <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Jin and myself had to change plans..it got more bloody.<br>We converted Janice, killed Chun, Stephen and Ian, I infected one time Gio and now only Gioele with one spore and Eleesha was left as only human.<br>Janice was instantly very willing to help and with phagocyte she hurt Eleesha a bit. <br>Luckily around 1 hour later Terrence got his connection back, infected Gioele and helped killing Eleesha.<br>And that was our mush win! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>When Gio came active a while later he complained that there was nothing left to do for him ^^.<br>And shortly later Neron's assassination happened (see the story at the beginning).<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> day 7: bloody Janice<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> day 7: poor Gioele</p><p>Thx to everyone, it was a fun game! Also the humans were very nice people. Don't feel bad now, Chun, you were cute!</p>

                <p>Troublesome Janice here. I'd like to point out that I had actually gone offline within 10 minutes of you guys clearing the log, and didn't come back until 15 minutes after cycle change.</p><p>At that point all I did was check who had entered Alpha Bay/Rear Corridor over those 30 minutes I was gone. Hua was the only one. Sorry Hua. I just knew there were a few mush already at that point and I had to take the low hanging fruit.</p><p>But I hadn't suspected Chao, Terrence, or Jin Su until that incident. And even then I don't think I'd have guessed all three of you were mush after that. That was extremely impressive, you two.</p>
