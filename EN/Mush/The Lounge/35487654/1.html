We were a little disorganized at first with a few new people (who picked things up "quick smart" ), no real leader, and some early miscommunications on NERON and research, but pulled together well after the mush were gone. We probably could have pushed further but had no starmaps, no Jin Su or Janice, shield punctured, and some people going rough on HP and morale. Everyone who responded was ready to return.</p><p>Stephen and Ian were the alpha mush, and they were good about never doing anything definitively mushy. However, they both made the same huge mistake: cuddling the cat a couple of days in without any explanation. Ian was already suspect due to his staying dirty from D2C8 all the way through the next day (sleeping for most of it) and into D4. I'm still not sure if he ever washed. Stephen always in a bed or coming and going from Bravo Dorm, and never reported meaningful AP use despite being medium talkative on the public channel. That bed was under the gaze of Janice, so when he'd had many cycles in a row of that and then randomly picked up the cat, the case was pretty much closed. Roland, Hua, and I had been on a channel to coordinate hunters vs. scrap collection (sorry about not inviting you to pilot club, Frieda, we figured scanning was your full time job!) and that became a sort of mush hunting channel.</p><p>In retrospect the pill test that we forced on Stephen was a bad idea. We already knew he was mush. I was ready to kill based on what we had, and I'm pretty sure Hua and Roland were in the same boat. So the test was really only going to give us justification we could take to the rest of the crew in the remote case we were wrong. Also, I noted at the time that if I had been Stephen, I would have refused to touch any of it on the grounds that something brought to me might be infected. If he'd done that we would have been worse off than when we started: knowing he's mush but still without the proof we were looking for, and now with a cornered and more dangerous enemy. Anyway, it backfired. Stephen ran off to Medlab, finished the conversion of Finola in front of a camera, stole and I assume hid the Medkit (we never found that damn Medkit!) came back to Bravo Dorm and ate our only Jumpkin, and stole the soap before running off. I was the first after him with the knife and promptly pooped my pants, tearing my tongue on the first stab. So much for Terrence being an ex-soldier. It was agonizing being unable to talk or even read the public channel during the climax.</p><p>Roland finished off Stephen and then retraced his steps to the Medlab, where he saw Stephen's spike on Finola logged by the camera. Ian and Gioele were also present there. I had been unsure about Ian up until then (Roland and Hua seemed much more certain) but once we knew that Finola was the new mush, it was obvious that Ian must have spiked her once or twice in the Lab where there was no camera. The whole crew ganged up on Ian there in the Medlab and finally got him, and Finola followed shortly afterwards. So, while the romp by Stephen was definitely damaging, it could have been much worse if he'd removed the Medlab camera first. If we hadn't known who he'd spiked, we could reasonably have believed that Gioele was beta or even Ian beta, with a different alpha running around elsewhere.</p><p>After the mush were gone it was surprisingly smooth sailing, with the one exception of losing Raluca. I'm still upset about that. Raluca was a fantastic crew member and I have no doubt we would have made it at least a couple of days further with her. She died in a Seismic zone on a last-ditch O2 expedition around Day 6.</p><p>Really loved the actives on this crew, with good humor all around and a really good vibe. Thanks for the fun times in Alpha Dorm, Paola. Also, this feels a little cheap because I put it together one cycle before the end, but two sofas is two sofas. I rode that second couch all the way back to Sol.</p>
