                <p><strong>Ian</strong> here.</p><p>Alright our travel has just ended, this wasn't an exceptional one, but the ending was totally worth it.</p><p>So here is a short version of what happened:</p><p><span class="tid_strike"></span>-<br>The game started around halfway through day 2 with mush selection.</p><p>The neron team started with its problems early, doing research on several projects at the same time, differences on what project to advance and so on.<br>Research on the other hand started normally and we developed the first research fast enough.</p><p>I took care of the plants and dropped every ap i could onto antimush projects. We developed mycoscan pretty fast too and i could test me.. i was infected with 1<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">.<br>Pretty soon we had our first confirmed human (raluca) and a once we had done spore sucker the second one (me, first time i actually use that ugly an painful thing). <br>Given that the knife and grenade was on the dorms (and our chun was pretty inactive) i grabbed them to avoid the usual massacre by bored mushes <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> <br>By now *Kuant ti* was idle.</p><p>Anyways plants kept growing (quite slowly) the ship resisted but we had no mush attacks besides a few suspicious moves (like jin an eleesha together in RC before cycle change).</p><p>Our o2 has slowly going down and <strong>frieda</strong> eventually found a nice and cozy planet for us to refill it.<br>Given that we had several zones with chances of getting fruits i went to icarus to give a hand.</p><p>It was night and i went to sleep.</p><p>When i woke up the worst had happened. The mush attacked and quite hard.<br>Jin moved us away (Twice) consuming all our fuel. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Hua</strong> immediately counterattacked and killed jin. <em>A third Mush appeared on the bar</em> we had an annonymush.</p><p>I inmediatly went to the engines and saw that <strong>eleesha</strong> loaded the fuel and jin moved the ship twice as we slept (kudos to them that hurted us badly).</p><p><strong>Andie</strong> who was only showed her what happens when you are supposed to hunt mushes and you became one of them <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico">. Eleesha was now dead.</p><p>The problem was who was the third one.</p><p>Standing on RBS (where both eleesha and jin) did their evil acts was raluca, who between the time she was confirmed and this moment had several encounters with them (you have to stay more protected raluca).</p><p>Its seamed the logical choice, they would had infiltrated our human chat.<br>And Gio took care of her.</p><p>Unfortunately she was human <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We now had to find the last mush, find a planet and get fuel to go there.</p><p>Before dying apparently eleesha had fun moving stuff around, and so we began searching for stuff. <br>At one moment <strong>Janice</strong> found a hidden coffee on AB2 and this fired our brains.</p><p>We managed to track every single coffee and who had it and it was the one <strong>Roland</strong> took at D4 (it was now D5) so logically we wanted to kill him <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Unfortunately (and for several of us) Gio doubted <strong>Terry</strong>. Poor terry not only was on a wheelchair and nobody gave him a bed, but also got that big <strong>Gioele</strong> hitting him (for suspected mush).</p><p>I tried to convince him that it was roland before i went to sleep once again.</p><p>I woke up once again... and as usual mushes did their thing as i sleep <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"><br>Roland took our 2 extinguishers boarded the Pasiphae and left the Daedalus. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We managed to build a 3rd one from a blueprint but now we couldnt collect fuel nor move the ship. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/mad.png" alt="X[" class="tid_ico"></p><p>and so our race began, <strong>o2</strong> was going down only stopped by an occasional help of oxy ducts and plants at day change.<br>We got attacked by hunters which we decided to let attack us hoping that they will hit the pasiphae destroying it.</p><p>We killed raluca, terry (our tech) and kuan was idle... pilgred was at 27%.</p><p>Then something unexpected happened... Kuan came back to life <img src="../../../../gfx/square/surprised.png" alt="8D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We started working on pilgred mostly by kuan and the rest relaying.</p><p>We finished pilgred and <strong>o2</strong> was almost at 0.<br>We guarded AB2 to avoid roland from entering the ship and taking us back and we hoped for the best.</p><p>It didnt worked... pasiphae was at 2hp but we had our first dead by lack of <strong>o2</strong><br>After all his work Kuan died (<img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>The hull was extremely low and we had to take the hunters down.</p><p>A new game started and one by one we began drawing sticks each cycle someone dies... 10 humans vs 1 mush... the odds were incredible bad for us and each cycle humanity became weaker...</p><p>We tried everything, even to collide the pasiphae by turning the daedalus around, it didnt worked. (anyone knows if this is even possible?)</p><p>After kuan, stephen died, chun (who was now inactive), Janice, Derek, Paola, one by one we went down and roland sat on the pasiphae waiting.</p><p>we were arriving day 8, we were only 5 vs 1 mush left.<br>Our idea was to grab each 1 o2 (that we will receive from plants) to try to get roland dead.</p><p>We didnt did this before mostly because we hadnt enough o2 for everyone, so we all agreed to leave it by luck. It wasnt nice saying bye to a member each cycle.</p><p>At day 7 cycle 7 I felt it was my turn... I made a thread saying goodbye to my lovely plants and asking someone to take care of them (its true) went to eat waiting for the worst (i had been lucky until now).</p><p>Either <strong>Gio, Andie, Frieda, Hua, Roland or me</strong> was going to die.</p><p>As soon as i came back i logged in and found the blue screen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico">... Roland had died and gio took us home <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Humanity won <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
