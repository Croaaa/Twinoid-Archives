On that ship, we had an Inactive skinned Jin Su, a braindead golden Terrence, afk Raluca, meaning no Pilgred, 1 pilot, and overall maybe 7 active people.<br>I was the leader on it, doing all the managing, what to do, who to suspect, anti mush groups, relaying everything, going on an expo, establishing connection twice, EVERYTHING that is possible to do.<br>Same goes for the active ones, Eleesha, Chao, Hua, Janice, and to a lesser degree, Chun, Finola. They all did their jobs the best they could, making the ship go this far at least.<br> <br>We quickly found out Frieda when she simply gave up after the grande/attacks failed.</p><p>Stephen, you have done <strong>NOTHING</strong>. Now this may be a valid mush strategy, but to further explain the situation: You didn't communicate, failed to turn anyone with 2 people idling on the front corridor and turrets. You idled in the refectory, where it seems you trapped stuff, probably me once, without even making the slightest risk.<br><em>FOR MUSH'S SAKE YOU DIDN'T EVEN TAKE YOUR SINGLE SKILL.</em> The only reason we didn't kill you the last two days was that there was such a rampang inactivity that we had no AP left to spare to practice killing.</p><p>Everyone else, I salute you. Stephen, I would report you for that message if I could. Hope you read this and react.</p><br><br><p>...I know I'm bitter because I put much effort into this ship, only to see a *insert negative words here* say that.<br>I'm open for everyone's opinion about this, ship or non ship players.

                <p>The ship lasted about 4 days. We just didn't have enough info, as the mush could have been easily any of the inactive people since they didn't starved to death yet. Eleesha'S list printed 4 possible candidates, 3 of them were already under suspicion:<br><strong>Chao,</strong> for not answering some questions, getting dirty and moved around without mention, but he was low on the list (for me).<br><strong>Janice</strong> was the other, active, doing her job but not much else, moved around to refrsh inventory threads. Nice idea to trap/spore, and apart from that she didn't got into the discussions on the main page.<br><strong>Kuan Ti</strong>, who was active..sometimes. Silent, I don't think I saw him communicate once. Moved a little, bumped the Neron Project, but not enough to feel like he was impactful. I have to wonder if it was because he had bad % and never asked for relays. For me, he was the the most likely one, showing signs of activity, having some cover for movement, yet barely talking. (It was the same with Janice, but from the outside she helped each time she could, so probably not her.)<br>And then, 4th was <strong>Stephen</strong>. No movement, when I checked he moved out of the refectory once in 2 days, <em>no skills but dirty</em>, meaning possible<em> transfer</em> into someone else (it was the day 5 people ate rations, so hard to pinpoint who).</p><br><p>Personally, I don't like going around killing before I have at least a little bit of evidence against someone, apart from the "well he's on the list and acting weird." By that rule, we would have killed all 4, and the ship died on day 3 or so as I wouldn't have repaired engine, Chao moved, Hua shot down, etc.</p><p>Edit: Sperbi: I organised the ship were people barely acted as a team, hence my reasoning. I wouldn't say that I was the best, since I didn't have pilot or technician to actually do the things that mattered, like hunters or pilgred. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Heya GT, I see your ships have been about as interesting as mine these past few ships. Personally, I don't like to wait for hunger to kill the inactives. It might save you AP but you're giving the mush plenty of time to utilize their presence. A sneaky Finola on my last ship rode back to Sol with us because she converted an inactive that we killed. I wouldn't go about killing people on a list to trim it down, but if someone's not playing and they're in a position where they are harmful to you, I'd fully endorse the slaying of inactives if Janice is around to offset morale loss.<br>Anyways, hang in there. Soon we'll be able to sell people like Stephen to slave traders for goodies! Hope to fly with you again soon.</p>
