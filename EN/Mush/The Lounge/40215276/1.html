Firstly Ian and Hua where the mushes and pretty much outed themselves right away, with Ian taking out Janice, and Hua giving in (I am guessing she was newish) and outing herself privately to Paola, only for Derek to pop her in the head before Paola managed to tell the crew. Mush where dead pretty early on and by about day 8 we had pretty much weeded out all the Inactives to leave us a crew of 10. We had Pilots, Astronavs, Techs, a Polyvalent, a hopped up Caffeine Junkie, and we even managed to get Chun Medic. The only thing we where missing was moral boosting skills, and much to my (Terrence) disme i found that a huge hindrance. I think we could have made it to Eden if only we hadn't lost those four hydropots in the fire, it would have been perfect if we had a full 10 plants instead of 6. Otherwise we managed two out of three map pieces and finally on day 16 came to a decision, Jump to a O2 planet and leave behind a cristiline zone we had found (We where on 12 O2 and losing it fast from tank breakages), or try for our last map piece in a cristiline zone right next to an active volcano. We took the coin flip on the map piece and it came up tails unfortunately so at that point we decided we had enough and made our way back to sol.</p><p>I think that covers the story kinda, if I missed anything I will add it later.</p><p>So a few things, Geoele and Andie where both machines in getting things done, as well as their RP was pretty good too. I kinda feel bad for Reluca because we didn't manage to get her a second couch, and so she never really got to be as efficient as she could have been. The crew without jobs where generally useful, Paola, Stephen, Derek. I think we dealt with most crises situations handily (mostly), and we in general had a pretty good crew. Still it is sad we didn't manage Eden, but there is always next time.</p><p>Anyway for the moment this is Terrence, signing off. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Ah, I was hoping someone would make an AP thread for this! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico"> here! So sorry we couldn't manage Eden this voyage, RNG was against us in the end. If Stephen didn't manage to get killed I think we could have managed farther, but at that point there was no reason to move on. It was sad having to return to Sol with 2 starmap fragments.</p><p><strong>Andie</strong> - Oh wait, that's that lame jerk that can't play mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Derek</strong> - Hero of the SDF! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"> You got around and did your job admirably. Repairing things with your tech book, killing Hua, and just in general helping the crew. Good to have you on board with us! <em>Just a note: getting dirty and hugging the cat, while it was suspicious, was kind of a weak reason to kill Hua, unless you were told what evidence we had on her.</em> Also, not sure if you found out, but we kind of stuck the cure into you, since it seems RNG was blessing you with no morale issues at all, still surprised you never once had to dtt.</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> - What happened? You seemed like a really active person before mush selection, but you kind of disappeared. I'm assuming RL came in and kept you from mush.</p><p><strong>Frieda</strong> - So sad to lose you so early. You did your job and scanned the planets. It was a shame that you had to go out that way. I guess it was a combination of random damage and a brief bout of starvation that did you in.</p><p><strong>Gioele</strong> - My love! I have to say, RPing with you was immensely fun, and despite all the weirdness in the beginning, I think the characters we created worked perfectly together, and it was really nice to have someone on board that pretty much had the same mindset as myself as far as healing, planets, hunters, and pretty much every decision went. So nice to have someone so invested in RP as you. Oh, and sorry again about getting Raluca pregnant with your child, and letting your daughter have her way with me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> <em>Also, you said some of the sweetest things I think I've ever heard in mush to date. </em></p><p><strong>Ian</strong> - You tried to mush up the place I guess. Not sure what went on between you and Hua, but I guess given Hua's actions you were kind of alone. If you didn't go after Janice though, you were certainly not high on the suspect list. That was the fastest I've seen research go this season, so thanks for that! Too bad we lost those pots you gave us though, and your actions made keeping morale a huge pain. But at least you made an effort.</p><p><strong>Janice</strong> - So sorry we lost you. You would have been amazing to have on the crew, and we could have gone a lot longer if you were kept alive. You were good to have while you were around though, but you were missed dearly.</p><p><strong>Hua</strong> - Not going to say much. You had a lot of opportunity to do things, but you failed to even infect the cat! Heck, Jin Su was suspicious enough, you could have let him take the hit. You could also have worked alongside Ian to rampage and kill more actives, not that it would have won you the game most likely, but you could have gotten lucky. If you were completely new to mush, I'd let it slide, but you obviously knew about the cure, and asked to be cured! <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_surprise.gif" alt=":O" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> - Sure, we butted heads quite frequently, and you made a LOT of mistakes, but I still would have rather had you live. I can't tell if you just quit or if RL came in the way, but we could have used you on the ship.</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> - You dirty little man you! I'm not subject to your charm like the other girls! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> It was fun to have you on the ship, and your RP was quite entertaining, and a bit more tasteful that Paola's sex hunt. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Regardless, you also were a valuable member of the crew, keeping an eye on things and helping repair what needed fixed.</p><p><strong>Paola</strong> - Sure, we had a our arguments, and I still think the idea of a planet scanning cult is ludicrous, but you still did your job well enough. You got us the rebel bases and upgrades we needed. And you were good about making sure to DTT, since that was really our main way to gain morale. And your RP was entertaining, if a bit off-putting. Never seen someone attempt a sex-crazed Paola before. It was interesting.</p><p><strong>Raluca</strong> - I'm so sorry I gave you Gioele's child! I really thought he would want a baby! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> Really wish you would have avoided entering dorms with people in them, but I guess it all worked out in the end. You were a good person to have on the ship, and it was fun to have you! Not to mention you, with the rest of the tech team, kept the ship in good condition. So many equipment breakages.</p><p><strong>Roland</strong> - So good to have such an enthusiastic member of the team on board! Not to mention you and Terrence did an amazing job taking on the hunters yourselves! Glad we got to be on a ship together! You did an outstanding job getting done what needed to be done, be it kill hunters or healing wounds. Sorry we never got to have you on an expedition. By the time we started doing them we needed to protect our pilots as much as possible. Maybe next ship! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Stephen</strong> - You didn't talk to much, but you generally got things done around the ship. Kind of fell inactive near the end, but I don't blame you. If you're not invested in the RP it gets hard to stick with the ship. Still, sorry your death was what got us to end the game. You managed to stick around so long, it was hard to lose another crew member.</p><p><strong>Terrence</strong> - I have to say, I loved having you on the ship! That Crabism hurt you quite a bit, but at least there were some entertaining lines about you "Running around, only exhaustion keeping you going" whenever the illness impacted you. Also, you were a magnet for panic attacks, I think you had 5 panic attacks in a matter of maybe 2 days at most. I guess the only good part about that was the simple fact that at least we knew you were the one we had to take care of. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> So glad we didn't lose you though, you were such a valuable member of the crew.</p><p><strong>Chun</strong> - You did your part, but I really wish you were a bit more active. That medic skill would have been amazing both for healing and for knocking out the last of the research. Also, would have liked notification we got the serum finished, or the soap for that matter. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> Still, good to have you around, any ideas who the father of your child is? I'm sure he would like to know. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>All in all, a good ship. Frustrating dealing with all the morale issues near the end, on top of the typical day10 + woes. Sitting there with 2 starmap fragments made going further tantalizing, and I know some of you really wanted to get an Eden ship under your belt, but after we lost Stephen that was pretty much it for us, no sense dragging it on. I'm still kind of relieved I didn't die in a volcano on that last expo, but the mush trap was a huge downer. Maybe those of you without an Eden voyage will get it next ship! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

We're still pretty much on the same wavelength.<span class="tid_sideNote">D'aw, stop it, you. Gioele just has his way with words when he wants to! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"></span></p><p>It was indeed sad that we lost Janice so early, but I think that also was a smart move from the Mush, seeing as she was our only stable source of morale. If it wouldn't make us die from depression, it would at least force us to pull back earlier. Which it almost made us do, but it was the pots that really did us in later. Not to mention that we became sort of stable once Andie got confident (creds to you for sacrificing lvl 11 Mush for that).</p><p>We should have realized that she would be a prime target, and focused on keeping her safe.</p><p>We had a stumbling start on this ship, specifically the Mush Phase. Eleesha was inactive since early D3, The Cult, and I am a bit upset at Jin Su's display on this ship. He seemed to have some experience from previous ships, but did least to say questionable decisions that made the hunt harder, since he caught our suspicion, just to then go inactive, starve and hand over the role as commander to me.</p><p>I'd actually been hoping for a Jin Su that doesn't die so that I could try out what it'd be like to not be Commander Gioele, but it always seems like I'm bound to have that role sooner rather than later once I pick him (and don't become Mush, because then <em>I'm</em> the one that won't last that long.).</p><p>Also, probably would have handed him gold so that he could get Leader if he stayed with us. Sure, Pilot is good, but we already had plenty. Oh well, it would make more sense if it was not an MMM ship, and I think he was one of the guys that joined hours before the MMM started and therefore wasn't ready for 70% of the crew being MMMers.</p><p>Anyways. <strong>On to the good stuff!</strong></p><p><strong>Andie!</strong> These 16 days in space wouldn't have been the same nor possible without you! You were super active and active the cycles I couldn't watch over the ship, you used your invaluable skillset well, and the RP was impeccable. I live for roleplaying, and this is some of the best I've had in Mush, only one other ship I've been to has been this into RP, and even then I didn't feel this invested.</p><p>This ship has been really entertaining for me since the RP was good, and people really got into it. <strong>Kuan-Ti</strong> was fun to argue with, <strong>Terrence</strong> was my friend in grumpiness that I pushed around the ship (and that was really depressed, holy crap did you catch many panic attacks. Think you took the majority of them), and <strong>Raluca</strong>... well. The roleplay there was sort of weird, to say the least. Gonna need to take a shower after whole Gioele and Raluca pregnancy, but at least we sort of handled it well. <strong>Paola's</strong> roleplay made me angry, as it should have. I think Gioele was considering to disown her after this incident in our timeline of the Mush world. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So in the end, we had a 55% chance of getting the last map piece, a 12% to lose Andie (Which would have broken Gioele's heart), but neither happened, both to one's disappointment and relief. At least we get to turn back home without anyone more dying.</p><p>All in all, it's been good. Even though we didn't reach Eden, this game's about the journey, not the destination, and the journey was really fun, even though it didn't lead where we wanted it to. Thanks everyone! Hope to see you in another ship in the future. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I think I am going to stave off the urge to play Terrence for a while and play someone with a simpler job. Being a tech and a pilot is a rather hectic skill combo. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I guess I did need a little bit of babysitting didn't I, I think the final panic attack count was 10 but luckily the subsided a bit towards the end. Man that Crabism/Canabalism was a nightmare to deal with too. It chewed through my MP like no mans buisness and left me using a lot of ap moving around, luckely i had the scooter, but still that sickness changed my plans so many times. I kinda wish i got in more on the RPing, but i guess my little holiday got in the way of that, shame. X.X</p>
