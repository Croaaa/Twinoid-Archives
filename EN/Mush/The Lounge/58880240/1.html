                <p>Janice here!</p><p>It was my first ship after more than 1 year without playing so I definitely felt very rusty and had to keep going back to mushpedia or Peanutz with my noob questions. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I thought it was a fun ship overall, we did quite a mess of the mush hunt and were terribly indecisive which allowed mush to do some good moves with a difficult combo of characters.

                <p>Mush Ian here. In theory it was an easy ship for mush with mush Chao and newbie Eleesha, unfortunately my partners weren't very experienced. Not that easy to be mush as Ian, when aggression is not an option and all infections cost you 3 ap. I was Fertile + Fungal kitchen, extracted 3 spores at the first day change and spored a ration in the Lab, masking it as moving plants to the garden. It was after Chao refused to convert Stephen who was hanging in the Lab without a camera, Chao said he doesn't want to be suspicious. He was bronze and took Slimetrap <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Paola ate the spored ration and told me that now she has to kill me, because i was your top suspect. And she as mush Comms officer announced in main chat that Pilgred merchant had arrived <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Kuan Ti wasn't highly inactive, but we could trade me from a storage room. Paola was only lvl 5 mush and couldn't transfer to Jin Su after trade, we waited for Chao to come online so we could kill Jin near the cycle end and move to Sol after Chao becomes our commander. But Chao wasn't online and Jin moved the ship.</p><p>Crew was going on expedition, people started gathering in Icarus. After some time i logged in and i saw Paola's messages, that she took Hacker Kit and is going to abandon the expo crew once they launch <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"> That would be a disaster <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> It would gave away she was a mush, it would kill Chao on expedition leaving only top suspect mush (me) on the ship. This plan was canceled and crew successfully returned from the expo. We asked Chao to kill Eleesha so people never have a chance to know if there is still mush (Paola) on board, but he refused to do it and went to help with projects and researches.</p><p>We had only 1 spore left to extract that day, i asked no one to do it, because i was planning to either convert Hua (like i did the next day) or spore another consumable, but Chao extracted it on cycle 8 and nothing mushy happened at the day change.</p><p>The next day i logged in and saw Paola had killed Chun. I really don't understand why this was necessary. Paola was highly trusted person, to win the ship mush team had to eliminate Eleesha and Paola could safely return to Sol with humans, but she decided to be active and rampaged without any discussion.</p><p>At the day change i extracted another 2 spores, visited Medlab, found hidden mycoalarm there and took it, uninstalled both cameras in the dorms and converted Hua in bravo dorm. I was hoping this would give maximum suspects with humans not knowing where conversion had taken place.</p><p>I told Chao to stay silent and to do nothing. I asked him that 4 or 5 times, because i knew at that time my partners love to take questionable initiatives <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Turned out that wasn't enough and when Jin came to alpha dorm to kill me Chao started attacking him (for 3 ap each time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">). And he was murdered immediately.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/tip.png" alt=":mush_tip:" class="tid_ico"> Tips for mush <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/tip.png" alt=":mush_tip:" class="tid_ico"><br>1. Don't do anything without discussing it with your partners, especially when you want to rampage.<br>2. If you decide to rampage ask yourself what the goal is. How many technicians still left, are there tech books, is Eleesha alive to print the list.<br>3. Don't kill your mush partners if it doesn't win you the game immediately.<br>4. Don't take Slimetrap <img src="../../../../gfx/square/mad.png" alt="X[" class="tid_ico"><br>5. Don't be afraid to be suspicious, you are a mush, this is your job to be suspicious. If you are just suspicious and humans have no direct proofs, it would usually take them quite a time to decide if they are ready to kill you. Humans always are a step behind.<br>6. If you are a mush and people think you are confirmed, don't unmask yourself, let your partners to do dirty job (kill Eleesha as minimal goal).</p>

                <p>Oh wow, that was quite a journey for the mush. I have to say that you did a great job with the cards you were dealt with, even if we were already suspecting you we would probably not kill you right away since it takes so much to kill mush Ian. I think we would probably have killed Stephen before any of you...</p><p>The fact that Paola was trusted was an incredible asset and too bad she decided to rampage because your plan of getting her to sol could have worked. Now looking back at some conversations I see that she had a few weird comments in the "human" chat but don't think it would be enough to make her suspicious. Specially because I hadn't realised that she had been converted so early, I was incredibly confused when she rampaged and was thinking that maybe a transfer had occurred. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p>
