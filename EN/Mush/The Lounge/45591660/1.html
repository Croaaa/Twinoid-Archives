                <p>Ciao cari amici, <br>this is <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7328">the End.</a></p><p>I'm not good at making AP threads and couldn't come up with a good name for this one so I'm borrowing Kuans Last Words. At first I wanted address it directly to the <em>lovely Ralulu</em> and <em>adorable Janice</em>, then I thought about using Janice comment about the "long boring survival" which was a short not so boring survival and then I wanted to use <strong>SHE SPOKE!</strong> as in <em>Hi Chun, wonderful to see you outside the research thread and thank you for hacking us home</em>. But now I'm just going with Kuans last words because Chao and Paola are neither dead nor mush.</p><p>Instead we are home and mushfree. Which I wasn't to sure about to be honest, because I still don't know how and when Hua gave Ralulu her 3rd spore.</p><p>We've had a <em>pilot problem</em> through out the whole journey. Roland wasn't very reliable and got inactive after a few days and Hua well I don't know if she wasn't active enough in total or if she acted as if because she was mush. But those two were all the pilots we had so we ended up flying out as non pilots most of the time.</p><p>We got our first dead mush on day 3 cycle 1 because <em>Stephen wasn't very stealthily about visiting Ralulu twice over day change and taking Anonymus</em>h didn't help with that. If he took it to make us believe Ralulu was converted and they just both took Anonymush he succeeded. But our Ralulu was just to cute (and we were to short on AP) to be killed right away and very willing to do anything possible to prove herself human. I have no idea if she did do a food test in the end but the whole talking and accidentally eating the ration first (two newbies giving each other tips apparently doesn't work) and blaaaaaa made it pretty clear that she was still one of us.</p><p>The research team was pretty fast and we had mushovore by the end of the day but when we got the scanner Ralulu already got her 3rd spore. As I said, I still don't know how. I strongly suspected Kuan for building the Oscilloscope right there in AB2 before Ralulu came to go scrapping as she said she would and Terrence who for whatever reason visited her in ER afterwards. We of course send her to stay under a camera until the spore sucker was done and we could free her from those nasty spores - but I guess we really were to open about knowing her spore status and should have used a PN or so to organize the spore sucker research.</p><p>It came as it came, <em>Hua converted Ralulu</em> exposing herself in the process <strong>but</strong> at the same time <em>Chao</em> who had been on the bridge for quite a while dropped a blaster to <em>take the camera down for... a bit of privacy</em>. So <em>Kuan</em> who came in probably to re-establish the Sol connection <em>saw Chao taking down the camera + a new mush and came to the natural but wrong conclusion</em> that I was converted by Chao, picked up the Blaster and shot at Chao who in turn begin Chao and well being attacked, shot back (boy don't keep BOTH blasters there are more shooters in the house..) and killed Kuan. Really bad timing. I woke up with a spleen to Chao having murdered Kuan and Ralulu being converted. So I went down, ignoring strange Chao and dead Kuan and hit away at Hua just to be reminded by Gioele that knifes are so much better at killing mush.</p><p>I really wanted to hide Ralulu under my bed and keep her but she died of her injuries and we were left with the "long boring survival" which looked a lot more like a short, slow death by suffocation but <em>Finola</em> (because Frieda went idle... badumtisss) <em>found us a lovely ... volcanic planet with oxygen</em>. Which Janice and I explored this morning, avoiding the volcano and<em> Janice cutting steaks out of everything she saw</em> down there we got some oxygen. All the while <em>Terrence powered through the Pilgred repairs</em> so here we are returning for moral reasons, well our hull was at 19 too.... but the panic attacks on our moral sources nailed it.</p><p><em>I'd like to thank everybody who stayed active.</em> You were totally awesome. I mean most of you were waaaaay to silent but still awesome. Especially <em>Ralulu and Janice</em> you were so damn adorable you gave me back some faith in humanity.</p>
