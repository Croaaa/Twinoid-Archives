                <p>AP thread for this ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8341" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8341</a></p><p>If for no other reason than I really want to explain what exactly happened here. I was Alpha Mush Janice, and Kuan was my partner. We converted both Eleesha and Ian.</p><p>So, Cycle 8 after Mush Selection. Kuan spiked Ian, and then spiked him again after day change. I converted him and took anonymush. Not too exciting.</p><p>At that point I wasn't sure what else to do, so I decided to trap Bravo Bay to hopefully hit one of the Pilots. Kuan noticed that Eleesha had started out with a spore and we tried to come up with a plan to convert her. But being up on the bridge, it would be too suspicious for me to go out of my way to spike her.</p><p>That's when Eleesha made her way back to the Icarus Bay for the expedition. When she reported the broken ship in Bravo Bay, she set off my trap. So her spore count was now at 2. Lucky break for us. Kind of. Not really though. But that's getting ahead of the story.</p><p>As you know, Kuan spiked Eleesha in Icarus Bay. I'm guessing you found that log thanks to Observant, and Eleesha just happening into Raluca like that. So you guys found TWO mush with that single move.</p><p>Lucky for me, I was in Alpha Dorm with Kuan when you guys started beating up on him. I used Defacer to clear the log and spike Raluca.</p><p>And I was telling the truth when I said the reason Kuan didn't have a death message was due to the logs being scrambled! In fact, I had hoped that one of you WOULD hack the BIOS terminal to verify that I WAS doing my job.</p><p>Anyway, that's when you guys started searching the ship for Kuan. I watched for a solid hour in disbelief that defacer had actually fooled you guys into thinking Kuan had run away instead of dying. In the end I knew I had to point it out, though, or risk you guys killing me for the lack of death message.</p><p>You guys also made short work of Eleesha, leaving me alone with an inactive Ian. But on the bright side, the confusion managed to stall the Plasma Shield from being finished for a few more cycles.</p><p>Once I saw that we were warping to a planet with only 4 armor left, the game was over. All I had to do was not turn on the plasma shield, or turn it off if one of you hacked the terminal to turn it on.</p><p>But that's no fun. If you guys were gonna die I wanted to do it myself! It's more personal that way. So instead of waiting, I turned off the Pilot Lock, hopped in a patrol ship, and the rest is history.</p><p>So everyone on this ship was either a mush, or died at my hand. I even got a nice fireworks show at the end! I consider that a victory. Even if it isn't a great one. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Kuan: You were a great partner, and you definitely did most if not all of the heavy lifting! It's too bad Eleesha ended up outing you like that. We might have been able to convert the whole ship if not for that... well, that and the ship getting blown to bits.</p><p>The rest of you: Good game! Kind of. You guys mostly just... didn't finish the plasma shield, and I definitely just swooped in for the finishing blow. But this ship should have been active enough to make it back to sol!</p><p>Sorry. I do consider this a win for me, though. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Yeah, but if they killed me before I could pilot the ship, the shield would buy them more time. That's what I was getting at with wanting to finish it myself.

                <p>Thanks for the AP Janice!
