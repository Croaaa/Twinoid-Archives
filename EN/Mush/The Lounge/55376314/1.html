                <p>After finishing the previous ship I felt lucky getting Hua and Chao to select meaning I could join Enigma's ship and I always thought of Chao, so I joined.</p><p>I pick Wrestler as a skill which was useful for me playing in both alignment, wait until selection and fate chose me not to be infected by Mush. Then I helped in comms and went to Alpha Dorm not noticing that Raluca was staying in Front Storage (I played on phone and map didn't show dots). Well, on the way to Alpha Dorm I kept accidentally following Raluca who tried to run away from me.</p><p>So my plan was old, plain and efficient: wait a while, pick torturer and mass check dirty people, kill a Mush or two if I get lucky.</p><p>How did it go? Well, crew had trouble with idle Gioele who held the Apron. I made a tough decision and expected hate, but I ignored him and started torturing people.</p><p>- I tortured Hua making sure that she couldn't extract any spores.<br>- I tortured Stephen just for HP check.<br>- I tortured Frieda making sure that she couldn't extract any spores.<br>- I tortured Jin Su just for HP check.<br>- I punched and tortured Janice to find out if she really got dirty just by taking a pill - positive.<br>- I didn't torture Ian because I believed in him giving all in research despite stolen apron. I considered his actions as human and taking Mycologist as well as pushing other people to participate into research made me think that it'd have been silly if he had done this as Mush.</p><p>I was disappointed that no Mush had taken an action. I started to trust all these people listed above and considered them human.</p>

I really don't know where I'm going to get my opening so I simply decide to start trapping ABay since it's next to my bed and route to and from the lab. Overnight we get our first hit... <strong>Hua</strong>, the level 6 gold that was already a priority target, <strong>Finola</strong> and I have alittle <em>squee</em> to ourselves <img src="../../../../gfx/square/fear.png" alt=":fear:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"> and back to bed.</p><p><em>The hunt continues</em> and being largely inactive and still doing bonkers things in the Nexus, <strong>Chao</strong> gives <strong>Kuan-Ti</strong> a serious working over and whilst this doesn't kill him, the results of the torture are shared and he's be beaten right down to <em>2</em> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">. I'm feeling better about this because I've been firmly installed as the go to for healing up incidents but I've been to the garden and I'm spent so simply mention in general that if we want <strong>Kuan-Ti</strong> to survive someone's going to need to heal him, but no one does, and the <em>Daedalus</em> does the rest. Another dead human... 5 of them gone, 2 living mush.</p><p>I remember <strong>Stephen</strong> at this time in the unconfirmed mush hunt channel, and truly none of us were confirmed, <em>"I don't think we have an inactive Mush team..."</em></p><p>The net is closing, not on me however, but on my partner in crime. <strong>Finola</strong> is doing research but obviously not at full speed, and her relay partners are infrequent from <strong>Chun</strong> and <strong>Janice</strong> when they have time, but with no one else falling fowl of investigation she is really starting to stand out.</p><p><strong>Paola</strong> has had a pretty low profile all ship and sadly not really done anything on the Comms. but she does wake up and moves through <strong>Raluca</strong>'s turret twice! Straight into <strong>Chao</strong>'s sights, to make matters worse for her, she needs to heal and so heads to the <em>medlab</em> which is naturally off limits as the alarms aren't finished which means even the <em>laboratory</em> isn't monitored. <strong>Finola</strong> receives a pleading message from <strong>Paola</strong> to ask her to trust her and she knows she's already in a bad light but understand it's safe! Well... As any self respecting <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><em>Mush</em></strong> at this point, <strong>Finola</strong> throws the poor girl under the bus, and alerts the crew to her coming through.</p><p>In the background to all this <strong>Hua</strong> has picked up a <em>second spore</em> and so we're finally getting somewhere! I make a plan to extract my 3rd spore, and since no one is even protecting the damn HULL at this point and it's down to <strong>13 (!!)</strong>, I step up. I extract my EXPENSIVE spore, strengthen the hull 5 times (including failures), open space capsules and get an oxygen capsule stuck to my hand, but I'm ready!</p><p><strong>Hua</strong> has started a chat with me by this point, and asked me to guard a <em>pilot mage book</em> that we found, and so after some back and forward I let her know I'm going to need her help with the garden at C8, and since the lab is not still not protected... <em>Alea iacta est...</em></p>

                <p>On the theme of vomit, Paola vomited and also Raluca had sepsis from surgery on her missing finger. We had some confirmed non-alpha mush. We had our own little mush-hunt channel.</p><p>I was the last to awaken and delivered the sample to the lab. There was a free bed in BD after I did some piloting (eating too). Stephen had the apprentice skill yet had a bed. Both him and Janice had left and returned to BD. They were among my first suspects early on. We can hope the mush are inactives but it is still worth considering the mush are actually active behaving human. I remember commenting in the little confirmed human channel about one mush who was a researcher (Andie, I think) who never extracted so didn't get dirty. I didn't think at that time, the scenario applied to this ship. If Paola hadn't thrown up, I would have suspected her. However, as she was comms, she dropped her tracker and walkie talkie so didn't know.</p><p>With a starmap fragment being an early find, this gives hope to both teams. With Ian patching up the hull, this either put him on the human side (Mush win if ship is blown to bits), or on the patient Mush team. He took mycologist which was actually rather sneaky. A mush can see who has spores on and I queried who he had healed. with Mycoscan not even being worked on, it would be difficult to check if he actually removed spores. However, it did make sense somewhat for him to heal Chao's / Ship's victims... research can wait, but healing cannot as the ships do give crew a shake and plate.</p><p>With inactives being traded or deaded, it became clear the Mush were among the active crew. Although now I did start to suspect the research team, mainly Finola - she had announced computer woes (I've had them) so she appeared offline for a while. However, suspicions do not make them Mush.</p><p>Jin Su was a little slow moving the ship. He was picked on a lot by Chao. Ian had passed to me Chao's torture results and it appeared to me Jin Su was human, however, patience was running a little low.</p><p>As a <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_garden.png" alt=":mush_pa_garden:" class="tid_ico"> I started to keep safe two banana trees. Having been confirmed human, I stay dirty for longer periods of time. I cleaned up to check on the nexus projects. Pump was at 71%, Trail Minimiser and Teslatron Reservoir were at either 72% or 74%. I wondered if I should advance TM but decided I'd better keep ap for piloting. It didn't occur to me that Neron Participation would finish off the one on the left (the pump) first, destroying the other two projects.</p>

                <p>Hello, <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/stephen.png" alt=":mush_stephen_50:" class="tid_ico"> here. This ship was a big surprise for me. I need to admit , I thought it's gonna be bad(due to inactives and that apron situation), which turned into a very interesting flight.</p><p>I guess this channel, which I've founded was my biggest mistake. Four people(Me, Janice, Ian and Chao), nobody was confirmed, nobody trust each other (but hey, it has changed so quickly. Too quickly!), nobody even thought you could be a mush Ian ! We have trusted you. I remember when I said: "I hope the mush team won't use this situation (with apron etc) and you said something like this: It would be a great start for them. I'm sure you need to at least smile at this moment <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"> Oh, well <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I'm looking forward to the next part of this story.</p>

                <p><em>It started to be my first degree of frustration. Now I will say how I reached second.</em></p><p>Gioele got killed by Stephen. It made me trust Stephen even more because who as Mush kills a human by his own? It doesn't happen and people doing this gain suspicion instead. And there goes first confirmed human - Frieda. I don't how she got sick, illness or disorter but we got the first one. The second one was Raluca who got a surgery failure and Sepsis which got healed.</p><p>I didn't believe Jin Su was a splashproof Mush who stealthed the shower. I couldn't believe that Janice washed herself nicely as splashproof Mush without taking opportunity to extract spores as it was told that I was only a Wrestler. Hua took a ration and went scavenging.</p><p>So the only people left were Finola and bunch of inactive people. Crew was waiting for Roland to land, but it took more than day and it was pretty long. I wished crew to find an oxygen planet and move away asap, just to get rid of grand inactifs.</p><p>I, the player who put a theory that believing that both Mush are inactive is a reprehensible mistake, decided to believe that both Mush are really inactive.</p><p>But crew was waking up and Roland decided to land. I tortured him and made sure he hadn't extracted any spores. Well, good of him, but I had a litte doubt as he could be aware of my skill.</p><p>Paola also woke up after a long pause. I told her to sell all people, so she began to trade. First sold - who? Frieda. Oh really? Of all people... human gone. Told her to continue - another human gone: Terrence.</p><p>I decided to gather AP and focus on lurkers. I felt that both Mush were in Finola, Eleesha and Kuan Ti. Paola couldn't sell anymore as the ship moved to an oxygen planet. Three days after selection was coming. I decided to check if they blink. I used torture for HP check.</p><p>And Kuan Ti also became active, was doing stuff on the Bridge. I decided to torture him and noticed that he had got as much damage as Mush taking a single shower. I asked others if Kuan Ti had visited Bravo Dorm - got a positive answer. I punched and tortured his 12th action - nothing mushy, but he ate, tortured once more - he double ate. I worked out that he was dying off starvation. So I just left him as he was - no ask for heal, as I was too introverted and he didn't seem to communicate at all.</p><p>Checked cycle change being sure Eleesha was supposed to starve and... no blink. I hit her and she died... as human. I didn't understand, I was convinced that my Google Chrome with installed Flash was catching blinks as I had noticed on some people in the same ship due to room shake. I killed a human.</p><p>So who are these both Mush? Which Mush did I trust? Fast back to Bravo Dorm and fast back to catch up! Mush is sporing I was funning with lurkers.</p><p>Meanwhile Kuan Ti is dying in the next cycle due to room shake.</p><p><em>I killed a human and put a Mush into trust. Frustration: second degree.</em></p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">Nah, I'm sleepy, next part of how I tried to get my account deleted soon.</span></p>

                <p>It was the first cycle of a new day when I had relayed some research (no hunters) returning to BD that Finola entered Bravo Dorm where I was resting (as was Jin Su, Janice and Raluca), removed the camera and converted me! Ian took anonymush. Jin Su had noticed Finola removing the camera. I just stayed quiet/offline.</p><p>When I awoke, Finola had been tortured and killed. Stephen had picked up a spore from Ian's booby trap. There are hunters out there and with the hull being low, I extract via fertile and mycelium spirit before taking off to deal with hunters. Actually, just one hunter - a trax which had been misidentified as an arack. I then load the rest of the fuel for Janice's planet. Ian had a quiet word Jin Su and he took us to the planet. As far as I could work out, only 2 missions had been given - one to Frieda who had been inactive and came back online to planet scan, and went superinactive. The other went to Finola - a mush. She had only days later accepted this mission and I guess this showed up in Chao's torture of her. Chao killed Jin Su, an outcome I wasn't particularly disappointed with.</p><p>Stephen and Roland wait in Icarus Bay for the expo to happen on Friday but there was no sign of the new commander. The expo is shelved for a while and the crew go quiet.</p><p>Saturday, I extract yet again via fertile and pilot. I go out for the day still awaiting the commander's presence in IB. Mycoalarms had been completed by now.</p><p>Roland is impatient and takes a patroller expedition and dies at the third zone. The aliens did not like his jokes! We are now impatient too and no sign of Chao. So... Ian, myself, Raluca and Stephen go down to the planet after I put a spore on Raluca.. BBRRIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNGGG. The cristalite zone was a mush trap but we were unable to recover spores although Stephen and Raluca were now at level 2 infection. Seconds after arriving back on the Daedalus, and on the new day, I convert Raluca just as she was dropping items and picking up her trakie! She takes anonymush.</p>

We had decided early on in the flight that we weren't playing hard and fast but we were realising that it wasn't realistic for us to target our conversions in our current bodies.</p><p>To somewhat answer the earlier concerns of how I got so trusted, it was because the ship made me that way, I wasn't following my own orders if you would, our captain <em>might</em> have done something to draw attention to himself, but I wasn't exactly sure, however my claim of needing <strong>Hua</strong>'s help was given firm backing when <strong>Chao</strong> tortured <strong>Jin-Su</strong> again, and it wasn't a little this time either. In the private chat he announced the inconclusive results of the torture and very directly stated "Jin-Su will need healing, I got him down to <em>1 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> </em>..." on top of this <strong>Stephen</strong> has also been plated so I had to spend the day in the dorm.</p><p><strong>Chao</strong> was losing credibility on the ship, because when <strong>Jin-Su</strong> woke up he posted the health loss logs from this torture, he's been tortured <em>5 or 6 times in a row!</em></p><p>In the real world I have things to do, and after collecting the better half from work we decide to do our usual food shopping, and it takes a long time... Too long! By the time I get back to the PC it's already half an hour into C8 and <strong>Hua</strong> has already tended the garden, and taken some plants with her no less. I wouldn't catch her that way.</p><p>Deflated, and running out of time for <strong>Finola</strong> I put my spore into trapping ABay again, hiding the trap under enough cover should I need it from torture and we wait and pray this would be some kind of miracle. <em>It's not...</em> The pilots have swapped dorms with <strong>Hua</strong> still being dirty and now it's <strong>Roland &amp; Stephen</strong> in ADorm with me, the trap would fail. Despite the hunter wave taking it's precious time and not arriving for some 4 cycles later, and me issuing warnings in public about the incoming wave being large due to it's absence (A genuine thing) it doesn't come in time.</p><p>Believing we're out of options, we begin to plan a <em>transfer</em> action for <strong>Finola</strong> in an attempt to do something meaningful with her life before she is lost to the Mush cause, we're feeling certain that <strong>Chao</strong> will simply kill her. She's not researching, and on top of that we believe that he'll NEED to find a Mush soon or the crew will simply kill him instead, he's killed more humans than we have, we haven't raised a hand in violence, peace, pacifism... We simply wish to spread tranquility. (Some 80 - 90% of the healing that's been done on the ship has been done by me, as a result of <em>mycology</em> and activity)</p><p>From his newest torture, <strong>Chao</strong> tells the unconfirmed channel that <strong>Jin-Su</strong> has issued a mission to his partner <strong>Finola</strong> to prepare for a huge rampage, and in public he declares that the captain has given <strong>Finola</strong> a mission and demands to know why!</p><p><em><strong>For the greater good, Finola I am sorry...</strong></em></p>

                <p>Being a level 18 gives a wealth of possibilities, and with level 6 Hua too. I could take tech, dismantle the shower, and if there were 2 spores for me to extract.. (there was only one via mycelium spirit)... Been on ships where we've / they've done this and the mood on board often changes. I have used mushification before, the animation is great for it! This strategy didn't really cross my mind for this ship, the peaceful way of the mush. With a starmap fragment, the way forward looked to be longterm: conversions and possibly Eden.</p><p>I was actually out fishing on Friday, from a nice set of rocks (no, you can't get crushed under but life had as this was full of fossils). Others with serious fishing gear had nothing to report perhaps because of a seal out there and left. My party of people did catch fish, but I didn't. It was a beautiful calm evening! Relaxing but arm aching (spinning for mackerel). Oh, and there was a 4G signal! It was quite a relief I wasn't needed while mobile - that sabotage button is too close to human actions on the Puffin browser!</p>

                <p><em>Continuing my story...</em></p><p>To the point I ended there's to add that Hua got ill from expedition and it was shown in logs.</p><p>One I could be sure: both Mush are in Finola, Paola, Roland, Stephen, Ian, Janice, Jin Su.</p><p>I tortured Stephen once and noticed he used a ration to shoot at hunters, but used 8 charges. I was trying to find out how it went with his full AP. I noticed microwave at 2 charges so it could be it that he used 12 AP and somehow to cover it. Nope. Microwave was broken, and Stephen wasn't at full AP because he had announced getting dirty and washed himself in Bravo Dorm (without soap, which had been destroyed due to fire before), he was on 10 AP. He must've cooked the ration without using microwave. With AP counting he exceeded the limit. He couldn't be Mush, especially when he asked to be tortured afterwards.</p><p>Paola got sick from Kuan Ti's death if I am not wrong, with Gantroenteritis. From all the people I guessed both Mush were Finola, who was dirty-phobic slow researcher, and Roland who was playing careful with my torture skills. Meanwhile, Roland was being cured from disorder and it was shown in logs.</p><p>It made me really afraid, beside Finola there were unconfirmed people I trusted very much and there was a Mush. I felt being pushed much under pressure, that focusing on Janice, Jin Su and Ian, I recalled Jin Su taking part on expedition without MycoAlarms. It was a long voyage and MycoAlarms not done yet. There was some useless Antispore Gas, but no MycoAlarms. I tortured Jin Su to make sure he hadn't spiked Hua but well... it didn't show me much, I tortured him down to 1 HP. Nothing. I told in public and private to Ian that Jin Su needs healing because I tortured him to limit. Jin Su shouted I was Mush but I didn't care that much if I got killed because the Mush overplayed me. I saw Jin Su consuming, accessing terminal and consuming again in torture results, but wasn't sure if he double ate, however he gained a slight trust there.</p><p>Looking on the Bridge I saw Paola hadn't printed the list from Xyloph yet, I was looking around to check if confirmed human were really confirmed, I wanted to check it myself. I asked for Raluca and Janice confirmed that she healed Raluca from Sepsis.</p><p>I went back to Bravo Dorm and noticed Jin Su staying there, once I checked his actions and noticed he issued a mission on the Bridge, between analyzing the latest planet and accessing terminals. I asked him who he sent the missions to and he told he sent the last one to Finola, but the first one was sent to Frieda. The main suspect was given a mission. Well, I just made sure no sensation would happen around day change, washed myself and went to sleep IRL.</p><p>In the morning IRL, I logged and noticed Finola removing camera in Bravo Dorm. I took a banana and a ration and went to Alpha Dorm, where was so crowded. Found Finola with Ian in the same room. I kicked Ian out the room and began to attack Finola, I tortured after two successful punched. I noticed her extracting two spores and infecting somebody directly, but no traps, no infecting food. I didn't finish her off because got tired, but Raluca did instead. I mentioned that Jin Su had sent a mission to Finola a day before.</p><p>Then Jin Su denies that he sent that mission the day before. He claimed that he had sent it three days before. It contradicted with my torture result. I was wondering about both Mush being between Finola, Janice and Ian, but I was convinced that Jin Su lied, so I ate a ration and killed him - he was human.</p><p><em>That's how I reached the highest, third degree of frustration.</em></p><p>I started to think that this "Issue a mission" was that he just clicked the action, but not sent a mission. But it broke my morale completely and stopped playing Mush. I went to my profile and intended to delete my account. I clicked to delete and waited until it'd confirm.</p>

I didn't know how much longer he would survive although I doubted it was very long, we wanted that <em>crystallite</em> planet and <strong>Hua</strong> had loaded up the fuel after the fighting and so we were ready to move... I contacted <strong>Jin-Su</strong> to be the eternally steady member on the crew.</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"> - "I don't know if you issued a mission to <strong>Finola</strong> or not captain, but if you don't move us to the planet now we're all going to die anyway"</span></span></p><p>A steady voice amongst the many angry voices aboard the ship paid off and despite raging that he was going to kill <strong>Chao</strong> for trying to murder him so many times and be damned what the others think... We were on our way, and although I don't think <strong>Jin-Su</strong> would really have killed <strong>Chao</strong> despite his understandable anger, he never got to see the planet, he was dead before we arrived.</p><p>As he has already told himself, our chief of security went into depression at this point and was simply stunned on the bridge. <strong>Paola</strong> had announced that they would not be able to be on duty for several days but had eaten to ensure they didn't starve and the a hush fell over the crew, at at least the humans... In the <strong><em>Mush</em></strong> corner we were trying to figure out how we would get our next victim and on arrival both <strong>Stephen</strong> and <strong>Roland</strong> reported to the <em>Icarus Bay</em> and were ready to explore the planet. So long as there wasn't a mindblender lurking in that <em>crystallite</em> field the <strong><em>Mush</em></strong> would gain from either outcome. A <em>starmap fragment</em> would further my vision, whilst a trap would assist in a successful take over.</p><p><strong>Chun</strong> had been injured and called me privately to heal her and I would not let my prize die on me, she was an endearing girl and I wanted to take care of her, I wanted to return her to her rebels, and to further extend the trust I had not only did I report immediately using my last energy to heal her<em> AND</em> relay the <strong>Mycoscan</strong> (The only thing that could discover me - 74%) I also gave her the <em>hacker kit</em> to guard which I was holding so that we would be safe on the planet.</p><p>All we were waiting for was for <strong>Chao</strong> to wake up and lead the mission to the surface, but he never did... A day or so went past and people were restless. <strong>Janice</strong> was waiting on the bridge with full bars and <em>IT points</em> waiting to scan. The away team was still waiting in the IB, and it was too much for <strong>Roland</strong> he took a patroller and went to the planet alone.</p><p>I watched as he reported in each zone he arrived at, praying that he didn't blow the <em>crystallite</em> I was lucky again, and whilst he never returned from the planet, he also didn't ruin our chances, not only that but he also encountered the <em>only illness</em> zone that was down there!</p>

                <p>So, after the expo and I had turned Raluca with the third spore and BBBRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNGGG in Icarus Bay, I head to BD and rest. It was a very close thing timing wise because Ian had to leave Icarus first and Raluca was putting down the equipment. We leave Stephen with his inactive status in Icarus Bay, with fingers crossed. However, Ian informs me he is back online and looking for the knife. He thinks Raluca is mush (yes) and goes after her. Raluca manages to extract a spore and convert Stephen in Alpha Dorm but under camera.</p><p><strong>Mush</strong> = Ian, Hua, Raluca and Stephen. <strong>Human</strong> = Chao, Janice, Chun, Paola.</p><p>Janice with her IT skills was in charge of planet scanning after Frieda's departure to discover the galaxy with others. As we were in orbit of the planet for more than a few cycles, she had full ap and had inactive status. She didn't know where to put her ap. After the expo, fatigue and launching accident had me down to 12hp and I suggested that she heal people, or do research or projects. She heals me then goes to heal the others but discovers the mush activity in Alpha Dorm, raising the alarm. She gives Raluca a disfunctional liver, however, insufficient ap means Raluca lived and was healed and she was able to do surgery, vomiting twice on the way there. Janice also notices Ian and thinks his failure to report the mushy business makes him mush. She thinks there are more mush aboard.</p><p>In the Mush Channel, we get concerned about Chao. With Raluca needing a few cycles to recover for any attempt at Pilgred and I didn't have much ap either, I feared he'd torture and find us mushes and deal with us. He had Wrestler skill too. So, it was decided I would transfer into Chao a cycle later and matched his skills, on the bridge. He was indeed full of ap. Janice notices Hua leave and concludes that Hua is mush. Chun comes to the bridge and carves chunks out of Hua. Not a pretty sight but was unable to finish her off. I torture my old body to see her health levels:</p><p><cite>Chao sets violently about Hua. They found a directory that was lying around and smashed them around the head with it... It's a bit bloody, but in the end Hua told him everything... Their last actions were: Transpossession, Infect, Remove, Extract a spore, Lie Down, Lie Down, Water Plants, Water Plants, Consume, Infect, Take Off and Infect</cite></p><p>Report was for a broken door. Take Off was for the expedition.</p><p>I also torture Paola once. She informed us of a period of inactivity (I hope you enjoyed yourself!) and was heading to eat something to stop her starving but found the refectory door broken.</p><p><cite>Chao sets violently about Paola. They found a directory that was lying around and smashed them around the head with it... It's a bit bloody, but in the end Paola told him everything... Their last actions were: Report, Lie Down, Establish Comms, Contact Xyloph and Decode rebel signal.</cite></p><p>But no food for her to consume and reset hunger. [Aside - would the other comms things be Upgrade Neron and Trade... or something like that?]</p><p>I come back online after a night's sleep to Hua dead by roomshake. I put the kettle on and discover Chun has started to take slices off me and my ear is dangling. I should have taken crazy eyes. I did so later. Surgery is successful and I can hear again. Chun is dangerous and she is upset about the betrayal. She still has the knife.</p><p>Enigma might like to write the next bit. I actually now regret not doing an NRJ. I haven't done one for ages and have forgotten some details.</p>

                <p>To sum that up at that moment my account was signed to be deleted:</p><p>Janice or Ian was Mush, I didn't know which one. I didn't feel it strong that Ian took Mycologist, he could've taken gold to get more Mush skills. I felt that if he had been Mush, we'd have been screwed as we'd get a Beta while he was installing the camera back. Janice was at most clear, Stephen asked if to kill Janice but I didn't answer... because I wasn't sure at all. Janice could've made rampage with Finola together, but Ian couldn't as Ian. Despite the suspect list was just two people, I felt done.</p><p>None of voyages I took part of has demoralized me like this one. I didn't care I was commander and had some more duties, that I had to send a mission because I didn't feel who I'd sent the mission to. I was aware of danger staying AFK as Chao, that it'd harm human team much if Mush decides to rampage with transfer, but I had a little doubt if they could transfer.</p><p>In the next day I cancelled delete account request. I joined the game but I didn't feel like I could do anything for crew. I felt I needed a help, a help from the crew in finding the Mush, comms officer to print the list which confirms either Janice or Ian as human, Mycoscan done... nothing. And when I noticed Roland died alone on expedition, I didn't feel like doing anything even leaving the Bridge.</p><p>Then got back in a few cycles maybe to do anything, but Flash error wiped out the screen and I couldn't do anything.</p><p>And got back in the next cycles and I was dead as Hua. That's the end of my story.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Well played, Mush. Demoralizing me to deny playing the game is an achievement nobody else acquired.</span></p>

                <p>I see you've been on a fair few ships. The problem with this ship, from the human point of view - the mush didn't appear to be doing anything mushy. Research was slow but did many others relay and Ian did heal, patch up the hull, etc.. It does feel a little depressing to have absolutely no clue whatsoever what is going on. I often play pilots or astro so I have something to keep me busy (although the mush hunt is everyone's business). However, the Mush were patient.</p><p>How many times have we said to ourselves - mush have rampaged, how uncreative/boring (although I semi-rampaged on my last ship as alpha), easily revealing themselves and dying early on, so the game just becomes us against RNG? I could have rampaged as Chao, but as the mush hadn't been aggressive, I saw no point - Paola would have been dead soon, and that left Chun and the original Janice. I left the humans to deal with my old body (how many ships see the old body of a mush being killed? this ship will not be the last...)</p>

                <p>I mean, what would the upgrade neron, and trade things look like via torture.</p><p>As for Jin Su - yes, he was tortured a lot. However, I still had doubts when I was human about Jin Su - was he mush or a newbie commander? I could have launched the expo a cycle earlier if I had a misison, but it didn't come. Was he giving anyone missions? Did he know what to do? We were in orbit of a planet for ages before Jin Su took us out of orbit, well after the expo was done. We were at 11? hull and Ian patched us up. When I'm human, if the Jin Su / Commander is not reliable, then I have no qualms about mutiny (or about killing a griefer/someone who has kidnapped the apron). I know Ian tried to help him - he moved the ship to the final planet. I also thought the Mush were not very high level, so would be trying for the long game. Ian said he hid extract/trap behind layers and layers of healing/plants/fixing hull/space capsules and that. Someone was around to heal victims of torture.</p><p>The Hacker Kit was used by newbie Kuan Ti to alter the bios before full ship. Kuan Ti advanced all the projects offered.</p>

                <p><strong><em> The family grows </em></strong></p><p>Despite what you now know about how the ship ends up, this was not what I had hoped for, and whilst I'll answer specific questions once I get out of storytelling mode, I'm now in a very firm position of safety and intended to stay that way, I hadn't intended to act so quickly, at any point in the journey. With <strong>Roland</strong> effectively clearing the way I call for us to get the expedition done as quickly as possible so we can get moving again, we're running out of oxygen <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> again and we need to complete the expedition and move so we can start searching again, infact we've lost 2 plants in a fire so we're heading for running out of oxygen the next day...</p><p>The crew is awake, and everyone is complaining about the lack of action so I call for anyone available to simply get to the <em>IB</em> <em>NOW</em> so we can launch and be on our way once someone hacks the terminal.</p><p>The away team quickly forms, <strong>Raluca, Stephen</strong>, <strong><em>Hua</em> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></strong>, and <strong><em>I</em></strong> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">. <strong><em>Hua</em></strong> wants to spike someone immediately and I'm none too thrilled with the idea because I know there's a <em>mycoalarm</em> unaccounted for and the obvious place for it to be was here in the <em>IB</em>, infiltration is still the goal and despite <strong>Stephen</strong> having a spore already, <strong>Raluca</strong> is deemed more useful however as PILGRED isn't even started, and I'm feeling confident I can convince <strong>Chun</strong> that she's safe if we can just convert and sacrifice one of the humans t enable <strong>Hua</strong> to take <em>anonymush</em> and vanish.</p><p>I step back out of the Icarus Bay saying that I'm going to get the <em>medikit</em> from the dorms to be able to heal up and cleanse in the event of a trap, and whilst this is true so that I can maintain my illusion, it's also because I need to take my <em>pacifism</em> out of the room to let <strong>Hua</strong> strike, and she does. I quickly get a message of "BRRING", I jump into the bay and reply with an equally stressed "LAUNCH".</p><p>We make, we're out of the IB and away from the damning alarm log, so now we have a tense wait for the expedition to conclude and for the <em>crystallite</em> to dictate which way we go from here, although in truth that decision has been taken away from us by the <em>mycoalarm</em>, there is evidence of the <strong><em>Mush</em></strong>, and my vision is shattered, a total stealth mission is no longer possible. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Our luck holds however, and finally the zone comes round and we lead the humans right into a <strong><em> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> Mush trap! <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> </em></strong>, both of them are spored, both of them now have 2 spores and just need a gentle tap to push them over. <strong><em>Hua</em></strong> has the spore to do it but she won't be able to do it while I'm still in the IB, we both need to be online immediately on the return to the ship, and we need to be faster than the humans...</p><p>The expedition returns and I don't even bother to drop my items, I bolt out into the RC, and moments later I'm greeted by <strong><em>Raluca</em></strong>... It was close, so close infact that she'd left the room thinking to both raise the alarm AND take <em>genius</em> to cure <strong><em>Hua</em></strong>. If she'd succeeded... There's no time to contemplate that though I've moved to the Engine Room and loaded some fuel and announced that we need to hack or move immediately! <strong>Chao</strong> is still offline of course, and we don't know that he's not coming back, he's still the major threat aboard the ship. The beta's haven't had the luxury or timing to pull of a covert operation, there are visible traces <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> in the IB now, and even more traces with tortured betas.</p><p>Silently I console myself by thinking that if <strong><em>Hua</em></strong> is killed, that I am still undercover, even to <strong>Stephen</strong> who is online! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico"> He's seen the alarms and reported them in the <em><strong>private</strong></em> (Which <strong>Janice</strong> has left by this point) channel to both me and <strong>Chao</strong>. I answer, <em>"What?! I didn't even see that! Did it happen before or after I left the IB?"</em> and he replies "After, where is <strong><em>Raluca</em></strong>? Where is the knife?", I dutifully tell him that <strong>Chun</strong> has it, and he simply replies that he's going for the kill.<br> <br>I warn my comrades, and still having an open slot and being high enough level <strong><em>Raluca</em></strong> takes <em>mycelium spirit</em> and so is ready when he enters the dorm for her blood... <strong><em>Stephen</em></strong> lies down next to her...</p>

AND <strong><em>Chao</em></strong> is the commander anyway so he can simply move the ship whenever we want. Total waste of energy... I set off back to the dorm, delivering both blasters to <strong><em>Chao</em></strong> on the way and find <strong>Ian</strong> in the CC, I suspect that he's gone to recover the <em>pilot mage</em> book in an effort to anchor us. I gently pick it up from in front of him as I am now the person who hid it, and wander off back to the dorm.</p><p>On the next cycle (I think) <strong>Ian</strong> is back in the dorm with me, and he's whispered me complaining about my petty act of leaving him without a trakie, and promising to find a way to hurt us.

I should have just stayed as <strong><em>Ian</em></strong>... maybe... maybe...</p><p><strong><em>Chao</em></strong> never wakes up before the end of the cycle, neither does <strong><em>Raluca</em></strong>. Suddenly I remember a conversation I had with <strong>Hua</strong> at the first expedition, I told her to take the <em>grenade</em> to the planet to get rid of it, and I thought she had but after the expo she revealed that she'd actually hidden in ABay!</p><p>Rushing to the bay I search, and it's there! This is the last chance, but I don't have the AP to throw it and it'll have to wait for cycle change and a hope that <strong><em>Raluca</em></strong> wakes up to kill him. Someone was going to die, and it was a 2/3 chance to be <em>Mush</em>... The cycle changes, and I see a death message on <strong>Paola</strong>, "HA!" I announce in the mush channel before reading it properly. She died to injuries on the bridge, it was <strong><em>Chao</em></strong> who suffocated.</p><p>Hating the moral victory that <strong>Ian</strong> was going to pull at the last minute I think and think and then... <strong><em>Chao</em></strong> died right? <strong><em>Stephen</em></strong> is the new commander! We have a MISSION, there's a chance! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I take the <em>grenade</em>, knowing that <strong>Ian</strong> now had a blaster OR had healed, and move. throw the <em>grenade</em> and with this act I make the <em>only violent action of an alpha Mush on the ship...</em> I've failed my internal mission but <strong>Ian</strong> is dead, and the oxygen capsules roll from his coat. I have exactly enough energy left to walk and inject them back into the system, we're not going to suffocate at least.</p><p>The wait for NERON to assassinate us starts but since I'd passed through the CBT to reach the CBS tank, I see there're 12 hunters out there, and a D1000... Facing against our 23 hull. We're going to die anyway...</p><p><strong><em>Raluca</em></strong> wakes up on 3 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">, and with a last scan of the astropad I see there's metal left in AB2, I ask her to repair what she can, and the mutate to heal and wait for our fate...</p><p><strong><em>And so it ends...</em></strong></p>
