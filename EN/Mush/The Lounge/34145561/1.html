                <p>Anyone have any interesting mush stories of final showdowns? That excellent moment when you drop all pretenses and go for broke? The wonderfully maleficent speeches to a doomed crew?</p><p>I'm finishing up a ship right now, only day 4, I was Terrance. Quite a few inactives. The clincher was my mush buddy Raluca taking out a suspicious Janice after we convinced them to kill Gioele. People dropped like flies after that until there was only 4 or so people left. So i picked up the knife, blaster and grenade and went to town! Finola, Ian and Hua the most active characters were all in the lab, so i chucked my grenade at them. Finola and Paola then died of depression next cycle, but I managed to finish off Ian using phagocyte to eat all my spores. Hua fled, I followed, mushy wheels squeaking down the halls. I then told her all about how Evil Terrance is going to enjoy himself gazing out on the stars as the ship burns around me after she's gone. The ship's still in great shape, there's just no people left on board!!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyone else got any good final showdown stories?</p>

                <p>On <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1340">this earlier voyage</a>, I ended up becoming the ship's primary scanner. When the Mushrooms were detected, a quarter of the crew became brain dead, while the rest of us continued on. <strong>Raluca</strong> was becoming suspicious but her bout with decreased morale and evidence for it quickly subsided. Therefore, as we planned an expedition to <strong>Upsilon Cargino</strong>, I began to reprise my suspicions. The chief and commander, <strong>Chao</strong>, and <strong>Terrence</strong>, soon accused the pilot, <strong>Hua</strong>, of betrayal when she attacked <strong>Eleesha</strong>.</p><p>This is where things get creepy and awesome: Through the ship's lifetime, I developed close ties with <strong>Chao</strong>, <strong>Terrence</strong>, and <strong>Kuan-Ti</strong> since they were the most active. At the time when they killed Hua, my suspicions reached a near climax. I ended up lying through my teeth to <strong>Chao</strong> and went for the <strong><em>Icarus Bay</em></strong> to gather the armor and a blaster...</p><p>What followed: I looked and saw that there were a total of four mush. I calculated with my thousand year old brain that one of the people I trusted was a shroom. Suddenly, I found myself leaving the bay and discovering that I was cornered. <strong>Eleesha</strong> was in the <strong><em>Rear Corridor</em></strong> while <strong>Chao and Terrence</strong> were both in the <strong><em>Bravo Bay and Engine Room.</em></strong> I ran to the refectory and downed a ration to finish them off, but a great urge overwhelmed me: I turned into a mushroom! <span class="tid_sideNote">dat irony.</span></p><p>In the end, we controlled most of the ship's activities following the assassination of Janice (who we announced tried to kill me, but she really didn't) and led the ship to it's death at the hands of fellow Mushroom federation fighters. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"><br><span class="tid_sideNote">turns out Chao, Eleesha, Terrence, and Kuan-Ti were the four mushes! I believe this was the best Mush victory I've been in <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico">. It didn't help that Kuan-Ti flaunted his ownership of the Daedalus haha.</span></p>

                <p>I just finished a game as Chao (my first game, actually!) where the ship was just about to keel over, with little armour left and hunters attacking. We had several mush suspects because people had repaired PILGRED almost all the way extremely early in the game - I had become commander after killing Jin Su, who had been dirty without explanation and been seen advancing the repairs.</p><p>So we have 7hp on the hull and maybe one cycle to live... and Giole waltzes onto the bridge and spikes me in full view of everyone as a nefarious distraction. Being Chao, I flip, pop some drugs and go racing after him, eventually corralling him in one of the central turrets, where I don't quite manage to kill him. We then get this exchange:</p><p><cite>Gioele : Not bad human. A shame I can not strike you back ... You should feel complimented that I chose to make you waste time and effort on killing me... Time and effort that you can not afford at this time. Your ship is dying thanks to the hunters and you will not return home as the rest of this crew is not the same caliber as yourself... "<br>Chao : Chao knows the ship is going down. Chao doesn't care. So long as Chao has fire in his eyes and a blaster in his hand, his mind his own and not belonging to scumbag fungus... then Chao can die a happy man. Chao spits on you... know that the last of his strength will be spent gouging out your eyes.<br>"Gioele : Precisely. You are the only worthy foe on this ship. Gladiator you who are about to die I salute you!"<br></cite></p><p>However... at cycle switchover, we JUST make it, and at that I launch myself from centre alpha all the way to Icarus Bay, where I eat a steak, before sprinting back, finding Giole in the front storage, and finishing him off. We actually got another of the mush - Roland, right after that, as he was making thinly-veiled attempts to spike me in an attempt to get the Sol victory for the mush. The ship didn't last longer though, and it eventually became clear that there had actually been two more mush all along... I wish I'd gone with my gut and flown off without Hua when she was outside the ship!</p>
