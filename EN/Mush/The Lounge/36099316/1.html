                <p>Well, here we go:</p><p>I woke up, it was already day 1 cycle 8. The room was filling faster then Chaos trigger finger. The ship <em>seemed</em> to be full of nice people looking for a great time, and I was impressed. As the hours passed, the crew split up and scattered around the ship. I had a feeling that this might be a fairly good ship... Well. I was wrong.<br>The rest of the crew woke up from their deep cryo-sleep. At least 6 people had cryo-burn from what we could tell, possibly more. Worst of all, <em>Chun</em> was drooling in one of the front turrets... So the inactives list grew, from what we could tell, Chun, Ian, Frieda, Eleesha, Kuan Ti, and Jin Su were inactive. So this meant, no list, no research, no plants, no planets, no projects... Within a few cycles, Stephen reported that Eleesha was dirty, and 'I am going to murder her.' And what do you know? A few cycles later, 'Death Registered: Eleesha - Assassinated.' Meanwhile, in the Front Corridor, something is going on between Janice and Paola. Paola claims 'Janice hit me, she is mush!' And Janice says practically the same thing. Moments later, Janice is dead. Our resident mush hunter, Chao, investigates the scene. He finds explosive residue in the hallway, suggesting the use of explosives. He immediately issues a kill order on Paola. It only took a few shots and hits and Paola was dead. Scratch one mush! In the mean time, Chao orders Stephen to be quarantined in one of the Centre storage's until he proves himself to be human. He mentioned something about being sick, then casually when inactive. A few cycles later, Chao eliminates a fellow human. Chao proclaims in the discussion channel his mistake, and he insists that he will take the mush test to prove his humanity. He is also sick. He takes a pill and a ration and accidentally consumes the ration first. Gioele immediately assumes that this was indeed not a mistake, and punches poor Chao to death. Yet another human is dead. By this point, at least 4 people had died from depression. We even had a shrink book somewhere that could have prevented the chaos that ensued...<br>We were starting to get low on crew members, as I noticed a fire on the alerts bar. And I thought - A fire? This early? No, that can't be right. So I go rushing around the ship (wasting a lot of my AP) to find this fire, which was just next to the dorm I was in, Alpha Bay 2 was on fire. There was no indication that the fire was accidental, as I could not find any neron announcements indicating that. The only person that had been in the room was Roland. I announced in the discussion tab that it was possible that Roland was mush. Roland proclaimed his innocence as he lied back down next to me. I wasn't convinced, but I wasn't going to open fire on one of my fellow team members without enough proof. The next cycle, Gioele rushes in, fists ablaze and punches poor Rolands face in. He too was human. He then punched me once, and left the room. I now had 3 illnesses - Gastrowhatever, Depression and demoralised.<br><em>Gioele: Well Roland wasn't mush, so I guess you are Terrence. Out of AP for now, he'll die later.</em><br>The next cycle, he died of depression. By now I knew my morale was going to be a problem, and I didn't think anyone else on the ship was going to care, so I took a morale pill and ate both bananas. The next cycle somebody else died of depression.. I felt kinda guilty. We were down to 5 crew. Myself, Finola, Raluca, and the inactives Ian and Frieda. Luckily for me (not so much her) Finola took the shrink book, and bolstered my morale up to 12. Later however, I put a biiig sus marker on Finola because a fire started and she was in the room when it happened. I requested she took the mush test but she was away most of the time.. A little bit later I was talking to Raluca in private chat, and asked her if she was mush, and she said no, and asked if I was mush, and I said no. I had to hop off at this point, and I come back 20 minutes later with 1 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">! I was scared and confused, but Raluca was a new player so I explained how I could not be mush as I was sick and had illnesses. She promptly apologised and I got myself healed up at the medlab. It was about to be day change, and I was asking around about morale, and Raluca only had 1 morale. Because Chun was dead, there was nothing we could do, and it was inevitable that she was going to die. It was really unfortunate too, I was hoping we could have repaired Pilgred and made a return to sol attempt.. We were running low on oxygen, and I knew the end was drawing near. It a last ditch effort to destroy the remaining mush, I took 3 oxygen out of the tank so there was 2 left, I hoped to kill the mush by exhausting our oxygen supply. Two cycles later, Ian dies of lack of oxygen, and Finola dies of depression... Then it was just me and Frieda. And the inactive Frieda was mush... I promtply grabbed my trusty blaster and scooter and headed to her location to end her life. It took two cycles to completely destroy her, it turns out that she had a blaster, knife and armour <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> So it was set in stone, I was the last remaining person aboard as the oxygen supplies dwindled to zero.</p>

                <p>Sounds pretty depressing! I hope your next ship goes better. Well here's a couple of things for you to know on future ships..<br>1 - When there's no 02 left, <em>Alpha</em> mushes do not die to lack of 02. <em>Converted</em> mushes can still suffocate. My mush partner and I once basically had to shower to death because we didn't want any more cycles to go on dragging our glory down.<br>2 - Pyro Mush is a <em>very</em> high level skill. If someone actually has it, it's very likely that they know how to use it properly to not get themselves discovered. It's generally safe to assume that fires are caused normally, which can happen early if your ship is unlucky.<br>3 - Raluca can still do the thing for :moral:, a guy just has to flirt with her first and she can initiate the thing.</p>

                <p>Nice tips! And wow, didn't know about the Alpha Mushes not dying from lack of O2.. The ship I just joined is actually doing great, really active crew and only 2 inactive players from what we can tell! I'm looking forward to <em>surviving</em> rather than <em>dying</em>.</p>
