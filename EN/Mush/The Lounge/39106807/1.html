                <p>Stephen here. Bronze player that started out with Solid and added Cook later on from a Mage book once we were Mush free. Game started with Jin Su and KT acting really strange. I killed them both and it turned out that KT was human but Jin Su was an Alpha Mush. About a day later Gioele who had been in a coma came out and became Captain. Apologized for being inactive, did random stuff, failed to give Andie a mission, and then went into a coma a second time! So with the consent of the crew we executed Gioele hoping he was Mush but turned out merely to be an inactive human commander. As it turned out our second Alpha Mush ended up being Derek. Before Hua killed him he had managed to turn Ian into a Beta Mush but Eleesha (and I also) thought he had turned Raluca. Derek played his part well by actually attacking Ian to make it convincing. Eleesha ended up killing Raluca and we found she was human. Now we know for sure that Ian is Mush. Problem is an Ian Mush is hard to bring down after the most active among us are low on AP. Ian managed to kill Eleesha and also attacked Chun but failed to kill her. I finally managed with some help to give Ian his death blow. By then we had lost Frieda, Paola, and Chun to fatal depression. When the dust finally settled there were six of us left. Awesome Andie, Hua the Mush Slayer, Ace Pilot Roland, the Lovely and Talented Janice, Wheels the Technician (aka Terrence) and yours truly. We managed to lose none of the final six in spite of everything the RNG threw at us. We finished Pilgred, did a couple of expos for air and food, and then finished the retro fungal serum. Awesome teamwork and I am proud of this crew. My biggest regret in this trip was the loss of both Raluca and Ian.</p>

                <p>Hua here.</p><p>This was a pretty wild ride - we had a crew with multitudes of skills for everything and a relatively active crew that held the ship together (pretty good for a non-Mushday and a non-MMM ship). Yes, we had non-chatters and griefers, but that is pretty norm for par. Honestly though, how the 6 of us managed to complete the Serum with a Chun that was just griefing (She ALMOST griefed us out of Plasma Shield with Rerouted Charges!) is well beyond me. Derek though really messed us up by getting our Raluca (with Genius!), Ian (who was doing a great job with our plants), Eleesha (who helped figure out our Mush), and Paola (who wasn't chatting at ALL, but she did her job more than well enough), all of whom were fairly active players against just one Mush (and one beta Mush).</p><p>Hope to see you guys on another ship!</p>

                <p>Yeah, we had a tight moment with Chun advancing some random project for a while (was it sprinklers?) instead of Plasma Shield. Since it is much easier to complete and since we had Neron participation already, we had to practically outrun Neron on this one <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/angry.gif" alt=":anim_bad:" class="tid_ico"></p>
