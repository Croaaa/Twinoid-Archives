I was Chao and I murdered at least 4 people myself. BUT I GOT ALL THE MUSH!</p><p>Seriously though, lots of new humans and at least one professional Mush made it an exciting voyage. Ian, Roland, and Frieda taking breaks in turrets and corridors despite constant warnings to not do that. THEN Jin Su accidentally leaves Hua behind while moving the ship. Sadly this was a total human mistake but caused a lot of suspicion early.</p><p>We weren't getting much research done and Finola was whining about Real Life problems. I hope it wasn't a tactic because I think mixing RL into your lies is dirty pool. At the same time I can't say I want it to be real because it sounds like someone's uncle is having a real hard time. ANYWAY, turns out Finola was a Mush of course (she used the cat and human Finola's CAN'T do that), and took advantage of probably the most bloodthirsty (and flirty) Chun I've seen. Chun convinced Eleesha to kill Raluca because it "looked" like Finola had transferred. THEN Finola used CEASEFIRE to gain some AP, spore and hide before getting murdered (by me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">). Then Chun decided Eleesha was Mush and I (Chao) killed her too. Oops, she was human. I also killed Roland who was AFK in a turret and we had just gotten a new Mush. Roland was sadly human as well.</p><p>Oh did I mention Paola was mostly inactive and Janice went super inactive in the refectory? While all this madness was going on Ian usually went AFK in the hydroponics, Frieda was blissfully scanning planets, and Stephen was being a real ninja (he was Alpha Mush) just doing random things and keeping a super low profile. I had suspected him for a while but with so many possible suspects I couldn't just shoot him. Terrence was bravely putting out fires and fixing stuff, and Kuan was just pushing through those Projects.</p><p>After Finola was slain and there were 2 Mush left, I was really hoping they had wasted an infection on Janice (she's a great target) but alas she died of depression. Then our Jin Su went inactive and I became the commander.</p><p>Finally Frieda (beta Mush) made a mistake, I think she was hoping Chun's morale was so low with all the deaths that she could spam demoralize and kill her, but Chun reported it to me and I killed the evil Frieda. I'd really like to know how early she got turned because she was definitely really low on my radar.</p><p>At this point most people had given up. We had 1 day of oxygen left, no pilots, stuff was broken and half the crew was dead with a couple more inactives. I decided to put my suspicions to the test and just murdered Stephen in cold blood. Turns out I was right!</p><p>Unfortunately it was too late to turns things around and we all died. Shout out to the 2 Alpha Mush that played really well and abused the crap out of our incompetent and inactive human team. Losing Janice so early to inactive REALLY SUCKS, and I know playing Mush Finola is really hard. Stephen though played real quiet and did great. I did complain about him wandering the corridors and "visiting" people a lot but there was always so much going on it was impossible to follow up.</p><p>Also Chun I'm sorry we weren't able to the do the thing before the Daedalus blew up... We got all the Mush though! See you in another life.</p>
