                <p>I was Janice, felt the name was appropriate seeing how I betrayed everybody and can take credit for most of the crew deaths. Finola and Freida were also mush. You guys didn't know about me until I moved a ship while Kuan Ti and Chao went on expo, killed the cat, gagged Chun and Eleesha, took the last 3 oxygen, and went for a joy ride in a ship. I'll go into more details later, I'm off to bed.</p>

                <p>Granted this ended last Sunday, I feel like I need to tell the story.</p><p>I finally got the chance to be Janice and took it and I'm #15 of 16 people on the ship. Janice always ends up mush or inactive, so I knew I could be a useful Janice....11 ships and never a mush. Looks like Paola made contact with Sol and shorted myself and Raluca on morale....not to mention the last person to join.</p><p>Now should I stay here and wait to see if I'm mush or go and be useful? I comfort Raluca, find the mush sample, apron, soap, everything a mush wants and put it all in proper spots before the ship is filled. Use most of my ap only to find out minutes later, I'm mush<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Now I finally get to find out what this game is about. I get so excited I go into the rear corridor and spore, wait why did I do that? I was so hasty and excited I just gave away myself and have no ap left. I will be dirty and no reason to be. I need to stay calm and remember I am an experienced player. Just got too excited about being a mush is all. <br><br>I HAVE SKILLS! Yeah lets pick Phagocyte, Trapper, and Demoralize. I think I'll save the last spot for something wicked I have planned. Ok now I can eat my spore and find a way to get dirty that will make the crew trust me. Only thing I can do at this point in the game in install a camera in the other dorm room. It's against ever fiber of my being but I best cover my tracks. <br><br>Alright day 2 starts and we have a few inactive, not sure if my mush partner is gunna be of any use. I figure out a game plan for the day. I see Frieda sitting in the front corridor, no protection, she may be inactive....good to know. Ahh Raluca fell asleep in the dorms her morale will be down to 6 or so. She'll be prime for a demoralize. Ok save up my ap and hope my other mush partner comes online.<br><br>Got some ap now and I see a broken door. I'll fix it and spore twice. Went and spiked Freida, she's got the zzzz's. Now down to the rear turret to finish off Raluca. Only 5 minutes left before the end of the cycle. Hit her with <strong>DEMORALIZE</strong> 3 times, 5 mintues later she dies from depression.<br><br>Finola, the other mush, is active. I tell her to spike Freida, so I can convert her tomorrow. She does and it works. The crew is very trusting of me, I go and help out in the Nexus once in a while but never too much. I don't tell any1 about the Bios settings and just leave them be for now.<br><br>Day 3 I try a to sabotage, but nothing really works out, try and stay clean for most of the day. I spore at the end of the day and tell every1 I ate, then I spore again at the beginning of the next day. Now I go and Turn Freida into a mush and activate my last skill.....<span class="tid_wspoil">Anonymush</span> If she stays inactive I can point the finger at her. If her and my fellow mush fall I can go about my business without any troubles.<br><br>Eleesha has taken a trust in me, I tell her to be weary of Freida, she should have starved to death by now and mush don't eat. <br><br>Day 4 and I grab the hacker kit to move the ship, saw Roland go for a ride and kill the hunters. I can chalk this one up to ignorance. As soon as I make the "mistake" I own up to it and sound real convincing in my apology.<br><br>For those keeping score that's 3-0 mush.<br><br>Day 5 and all hell breaks loose, eleesha prints the list and kills Finola right away. Freida also loses her life to Eleesha. But now with no mush shown above people will put their guard down. I even get dirty checking the fuel in the engine room and report it.....we make jokes about how we don't need to anymore. I load 1 fuel so that we can "Take off right after the Expo" (hehe).<br><br>3 oxygen left, I could just take them and run off in a ship....But I have a better plan. I convince Kuan Ti and Jin Su to go on an expo, 5 minutes before the cycle ends, there's a chance for O2. I turn off the BIOS setting that announces deaths, then I move the ship, 2 more dead. I built up some spores and ap, now time to bring this crew to it's knees. I go and gag Chun, gag Eleesha, then grab the cat and blow it's brains out. Grab the last 2 O2 capsules and go into a ship. I notice the people dropping like flies from asphyxiation. Come back on board and the last person dies before I get to them. I put the O2 back into the tanks and ride this ship straight to hell. </em></p><p>I must say, this was really fun and I enjoyed using an inactive as a decoy. Wish Finola wouldn't have died but it worked out to my benefit.</p>
