This is Jin Su, Alpha Mush. I really wanted to try Jin Su as I've never done it before, but the RNG threw me a curveball making me Mush. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/angry.gif" alt=":anim_bad:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Still I did what I had to. At first I was pretty scared, 4 skill Gioele, Janice, and Ian. It also looked like there would be a lot of actives. Lots of people were doing stuff early and there were 5 cameras to start.</p><p>Derek was new but he listened to my advice and we made great headway as the standard number of people went inactive in dumb spots and people didn't practice good security. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I think a few people gave up after some early deaths. KT flew off the handle and just killed Andie straight up and he wasn't even Mush. She screwed up a little but the aggression was definitely unwarranted. However Derek and I used this as an opportunity to shut him down early.</p><p>After that it was pretty easy. No main researcher and no main NERON guy slowed research to a crawl. Then Paola went inactive and Eleesha was really late getting into comms. No bases, no NERON updates. Also I want to go on record saying I did NOT take Traitor. That expedition (one MIA death, lots of damage, only got some O2 and nothing else) was legitimately terrible! I felt sure someone would complain about a Traitor!</p><p>Overall I think it could've been a good game if the Humans hadn't given up so quick. I really want to shout out to Eleesha, Frieda, Hua, Janice (before she was turned), and Raluca. They stuck it out even though others had given up. Keep up hope! Inactives ruin the game. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Derek, you did great. Being a young Mush is hard because you have so few choices, but two active Mush can go a long way to making a great game playable. Terrence you were a big help when we finally tagged you. Janice sorry it took so long, but at least you won the game technically. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway, hope to hear from people!</p>
