We started with one pilot only, and on Day 2 the last of the 5 first hunters was still slowly destroying our hull. Then on Day 3 we got about 12 hunters, and Jin Su, who was almost idling on the bridge and hadn't said a word, never responded when asked to move the ship. Chun lent me the hacker kit and we managed to escape, only to get 14 hunters 2 cycles later, and then a few more at the beginning of Day 4. What with the increasing damage to the hull and our oxygen stocks slowy getting lower, I really thought we wouldn't make it.</p><p>And then everything miraculously changed. Raluca finished the current project, and the next one was the plasma shield, which she immediately completed with her Genius skill. Janice activated it just in time. Paola found a Pilot book in the front storage and got a Shooter book from Xyloph. Hua took the Shooter book and Gioele became a caffeine-addict pilot. Frieda found a great planet with oxygen.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chun, Raluca and I were watching Jin Su, who had never said anything, but had entered and left the shower dorm for no reason, and then done a speech in Alpha dorm and gone back to the bridge. Chun used Premonition, and sure enough, his last action had been to spike someone on the bridge. One mush down. Chao was our new commander (a beginner who was on his first ship and turned out to be a remarkable commander), and he immediately took us to Frieda's planet, thus enabling us to escape the hunters and to get oxygen.</p><p>The second mush was trickier to catch. I knew Finola and Chao were human, because they had been sick. Ian was too, because I'd seen him eat twice in the same cycle. Raluca had told me she suspected Jin Su, she wouldn't have done it if she had been mush. Our three inactives were innocent too (Roland was negative on the Xyloph list, Stephen and Terrence were starving). That left Hua, Paola and Kuan Ti who had never set foot in Bravo dorm, and Gioele, Frieda and Janice, who all seemed to be active and do their job. But then we found a key witness. Both Raluca and I had noticed that Janice had cuddled the cat on Day 1 and been dirty because of PILGRED. It was the only clue was had, so I got Schrödinger to scratch me, and then I checked my infection level with the mycoscan and saw that I'd been infected. Finola then rushed the retro-fungal serum while the rest of us watched Janice in case she tried to do something (and while I stayed in the dorm, feeling slightly nervous to be in bed with a mush watching me sleep...).</p><p>Eventually, we finished the retro-fungal and cured Janice who confirmed that she was the last mush, and finished PILGRED on the same day. A few days after being nearly blown up by the hunters, our hull was repaired, the plasma shield was at 100, we had plenty of oxygen thanks to Ian and his banana trees, and we had no mush left. Too bad we didn't have any luck during expeditions, but we lasted until Day 13, which was quite an achievement after being so close to death on Day 3.</p><p>If you read this, guys, well done to all of you, it was a pleasure. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2144" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2144</a></p>

                <p>I wondered who you were too. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I think poor Chao won't dare search for planets now, because every time he found a nice-looking planet, expeditions were a disaster. It could have been worse, though, especially the last one with two shipwrecks. We didn't find anything interesting, but no one got injured or killed...</p><p>We could have escaped the hunters on the last night, I think, if the pilots had been there. But people would have died, like Kuan Ti who starved to death 2 days ago. I still can't understand why he let himself die when we had told him where to get food and offered to heal him. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"></p>
