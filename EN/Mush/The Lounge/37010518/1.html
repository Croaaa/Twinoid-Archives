                <p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3071" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3071</a></p><p>Gotta go to work, no time. I was Jin Su.</p><p>9 made it alive to D16C7. Mush did very high damage, Hua killing Chun, Chao, and greatly wounding Eleesha and Kuan; Gioele went for me and we ran around the whole ship with him going punch punch stab stab.</p><p>I ended up the first 'no more AP for him or I' with me in medlab, him in bravo bay... me with 2 health left, haemorrage, critical haemorrage, and busted arm joint. Finola and Janice saved me while others managed to get Hua dead, then Gioele came for me again. More fleeing, and dances around Ian, and low AP for all... Gioele got me again, back down to 3 AP and another critical haemorrage. The ship saved me again, keeping me healed through a long night before I and Finola could be online again for a 4th surgery.</p><p>You're a great surgeon, Finola. And a great researcher. And quite active, I think you were online, at least to check in, 3-5 cycles a day almost every day.</p><p>We had 2 highly actives, myself and Stephen; poor Stephen and I butted heads incredibly much early game. Stephen recommended stuff instead of alternate stuff, and the path he recommended I felt would cause the ship to not survive into the long days; this ship started with the ingredients of an Eden ship and the mush didn't kill what we needed most; a Janice who would become diplomat right before D9. So I was pressing hard to have our ship live a long time; this would have been my third random ship to Eden in a row had that worked out. Stephen was always very helpful in actions - he either did stuff that was clearly good for the ship or stuff that had been voted on and agreed would be done. For the last half of the ship, Stephen stopped suggesting and recommending what I thought was bad advice and started really being a great co-leader, and truly working, in words as well as actions, to try and see the best win possible.</p><p>I'm still perfectly happy with 3 random ships that made it past D15, all with human wins.</p><p>Paola, awesome comms work. I had logistics but rarely helped Paola's AP gain except for missions; she Neron Upgraded us the plasma shield on the first try, and kept nailing great projects with every following upgrade too. She did a total of 7 Upgrades, was glorious. At one point we actually had everyone stop doing Nexus Projects and had only Paola working on Upgrades, because there were so many good projects left, so few bad ones, and Paola was able to complete about one a day. She also caught all the comms and did all the Xyloph; fast as fast can be.</p><p>We had a second sofa blueprint and got a lizaro from comms; took until D8 or so to get that dismantled (we got an artifact opener then that helped greatly). At one point we were down to 2 fuel and had to collect scrap for enough fuel to continue. We spent about a day waiting for Eleesha to log back in and either drop the medkit or leave Icarus bay so we could do an expo that we had a time limit on (we needed air!) and finally I killed her because she was low health, it was a deadly dangerous planet with many high probablility of 2 damage to all zones, and the loss of that medkit would have meant the death of a lot more crew.</p><p>I'm sure Ian will make sure that I am court martialed for that one, his shout of "MURDERER" still rings in my ears.</p><p>The second sofa going into the refectory, along with Stephen's online or at least checking in usually 7 cycles a day, and his having shooter and agreeing to read the pilot book, it really helped.</p><p>Janice was amazing, her long talks with me kept me calm and focused upon our dream of Eden. Her comfort, passive, active, and verbal helped keep a sense of balance and focus. We went a long time without Mankind's Hope and through a great many human deaths, most of them not through suicide and 4 of them in rapid succession early. She was also online a good 3-6 cycles almost every day.</p><p>Terrence was also a strong star; He was also online for part of 3-6 cycles almost every day. He did a lot of Tech work, also a lot of drone upgrades; he wanted to experiment with pathfinder though... I think it did mess up the drones a bit, they seemed to want to go to the engine room all the time, despite stuff being fixed there and needed elsewhere. At least I was able to reliably collect them from the engine room when I needed to move them. Oddly, though they were pilot drones - near as I can tell only one took off once. There was always something else for them to do. Terrence and Stephen together finished Pilgred very early, around day 5 or 6 I think.</p><p>Kuan Ti, Ian, and Roland also did their jobs very well. They were less able to be online, but they worked as hard as they could to get done what needed to be done.</p><p>We managed 2 expos to crystallite, but we only got spores for our efforts; we got a few artifacts but none were starmaps.</p><p>There's probably more to say, but work, yeah. Hope to hear from you here, team, you were great!</p>

                <p>Forgot to add: Chao, I greatly missed you after your early and rapid death to Mush Hua. You were on the ship just over a day, but your way of speaking and playing was a big part of that first day's feel to me; I was very, very sorry we lost you - sorrier than that we lost our Chun, who was a fine Chun and I wish we had kept.... but Chao, I really hope to play beside you again someday. Keep being the neat player you are!</p>

                <p>This ship sure had it's touch and go moments early on! A Mush suicide bomb is a very disorienting affair, so I'm super happy we managed to pull through it and get all the way to D16, even if we had to cut it short due to some terrible RNG and unfortunate IRL circumstances.</p><p>To the crew who survived, thanks all of you for being wonderful people to play with, despite the arguments in the early game, we really pulled it together and went for the common goal of trying to get Eden. <strong>Terrence</strong> and <strong>Stephen</strong>, you guys were amazing getting Pilgrid going so fast, and generally keeping the ship running. The drone army was strong (if a little dumb... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">), and the coffee was hot. <strong>Paola</strong> you have to be the best good luck charm in terms of getting good Neron updates! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> You seemed to be the only good luck we had on this ship.</p><p><strong>Ian</strong> thank you for all the bananas I devoured to stop myself from sinking into depression, your plants did not go unappreciated. <strong>Finola</strong> you had your work cut out for you trying to keep the crew alive, yet you still managed to knock out most of the researches by yourself. <strong>Roland</strong> you did great keeping all those pesky hunters off us and generally being mysterious about it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> The silent warrior one might say. <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> despite being told to not do projects for a fair bit of the game, you still managed to find your place and keep yourself busy helping out all over. Your love for <strong>Finola</strong> and rivalry with <strong>Ian</strong> were truly an amusement to me, a soap opera in the making I say!</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> what can I say. Best Captain I've ever flown with, if a little bit heavy on the lectures. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> You kept me sane in the early game and always had sound advice and direction as to what I, or anyone for that matter, should be doing at any given time. I appreciate all you taught me about getting to Eden and other mechanics of the game, and hope that everything turns out ok for you IRL.</p><p>To all the crew who saw it through, I'd happily play with each of you again! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Much love,<br>-<strong>Janice/Neron</strong></p>

Without you, I do not believe we could make it to day 10.</p><p>Special thanks to Kuan-Ti and Ian for their signs of affection <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I really hoped this could be my first trip to Eden. These random ships are usually bad for me (I already died once, after our game ended).</p><p>Thank you all and I hope to travel with you again!</p>
