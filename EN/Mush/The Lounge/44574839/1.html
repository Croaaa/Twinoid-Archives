After that it was just future building and such. Good fun. Most of the active talkative people were mush, so we took a bit if a verbal beating. But I got to write text walls.</p>

                <p>Time-traveller <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hua.png" alt=":mush_hua_50:" class="tid_ico"> Sam/Hua here!</p><p>I got off to a rough start... I gulped really hard when I saw my original secret motive:<br>Doctor. Freaking. Who. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Don't tell me - Doctor Who is totally awesome, right? ...I know, I <em>know!</em> I've wanted to check it out for a long time, but I just never got around to it. So I asked some fans for advice on how to RP him, and tried to do some "research" by reading the wiki and watching a few episodes. And this is pretty much how that went: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc_5tx7xRlg#t=62">(Bon Appétit!)</a></p><p>It's a <em>massive</em> multiverse of very unique lore, with all of these recurring characters, races, factions, places, technologies, quirky devices, and convoluted story arcs that span multiple series... And everything has its own detailed history and RULES and exceptions and <em>GUUHHHHHH.....</em> There's NO way I could have pulled it off, except to act like a smug Brit and feign amnesia on EVERYTHING, but even then I'm certain I would have inadvertently contradicted the canon. I'm just way too OCD to perpetrate stick-figure portrayal of a mega-series protagonist, but I didn't have time for a deep-dive - it was paralyzing. Sorry I'm kinda neurotic like that.</p><p>Thankfully, Derek noticed my awkward silence after a couple of days, and suggested I should talk to our fabulous game moderator, Artie, about my motive. Long story short, I became Sam Beckett, the time-travelling hero of Quantum Leap. The canon lore was MUCH smaller, and I had actually seen a few episodes already. This was totally doable, and it was a huge relief. Once I finally got into my role, I had a GREAT time!</p><p>My secret mission was to save Janice from certain death, to prevent NERON from enslaving humanity. She and I had some fantastic RP in a PM:</p><p><a href="http://pastebin.com/YgrPTnS1" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/YgrPTnS1</a></p><p>Then some stuff came up for Janice IRL and she wasn't able to continue playing. So I futzed around for a few days and eventually came up with an idea to broaden my motive to engage the whole crew:</p><p><a href="http://pastebin.com/EfKVJzrk" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/EfKVJzrk</a></p><p>Shortly after that, Lucy (KT) asked me to send a message back in time:</p><p><a href="http://pastebin.com/FbrZHV68" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/FbrZHV68</a></p><p>Then Derek had a theory that evil Mush Patrick might be the cause of the timeline error I was supposed to fix:</p><p><a href="http://pastebin.com/GPyzRuQg" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/GPyzRuQg</a></p><p>During that conversation, Derek's Mush side, Lan, convinced me to stay in the future. But the devil is in the details.... Lan sent a message back in time to himself, where he converted Hua-in-my-body to Mush and destroyed the equipment Al used to communicate with me. I was cut off.</p><p><em>Rainy, that was so badass, I was truly shocked. But it was a delightful shock of the very best kind - Thanks for the excitement!! </em></p><p>Then Lan explained the message, and its consequences - all the Mush in Sam's time were advised to stay far away from humanity. Lan's goal was to rewrite history, with the best of intentions:</p><p><a href="http://pastebin.com/EYknNJqr" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/EYknNJqr</a></p><p>But this disrupted the timeline and created a paradox. Mush-Hua-in-Sam's-body led a war in the past to resolve the paradox, causing her to jump back into her own body on the Daedalus, thus it became a stable time-loop:</p><p><a href="http://pastebin.com/Nsu5WAM8" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/Nsu5WAM8</a></p><br><p>Meanwhile, Paola, Ian, and Raluca had formed an anti-Mush conspiracy. Paola had agreed to go undercover as a Mush, to learn their Mushy secrets. Then Raluca was going to administer a Retro-Fungal Serum to eliminate the Mush from Paola's mind.</p><p>But Paola had a change of heart after she met her lovely Mush companion, Sunandra, and witnessed the great lengths Lan had gone to in the attempt to protect both humanity and Mush from the tragedy of their fate. She realized that the Mush are no more evil than humanity, and she decided to keep her bond with Sunandra.</p><p>Andie's evil Mush Patrick had been taunting the crew with gleeful psychotic bloodlust, and Paola finally had enough. She told the Mush about the conspiracy, and told Raluca to cure Andie, to eliminate the danger of Patrick. Unfortunately, Raluca ignored her and proceeded with the original plan:</p><p><a href="http://pastebin.com/szgfcQuk" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/szgfcQuk</a></p><p>Andie tried to rid himself of Patrick, but Patrick began an all-out assault on Andie's psyche, leaving him as a hollow shell of his former self. Then Derek and Lucy battled against Patrick and eventually subdued him:</p><p><a href="http://pastebin.com/ZEXLm4t6" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/ZEXLm4t6</a></p><br><p>Hua needed to deliver a message from the ancient Mush to the present time, but she was merely human once more in her own body. So she asked to rejoin the Mush collective:</p><p><a href="http://pastebin.com/7i5w7CnK" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/7i5w7CnK</a></p><p>And in doing so, she finally met Sam, whose mind had become part of the collective when he jumped back into his own body.</p><br><p>THAT'S ALL I GOT! There was a LOT more fantastic roleplay on this ship, but I didn't manage to save anything else. Hopefully some of the other players can fill in the gaps with the gems I'm missing.</p><p>Hands down, my favorite ship to date. Co-op play didn't detract from the experience at all, for me. Quite the opposite, in fact - eliminating the paranoia let me really focus on the story, which is the part I enjoy most.</p><p>But even without the paranoia, the shocks and thrills were still every bit as powerful. I'm telling you, when Raluca cured Paola instead of Andie, the whole ship completly shat iteself. The emotions were raw and genuine, and rather uncomfortable at the time. But after re-reading it with some distance, I think it was clearly a brilliant twist in a great story. I wish we had worked out a better ending, but it was still SO much fun to have been a part of this. Thank you all.</p><p>And thanks again to all the moderators, especially Artie, for putting this together and working out the kinks on the fly, to make it the amazing experience it was.</p>

                <p>Don't forget Stephen. The coalition was originally Ian, Paola, and Stephen. Once I got continually more annoyed I declared my intention ti genius the cure. I asked Paola to hack the terminal so I could do so when she wanted to cure Andie. She did not. Maybe I'd have cured Andie if she had. Anyways, I secided to take the mission upon myself. Armed with coffee, a hacker kit, and genius intellect, I unlocked the terminal and made the cure. Then I cured Paola. I still hold that it was a psychosis. Then she goes and gets herself infected again so we can't study the effects and Raluca goes on racial rants against the mush.</p>

                <p>Hey guys, <strong>Janice</strong> here.<br>It was very, very much fun as long as I was able to follow.<br>My ulterior motive was great, because I was not actually Janice but a quite evil Hacker-Queen named Megan who accidentally murdered Janice and took her role.<br>My motive also told me that I actually hacked NERON.</p><p>So I thought a bit about what it would mean when a such evolved, complicated and awesome AI like NERON would be "hacked" and came to the conclusion that my Megan might have caused some unwanted changes.</p><p>The first thing was that NERON thought of himself as DIETER now. The other thing, which was more important and I would really have liked to play that out more, was that Megan-Janice thought it would be a good idea to make this ship AI treat her a bit better than the rest of humanity. This resulted in DIETER building up his own religion where Janice was his goddess.</p><p>I am very sorry I could not continue with RPing - would have fit pretty good with Hua's motive because an AI falling into some kind of religious crusade might really end up in destroying the universe.</p><p>For Megan-Janice I tried to avoid any intensive contact with other crew mates - what was not easy, petending to be the shrink. I also decided that it would be funnier to share the thoughts of my char - leading to reactions like</p><p>"Yes, of course, thank you very much, Kuan Ti." <em>I must kill him. Soon.</em></p><p>It was the most fun way to play Janice I ever had!</p><p>Thank you very much Artie for all the effort you brought into this theme, special thanks also to Hua, Derek, Chun and all the others who made this a great RP experience, even though I had to cancel very early.</p><p>P.S. <span class="tid_user tid_user_8356287 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8356287">Versatio</span>: Your first pastebin doesn't work<br>P.P.S. <span class="tid_user tid_user_737961 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="737961">Rainy</span>: I hope I could prove that not <strong>every</strong> of my female chars tend to be hysteric <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Versatio, thanks for posting most of the gen stuff I would have posted. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>Saves me the trouble of uploading my screenshots for those unless there's anyone who would find them more palatable and wishes me to do so, in which case say so and I'll be happy to. I'll be posting some bits from PM's mostly, and do my best to keep them short for easy digestion. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>SO.</p><p>This's already being told from others' perspectives. I'm going to focus on Derek.</p><p>I'll admit, I had a bit of a rough start. I read Derek's motive and was completely not thrilled. A matchmaker who is fine with being alone? Uhh... okay. Hmm.... I acknowledged that in the right hands that could be hilarious, but not so much mine. So I thought about it some and came to the following conclusion - Derek tells himself he's okay with being alone because he is asexual, and no one has ever been happy being in a relationship with him because of this. So he works really hard to make everyone else happy and keeps telling himself he is okay. This made for a nice cheerful bundle of hidden angst, and something I could work with, heh. It seemed natural that this desire to help those around him be happy should make him very much a white knight. And then I built the rest of his personality in a way that begged to be engaged, and to engage everything - a soldier who is done with war, and wishes for peace, who takes everyone at face value and assumes the best of everyone until proven otherwise - a stubbornly happy idiot with a habit of declaring himself to be vigilant unless kittens. Because kittens. But no need to worry, because no kittens aboard the vessel!</p><p>I tried hard to do the matchmaker angle but it's not one that comes naturally to me, and I seemed to pick the wrong people to engage on it. I wrote up a really dopey romance personality quiz <a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/osm8X1P">that only Hua ever responded to</a> despite directly sending it to a handful of people. So I pretty much gave up on that route, since no one was biting and it didn't fit well with me anyways.</p><p>I thought for sure Derek's good nature and eager boy scout attitude would get him taken advantage of, but Stephen was the only one who ever did, using Derek as a <a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/a/4FkcY">human lab rat</a>. Because really, <em>someone</em> needed to test the acid.</p><p>Oh, wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.</p><p>I had some<a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/a/vsP3l"> absolutely brilliant</a> interactions with Janice early on. I adored the way her thoughts contradicted with what she said. I had begun wondering whether or not NERON and Janice had swapped personalities, but Derek just thought that she was a very nice lady. I was very sad when you had to quit, Cela, and not just because you and Chun were the only ones I'd managed to solidly engage with at that point.</p><p>You <em>may</em> have caught the bit in there were Derek declares Jin Su to not be a rapist. Yeah... that happened. Chun started the ship afraid and vulnerable, so Derek decided he would befriend her and calm her. She mentioned that Jin Su had been giving her drugs that made her forget and... well... he was very good at leaping to conclusions. After many misunderstandings and Chun attempting to stab Jin Su, things settled down. Derek was determined to never doubt Jin Su ever again and redoubled his devotion. Jin Su charged Derek with protecting Chun. Meanwhile, Chun became increasingly infatuated, but Derek kept failing to notice, until she got <a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/br4SR7N">so obvious that even Derek couldn't fail to realize</a>. But he was convinced that she only wanted him physically, and he wasn't interested in that. So... he ran away!</p><p>A bit before this, Derek had gotten drunk and stumbled upon room logs to suggest that Kuan Ti, who had previously pledged friendship to Derek, was probably a mush. <span class="tid_strike">Not one to jump to conclusions</span> Always one to jump to conclusions, regardless of what he kept saying, Derek's response was to tell Kuan Ti he knew. And in so doing, <a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/a/I6uIJ">he met Lucy the friendly mush and spilled his guts to her.</a> Turns out, mush consciousness is separate from host consciousness. Who knew? <a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/a/fNsoj">After speaking with Kuan Ti,</a> Derek embraced Lucy's offer of friendship and asked her ALL the questions. She accepted him in his weirdness and he took her at face value and they became close. She even encouraged him to try things with Chun - after all, he'd never know if Chun really wanted to get to know him if he kept running away from her.</p><p>So after avoiding Chun for a day or so, Derek decided to broach the subject of a relationship with her... but she needed to know that he wasn't interested in sex. He obsessed about how to tell her and in the end, <a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/S1fDpAd">blurted it out terribly, and publicly</a>. Chun rejected him and began drinking heavily.</p><p>Meanwhile, Derek cried on Lucy's shoulder for a bit and then realized - Lucy accepted him. Well and truly. And cared about him. And she amazed him. She was kind and patient and wise, and reminded him of being a boy staring up at the stars in the night sky.... only the stars were talking back. So he told her, and what followed, well, Artie first described it as Unicorn Vomit. Seems about right. Suffice it to say, it was a love match. Quite possibly my favorite RP on mush to date, and I enjoyed it even more for the fact that it didn't get physical beyond cuddles and hugs, but was very deep. Eventually, Lucy became sad that Derek would die and be gone, while she would live on in the mush consciousness without him. So, of course, being the white knight that he is and very much in love, Derek got mushed.</p><p>Except, well, the mush companion he got wasn't quite what he bargained for....</p><p><em>I'm too <span class="tid_strike">lazy</span> tired to finish this right now. Part 2 to come later if people are interested. ^^; </em></p>

                <p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/terrence.png" alt=":mush_terrence_50:" class="tid_ico"><br>hey. my motive was to not believe in mush and just assume sdf is creating artificial chaos. I of course took to another level and declared that so called mush is human made infection to manipulate the masses, making them more obedient upon infection. second idea was to fall in love with Janice. That did not work out. <br>To be honest was not sure what was happening in the front ship throughout the whole trip as I did not want to mess up my RP with suddenly believing in mush. spent first 10 days not doing anything, standing in RC (otherwise we would have had nothing to do in the later days <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> )<br>however, what is with those people? they keep talking about mush, Andie, curious sdf tried collecting data on me, I confused her. Only Gioele, old man, artefact seeker and Raluca, the silent mush-paranoid conservative did a great job, finishing Pilged. Ian did well, doing some useful research, then he, apparently got influenced by the atmospheric chaos started working in useless mush research. silly man, as long as you have a strong will, like terrence, even fungus won't be able to influence your behaviour. therefore I locked lab access as soon as Janice lost grip on reality and spaced out while space. Looked through Chuns novel, decent writing, she should get published. a bit incompetent girl, but I understand all that violence towards SDF. I suspected her, on par with Frieda to be responsible for nicking my bottle opener. The ship won't fix itself, ladies. Stephen was adding the extra sauce to the mush paranoia, he scram and shouted, I didn't care mush after I locked the lab, he switched to the scanning instantly, if he only wasn't so obsessed with mush, we could have got along. separate confused part, devoted to Derek, almost got me develop warm feeling towards him, he helped me, he actually worked on important stuff like nexus and fixing ship. shame he had to take Paola from me, it would have worked out for us, she had a passion towards science, but Derek was too much influence in the front ship, he took her from me. moreover he started talking about mainstreaming mush and lost his charm after starting the split personality trend. On top of that...was it him, who made <em>turrance</em>? ¬_¬ hmmm. didn't interact much with the others, well, probably didn't worth it, none of them have volunteered to help me with the drone works, the guys who contributed a lot towards ship maintenance. I am here, stating that space travel is a dangerous thing for people that are not mentally prepared, the amount of psychological problems that evaluated during this trip was bigger than my sadness when Gioele died. That guy, swear he would have staid sane, like me. To conclude, I successfully finished this trip with those people, we didn't even kill each-other, although I tempted to punch some of them several times. hopefully they will all regain their senses on motheland sol and reflect on the trip with a smile. I even left my e-mail address in the nexus database, so i could be contacted again when they do.</p>
