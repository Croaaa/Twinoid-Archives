Ian wanted to use the scooter to find the pots and get his garden in order, but Andie refused to drop it because she wanted to wait to search for the mush sample hunt. Refusing to acknowledge that we had 3 folks on board and the mush sample wouldn't appear for many many many hours, she stubbornly held onto it. Not to mention how she held the knife from ship start until day 9 or so. That was the main issue with the ship, Andie did what she wanted and she was always right.</p><p>Back on the game front, Stephen became a prime mush suspect because he had one skill, opportunist, and kept talking to us about his imminent apprenticeship skill. But why did you take the least helpful skill, Stephen? Oh, so you've uninstalled all the cameras and transferred into me. Ok, that explains it.</p><p>A third mush popped up around the time of the transfer so paranoia was on. Andie stabbed people. We had to have her do it because the knife was part of her hand. She killed Gioele for some reason and he was Mush. So that was luck.</p><p>A few days later, with only a few unconfirmed humans remaining, the suspicion fell on Terrence for being the most likely conversion target. However I passed through the CBT one day and noticed that Derek had gone in and out of the room many time to drain the scooter. Derek was promptly killed and we were mush free (later we used the serum on Roland to be certain)</p><p>All through these days the main chat was filled with full blown fights between crew members. Generally people yelling at Andie for being difficult. Then Terrence lost his mind briefly and got really really really angry that we'd suspected him, but that must have been some sort of space disease because he soon regained his head.</p><p>I've never experience such an angry ship. Even the final moments were filled with tension as Andie insisted she had used her mission to research and I pointed out that I got pop-ups when missions were accepted. Suddenly I was a bad guy for questioning her honesty and was told I was useless. All in all, I think I did a fine job adjusting to my new body and keeping the ship from falling apart. It's especially difficult to care about a ship when its all tension and rage, but we managed to hang together and make day 11!</p><p>Some things that helped us survive amid the rage:</p><p>-Janice going inactive on the bridge. The combo of heals as she starved and the sofa gave folks a much needed place for morale during the mush hunt when sleeping together wasn't a safe option.</p><p>-Personally, the fact that I was forced into a body with maxed morale saved me the trouble of ever being in danger suicide.</p><p>-The fact that Chun was played by an apparent professional diplomat (she told me she actually worked in customer service) who was able to defuse so much of the tension. She calmed Andie a number of times, calmed the ship towards Andie, and most importantly, she single handedly talked Terrence off the edge when he was contemplating space suicide!</p><p>This ship was an experience...</p>

                <p>Ian here,</p><p>This ship was frustrating as hell. If the mush hadn't been so terrible they could have easily had their way with us.</p><p>One of the main frustrations was Andie. I don't have time to detail it all but some highlights were:<br> - For a long while we suspected Terrence was a beta mush, turns out he had been confiding in Andie everyday and Andie didn't feel that was worth sharing. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"><br> - Turns out our last mush was Derek, who had also been confiding in Andie on occasion. Apparently Andie doesn't find repeating actions like lying down suspicious.<br> - Taking it upon himself to kill Gioele, an inactive, without consulting anyone. We could have traded him.<br>If it hadn't been for the (way too early) food testing, Andie would have been killed off early on.</p><p>Another big frustration was the constant arguing. Things got rather nasty more than a few times and Andie and Stephen argued from start to finish.</p><p>And then their was the mush hunt thread. It was shameful how terrible that thread was, and I resent it's very existence. Very few logical arguments were made, and it was constantly getting derailed with nonsense. It thankfully died (I think) after being abandoned during an argument (the one good thing to come from that)</p><p>Aside from those things we did last a good while longer than I would have anticipated and there were some great players on board. Chun was extremely helpful and if it hadn't been for her relays research would have been greatly hampered. Terrence kept us supplied with scrap and left us with a rather strong hull before being steel plated. Stephen was great, doing a wonderful job despite being the body switch. That said this ship has convinced me to swear off random ships for a while.</p>

                <p>Andie and I argued at lot for sure, but there was a long break in there where we more or less got along. I never broke down to the point of swearing at her, so that felt like a victory.</p><p>I've run into a number of humans who have decided to do their own thing on a ship and food test early as a way to avoid murder. It's a shame that we can't all agree as a ship to roleplay a murder. Speaking of roleplaying, I get that it isn't mandatory or anything, but if someone's going to spend the trip rebelling against authority then perhaps Andie is the last character he or she should play.</p>
