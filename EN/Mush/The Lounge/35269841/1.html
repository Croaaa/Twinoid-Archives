And at the beginning, a couple of things went rather well: We got extra hydropots soon, found tha plasma shield not long after, and I was looking forward to a long game with a glorious garden of 10 plants actually making us gain oxygen.</p><br><p>But oh, the crew! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>There were a few pleasant surprises, like a really competent <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/wang_chao.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_WC:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chao</strong>, who successfully questioned and killed the mushy <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/eleesha_williams.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_EW:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Eleesha</strong> on day 2. Others, however, seemed to be moving a bit but then did nothing useful. And most of all, appeared to have left the cryosleep mute and deaf.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/gioele_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_GR:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Gio</strong> was truly inactive, so we wasted no energy on trying to communicate with him. But them... <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/paola_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_PR:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Paola</strong> kinda hung around the refectory for 2 days, eating, fixing the microwave (!), and doing everything but her job. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/terrence_archer.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_TA:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Terrence</strong> the not-technician random walked to the Nexus and did his best to finish the Sink before the (already started) Hydropots. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/raluca_tomescu.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RT:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Raluca</strong> stood in a bay looking at the ships for a couple of days, then proceeded to the engine to marvel at that, but not repair it once. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/kim_jin_su.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_KJS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Jin Su</strong> gave a talk to 2 people, then looked out of the front window... and no amount of private messages or shouting their names in general chat would reach them.</p><p>(EDIT: Forgot about <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/zhong_chun.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_ZC:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chun</strong>, who was the best at this. Details below.)</p><br><p>After a long while, most of those were kinda sorted. Just when we were about to blast her, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/paola_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_PR:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Paola</strong>'s job was eventually passed on to <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/stephen_seagull.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_SS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Stephen</strong>, who was ready and willing to gung-ho the Comms terminal just in time for the D3 base. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/wang_chao.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_WC:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chao</strong> "visited" the others in turn, or they eventually starved, and inactive <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/kim_jin_su.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_KJS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Jin Su</strong> turned out to be our second <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Mush</strong>. We also got lucky with an early O2 planet, which should be all we ever need thanks to the plants (no alien ones though <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">), and our pilots <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/jiang_hua.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JH:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Hua</strong> and <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/frieda_bergmann.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FB:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Frieda</strong> raked in lots of scrap metal.</p><br><p>But then, around day 6, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/raluca_tomescu.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RT:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Raluca</strong> finally died as well, after some more zombielike shambling... and we realized that we had a problem: With no physicist technician, <em>there was nobody left to repair Pilgred!</em> Except for us untrained scrubs, repairing it 1% at a time!</p><p>Faced with such an ordeal, we set up the most awesome plan to achieve a most mediocre ending: We calculated how long this would take us, and found that it could work, but we would have to ration our AP and cut any unneeded activity, with everyone helping, for a chance of all of us getting home alive!</p><p>So we moved everything and everyone to the back of the ship, piling the plants and other gear in rear corridor, and prepared to get to it.<br>...which would have worked better if people did things like use the empty beds, or use the thread which we put up for organizing relays rather than walking to the engine and back for every 1%. But you know, that would mean reading...<br>So basically half the crew was happily wasting AP in spite of the situation, while <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/janice_kent.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JK:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Janice</strong> and I watched everyone's chances dwindle (in a constant blaze of fires everywhere), in spite of our best efforts.<br>Only <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/frieda_bergmann.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FB:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Frieda</strong>, who had been active and helpful before, did not get out of bed anymore one day. And starved there.</p><p>After that blow, it was clear that we really had to get our shit together now, if we wanted to be done before being buried under piles of falling metal! It was day 10 or such, and people were already hurting, with Pilgred at 60%.</p><p>- <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/finola_keegan.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FK:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Finola</strong>, who had been reluctant to abandon her glory-only research before, reacted promptly, by standing right in our main hub in RC and trying the Infernal Kube a dozen times. Yes.<br>After a short discussion, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/wang_chao.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_WC:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chao</strong> shot her. Which cost us morale ingame, but arguably raised it (back from the depths this caused) a bit IRL.</p><br><p>But now we were <em>really</em> fighting an uphill battle. With tempers going up, and crewmembers still seeming to be doing everything, in troll-like proportions, to make it more difficult (like <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/lai_kuan_ti.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_LKT:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> who was helping but at the same time wasting others' points by not sharing what he did or knew, people generally not reading, acting before talking, repairing unimportant equipment next to a drone, or doing stuff like not using the beds because other rooms allegedly had "less falling metal"...), it was a tough time.</p><p>Long story short - we made it. Baaarely.<br>On day 12, two cycles after the time we had planned (for an utopian case in which everyone would use beds and show up), with both O2 tanks leaking and metal raining from the sky, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/janice_kent.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JK:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Janice</strong>, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/wang_chao.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_WC:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chao</strong> and I fixed the damn thing in the back of a broken, smoking ship that had just been hit by 2 asteroids, and got the few survivors home. - Except for <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/stephen_seagull.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_SS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Stephen</strong>, who was plated one cycle before. RIP.</p><br><p>But man... while I am sure that this would definitely not have ended so well without us sometimes shouting at people, for now I am just happy it is over. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>Next time, I am going to pick a peaceful role, with little responsibility, like gardening.</p><p>Oh, wait...</p>

                <p>Janice here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">. According to all the technician work I did in this game maybe would have been better if I was born as Terrence (though crew could be sad about it with his starvation dying <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> ). Just for interest I calculated it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> : 39% on Plasma Shield, 24% Pilgred, 4 O2 tanks, well and 1 door.</p><p>We were quite lucky with mushes - Eleesha acted quite strange from the begining, after I asked her a couple of questions she started to act even more strange. And after it was the first time when I saw REAL CHAO with torture <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">!!! Jin Su was one of inactives which I checked for health later - he was the only one who didn't loose it (Raluca was still alive). Ian, you could have been tortured also before Jin Su was found - Chao almost did that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">, you didn't work in Lab the first 2 days on Gas and Alarms (me and Kuan, which read science book reseted Finola), you took Apron from Lab 3 times, you cooked food for people checked to be people and after that you ate ration before pill "by mistake" after the... well, you should remember <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>In my utopian first calculated plan we were able to finish Pilgred in the middle of Day 10 <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> - if Frieda ate and healed in time and didn't die, Finola healed someone or worked on Pilgred instead of solving that cube and Kuan didn't run too much and told us what he is doing and where he checked for the fire. Frieda woke up every day - it's just smth fell on her and room shaked and I suppose she just started starving maybe for a cycle or 2, bad Finola was solving cube at that time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">. And BTW Ian, it finally was better to make the Net than if we worked on those Sprinklers, don't know why didn't you believe your Neron specialist at first <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>In the whole - it was my longest, hardest, one of the best trips but a little monotonous :/. No new planets, no alien fruits etc. Though it may become one of the most fabulous by making both Plasma Sield and Pilgred without both technician and physics <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.</p>

And if she had not starved eventually, she would even have gotten a good ranking for that. Yeap.</p>
