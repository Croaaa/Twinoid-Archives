                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3891">The Honours List</a></p><p>Your Commander, Jin Su, here. I was really impressed with how enjoyable this game was; like my last one there were few Silver or Gold characters (just Terrence, Paola and I) but some experienced and active players nonetheless.</p><p>This was my first time as Commander and a Pilot, but I've spent enough time on the forums and Wiki to have gotten used to it easily enough. Fortunately we had another three Pilots so Hunters were never a serious threat and Scrap was reasonably plentiful - two Sofas, a Lizaro, an extra Drone, two Turbo upgrades, a Babel Module and a few hull repairs all built.</p><p>Unfortunately our Janice went inactive after burning through her AP with the MAD Kube, and by the time Stephen was eventually able to Solid her into the Dorm she starved or demoralised the next cycle. There was some trouble getting people to stay in the right place for my speeches but fortunately Gioele formulated the titular Rinaldo Co. Team Building initiative. Having spent the entire game flirting with everything in sight, Kuan Ti eventually got to do the Sofa tango with Raluca. Gioele also got Raluca to himself, then Eleesha not long afterwards.</p><p>Despite Andie's protests I had us risk the ~12% chance of hitting one of the two (out of twelve total) Seismic zones and getting a Death event. "Never tell me the odds", and our first loss was Ian. It was not in vain however, because Polyvalent Andie combined with our Babel Module bagged us a Starmap Fragment!</p><p>I found out that Eleesha was an awesome investigator from the professional state of her Mush hunting chat, having been added along with Terrence from expedition illnesses. Fortunately Eleesha had completed the MycoAlarms in time to catch Andie infecting Schroedinger - she was quickly knifed. As her death message warned, we were left without any Research bonuses so we didn't get much more done.<br>I also turned out to be a dab hand at Mush hunting, although as usual hesitation caused us harm: after I noticed the Bridge Camera had to have been Sabotaged and only Paola could have done it, we tried to get her to take out the inactive Derek or work on Comms first. Despite never going Inactive, she managed to not do very much of her job and strike while I was asleep. Chun was Demoralised to death and Gioele had killed Paola, but that was two human deaths according to the tracker. My first worry was that Eleesha had been transferred into, but seeing Gioele suddenly with the Solid skill (and then the logs showing he'd knocked over two Cameras) it was obviously a Transfer to take out another useful player. Stephen and I almost managed to take him out, but after a Mutation and running to attack Raluca, Frieda landed the killing blow before any more death occurred. Unfortunately she'd lost her tongue, and with the above-mentioned Speech confusion she soon suicided, followed by Roland the next day.</p><p>With seven of us left and no threat from Hunters or Mush remaining, the RNG cackled maniacally to itself: setting fire to the Bridge (twice), three turrets, the Lab with our plants, Front Corridor and Front Storage all in the course of two cycles. The Fuel tanks also broke about six times between them in only a few cycles time. Fortunately with some teamwork we managed to finish PILGRED and head back to Sol, but not before Stephen was shaken and plated to death two cycles too early.</p><p>Not that it is particularly important, but my last foray out in a Patrol ship before pushing the Sol button brought me from fourth to first in Glory! Our Top 6 are all in the Top 50 overall for this Season too (found most of the RP crowd that way).</p><p>Alternate thread titles:<br><em>Kuan Ti's Burning Passion<br>Ian Memoriam<br>We need more 'stimulants', Commander<br>Freaky Thursday<br>Raluca's Reproduction Reservations<br>Max Turbo: The Power of Drones<br>Burning Bridges<br>Frequently Fractured Fuel-Tanks</em></p><p>Anyway, I really enjoyed this ship and was fortunate to end up with our confirmed human chat including all the RPers - plenty of innuendo and general mischief to keep us all entertained. Eleesha, Raluca and Terrence (albeit not a serious RPer) get a special thanks, along with Gioele and Ian who left us too soon.<br>Hope to see you in future ships, perhaps the MMM tonight!</p>

                <p>Greetings, employees. Your beloved Mr. Rinaldo Here; Consumer of the Coffee, Builder of the Drones, and Beloved of all Women. I loved all of you guys to peaces: especially Raluca, Jin Su, Eleesha, and Kuan Ti (For roleplaying purposes only)... but I let my RPing get the better of me. I just couldn't bring Gioele to kill his daughter. Then, I step away from the screen for two minutes to use the bathroom and suddenly I'm not me anymore *sad face*. Anyways, I look forward to seeing you all in another timeline, and as one last RP:</p><p>*I hereby bequeth all my worldly possessions, including my 87% stack in Rinaldo Co. to my beloved <span class="tid_strike">daughter </span> beloved adopted-in-spirit daughter Raluca. May she have a long and fruitful carrier in <span class="tid_strike">politics</span> quantum design engineering, <em>and show more people the beauty of th..</em> (Note trails off in blood)</p>

I know I said I would not, even could not do the deed... but she is dead by my own hand. I think I need something stronger than coffee if such a thing is among our supplies."</p><p>Hey! Paola here. First off, great work! I knew you'd at least get to Sol (without the cure), although I hope I at least made it a bit more challenging.</p><p>It was obvious from the start this was a cautious ship, and Andie and I figured on blending in and playing a very patient game, but I don't think Andie's heart was in it, and our Lt. Graham got impatient and acted too quickly, immediately letting the cat out of the bag, so to speak.</p><p>I didn't intend to go AWOL for a couple of days; I really *did* get called away because of business and my WiFi options on the road absolutely sucked. So doing such a bad job of comms wasn't actually a mush strategy, but rather bad luck. I started out as one of your RPers and in another world could have maintained your trust and would have looked for a spectacular way to betray it. Ah, well, next time.</p><p>I made a lot of mistakes as a mush this game but learned a whole bunch about what works and what doesn't, and I think next time I play the villain I will be much more dangerous. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I had my final rampage planned out on paper: the exact routes and actions (and their costs), although I was surprised to find Gioele in the medlab and Chun on the bridge and not the reverse. From tip to tail the plan took about 20 seconds to execute. Looking over my final couple of cycles alive, I realize that my final actions were sub-optimal and I may have been able to take out Stephen or Raluca (or both) if their morale was as bad as I thought it was.</p><p>I know the transfer was obvious, but I hope my last couple of messages were a close enough approximation of Gioele's style that it made it somewhat realistic.</p><p>It was fun; you all made this a memorable ship. Feel free to add me as a contact and maybe we'll put together a casting some day.</p>

                <p>I did see you'd made some pretty good attempts to be Gioele after Transfer, which was part of why I initially suspected it was Eleesha you had went to. It was also because (if I remember correctly) she was acting as though you were always human and had griefer-killed Chun. Probably misunderstood by me at the time, it's usually quite confusing after a rampage.</p><p>Also nice to have Gioele say hi, couldn't find you given your substantially lower glory...</p>

                <p>I was Raluca, and Giole got there first.</p><p>I imagine Raluca goes on to sell Rinaldi Co. in order to fund research and materials for a mass cure, which will be used to slowly bolster the resistance until humanity can stand again. Having seen the treachery of the Mush, and the horror of what they did to his family, she would use every asset she could to assure the resistance that there could be trust at least within its own ranks.</p><p>I'm still reeling over the roleplay on this ship. It's rare that you play one of these and it really feels like a story with a dramatic arc, but this was one. Everyone was simply incredible.</p><p>Paola, your efforts were extremely effective. Without Chun, Janice, Schrodinger, or plants (a fire wiped em out - I forgot before or after your death,) we started bleeding morale fast, and had to cut the journey very short. Excellent strategy, considering Andie's early out.</p>
