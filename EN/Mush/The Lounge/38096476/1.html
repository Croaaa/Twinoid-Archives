                <p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3901" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3901</a></p><p><strong><em>The Setup</em></strong>:<br><strong><em>Mush</em></strong>: <strong>Roland</strong> and <strong>Frieda</strong> (I was Roland, both of us were super active)<br><strong><em>Super Active Humans</em></strong>: <strong>Gioele, Derek, Janice, Paola</strong><br><strong><em>Decent Humans</em></strong>: <strong>Hua, Raluca</strong><br><strong><em>Not Sure What They Were Doing</em></strong>:<strong> Eleesha</strong> (newb), <strong>Stephen</strong> (RP but not active),<strong> Ian</strong> (not really active), <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> (not really active),<strong> Jin Su </strong>(depressed and mostly inactive)<br><strong><em>Grand Inactive</em></strong>s: <strong>Chun, Andie, Terrence</strong> (actually he died in the tutorial due to being Dirty)</p><p>This was a great game. I felt there were enough active humans to make a great play and having an active Mush partner is GREAT. At first I was scared of the updates to Myco Alarms (which I still feel are overpowered, or at least 4 is still too many) but as it turns out, having an active Mush partner goes a LONG way.</p><p>This ended in a <strong><em>Mush Victory via Expedition Abandonment</em></strong> and massacre of the remaining active humans on the ship.</p><p>It started with a strong start to both Mush and Humans. <strong> Frieda</strong> was a high level Mush and got the "1 free spore per day" skill that helped us get a ton of early spores (we were both loaded before either <strong>antispore</strong> or <strong>constipaspore</strong> were done), though I think a lot had to do with the research too. I think the humans focused on myco alarms too early. Sure they are super great now but it meant almost another full day of 2 AP spores and 4 spores per day. Still they were relaying like mad and got myco alarms done in super record time. <strong> Antispore</strong> and <strong>Constipaspore</strong> followed very quickly too.</p><p>Unfortunately<strong> Terrence</strong> didn't make it out of the tutorial and ended up Dirty on the Bridge. <strong>Derek</strong> quickly killed <strong>Terrence</strong>. <strong> Paola</strong> was new to her role but was still mostly active and very helpful. <strong>Gioele</strong> and<strong> Janice</strong> were beasts at research. Another setback for the humans was<strong> Kuan Ti </strong>dismantling the <em>Alpha Dorm</em> shower, asking for the sofa BP, then suddenly going inactive for TWO DAYS holding the tube. If I had been <strong>Derek</strong> I would've just killed him for that alone.</p><p><strong>Mush Frieda</strong> and Human <strong>Gioele</strong> sort of got into it in the beginning but we were still doing a good job of staying under the radar. As <strong>Mush Roland</strong>, I pretended to be only semi-active, able to log in only twice a day or so, using these bursts to do my job at about 85% (I still killed a LOT of Hunters) and then get some Mushy stuff done. It really helped that on the first day <strong>Hua</strong> left one Hunter alive so I couldn't scrap run. I complained about this and<strong> Gioele</strong> told me to just turret it. I love it when people tell me to turret to save AP because it never does. I blew all my free shooter points and spent a couple of AP between TWO turrets and STILL didn't kill the damn Hunter. I said I was out of MP and didn't want to waste more AP moving to yet another turret. The logs would mostly back me up too. I used that to get more spores and shower.</p><p>Now here's the real key when you have a really active Mush partner, you can do amazing things like spore blitz another character at day change. <strong> Frieda</strong> and I arranged to blitz <strong>Raluca</strong> on I believe Day 2 to Day 3 changeover. We both logged in, sat around "AFK" until about 45 seconds to day change. Then we ran to <em>Rear Alpha Turret,</em> "prespored" <strong>Raluca</strong> before day change, then double spored her right after. <strong>Frieda</strong> <strong><em>Defaced</em></strong> the room logs and we got out of there super quick. The best part is we both "woke up" and had business. <strong> Frieda</strong> was loading fuel and I was doing a scrap run. Granted if someone had actually gone in the turret they might have noticed the wiped log but nobody is supposed to go there. Ultimately nobody did so<strong><em> Defacer</em></strong> didn't help us that much, but it was good insurance.</p><p>I also trapped Alpha Bay 2 with a spore and<strong> Gioele</strong> ate it a couple cycles later. I also <strong><em>Anonymushed</em></strong> so it still looked like 2 Mush.</p><p>So we felt really great. With 3 Mush things got really dangerous for the humans. <strong>Raluca </strong>seemed disappointed she was Mush but seemed on board and <strong>Frieda </strong>and I got excited talking about all our awesome plans for whoever sat in the med lab alone (3 Mush plus <strong><em>Defacer</em></strong>.... sorry<strong> MycoAlarms</strong>)</p><p>Then suddenly <strong>Raluca </strong>decided to go to the lab and <strong><em>INFECT</em></strong> the cat in front of a ton of witnesses and a <strong>Myco Alarm</strong>! She then sat there and got killed by <strong>Derek</strong>. It _could_ have been a newb mistake but I honestly think she just Mush suicided because she didn't want to play Mush. I didn't report her because the evidence was circumstancial, but this loss was pretty signficant. We had put a lot of resources into converting her.</p><p><strong>Frieda </strong>and I freaked out for a bit wondering if <strong>Raluca </strong>had tattled on us but ultimately we were fine. At this point O2 was starting to get low and we had only done a wasteful expedition that hurt a lot of people. People really shouldn't do <em>Expeditions</em> on small planets with few chances, especially when 2 (3) Mush are present. We were playing it really cool though because we needed more time to recover from all the <strong>Raluca </strong>wastage. Meanwhile Research was going gangbusters (pretty much all the anti-mush research except the scanner) while NERON was super lacking (dead <strong>Terrence </strong>and <strong>Raluca</strong>, AFK<strong> Kuan Ti</strong>) It also helped to have a barely active <em>Commander</em>. I really wish you had to be a minimum overall or something to play<strong> Jin</strong>. The <em>Commander </em>needs to be really active or it hurts the humans so much. There was a lot of wasted time getting to expos and starting expos because <strong>Jin </strong>wasn't around much to move the ship. <strong>Frieda</strong> got so frustrated she even borrowed the <em>Hacker Kit</em> and moved us with complete approval of the Human contingent!</p><p>Ultimately we had to make a move before the humans panicked and started killing random unconfirmed humans. <strong>Derek</strong>, <strong>Gioele</strong>, <strong>Janice</strong>, <strong>Paola</strong>, and <strong>Hua </strong>had been confirmed human and it seemed like <strong>Frieda </strong>was in a couple conversations where she was being trusted. <strong>Derek </strong>finally killed <strong>Jin Su</strong> since he was dooming the ship and <strong>Gioele </strong>took over. <strong> Ian</strong>, <strong>Stephen</strong>, and <strong>Kuan </strong>to ninja logged in very occasionally and did minimal work, but the sofa finally got made.</p><p>Finally O2 was getting low (11ish) and we HAD to do an O2 expedition. <strong>Frieda </strong>found a sweet planet and we arrived. <strong>Frieda </strong>and I both planned our AFKs so we wouldn't be able to join the expedition. Even then it took FOREVER because <strong>Hua </strong>wasn't super active. We were gnashing our teeth in frustration. Finally it got moving with <strong>Hua</strong>, <strong>Derek</strong>, and <strong>Janice </strong>in the expedition and we decided 2.5 active humans was a good objective.</p><p><strong>Frieda </strong>grabbed the <em>Hacker Kit</em> (it wasn't even hidden!) and then in her haste and panick almost screwed it up (oh it also helped that <strong>Hua </strong>preloaded fuel before the expedition, though I was ready to do so). She also posted in general chat instead of our personal chat about sporing and we knew the jig was up. Somehow though we got the ship underway and abandoned the poor expedition to their doom. Since I had a full bar and a blaster I decided to pay a visit to <strong>Gioele </strong>and personally executed him. Since spores seemed useless at this point I picked up <strong><em>Phagocyte </em></strong>(so did <strong>Frieda</strong>) and we went and killed the last truly active player <strong>Paola </strong>in the <em>medlab</em>.</p><p>THEN WE NAPPED and chatted for like an hour working off the victory rush. Honestly it was the longest I've lived as a Mush post big play. There were 2 fires, stuff was broken, the O2 was running out and our Hull was at 20. And here we were watching the whole world burn down. It was possible <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> might wake up and SOMEHOW relay with someone else suddenly going active, so we decided to jump him after we had recovered some AP.</p><p>Then the whole thing turns Benny Hill. We head to <em>Bravo Dorm</em> and<strong> Kuan Ti </strong>wakes up AT THE SAME TIME. Apparently he didn't really read chat because he immediately grabs an extinguisher and tries to put out a fire. He also noticed Dirty <strong>Frieda </strong>and finally read chat (<strong>Frieda </strong>had posted an apology, she meant ration when she said spore...) and tried to hit <strong>Frieda </strong>once. Then <strong>Frieda </strong>and I both hit him a couple of times and he ran off to eat a ration. We were both out of AP so slept in <em>Bravo Dorm</em> when <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> returned. And I swear I STILL don't understand but he was honestly confused about what was going on. SOMEHOW <strong>Frieda </strong>semi-conviced him <strong>Eleesha </strong>did everything and he started hitting <strong>Eleesha </strong>while we were both laughing privately. He started getting angry about Dirty people and wanted someone to go to the bridge to read the logs. It was hilarious. We were saving up AP but <strong>Stephen </strong>finally woke up, checked the logs and came down to kill <strong>Frieda</strong>, ignoring me completely. He chased <strong>Frieda </strong>to<em> Alpha Bay</em> where she took off in a patrol ship.</p><p>And then... it was over. I lay there in <em>Bravo Dorm</em> next to a sleeping <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> and clueless <strong>Eleesha </strong>as the ship shook apart from fires and Hunter hits feeling pretty good. <strong>Frieda </strong>and I had served the Mush well, and the <strong><em>Daedalus</em></strong> was done.</p><p>Shout out to the active Human players, you tried really hard and it was scary. We didn't have TOO many super inactives but a grand inactive researcher, semi-inactive <em>Commander</em> and <strong>Chun</strong> is REALLY bad. If <strong>Raluca</strong> had actually played you guys were doomed. Nice try though, hope to see you guys in another ship!</p><p>And to old<strong> Frieda</strong>. Good job out there. While I go down with the burning ship maybe a Hunter will pick you up and take you to Mushland for medals and Mush rewards. Hail Mush!</p>

                <p>Derek here. <br>Yeah, once Chun goes inactive, the ship is hard to protect. Even having a confirmed human hold the Kit, doesn't make it safe. A MUSH can use transfer on them (or the commander at the time) and move the ship. To be really safe, you need to hold the kit and set up guards. Yes, more than one, or two MUSH can still kill you, by transferring into both the one with the hacker kit and the one guarding. Heck, they can also just kill Chun and grab the kit, so you're never really safe from this move.</p><p>Truth be told, a lot of people suspected Frieda. Not just Gioele. However, so many other people became more suspicious, and we fell into the 'Hope an inactive is the MUSH' trap. We hoped that Raluca was Alpha and Kuan Ti was the second.</p><p>I did NOT suspect Roland at all. You did your job, and stayed quiet. Or at least noone could spend the time to check if you did your job.</p><p>I have to say, you both did an excellent job. It's not like you just did nothing either, since you converted Raluca. We just missed it with having to deal with holding the ship together.</p>

                <p>Which one were you? This was just my point of view so if you did stuff and not in my presence I may not have noticed. Feel free to contribute!</p><p>Also upon more thinking I think I've figured out what happened with the Benny Hill Kuan Ti. I entered Bravo Bay while Frieda was in the Rear Corridor. Kuan Ti wakes up, goes to RC to get the extinguisher and hits Frieda once because of her sporing comment. Then he reads the apology reply, believes it?! and goes to put out a fire. Then Frieda and I hit him a couple times before he runs while Frieda is yelling at him to stop, she's not the Mush.</p><p>I'm guessing at that point he's really confused and assumes I'm defending Frieda and since there's only one Mush left (on screen) maybe Frieda is okay? Then gets convinced Eleesha is bad and starts hitting her while Frieda and I sit there out of AP?</p><p>Honestly I'm still not sure. It was hilarious though.</p>

                <p>He was Stephen. He was active early on, but stopped later on.</p><p>The real problem, is that the ones who were really active, had to cover for the non-covered jobs, and thus we couldn't really do any MUSH hunting.</p><p>Really, our key inactives killed us. (That and the MUSH actually being smart and waiting for a key time to strike.) No active Chun/Ian/Andie meant a lack of research. We managed to get it going later, but we didn't have anyone really heading it to start with.

Not only did I have to spend time killing him, but it also was a huge distraction, since we thought he might be carrying out an act.

Yeah, that helps.)</p><p>(Also, I'd like to point out, that Derek being abandoned on a planet with Janice and Hua, isn't the worst thing for him...)</p>

You guys got a tremendous amount of research done despite Chun and Andie being inactive. I think what screwed you the most was Jin Su.

                <p>Gioele here. It's too bad that I wasn't free on the day you Mush decided to go berzerk. I was out for the whole day and when I logged back, I was truly confused as to who was Mush and who wasn't. And what happened to our Human team.</p><p>After reading the OP, it's becoming clearer what happened.</p><p>Let me recollect my thoughts a bit:<br>1. Things started off pretty slowly and I was beginning to think this was going to be one of the those boring ships. The only fun was Derek role-playing his character cheesily which was entertaining.</p><p>2. I was suspicious that Roland failed to kill that one Hunter. I even went to check at Centre Bravo Turret and he did shoot at the Hunter but didn't deplete the charges. Since we were so low on pilots, I didn't push it.</p><p>3. Some time later, Janice become active. That's when we really started to roll quickly. By that time, it was Day 2. We had to decide on what to research. We felt it better to start mycoalarms ~ partly cos' Frieda was annoying the heck out of me on not choosing paranoid. Practically though, I was quite sure we could finish AGS on that day itself too. It was a given that the Mush would have spored 4 times on D2 as well when we started research, so AGS had a lower priority vs. mycoalarms. Contatispore was something that had to wait.</p><p>4. With Janice and me relaying, we finished up a huge amount of anti-mush research. The only problem was Jin Su holding us up by not moving the ship. On hindsight, we should have killed him faster. He was semi-active, which made us waste time giving him a chance.</p><p>5. By the time we killed him, we started one expo which was semi-ok. We quickly went on to the next one since we were running low on O2. We killed Raluca, so I really thought there was only one mush left. It didn't occur to me to double check whether she was a Beta mush.</p><p>6. Unfortunately, I had to leave the game when that expo was about to start. It didn't help that I announced it publicly, but I thought we'd have enough members to watch out for the expo. I should have guarded the Front Corridor on hindsight, but I'm surprised none of the expo members thought of bringing the Hacker kit together in the expo by dropping it at Icarus Bay. Bad mistake.</p><p>Derek, Janice ~ I really enjoyed this ship with you guys.</p><p>Frieda ~ I was suspicious of you from the start, but it didn't help that Kuan Ti was semi active and mushlike. We didn't have enough active astros and I didn't want to push it.</p><p>Roland ~ good job. I didn't suspect you at all except in the beginning where you said you spent everything on the turret. With shooter, you'd only spend 4ap emptying both turrets, so plainly you were lying. Too bad I didn't pick up on that.</p><p>Rgds</p>

                <p>I was worried about that one Hunter too. I thought I would kill it then have to go on a scrap run. In the first Turret there were only 3 charges. In the 2nd turret I used all charge and STILL didn't kill it. I didn't think I said I used all my AP, I basically said I was out of MP and didn't want to waste AP moving to yet another turret to miss 4 times. Thinking back it was kind of a weak argument, but I thought the logs would back me up pretty well and I was "frustrated" wasting time on your advice. After I wasted all my shooter points and a couple APs though it was easy to spore up and go back to sleep and "not be able to log back in for hours" till the Raluca blitz.</p><p>Still annoyed about that. I got you with a Trap Spore but we wasted all other spores and actions on Raluca who then suicided. Then you guys got Mushovore so fast and there was no easy way to get you anymore without blitzing again which is WAY riskier in a dorm.</p><p>Also did you get heals? I thought people said you took a lot of damage from the first expo but it took me so many hits to kill you. &gt;&lt;</p>

                <p>He said he was tapped out of AP so we didn't want to trust a transfer into an empty character.</p><p>Our main plan was to see if the Hacker's Kit was still there and use that. If someone had grabbed and hidden it I or Frieda would have transferred into Gioele, hoping he had enough AP to get to the bridge and move.

                <p>Ah ~ RNG wasn't kind to you on turret shooting. Usually it takes about 4 tries to kill a Hunter but I guess you lucked out.</p><p>I was really out of AP. Spent a lot of it on research, loading in fuel and moving the ship.</p><p>No ~ I didn't get heals but I had 10hp. I didn't go on that expo. Hua, Derek, Janice and one other went, I think.</p><p>I think the Hacker Kit was an oversight. Should have dropped it at Icarus Bay, since no one can get in whilst an expo is underway.</p>
