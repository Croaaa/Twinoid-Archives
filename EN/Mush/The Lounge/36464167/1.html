                <p><em>"Hello Crew. I've returned from my Piano lesson. Regrettably, my purpose is not to launch the expedition, it is in fact to launch to Sol. You all have done absolutely fantastically, and if it weren't for Raluca and I being as cautious as we were, I have no doubt this would've turned out exactly the same as most other MMM ships. Unfortunately for you, we were very, very cautious. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Do not feel dismayed, as you feel it taking over your minds and souls. It is but a new birth! Join me in the new birth of humanity, and the celebration of our Mush Lords."</em></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2977">I am Jin, in case you hadn't noticed.</a></p><p>So. This was an MMM ship, by the way, for all you readers. The fight begun D1C2, when Chao was the last person to unfreeze himself after shaking off the icicles of... unnamed substance. I gave a speech to fourteen people in Medbay, giving the largest speech I've ever given. Gotta say, it was one of Jin Su's few very inspiring speeches. It was at that moment that I knew I'd be <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">, simply because there was no way I'd be human on such a fantastic ship of people.</p><p>Not long later, my fears were confirmed. I was an agent of Mush. But, Raluca was my partner. Raluca, dear dear Raluca. Physicist and Tech, she was a eureka. And it was the perfect Jin Su Raluca pairing that every Mush pair hopes for. So there was hope. Of course, like almost every MMM ship, this one was incredibly hyper active and one wrong move would spell death for an unfortunate Mush. Hence why my heart caught in my throat when Raluca told me she'd extracted her spore count for the day, but didn't get caught for it...</p><p>Day 1 passed mostly uneventfully. We planned for what we would do. We knew a Eden victory was impossible. Active Eleesha and a really fierce mush hunting crew would prevent that. Our best bet was rush Sol victory, and the entire time I was very scared that one of the crew members would ask me to eat a ration so I could go hunt pilots with more efficiency. Trying to dodge reasonable human requests while conserving AP for our final move was really difficult.</p><p>Day two came around, we got a starmap fragment from a lucky alien encounter, and steaks, and lovely stuff. PILGRED was already up at 30% around, so we were close enough to our goal to do it. I rested up in a bed until cycle seven (I slept in a lot longer than I intended) and had to move the ship. Our plan would begin Cycle eight.</p><p>Cycle eight came, I got out of my piano lesson, and I immediately charged down towards the rear of the ship under pretense of launching expo. I instead went to engine room. One minute felt like thirty minutes as I relayed for her three times, heart pounding in my throat the whole time because everyone on the ship was active at the time, and all it would take would be for someone to guard front corridor in time and our shot would be over.</p><p>No one stopped me on the way up though. PILGRED completed without a hitch, and Frieda was the only one who noticed something was wrong before I was in bridge room, and by then it was too late because I was already in front corridor. Arrived, gave the ending speech above, and so ends the first of the MMM ships.</p><p>I am really sorry about the abrupt ending to what would have otherwise been a fantastic ship, but it is the job of a Mush to do such things.</p>

One second he was in the rear of the ship the next second at the front and we had jumped, Literally leaving us no chance to act.</p><p>It was NOT amazing in any way it was Easy, cheap, and without creativity.</p>

                <p>I wasn't on this shipbut,<br>well I see some butthurt ppl in this thread so my opinion: It's a valid Mush tactic (you don't have to like it), I think this is a better plan than to suicide bomb yourself and do as much damage as possible and as some ppl said before: It takes luck, coordination and incompetence on the side of the humans to get away with it. Normally you keep an eye onto Raluca until she's confirmed Human. And if you have a very active ship (given on an MMM ship) you can stop them before they can get through with it, one easy possibility would be to let at least stay 2 ppl stay in the engine room BEFORE you start an expo, or even better: let Raluca use all her Ap until she's confirmed human, so she won't have the working power to finish PILGRED with her partner.</p>

                <p>I was Janice in the ship. Just some comments:<br>- Both mush acted completely human. Raluca helped finish Plasma shield on day 1. Jin Su steered the ship to Frieda's planets in a very timely manner. He joined the first expedition without any complaint. Not a single person was spored in the ship. No important items were hidden. No equipments sabotaged.<br>- Mush tests were banned in the ship. People overreacted when Chao did the banana/pill test. Several players scolded Terrence for posting a screenshot of his chat screen (verifying that he's human).<br>- With mush tests being strongly prohibited and mush not doing anything mushy, it was near impossible for humans to tell which members were mush. It was only day 2 when the ship finished so it would have been silly for Eleesha to print her list, and Finola's list from xyloph DB was completely useless. Only suspicious thing about Jin Su was refusing to launch the expeditions because he wanted to save his ap for hunters. Raluca felt a little too quiet for me but there were much quieter players (IMO) like Hua, Stephen and Roland.<br>- Pilgred was only 26% (?) before both Jin Su and Raluca rushed-finish it (Raluca was a physicist + Tech), so even if someone checked Pilgred's progress the same cycle the game ended, this still wouldn't have raised any suspicion. I also think both Raluca and Jin Su finished Pilgred in under 3 minutes. Someone (Kuan Ti?) actually purchased Actopi Protocol so I did see Jin Su staying in the Engine Room with Raluca. I assumed that he was there because he was loading fuel to exit orbit after the expedition. It never crossed my mind that they were finishing Pilgred, and less than 1 minute after Pilgred was completed, we were already in Sol. It would have been preventable if somebody guarded the front corridor, but I think less than 1 minute is too short of a notice.</p>

                <p>Hey, another moderately paranoid MMM3&amp;4 jumper.</p><p>Lots of lessons to be learned here, even though the perfect combo (active Jin alpha + active Ral Alpha with at least silver) will only ever show up, statistically, in less than 1/240 ships (holy cow, RNGesus please spare the next MMM this repeat horror story). (or is it 1/120 ships? my math is probably off, but it's really unlucky)</p><p>1) <strong>Actively knock off or corner the most important roles re: early mush Sol</strong> - Your first expedition should be teeming with catchable diseases if at all possible, preferably ones (Insects / Forest) where the character's name is indicated in the expedition log. Also, make sure that you start the expos with plenty of time left before cycle change and have the medkit in icarus bay to immediately ambush the "alleged" disease with a heal that generates a public log. (alternatively they'll be vomitting on the floor after the trip). That means convincing <strong>Raluca</strong> to be the 4th crew in the ship, even though it might cripple your expedition gains. If she adamantly refuses then it's a sign that the noose should draw tighten on restricting her actions.</p><p>2) <strong>Be very wary of "pilot" Jins on a monthly ship</strong> - Just because he "can" go out there to shoot hunters doesn't mean he <em>must</em>. You'll have at least 2 dedicated pilots to bear that burden, more than enough for the first two days.</p><p>3) <strong>Pilgred is a trap!</strong> - You heard it right here, 28 -&gt; 100% in 3 minutes with, likely, a 1% contributing Jin. Just because you think you're gonna get that yummy coffee by Day 4, doesn't mean you should risk the entire journey for it.</p><p>4) <strong>Super paranoia time</strong> - If you're not satisfied with the above, you can always ask Chun (or any other verified human) to be guarding front corridor at the start of a cycle where your commander has an excuse to leave for the back of the ship from bridge.</p><p>5) <strong>RNG is king</strong> - Like i mentioned before, this pocket aces combo only shows up 1/16 x 1/15th of alpha mush start permutations. Sometimes you just gotta fold when the random numbers are being cruel. (EDIT: I just looked up the Hold'em odds of drawing pocket aces, 1/220, PRETTY DARN CLOSE to the Jin + Ral combo)</p>

If Jin has shooter, it makes him infinitely more efficient at killing hunters than Hua, thus making the ideal hunter killer team Roland and Jin Su rather than Roland and Hua. Hua scraps. Jin Su doesn't have a terribly huge amount of stuff to do with his AP otherwise, he gives the occasional speech, moves the ship, and returns to Sol when necessary. He's also one of the few pilots with shooter point possibilities, making him even more ideal.

                <p><em>Not from the ship</em><br>I'll call that best mush victory ever. Not only because they did it against experienced players, but because of this thread. It's mush goal to crush all hope, and make humans to cry like little girls.</p><p>If you only wanted a game with long lasting ship with full team playing together - MMM is <strong>wrong place for you</strong>. From first jump it was said - MMM for good humans vs good mushes, not for humans making 20-30 days trips to Eden with mushes killed in 2-3 days. If you buy gold only for long battle humans vs RNG events - go casting.</p><p>Not winning for mushes using easy way, when they can, is same as doing 100% PILGRED and leaving hackers kit on the bridge by humans while mushes alive. It's the greatest help for enemies you can do, playing against you own goals and really very stupid action.</p>

                <p>I wasn't on the ship either but I want to add my congrats to the mush team. It was a dream combo to have Jin Su and Raluca and they did the logical thing for mush on this setting. I can see that even if you went back on only day 2, I can see that antispore, constipaspore serum, mycoalarms and mycoscanner were finished already. Do you think mush really had another chance at victory other than what they did? If you are annoying that mush actually tried to win, then you're not getting the point of this game. It's mush vs humans.</p><p>Sadly I think that MMM are indirectly "promoting" this sort of behavior and way of thinking. Several players join MMM to get a cruise ship where they play for 20+ days and eventually get to Eden, with mush being just a little annoyance during the first couple of days. I can understand the frustration of being in a very active ship and it ending so quickly but that's exactly the role of the mush, their role is not to be caught so that humans can continue their supership peacefully.</p><p>And like someone said, there are fun ships outside of MMM, you may have some inactives, things may not be done so quickly but that's also part of the fun and to know how to deal with the cards you have on your hand.</p>

                <p>I'm (and most of the crew) agreed not to use food-proof to give mushes some time and space for actions. To give them possibility to do something really fun and clever. To NOT force them to act quick. To add some detectivity and suspense. And what i get? Yup, "we win because we can". Humans can win on active ship easily. Just every human takes the ration and pill and game is over for mushes. But we refused to win this way. Despite we can.</p>

                <p>and normally mush can't win easily on a MMM ship. So we used that opportunity... If you would have prevented a pilgred rush, which is possible (without a mush test) if you would have forseen that this could happen, we would have played sneaky longer. Maybe we would have been able to convert one person, but even that would be really really difficult with the research which was done and the smart detectives we had. and once the first mush is dead, you would have probably researched pheromodem quickly and the other mushes are found out as well.</p>

                <p>Well an easy and effective way to stop it would have been to let someone Guard the front corridor so Jin can't jump the ship to Sol (and ofc Chun has to hold the hacker kit), if the mush try the rush with a guarding person (or even 2) they will be found out after PILGRED is finished and Jin tries to go on the bridge.

                <p>Aaeni was Jin Su on my Feb MMM and we were having a whale of a time, until the lag prevented him from double checking where the ship was going (we wanted a planet, not Sol). First impression was empty "victory" but computer glitches/annoyances do happen. I couldn't have really wished for a better captain.</p><p>As for Mush victory here....well, I have not played Jin Su but have been pilot before and as mush, had run off in the Pasiphae - that feels a bit of an "empty" victory, eventually leading to the downfall of the Daedalus. Other times, I've run amok and my last ship as mush - I seriously injured the humans, and hid the mush sample (I can't remember where!), acting only after them killing my Jin Su alpha partner whose only mush activity they said was as soon as he joined the ship, he went to a dorm and slept - but the ship is still going (probably around day 8 or more now)</p><p>For Mush, Eden would be perfect, but isn't a return to sol early on just as good for them? Would you prefer they did not do anything? One ship I was on, the parting message from a mush was "I didn't have the will to kill anyone, actually, there were cameras and no one alone all over the place."</p>

                <p>Huh..so this is why someone asked to guard Front Corridor yesterday. Well, having been the victim of a berserk mush last MMM, I feel most humans' pain (Especially since I got gold mode for that ship and spent klix). But these mush do deserve a round of applause for actually trying for the mush team. My <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2514">next ship</a> turned out to be quite a pick me up and I mostly forgot all about having to wait another month for MMM. So cheer up lads, there's always good things on the horizon!</p>

                <p>Dear Humans,</p><p>What could you honestly expect from the mush crew on the ship? The way you were blowing through research left them trapped in a corner with very little maneuverability to conduct any sort of mush activity. The amount of AP it would cost for them to do anything mush related would be expensive. An active crew would quickly began asking why those players couldn't account for their missing AP and probably lead to the deaths. It wouldn't take long to determine that two players are strangely inactive or not pulling their share of their weight on a hyper active ship.</p><p>Lets be honest, on a MMM the mush really only have two or three days to operate before the noose is tightening around their necks. Mush Raluca has very interaction with the crew. Her presence anywhere outside the back end of the ship would be highly suspect and would probably result in her being revealed as a mush. Jin Su has a little more freedom to move about the ship, but being a pilot is pretty AP intensive. You can always blow off helping people once or twice, but after a third time your actions are suspect.</p><p>As someone said in an earlier post, MMM isn't PvE. If you think it is, you are sorely mistaken. The point of MMM is to get a fully active crew... yes that includes mush too.</p><p>Mush are looking for a victory too. Being on a MMM, they are assumed to be playing against a higher caliber of human players. You need to assume you are playing against higher caliber mush as well. They will adapt to their ship and do what they can to win. I can only imagine that turning someone to a beta mush on a MMM would probably be the most difficult action on a ship. With the amount of mycoalarms and cameras, it would be impossible.</p><p>I think there is a problem with expectations and reality. You may be an awesome player on random ships, but when you step up to the Major League you can expect to find yourself not as good as you once thought.</p><p>/rant</p>

                <p>Ehh, it could be that MMM ship players are still learning too. Not everyone is good at being Mush, and not everyone gets lucky too - this ship's mush team did not have a foolproof strategy and were seconds to minutes from being stopped if not outright caught as it played out (as more than one of this ships' humans have stated, Frieda 30 seconds from blocking Front corridor, Chun minutes from having caught up on reading and been able to understand what she saw on the map).</p><p>But as MMM players get better (and there appears to be a learning curve happening, as later MMM ships overall are achieving higher levels of glory and longer voyages), those playing Mush are going to get better, both at being Mush in general and at being Mush on MMM ships. Definately an arms race, and hope there's a lot of wins on both sides as time goes on!</p>

                <p>Having read this thread again, here are some thoughts.</p><p>A) Not all the humans on this ship were upset; surprised, yes, upset no. A few were upset, especially a few that invested money and were expecting more playtime/drama, but by now most of them have had some time to come to terms and are less frustrated now.</p><p>B) It was an unlikely scenario (mush Jin Su &amp; Raluca) and a bit of a risky gambit, but the RNG was on their side. (Imagine if we had a genius Raluca + Jin Su. That would have been the unstoppable combo).</p><p>C) And most importantly, they played a good game-as did the whole ship. The acted very human, and 2 days in we hadn't gotten to a place where eating was mandatory. There was also (normal) ship drama that made other people look more suspicious, etc. It's easy <em>now</em> to say that we should have blocked FC if Jin Su moved to the back of the ship, but Pilgred was at what, 26% and Jin Su seemed to be going on a mission with the rest of the assembled crew - pretty normal stuff. Jin Su and Ralcua had been saving their AP that day, but hadn't been particularly stingy the day before. Blocking FC everytime Jin Su goes to the back if he's not under suspicion is a waste of AP.</p><p>It was a good (if short) game, and I look forward to playing with everyone again.</p>

                <p>I gotta say that what hurts <em>my bottom</em> the most is that this was my second MMM ship. MMM ships don't often fall short of 10 days but my first one I was a Mush frieda and Mush Chao died on one of the first days. I waited about 3-4 days for the MMM to start which is difficult for me because I'm obsessed with this beauty of a game. I am 100% sure there is no way to beat a mush ship single handedly so - against the rules I surrendered (I was unaware of the strict rule and got my SDF point for it) and they killed me out right instead of just letting me play on Day 3.<br> <br><em>I don't blame them for that actually makes sense now.</em></p><p>Now this one I believed, I couldn't believe, that we'd be beaten by the mush and i figured purchasing Gold for the long trip would be a great decision. I never saw it coming and I took the mush for granted. The journey ended with a fizzle instead of a satisfying bang.</p><p><em>I have been on 30 ships now. 5 of those have made it past 5 days.</em></p><p>I am now on a ship where I am attempting to direct the crew and I am getting three or four players responding. Tell me you don't understand my pain now.</p>
