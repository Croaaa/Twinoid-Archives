                <p>This Ship : <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7768" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7768</a><br>Hello everyone <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>So this ship was second ship that i felt its got a chance for Eden,We find 2 starmaps we got really good projects but in end we get really less luck <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So let me start from over : I woke up as Janice and saw only Frieda awake and that she is flying out so at start i felt she may idle outside but she returned she was gold and talkactive and i was like " OK lets hope we get some better people" I moved some stuff here and there installed two cameras,Moved some stuff to important place and etc. When i got back i get happier by seeing how many active people we are getting <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"> We got an AWESOME Kuan ti,A multi Ian and Raluca,A great Hua and some others so Our Eleesha seemed active that was rare for Eleesha you know.</p><p>So only problem i had in this game was a stupid argument with Frieda <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> I mean seriously wtf was we were arguing you know,When game start i kinda wasn't sure if there is any mush hunting channel going on or not so i start pointing out everyone weired move in chat. I was carefull to not lets out any important info just small ones <img src="../../../../gfx/square/keepcool.png" alt=":K" class="tid_ico"> So that way someone may want to start a hunting with me? Yea i know it was stupid but don't we all agree that i am weired?? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So i came to game to find a private chat,There Frieda and Eleesha was talking about killing Ian someone that was silent for sometimes. At first i didn't know anything and just kept reading and wasn't sure why,I before moving to main chat asked "Did he done anything anything is a suspect or not?" And said if he done like visiting BD its ok then i moved to main chat to find yup he did and when i get back Frieda told me "Why don't you read everything before talking lout " <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> Well lets not get detailed and talk about eleesha that shout at me " Why i can't Access Neron core,Why is BIOS settings bad?" Before reading chat to know its broken <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So anyway sorry if i was a bit loud at first and active its just I am talkactive and hyperactive anyway <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>So In end we of three girl team banged Ian up and killed him,Mush. So we moved on and Paola sold last mush and we were mush free. Well other than that we found some great planets we lost Frieda in one,It was really a hard hit since we were planning for Eden and without her it would get really hard. Eleesha got inactive and that made it harder. So anyway with awesome Kuan,Caring Finola,Multi Raluca, Stephen someone that read a book without asking <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> , Savior Hua,We were able to get back to sol when we had 2 starmap and thats my dream that i lost in here again <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> Oh and Paola ,You know you was great i wanna play again with you all.</p>

                <p>Hi, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hua.png" alt=":mush_hua_50:" class="tid_ico"> here. Nice crew, we got pretty close. I missed the last couple of cycles, were we just running out of hull or something? Kuan Ti, thanks for keeping the banter lively, and the rest of the crew that stayed active was great as well. Just ran out of steam at the end there. Hope to see you folks again!</p>
