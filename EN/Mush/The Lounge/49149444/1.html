Intrigued by our surroundings, we began to explore the area, only to end up stranded on a vast open desert. The walk through the desert took a heavy toll on us and made us feel <strong>unnaturally </strong>fatigued...</p><p><strong><em>Day 14, Entry 2</em>:</strong> Oh, joy! We found a misty-covered mountain in the distance and decided to climb to the top to have a better understanding of our current location and its surroundings. Unfortunately, whilst climbing, I fell down a hole and suffered a few bruises up my bum. Oddly enough, I discovered that a wretched, nasty-looking alien lives in that hole. He called himself '<strong>Gollum</strong>'. After a few cursory introductions, I learned that the creature possesses a rather remarkable looking ring, and decided to trick him, steal the ring, and take it back to Daedalus for further analysis.</p><p><strong><em>Day 14, Entry 3</em>:</strong> Alas, the wretched alien managed to catch up with me while I was escaping with the ring. After a brief exchange of a few low blow insults with one another, he decided to snuck his hand into my pocketses (<em>*ahem*</em> my <strong>pocket</strong>) and take the ring by force. Unfortunately for him, the only thing he managed to steal out of my pocket before disappearing back into his hole is a tiny little blank piece of post-it note (Ha! the poor silly sod). That was the last I ever saw of him.</p><p><strong><em>Day 14, Entry 4</em>:</strong> After regrouping with the expedition team, we climbed down the mountain together and decided to head for greener pastures. Here, we saw a herd of gigantic but gentle looking ruminant aliens (known locally as <strong>Oliphaunts</strong>) feeding on a few nearby trees. I decided that I would approach one of the baby Oliphaunts to take a closer look and maybe even pet such wonderful and majestic creature, but just my luck, the seemingly docile creature suddenly turned around and stomped me <strong>right </strong>in the gonad. Welp, there goes my chance of passing down my top-notch immunity genes to any potential offsprings! By now, I'm starting to wonder whether my unnatural streak of misfortunes had anything to do with the ring I took from Gollum...</p><p><strong><em>Day 14, Entry 5</em>:</strong> After a few hours of me limping miserably to the next zone, Andie suddenly halts us to a stop. <em>Andie is a curious specimen to be sure; she has a slender, feminine frame and silky-smooth golden hair but also possesses one of those sharp and strong masculine stare in her eyes. Nobody can actually tell whether Andie is a guy or a girl, but everyone agrees that she is </em><strong><em>HOT</em></strong><em> as hell! Heck, I even have a </em><strong><em>poster </em></strong><em>of her right beside my bed!</em> Alarmed by her sudden warning, I went forward and asked her: "Andie! What does your androgynous eyes see?" She then points towards a small pack of vicious looking predatory aliens in the distance (known as <strong>Wargs </strong> in the local tongue) but much to our surprise, instead of running away, she decides to confront them and talk them down! <strong>Astonishingly</strong>, the wild, vicious looking canines actually seem to understand her and immediately started to oblige her every command. I mean... I've always known that Andie is eloquent with words and have served as a major diplomat before, but to be able to speak with <strong>ANIMALS </strong>too?!! Man, androgynes sure are magical creatures!</p><p><strong><em>Day 14, Entry 6</em>:</strong> We've stumbled upon another vast area of lifeless desert but unlike before, this time we're not <strong>too </strong>concerned of our fatigue. The pack of wargs Andie tamed before proved to be useful beasts of burden and we were saved from the fate of walking (or in my case, limping) through the desert. We rode through the wide desert uneventfully... except for Frieda the Grey's constant jabbering throughout the whole journey. <em>Make no mistake, Frieda the Grey is </em><strong><em>truly </em></strong><em>a wise and enigmatic being, who is said to have lived over the span of </em><strong><em>THOUSANDS </em></strong><em>of years! Some people even goes to call her the 'Grey Pilgrim' since she has seen and visited many countless worlds. Well... maybe not in person but still, she has </em><strong><em>seen </em></strong><em>a lot of different planets through the monitor of her Astro Terminal.</em> She seems to be deeply preoccupied with her train of thought and can't seem to stop blabbering about how every single thing in the cosmos is connected with one another through a magical, all-encompassing existence known universally as <strong>'Physics'</strong>. Honestly, I didn't really understand a <strong>word</strong> she was saying and just passed it all off as another one of the old coot's many 'hocus-pocus' gibberish... I'm just happy enough to still be <strong>ALIVE</strong> at this point of our expedition!</p><p><strong>*Sadly, I died before I got the chance to write this next entry but I thought I'd just finish it up anyway for the sake of closure and whatnot. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Plus, I dunno what TO DO with all this spare time now that I'm dead and not on a ship anymore!*<br></strong><br><strong><em>Day 14, Chun's Final Entry</em>:</strong> We've finally reached the end of the desert, but now we're faced with another obstacle. The road ahead is blocked on all sides except by going through a foul, putrid-smelling tunnel that reeks of death. Janice the White came forward and warned us that she senses a dangerous creature lurking in the depths of the tunnel. <em>Hmm... Janice. To shed some light on such a contradictory character such as Janice the White, one must first understand that she is a </em><strong><em>'Psychologist'</em></strong><em>. To be honest, I have no idea </em><strong><em>AT ALL</em></strong><em> regarding the definition of the word, but I'm pretty sure that means that she has the power to read other people's thoughts and bend spoons with her mind </em><strong><em>right??!?</em></strong><em> Anyway, in addition to that, one must also know that she is closely connected with the evil, malicious, omnipotent dark lord known as </em><strong><em>The Red Eye of NAURON!</em></strong><em> (I'm pretty sure that's how it's spelled) The Red Eye of NAURON is the pinnacle of evil who is hell-bent on destroying all that is good in the world and making human lives as miserable as possible and as it happens, Janice the White</em><strong><em>-through her extraordinary psychic powers-</em></strong><em>accidentally got in touch with the Dark Lord and they slowly formed a bond with one another, making them </em><strong><em>'besties'</em></strong><em>. (I've seen Janice contacting the Eye of NAURON from time to time using a mysterious black box in the Medlab and I've tried to access said black box countless of times but to no avail. I can only assume that only Janice</em><strong><em>-with her mysterious and unfathomable psychic powers-</em></strong><em>have an exclusive access to the box, so she could contact the Dark Lord directly). However, one must not confuse Janice the White as an evil character as she is </em><strong><em>indeed </em></strong><em>a sweet, friendly, nonchalant, joy-loving individual at heart, but her continued exposure to NAURON's evil mind </em><strong><em>did </em></strong><em>leave her behaving a little quirky-if not downright </em><strong><em>BIZARRE</em></strong><em>-at times. Like that time when she used a detached arm of a crewmember as a back scratcher... or that one time when she ate </em><strong><em>actual </em></strong><em>human flesh. (</em><strong><em>Holy shit, right?!</em></strong><em>)</em> In any case, the four of us decided to continue on our dangerous path ahead with extreme caution after heeding Janice the White's warning. We soon came face to face with the terror that Janice spoke of; a gigantic black arachnoid-like alien with fangs the size of our blasters and a stinger the size of our knife. Little did we know, the creature we're facing is none other than the great <strong>'Shelob'</strong> herself; a local <strong>LEGEND</strong> on this god-forsaken planet. We <strong>all </strong>fought valiantly-psychic powers or not-until the monstrous creature lay dead at our feet, and while I was just beginning to think that the worst is behind me, my infernal streak of bad luck strikes <strong>again</strong>! As I was limping around trying to regain my balance after the fight, one of Shelob's leg tripped me and I fell... gonad-first... right onto her poison-rich stinger...</p><p>So, the moral of the story is? <strong>ACCIDENTS</strong> happen! Maybe once, maybe even twice, but if you're <strong>reaally </strong>unlucky (or just happen to be carrying a cursed, evil ring with you), accidents can also happen <strong>THRICE!</strong> and by then you would probably be dead... <br><strong><br>Cheers from heaven,</strong><br><em>Zhong Chun</em></p>
