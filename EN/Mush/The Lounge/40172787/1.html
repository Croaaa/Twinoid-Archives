I was Frieda alpha mush who transferred to Hua and lived for about 10 hours after revealing myself, and died about an hour before the whole ship blew up. I am at work now, will write the AP and answer questions when I get home from work in a few hours. I absolutely <em>loved</em> this ship, I had sooooooo much fun. I hope to hear from you all in this thread soon! Oh, and it's alright with me if you guys hate me.... Won't change how much I love you all one bit.</p>

                <p>Hi Janice!</p><p>Paola got sharpshooter rifle blueprint and shooter magebook out of xyloph and you guys just left that stuff there. Sharpshooter rifle almost never misses (99% chance to hit) and being a shooter gives 2x chance to cause injuries, as well as the shooter points to deal with shooting around Ian. You had told everyone I had a blaster; this was false.... I actually don't know what Jin did with the blaster he had at one time, I guess he hid it somewhere, because he didn't drop it when he died.</p><p>But as you can see by all the injuries (2 one shot, 1 almost every other shot) that sharpshooter has a very, very high chance to cause injury. I consider it the second best weapon in the game for on-ship fighting (and vastly better than a blaster).</p><p>But I didn't want you guys to think I didn't have that blaster either.... I sure didn't want it being looked for, found, and used against me ;P</p>

Paola was so silent and helpful she was healing me and gave me blaster to kill you, but Ian ruined the plan. As for Raluca I thought it's a bit weird that I haven't seen him active, he has no Zzz status, haven't died cuz of hunger and it looked like u're the only one active mush. Why haven't u converted somebody? Once I was on a ship where we have converted everyone and only one human left. Everyone were cheating him and we had a lot of fun.</p>

                <p>Day 2 I had Hua and you spiked. Ian was active then, he wanted to do the long plan and so did I; I wanted to act totally human at first. Then (a few hours later) I realized that most of the players were not super active; I identified Andie as the most outwardly active human, and thought he was really dangerous (this was before he killed anyone, but he was nicely focused on research at first). No one had taken down alpha shower yet.</p><p>I tried to connect to Sol, then invited people to come do a research reseting group with me, only Andie answered and he only reset once, so I popped 2 spores on the way to alpha dorm, grabbed splashproof, showered on entry, took the bed I knew had to be open from the dots I counted.</p><p>When I logged in again, people were mad about Hua being in rear corridor, talking about the two new players in front corridor, Stephen's lack of skills, I knew Eleesha was brand new newbie who had never eaten, and Terrence completed tutorial but stayed on bridge.... You logged in and went for the front of the ship, but you were asking about a reset in Nexus, so I spiked Hua and trapped Nexus for you, then went back to bed. You grabbed your spore right away <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Then I waited and acted totally human; you guys rushed gas and alarms, and I saw the alarm be dropped in nexus (not hidden), I was sure that rear corridor with Hua had a hidden alarm, I knew that one alarm stayed in the lab and 3 were taken by Andie, one by Jin.... but not sure where they all were put. I spored once again a couple days later while collecting scraps, eating to cover the dirtyness as by now alpha shower was down.</p><br><p>Ian believed Pilots were the ship's greatest weakness, and I came to believe him, thus Jin had to die (I'd decided he was the smartest and most dangerous of the humans aboard.... Andie was just.... too high strung. Killing the two inactives in FC wasn't stupid (though a mycoalarm to watch them would have cost less AP and allowed them to come back to the ship and be helpful), but killing Stephen and Terrence was really kind to the mush, because those two players had been on camera from before mush selection - they could not have been secretly converted, ever, unless they came back to play and moved. But he threw all that AP into killing them, hurt morale further.... and didn't progress research or piloting and allowed the hull to drop lower and me to 'act human' by killing a few hunters and collecting some scrap, and not really helping progress stuff I didn't want done either.</p><br><p>Ian is always a high cost to fight around; I very purposefully went to him when I was exposed as mush. He was mush too; but he had last logged in over a day before and didn't really participate in the end. Except passively; idle Ians are great protection too.</p>
