The ship : <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8429" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8429</a></p><p>A really great ship from the beginning to the end despite <span class="tid_strike">the chef constantly grumbling</span> the evil Kangaroo's plots against us and the RNG hating us.</p><br><p><img src="http://mush.vg/img/icons/ui/neron_fluw.png" alt=":mush_neron_flu_1:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>The mush hunt</strong></p><p>It started quite slow, with nothing remarkable to notice, if I remember correctly. Chun, Janice, Andie, Jin Su and I starting sharing suspicions early while watching each other out of the corner of our eyes.</p><p>On D4, Gioele, who had been inactive during the weekend, woke up and apparently had a hearty breakfast composed of a coffee and ration. Then he went up to the bridge, and... didn't manage to finish his planet analyses. It seemed obvious that even the caffeine hadn't helped him. A few shots and punches later, we had our first dead mush.</p><p>Then the hunt stalled. Unsurprisingly, when we finished Pheromodem, the Mush channel was completely empty. That was to be expected, since <strong>of course</strong> people had announced its progress in public. Mycoscan also revealed nothing. I was the only one who found a spore, which was probably a starting spore.</p><p>We didn't have any convincing suspects, and not a single confirmed human for a long time. Hua and I had been cleared as alpha mush by the Xyloph list, but there was no certainty about possible betas. It took two more days, and Eleesha's death in a dorm, to finally confirm Andie and Roland, who caught illnesses. Then we managed to confirm Raluca because she was starving. Janice and Jin Su proved fun to confirm, because neither of them ever double-ate in public or in front of cameras. Janice made a point of taking bananas and the apron to FC, to eat in private. There was a hilarious moment when she picked up three bananas in the lab, and Jin Su searched FC to confirm that she hadn't hidden them. Then I searched the corridor in case Jin was lying... and later learned that Andie had searched the corridor too in case <strong>I</strong> was lying. Jin Su was confirmed the same way, by searching the garden.</p><p>Eventually, we ended up with four suspects : Kuan Ti, Derek, Terrence, and Paola. Kuan Ti was our main suspects, because he started starving at the wrong time, or so it seemed, based on what he told us. We were also starting to frown at his lack of luck with planets, as every single one of them had mankarogs, seismic activity or volcanoes.</p><p>That's when we decided to resort to Operation Kangaroo and Operation Steaks. The first one started by Andie claiming to be a kangaroo in the mush channel, and then numerous allusions to kangaroos in the main channel. We were hoping that the mush would betray themselves by saying that Andie had started it. A bit far-fetched, and disappointingly, it didn't work. But it did lead to a crazy kangaroo-based RP that lasted until the last days.</p><p>Operation Steaks had a few hiccups, but was a complete success. We had had two steaks in Icarus Bay for days, so I finally froze them, brought them to the refectory, and Chun took them to the bridge. Our plan was to ask Paola and Kuan Ti to scan and get one (or both) of them to eat those very rotten rations, and either prove themselves human or mush. A little cheap, I know, but we wanted proof before curing (or killing) anyone.</p><p>However, it turned out that Kuan Ti got sick during an expo. So... Terrence, Derek, or Paola ? Miss Rinaldo had been quiet but remarkably efficient so far, finishing Xyloph, getting four rebel bases, and upgrading Neron to v.7. We knew that she should be starving soon and, ruthlessly, we made sure to eat <strong>all</strong> the bananas (we had 8 plants and Heat lamps, so that was a <strong>lot</strong> of bananas) so that those disgusting rations were the only food left in the entire ship. When she woke up, Paola slipped out of the bridge to see if there were bananas in the garden, and had no choice but to eat one of the rations. Which... did <strong>not</strong> make her sick.</p><p>Our friend the RNG chose that moment to send us merchants offering Pilgred against a crew member. Jin Su fled the bridge, while we frantically checked the map to see if no one was idling in a storage. And then Chun woke up and <strong><em>finally</em></strong> cured our second and last mush.</p><p>I already said that on the ship, and I was not the only one, but I would like to thank the crew again for that mush hunt. First of all, kudos to Paola, who did a splendid job as comms officer and managed to stay under the radar for so long. She did nothing mushy, but it was her best option, because rampaging wouldn't have been as efficient as the bloodbath the ship could have become if humans had started killing suspects. And we all know how hard it is to stay hidden as solo mush Paola. She had nerves, and never panicked, not even when she was pretty much cornered.</p><p>That was the second great thing about that mush hunting phase. It took ten long days before we finally managed to cure Paola. And yet nobody ever lost patience. Terrence and Derek knew nothing about who was confirmed or not, and indeed Terrence worried that we might have beta mush by now. We tried to keep him under control, and it was really remarkable to cure the right person without anyone getting killed or cured by mistake.</p><p>Finally, a huge <strong><em>thank you</em></strong> to the entire human crew for not doing any mush tests. It may have made the hunt longer, but it made it so much more interesting. It kept some of the paranoia alive, and forced us to think, to plot, to actually investigate. I hadn't had so much fun mush hunting in a very long time.</p><br><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Wow, what a wall of text, and I haven't even got to the second part, about the struggle against the RNG. I need to sleep now, so if anyone wants to continue the story, feel free to do so. I will also add a few screenshots in the morning.</span></p>

Not a single person mush tested. Up until ~D8, every single person on the crew except Chun was still a suspect. So while we had an active and cooperative mush hunting team, we were also all suspicious of each other. The paranoia was <em>glorious</em>. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Because Paola did such an amazing job at staying hidden for so long, the mush hunt team had to get <em>"creative"</em> in our cat and mouse game. I mean, we actually finished the <em>Retro-Fungal Serum</em> but we didn't have a clue on who to use it on! So, I hid the RFS in the Central Corridor and I whispered it into the ears of the people I trusted in case the mush rampaged and we needed fast access.</p><p>Only the mush didn't rampage. Days went by. People were getting impatient. As a result, <strong>Operation Kangaroo</strong> and <strong>Operation Steak</strong> were conjured to flush out the mush.</p><p><em><strong>OPERATION STEAK</strong></em></p><p>This one was simple: we froze some secretly spoiled steaks and dropped them off in the Refectory. The plan was to get Chun to drop the rations in places where our suspects might need to eat, like the Nexus (for Plasma Shields) or the Bridge (for Planet Scanning or Comms).</p><p>We hoped that people would start throwing up and we'll be able to cross some names in our very large suspect list at that time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We hit a few snags with this plan: we have too many bananas, many suspects recently already ate, Plasma Shields was finished before we could drop a ration in the Nexus, etc. <strong>Operation Steak</strong> dragged on for a long time, and we were losing hope of its success...</p><br><p><em><strong>OPERATION KANGAROO</strong></em></p><p>Fortunately, while waiting for <strong>Operation Steak</strong>, we had a much more fun operation in play that's based 100% on social engineering. The idea behind this operation was simple: get the mush to slip up on information that only mush could know... for example, <em>being able to see the names in Mush Channel when Pheromodem research is completed</em>.</p><p>Now, anyone who knows me know that I absolutely love social engineering... even if it's likely to fail. It's just as much about the journey as it is the destination! So, I typed this in Mush Channel:</p><p><em>I AM A BIG, BAD KANGAROO WHO LIKES PIZZAS AND BEER.</em></p><p>I figured that's memorable enough for the Mush to know who said it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> But we didn't want to ask too soon since mush will probably remember where they saw it from if we asked right away. So we waited. Very patiently. And plotted.</p><p>Over the next 8 cycles, the mush hunt team kept finding ways to mention <strong>kangaroos</strong> in general chat just so that people have it fresh in their minds. Nonsensical things like: "<em>animals like rats and kangaroos are not SDF-approved</em>". Then it just got crazier, and crazier... (I admit I may have played a part in it). Some of the later kangaroo-related RPs: "<em>you should be happy that SDF took care of the universe-endangering kangaroos</em>". In our final days we were even stalked by a rogue kangaroo while we were looking for starmap pieces. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>After we waited long enough we opened PMs with our remaining suspects and tried to "naturally" steer the conversation towards kangaroos, hoping we can eventually ask them "who said they were a kangaroo?", hoping someone would slip up and say "Andie". <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Unfortunately, no one slipped up, mostly because our remaining suspects weren't very talkative at all! And yet, I'm so glad we did it, because <strong>Operation Kangaroo</strong> had led to some very amusing RPs about "evil kangaroo collaborators". <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><em><strong>OPERATION STEAK PART 2</strong></em></p><p>Suddenly, a miracle happened. One of our operations succeeded! Our then top suspect, Paola, had to eat because she was supposed to be starving, but we deprived the entire ship of all food... except for <strong>Operation Steak</strong>'s rotten rations.</p><p>We knew it had 90% chance of food poisoning and she ate it without falling sick. Combined with the fact she was our top suspect at that time, it was enough for us. So we stabbed her with the RFS... and she was human! Hurrah! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>After that, we patted ourselves in the back a lot, since we managed to cure a well-hidden and composed mush without a single human-on-human casualty! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hi there, boss. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So, I finally have time to finish the story, and add a few pictures.</p><p>As Andie said, Operation Kangaroo started with an anonymous <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/4/5/a6c23bcd_516.jpg">message</a> in the mush channel, which, although it didn't trick our sneaky little Paola, prompted Neron to send daily <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/a/f/16ec3cc5_516.jpg">warnings</a>. The Kangaroo Threat soon became a regular topic of <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/e/0/d9f5674f_516.jpg">discussion</a>, as we wondered if it was the cause of all our bad luck.</p><p>See for yourselves : from the very first day, our <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/5/9/ac32c3fa_516.jpg">planet thread</a> was invaded by <span class="tid_strike">kangaroos</span> mankarogs, volcanoes and seismic zones. Kuan Ti must have found <strong>one</strong> good planet in the first week, unfortunately it didn't have oxygen, and that was when we were desperately looking for oxygen planets. The various scanners had the same bad luck, except for mushy Paola, who found a nice little planet and added a <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/3/9/c3d402f7_516.jpg">private joke</a> in the planet name. Ironically, that was the planet where Kuan Ti got ill, which allowed us to decide to cure Paola instead.</p><p>After curing her, the bad luck continued. Volcanoes, mankarogs, double volcanoes, earthquakes and volcanoes... We were clearly in a dangerous corner of the galaxy. We still managed to do a few expeditions, during which <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/1/f/c9a20238_516.jpg">strange things</a> happened, but we were giving up hopes of getting to Eden.</p><p>Until finally, that miraculous triple exploration on a beautiful planet, around D13. An expedition during which, of course, we were surrounded by kangaroos :<br><a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/e/1/e6b5bbec_516.jpg">Expo 1</a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/e/d/f0fbf5f9_516.jpg">Expo 2</a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/c/7/c3698e40_516.jpg">Expo 3</a></p><p>Despite the evil beasts constant attempts at sabotaging us, we found not one but two starmap fragments on the planet. A few days later, we found the final starmap.</p><p>Of course, the RNG and the Kangaroos tried to foil us one last <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/3/2/8a414312_516.jpg">time</a> while we were trying to rush some research, but eventually, the commander made his final <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/a/a/ea411bf6_516.jpg">speech</a> and took us to the mythic Eden.</p><p>Remember, everyone : <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/c/1/013f14d6_516.jpg">beware the Kangaroos</a>, they're everywhere. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/chart.png" alt=":chart:" class="tid_ico"></p>
