                <p>Your "MVP", Hua here! (I'm not conceited, that's just how confident my character's personality was, honest)</p><p>Well, I guess I'll start from the beginning... TE was having an open jump because Aaeni wanted to have one. Kobb and Peanutz ended up having ships aligned with mine but I was a bit reluctant to jump with them because Aaeni really wanted me. But I adore both of them and the temptation was too much. We were the last three awake on the ship (Primesauce had quietly joined with us).</p><p>There wasn't too much conversation on the ship when we spawned. A few important threads still needed to be created and there was little to no inventory done. It's been a long time since I've done a public ship and I've heard stories of the inactivity so I let out a sigh and decided that if this is one of those ships then I'd just have to be extra fun for everyone left over. We had about 4 injuries, 3 broken fingers (one of which included myself) and 1 broken foot. About 6 people were huddled in medlab awkwardly, Stephen had been laying in the bed (apparently disconnecting in the process of fixing himself). I whined relentlessly about my post-cryo tumble that snapped my poor sausage of a finger. Eventually Finola came to help everyone... TWO people got sepsis right off the bat (Chao and Stephen) this was post selection.</p><p>I move my way to the dorms and wasn't able to get a bed for the time being. Janice and Eleesha were laying in beds in the room. I decided I would sit and wait patiently for a while. A few cycles later and I saw Janice attempting to fix Eleesha's Chronic Vertigo when a peculiar message popped up. I shrugged and giggled about them having flavor text in it now (I have no idea what changes were made in the new season). I posted something in the public chat and this made Eleesha panic. Knowing who I was and overestimating my expertise, she did a flying leap from her bed and began beating on frail Kuan Ti. I did a double take at what I was witnessing and watch Eleesha leave the dorm. Kuan Ti had survived the assault. I saw her heading up to the lab where Ian was. I made the crew aware of the situation, Eleesha tried to pass it off as Kuan Ti having transferred into her. Yeah, okay. <em>Rolls eyes.</em></p><p>Only myself and Chun were online at the time. She seemed to trust me enough to hand me the knife. I hadn't had a bed yet but I hadn't done anything with my AP, either. I had a good 8-10 AP. Nobody else was on and she was hiding with Ian. The only person who can possibly move him was our inactive Gioele. I had no idea how reliable the rest of the crew was so I felt an obligation to TRY to kill her, or at least do some massive damage so that someone else may come on to finish the job. I went and... slit her throat immediately... RIP Mush Eleesha. Peanutz, who was Eleesha, had made me aware of why she did what she did. Apparently she figured I had to have known about the shrink's message outing the mush and decided she'd strike before I could. <strong>I would never have figured it out.</strong></p><p>(cont...)</p>

                <p>The ship began to show itself to me. Jin Su went inactive, Paola went inactive, Ian went inactive, Gioele went inactive, and Raluca was insane. The rest of the crew were still difficult to figure. Terrence had already gotten dirty which had me looking his way. I had made a joke in the background regarding Stephen as he had smelled suspiciously like candy. Hua figured he was a pinata in disguise! <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/odK2qqV.png?1">This</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/bBkC4ux.png?1">this</a> happened.</p><p>I began deliberating on who our next mush was. Terrence was certainly the largest suspect as he moved often and got dirty often. But... It didn't feel right to me. He was just doing entirely too much for me to suspect any foul play inbetween. I had spoken to Peanutz in the background and joked about it being Janice who had revealed her. No strong evidence yet, however...</p><p>Roland went inactive... great... two pilots and the only other one was Frieda. No problem, I'll just have to work really hard! Raluca continued to be erratic and was dirty and moving between dorms. I suggested to Chun and Janice that they not comfort her, they agreed... She eventually died of depression. We tried to reach out to her multiple times but she refused all hails. No loss.</p><p>A day went by bam! Jin Su became active, apologizing thoroughly. I had a good feeling about him and something made me like him. It's a shame that he'd eventually go inactive again and starve... Roland also became active, apologizing, assuring us that he'd most certainly be more active (he was right). Then... Paola became... "active..." In that, she woke up, grabbed the comms title back and continued not to do anything. We had no choice but to kill her despite her being a good logistics AP farm... Not before Stephen intelligently grabbed logistics and took her job completely.</p><p>Fires destroyed two pots... including my precious butt alien (I was going to eat that butt...). I really wanted to find this last mush now. We managed to confirm Roland human when he stopped off in the refectory and grabbed a coffee then proceeded to fly out three times and kill a ton of hunters, we counted his AP to be sure and came to the conclusion that he had to have eaten a ration and drank a coffee.</p><p>My eyes were set on Janice... I had begun to wonder before when I broadly mentioned "Eleesha outed herself"... Janice had come in and mentioned the shrink message. Peculiar... She was always in the best position to do research but she focused on pushing projects ONCE and hugged people who didn't require morale. That wasn't experienced player behavior so how did she know about that shrink message that not even <strong>I</strong> knew about? I began to suspect that she had been briefed by Eleesha prior to her death. That wasn't nearly enough evidence but I kept it in my mind.</p><p>(cont...)</p>

                <p>I had had some fun little rp with <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/WY3uFNh.png?1">Frieda </a>as I crushed over the <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/Ve8zXgx.png?1">master chef </a> (This conversation is important). Projects had been moving quite swimmingly when Frieda took time out of her schedule to help along with Chun. We got the mycoscan done and encouraged everyone to go test themselves. The only one with a spore was Chao who had received it during a failed transfer attempt by Eleesha. Janice had eventually responded to it saying that she had a spore count over 999 and is so cute that she must not be human! Ahahaha! A funny joke... I've taunted as a mush before in such a way...</p><p>It was Day 5 Cycle 8 now. Jin Su had mentioned starving (this was before he went inactive for the second time) a day earlier (his message said "1d ago"<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">. I asked if she had eaten, nobody could say that they had seen her having eaten... Except Finola. She mentioned seeing her eat on Day 5 Cycle 2. Good good... Now step 2, find out who was awake when and when the ship started. I asked Stephen who told me what he knew in the mentioned screenshot. Ok, and then I checked the records of who woke up when... Janice had been awake before Jin Su... Peculiar. This meant that she had to have been starving at the same cycle or before he did. This also meant she had to have taken at LEAST 2 points of health damage (1 healed from day change would still make her 1 hp short). It now 30 minutes from Day 6, Chun and Finola had been working on RFS in secret after we had mulled over the information presented. They were going to stick Janice as they agreed with the information considering her lack of helpful actions, her free access to both dorms, and her lack of eating habits. I just needed to nail the coffin now. There was hard evidence on her and I needed to get it before day changed healed her to full and wiped it away. I rushed for the medikit and checked her... <strong>She wasn't hurt</strong>. You could say she self healed but for 1 or 2 points of damage? Nah.</p><p>I went to bed and woke up with a mush free ship. Janice had told us that she actually had eaten much earlier, for what purpose, we haven't the foggiest. She didn't need the AP and she followed suit when people started claiming starvation like any mush who didn't know their body's timer would. Either way, we had done it. That was it for the mush hunt.</p><p>We had a lot of fun as I kept pushing to keep people interested in the ship up until they were keeping ME interested in it. XD I also managed to win over Stephen! (<a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/qJym9GF.png?1">This</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/g6YZACV.png?1">this</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/gDSrWT6.png?1">this</a>). Then Hua finally <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/wsjLszJ.png?1">got some</a>... <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/h2nyW8V.png?1">twice.</a> The ship was so much fun. Terrence and Finola had hilarious arguments with each other. Chao was absolutely adorable and I had Frieda be one of Hua's go-to people for problems. Hua also tried to give Chun a Wang... But then Frieda stole Chun's Wang! Yet Chun was a good sport and still faithfully fixed her Wang whenever it broke. Kuan Ti would later scoop Chun up with some dapper comments anyways... When he wasn't drunk and leaving lit cigars in turret rooms which would later explode.</p><p>Roland wasn't too active on the chat but he was helpful. Janice spoke rarely as well but when she did there were some fun little comments. I would narrate a good chunk of expos like <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/NmUJ3Te.png?1">this</a> one. I also caught an alien mantis, thinking he was a cricket. I named him Don Peanutz Alexander Wigglebottom! After our ill-fated mush. He also turned out to be a crude 1950's gangster mantis who broke Terrence's legs (again) and caused ship problems! I would say more as this ship was rich with events from beginning to end but I think I'll leave some filling in for the rest of the crew! Also, we had so many broken things at the end of the ship (27) that even our shrink <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/iwKaDnX.png?1">broke!</a></p>

That's what people usually do when they see that message crop up (I knew about it because I've seen the question several times in the forums).</p><p>And anyway, as you said, I panicked, especially as I had about 10 minutes before I left and I was already running late.</p><p>At least I must have entertained Janice when she woke up and read our private channel.</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">AAARGH, Janice, look at the logs, I've outed myself ! And Kuan Ti and Hua are in the dorm, they're going to notice ! Should I deface the logs ?... No, Hua is active and she's going to react. And both of us are in the dorm, that would put us both in a very short list of suspects. ... Right, I'm going to try to do some damage before I get killed. I'll try to kill Kuan Ti... wait, maybe Hua would have been a better target. Well, never mind, I've already starting punching Kuan Ti... damn, he's not dead. Ok, gonna transfer to Chao and try to kill a few people. ... Alright, I've spiked him, and... AAAARGH, I forgot to pick Transfer. And now that I think of it, I think he's injured, he might not have been the best transfer target... Oh well, I have no spore now, and no AP to extract. Okay, I'm screwed. I'm so sorry, good luck for the rest of the ship. At least I'm hiding with Ian, it's going to take them some time to kill m... </span></span> She must have laughed a lot when she read that. Or facepalmed. I did both, but I really felt sorry for letting her down. It wasn't my fault, but I could at least have done some damage, and I failed spectacularly. Thanks for not doing pheromodem, by the way. I felt guilty about enabling you to unlock more research, especially pheromodem.</p><p>Anyway... <em>grumbles again</em> I suppose I should congratulate you on getting to Eden. But I won't. <em>Grmpf.</em> I'm sure I would have converted the whole lot of you if it hadn't been for that shrink session.</p><p>...

We did it, friends! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This was a pretty great ship overall, very smooth on the mush-hunting end (sorry Peanutz, I'm sure you'd have given us a heck of a time if the RNG hadn't betrayed you) and more importantly, nicely active in the RP department! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Long ships can be a slog if the players don't keep things interesting - I've been on ships that were only hanging on for D10 casting tickets and dragged horribly when everyone stopped talking. But this one I enjoyed the whole way through, thanks in part to Hua and all her crazy exploits. It was just a great environment for messing around in-character while going about the business of finding Eden and keeping the ship alive.</p><p>BadBlanket did a pretty good job detailing the mush hunt, and I don't really have much to add. I took a gamble trusting him with Eleesha's assassination early on, but I kept an eye on him for some time after because I do know that he loves playing (and is good at) the manipulation game. In the end, we had better suspects and Occam's razor led me to finally trust him for real instead of hanging onto the slight possibility that he was being an evil mastermind. Cured our mush Janice, and calculated Eden by... gosh, D15 or so. It seemed too early to be over already, and the crew was willing to push for D20, which I'd been close to achieving a couple times but had just missed.</p><p>We were very adamant that we wouldn't take stupid risks, especially not ones that would deny any players their first Eden just because they'd failed the survival run. And so the most active players watched that ship like hawks, going out of our way to make sure everyone was in safe health ranges. (We went through <em>5 Health/Morale threads</em> at a good <em>150+ posts each</em> while we did this!) Having a very active, mission-fed Finola and myself with 5AP a cycle (Refectory bed with Logistics Expert Stephen watching over me once we had our starmaps) were amazing for that.</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/arrow.png" alt=":arrow:" class="tid_ico"> And now for some screenshots I saved, for those both on and off-ship! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>HUA/STEPHEN:</strong><br><a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/mWR1zrp.png">Hua comes to Chun seeking relationship advice</a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/kVX4iBD.png">The <strong>full</strong> aftermath of their first... refectory party</a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/XSxBdgW.png">RIP Precati </a>(Hua planted one of those foul things right before we set off for Eden, though <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Sadly, I missed screencapping Hua's peanut butter craving posts after she got pregnant - something that she never announced outright in chat because Hua herself hadn't figured it out.

                <p>Howdy! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/finola.png" alt=":mush_finola_50:" class="tid_ico"> Finola here.</p><br><p>Yeah, I know it’s been 3 weeks.. but.. Well, apparently, those anabolics work waaaaaaay too differently than I expected.. Used that last dose to make it to Roland’s dorm for the last getting-pregnant-attempt aaaaand.. can’t remember a thing after. Should add the 3 weeks blackout to the side effects section, apparently. (Btw it’s was my first ship where they <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/9XLhbxx.jpg?1">haven’t been swallowed</a> the same day they were made.)</p><p>So. First thing to mention about this voyage: I was aware 4 TE members were on board, but I knew nothing about them. Well, except Peanutz, who's kinda famous for her ultimate knowledge and whom I've shipped with once before. So circumstances, surrounding her sudden death, surprised me a lot, and I couldn't understand the whole thing until she’s explained all in a Fail Thread (so yep, I would have never figured out a damn thing either, thinking that was just a funny msg). That mess even made me think it was a part of some tricky plan (rather weird, but whatever), helping to gain some trust to Hua or Kuan for quite a while and keep an eye on them. Hehe.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/TS8tU4K.jpg">Insane Raluca</a> and Paola <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/uzQXF4T.jpg">passed away</a> on the very first days, which helped to reduce the suspects list a bit.</p><p>Among the rest Terrence was the most mushy acting, so he commanded nearly all my attention. Until Janice went into running-around-and-hugging-random-people thing (she also didn't help a bit with projects, as was mentioned, neither she did much towards pushing research). And Terrence at least helped with useful stuff. So Janice kinda won that battle from my point of view (-: So, we all separately came to one main suspect. And finally were drawn together <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/GRgx3e0.jpg">in one PM</a>, yep.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/LjEKqaL.jpg">Research</a> was going pretty fast when Chun and Frieda had ap to assist, though in the beginning Chao (how ironically) was mostly <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/yvFvFSe.jpg">my only research buddy</a>. So we didn’t have any problems with finishing RFS before Janice even had a chance to suspect anything (also, here’s the <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/ac7ATVw.jpg">mycoscan joke</a>, which triggered alarm not only in Hua’s mind).</p><p>Btw <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/xj8xSD9.jpg">projects</a> also weren’t far behind, I must admit.</p><p>After curing Janice, we were lucky to get Pilgred in list of trader’s offerings, so <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/3jkPz2k.jpg">we’ve sold our drooling hairy hippie</a> to aliens without much regret and didn’t have to move a single finger to fix the Reactor.</p><p>And we lived happily ever after, doing things, fixing stuff, making <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/VtvI608.jpg">expos</a>. Once we’ve even <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/yTcJwCZ.jpg">lost Frieda’s Wang</a>, but found him eventually on our way back to Icarus. When the last starmap was finally found, Kuan Ti calculated the route to Eden, using <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/sfN5PJM.jpg">Frieda’s theory</a>, and we were free to settle down at last. But decided to make the adventures last a bit more all together^.</p><p>...Until the Last Apron Battle :V</p><p>^(Though GPU cycles made our life become a <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/fzROLXM.jpg">constant stress</a> and we once even nearly lost Frieda (who got 14 damage per cycle) <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/A906xWY.jpg">and Hua</a>).</p><p>=========</p><p><strong>Some stuff from behind the scenes:</strong></p><p>- Didn’t get a chance to settle down my love life properly on this voyage: tried to <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/K69JTCj.jpg">drop KT a hint</a>, but it didn’t get any further, Stephen and Chao were taken (and the last one - even kinda double-taken against all odds), Terrence was my evil twin, - so I ended up with Roland being my breeding partner. Though Rolo was quite a fidget and Janice has stolen him once just in front of my nose <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":sq_bad:" class="tid_ico"> Sad I don’t have a screenshot of our little cat-fight, but.. well, it wasn’t such a big deal after all, since Rol appeared to be an expert of safe DTD <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Yes, he cheated on me, but he did it.. with a spacesuit on! (Seriously. He flirted with Janice, went to IB to pick a spacesuit and dropped it right after.)<br>- But I still had one good safety valve: <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/c1x02nB.jpg">mocking Terrence was fun aaaaaall the way</a>.<br>- <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/wgm02F2.jpg">Don goes hulk</a>.<br>- 1) <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/NxhtWSk.jpg">Hua suspects smth (PM)</a> and 2) <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/o3VUUQz.jpg">Hua gets pregnant</a>, the peanut butter edition.<br>- <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/iNjXXSp.jpg">Goodbye you 2, Terry</a> (sad that I didn’t catch the part where his inner freud wakes up for the last time)</p>
