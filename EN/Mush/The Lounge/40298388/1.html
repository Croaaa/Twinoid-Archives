                <p>Hi guys, Ian here from our long voyage! It was 18 days, 7 cycles I believe!</p><p>We started out the ship half a day or one day after MMM, and I am glad to say this ship has been full so many active players and Gold players! I really enjoyed myself!</p><p>Here is a brief summary of events:</p><p>After we all got out of Cryo and Mush were selected, our great Chun organised a quick Mush hunting team to delete our first Mush, Jin Su (It's always the commander!) We found him out when the Mush Sample was missing for nearly 3 days, and when Chun found it searching randomly, the only people who could have been near it were Jin Su and a few others, including me. Before Jin Su got assassinated though, we had a Griefer Derek, who killed out Stephen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> When I saw that, I rushed to the medlab immediately to protect our dear Chun who was together with Mush Jin Su. Glad to say that got me some brownie points (And a little 'reward' after, heh <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>Soon after, me and Andie headed the research and we did it really quickly, churning out Antispore Gas and Constipation Serum, among a whole lot of other Researches quickly by alternating bumps with each other. We were on our mission to eliminate or find the last Mush, and we had pinpointed Eleesha, who was behaving so mushily.. having some morality in me, I decided to tell Chun of my intent to rush THE CURE and I got Andie to do it with me within one cycle with his stocked up missions and me drinking coffee from a Thermos. Chun sticked Eleesha with it and.. lo and behold! She was human! (At least we saved one human soul <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> )</p><p>We quickly deduced that the last Mush had given up when his partner died so fast, and that it was either our dormant Kuan Ti, or our Giole whom kept hovering between inactivity and jeopardising our ship with taking commander title and not doing anything. We decided to kill Kuan, who was the Mush, and later Giole so that we could give our Frieda commander. She pretty much held it for the rest of the game.</p><p>With some great projects from Paola, help from everyone, and me and Andie churning out the research, we got everything maxed out by day 12. While it now seemed more like a full co-op game now with everyone being human, we now faced a greater enemy: The dreaded RNG. We couldn't get GPU due to taking plasma shields over it and the ship pretty much destroyed much of our will and resolve, and consumed lots of our AP too. The fires ravaged my plants and my 8 pots slowly diminished to 3. My bad luck with Jumpkins always got the pots destroyed everytime I planted one <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now, our crew was facing our final enemy: Inactivity. With real life taking its toll on us, most of us became inactive and got hit by fires, metal sheets, and bouts of depression. This killed off our Raluca, who decided sleeping in the dorms for a long while without reporting morale/health was a great idea, and Eleesha, who drifted in and out of inactivity. Our last casualty was Paola, who suddenly became inactive and at 2 health, tried to get to the medkit but just one step before taking it up, hurt herself and managed to put the 'fun' in her funeral. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>At day 15, we decided that maybe we were taking too many casualties and should head back to SOL for an easy victory. However, many of us, back from Real Life, persisted, and decided to clamber ahead. Ahead, into the dark, dense space filled with aliens, hunters, random wildfires, and room collapses..</p><p>At day 18, we finally had a last stand. Most of us were heavily damaged, and Frieda just found a planet with the last Cristalite zone that we needed for the starmap fragment - but it was laden with crazy health depleting zones too. Our heroic entourage of Janice, Andie, Frieda and of course myself went into the planet and walked for what it seemed like forever, until we found.. THE LAST STARMAP FRAGMENT! When we got back, all the gears turned into motion. Chun, our great leader, whom was running around the past two weeks dilligently healing everyone, commanded all of us to put the starmaps into the nexus, and finish any research that may be needed to be done. I was honoured to be able to be the one to decode the fragments for Eden!</p><p>So in closing, it was a great ship. I enjoyed every second of it, through the good and the bad. I do hope each and every one of us do play again with each other, it is a great crew!</p>

That was a great ship and such an exciting ending.</p><p>Really I can't say enough how great our Chun was this ship. Right from the beginning she was on the ball with the Mush Hunt and all the way to the end she was organizing Health/Morale threads, taking care of coffee, and just keeping the ship alive. This never would have happened without her.</p><p>Of course our pilots were great too. Hua, Roland, and Terrance all did a fantastic job clearing every hunter wave and getting the scrap too. I think this is by far the most drone upgrades I've ever witnessed (which is why Terrance is at the top of our glory list, first time I've seen that).</p><p>Last but not least, our Diplomats/Morale officers Janice and Andie were key to survival and at least one managed to make it to every expo. And of course, Ian, Paola, and Raluca get a big thank you for doing their roles so well. I'm sorry that two of you didn't make it to the end with us.</p><p>I'll probably have more to say at some point but I wanted to get the report on here.</p>

                <p>Chun here!</p><p>I can't say it enough how proud of all of you I am. At around Day 15 I was the main one saying "We're taking too much damage to keep up with, we should probably head to Sol before we start losing people". They wanted to continue and I understood and didn't argue with them. Even though I had a different opinion, they were all dedicated and I would give them the same dedication, they deserved that much. I'd still stand by going to Sol with everyone than going to Eden with some (though most everyone made it so great work!). The crew is important to me, more so than Eden.</p><p>As for Derek, I was so pissed because I knew it was going to happen. He snatched my armor and the knife before Mush selection and I knew. I told everyone that he was going to kill someone human or not. Somehow, that managed to get him to drop the knife but it didn't stop him from grabbing two blasters and taking out our high level Stephen (RIP). Hopefully he gets what coming to him.</p><p>Paola died the cycle before we did the last expo which ended up being our victory. I'm so sorry that happened to you, Paola, you should never do anything when you're at around 4 health, we'd have taken care of you.</p><p>Also to Jin Su... I felt pretty bad about having to kill you. You tried your best and your "partner" left you to fend for yourself. A high level Kuan Ti who was active up until Mush selection. You deserved better and I wish it could've been you we hit with the serum.</p><p><strong>Ian</strong>: Fantastic with the plants and excellent in bed <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">. I'd have trusted you quicker with the mush hunt if Ian wasn't one of the more difficult characters to read.<br><strong>Frieda</strong>: You deserved that commander title. Despite life getting in the way you were dependable and courageous!<br><strong>Terrence</strong>: Definitely a seasoned player, as well. You did magic with those drones and managed to be successful with them where I've always seen failure.<br><strong>Hua</strong>: My homicidal teddy bear. I trusted you early, the vibes I got from you made you easy to trust, especially your reluctance to carry things that Mush would relish the opportunity to. Also loved how you took my side on the kube when it was you who did it. XP<br><strong>Janice</strong>: You were fantastic and I loved a lot of the one-liners you put up! A shame it was difficult to get you a bed. Also sorry about breaking your nose... I don't know my own strength.<br><strong>Andie</strong>: One of the first people I trust. If the commander is a top mush suspect and he asks who wants a mission, you can probably suspect that a Devo Andie isn't his partner. Great with the research and extremely helpful with the fires and healing, it was a pleasure!<br><strong>Roland</strong>: Nobody would've expected you were a bronze because you did your job so well! You were honest when you went inactive and faithfully returned to us like you promised! You helped out a ton, even when the hunters were dead you were putting out fires and healing people left and right!</p><p>To our tragic few: Paola, Raluca, and Eleesha. Sadly less activity harmed you but don't go thinking it's your fault. Life is more important than a video game to be sure. You all played a powerful role to get us where we got (especially Paola with her updates and Raluca with Pilgred). We tried to keep you going but it's so hard to keep up with people's health when they're alone. We wish you could've joined us.</p><p>Thank you again, everyone, for your hard work and perseverance! Remember: nothing is more important than each other. Hope to have the privilege to play with you all again!</p>

                <p>Hello, I was Janice. I don't know if I have too much to add here; Chun and Ian pretty much covered all the important details. I didn't want to read this thread without at least a "hello" though. I'm glad when I'm able to make a few people smile in real life while also providing virtual comfort to their characters.</p><p>I've been on a couple of very good ships, but the level of coordination on this one was simply outstanding. Feel free to add me as a contact and maybe someday we'll be able to put together a casting. This was a lot of fun.</p><p>As for me, I think I'll take a couple days off before jumping again so I can hit the road without scrambling to find decent WiFi every few hours or so. Safe travels to all of you, wherever the Daedalus might take you.</p>
