Let's start this, shall we? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> This time it will be short! I... <em>gigle</em> I promm... <em>even more gigles</em> I prommise! I prommise it will... <em>full blown laught</em> Ok! Ok! No more lying! It will NOT be short <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Forget it! No way it will be short. Ok? So read it only at Your own "risk" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Alpha Mush <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"> here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Later known as <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> due to transfer <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Oh my! What a ship that was! It lasted only 5 days and some cycles, but in that time it had more action than any of my other ships that I had! Ba! I am sure that it had more action than many of my ships had TAKEN TOGETHER! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> But let me start from begining...</p><p>I never play as Eleesha. I played her once and immidietly discovered that I had no connection to that character at all! So... There is question now - HOW ON EARTH I landed on that ship as Eleesha? <span class="tid_user tid_user_8436632 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8436632">technolass</span> convinced me some time ago that playing as Eleesha might be extremly interesting and that I should definietly try it at some point. I agreed on that, but I made condition - that if I will be Eleesha, than Technolass will have to try land on same ship as I AND will pick up Chun or Chao. New season has come, so Chao was out of game, but there was Derek, who took His place and... And my friend was lucky to not only get Derek in Characters Rooster, but also after picking him - landed on same ship with me! Yay! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Now... That alone was GREAT LUCK! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> We hit not only SAME SHIP but also exact CHARACTER MATCH!!! Incredible, right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Of course it was! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now... We have such agreement betwen each other that everytime we land together on same ship, we put diffrent RPing show for others. BUT! But I will leave RPing behind. It will be not a thread about RPing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It will be thread about ship and what was happening while it lasted. MAYBE! Maybe later on I will put some words about RPing. But not now. Nope <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong><em>Before Mushes were selected...</em></strong><br>So... Ship started rather calmly, with VERY active crew. Half of crew I knew, as they were part of our organized jump. But never mind that... What was important is that many things were already done by crew - banana plants were in its place, there was nice and organized INVENTORY THREAD, apron was in lab... Only thing that was missing was camera in Alpha Dorm. Another thing that could be done, but wasn't was Shower Dismantling. Nobody so far bothered to do it. <br>I know! I know! It is better to wait with it for Mush selection... Bla bla bla! Tell You what? If I could pick Tech, I would do so without second of hesitation and I would simply dismantle that Shower. But I could not!</p><p>WAIT! WAIT! WAIT! I forgot something! I forgot about my skillset! You have right to know after all... Right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> So... I played as Gold. But my Eleesha was lvl 1. Still I had pleanty of expirience - eoungh to advance Her to lvl 4 with hopes to get lvl 5 during said ship... If it would last more than 5 days <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> At begining, before Mush selection I picked <strong>Tracker</strong> (so obvious) and <strong>IT Expert</strong>.</p><p>Than I made everything what I could in order to burn those IT Points somewhere, and to get rid of some of my AP to not overflow during night time. I helped a bit with researching lenses and installed camera in Alpha Dorm. I also discovered that our <em>Raluca</em> picked up Grenade in Rear Bravo Storage. That was last thing which I manaded to do before Mush selection. It was already VERY late and I was going to go sleep. I informed crew about Raluca - they gave Her ultimatum. Either She puts away that grenade, or She gets reported and killed right after Mush selection. Raluca answered after some time and gave Grenade to Chun. And Her life was spared thanks to that. I will only tell that later on Raluca had VERY big impact on THIS AP I am writing now for You... To be precise, it's title are Her words <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Perfect citation! But... Never mind! Never mind! Let's go on with subject, ok? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So... Some AP burned, Three IT Points also burned... Time to go sleep, right? Sure! I go to Alpha Dorm, take bed ad go sleep both - in Mush and in Real.</p><p><strong><em>Something has changed... Agent of Mush! And how LUCKY!!!</em></strong><br>Allright... So I woke up early morning next day. It is time to go to work of course... But I alwas have little time to check what is going on my ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And so I log on... BOOM! You are agent of Mush!</p><p>My first reaction? WONDERFULL!!!<br>My second reaction? OH NO! I WILL HAVE TO PLAY AGAINST <span class="tid_user tid_user_8436632 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8436632">technolass</span> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> <br>My third reaction? DELIGHTFULL!!!</p><p>So now question to You my dear reader! What has happened? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Answer is simple <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Both! I and <em>Derek</em> were picked as Mush! So I no longer had to play against my friend! Quite opposing! We together were forming team that had to fight against everybody else! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Derek</em> was at that moment offline, but told me before that He managed to extract two spores and take stealth shower in BDorm. For me it was not that easy... I had only 10 minutes before going to work, and I could not find resonble way of getting dirty in that time. So I just decided to stand up from bed (to not get too much suspicios from others), report that there is open bed in Alpha Dorm after me and that I will be offinle for next 10 hours. I did also one more thing... Thing that was both - pain to deal with later, but in same time it was very helpfull in one paticular, and critical moment <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> You see... I immiedietly took <em>Observant</em> skill. By doing so I made it harder for my Mush partner to infect in my company AND I undercovered fact being Gold Player rather than only silver one <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Later on <em>Derek</em> told me that I did good think as <em>Chun</em> was wondering why I didn't took observer and was thinking it was rather suspicious to take IT insted of observer... And I immidietly contacted <em>Chun</em> and <em>Derek</em> in one channel, offering Her my help in investigation. How good of me, right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> How noble! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> And than I went to work...</p><p><strong>Note for all of You who read this - I very rarely fake inactivity. I usually remain very active, if not MOST active person on ships. This ship was diffrent in that regard! I did acted like inactive on few situations. I admit it!</strong></p><p><em>I think it is moment to end my history... For now! I will add next part tommorow AFTER I will return from work to home and will grab some rest. Which means around... 20 o'clock </em></p>

                <p>Hmmm... looking at the ship... crew bumped anti-Mush research, it was Antispore Gas or Mycoscan - I don't know which one, but it was useless anyway, judging by future infection, it wasn't CS nor MA... but research later was getting fast... ASG CS MA Mycoscan made in two days!... it was few cycles when Ian got killed by Roland and then Jin Su wasted by Gioele... projects were relayed even even - you got Fire Detector as second project... in the heat of the action and paranoia amongst human team, day after selection you got to spike someone, so you picked Frieda in the unsecured place. Eleesha used Infector spiking Frieda twice and Derek put a final spore and she was Mush... waited much more time, almost 2 days when Eleesha spiked probably Stephen anyway had to go. Later, Derek also spiked him and as he couldn't take Anynomush, left the job for Frieda who made it in that cycle after Derek visited. It was somewhere in the end of day... because things were happening... Eleesha made some grenades after finding them with free Observant skill, didn't have to use spore to transfer into Janice and put some grenade party (killing Hua, of course). Derek killed Roland and inactive Kuan Ti (I don't know why he did this... instead of Terrence, who Stephen tried but failed?) depressing inactive Paola to death, spiked Gioele a few cycles later and Stephen finished it. It didn't last such long, because in the next cycle Terrence killed him. Stephen and Janice declared a ceasefire connected together. They're getting caught, the only way was to repair PILGRED as soon as ceasefire is off and fly away. Frieda spiked Raluca and transferred into her, getting rid of her old body asking Derek. He ate his spores (which wasn't worth because of CS) and used all his power while mutating. Poor Raluca in Frieda's body... Stephen helped Raluca in doing PILGRED and done, but... Eleesha woke up alerting crew and slaughtered Stephen, Chun stabbed Raluca to death, Andie got rid of Derek... none of alive people had any spores, Janice tried (at least Fertile), but Andie put a stop to Mush Superiority. Waiting till Terrence comes back and Sol.</p>

                <p>Almost correct, but not quite. The conversions were all done blazing fast - in the case of my own conversion, it was done in less than 20 seconds, and Stephen's was similar. Stephen was chosen early as a possible target because of being confirmed human early on, and starting off with a spore, but he was extremely careful about remaining under cameras and so we chose Gio instead, who had already inherited Commander title and therefore had to expose himself on bridge. Gio spent almost 2 days inadvertently outwitting us - he moved too quickly on our first shot at him up on bridge, and we only managed to get one spike before he left. We then planned to finish him off while he was waiting in IB, but he moved literally 5 minutes before we were planning to move on him.</p><p>At that point we pretty much gave up on Gio and decided to finish Stephen's spiking, taking the risk of taking down the camera in Lab where he was currently standing. Someone had taken the apron to AD for whatever reason so under the guise of delivering the apron, I went to lab and took down the cam. Stephen logged in pretty much immediately after I took down the cam and I almost had a heart attack. We spiked, I took anonymush, replaced the cam, and the three of us spammed Lab logs with lab research and apron pickups. We then had a good few hours of Stephen feeding us info from the Mush hunt channels. It was Stephen who warned us that humans were planning to move on Derek immediately, so we decided to act quickly.</p><p>We decided to clear out AD, take all beds, and ceasefire for 3 cycles of undisturbed rest. At that point I believe it was Hua, Roland, Andie, Terrence (?) and KT in AD. Eleesha-Janice threw two grenades while the rest of us waited outside - Terrence came and hit Derek a few times. Hua died from grenades and Andie escaped in a patroller, injured I think (very quickly - nice reflexes Andie <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">), then the rest of us ran in. I claimed a bed, Derek and Stephen took out remaining survivors. We took out KT because he was an unknown factor, who never spoke and wandered around the ship doing whatever he fancied. It was also an extra hit to human morale. When the dorm was cleared, Janice declared ceasefire. Terrence took BD, Andie stayed in a patroller for a few cycles, and everyone except Raluca ran to medlab.</p><p>Shortly before our ceasefire ended, we decided to try and convert Terrence in BD (so he could finish Pilgred) and finally finish off Gio, but we weren't sure it was still Terrence staying in BD. So Derek and Stephen said they would go to medlab (where Gio was), via BD to confirm it was Terry. Me and Janice were supposed to enter immediately after we had confirmation, but Terrence left the second Derek entered. Stephen and Derek continued to lab, spiked Gio, and came back to BD, where second ceasefire was declared. The humans killed Gio shortly after, presumably wasting a significant amount of AP because judging by movement it took 3 people to kill him. Chun, Terrence, and Andie then went to IB, presumably waiting for a fourth human to secure themselves and regain AP. We decided that Terrence was now an unreliable target because of presumably low AP so we decided I should transfer into Ral instead, who was still in Nexus.</p><p>Transfer went through successfully and I returned to BD which was still under ceasefire. Nobody seemed to have noticed the possible transfer, until now-Frieda left Nexus and went to AD. For some reason, she didn't alert anyone immediately but we decided to kill her anyway. We waited a few cycles to regain AP in preparation for Pilgred. Derek and Jan got plated in the same cycle, leaving Derek dangerously low.</p><p>Me, Janice and Derek pushed Pilgred, while Stephen ran to the bridge. We decided he shouldn't give me the mission unless I needed it to finish (with reasonable luck I could have finished it without), but when I used all my AP and Pilgred was 1 bump from completion, I asked for the mission. This point right here is where everything started to go wrong <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Stephen had left his Trackie in a dorm, assuming that he could issue without it from the Bridge (or all of us simply forgetting to point out otherwise).</p><p>He couldn't <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So he had to run back to grab the Trackie, but that meant he had to spend the AP he had allocated for jumping to Sol. Seeing no other option, we decided he should go back for it and we could try to defend the bridge and buy enough time for him to rest a cycle on Bridge sofa. Me and Derek ran to FC, I guarded and Derek mutated. Sadly, Chun and Andie came through like avenging angels, stabbed us both to death, and set upon poor Stephen. They didn't manage to kill him but they broke his finger which meant he couldn't even lie down that cycle <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico">. Chun took the sofa. Eleesha turned up out of nowhere and finished off Stephen. Janice was left all alone in ER at 0/0, where she lasted long enough to manage to spike Terrence, but too late. Eventually she died as well and the 4 remaining humans were clear to jump back to Sol with the Pilgred we'd so generously repaired for them <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Even if we did lose, it was probably the most fun I've had in a game so far, and the human team worked very hard and efficiently to claim that win, so it was well deserved <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Chun here, survivor of a hopeless and most intense ship. X_X<br>Thanks Europa for those.. you know.. moments. =)</p><p>I'll try to answer some.<br>1. Why did Ian and Jin Su die?<br>Ian woke up, removed the camera in an instant and went inactive.<br>Jin Su was fed up with too much RP texts thanks to Eleesha and Derek and went berserk when people started ordering him. He gave the mission to Roland while our Andie was devoted on D2.</p><p>2. How the Mush hunt team was built and who participated?<br>No clue here. <br>The mush hunt team had mush, transfers and it went haywire. I had two channels going one focusing on research and the other from Derek and Eleesha who dominated the chat, pasting random logs and making my mind go haywire. I initially had to trust them since they were more communicative but they started to go/act inactive and I shifted my trust to Andie and Gioele. One primary mistake I made was that I had to blindly trust everything which was said to me. Derek went hiding the weapons before I came online. (my lack of experience)</p><p>3. Was Gioele solid and was Terrence shooter? I worked out that Roland was Shooter...<br>Gioele felt that Paranoid was useless and chose Junkie, (Maybe newbie here but I couldn't believe when half the crew convinced Gioele to not pick paranoid) Terrence was gold and we managed to give him Sprinter.</p><p>4. What was happening with the Knife and why the Mush didn't capture it?<br>Uh, clueless. That knife played an important role and helped us changed the game, without it we would have stood no chance.</p><p>5. What did make human suspicious of Derek?<br>The fact that he did nothing much, maybe?</p>

                <p>Judging by what Ian and Jin Su did, people don't go for a rage killing people solo without even asking Chun... especially Derek - nobody would fight solo him without Solid and Wrestler skills or without Knife. Blasters could be captured by Derek so needed multiple people to take him down and it wouldn't be done without consulting and discussing, moreover you said "maybe" so you just suspected him, but held him alive, which was enough to not make the rampage so early. About Knife...</p><p><em>Eleesha finds the Knife. She says to Chun that she couldn't resist and she's a bit paranoid that the Mush might hide all the weapon. Hides the Knife in other place than she claims to Chun... if Chun decided to take it and found out the Knife hadn't been there, Eleesha could tell Chun that she confused Bravo with Alpha or had taken it such time before... Problem with Knife solved.</em></p><p>Give Derek some actions. Stephen should've praised him that he relayed with research or projects (spamming with apron and research), treated some diseased plants... even shooting Ian would be AP-consuming after he spent some of them shooting at hunters from turret. Chun might doubt, but if Stephen, Eleesha and Derek himself confirm it, Chun has nothing to say. Andie should stay at research, Gioele help Andie. And infecting more and more people, you'd make a false image for Chun, that everything is fine and everybody does anything, mushrooms grow on Mush hunt team, poor Chun believes all their lies.</p>

Stephen (the first Beta to have been a confirmed human) wasn't converted until way after people started becoming suspicious of Derek, so couldn't vouch for him.<br>If Derek "shoots" from a turret (which is already suspicious in most cases, even before taking into consideration that we had 6 pilots), and another unconfirmed human confirms that, that's two people bumped up the suspects list. By the time I was converted I was probably already being watched thanks to RNG failing to give me any good O2 planets. Eleesha was forced to do comms work after Paola went completely inactive, putting her actions also under close scrutiny. So neither of us would have held much trust, and we would potentially be endangering ourselves as well.<br>Believe me, we tried for full-blown stealth conversion, but circumstances simply didn't permit it. It's one thing to say "You should have/could have...", with completely clear hindsight, but it's another to be able to pull those things off ingame with limited knowledge of other people's activity and suspicions. The most promising targets for conversion were also the most difficult - Andie and Terrence had extremely quick reaction times, Stephen was consistently under cams, and Gioele simply had a charmed life.</p>

All is based on my own memories. So expect what You CAN expect from that. Mistakes, inconstincensy... The usual stuff. Feel free to point out those and correct them if You can! That will be nice of You. Ok? Thank You from advance!</p>

                <p>Oh sorry, Europa, I didn't mean to instruct how to play perfect as Mush, I just don't get this one how Derek could get murdered in this case for reasons I have given.</p><p>About the whole story... I watched your link and bases on this link, I made the story in the evening because nothing to do I didn't want to sleep and I don't think before sleeping... looked Mush forum empty... your AP Thread I tried constructing how it has happened. Stepping forward too much I asked some questions I was curious...</p><p>And that likable, gentle and helpful... it sometimes happens on ships where I feel Mush free and the crew isn't doing anything terrible... and when I am Mush when crew doesn't know about me... I still remember these first ships when I was inexperienced and curious how that all everything worked, learning with comprehension, and a bit scared after the first killing human and second killing human that I could hurt anybody else so didn't kill Mush till I see revealed in logs their actions... Then I was a bit scared, especially when in our first ship Frieda suspected that Terrence was doing Mush tutorial and when you didn't manage to kill him, I finished with single punch... I was really scared, but it hasn't changed so far that I liked instructing people like in that ship I was telling the mistakes from previous ships and tried to not make it happen again.</p><p>When did it change? The missed Eden, when I had a suspect and knew some obvious people who weren't Mush but people were suspecting. I suspected just Raluca and a few people Chun marked as confirmed human from some sources I didn't get. They killed me and RFS'd Raluca I suspected all the time from the beginning, I crossed her plans in conjunction with Plasma Shield and the shower, and Stephen rudely killed me for holding the Medikit in the shower dorm if I even didn't take it to the Bravo Dorm never... then I learned hesistating leads to loss, I was becoming more paranoid in future ships and sometimes pathetic that something might go wrong, I couldn't believe that people were trusting me when I was Mush as Kuan Ti and killing me when I was human. Something said me that "It shouldn't be done, it's wrong, no this way" and I was arguing with crew how to make some things, if they didn't do something, I was doing it myself, not once I felt that I was the only person Mush hunting there when the rest was outing some opinions about people instead of giving information and thinking about purposes. This game was so stressful as once I played Chun noticed Paola left Bravo Dorm on half way recalled that she forgot to wash herself. Although she realyed research once, bumped half of Xyloph and Rebel Base, I stabbed her to death wasn't even minding that I'd get sanctioned by SDF because I counted that as last voyage played in Mush because I wanted to retire after all unbearable people who were ignoring my advices without even giving a rational argument. Then announcement appeared that the next season of Mush, Chao and Finola back, injuries in the start so I didn't give up and continued to frustrate. I haven't experienced the new season yet, so maybe I won't comment this until I experience, but after your ship I've become even more scared about this.</p>

                <p>Ok... So I am going to continue my story...</p><p>To remind You where we are in my story... I got selected as Alpha Eleesha, I did some stuff to look better, I burned some AP and let pilot have bed in ADorm. Moreover I took Observant to fend off some possible suspicions that could be over me due to being already IT Expert. I mean... Why would Mush take Observant? To screw His partner? I knew my partner was extremly competent and will take it into account. Still that skill was a little pain in our bottom in some cases <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So... I went to work, and informed Chun that I will return in about 10 hours (which is always truth - my timetable is kind of set in stone).</p><p>...............................................................................................................................</p><p>Ten hours later I do return... Finnally. And what I see? One dead humman already! Haha! It MUST be Raluca, for keeping that grenade... But... Guess what? Nope! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> There was TONS of RPing everywhere so getting through all of that was hard... But my dear partner - <em>Derek</em> was so kind that He made me shortened version of what is important. First research was done - <strong>CSerum</strong>. Well... My first Mush Skill was <em>Fertile</em> so it didn't affected me that much. Same goes for my partner. Still extracting two spores costed me now 4 AP insted of 2 AP. That is always something, right? And second important message was that... Ian just went down! That happened while I was in my work. Speacking of which - it was tiring as hell! Childrens were nasty! There were not many of US and more than usually of THEM! Aghr! &gt;.&lt; So I was also tired after I got home. Even more reasons why <em>Derek</em> was that nice and send me shortened version of what happened at that time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Thank You! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>What did Ian to get killed? He took Camera from Lab and was holding on it. And that lasted for some time. Long time. Very long time. So people got fedup with it and <em>Derek</em> with <em>Roland</em> put end to that.</p><p>AND! And maybe it is right time to say few words about it! Crew! Activity of our crew was enormous! But, apart of that there is always small amount of those who not fit in... Right? So we had our amounts of such people here also. <em>Paola</em> was biggest offender activity-wise. She was inactive. She camed to bridge and that was it. Not even finding Walkie-Talkie <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> <em>Kuan Ti</em> was second biggest offender activity wise - he stayed on Bridge for like three days, than suddenly He camed active and went to Alpha Dorm... And since than He was doing some creepy walks around. Nothing else really. But that is still better than <em>Paola</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> <em>Raluca</em> was third offenter activity wise. She was active few times during ship. She also upped PILGRED twice in row to 8% at begining. And helped in NEXUS on few occasions. All that made Her thrid least active person. But Her biggest and most renown action was... GOING TO SLEEP! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Hahahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> You will yet learn what it is about <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> There was also <em>Janice</em> that communicated only a bit, but did her job and DID communicated at all - even if just a bit. I think She was just kind of new and rather with smaller amount of time to spend.</p><p>Anyway... My first day as Mush will soon end (few cycles to finish) and I still haven't extracted any spores. That was irritating. I had to find way. Originally I planned to visit BDorm to collect logs for <em>Chun</em>... But that would be simply too cheap to pass on that ship. So decision has been made by and <em>Derek</em> (to be precise Derek suggested it, while I made in same time this plan on my own) that I should totally get dirty by setting up a SOFA on Bridge. So I wanted to "get some logs" for <em>Chun</em> WITHOUT getting into BDorm, and than use SOFA as excuse to be dirty. Plan was AP costly - 3 for SOFA, 0 for first spore and 4 for second one. So 7 AP total. But I was at full AP Bar, so no problem... I just had to look out for...</p><p>And suddenly my dear and sweet <em>Chun</em> asks me if I could put logs into spreetsheet insted of just pasting them into channel! Sure <em>Chunny</em>! No problem, right? Right?</p><p>There was problem. I HAD NO IDEA HOW TO MAKE THOSE SPREADSHEETs WORK PROPERLY! I never ever used them. I just learned how to do them and... Didn't had idea how those work really... I tried my BEST to make them work for <em>Chun</em> and for myself (good training is not bad thing - when Mush try to train how to hunt mush, right?). I might be doing mistake now... But I don't care. Look... I am teacher. I have patience for childrens and for people. I work with authistic childrens. So I have TONS of patience... For them. For others. For peoples. BUT I HAVE NO PATIENCE FOR COMPUTERS! You have no idea how that stupid spreadsheet annoyed me back than! I was so frustrated that I started to pull my hairs off (litelary - no exagerration here!). My mental health is non buissnes of Yours, so spare Yourself any comments with "golden advices" on that matter please. <em><strong>CHUNNY! CHUNNY!</strong> If You wondered was I seriously like that back than, or was it just drama made in order to confuse You or something like that... Well... Now You know - it was real frustration and anger. </em> And when I am angry I always do stupid mistakes... So here I "fight" with spreadsheets... And cycle change happens. BOOM!</p><p>ELEESHA! You are our new Comm Officer! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Perfect. Just perfect... Only possitive thing about that was getting more reasons to build SOFA. After all i was now building it for myself, right? So I - in my full anger and frustration about those spreadsheets - am going to make SOFA happen. I follow plan exacly. Dirty - 2 spores extracted! Entering Bravo Dorm and officially showering myself. Than returning to Bridge. Good. Really good. So where did I made stupid mistake? I took <em>Splashproof</em> unnecessary! I mean... WHY? That was stupid rush! One skill slot wasted! Because I was so frustrated... Because I could not think clearly... You know what? I could take for example phagocyte in that place! Or... Or... Mycelium Spirit! But NO! I took Splashproof. Ok. At lest I wasn't melting in shower. Always something. And from now on I was always on Bridge... Nearly always. With work that gave exacly ZERO reasons to get dirty. But I still had my two spores... And I had nasty, really NASTY surprise for everybody... <em>Infector...</em> With THAT we could just infect somebody on very first day (actually it was D2, but Mush selection happened at D2C1). And guess what? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> There was NO camera on Bridge! I was on other hand quite vocal about me being <em>Observant</em> and thush making myself kind of like camera. Reason was obvious - I wanted somebody to get wrong idea of Bridge being more safe than it really was. Actually it was not safe at all with me there...</p><p>Oh... And my frustration... It passed only after <em>Derek</em> was so kind to teach me how to make proper spreadsheets <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Otherwise I would be too frustrated and I would do something really stupid anytime soon... Good it didn't happened!</p><p>So... It is D2C?. I don't remember... I really don't remember. But I am sitting on Bridge with some AP regained after my hard work for <em>Chun</em> with logs... Nothing done on Comms... I plan to push some work on C1... In the mean time I am waiting on Bridge... AND SUDDENLY OUR "GLORIOUS" COMMANDER JIN SU STARTS TO ATTACK OUR CREW FOR BEING TOO ACTIVE!!! I mean... Come on! <em>Jin Su</em> I wish You from bottom of my heart that You will get only fully inactive crew from now on! I really wish You THAT! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I will not go into detials... But I took Gioele "on side" in one Channel... In another I had already <em>Frieda</em>... And what I did started? I started point fingers at our Comander. He refused to send mission to <em>Andie</em> who was our main (and only) researcher. Insted He send it to <em>Roland</em>. And He did it ONLY to show off that he may send them to whoever he want to. I knew who was <em>Gioele</em> and I knew that person can get really paranoic about things... So I started to push Him slightly to finish off Jin Su. Meanwhile I described scenario of JS starting rampage - very succesful rampage - to <em>Frieda</em>. I have no idea how it exacly evolved as amount of messages in my and Gioele's channel was too big to get through them. But nearly whole ship was invited in there at some point. And finnaly decision has been made... And <em>Jin Su</em> got killed for playing against His own team (sending mission to <em>Roland</em> who didn't needed it as was at nearly full AP, while Andie was empty of AP and could push research better. He also was threatening people to kill them and report if they will act against Him. Moreover He was holding bed in Bravo Dorm (how Mushy! ;P) while had also nearly full AP Bar. All in all he was prick and was playing against his team. Got reported and killed. And ship was better without Him. Too bad, because at very begining He seemed to be great player. Well... He was just a prick in the end.</p><p>He dig His own grave by His actions... But I made sure - by provoking Gioele and Frieda a bit - that this grave will get filled in soon <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And it worked really nicely <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Whole ship was involved in great drama over it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Still... Chances are <em>Jin Su</em> would have been killed off nevertheless without my intervention. But... Better safe than sorry <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong><em></em>OK! Late! Long! End of part 2!!! Part 3 tommorow on same time (hopefully). If not than I will give You word when.<em></em></strong></p>

                <p>anyway, I was Gio (I'm SO NOT reading all that... EVER. EVER. EVER &gt;.&lt;.) I was coffee junkie and took astro cause Frieda couldn't scan properly. what a useless old witch. (no offense). I'm not sure if there was an actual mush HUNT channel, I did try to participate but I was distracted by Jin Su (what a moron) (I'm making excuses) and other stuff (so not true I just sucked at the mush hunt) I did try to help Andie with research until JIn Su died at the end of my blade (good riddance). weapon hiding was... sucky. I had teh knife on me for about 3 entire days and I kept asking where Chun would liek to pick it up but.... it was forgotten every time (and now I see that my post is getting quite long). I'll keep it at this.

What did make human suspicious of Derek?</cite><p>1. He entered BD shortly after selection.<br>2. He was heavily underforming AP usage.<br>3. I noticed that Derek and Eleesha didn't want to kill JS as much as the rest of our group wanted. First of all no one wanted JS to stay alive and he didn't rampage so I figured out he must be human but he was a douche so he still had to die. The common psychological reaction as a mush in situation would be pretending to to be offline or <strong>minimally</strong> agree on killing JS. Derek and Eleesha went with 2nd because we knew they're online and it's less suspicious.<br>4. He visited Bridge to bring MycoAlarm there, this is when Frieda most likely got converted.<br>5. He wanted to go through entire ship with Apron to ER and load fuel while Raluca was in ER.<br>6. When he ate a ration he announced it on public channel.<br>7. He was switching sofa with Eleesha which was found out about 10-15 minutes before their rampage.<br>We had more than enough reasons to kill him earlier, it was a sloppy thing by us to hold so long into that.</p>

Thunder strikes from above as the pyro team triggers a facade of stunning visuals. Fire, fumes and spikes rush down on the Bridge, while the shimmering planet in the background adds to the scenery.<em> Here comes Hogan! Yeeeeeeah! </em>Beats himself in the chest, ready to rip his last shirt... Then suddenly realizes nobody is there, no one is watching, and generally no one even gives a damn.<em> Huh? Wha… Where did everyone go? </em>Hired cheerleader team disperses in disappointment.</span></span></span></p><p>So I was playing this big, dim, negligent character for the first time in my life. I always saw him as a ripped version of Chao with no really important skills... I was wrong <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"> 120 glory in the beginning of the game is something I got really used to during my time playing mush, so it wasn't surprising when I became a fungus <strong>ONCE AGAIN</strong>. But what was really surprising, is that my friend, which I promised to guide in playing my personal favorite character was alpa mush too. I couldn't believe my eyes.</p><p>MURICA is a disease, that proved to be worse than mush, so every ship start, I begin by securing weapons. I did my usual hiding and reporting to Chun (funny part, I never lied to our noble Chun, honestly telling her where I hid weapons, this is part of why she may chose to trust me) I also hid armor for her and later on passed her the knife. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"> Well, I also grabbed fertile, extracted 2 spores in the process and took a stealth shower. But who cares about that, really? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=":tid_clink:" class="tid_ico"> What was important, is that no griefer could cut up my great crew. <span class="tid_strike">I wanted that pleasure all for myself</span></p><p>Before we went on this voyage, I had to refuse my friend <span class="tid_user tid_user_8092972 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8092972">Aerial</span> to join him in our casting trip, because I felt I wouldn't have the time. That week was really busy for me, so I was hoping to get on a peaceful voyage, which I'll manage to do with my limited time. I was so mistaking <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>This ship was so RP intensive</strong>, I literally spend 3 hours reading all the messages that were spawned during my work hours. On day 2 amount or messages got to absurd 1300! Which ~equals to 50000 words. I had no time to play mush: <strong>I was reading a book</strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=":tid_clink:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>On many ships me and <span class="tid_user tid_user_8191292 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8191292">Europa</span> choose a special theme to roleplay.

She moves quickly, but noicelessly into His direction. After only few seconds She is just behind Him <em>Good... Let's see what little wrestler may do...</em> She quickly grabs His head with inhuman strenght and almost immidietly bites His neck strongly. Feel of warm blod starts to flow through Her mouth... Pleasant, sweet and metalic taste starts to embrace Her... And smell of spilled blood... Some drops are landing on floor, others are landing on walls, but most of it goes straight into Eleesha's mouth.<br><br><strong>Derek</strong> : Derek gasps, as he feels blood leaving his body so fast he could barely stand, if not for Eleesha’s tight grasp. Her hands are cold, like chromed foil of his soda can, which exploded in his hand while he squeezed it. Sharp teeth compressed his neck with predatorial nip, paralyzing his body completely. He felt life fading with lickwid dripping out of his punctured veins, his shoulder wet from blood.

                <p>weakestlink.. I was invited to the "mush hunt channel" even before I was conmfirmed (like many others). I think our biggest weakness was that we were too carefull. we discussed many many times about killing off Derek (mainly when weapons were mentioned....) but every time people felt that we didn't have enough proof. that's what it came down to. adn technolass... nice words "sniff". I feel so touched.</p>

                <p>Right... Story, story... Remember - not history! So there will be mistakes! So there will be things unnoticed by me etc...</p><p>Last time I ended up with how I manipulated <em>Gioele</em> and <em>Frieda</em> to cause <em>Jin Su</em>'s death. He dig His own grave with His pathetic behavior, and I believe He would have died without my influence UNLESS <em>Hua</em> would saved Him with Her rightfull "Ignore stupid troll" attitude. So I made just sure to counterballance that. Succes! With great drama our pathetic Commander was dead. What is really funny is that He had GREAT START in my book! At VERY BEGINING He gave me wonderfull impression of competence and expirience. First impresions are ofter wrong ones I guess <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But let's move on, shall we? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So... <em>Jin Su</em> is dead. <em>Gioele</em> was now new Commander. And this one stated that missions will be going to <em>Andie</em> at C8 as long as they will not have to go to somebody else due to emergency. But that was not important for us now. What was important was that we just decided who our first Beta Mush will become... Just remember - I was <em>Eleesha</em> and was doing Communication Officer's work. So I was stranded on Bridge. <em>Derek</em> - my fellow Alpha Mush was free to do what He wanted to (which ment showing off and do nothing). We decided that it will be best in this situation to infect somebody from Bridge personnel. There were only two problems - first was that we needed to do it in one go, so there will be already 2 mushes that are capable of going around ship. This problem was laughable at best! BOOM! Eleesha is now not only <strong>fertile</strong> and <strong>splashproof</strong> (DAMN YOU SPREEDSHEET!) but also <strong>infector</strong>. Which means we will easily finish off one humman together. So... Who it will be? Our choice fall on <em>Frieda</em>. Why? She was so far most reliable and predictable player. Always operating in same situation - full AP Bar ment going to scan planets. And <em>Derek</em> counted Her AP - She was soon to be at full AP and we expected Her next cycle to come on Bridge.</p><p>Now... For this reason <em>Derek</em> waited in Labolatory. Plan was that I will first put in two spores into <em>Frieda</em> and He will come in and finish Her off by giving third spore. Easy? EASY! Not so easy. Sorry. I said - there were two problems. One was that we needed to spike Her three times. Infector countered that part. But second problemwas my ver own skill - <strong>Obesrvant</strong> could discover <em>Derek</em> spiking <em>Frieda</em> and that would be death sentence for 3 of us really. So plan was that I will spike Her twice AND go into turret, than come back after conversion will occure.</p><p>DID IT WORKED OUT!? How do You think? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Were there problems? Did something camed into our way? Hahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Yes and no! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So we wait for that cycle change, knowing that <em>Frieda</em> will soon be at full AP and will have to scan planet... And here it comes! Cycle change! Yay! Hurray! Wonde... &gt;.&lt; Fires! Fire in Lab I think! Bah! And <em>Frieda</em> is at full AP. So what happenes? It is obvious! <em>Frieda</em> will want to take out fires rather than start scanning. She might even consider scanning in later cycle in such situation...</p><p>BUT our <em>Frieda</em> was actually better than that! She asked in main disscusion if we want Her to extinguish fire or procced with planet scaning. I was quick to answer only with words saying that fire might hurt us a bit, while lack of oxygene might kill us all pretty quickly.</p><p>And done! <em>Frieda</em> followed words of reason (I honestly think that was right thing to do for Her - we had <em>Derek</em> the <strong>Firefighter</strong> from that work). So... I went all stressed on Bridge, refreashing like crazy every 10 seconds or faster... My partner is doing the same... I had no iTrackie so could not see map... He saw it and was feeding me info... "Somebody in Bravo Bay!", "Somebody in Central Corridor!" and finnaly "SOMEBODY IN FRONT CORRIDOR!" and after those words I just saw 1 new log to show...</p><p>REFRESH! REFRESH! DAMN YOU! FASTER! FASTER! FASTER YOU OLD PILE OF... Here She is! Haha! Old witch! Quick action - check <em>Frieda</em> and hit buttons! Infect! BOOM! And again! Infect! BOOM! Frieda sporet twice and not a single log on that matter! Haha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> "<em>Derek</em>! Come in NOW! I am going out of Bridge!!!</p><p>......................................................SILENCE.......................................................................MORE SILENCE................</p><p>Refreash! Nothing. REFREASH! Still Noting.... REFREASH! BOOM! Third spore landed! Welcome in team <em>Frieda</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Yay! It worked! Now we only needed to make something about those logs of me going into turrets... BUT WAIT! Isn't there fire somewhere? I can just lie that I choose to check on both turrets if it is not in there... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Actually I can not. By that time somebody managed to finish off <strong>Fire Detector</strong> and we knew where fire is exacly. BUT! Why not claim that I looked if by any chance extinguishers are not there? So I reported that I checked both turrets for extinguishers. Silly? Yes. But in that state of enthusiasm and fear and stress that was best I could think off <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Derek</em> soon found extinguiser and dealt with fire. And <em>Frieda</em>? Well... She actually knew what was happening. She noticed logs of me going out of Bridge... But She also knew that She don't have needed time to report what is happening. And as She expected she got Her Mush Invitation message very soon <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Which was awesome <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Pretty awesome <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Totally awesome! Generally it is good to be bad! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Right? I mean... Come on! She WAS the witch! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Frieda</em> was great partner in Mush. She was totally best choice for our first Beta. She also had some nice skills to pick up (out of all mushes that were in play I was one with highest level and only one capable of Infector so none of that for Her, but still...). Moreover <em>Frieda</em> managed to steall <em>Terrence's</em> bed in Bravo Dorm. Oh! She also extracted and stealthshowered herself <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Right? I think so... Again! STORY! Not HISTORY! You want HISTORY? There are libliaries and books. Try some reading of those insed of my APs <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now... Going back with my memories it was really funny how one of first <em>Frieda's</em> questions were "You two are from some group or casting?" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Than She admitted that now She feels better knowing that She got converted by pair of organized members of casting group rather than by two totally random players <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Ok... So we have now <em>Frieda</em> and we started to have problems with Oxygene... But know this - we never ment to finish this ship by lack of oxygene. Sure - I and <em>Frieda</em> disscused once possibility to do so, but we never ment this as our "TO GO" plan. Rather "If things will start fall apart too soon." And even than we felt that this would be bit sucky ending... So nope. Not going for that. <em>Frieda</em> was expected to try Her best in order to find Hummans planet with oxygene AND to be ready for some spiking... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Ok! So... We do have <em>Frieda</em> now! What is next? More convesions of course! Hahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Silly question! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Our plan was to convert Commander <em>Gioele</em> next and <em>Andie</em> following day - 6AP from missions would be GREAT for Mush Team AND it would be done officially with everybody's agreement. But first <em>Gioele</em>...</p><p>AND HERE PROBLEMS STARTED TO SHOW UP! What problems? Oh... <em>Gioele</em>... If You would only knew... Worst part of all of that was that YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT! Aghr! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I am telling You all! <em>Gioele</em> was most difficult humman to infect actually! What strange in that? Well... We had 3 mushes that stationed on Bridge regullary... So Commander SHOULD BE ONE OF EASIEST TARGETS! Still You made yourself HARDEST TARGET!</p><p><strong>How? Why? Answer on this questions You will find out pretty soon! Ehm... Not sooner than tommorow evening that is <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Stay tuned for next episode! Hope You are having fun reading my story <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Again - this is story, not history. So if You find mistake of mine, or would like to add in something - by all means DO THAT! I strongly believe it will only enrich it. Have a nice evening everybody! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></strong></p>

                <p>So this is the second part of my story, as we continue it together with Europa.</p><br><p><strong>DAY 2 :</strong> <strong><em>ENTER ANDIE</em></strong></p><p><em>If I had an Arch-nemesis during this game, it was her</em>: <strong>Andie</strong> - shy, naive, tear spilling at every occasion, brown nosing like a true SDF officer, her roleplay was beautiful, and her actions were dangerous. Played by <span class="tid_user tid_user_8744424 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8744424">izpodtishka</span>, she caused more problems for mush, than anyone on this ship.<br><span class="tid_sideNote"><strong>Andie</strong> : But how am I supposed to keep myself neat and adorable as I am now than?!.. aaaaaw!<em> grizzles and pounts</em> if I won't be able to look nice, I won't be able to feel nice neither! And you wouldn't like that kind of me, that I know for sure!<em> flusters</em></span></p><p>She started the second investigation channel with <strong>Chun</strong>, the first one was started by me and Eleesha. I had even one additional channel opened with <strong>Chun</strong> right from the start before mush selection making sure poor <strong>Chun</strong> would be completely overwhelmed by information from all over the place.<br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Mush hunting thread<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/discrete.png" alt=":mush_chut:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><span class="tid_sideNote"><strong>Gioele:</strong> Why are we even keeping Andie in this chat? She is not confirmed or anything.<br><strong>Andie:</strong> I should remind you that it was me, who invited you all into this thread, so it's me, who is keeping you here! </span></span></span></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/zhong_chun.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_ZC:" class="tid_ico"> Our <strong>Chun</strong> was a seemingly new player <span class="tid_user tid_user_8946314 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8946314">KaHari</span>, but she was diligent, attentive, and tried her best to listen to everyone, and make the best judjement of things. Even though we really pealed her brain with random logs, info and ap counting, she managed to invent a quirky system by calling channels names, and requesting to be added to those channels when needed.<br><span class="tid_sideNote"><strong>Chun</strong> : I will never let any random killings happen in this ship so you don't need to prove your innocence to anybody except me. =)</span></p><br><p>After killing Ian, surprisingly, I was left with little to nothing ap, since I had to bring blasters and lenses to execute him, and hide them again. Even though I used only shooter points, I was still deprived from hiding weapons and spore extractions. Bridge was unprotected, and humans rushed research with <strong>Gioele</strong> doing all what he could, to progress it: relaying constantly, and pushing everyone to do the same. <span class="tid_sideNote"><strong>Gioele:</strong> Research is the most important thing right now! Period!</span>He got seriously fed up with <strong>Jin Su</strong> not giving <strong>Andie</strong> a mission, who was the main specialist there, while <strong>Stephen</strong> and <strong>Chun</strong> trying to give her enough relays.</p><p>It was a busy day in the office for me, and while I was doing my best not to fail ongoing schedule, a huge dispute arouse around our commander's persona. I was unable to partake in this dreadful discussion, while working and teaching my mush partner the correct way of saving room logs in google sheets. But Eleesha quickly saw potential willingness of human crew to kill <strong>Jin</strong> and worked her way into <strong>Gieole's</strong> and <strong>Frieda's</strong> private channels. <strong>Jin Su</strong> quickly died, killed by his crew for being a hardass. Unfortunately, <strong>Gioele, Terrence</strong> and <strong>Stephen</strong> all got sick. So commander gave his last service on this ship by confirming a huge amount of humans. <strong>Roland</strong> was also sick while killing <strong>Ian</strong>.</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">meanwhile: mush hunting channel&nbsp;<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/discrete.png" alt=":mush_chut:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><span class="tid_sideNote"><strong>Andie</strong> : So the list of suspects reduced to Janice, Eleesha, Raluca, Paola, KT, Hua, Derek (unlikely), me (even more unlikely)<br><strong>Chun</strong> : I can't even control this crew.. =/</span></span></span></p><br><p><strong><em>FIRST BETA</em></strong></p><p>So here it comes to our first beta. Mycoscanner could be completed any moment that's why I was absolutely against single spore infections, to avoid humans tracking us down. Bridge was unprotected, so our target was obvious. <strong>Frieda</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"> ALERT: <strong>Gravity simulator damaged</strong> - this is what happened on cycle change, just the moment Frieda was supposed to come to the Bridge and be infected by mush. Fire broke out in the Lab and there was no extinguisher in sight. And a yellow dot on my tracker moved out of the dorm...</p><p>My parther <strong>Eleesha</strong> had no trachike, so she was completely dependent on my report. <strong>Frieda</strong> came to the lab asking the crew what to do. I came in from the medlab and tried a few times to extinguish the fire without extinghusher: kids, never try this at home. It works horribly. <strong>Eleesha</strong> reassured <strong>Frieda</strong> that scanning now is more important, and I was already on the case, so our talented witch ventured forth to get her double spike on the Bridge. I bragged in the main channel "Where's da' bloody extinguisher" and went "looking" for it to the Bridge. <strong>Frieda</strong> was finally converted <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_1820123 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1820123">metaveil</span> <em>in the mush channel</em> : <span class="tid_sideNote">I knew I was screwed the moment Eleesha moved to the turret, but figured it would be suspicious to leave without finishing the scans.</span></p><p><strong>Frieda</strong> was warmly welcomed to the family. She took <em>Fertile</em>, <em>Splashproof</em>, grabbed a spore and went into the dorm. <strong>Terrence</strong> fixed gravity simulator, I extinguished the fire.</p><p>After <strong>Frieda</strong> we really wanted to convert <strong>Stephen</strong>, because he was confirmed human and already had one spore. With me and <strong>Frieda</strong> each having 1 spore, we could convert him by ourselves.</p><p>First plan was to convince <strong>Gioele</strong> to take <em>Victimiser</em> as his second silver skill, make him put a pariah on already suspicious Janice, and after the next day when <strong>Frieda</strong> would totally fail to find oxygenated planet, make <strong>Stephen</strong> apprentice <em>Astro</em> and go to the Bridge to scan.</p><p>That one was quickly scrapped, because <strong>Janice</strong> got a disease, and <strong>Gieole</strong> grabbed <em>Astro</em> himself. It was apparent who we were going to convert next.</p><br><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">DAY 4 during rampage discussion</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><span class="tid_sideNote"><strong>Gioele</strong> : you are a failure as an astro girl, at least i found us some O2...<br><strong>Frieda</strong> : Yes, at least everyone can breathe deeply while we'll be killing you all.</span></span></span></p><p><em>End of part 2</em></p>

                <p>Allright! I will try my best writing this episode <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So... As You remember there was I (<em>Eleesha</em>), Techno (<em>Derek</em>) and Meta (<em>Frieda</em>) who has been Mushes. <em>Eleesha</em> and <em>Derek</em> were alphas, while <em>Frieda</em> got converted in matter of few seconds on bridge, when She tried to perform nice planet scann <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now I will write what happened next... BUT! Firstly I must admit that I totally forgot to mention (I didn't forgot about event itself, I just forgot to mention it in my previous episode) our short-lived plan of manipulating our <em>Gioele</em> into taking <strong>Victimizer</strong>. For everybody who was on that ship, existence of that plan could be proved by... By one message made by <em>Derek</em> that slightly suggested that with <em>Eleesha</em> being glued to Comm Officer's job, He could use a help from somebody, and that <strong>Victimizer</strong> would be wonderfull to limit Mushe's actions. We all agreed that it will be best to make <em>Janice</em> to be our little <strong>Pariarh</strong>. But there was one big problem... <em>Janice</em> got comfirmed to be humman. She got mental illnes that was leaving logs. So it was proven that She was humman.</p><p>Actually... This ship was getting comfirmed hummans at ALARMING RATE!!! Honestly - it was happening faster than it would if crew woul food test themself! It lasted only 4 days, and in that time more than half of crew got comfirmed via diffrent means! And yet NOT A SINGLE FOOD TEST!!! This was really stressing for mush team. This also means that on avarange we got more than 1 comfirmed humman per day... Really - RNG was very ugly for us... I bet it was some kind of tax that it decided to take from us after it made Me and Techno both Alpha Mushes <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway... Idea of making <em>Gioele</em> <strong>Victimizer</strong> and <em>Janice</em> <strong>Pariah</strong> was destroyed completly, as we had absolutly no other valid target. Others were either inctive, comfirmed hummans or too competent and helpfull to be taken seriously as possible <strong>Pariarhs</strong>.</p><p>In that case we choose to go with simple, yet effective <em>Gioele </em>conversion. Same way as with <em>Frieda</em>! Exept that there were now 3 of us, so I didn't had to use THAT much AP for this to work. And we could spread AP usage more efficiently. So... Where was problem lying? First our problem was that I needed to extract spores in order to be able to infect <em>Gioele</em>. That alone was not a problem, but how will You explain Comm Officer to get dirty? No way of doing so... This has been solved by <em>Derek </em>asking me to collect some logs for Him... You see, there was an accident in Alpha Dorm! Camera broke out! So He used that event as an excuse for me to do quick logs run. Of course I did visited Bravo Dorm and... <strong>WAIT! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> No, no, no! This was otherwise! Totally otherwise! SORRY! My mistake!</strong></p><p><em>Gioele</em> camed on Bridge! He was standing RIGHT THERE! Perfect opportunity for 3 spikes! <em>Derek </em>had one spore, <em>Frieda </em>had one spore... Only I had to take one! And <em>Gioele </em>would be turned Mush right away! Even BETTER! Frieda had legitimate reason to visit Bridge! She was having full AP Bar and needed to burn it on planet scans <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Perfect situation! But still - main problem was the same! I needed to go to BDorm to shower myself after extracting spore. So that was plan for us... Firstly <em>Derek</em> asked me to collect some logs because of that camera problem. After that <em>Frieda</em> had to "shout" that I should wait a bit as She is comming on Bridge with Scooter for me (which was true BTW). I would go out into FC, extract spore there and than come back on Bridge for said Scooter (while spiking <em>Gioele </em>once) and than go on my "collect Logs" mission. Now is the question for You... WHAT WENT WRONG?! Why we didn't done it? Come on! Try to answer it in Your heads firstly, and than check on rest of my post! We will see if You got what went wrong...</p><p>You see... It was D3. Spores that we used to convert <em>Frieda </em>were extracted during D2, but infection itself occured at D3C1... So I went into that damn FC, extractes spores (making myself dirty!!!) and camed back on Bridge for Scooter and... AND NOTHING! I could not do a damn thing to <em>Gioele </em>- could not infect Him... I had to go on just like in plan and collect those logs for <em>Chunny The Chun</em>. Ok! Spore was mine and were't going anywhere, but occasion to convert <em>Gioele </em>was "lost". That was first time when <em>Gioele </em>managed to dodge conversion.</p><p>But we crafted new plan already - we wanted to infect Him right after day change. But problem was <em>Gioele </em>wasn't going to wait for us there, on Bridge. Sure, I was <strong>Observant</strong> and as such could make potential mushes to be affraid of spiking in my presence, but that is only 25% So our <em>Gioele </em>wasn't going to idle on Bridge too long. To make that more of an option, <em>Derek</em> helped with MAlarm Research and put one MA on Bridge. That gave Him also reason to stay on Bridge. Oh! And <em>Frieda </em>lost Her connection suddenly and was offline - that ment <em>Meta </em>had to stop using <strong>Plug In</strong> in order to avoid being "tracked down". And so our Mush vs Hummans battle got extended over Plug In channel <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Anyway - all three of us just waited on that Bridge for Day Change to spike <em>Gioele</em>! All 3 of us at once... After <em>Derek </em>picking up MA of course!</p><p>Guess what? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <em>Gioele </em>went out of sudden into one of Dorms &gt;.&lt; And He did this at around C8. THAT WAS SECOND TIME HI DODGET CONVERSION!!! And so after day change we were left with nothing acomplished apart of having one spore for every one of us.</p><p>But there was still hope yet! While on Bridge <em>Gioele </em>made good planetary scan and we knew that He will HAVE to move us to that planet. So we waited patiently for Him to come back... And each of us had 1 spore ready... And we waited... And waited... Untill <em>Gioele </em>made big message! What was on that message? What was it? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Why? Of course it was "I am going to be online during XXX time". &gt;.&lt; Seriously? Like this? We don't even know when exacly He will come to move ship?</p><p>We really wanted to get <em>Gioele </em>in so we choose to just stay and wait... Some of us took some sleep while they could... BUT THAT WAS LITTLE SLEEP AND LOTS OF WAITING DURING NIGHT TIME!!! &gt;.&lt; Guess how long have we waited? 4 hours! YES! DAMN RIGHT! We waited 4 hours - constantly refreashing every 10 seconds. Not all of us that is - sometimes I was doing refreshing duty, sometimes Techno and sometimes Meta. We could not use Plug In so hummans will not see us being online... So we just sit there, waited and talked about everything and nothing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I must say that it was so far strongest team-building expirience I had in Mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Oh! We also observed <em>Kuan Ti's</em> Creepy Walks and <em>Janice</em> being scared of Mush Traps in Rear Storage Rooms/ Engine Room. Last one was pretty funny <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I mean... Imagine us - three Mushes are stayng on Bridge, and in same time Janice goes into Engine Room to check if fuel has been put into and is mentioning that She is affraid of Spore Traps THERE! In Engine Room! At second end of ship! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> From our perspective it WAS fun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway, after 4 hours of active waiting and refreashing page we did noticed some movement. It was <em>Gioele</em>! He was puting in fuel and going to move ship (remember that <em>Jin Su</em> was dead). So we were ready... Only two things were not right - MAlarm was in Bridge, which ment <em>Derek </em>will have to pick it up before anybody will start spiking. And second was that I was <strong>Observant</strong> <em>Eleesha</em>, so I had to SPIKE and run away into turret. But apart of those two things all was well... BOOM! <em>Gioele </em>enters Bridge! I see <em>Derek </em>picking up MAlarm, so I spike! And quickly out of Bridge! GO! GO! GO! Ok! I am in turret! Now <em>Gioele </em>will finnaly become Mush! WRONG!</p><p>So... What THIS time went wrong?! Answer is simple - <em>Gioele </em>wsa too fast. He went out of Bridge before I did so! How come that You didn't noticed <em>Derek </em>picking up MAlarm is mystery for me still! But You didn't and that was made right in front of You! Anyway - <em>Gioele </em>got 1 spore inside... But managed to escape His fate. For THIRD time!!!</p><p>But we had expedition planned! So He went into IB and waited there. He made it crystal clear WHEN he will return, so that expedition will be finished before that time, so He will be able to move ship out of orbit...</p><p>Plan was simple - wait untill expo will be finished, and than <em>Derek </em>with <em>Frieda </em>will wait even longer - few cycles and THAN they will both go into IB and spike Him. Easy? Easy!</p><p>What did went wrong than? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Look! <em>Gioele </em>comed online faster than expected! To be paticular He camed in 10 minutes BEFORE action started! Do you get it? 10 minutes!!! <em>Gioele</em>! Should You come online 10 minutes later, you would see Mush Popup after logging in! But You didn't... By comming those 10 minutes earlier You managed to dodge conversion fourth time!!! You were by far most frustrating person on board <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Congratulation! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Ok! Time to finish this one! Hope You liked it and are waiting for more! Tommorow I will hopefully write down last part. I will at lest try <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

The plan was to spike Gioele when he comes to the bridge, <strong>Eleesha</strong> would fake getting some logs for our "investigation", which would let her exit Bridge, take out a spore, "remember she forgot scooter <strong>Frieda</strong> would bring her", come back, spike, and move out, letting us finish the job. Unfortunately that failed because we forgot <strong>Ellesha</strong> already spiked twice today. At least she grabbed a spore.</p><p><em>Meanwhile...</em></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Human Channel<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/discrete.png" alt=":mush_chut:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><span class="tid_sideNote"><strong>Andie</strong> : Ehm..guys..KT is in AD (which is with a broken cam in case anyone forgot)<br><strong>Roland </strong>: 100% camera was greenjelled.

So <strong>Frieda</strong> had to just went offline right there in the Bridge, to actually have a reason being there when he comes back. So we were waiting.

It's a miracle he didn't scanned himself after visiting Bridge. But we knew he will, and we couldn't have it. So he <em>promised</em> againg he would come at specific time. But this time we were smarter. We would spike him in Icarus 3 hours before that.

                <p>Allright! Finnal act is comming to You! I know You have waited long <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And trust me - I really did my best to make it short story <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Just look! It is kind of short! Right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So... Our plan to get <em>Gioele</em> was lost. He moved into Bravo Dorm. We were left with nothing in the end... Exept we still had two mushes that are ready and able to spike on that day. And both had spores. Hmm... What to do?</p><p><em>STEPHEN</em> was the answer! He was staying alone in Lab. Camera protected Him, but that was not a problem. All that we needed to do is to take it off before spiking, right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Well... No. Not right. There were some other things that needed to be done. Like make loogs litter a bit so that taken camera will be less visible... Still it was not much of work! And! Stephen had 1 spore already on since begining <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So it was easier job!</p><p>So <em>Derek</em> and <em>Frieda</em> enter both Lab, take out that annoying camera and... AND <em>STEPHEN</em> COMES ONLINE!!! Hahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> They were just fast eoungh to finish conversion off before anything has happened <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So... Only few seconds and we got <em>Stephen</em> in our team. That was MOST IMPORTANT CONVERSION WE DID! <em>Stephen</em> was comfirmed humman since long time. He had <em>Chun's</em> ear, and knew all plans. Moreover nobody suspected <em>Stephen</em> to be converted by Mush! <em>Eleesha</em>, <em>Derek</em> and <em>Frieda</em> - we all have been suspected, even if <em>Frieda</em> to lesser extend, but still!</p><p><em>Stephen</em> was also part of Mush Hunting chat! And THAT was best of it all <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Derek</em> with <em>Frieda</em> and <em>Stephen</em> made quickly some actions in Lab to "hide" logs comfirming that camera has been taken down and put again. We knew that <em>Andie</em> or <em>Terrence</em> would not fell on that one, but we hoped that everybody else will! And honestly I bet we were right, no matter what You will say now. I bet it would have worked on everybody else on that ship! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In this time <em>Stephen</em> started to feed us with info and comfirmed what we have been affraid off since some time... <em>Derek</em> and <em>Eleesha</em> were top suspects and we were planned to be killed soon. First <em>Derek</em> and maybe later on <em>Eleesha</em>. I bet that only things that could have saved my life would be getting ill after seeing <em>Derek</em> being killed. But as Mush - I would not get ill no matter what! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Worse! Things started to escalate quickly - <em>Terrence</em> comed on Bridge and noticed that I and <em>Derek</em> were exchanging beds AND that I did NOTHING with comms work. Since last NERON Update I haven't thouched it at all! We wondered if it would not be good idea to insta convert Him back than... But we had diffrent plan to execute and we needed every AP that we had. Also we hoped to get one more cycle change...</p><p>Unfortunatly that didn't happened! Hummans were determined to kill off <em>Derek</em> and me later on. And they were more and more determined to do that ASAP. After some time, <em>Stephen</em> feed us finnal info - we had 15 more minutes to act. After that hummans were going to just come on Bridge and finish us off.</p><p>From that point things went like lightning!!! Plan was already formulated! I have no idea how it went for others, but this is how it went for me...</p><p>Oh god! Oh god! F..K! Too slow! Too slow! Ok! Ok! I am in Front Corridor... SEARCH! <strong>Grenade Found</strong>. Splendid! And not a single AP used on that (<strong>Observant</strong>). Ok! Time to get <strong>Grenede BP</strong>! Going through Medlab... <em>Chun</em> is sleeping here... She is so beautifull when sleep... She is...</p><p>DEAR READER! <em>Eleesha</em> and <em>Chun</em> had some romantic affair with each other earlier on... This will be keept private. You just know that Chunny got some more RPing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So I go out of Medlab and went to Turret... SEARCH! <strong>Found it!</strong> Haha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And than straight for oxygene and fuel in order to get BP turned into greanade. Good! I am good! One greanade Should be taken by <em>Frieda</em> into AB. I managed to build second one... Ok! I am in Rear Corridor... Easy... Easy... OMG! I am too slow! Whole chat is lightened by new messages! Things are going on and I AM NOT THERE! Fast, fast... Ok. I will leave grenade HERE (Rear Corridor) and I will close all channels... Deep breath in... Ok! Into Bravo Dorm! Got into... Hmm... <em>Gioele</em>, <em>Terrence</em> and <em>Janice</em> are there. <em>Janice</em> was my personal aim! My <strong>Transfer</strong> subject! Fast! Before She will run away! SPIKE! Got it! Oh... <em>Gioele</em> just woke up and I got one hit from knife... <strong>TRANSLOCATE</strong>!! Yay! It worked! And seems like <em>Eleesha</em> got second hit from <em>Gioele</em>. Will serve Her well! I have work to be done! I need to... WHAT?! Only 4 AP and little MP? Grrrr! Ok! Must be eoungh! To the Rear Corridor again! GO! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Uff... Not a scratch on me yet! Picking up Grenade... Where to go? Where to go? Ah! Alpha Bay! <em>Frieda</em> should have left there Grenade for me... Second one... One that I found in Rear Corridor! But how? Through Alpha Bay 2 or through Alpha Dorm? Ok! Screw this! No time to thing! Going through Alpha Dorm. Ok! <em>Hua</em>, <em>Roland</em>, <em>Andie </em>and <em>Kuan Ti</em>! Now to the Alpha Bay... Yay! <em>Frieda</em> just dropped Grenade for me. Good coordination Meta! Come on! Come on! Pick it before somebody else will... GOOD! Haha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Got them both! Wait! I still didn't picked up skill... Hmm... Only one important skill has <em>Janice</em> for me... <strong>Diplomat</strong> taken! Good! Still at full HP! Going into ADorm... Two grenades... <strong><em>BOOM!!! BOOOOOM!!!</em></strong> <em>Hua</em> is dead! But I got only 1 AP left... Need it for <strong>Caste Fire</strong>!!! HEY! EVERYBODY! Come into ADorma and finish off everybody who You can! I have only 1 AP to fire CF and that will be it! Ok! <em>Derek</em> in.... <em>Stephen</em> and <em>Frieda</em> also! Good! More hummans dead! All beds secured... <strong><em>CASTE FIRE!!!</em></strong> Ok... One last bed... Good! I took it! Yay! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So... We managed to capture Alpha Dorm for ourselfs, killed bunch of hummans and I fired Case Fire. Now <em>Stephen</em> used His <strong>Apprentice</strong> in order to coppy my <strong>Diplomat</strong> for furutre use... <em>Hua</em>, <em>Roland</em> and <em>Kuan Ti</em> were dead. <em>Andie</em> managed to run with Her life.</p><p>Now... In accordance to our plan we had 3 cycles of rest... We could finnaly take some nice sleep... Oh! Wait! One important thing has happened! <em>Stephen</em> had to drop His iTrackie in order to secure an Apron so hummans can not finish Spore Sucker... But apart of this nothing has really happened during that time.</p><p><strong>3 cycles later</strong></p><p>Here we all woke up from our beds, and just before cycle change we went to take from hummans Bravo Dorm. We planned to convert <em>Terence</em> and <em>Gioele</em> during that. I entered Dorm but <em>Terrence</em> managed to run away before any spore was lied on Him... In same time <em>Derek</em> with <em>Frieda</em> finished off <em>Gioele's</em> conversion. He already had one spore from me, now it was just formality for two other Mushes. Moments later <em>Stephen</em> comed into Bravo Dorm and declared Case Fire for us. We could again feel safe... And gather more AP...</p><p>And here we started to have one nice idea... What about... Returning to Sol WITHOUT infecting <em>Terrence</em>? <em>Raluca</em> was still alive, and was in Nexus... You see... When our "rampage" started, She just said one thing in Mush Hunting channel - "I go sleep". Nice one, heh? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Anyway - our <em>Frieda</em> went for Mr. Cat, brought it into Bravo Dorm. Lowered Her HP to 3 or 4 (don't remember) and went into nexus. Spiked Her once and transferreed. Now we had our <strong>Phys/Tech</strong> expert from PILGRED! No longer need to convert <em>Terrence</em>! And we still had plenty of time till Case Fire will finish...</p><p>Finishing it in next message TODAY! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

I will do notice You even without vampy lips <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"> I promise! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So... As I told before, <em>Gioele</em> was converted by <em>STEPHEN</em> (not by <em>Frieda</em>). Unfortunatly <em>Gioele</em> was quickly killed by <em>Terrence</em>. Still... Next Commander was our wonderfull and brave (and always noticable) <em>Stephen</em> so we had all pieces that were needed in order to get this ship moved to SOL insted of having to kill whole crew. We had commander to return ship. We had <em>Raluca</em> in order to repair PILGRED... Nothing else was needed really <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now! We could have easily just move in and kill all remaining hummans. They had NO chance to defend agaisnt that! Sure, they could kill some of us, but our assauld on them could start with convering one of them, and killing rest of them after. However that would be rather dull way to end it. Why should we do that when we had also guaranted return to Sol? Hmm? We choose to pursue most interesting WIN scenario.</p><p>Plan was simple - in middle of Second Case-Fire cycle we will move out of dorm, set up PILGRED and than <em>Stephen </em>will get to Bridge and return us to Sol.</p><p>PROBLEM! Stephen didn't had much AP, so no help from Him in working on PILGRED. No big deal! Than <em>Stephen</em> will go on Bridge straight away. No problem with that, right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Easy! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>PROBLEM nr.2! <em>Raluca</em> don't have AP to finish PILGRED repair with Her current AP. Well... Actually She could should She get VERY lucky, but that is not something we will plan for! Solution was simple... She needed 2 more AP! <em>Stephen </em>could done that by sending mission! And He still would have AP to return us to SOL <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Oh... All problems seemed to be taken care off... But one tiny thing has been pointed out - WHAT if Hummans will retaliate and will kill <em>Raluca</em>? That mission could come in handy for <em>Derek </em>or <em>Janice </em>insted in such situation. Chances for that happening were extremly low honestly, but we decided to play it carefull... Insted of sending mission STRAIGHT AWAY while still in BDorm, <em>Stephen</em> was ment to send mission to <em>Raluca</em> when She was out of AP and when <em>Stephen</em> was on bridge already. Easy? EASY! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> WHAT COULD HAVE GONE WRONG SERIOUSLY? NOTHING, RIGHT? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And yes! There was ONE thing that went wrong... One simple thing... One about which we had no idea about...</p><p><em>Derek</em>, <em>Raluca</em> and <em>Janice</em> went into Engine Room and started repearing PILGRED. <em>Raluca</em> unfortunatly needed that mission from <em>Stephen</em>. And than everyting started to go wrong... <em>Stephen</em> could not sent mission to <em>Raluca</em> without having iTrackie. YES! EVEN WHEN ON BRIDGE!!! So He had to go into Alpha Dorm, pick it up, go back on Bridge and than sent it. We managed to repair PILGRED. I was totally out of AP (no AP and no MP). <em>Derek </em>and <em>Raluca </em>managed to make ti into Front Corridor. <strong>Derek </strong>mutated to become FC Guardian. <em>Raluca </em>just started to GUARD that place. But two Mushes guarding FC were not eoungh - <em>Andie </em>soon comed online and together with <em>Chun </em>managed easily kill both of them. Later they two managed to hurt greatly <em>Stephen</em>. Suddenly <em>Eleesha</em> comed online and finished off <em>Stephen</em>. From that moment only I was left as Mush. I could not do anything really... SO my plan was simple - I will try to infect <em>Terrence</em>. I had 2 spores on myself... I was <strong>Infector</strong> and <strong>Fertile</strong>. Only thing I needed back than was to manage put spores on <em>Terrence </em>AND survive to another day! Should that happen I would easily converted <em>Terrence </em>to Mush.</p><p>Well... I didn't managed THAT! But I did put 2 spores on Him! In Alpha Dorm! UNDER CAMERA! Listen! He camed in with idea of killing me... THAN SUDDENLY LOGS SHOWED THAT I AM SPIKING HIM TWICE! <em>TERRENCE</em> were no longer THAT brave! His Blaster didn't helped anymore suddenly <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> He run away into darkest turret and spend them litelary 30 minutes while doing nothing!</p><p>But than <em>Andie </em>comed to me and with few punches She finished me off, just like the rest. That was end. In matter of few cycles Hummans returned to Sol claiming their WELL EARNED VICTORY. They earned it by NOT SURRENDERING and trying till very end. And THAT is true spirit! None of teams had surrendered no matter of how bad was their situation. Fight was till the very end.</p><p>This is where my story ends. But there are other points of views! There are questions maybe? Well... That is still open for discusion <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It was very fun and good ship in the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Had great pleassure playing it! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Ok, now it's my turn to tell a story.<br>Meet the <strong>Stephen</strong>, all teams failure! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><strong>PART 1. HUMAN.</strong></p><p>I woke up one of the first, but there already were Chun and Hua (and some braindead folks as Paola and KT). It's always a big "hurrah!" for me to see an active Chun or Eleesha, probably because that's pretty rare thing.</p><p>I decided to RP an enthusiastic, not-so-smart but very nimble Stephen. It was never my intention to RP Satan's buddy. But! I always go with the flow in my RPing. So when I've started a dirty thread with the words "I am dirty as Satan!", I didn't actually mean anything. Just couldn't find any good comparison. But then things started to escalate quickly. Terry accused me in that I have an imaginary friend or that I probably have a split personality. Well, okay - I thought, - so be it! Unfortunately, my saved logs suddenly appears not so saved (NOOOOOO!!!), so I have almost nothing to show you. Maybe this little fight for Andie's soul:<br><span class="tid_sideNote"><strong>Stephen :</strong> Can you share your boa or whatever you have on you neck, Andie? We need some toilet paper in the Dorms.<br><strong>Frieda : </strong> Don't worry, Gioele just ordered a whole bunch of silk for that.<br><strong>Andie : </strong> But it's not a paper! And it's so diligently starched it could scratche your..eemm.. sensitive bodyparts.. And I can't let that happen, no! clenches fists <br><strong>Andie : </strong> For what? For Mr Rinaldo? Oh! Oh no! No no no! But we've already had a deal! And now you're helping him more than I do! Uuuugh...noooo.. and tears come up again <br><strong>Stephen : </strong> Shush, child. Don't listen to them. Listen only what's Satan tells you. He is never wrong. <br><strong>Andie : </strong> Oh, is he?! He must be cool than! I surtainly have much to learn from him! But..but I.. don't hear him.. bites lips convulsively Am I doing something.. wrong?.. Please don't say I do! flusters <br><strong>Frieda : </strong> Don't worry about not hearing him, that's what the LSD's for, deary. <br><strong>Terrence : </strong> We need an exorcist, quick. This is getting out of hand. <br><strong>Andie : </strong> Oh! Sounds awesome! Are they some kind of an.. an aerophone? Will I also hear something else? Will I hear crickets? Will I hear the dolphins? Ohh!..sweeeet!..rubs hands <br><strong>Andie : </strong> Oh no! Mr Archer! But the dolphins! You can't do this to me, pleeeease! tears, lots, lots of tears are streaming <br><strong>Stephen : </strong> Terrence, look what you've done! She is in tears! And you want to say Satan made her cry?! NOPE. Could he make her feel better? YEP! We should search for all the ingredients Sa.. Frieda told us about asap! Satan will lead us to a new, pure Eden. And not a single pathetic mush would stop us on that journey! <br><strong>Terrence :</strong> This heresy will come to an end. Terrence puts his secret inquisitor hat and cape on Fear not Andie and don't listen to their lies, your current state is all effect of Satan's hexes. We can still cure from you terrible state. Terren throws a mysterious pill into bottle of water. Here, take this, it will make you numb eno... cough cough, this will protect you from witch's cursed magic and you will be able to hear dolphins. <br><strong>Andie : </strong> Cure? But I'm not ill! I feel awesome! And guys..you know..I'm starting to think you're trying to trick me with al that dolphins thing.. it's not even a possibility and the best I can have are crickets?.. is it so? Tell me now please! Cos I have big hopes and if they grow solid and strike root, and then it appears it wasn't even a possibility.. ohh, I feel dizzy even just thinking of that.. </span></p><p>Anyways, this ship was really active and there were tons of texts! All the main threads were pretty clean, though (well, besides the Research one at the beginning of the game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico">). One day Roland wrote that we talk too much. Right after that JS appears and started to say that yep, that activity is unacceptable and it must be stopped. Or, to be exact, it must be contained in special RP thread ONLY. Funny thing, right before that I thought of creating a special thread for all the important news. Because I understand that sometimes it might be hard to go through all of these text, especially if you have not much time. But! I repeat, information about Research/Projects/Piloting was easy to find! I just wanted to create some kind of a Magazine. Like "Ian is holding the camera, there is still no decision made on that case". If JS waited just a tad, I would create that stuff. But he decided to show his attitude. He was rude and didn't want to listen our suggestion. We were ready to create completely RP-free threads (and Gioele even created it) and keep everyone informed. No, JS agreed only on total segregation. At first, that was just an arguing, but then he became a bit too insane and stubborn. He refused help anyone, but Chun and Roland (who was kind of confirmed by then). Well, you know the rest - he sent mission to Roland and we killed him. That made another bunch of confirmed humans (oh, forgot to mention, we already have some, with Ian's killing).</p><p>I was invited to mush hunting channel, created by Andie (unconfirmed). She was a bit angry, because every person, who joined the channel, asked what did she do there, hehe. I didn't write much in that channel, though. Chun did really great job, trying to read and understand all that was there. It was her 5th game and she did her best! Terry and Andie discussed different scenarios, counted AP and did a great job. So I didn't think I was really needed there. I did some side notes though, and maybe not the best ones. Firstly, I said that Derek's weapon hiding is a common thing. And I still believe he would do that no matter mush or human. I just know that he is VERY paranoid about griefers. Of course, it was our mistake, that we didn't re-hide it, but as I said, it was Chun's 5th game and she has maybe too much information to digest. I also mentioned, that I don't believe that Frieda does a TERRIBLE scans on purpose. It was good for her, to find us a decent planet. She would join the expo and we still had no alarms, so there was no point in finding only seismic mankarogs. I never mentioned she wasn't mush though, she was still damn suspicious will all that walking and her love to BD.</p><p>To sum things up, Derek and Eleesha were our main suspects from the very beginning, because no one believed in their "investigation" (come on, girls, that was ridiculous!) and everyone questioned what the hell did they actually do? There was a chance that KT or Paola (the Braindead) were mushes, or one of them + either Derek or Eleesha or Frieda. My guess is that we didn't kill Dereesha earlier partially because of that and partially because we were a bit too much involved in RPing, I admit it.</p><p>Oh, and what about my duties, besides being Satan's buddy? I had no skills, waiting to see any magebooks or some mush actions, because I had Apprentice and that makes me pretty flexible. I've never had a bed, so not much AP. All that I had I spent on research. There was another tiny mistake. We lost some time on deciding if we should research Soap or Sucker for spore removal. That's also the reason why I stayed in the Lab alone. We were coordinating on a quick push, but then things became a bit confused (with all that soap-or-sucker) and I wasn't sure if we do it now or later. I was tired of that disarray and I was going to spend some AP on sucker and go to the Dorm, right before my conversion. <span class="tid_user tid_user_8191292 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8191292">Europa</span> and <span class="tid_user tid_user_8436632 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8436632">technolass</span> are a bit wrong, when they say I SUDDENLY became active, when Frieda entered the Lab. I was active most of the time, so I was there when and before she entered... But that's another story <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"> So, <em>to be continued.</em></p>

                <p>My two cents here.. &gt;_&lt; I expect someone from the Humans to speak.. I'm not experienced enough to give long talks and my memory of intricate events is already gone. This thread would do well with a little dash of our desperate events and how the unpredictability of this game really went in our favor. I'll try to remember my best and give a brief summary of our hardships, if any mistakes please correct me.</p><p>1. I woke up, got ready and come online to see that a massive bloodshed has occurred making me nauseate on a sunday morning. Thanks to Andie's positive words I held my hopes up high saying.. What gives, Let's put all our trust on him, with only 6 human and 2 hardly active.</p><p>2. Once Andie briefed us the situation, We started to tend our wounds? and take refuge at Medlab. Raluca was brain dead, Janice/Eleesha was still under our suspicion for being a beta. We waited? for ceasefire to end and kill Stephen before he comes online.. failing to understand that they would be active and reloading their browser like crazy.</p><p>3. Gioele gets converted in the blink of an eye by Derek and Stephen and ceasefire done. We immediately? ran to Icarus bay trying to take advantage of the restriction imposed by the room that it doesn't allow more than 4 to come online. This failed drastically when only 3 of us were online.</p><p>4. We had no idea WTF was going outside and planned to wait for 12 whole cycles and go on a full scale attack. Then we noticed that the Pilgred was complete and tried to give one last shot and blindly moved to the bridge where we saw Derek and Raluca guarding FC. I assume we took 8-10 AP to kill both.. very lucky.</p><p>5. I kicked Stephen out of the Sofa and waited for Terrence to get weapons from Andie and he instead ran to Bridge where Stephen caused him a broken arm. We lost our hope here and I was there screaming at Janice/Eleesha like "EELEEESHAAA YOU ARE OUR ONLY HOPE!" and voila, she comes and kills Stephen which we never expected since she was half braindead.</p><p>Rest is history.</p>

                <p><strong>PART 2. MUSH.</strong></p><p>First thing that I have to mention is that Andie actually lives right in the next room. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br>WHAT A TWIST, right? She is my best friend and this ship was fun right from beginning, even before mush-selection. We talked in her room and she was like "No! Go away! Only two person till selection! Go!" We were pretty poker-faced all the time, no discussion outside the ship (well, beside "OH MY GLOB, soo many text, when I'd have a time for sleep" kind of discussion). But then I became confirmed human. So at least she knew about me. I was about 98% sure she is human too, because she was really into research. <br>But wait, back to the Lab and my conversion..</p><p>So, as I said, I was in the Lab (Derek was there as well) and I just finished to check mush hunting channel and was going to research and go to the Dorm. There was no Apron and I saw that Andie was the last person who picked it up. I noticed that Frieda entered the Lab and I asked Andie about the Apron at the same moment. She answered that she accidentally took it and that Frieda said she'd bring it back. I was like "ah, okay, I guess it's okay that the Witch enters Lab then. I can make some tea, it's safe!" Of course it was not. I went to the kitchen, took a cup of tea, smiled to Andie in the corridor and went back to my room. BOOM! Welcome to Mushies, darling! And here come some stir and then almost 24 hours of RACE! But let me describe that step by step.</p><p>First thing I said to my new fellow mushies, that they all are the main suspects and that we don't have much time. As you already know, they took a camera off to infect me. Mushies told me and Frieda to litter logs with fake researches + with 1 real one relay. Now I understand that it was useless (the actual relay, I mean). I'm pretty sure Andie or Terry would notice that easily. And since Andie was going to be back in Lab at C8, we had only cycle or two. I explained that to my new team and we agreed to wait a bit and then take an action.</p><p>Unfortunately, Terry became active earlier. He didn't visit the Lab, but he checked the Bridge and well, you know the rest. As I said, these guys were pretty accurate with logs, so when they reveal all the bed switches and no comms work, they decided to act asap. Sure, I said about that to my team, because I was still in the mush hunting channel and I even wrote some stuff, calling to kill KT first (he became active for a minute to drink Gioele's coffee, you already should know that as well).</p><p>After that all was SUPER quick! I already had a blaster (by the way, I'm not sure if mushies knew that before conversion) and I had to take and hide the Apron (to prevent Spore Sucker, we needed Janice's spore and it was like 80% finished!). Well, I took it, but all was so quick and stressful, that I forgot to hide it. Although I came to the AB through storages and turrets, special for that! All for nothing. Anyway, when Eleesha-to-Janice finished bombing the Dorm and we entered it, I had to drop my walkie, so I could pick up lenses. Yeah, you know the rest. Actually, I dropped Apron during ceasefire (when there was no humans, ofc), so I could read the main chat. <span class="tid_user tid_user_8436632 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8436632">technolass</span> (or <span class="tid_user tid_user_8191292 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8191292">Europa</span> ?) even said that I could go and hide it, that it's pretty safe if I would be fast enough. I said "naaaah, I've aready read everything!", FACEPALM!</p><p>You remember that Andie lives in the next room? Well, you can imagine how FUN it was for us! Imagine that. Andie knows I'm human (I am not). The door to my room is closed (usually it means I'm sleeping, but that was not too late yet). And suddenly Derek and Eleesha and Frieda are starting to move and there is some panic, Terry and Andie are trying to understand what's going on. They're yelling "STEPHEN! Derek has a blaster! Help us to kill him! He is in AB! I know you're online!" (well, obviously I am, I am in the AB as well, he he he). But the most, ultimate fun is that I actually sit in my room, barely breathing (go away, Andie, I'm sleeping, go away!), while Andie in knocking at my door like crazy! <br><img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/keepcool.png" alt=":K" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Another fun fact. While all that craziness were in progress, Raluca (who was braindead most of the time and barely said a word) woke up and told her epic line, which is the name of this thread now. She was confirmed human, and right in he middle of killings and panic and ado, she wrote "I go to sleep" in the confirmed human channel. That's it. "Roland: left this world, Hua: left this world, Raluca: I go to sleep". I don't think she ever told anything besides that. Screw you guys, I go to sleep. That's just marvelous!</p><p>Anyway, we agreed to meet in 40 minutes before ceasefire end. We had 2 hour to sleep. I barely slept for an hour. And now I need some tea again, so <em>stay tuned and to be continued again...</em></p>

                <p>Soooo... I can up this thread, I know some necromancy, my buddy Satan taught me a bit. <br>I guess I stopped on a moment, when we occupied AD and started ceasefire. What was next?</p><p>Well, first of all, we woke up about 40 minutes till the end of our first ceasefire. I came to the kitchen, to make some tea and of course I've met Andie in the corridor (you remember, we live together irl). Yep, human team don't sleep too. What was our plan? We decided to act not on the cycle change, but 15 minutes earlier. That was very wise decision, because human team was ready to act too. They were going to cut me into pieces (and they calls themselves "the Light", right?), because, I remind you, I was Stephen, who copied Diplomat.</p><p>Our main goal was to convert Terry and Gioele, but we didn't know their locations. So someone should go and check if Terry is in the BD. So, Derek went and checked it and reported immediately that yep, Terrence in the BD, Terrence infecting team - gogogo! And they went. And said that nope, Terry ran away! Meanwhile, Derek reached Medlab (Gio's location) and I should follow him. So I did. Left AD, entered AB - here was a Terry, I went right through, it was just a moment I saw him, I left AB in the moment, writing "terr ab!" in our chat and not stopping to run to Medlab. Right, infection, conversion and we up to BD for a second ceasefire. That was all done in a few seconds. So, we failed to convert Terry and gathered in the BD and I started the second ceasefire. As far as I understood, mush team were running for infection and the human team were running for mushies, because we all were online and refreshing as crazy! I literally could hear a melody from the Benny Hill show!</p><p>The second ceasefire was on, but human team still won't give up. 3 of them (Andie, Terry and Chun) gathered in the IB, trying to get some protection. Unfortunately, Raluca or Eleesha didn't come here in time, so that was really cute, but not helpful move. Meanwhile, mush team decided to leave Terry alone and take Raluca instead. Frieda transferred to her in the middle of the ceasefire and human team even didn't notice that. Until new Frieda-former Raluca came to the AD, no idea why. We killed her.</p><p>Well, you know our plan was to fix PILGRED reaaaaaally quick, right under human's noses and do a force Sol return. We succeed in fixing it, but we failed the rest. You already know why, because I had no idea I need a walkie to send a mission from the bridge. I can <em>talk</em> without it from the Bridge, why can't I just shout at everyone too? Anyone, with all these stealthy and quick moves, the second ceasefire was super intense. When things started to go wrong, we tried our best to keep be alive. I needed to survive just one cycle! Just one cycle on the Bridge, and we'd won. I had no AP left, but I got a Blaster and free points. Even when Chun came and kicked me out of bed and punched me, I still could succeed. I kept my shooter points to kick her out of bed at the end of the cycle (ofc she took my sofa). Then Andie came. And I broke my finger. Which was super unlucky. That means I had to survive for 2 cycles now. That was, unfortunately, too much. Terence visited me too, but I shoot him and he ran away. No one expected I still can do something, huh?! After all, Eleesha-former-Janice came and finished me. She also printed the List and she had to eat to kill me. If only I was a bit luckier..<br>That's practically how my story ends.</p>

That made this game extra intense.</p><p>Thanx to active human team for not giving up, you totally deserved that win. Special thanx to Chun, it was a difficult game for a new player, considering that mush team was almost all high level. Plus all that roleplay, it makes a bit harder to find who is lying, hehehe.</p><p>Also, I'd like to thank <strong>Roland</strong> and <strong>Hua</strong> too. Although you folks didn't survive for all the FUN, you tried to get through all our RPing. I believe, Hua is a very fun player too, too bad we didn't much time to see her in action.</p>
