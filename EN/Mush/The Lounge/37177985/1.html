We lasted more than anyone! Woohoo! Take that, whoever cares!</p><p>Also, everyone deserves recognition... but more than anyone, I think Jin Su does, who with some logistic skills (real logistic) knew when everyone was active, even if no one stated it. Also kept a tight schedule of everyone's time, and could pin point you on Google Earth. Did you think that mysterious van outside your house from January Sauce was casual? JS! Think again.</p><p>Also, I think we all agree that one of the most remarkable crewmember was Chao. Who is this Chao, you might ask. Well... he's a nice (hah! yeah, right) fellow who is devoted to prove that low-glory characters can and WILL get to high rankings, also he likes threatening Janice and NERON (that's more like suicide, if you ask me), loves to cook (never), and also enjoys standing idle on the Icarus Bay, with his spacesuit always ready.</p><p><span class="tid_strike">Sadly, </span>he died.</p><p>The rest will speak for themselves, or you can read my NRJ journal. Or not. But you better do. Or Ghost Terrence will haunt you. He's right now behind you!</p><p>HA! Made you look.</p><p>Crew (read this in scrolling manner as if it were movie credits):<br>- Jin Su (always awake and great leader) (as THE Commander) (lets face it, he was the most awesome Jin Su I've seen so far... yes, including me; kudos, Commander)<br>- Chun (astronav) (as The Commander's Mate <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> )<br>- Frieda (astronav) (as Astronav Officer)<br>- Finola (healer - support <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ) (as The Priest/Healer)<br>- Eleesha (healer-fixed-other) (as Comms Officer/The Fake Pumpkin Queen)<br>- Kuan Ti (astronav) (as The Awesome Dude with Striking Pose and Cool-Looking Cape)<br>- Gioele (astronav) (as The Dude)<br>- Stephen (Janice's apprentice... ah, my young Padawan) <br>- Terrence (Ghost in the Daedalus) (as The Ghost in the Daedalus)<br>- Hua (Awesome pilot) (as The Pilot)<br>- Janice (Leading star and Master Diplomat) (as The Ambassadress of Fear/The Pumpkin Queen)</p><p>Casualties:<br>- Chao (died bravely, showing us that low glory characters should get high rankings) (as Chao)<br>- Raluca (as The Fixer)<br>- Paola (as... Mush Alpha Number One)<br>- Roland (as The Prankster)<br>- Ian (as The Hippie Dude)</p><p>Mush:<br>- Paola (deathly cure)<br>- Raluca (brought to the human side)</p><p>Expeditions Log:<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/3999" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/3999</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4035" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4035</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4038" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4038</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4121" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4121</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4122" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4122</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4150" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4150</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4173" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4173</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4177" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4177</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4186" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4186</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4187" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4187</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4199" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4199</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4205" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4205</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4217" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4217</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4226" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4226</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4287" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4287</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4290" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4290</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4292" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4292</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4313" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4313</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4315" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4315</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4350" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4350</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4396" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4396</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4402" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4402</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4420" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4420</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4426" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4426</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4427" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4427</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4449" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4449</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4455" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4455</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4458" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4458</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4497" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4497</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4525" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4525</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4563" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4563</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4610" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4610</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4642" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4642</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4645" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4645</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4726" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4726</a><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4731" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4731</a></p>

                <p>Hua here, 1st place hehe, just lucky to get a shooter book and that rng spared me on all these dangerous planet. Also thanks to all these rations i litteraly ate as soon i could until like d22 or so when we started slowing down the expeditions.</p><p>Too bad you had to go Chao just when i was starting to like you, quiet and always ready to go sacrifice yourself in some high risk mission for some steaks to feed me. I really was about to kill you that day, but it would have been a mistake, after this i just stoped waiting for people to be ready and checked once every 4hours or so if expedition was done and it was fine too, was just in a hurry to find Eden at this point, we had 0 pieces.</p><p>Roland that's some bad luck you had, it could have been me or Frieda but rng chose you, on the other hand i kept ranting about MIA's maybe it was my fault (bad karma?) or maybe the RNG finaly got to us, like i said, if you keep trying you will succeed, same goes for the MIA zones insta kill, sadly <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> even if its only 3% chance each time, it adds up and if you visit 50.. you will have a taste soon or late, i even missed a few 99% shots while killing hunters, good occasion to thank you again for the targeting assist project.</p><p>Raluca, you still had a few mushrooms in your ear, but it was really unfair that you died so far, you were probably one of the most active tech on the ship and once you died, i knew we didnt had much time left and things really started to go wrong, without you getting us a diplomat and taming the Kraken <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">, things would have probably played very differently.</p><p>Jinsu, we argued a lot, mostly about planet choices and after a while i gave up and just went with what you wanted, dont think you listened to me even once, in the end it turned out quite well for me anyway, so like i said on board, nice leading, having nobody express the idea of jumping to Eden before d26 or so really shows how easily you got people to do what you wanted. Here a present <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ndvCefr.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/ndvCefr.png</a></p><p>Ghost Terrence i liked your style and hearing your whispers really made this trip pleasant.</p><p>Stephen, thanks for picking Shrink instead of Pilot, it would have been a great combo with your shooter for glory. But having 2 shrinks really made things easier for all of us. Also great healing.</p><p>Janice, nice journal and good job on board healing and pumpkining around</p><p>Ian, we had very little interactions due to our location, but nice job and sorry to see you go like this.</p><p>Gioele, nice Coffee pumping, lots of healing, scanning, fire killing and repairing</p><p>Finola, Frieda, Kuanti you've been less active in the end and (maybe?) just wanted to go to Eden, like me, but you all did a wonderful job</p><p>Chun, the captain first mate, in its shadowq but a man is nothing without his woman pulling strings in the darkness <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Eleesha, nice job on neron and after this on healing, repairing, i think you are the one who got hit the most in the end, glad that you made it alive</p>

                <p>Hello, Ghost Terrence here.</p><p>It was a great pleasure to hunt you all for so days. I can imagine it was hard to live in a metal can with the feeling that someone is always nearby… watching you… whispering to your ears… (Those were only a good things, believe me. I just wanted to make you feel good). On the other hand a wheelchair riding around on itself had to be quite a view.</p><p>Oh well… First of all I wanted to apologize for being less active on the end where the tech was so important. My work schedule was crappy, so I didn’t had enough time to check the game. On a second note it was really hard to keep up with you all… with all the messages you were writing. I needed around 20-30 minutes to just read all the things you wrote! Talk about the spam.</p><p>Now it’s time to say a few things about you people… After all we spent some time together.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> I will start from <strong>Jin Su</strong> – a very scary and dangerous dictator. I’m really glad you gave us the impression our opinion is important (as long as we were ready to change our minds to think like you). Still the most creepy thing about you was how much you knew about us. I just wonder how much time you spent to collect all the data you had. At some point I was really afraid that this van outside belonged to you (It wasn’t you… right?). Still I appreciate all the hard work you did, I guess without you we wouldn’t be able to get so far. It was my first time to reach Eden, and my first ship that last so long… Thank you for that.</p><p><strong>2. Hua</strong> – the only person who was ready to fight against the captain. In fact I was glad that there was someone who could talk with Jin Su like you did. Thanks to you we didn’t follow the dictator blindly <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I hope to meet you on another ship one day where we will be on the opposite sites. Maybe then your suspicious about me will be correct and you could actually kill me … before I will kill you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>3. Janice</strong> - First, thank you for making that thread. Second, thank you for journals. It was fun to read it. Third, thank you for all the Neron speaks you were giving to us. Some people were mad about it (I will not mention who, but he could get a lot of glory for complaining if Motion Twin would be giving glory for complaining. He could be a really high glory character that way!), but still I thought that was really funny and I loved reading those kind of conversations. So yeah, you were great diplomat and shrink… even if I think you need a shrink on your own.</p><p><strong>4. Raluca!</strong> – I’m still devastated after I discovered you betrayed me with… other men! You broke my heart! Ah… I forgot, I was a ghost. I shouldn’t have heart. No one told you that necrophilia was a bad thing? You dirty girl. I’m really glad that we were able to cure you from mushiness and I really regret that you died just before we reached Eden. Without you… the ship would fall apart much earlier. And well… we had to move on a little while after you died.</p><p><strong>5. Stephen</strong> – you were a funny guy. I trusted you more with your newly acquired shrinky skills than Janice. Not to mention you also knew how to cook. What else you need? A pet on the back, a steak in front of your face and funny jokes. I’m not surprised girls were all over you (Even I had crush on you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)</p><p><strong>6. Gioele</strong> – I don’t know what were you doing with the door to refectory. I guess Neron wanted to save you from coffee addiction. I’m glad I was able to help you with that little problem of yours. Was there something you didn’t do with all that coffee you were pouring into yourself? I guess you didn’t had blood in your veins, just coffee <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>7. Eleesha</strong> – That reporter stuff were nice things to read. Especially with so many messages, it was good to find something different from time to time. But you know… that sink you discovered… it wasn’t needed… I guess we forgave you only because of that plasma shield. <br>(Oh man… I’m already tired of writing)</p><p><strong>8 and 9. Finola and Chun</strong> deserves a lot of gratitude for working so hard on researches at first and later on healing people. We would be all dead without your help. That said a ghost. So yeah, thanks to you I gathered only a few souls to my collection. Next time I will start with you.</p><p><strong>10 and 11. Kuan Ti</strong> – I must say I would probably be more eager to go back to eden sooner if it wasn’t your comment about you not being there yet, but still willing to risk your life to live a little bit longer. At the end I’m glad we were both made it and we can both enjoy our new title <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> You did a great job with searching for planets with <strong>Frieda</strong>. It must be a hard job to satisfy the need of our dear captain. Even with a help of Gioele. I don’t remember that much… but I think Frieda was the most unlucky scanner ever <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>12, 13 and 14. Roland, Chao, Ian</strong>… Your souls were so good, so tasty… I mean, I’m really sorry you died. I wanted to apologize Ian mostly, because I think I had a chance to save you. But with Terrence it was hard to move around the ship to search for you, so I just thought someone else will actually do it. So maybe… just maybe… you could live if I would act back there, sorry for that. Chao, I hope you achieve your goal someday! (And congratulation on the project – real life is always more important than game!).<br> <br><strong>15.</strong> And of course there is <strong>Paola</strong>. I guess it had to be hard to be a mush on a ship like that with a role like you had. Mush Paola in a MMM ship… One of the worst scenarios. With Jin Su counting every single AP you were using and watching your every step you didn’t had chance to do much. I still hope you had some fun for the first few days.</p><p>Oh geez… Finished. I’m already exhausted. I could say much more things about all you, but I’m not used to write so much in English <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> You were all great, you were all did an amazing job and you all deserved much more than that.</p><p>Don’t expect me to leave you all, because we aren’t on the ship together. <br>Ghost Terrence will always be there… <br>Lurking in the dark, waiting to devour your souls. <br>Don’t be surprised when you hear a quiet wheel squeak…</p>

                <p>Jin Su checking in for a short bit here, will give a longer write-up later:</p><p>If we would've gone down to that D25/26 planet it's very likely we would've had the resources (and Hua the extra glory) to push to the #1 spot on the leaderboard and tie the D33 ship's Expo count. I should've been even more forceful in make people go down, (it was really 95% harmless, it's pretty much only Hua's stubbornness that kept her from manifesting her destiny as gloryhog extraordinaire). Although what I really should've done is had everyone divulge their cycle schedules earlier so that people could watch their neighbors backs better. Ironic that on the "All you can eat" and "low glory characters should get high ranking ship" half of all the rations that went eaten likely were sucked into the blackhole of regular hunters shot DURING CYCLES THAT WE CLEARLY HAD A PLANET TO JUMP TO W/ TRAIL MINIMIZER ANYHOW. :GRUMBLE GRUMBLE:</p><p>But it's useless to dwell on missed opportunities, I'm pretty sure this was the 2nd longest ship in season 1 so celebrate, enjoy the role you played to make it possible!</p><p>So many projects completed, thank you for your patience and discipline, I know that people probably grumbled and clamored when I stalled Fire Detector's installation, but to get 18 projects completed (and Neron participation reserved at the last) was a huge accomplishment.</p><p>Thanks for putting up with me in the first four days of the mush investigation, plans were made, investigation results were debated over and over again (ad nauseum), people I cleared with 95% certainty kept on showing up in people's independent suspicions in a collaborative hunt. SPECIAL THANKS to Eleesha who tracked people and searched the ship (aside from icarus for the lizarro <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">) meticulously with her scooter. Without that work it would've been impossible to narrow the suspect list to the VEGAS BET level of confidence I had that Raluca was the mush. Up until the moment we printed Eleesha's list we were on the cusp of killing Janice and/or Terrence! Imagine our surprise when we got a list with 4 cleared humans, Kuan Ti who we saw took starvation damage, and <strong>PAOLA</strong>. You nearly had me tricked with that "I need food to complete the rebel base!" play. You wouldn't have been able to continue the charade through our eventual plan of stuffing our comms officer to bursting for Updates, but still, good effort!</p><p>PLANET SCANNERS: little legion of lottery scratch card scratchers. Thank you all for all your work. 37 Expeditions and FAR FAR over 127 planets scanned show how much you guys were committed to bringing up the Eden pieces and letting us earn the moniker "All you can eat": Here are some notes I took (at least for our first 21 planets) on whose planet was picked, to get a better picture of who was truly the unluckiest scanner:<br>Fugucharos - Frieda<br>Epsoshopia- Frieda<br>Gruumoine- Gio<br>Komonys- Gio<br>Komodon- Frieda<br>Fugunous- Jin Su<br>Milogon - Gio<br>Pilubia- Frieda<br>Ludidon- Gioele<br>Carina- Jin Su<br>Pyrogone- Kuan Ti<br>FARIRYS X- Chun<br>Dagochadon- Frieda<br>Gouliba- someone?<br>Sigugone Frieda<br>Chun's<br>Paleoine- Kuan Ti<br>Papuma Alpha- Gioele<br>Dagopia</p><p>MANTIRIDE THETA- Frieda</p><p>TECH/REPAIRS/EMERGENCY CREW: Thanks for working so hard to keep the old ship running. Raluca, I never regret rolling the dice on sticking you with the serum before you could log on to possibly rampage, though apparently you played around behind my back.</p><p>&lt;to be continued&gt;</p>

                <p>I hold no grudge for your real life responsibilities, Chao. Just for agitating with such a bellyaching manner that we bend to your demands or else you'd start shooting cats and humans for 3 glory. If you take a look at the rankings you ended up over 400 points under the top two glory crew. That's <strong>EIGHT SHIPS</strong> (3x16 x 8 ) worth of murdered humans/mush. You had a better chance winning Warren Buffett's billion dollar bracket than getting a gold or silver supernova on my ship.</p><p>But that's all I have to say on that matter. Real life should come first, hope you feel better and congrats on the award.</p>

                <p>I'll just leave this here lol:<a href="http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/journal/v/72" target="_blank">http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/journal/v/72</a><br>I tried using that journal diary blog thingie, but apparently, I learned that I don't have any journalism talent in me. I got bored filling it with "I healed and comforted stuff this day" so I only finished it up to D22. :&gt;</p><p>As for my messages for the crew, here's a list for you arranged according to glory <span class="tid_strike">since I don't like favoritism</span> and decorated with your these icons:</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Hua, the true Glory Hoarder</strong> - I always thought that Janice would be the one hoarding glory, but I think the Shooter Mage Book changed that one. It was nice reading your debates with Jin Su to the point. I'm glad that we have a Pilot who's around most cycles to blow the aracks. &lt;3</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/sat.png" alt=":mush_eat:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Janice, the self proclaimed Pumpkin Queen</strong> - I've never seen such NERON RP on any of my ships. It was fun reading your messages even though you seem to start most fights in the ship like giving a new definition of NERON thread and fighting for your position as the Pumpkin Queen. Also, I'll miss our reciprocal hugs, my Shrink sensei.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_comp.png" alt=":mush_pa_comp:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Frieda, the Astrophysicist Lady</strong> - Good planets on our first week as well as another expo master aside from Hua! I'm kinda sad since you didn't made any action on Kuan Ti after he gave you a weird look that let's everyone know his intentions. As the love doctor Shrink, you disappointed me &lt;/3.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_eng.png" alt=":mush_eng:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Terrence, the Walking Wheelchair</strong> - Don't worry that you didn't have time for the Tech job. You had three babies that helped us even though Carwash liked killing hunters better than fixing stuff. Your spirit will always be heard on stories and our memories of you will never be forgotten. ^-^7</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/casio.png" alt=":mush_time:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Jin Su, the Commander Santa Claus</strong> - Cause he knows when you are sleeping, he knows when you're awake. He knows when you've been bad or good... yeah, I'll stop it since everyone pretty much covered our Law Student's creepy obssession of his crew. You got my point of the joke, right? Right?! :&gt;</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chun, the Stephen's True Love</strong> - After flirting with Finola, Eleesha, Raluca, Janice and Chun, our last hope's is the only one that the valiant Chef slash Shrink loved. Finola, Eleesha and Janice didn't return his feelings and Raluca cheated on him by sleeping with a fat man and a wheelchair. &lt;/3</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Kuan Ti, the Astrophysicist Guy</strong> - Do you guys know that I actually ship KT and Frieda? The young male Astrophysicist falling in love with an <span class="tid_strike">very</span> old Astrophysicist is truly a fairy tale worthy story. Too bad the whole ship forgot about it. Also, I still appreciate your planets despite them always having Seismic and Volcano.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/demoralized2.png" alt=":mush_pills:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Finola, the Researcher Chick</strong> - I still don't know how you managed to rush Antispore on Day 1 just 10 minutes after the mush were assigned. And those Day20+ heals worth of 6hp were like addictive drugs. Too bad I only got like 1-2 of those since anyone else needed them more.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/talkie.png" alt=":mush_talky:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Eleesha, the Neron Update Slave</strong> - Even though you were confined to the Bridge and got some not-so-useful projects, we still managed to get like 19 projects thanks to you. If you feel bad that Janice was calling herself the Pumpkin Queen, you can always call yourself the Rations+Mission+Sofa+Logistics Queen. :&gt;</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Gioele, the Ultimate Generalist</strong> - I can't count how many fires you've extinguished, people healed, coffees drunk and stuff done while most of us were stuck at the dorms. Also, while I'm very much out of AP, you're still there asking what to do with your AP. I felt bad when D25 came and you got separated from your coffee like every cycle. :&lt;</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_pilgred.png" alt=":mush_pa_pilgred:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Raluca, the Girl who Messed with Everyone's Love Life</strong> - First, you had a secret relationship with Paola, then you used all three beds in Alpha Dorm for your action with Terrence's wheelchair and finally, a one night stand with Jin Su. I feel betrayed by your cute and loli exterior. &lt;/3</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chao, the Hero Everyone Needs</strong> - I liked you <span class="tid_strike">in a very romantic way</span> on this ship ever since you stated your reasons why you also need Gold Days like Janice, take the Piloting lock off, join every expedition, shoot Raluca instead of cure her, shoot the cat 'in case it's mushed' and other stuff. I suggested this title in memory of you. &lt;3</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_garden.png" alt=":mush_pa_garden:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Ian, the Turret Shot Stealer</strong> - I'm sad that you use the turret with the Shell when I want to use my shooter points on it. Kidding aside, I'm still sad that you were the first victim of the falling Steel Plates and shaking rooms. Too bad I was offline by the time you reported your health. ;-;</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hunter.png" alt=":mush_hunter:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Roland, the Party Pilot</strong> - His name is Roland. And he likes the Nexus and the Icarus Bay. I still remember your message on the first day &lt;3. We could have lasted longer when we have more Hunter Killers but that MIA zone decided that a third glory hoarder should have an unlucky role on the RNG.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Paola, the Unlucky One</strong> - I don't think anyone on the ship suspected you as mush and Jin Su would have ordered to kill one of the humans that proved useful later if only Eleesha's list didn't include proven humans. I think you including Raluca on Finola's list was one of the last things that made us decide to use the cure on her, though.</p>

                <p>Hey everyone, Paola here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Hope you had a nice trip, and congratulations on getting to Eden! A shame I missed out on such an active and experienced ship, but that's the RNG for you &gt;&lt;</p><p>Being a Mush on an MMM ship is hard, but I tried my best. It's hard to be dirty as Paola though, and I knew my AP would be counted, so I didn't even get a chance to do any Mushy actions throughout my <span class="tid_strike">short</span> stay on the ship. I and Raluca knew the <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico"> would be out of the bag as soon as you started stuffing me for NERON upgrades, so our plan was to rush Pilgred, transfer into Jin Su and go to Sol just before the List would be printed.</p><p>I was quite shocked when I was killed on D4 though. I thought I remembered Eleesha saying she would print the List on D5 - was that my faulty memory, changed plans or subtle misdirection on your part, Eleesha? If it was intentional, congratulations to you - you managed to wreck the timing of me and Raluca's plan to rush Pilgred. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <span class="tid_strike">I don't think we would have succeeded anyway though</span></p><p>I have to admit, I was pretty disappointed that my food ploy didn't bear fruit. I thought that my 'I need food to finish Rebel Base, it's at 96%' while saving up 2 AP to finish it would fool most of you for sure... Anyway, sincere congratulations are due to those who saw though the ploy. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As for including Raluca on Finola's list, I realized on retrospect that it was a poor decision. If I was found on Eleesha’s List, my death would identify Raluca as a likely Mush and ensure that Raluca was cured; if Raluca was on it, then I would be immediately shown to have edited the list. <span class="tid_strike">anyway Raluca you can’t complain since ‘your side’ won in the end</span></p><p>So, congratulations to Raluca and all the humans for a game well played! Hope to see you all in another ship soon <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Re MechanisMs: Well, the flaw in that reasoning is that Eleesha's List must include one of me or Raluca. If Raluca is on it, you would eventually discover he is Mush (though elimination, since loads of people were already cleared) and I would be immediately identified as a Mush, since I lied. If I am on it, I also doom the Mush team since once I die, you would have reason to suspect Raluca, the only unproved human member on the list, must be a Mush.</p><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that I shouldn't have added the 'Raluca - No' on the list. (of course I would still have to edit it, since the original list cleared you, Jin Su <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>and Re Missile: What a coincidence, I wish so too! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Printing the Tracker list when we did was one part misdirection and one part "the timing seems right". The key here was getting the mycoscanner online and being able to demonstrate that a few of us were able to use the spore sucker to extract spores. Toss in a few crew members who had gotten a physical illness on expeditions and we had a critical mass of "known humans". We'd been such an active and careful crew, it seemed very unlikely we had someone turned+anonymush on Day 4, so I agreed to not save the list to scan for hidden mush.</p><p>The MUSH-hunting team was pretty sure Raluca was MUSH, but we weren't 100% which of 3-4 candidates our other MUSH was. Jin Su and I compared out secret stalker notes and realized we had a window of ~2 cycles where the bridge/foreward crew was relatively inactive. So we rolled the dice to see who would show up on the list. As it turned out, it showed you/Paola, with everyone else on the list being cleared as human.</p><p>So then it was a simple matter of jumping you and, in the chaos, rushing serum so we could fix Raluca. Honestly, had Ral's name been on my list instead, I'm not sure it plays out much differently. We'd been evaluating candidates for "valuable to save" skills and I think we would have rushed serum either way and then used a converted Raluca to out you. It just might've added a few cycles for you to cause some chaos on your way out the door.</p><p>For what it's worth, you should thank us - I spent the next week sitting on the bridge as Comms Officer eating every cycle I could and pressing the "update neron" button. You could've been that glutton. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Sorry you were on the wrong side of the dice on this one. For what it's worth, you certainly didn't make it easy on us.</p>
