Our crew returned from a great adventure to Sol. Thanks Kivan√ß, my love, for letting me speak in your channel. So let me introduce you all the heroes!<br><br>Our voyage ship did end just now: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6426" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6426</a><br>And what an adventure it was...it was wonderful, I really enjoyed it (of course I would have enjoyed it even more if we had more luck in that final expedition where we had chance for third starmap, but on the other side you had me on the ship and I always have bad karma, so let's skip that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">)<br><br>Big thanks for all the people I was able to ship with!<br>And now let's introduce them:</span></span></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Roland</strong>:<br>Well, now that I see that he only produced one spore, I am a bit sorry for him. He helped much with hunters in the beginning, but then there was apoint where we got new hunters and he managed to kill only very few hunters, too few to my understanding, especially when he claimed that he ate (and got dirty by eating). Hua helped me to check the loads of his patrol craft. He shot only 4 times, not often enough if he would have eaten, so I killed him. we lost a precious pilot, but luckily there was a pilot book and a shooter derek on board <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>The mush parner of Roland was <strong>Eleesha</strong>, who I won't thank for anything because she was inactive the whole time and therefore screwing up her partner.</p><p><strong>Raluca:</strong> She did very well to protect herself from being spiked though I was a bit worried about that physician/tech person whether she was mush. when we thought that we are mush-free she started to help with plasma shield, but unfortunately died shortly after Ian stayed a while in her room. Probably she also got a panic attack and didn't tell about her low morale. At that point we were worried whether we would be even able to return to sol, but with BIOS priority to projects we managed to finish plasma shield rather quickly, especially because of Frieda, who immediately realized the importance of plasma shield and left the bridge to spend all of their aps there and also motivated other people to help her.<br>Finishing of pilgred we luckily managed with an alien trade.</p><br><p><strong>Stephen:</strong> A new player who did immediately create his own newbie thread where he asked questions. Lovely! He was always polite. Unfortunately he ended up inactive at one point (when Raluca died). but that was also our opportunity to get pilgred-just in time, because one cycle after he turned grand inactive and I sold him (I had to wake up earlier in RL just to accomplish it), new hunters showed up (and the cycles before we got tons of hunters too which had to be destroyed to make that trade possible). Without that trade we wouldn't have been able to achieve as much as we did since <strong>we had no single technician after the death of Raluca.<br></strong><br><strong>Hua</strong>:<br>Oh, Hua was lovely, very cheerful and helping much around. She helped me find the mush, she always did a good piloting job and often loaded the fuel for planets. We could always count on her, she was active and she is the best example of what a good bronze player is able to accomplish! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><strong>Jin Su:</strong> One of the greatest commander I ever met, very kind and very experienced, I would like to know who that person was. ^^<br>I liked it how he lead the ship: kind, straightforward and asking for help while doing everything which was in his hand. He really earned admiration.<br>Online very often and we could rely on him always! There was no time where we had to use hacker kit to escape from hunters or go to a planet. Besides from that he helped with everything he could, be it a broken oxygen tank or loading the fuel by himself.</p><p><strong>Frieda: </strong><br>Though bronze (for the most time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">), she was very experienced and found us much great planets, especially in the beginning. Later I tried to help her as much as possible by giving her my sofa.<br>We did 11 expeditions all in all, and I think she found all planets we visited in exception of 2, so kudos to you!</p><p><strong>Janice:</strong><br>Janice did really a great job to keep our morale high, especially since we had an inactive <strong>Chun</strong>, who died quickly of starvation. Still she was able to also help taking care of plants and joining much expedition. Thx!</p><p><strong>Andie:</strong><br>Our main researcher, emergency pilot, expert in everything which has to be done, our joker.<br>And somehow still having time to flirt with Derek <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>Andie also did the final expedition (when we had already 2 starmap pieces) with compass and alone on that planet with crystalite zone. With the unfortunate and unexpected result: <em>The zone has been explored there is nothing to report.</em></p><p><strong>Derek: </strong><br>What a nice person! Excited, devoted to the commander and helpful, especially after he got pilot mage book. He could easily step in for the loss of Roland and so we had never too big problems with hunters until the end.<br>He found a person for his life with Andie I think and it was cute how they wanted to hide that relationship.</p><p><strong>Gioele:</strong><br>Well, Gioele was like we know him. A bit grumpy, well most people know my dad. Sometimes he did also vanish for a long time....and suddenly returning and doing something very incredible. Like finding that crystalite planet. If we would have found the last piece there, you would have been our secret hero!</p><p><strong>Terrence:</strong> Terrence was a new player, who also did some mistakes like giving a drone pilot upgrade without magnetic net... yep, we lost the drone and the patrol craft.<br>Well, he still did try to help us and therefore I am thankful. For example he came immediately when I cried for help with astro duty (and stayed at bridge, so not all logistics to frieda anymore, but short time after he died, probably because of starvation and room shake).<br>A bit more communication and you will be a great player, Terrence!</p><p><strong>Ian:</strong><br>Ian was very quiet, that quiet that we always forgot about him. Also when we wanted to kill the last mush, Eleesha, who was of course in lab where also the quiet Ian was.<br>Derek did hurt her badly with shooter points, but wasn't able to finish her. Well, Gio stealed Derek the kill by giving the last shot.<br>I don't know whether he helped with research, but at least as long as he was alive (maybe until day 9 or 10?), he did manage to keep all the plants in a good shape. Quietly.<br>Plz speak a bit more, dear gardener!</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti</strong>:<br>well, he was inactive half the time I would say. He was still happy with us and helped in the beginning with projects. Hm, that he played with kube and using the bed afterwards did hurt his reputation a bit <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>Ps: I noticed recently that Delzoup was on my ship...and I even forgot to shout your name when killing Roland. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico">I am sorry!</p>

It's been a while since i've played Mush, but I seamlessly rejoined the crew of the Daedalus here, and even became Gold!</p><p>There were talks of us making our own Casting -- I hope that becomes a reality.<br><br>Time for my own announcements, I guess ^^<br><br><strong>Paola</strong><br>First and foremost, wow! Great communications officer. I was the first to awake, and for a while I dreaded her inactivity. Seems that my fears were unfounded, as she came online and quickly became an integral part of the crew. If I remember correctly, I was even invited into the Mush Hunt chat with her...<br><br>Her logilistics were very reliable, and the 3AP a cycle she gave me left me very confident ^^ RNG was friendly as well, so that was a bonus too.<br><br>I also have to give her my personal thanks. Paola sacrificed more than any other crew member to get us further, and i'll feel the effects for as long as this game lasts.<br><br><strong>Jin Su</strong><br>Another great, integral member! Whenever I found a planet, he was quick on the ball to get us moving! I don't know who handled the fuel, but they were fast, and effective! We couldn't have gotten so close without them both.<br><br><strong>The Research Team</strong><br>Nice, fast, and effective! We got the lenses quickly, though I was a bit frightened at how slowly we were seeming to get the cure.<br><br><strong>To the pilots, including Roland</strong><br>You were all amazing! The Hunters barely got a hit on us for a majority of the game. It's only when Roland fell, that they started to get through. When we got the shield up, we were around 2 cycles from death... Which is amazing. Close escape.<br><br><strong>To everyone</strong><br>This ship was amazing, and everyone contributed in some way. We couldn't have done it without you.<br><br><br>EDIT: I have 13 casting tickets. Should I try to get it started? What shall be the name?</p>

Hello again from your <strong>captain</strong>! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/jinsu.png" alt=":mush_jin_su_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This was a pretty good ship! Mush went down quickly and the key roles were manned by reasonably active people. I got a bit disheartened after Raluca's death (which was accompanied by a shipwide glum silence), but the PILGRED trade and some good starmap luck picked things back up again. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Unfortunately, the ship started falling apart faster than we were able to sift through candidates for the final starmap planet. I was really hoping Andie's solo run would pay off, but we weren't <em>that</em> lucky.</p><p><strong>The Bridge Ladies</strong><br>Thanks to <strong>Paola</strong> and <strong>Frieda</strong> for their dedication! Paola did a great job on comms, started the mush hunt thread after Roland was killed (our Chun went inactive in the refectory) and rolled Fire Detector on her very first NERON upgrade. I'm sure we would have fizzled a lot sooner if not for that. Frieda was able to keep the scans coming, and got us some nice planets... even if some of them did their level best to kill me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I also liked Paola's regular status reports, including <em>quite the scoop</em> on our security officer and head researcher...</p><p><strong>The Pilots</strong><br>We were lucky enough to have four pilots on this ship, thanks to the starting mage book! Well... technically. Effectively we had three, two of them (<strong>Hua</strong> and <strong>Derek</strong>) completely dedicated to hunter-splatting. I only got the change to fly out once, when we were clearing hunters to allow for Stephen to be traded. <strong>Andie's</strong> <em>Devotion</em> got him/her into the fray quite often as well, though they still poked research gamely as the ship stretched on. The only one of my missions they didn't receive was D4's, I think... which I gave to Hua while she was working as a solo pilot after Roland's demise. You were absolutely great by the way, Hua: bright, cheerful, and always ready to do your duty.</p><p><strong>The Shrink</strong><br>Thanks <strong>Janice</strong> for taking care of us! You were especially in demand that final day, and though you were stretched thin you did all you could. A solid expo team member as well - having both you and Andie meant that we were a lot more versatile in when we could head planetside.</p><p><strong>The Quiet Do-ers</strong><br><strong>Ian</strong>, <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> and <strong>Terrence</strong> were kind of a mysterious force. KT and Terrence especially had a tendency to go inactive, then wake up and scuttle around the ship doing things, some of it useful. KT did it loudly (I think he was newish), and Terrence remained silent. A pity we didn't get Magnetic Net and lost his pilot drone, but the effort was appreciated. Ian silently tended his plants and then died of depression with hardly a peep. Poor fella. <strong>Gioele</strong> sort of fit in here for me, as well - he was very helpful moving cameras to IB for the early expos, but had computer trouble and faded in and out of inactivity for a while. However, I'm sure he was doing his best, and he did find us that last Cristalite planet!</p><p><strong>Stephen</strong><br>Ah, our fresh-faced newbie. Poor fellow, he wanted so much to be Doing Things to help the crew, and he picked a character that is not often entitled to a bed. He hung on gamely for a while and asked a lot of questions, but finally went inactive. I'm sorry we lost your attention, and if I wasn't doing enough to keep you focused on the mission. On the positive side, we were able to return home instead of being forced to 1% PILGRED all the way from... gosh, I never looked, it was probably only 20% or so when Raluca died. The aliens seemed to think you were quite a specimen.</p><p><strong>The Mush</strong><br>You were fun while you lasted, <strong>Roland</strong>. Pity you got caught out so easily, and that hidden on the bridge was a decisive mush hunter. I was definitely side-eyeing you after you only killed two hunters with food and the lenses. Heck, I've missed before with both lenses and the sniper helmet, but with food in the equation you've gotta take out more than two! But I was surprised to log in and find someone had actually done something about it so quickly.</p><p>Meanwhile, I had already noticed that <strong>Eleesha</strong>, who had been skill-less in the lab before mush selection, had chosen Determined by the time I checked and found the game had started. The fact that she had done that and yet stayed inactive seemed like the skill was possibly being auto-chosen. I tried not to take that too much into account on its own, but after Roland died there was little fishy activity going on aside from the sorts of mistakes that humans also make. And she just stood uselessly in the lab. So we made a couple attempts to check for starvation damage, then had her killed. Slowly. My mistake was sending Derek to do the deed when Ian was in the lab. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> He was so quiet I forgot that he was there! I think Derek also didn't quite realize what effect Ian was having on his attacks. Regardless, my security officer hit all three blaster shots (Shooter ftw) and connected all three punches that he was able to attempt, which made cleanup duty easy - one shot from Gioele and our other mush was down.</p><p>For a while we wondered if maybe Eleesha had been a sacrificial beta (especially if Gioele could have done any spiking before putting the camera up in the lab) but ultimately the timing was wrong for that to be possible. She was just an inactive alpha who screwed over her partner.</p><p><strong>Andie</strong><br>Want to make a special shoutout to Andie, for being so dedicated, both ingame and in character. You put my mission AP to good use and helped keep the expos coming. And thanks for <a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/vII0BoO">keeping that Skinner from killing me</a>, eh? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Derek</strong><br>And thanks to you for also being eager to help and always ready to go. I also think your evasiveness over your relationship with Andie was the most adorable thing. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"> I even screenshotted <a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/16dtdWi">this exchange</a> (minor editing) because I thought it was so freakin' cute.</p><p><strong>The End</strong><br>I pretty much summed it up in my end words and false-start-AP thread, but ultimately: we could possibly have made it to D15. Maybe. With a ton of luck. But when I woke up to go to work and saw that 8 hunters had turned into <strong>36</strong>... I panicked. I was on 5 health, and it looked like the crew had already done their healing rounds. What if I got plated the next cycle, or worse? Would Gioele be around to jump in my stead in time? (He had left final words by the time I got a break to check, so the answer could well have been "yes." ) The pilots were drained, so jumping to lose hunters was probably not an option. It would only take a couple cycles for them to mow through our plasma shield if were unlucky, cycles I would be at work, unable to coordinate for more than 15 minutes each. So I decided to make the safe move, the one that ensured everyone would make it safely to Sol. I felt a bit bad about it, but I still think it was the right decision.</p><p>And hey, I certainly wouldn't mind seeing some of you in future ships. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>What a funny text, Kobb. I liked especially calling Ian, Terrence and Kuan Ti the silent force <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.<br>I didn't notice that eleesha's skill were autopicked after selection. Well I also was last person to join, but also didn't hear that or overheard it while we were on the ship. <br>But most importantly I am very excited about your great art of the expedition where Andie took damage of that skinner! wow, you are incredibly gifted!</p><p>regarding casting I also have to say that a new casting is probably no good idea (though I know probably enough people to start one). Well, I am already in a casting, it is a <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/group/6">big one</a>, where you would be welcome too (like in Kobbs casting). TE has the advantage that there are definitely enough people to be able to start ships and I also have already some friends of me there. It has maybe the disadvantage (for some people it might also be an advantage) that with that much people it is still not very probable to meet certain people you already know on the casting ship. There are lots of people in TE I have never met on any ship yet.<br>But joining the pioneer casting would probably help them that they are actually able to start their first ship, so...<br>if anyone is interested you coudl join one of these castings, I wouldn' t like to have a discussion which casting is better... they both have advantages and disadvantages ^^</p>
