And to Frieda, the great mush companion that lead to the destruction of Daedalus.</p><p>Overall of the session:<br>Alpha mush: Chao (me) and Paola. I only had Phagocyte and Paola had a lot of skills up, including Anonymush. We coordinated pretty well despite the research team completing research after research giving us a hard time (mycoalarm, constipaspore, etc). Camera was on bridge, Alpha dorm, and engine room (CMIIW). Good thing Bravo dorm had no camera so when Eleesha was sleeping and inactive several cycles in Bravo dorm, we had no choice but set Eleesha as target #1. Somehow Paola managed to reserve AP and infected Eleesha (pretending to be dirty from eating, if not mistaken), and also trapped the refectory shelf.</p><p>Jin Su was pretty talkative, and initially one of our targets, but we thought he's too risky. He managed an expo up pretty early. But somehow after several cycles, he suspected Stephan as an inactive mush and made the kill, well done Jin Su. After several cycles, Jin Su eventually died of low morale.</p><p>Then that made me Commander. *muahahahah*</p><p>By this time, researches were mostly completed so it was extra hard. I stayed mostly in the Bridge with Paola (you made me get an extra 1 AP every cycle), and also.. Eleesha. We wanted to infect Eleesha so bad but out of AP and there's a camera. I forgot the reason for Paola getting back to Alpha dorm, but later she informed me that she had spiked Frieda once, and coordinated the timings so once she spikes, I spike the next minute and we have a turned Frieda. The plan worked. Good thing Frieda had Anonymush, so crew bar stil show 1 mush (which was me).</p><p>Later, in the bridge, Eleesha caught Paola sabotaging the camera (what were you thinking, Paola?). Then there goes the first mush hunt. I had to buy some time because we still wanted to turn Eleesha, and also: tried to send and expo team and ditch them while they're gone; 4 human kills at once. Good thing was, I was trusted, so Eleesha invited me to a private human channel. She explain about the sabotage and wanted Paola dead. I told them, I'm on it; well you know it's obvious that actually I'm not <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">. Instead, I told the crew we need to get an expo going before loosing o2 as a distraction. And so Frieda gave info of a planet, and Eleesha did the same. I took Eleesha's info, Frieda helped with the fuel. I wonder why Kuan, Roland, Ian and Hua that were all in Bravo dorm didn't even wanted to help. But that's cool, that made it better reasons for you guys to go expo.</p><p>Now here's the turnaround. Frieda had the right fuel (I actually checked, going back and forth from bridge to engine), and I had the directions correct. But after the move, we were no where. Hua freaked out claiming Eleesha is mush. Great. Now, things are pretty frustrating for the humans, I'm sure. I forgot which was killed first, but eventually Roland was down to hunt Paola (I still had the private channel to at least inform Paola), and Eleesha was killed (by Hua and Raluca, I think.. thanks Hua and Raluca!).</p><p>When Paola was killed, and crew bar still shows 1 mush, that concludes they had killed the anonymush. Frieda was so helpful post Paola killed, and we planned for a second expo (we still need to kill 4 humans to make it easier for us). So we try to buy time as much as we can and finally informed about a 16 zone planet while actually 3. It didn't matter because we just wanted 4 humans out. Frieda and I coordinated nicely, turned Gioele and we finally move Daedalus to the planet. It seems that the humans have already given up. Only Hua was still up for expo, the others were silent. Raluca was griefing and asking to die. Terrence was assassinated (by Finola?), she probably thought Terrence was mush.</p><p>When we arrived, my oh my.. it was the PERFECT STORM. 16 Hunters (including several asteroids), fires, diminishing O2, and I'm sure the human players are all gone bitter by now. I took the pleasure to try to kill Chun just for fun. Frieda stopped me on mush channel that I should start killing once AP is maxed. Chun started shouting in public that I'm mush. Hua was the only human reacting on that moment, giving a despair "I don't want to live on this planet anymore" comment. Hahah.. Luckily being the charming Chao, I told Chun that she was supposed to be in the labs (she was in medlab), and that was the reason of my assault. She was a little confused, but eventually after several excuses, she bought it. Now when I think of it, it doesn't matter anyway to that point because the other humans had basically gave up so if I hadn't talk my way to Chun, nobody probably wouldn't care.</p><p>Lastly, humans died one by one from low morale, and the finale ending was the magnificent fireworks of Daedalus.</p>
