Not a great game, though I had fun wondering if I could keep it going long enough and the bad parts were certainly not the fault of the active players.</p><p>My co-mush Stephen died early. Not his fault, it was just his first time and he made some bad, transparent moves early on. He choose a weak bronze skill (fungal kitchen) and double-spiked a ration which was ultimately eaten by Chun. I got one early spike in on Paola, but that was it. Every other spore I made ultimately went to Phagocyte.</p><p>I thought I was done for early on after making a bunch of mistakes and unlucky moves which made me look very mushy. A broken gravity generator messed up my Ap count and I ran out before I could plant the camera I was carrying. When i woke I walked to nexus to check the BIOS settings forgetting I can't read the settings (pulling some spores on the way). I showered quick then installed the camera which of course got me dirty again! I also lied about scanning a planet I did not and was lucky no one noticed that. Lots of talk that I was a mush but it all went away, I think just because there were so few active players no one really wanted to kill someone active. Taking my suggestion of adding me to the mush-hunting private channel was not a great idea, but then I'm not sure I was on the real hunting thread anyway.</p><p>Only one griefer and two inactives so it could have been a good game but but there were several playing but not really interacting (really people, why do you play a social game), Jin Su died on expo making me commander also and it was all over. There were not enough active pilots to keep the hull from becoming cheesecloth without a pilot who really wanted it not to. There were only 6 or 7 really active, plotting, and talking players so just wait for four of them to go on expo, abandon them on-planet, mutate, kill some inactives about to die anyway, and let the morale hit kill everyone but three.</p><p>Hua and Finola did their best to punch me to death but even with the ship pitching in and dropping a ceiling on me last cycle, I still had one heart when the ship blew up.</p><p>As far as playing with their limits though the crew did pretty good. I'm sorry to hit the sisterhood like that and would have loved to see how far we could have made it go, but that was not the game given to me. I did try to hold on long enough for you to meat the mankarog but ultimately got too worried the expo would end on me and had to make my move. I hope I'm on your side next time!</p>

                <p>Paola here. Yes, you were invited in the real mush hunting channel, but at the point you were invited so much bad had happened that we basicly didn't even have a real chance at Sol anymore, so we didn't really care about the mush anymore, we had waaay bigger worries. And it turns out you kept our ship alive rather than killing it so it wasn't a huge mistake to invite you.</p><p>I'm a little sad you left us on the expo. It's a good mush tactic normally sure, but we were so doomed already it almost seemed rude to act against us there while you kept us alive earlier when we were ready to die. We launched the expo with 3 not 4 like you reported, janice died from a MIA event and we were only 2 left on an expo where we still had to face mankarogs and two caverns and such deadly things. So why kill us and not let us have our last bit of fun first which would most likely also have killed us. If you didn't do anything and we managed to survive the expo we would have been killed by hunters next cycle anyway.</p><p>I also saw Roland was abandonned? how did that happen we had magnetic net and he wasn't with us on the expo. Did he launch to the planet in a patrol ship or something?? Weird sweet Roland! Yes Chun I saw you flirted back with Roland just before we went on our expo! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As for the early game, where you spored me. I first reported Stephen's behavior, but him being an obvious newbie bought him some time and it wasn't till his third spore that we were sure. Your first spore I also reported and I took a lot more serious, you clearly weren't a newbie so leaving the room just to return again so fast especially taking the camera hostage was very very suspicious. But your excuse was so mind blowingly good. And I still believe it was an honest human mistake that with luck turned out to be the perfect mush excuse. I mean if you really went to check the bios knowing full well you couldn't see the settings, but still did so with the intention of using it as an excuse for extracting a spore then that's the best excuse I've ever heard a mush come up with. Extracting a spore is stressing work and to have such a specific and unique lie then would be very impressive. So yes, that saved your hide early on.</p><p>The mistake of Hua combined with the brutal electical spike in the lab is so far the worst I've seen happen to a ship from RNG and human mistakes in such a short time. It also happened during a time I couldn't be online much for 24 hrs, so I left with a very enjoyable group of people in the mush hunting channel having lots and lots of fun and I came back to a ship that was doomed. That felt like a real punch in the gut.</p><p>But a huge thank you to Chun and Janice for making this disaster ship so enjoyable for me! Also Jin Su, thanks for playing along with our weirdness for the short time you were allowed to be with us <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>And well played Frieda. Frieda mush with a newbie partner isn't easy at all.</p>

                <p>Chun here.</p><p>Congratulations veggie sister Frieda. It was a terrible ship, but a fun one and thanks to you we made it last this long.</p><p>The "I forgot that I have the camera" thing was the point in the game where I saw my knife in your body already, but then Stephen got the priority (after the weird Chao griefer) and all of a sudden I didn't want to kill anyone anymore. Competence and activity &gt; suspicion as you said in your post. <br>The question if it was really worth it was a heavy load on my mind and then the girls said that your BIOS journey was in fact true...totally stupid but true..so you lived. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Stephen should have coordinated his answers with yours because I REALLY wanted to believe him. He was a newbie and it was so easy to pressure him with some simple words like "I get a hell lot of calls for your weird behaviour" ..yeah well..hell of a lot equals exactly 2 <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>He would have lived if he would have stopped sporing and then taking a sneaky shower..like you. <br>You went the sneaky road and after that there was no real possibility to proof anything.</p><p>Eleesha was braindead, Chao a griefer and we had so much roles to fill...no time for running around and playing detective.</p><p>I often said to myself that I should just stop and be the "normal" Chun. The one sleeping or standing around. That I wasn't braindead is actually more than you can tell of the Chuns I know and noone had to care for me either. I even fixed the gfravity because our males were useless besides Kuan Ti who kept Neron, Pilgrid AND Research going. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But doing all these silly things like going onto expos which Chun shouldn't do at all cost being the last hope and such, forming the girls club and trying to move the ship by throwing myself against the hull. If I would have been any other character (I think) I would have been dead by day2 for my silly stuff, but Chun has her privileges I guess. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I even had a place for our foreign "I don't understand anything and ask weird questions, but reply in mystic ways" Roland in my heart. He really was our mascot and I beamed whenever I went to engines and saw that Raluca kicked him again...and again and again.</p><p>Leaving us was totally fine. It would have ended anyway and now I'm Chun once more..on a terrible ship..once more <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">..with a big neon <strong><em>DOOMED</em></strong> sign above my head. I already know it can't be as much fun as the last one.</p><p>Thanks for everything and I hope Janice has fun with her snowmen. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Chun, looks like we were punished with the same stinking ship for a follow-up. I think this one will last even less than the last. It has doomed written all over it.</p><p>I was not really playing stealth. I only managed to place one spore but I pulled more. Once Constaspore was in place and I was stuck as commander it became very, very hard to pull more than one a day. Sporing the brain-dead was pointless and though I almost always had a spore on me, I kept needing to Phagocyte to protect myself before I could spore someone useful. The humans for the most part did play very careful.<br> <br>Stephen I think would have been a great mush had I come online first and talked him into this start. As it is he came on first and pulled his spores not knowing how to place a cover story. As for me, I really did forget I can't read the BIOS.</p>
