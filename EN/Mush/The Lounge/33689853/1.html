We were pretty heavily a newbie ship, except for Terrance and Gioele. Still, only a handful of our group was terribly inactive. (Raluca and Finola really). I had a great time working to get our poor, mush-defenseless crew through a wildly successful expedition. I had an even more hilarious time helping Gioele coordinate two very rapid conversions and a murder spree that ended the ship in just under a day. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Comments For Individuals<br>Jin - No hard feelings! You did a fantastic job as our commander up until you were brutally betrayed by your three most active players. Would happily play with you again! Perhaps with less "Leaving me behind" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Paola - It was a true pleasure to go through the newbie experience together with you. Our chats were fun! I'm glad I convinced Gioele to convert you with me, and I'm glad you were last mush standing!</p><p>Gioele - You were a pretty awesome guy for an Alpha Mush. You set the stage perfectly with your trapping. We would probably make a pretty fantastic team had we been on the same side from the start.</p><p>Eleesha/Janice - You two were hilarious to watch fighting. I'm sorry for the drive-by, but I couldn't resist hitting someone I knew was a weak target.</p><p>Terrance - I hope you enjoy your new Ipad!</p><p>Chun - What happened to you in the end? I was looking forward to seeing your reaction to half the crew going Mush.</p><p>Chao - You need to be more suspicious! Watch for that dirty! Dirty is the enemy!</p><p>Stephan - Your energy, both from your character AND from your messages always made me smile!</p><p>Hua - I still don't know why you went on that expedition alone! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Lai Kuan Ti - Your reaction to getting rambo-spiked was priceless and hilarious. 10/10 would spike again!</p><p>Stephan - In the end you were probably the wisest of all the humans. Sadly, Gioele was armed and quite ready to blow you away by the time you worked it out.</p>
