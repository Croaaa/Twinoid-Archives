(sorry Roland and Janice)</p><p>It started when Roland picked up Blaster, killed inactive humans, and picked up Mycoalarm. That's how he was considered as a mush, so Ian, Terrence and I decided to get him. It was a big mistake because a cycle after Roland dided, a big group of hunters approached. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The ship was far from active. Raluca and I were jumping the ship away using the hacker kit. In the very end, we were at 10 armor and almost no ap to do much. So Raluca, Eleesha and I decided kill a suspect, Janice, even though there's no concrete evidence. Again, it was another mistake. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In the end it turned out that Paola and Finola are alpha mush. I totally had no clues about Paola. Good game though.</p>

He did nothing but paint a big red target on his back when he killed the inactives.

I had spare AP and I needed to burn them off, and Pilgred was the closest way to burn them. It would have been better if you sat in a turret instead of <strong>sitting at one of the entry points of the Engine room.</strong> I saw that the armour was low, so I decided we should have rushed Pilgred and jump back to Sol.</p>

                <p>I wasn't on your ship, but just wanted to comment, irrespective of glory it's considered a 'mush win' if a mush is alive when the ship returns to sol or goes on to eden. (getting to eden would be the really big win). Technically, a human wanting to go to sol with mush aboard is a human that's playing to lose or surrendering in a way that takes the whole ship down (but it's totally understandable if you didn't know that was a loss!). Some players view it as a human loss unless you return to Sol or get to Eden not just mush free, but also with the cure.</p>

                <p>I was Ian. I advocated Finola being suspect since I was pushing the research almost entirely, but I didn't think the evidence was strong enough to really go after her...plus we had other concerns with Roland being for all intents and purposes a griefer. Roland spent all his AP the entire ship killing humans so he had to die, human or not. But of course we then had the hilarity of like 15 ships popping up on day 3 with no active pilots, then 20 at the end .</p><p>Anyway, returning to Sol with mush onboard is much worse than getting blown up, because you're dooming Earth. For the sake of humanity, we had to kill you lest you find the hacker kit and doom the human race for a few more weeks of life.</p>
