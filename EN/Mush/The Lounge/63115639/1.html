                <p>I started out as Raluca, the 14th person to awaken and it was already D5C1. I had jumped immediately after suffocating on a previous ship, (within seconds) but this ship's timer was a few minutes slow and cycle change was about to happen.</p><p>In the two minutes to cycle change, I saw that Pilgred had been completed - a trade most probably, and no mention of a death but there were a couple of deceased crewmembers. The hull was extremely low as well.</p><p>I wait in lab for the cycle change, and was not selected as alpha mush. The hacker kit was on the bridge as it had been attempted to leave the deadly planet behind. However, I thought I should move the HK away from bridge, hiding it on my way to find mush sample.</p><p>Sample was in AB2 but so was a lot of metal, and I used my tech skills to help mend the hull. I take refuge in a turret and Janice whisks the sample to the lab.</p><p>After cleaning myself up, I stay in the lab under camera and do research. It progresses slowly, yet the hunters after Jin Su moves the ship, destroy part of the hull.</p><p>Who is mush? Who has Jin Su been giving missions to?</p><p>There was oxygen on the bridge so I put some in the tanks. I run out of ap/mp so rest in IB.</p><p>D6, I wake up to find Jin Su is dead. Stephen is the next commander. He has taken apprentice - Pilot. I had noticed Stephen and Janice had visited me in IB. Back in the lab, I noticed that Janice was not an alpha mush so that put me much at ease.</p><p>I go and patch up the hull again and am dirty. I rest up in RAT.</p><p>I go and play Die2Nite and watch youtube videos, but checked back D7C1. It was announced that there was a third mush - yes. Janice contacts me and a few others as she guessed who the beta was, and who was likely to have converted. I was at low ap/mp so couldn't do much about it. The beta was Paola, and the alpha was Ian. Very little doubt about that. Ian had also visited me in my turret I think after the beta was noticed. I mentioned this in a separate channel with Janice. I mention to her that I could Genius RFS, but who would we cure. As it turns out, Ghost Chun wasn't decoded (and Chun never woke up).</p><p>Ian is slain by Stephen. Frieda is also dirty on the bridge (no camera there), and Stephen slays her too.</p><p>Who is the other alpha? We have ideas, Kuan Ti being one of them. However, he visits me in RAT and turns me into Mush. Although I was online at the time, Kuan Ti takes anonymush and we discuss options in the Mush Channel. This cycle, I'm not usually online but the youtube livestream is distracting me.</p><p>Janice kills Kuan Ti. Janice still trusted me, and suggested I take the knife (timing for dropping wasn't arranged), but she also suggested I take a bed in AD. I do so and sleep. Janice hugs me</p><p>While I slept, I missed some of the fun. I guess because research was slow, Stephen killed Andie after he'd completed CS. Paola the first beta, transferred into Janice after removing AD camera and declared a ceasefire. This new Janice has forgotten how to shrink. I feign offline as not yet at full ap/mp.</p><p>D7C7 I come back online to discover there was no o2 in the tanks (there had been 4 two cycles ago, but one tank was broken for only one cycle). Someone had oxygen. Stephen had flown off into space in an AB patroller and there were no hunters. Terrence had suffocated. There is oxygen on the bridge and I put some in the tanks, fixing the broken one. I pick up the hacker kit and the blaster Stephen had dropped in CAS, taking them to the bridge. I drop both. I want to appear human.</p><p>The new Paola contacts me. I voice my suspicions about Stephen. Stephen looked mushy to me. Paola has loaded the fuel. First, though, she trades the hydropot for yet more oxygen. She plans to kill new Janice.</p><p>As I was in the mush hunt channel, I was of course relaying information to my mush partner. New Janice hacks and abandons Stephen - he's human, of course.</p><p>D7C8 comes and we arrive a sector away. There are arack. Ceasefire has ceased. Paola attacks Janice, damaging her ears! However, she just has enough ap to launch into space after taking pilot lock off. There is no camera in BD either, and so I take mycelium spirit and fertile, and infect the sleeping Roland. I half-looked for Janice but went into the Nexus (unprotected). Hua comes in, and perhaps didn't read all the latest information, and kills new Paola. Hua then provided me with a mission to kill Roland (or be killed). At this stage, we were down to 2 human, 2 mush. I head to BD, camera had been installed through Paola's death. No matter. I take a bed. I have my other skills selected. Minute to go.</p><p>D8C1. I noticed Roland flashed, but no roomshake or plate. I took the chance that he was starving. I took my fertile spore, and a second spore, and infect Hua twice. Forgot I had a mission, and transferred into Roland. Extracted for free again and finished Hua's journey to mush off.</p><p>I think that just about wraps it up!</p>

Thanks for writing up the summary.</p><p>Just a few things that were rather fun for me:</p><p>I was Paola (beta mush) who transferred into Janice and called ceasefire. After the transfer, I gave up some hints to Stephen that "we" were sad that we weren't invited to their private channel, which had pretty much everyone except Paola (now Janice) and <strong><em>Andie</em></strong> (100% human)...and Stephen proceeded to kill Andie without hesitation, much to my delight. IIRC Stephen had a suspicion it was either Paola or Andie that were mush, and that subtle push seemed to have ended the deal.</p><p>I then tried to remove suspicion from Raluca by teasing the humans and telling them Raluca is going to die from morale since I didn't take shrink. I think it worked, and with Raluca also deceiving the humans with her cunning (so evil!) she was a <strong>super spy</strong> for the entire time since she became a beta, and she was not a confirmed suspect even until the very end!</p><p>Then Hua kills Paola (human) then gives a mission to Raluca to finish the job and kill Roland (human). Not her fault as she is quite new, but it was rather enjoyable to witness.</p><p>Lots of fun, hope to run into you all in future ships!</p>

                <p>I was Stephen. I knew Paola had been converted but was certain Andie was Mush as well. Never thought about Ralu being Mush until it was too late. I'd hoped RNG would be on my side and suffocate a Mush when I took off with the remaining oxygen. Guess even RNG was on the side of the Mush. Oh well, well played by the Mush.</p>
