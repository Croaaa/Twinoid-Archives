Raluca joins game, is never heard from again. I, Eleesha, volunteer to come install the camera in the lab, before I put it on the wall I spike Kuan Ti twice. He's a high level and my main target. Meanwhile Janice is running around cooking all the rations and is quickly put down by Derek.</p><p><strong>Day 2:</strong> Grab my spores and hope for a chance to catch KT away from a camera. Try to set up a Nexus relay date but that is delayed. Commander Gio, replacing an inactive JS, has loaded fuel and taken us to a planet then decided to wait in CC. Andie checks and 0/12 zones have been scanned. I decided to convert Gio as he will be killed and allow me to hide. I spore Gio twice in CC during a pretend sweep of the ship.</p><p><strong>Day 3:</strong> Spore again. Hey look the camera magically went out in Bravo Dorm, bam KT, welcome to Mush. I take anon and wait for KT to come on board. When he does we notice that Gio has gone into IB for his expo. I tell KT to prepare to take anonymush himself and walk in there to "check who is in there" and give him his final spike. 2 mush in one day. 4 total. 3 active.</p><p><strong>Day 4:</strong> wake to see the crew killed Gio. Oh well. Then the crew FINALLY notices that Raluca has been in the lab this entire time. They decide to kill her. Feeling safe Terrence asks KT for a push. KT spores him. Raluca is killed, and I set up a nexus relay with Terrence to finish him off when I know he's active and can take anonymush. We go in to relay magnetic net, come out two Mush who did no advancements at all. Really humans, you need to start paying attention.</p><p>Meanwhile we're running low on o2. Terrence and I snag the final o2 capsules and unfortunately KT dies first. Chun notices that suddenly a new mush is dead! But T had turned off death notifications. They can't figure out who is dying or why. Inactives are starving, Paola is killing herself, people are suffocating. It is glorious.</p><p>The ship wasn't very good but it was all the actives at the end. Chun, Derek, Andie, Paola, and Finola and not a single one of them noticed that the o2 went from 3 to 0. The evidence was there in the CBS that Terrence and I went in.</p><p>Day 5 Cycle 1: Terrence and I are in BD. I notice a lone figure on the bridge, spore twice and head up there to spike Derek twice. Terrence shows up in time and goes and finishes him off. Then Terrence and I celebrate our last few minutes before Neron kills us by turning out the bravo dorm's lights. When they came back on, Terrence had mutated in celebration. Then we were killed.</p><p>If we'd only managed to get to that o2 planet, KT, Terrence and I would have been able to snag everyone on board except Chun. It would have been even more marvelous than it already was. Not the best ship of all time but having 3 undetected Mush is great fun (sorry Derek you don't count, you were just a last minute accomplishment).</p><p>All in all, one of the best experiences I've had being stuck with an inactive Alpha partner.</p>

                <p>Nice to see you, Eleesha. <br>I must say you did a great job. You fooled most of the people and even I was a little bit suspect you turned me before I was able to do anything. I really didn't thought I had two spores on me from the beginning... but there was a little bit of luck - really, camera breaking up in a dorm at few first day? I was never converted in a dorm before. I went to sleep with a thought I'm totally safe! <br>I warned Gioele to not do anything silly or risky, but to tell the truth I was a little bit tempted to point at him. I noticed he took 10 fuel before Derek noticed it - at the end I didn't had to say anything, they decided to kill him anyway. <br>Pointing at Raluca was also our idea, no one really paid attention on the aspect that she was in the same room as Hua from the beginning of the game - she had to be dead long time ago. <br>Taking Terrence on our side was a good idea as well - after all he suspected us. He couldn't act when on our side. <br>I really loved our future plan. Taking control of everyone else - they already thought they are safe after you told them you can't print the list. <br>I only regret I was the one who died from lack of the oxygen first. I was afraid someone will notice that and they will kill you on sight, Eleesha. After all it would be obvious you lied about the list. I was glad to notice you were able to convert Derek at the end. <br>Even if it was a little weird ship... I want to thank Chun, Andie, Derek and Paola for being active and trying. I was on your side at first... <br>Also I would want to know what was Stephen thinking... He didn't say too much, but because of that note he left I think he must be a funny guy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Andie unknowingly covered for me. I was sure I was dead. But Derek said "It must be Eleesha because of the list" and Andie said "The list only shows the alpha mush, she couldn't print it even with beta" which I don't think is true.</p><p>I wish you'd been around to take an o2 canister with us, KT! I was so upset you died first. Then Chun said "WAAAAA another mush is dead?" but she took a bed in BD with Terrence and myself and never actually investigated. I thought we were done cause Chun had been the only one on top of investigation before that.</p><p>As to the note KT referenced above, Stephen became our commander and left a post it that said whoever found it would get the mission.</p>
