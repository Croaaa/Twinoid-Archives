                <p>This ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7412" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7412</a></p><p>I was Eleesha became Jin by transfer to end it.</p><p>The main way you could have stopped us was much earlier than the pilgred rush, of course. Janice and I were alphas. Raluca's insistence to be alone was used against her; if the alphas can enter her room without being checked on, they can potentially convert her before she can scream for help. (which we did, coordinating a random moment of the cycle change clock to pop her into mushiness)</p><p>She didn't quickly leave that storeroom, in part to help hide the log of her being visited. Hua broke her request, later apologizing cause she hadn't read it yet.... Hua also didn't read roomlogs to see that Raluca had already been visited twice by people who didn't have any reason at all.</p><p>You could have caught the roomlogs in RC, both Janice and I legitimately worked on projects that cycle we converted Raluca. But suspiciously we were both in the room at the same time, and if you counted the number of times we entered and left RC, it should have been two pairs - once for leaving then entering the dorms, once for entering then leaving the nexus. We both had 3 pairs - you can't tell where we went but we should have ONLY gone to nexus.... so a wander away to spike Raluca one room away should have been strongly suspected and was evidence that many of you had access to.</p><p>Janice and I both didn't spend enough AP. We both had IT expert. I had a bed as well. I overflowed SO MUCH AP this ship. Sure, I did some human stuff, and I only spent 3 AP on actual mush activities.... but I threw away (because the time was not right) so very, very much AP. You guys could have caught that too.</p><p>Finally, you had one last chance to stop us, when I transferred to Jin, because I left Jin able to scream about it. Wasn't a problem that he screamed. Confusion was good, there was only <em>one</em> action I did not want you to take - guarding FC before I got Jin into the room.</p><p>Therefore, when you have weird mush action, might be a great idea to guard FC just in case, especially if you're a room away. Because really, that was the only thing that COULD have stopped that rush in the last moment. It still might have failed, especially if the guarder was NOT Chun and there was only one; I had already transferred but I could have spored and spiked the guard while Janice ran up to transfer into them and break the guard.</p><p>One of the most problematic things for us was Ian in alpha dorm. He left it the cycle before the plan ended, but we had to wait and have extra AP to deal with spiking Jin with Ian present and transferring with him present - in addition to getting Pilgred finished.</p><p>The core of the plan: Wait until Raluca and myself (I was already there) had enough AP to finish pilgred for sure. Make sure Janice had one spore from a previous day (she already did). Make sure both D3 spores were available for me to phagocyte in CASE I had to, to deal with Ian's presence when I tried to transfer after maybe spending all AP on Pilgred, and also to deal with 'what if Jin has 0 AP and moves when I transfer into him?' I had fertile, so could freely make 1 spore per body if needed, despite constipaspore and so made a plan that at worst needed one spore to phago for Eleesha body and one spore to fertile for Jin body, which would get me to bridge with 2 AP for getting us home.... but left me unable to spore and spike a possible blocker.</p><p>Yep, Jin being low AP at all times, and/or by Ian, is part of a potential defense against a pilgred rush.</p><p>We did not finish Pilgred until Jin was on the bridge, to reduce the odds that you guys would recognize that you were being Pilgred rushed. However, any obvious spiking of Jin should be taken as a potential Pilgred rush starting, <em>even if as far as you know, Pilgred is at 0%</em>.</p><p>jin, you were online. If you had ran from the room soon as you saw you were spiked, and get onto a fighter ship, launch.... well DANG that would have stopped the Pilgred rush plan too, and I couldn't have countered that... I know Chun had the hacker kit. If you'd seen and had the presence of mind to do that, you could have saved your team. It's worth doing <em>just in case</em> if you are Jin and see yourself spiked obviously. Because there's so few other counters.... and if you can get away, that is SO effective to ruin mush plans.</p><p>Once Pilgred was visibly finished, it was too late for you. A headshot or heartstab on Jin <em>immediately</em> after that would have stopped me in time. But you probably were not in position to pull that off.... Catching that Pilgred rush in the days before it started, by suspicion about Eleesha not spending enough AP, and Janice too (and a few others.... pressure and suspicion would have gotten me spending more AP for sure to fit in!)... checking on Raluca's room (and finola's in medlab, dunno if that one was watched), anyone who is alone all the time..... Chun can check or the room the person is in can be changed at least once a day and examined by several others for evidence of suspicious stuff.</p><p>Those are all my ideas about how you humans could have caught the mush plan.</p><p>It was a great ship. Gioele had just tutorial starved, but the rest of us were all active. We had a pilot initial magebook, and then we got a shrink and some other awesome second Xyloph book. We had O2 ducts that were working overtime, though Frieda kept finding O2 + deathzone planets.</p><p>People were friendly, coordinating, seriously playing. No griefers, no jerks; Hua stood out for having walked in on Raluca and claiming she didn't read beforehand to not - that's not bad behavior at all, was an honest mistake, for all the ship started to talk about killing her for it. By the end of D3 I think we had 4 or 5 research and 4 or 5 projects done. The ship had a LOT of advantages.... all it lacked was greater suspicion about how AP was not being spent and a few other worries about what the mush might be doing and how.</p>

                <p>Well, I said all stuff like that when we discussed how PILGRED rush can be countered...but the main answer was like - PILGRED rush with Raluca is so op, no counters. Damn, after I read last words like "Nothing we could do really" I want to make such rushes any time I'm mush, until humans stop crying and begin to develop strategies to counter them.<br>Two seasons ago commander-mush abadoning expo was quite common thing, but players learned how to deal with that, and now it requires to be very tricky to do anything like that.</p><p>Even if Raluca is alpha-mush, you can just count her ap - it requires 20 to get from 0 to 100, ok 16 with free points - anyway quite full ap+spores. You can even kill her, if you see such action, or guard FC with Chun, until she answers about every single ap point.</p><p>But I see why it's happening - a lot of players think, that if they do "their part" right, they should win (like Paola just doing comms, leaving bridge to take food). And ofc - if they lose - they either blame other humans for lots of idles or mushes for "cheap" tactics. Ofc - leave investigation to Eleesha alone, even if she is newbie/idle/mush.</p>

                <p>The ship had four techs; Raluca was useful, not needed for finishing Pilgred. But her desire to be left alone, and how she pushed that, actually made it easier; I waited a day to see how people would react to her desire to be left alone, and watched the whole ship of course to see where there were exploitable flaws; Raluca was left alone so she became an obvious easy link. Originally in RAT; I planned to guide Janice to her from one direction, me from another, so our paths never crossed and it was a bit harder to read from roomlogs, but then she logged in like the cycle before we were going to take her, and spent so much AP in the nexus that she couldn't get back to RAT and warned people to leave her alone in RBS. So I knew then she was probably 0 moves, 0 AP. We took her about 4 hours after she last spoke, by then I assumed all were content that 'leaving Raluca alone' was the thing to do.</p><p>I was scared an hour after we took her, for Hua announced fixing a newly broken fuel tank. Hua didn't say anything else, so I guessed she fixed the one Raluca wasn't in.</p><p>Hua, or anyone, reading the very obvious RBS logs, or even the (to me) highly suspicious RC logs for the cycle we converted Raluca had a chance to catch mush right then. But it takes experience and an interest in the room logs - Hua not only didn't read them RBS logs at all, apparently - she hadn't even read the chatter to know that she 'shouldn't' have gone into Raluca's room. She knew many hours later and apologized about it then, so she was reading, just not currently.</p>

                <p>I don't know how well 'throw them out' works against guarding. But there's no limit to how many characters can guard a room. Also, after a Pilgred rush, there's usually not a lot of AP left on the mush side of things. But the more time gained for the human team, the higher the chance of someone else getting into FC and guarding before it's too late.</p>

                <p>I think I'm a fan of a long run even as a Mush - trying to find a way to convert someone and not go for an easy victory. Pilgred rush in my opinion is just... quite boring. <br>On casting ship Aerial once made one thing you put as an idea to counter that strategy - guarded FC and as Janice he even declared ceasefire. But to do that you need to be active in a certain moment. <br>I had my eyes on you Eleesha, because in my opinion you stayed too long in a bed. At first you moved around the whole ship, saying a lot, but later you were surprising quiet - I'm not sure you were doing any checking at all which was suspicious for me as well. Unfortunately so soon there wasn't many people to contact and Chun didn't answer to my messages. <br>I was Terrence... And he isn't too good for checking logs... Also your timing was not really great for me. When the Pilgred Rush was done I wasn't around. But I was just a moment before only to notice that you left the room and later to see two dots in Engine Room. Suspicious as hell - but unfortunately I had to leave and couldn't stay longer online... So the only thing I did was to send a message to Roland and Chao who were online at that time, hoping they could do something about it. <br>But as most people I suspected Hua - her excuse was rather lame, so Janice was out of the picture - for me at least.</p><p>Still it was nice to be on the same ship as you, Impet <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Too bad it was only a short time.</p>

I learned that hard way - on a mush casting ship we had a plan to hide on the bridge and ask Chun to guard FC to keep Mushes away from Humans. Later Aerial said that it wouldn't work... because he as Chao would just kick out the Chun from the room.</p>

                <p>I still remember Impet as Mush Eleesha when she converted me. Before this, I had the chance of killing her because there were 2 proven humans and 9 people alive, 2 Mushes still. I was surprised that she's still investigating everything. And when camera in Bravo Dorm got broken, she put a drone, instead of repairing this because "she didn't want to get dirty".</p>
