                <p>Well now, that was a blast.</p><p>I am truly thrilled to have experienced such a compelling ship in the last legs of Mush.<br>I was inhabiting Chun, <strong>QUEEN CHUN</strong> that is, and have just died on my ship a number of cycles ago. Or outside more precisely. This <strong>QUEEN CHUN</strong> was quite the manic character, modelled off tyranical Chuns I had experienced. She was convinced the purpose of our trip was to extend the influence of her Queendom.</p><p>Our ship has been hilariously ineffective. It took serious campaigning to get someone to read the medic book. We forgot that Finola became chef and started the investigation of the mystery chef. On day 16, the medikit vanished for 6 cycles. At Day change, we would be occupied with the tense activity of hacking the ship because of our commander Chaoâ€™s very strange level of activity. (To be fair to him, he didnâ€™t intend to be conferred the commander role, I thank him trying nonetheless). Starting expeditions was like a part-time job, it took so much energy to get people to Icarus bay.</p><p>I think there might be 23 pieces of broken equipment, 10 doors broken and 6 fires right now. BUT they are going on expedition instead ðŸ˜ƒ.</p><p>Yes, I am still watching my crew. They are trying to make it to Day 20. Thereâ€™s only 1 cycle to go. If they make it, I will wonder whether they are the most dysfunctional crew of mush ever to make it to Day 20. Hopefully, they will return to sol.</p><br><p>As soon as I died, the Finola of the fake news pushed the rumour that I had intentionally killed myself so as to join a casting game. Ridiculous! But amusing nonetheless. Unfortunately, being dead means I canâ€™t defend myself from Finolaâ€™s comments about me as a player. So I do hope that you players, that I really enjoyed sharing the ship with, were not swayed by Finolaâ€™s baseless lies.</p><p>I suppose a narration of Queen Chunâ€™s dying moments are necessary for them to understand what happened. Iâ€™ll let Queen Chun take over then.</p><p><strong><em> ( D18C8 ) </em> </strong><br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">QUEEN CHUN</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"> Picking up Scrap Metal is so EASY. Only a fool could fail at this. I fail to understand the PEASANTSâ€™ complaints and utter incapacity to organise themselves for such a SIMPLE task. Disgraceful! What am I doing out here? Now how does one land this thing? Lady Eleesha was distracting me with Questions as Ser Terrence gave me his OVERCOMPLICATED explanation of the machine. But I am Glad Lady Eleesha is learningâ€¦ She will make a good advisor for Princess Raluca when she is queenâ€¦ </span></span> <span class="tid_sideNote">Queen Chun gets steel plated in the head and passes out. (Yeah, I fell asleep out in spaceâ€¦)</span></p><br><br><p><strong><em> (D19C2)</em> </strong></p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Queen Chun wakes up with 1hp. She is not a pilotâ€¦</span> <span class="tid_preRoleplay">QUEEN CHUN</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"> Huh? What? NERON land this Damn thing! GET this chunk of Metal off of my arm! NERON! Vizier Janice? Damn, these garbage CLOCKWORK CONTRAPTIONS do not work. I see Enemy Combatants about! <span class="tid_sideNote"> There are 44 hunters </span> It would be selfish and cruel of me to humiliate my people by taking them all out! I will summon my Valkyries for a great hunt! Lady Hua the Flying Boulder, oh how she loves shooting down these pests in my NAME. Mayhaps the Lady Frieda will Join too? Ah! Here is the ACCURSED rein to return to the stables!</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_sideNote"> Queen Chun proceeds to crash land into the Daedalus. And in a great bang, the Queen was gone. <strong>Long live the Queendom!</strong> </span></p><br><br><p>Sadly, it seems the Princess Raluca soon followed Queen Chun by being steelplated. This left Prince Schrodinger as the Queendomâ€™s only heir. Hopefully, Vizier Janice will take her place as his regent and lead the Queendom to further glory.</p><p>What is great is that they are following my characterâ€™s last wish: to explore the planet Birionia to extend the diplomatic missions of the Queendom, and see as to whether a star fragment can be found. Not without difficulty, it has come to light that our few suits have become broken. I am sure Queen Chun would feel proud of her legacy. Long live the Queendom!</p><br><br><p>I am going to post a few of my favourite moments. The game is still ongoing, but the team is united as humans and will soon be returning to sol. I do not believe I would be upsetting anybody by talking about it now.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">Ian baffled us as a secret mush for 10 days. I applaud his tactic because I was on the verge of drumming up a killing spree of the remaining suspects (Ian included) by order of usefulness. I had a feeling it was him, but he was too useful to the Queendom, due to the excellent care he provided to the garden. <br><br>Unbeknownst to us, he secretly hope for the destruction of the garden. Luck would not favour his side and after multiple incessant deliberations (and 10 days), we concluded that he had to be the alpha mush and inferred that nobody was being infected, as no activity was showing on the mush channel. <br><br>We used the serum, non-violently resolved the mush problem, and kept our very useful gardener.</span></p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">Gioele woke up one day, and perhaps after hearing one too many of Queen Chunâ€™s complaints and suspicions surrounding Kuan Tiâ€™s odd activity and limited communication, proceeded to beat Kuan Ti to a pulp, to an inch of his life. Raluca also reported that Kuan Ti had eaten a ration in the Nexus. Queen Chun was certain that Kuan Ti could not have accessed a ration. She was nearly certain it was a spore. <br><br>Although the assault occurred without a complete deliberation from the crew, sensing an oncoming lynch mob, and evaluating Gioeleâ€™s contribution to ship as vital, Queen Chun supported Gioele during this beatdown. Then a Steel Plate fell on Kuan Tiâ€¦ <br><br>After Kuan Tiâ€™s death, Queen Chun proceeded to blame all steel plate events on the Ghost of Kuan Ti. Eventually, after taking one too many steel plates, Gioele perished. The Ghost of Kuan Ti had started with his revenge. <br><br>Queen Chun felt her subjects were spooked. To make matters worse, Vizier Janice and Ser Terrence never got around to committing the dark ritual to make the ghost move on. It was a grave Error. The Steel plate in the Pasiphae led to Queen Chunâ€™s death. Princess Raluca found herself steelplated soon after. The Ghost of Kuan Ti had struck once more! </span></p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">Another one I really enjoyed was when Raluca with very little ap, mistakenly repaired a patroller instead of the Pasiphae at highly critical moment. Which made her immediately repairing the Pasiphae after that glitch so much more rewarding. </span></p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">We were making last ditch expedition after last ditch expedition as our oxygen supplies were running low early in the game. We could not get oxygen to Daedalus no matter what we did. Cycles passed until we finally hit the dreaded 0 oxygen, after arriving at another planet. We had kept Roland the Inactive Mush alive. We hoped the Elder gods would take him. They took Stephen insteadâ€¦ <br><br>We had no time for mourning, despite the pain and disappointment. We launched an expedition. The team was set to return to just before cycle change. Just before someone else might dieâ€¦ <br><br>Every zone we hung on. Waiting and hoping for that oxygen zone. Hoping the pump would not fail. <br><br>But the oxygen never showed up. There was a moment of resignation. We had given it all and yet nothing again. The Queendom was not meant to be. We returned to Daedalus with great disappointment. <br><br>And then a miracle happened! I could not believe my eyes. We had 24 O2! Right at last moment we had entered the Oxygen zone and retrieved the O2! </span></p><p>Post here if you were on this ship and would like to talk about our great moments. Medals go to all of you for making it a hilariously fun experience with limited conflict. ðŸ˜Š<br>I really enjoyed this game of mush. I think I have been waiting for a game like this for many years.</p>

I promise I had selected the Pasiphae (I clicked it and hovered until the name appeared to be sure) then clicked repair - then it fixed the other patroller. Urgh. But thank you to the RNG anyway.</p><p>Idk if getting 3 steel plates a day is normal, or maybe the steel plates just like the fact that I'm a technician and are saying "Use me for something!" by dropping on me.</p><p>I hope Prince Schrodinger has ascended the throne to become a benevolent ruler.</p>
