                <p>Okay, where do I begin.... In this ship, Janice quickly took charge, and we let her. But she was acting extremely mushy. We saw her getting ready for a final mush showdown. But she was injured. She went to the medlab to get help from Finola, but we chatted privatly and when I got online I KILLED HER. I had gotten a magebook from Xyloph about Psycolygy and I , as the comms oficer took the new charge of Janice. Then we killed the mush. This is the best human play I've ever seen. Ian, Fin, Chun, Freida.... Thank you. You where amazing. Janice, Chao... Best mushie play I've seen. Ah, If you'de only taken uot the section on mush psycology from the book you might have won.</p><p>I was Paola if that's not obvious. <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1395" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1395</a></p><p>Roland, Hua...

                <p>I agree with your last words that this was a very interesting ship! It was the most enjoyable one I've played since beta and just goes to show that you can pretty much be doomed from the start and still have fun. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It looked from the start, if not doomed, then at least a long shot when we discovered we had both an inactive Jin Su <em>and</em> an inactive Raluca (and, actually, we had a worse than in active Raluca: she woke up, took the mush sample, and went to the bridge and waited to die of depression). Luckily Paola was a superior Comms officer and quickly got the Xyloph DB that made the sample irrelevant (otherwise Eleesha was gonna punch her to death).</p><p>As Chun <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"> I spend most of my time jailed in the Lab to do anti-Mush research since getting the ghost of Chun didn't come until much later. I've been trying all the characters (2 left to try now!) but have already discovered that I'm a Mush Hunter at heart and being cooped up in the lab was making me squirrely.</p><p>However! It turns out it would have been better for me to stay there after I killed poor Hua rushing and mis-reading that we were all on board before moving the ship. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The next day we would lose Roland to the same fate through the actions of our nefarious hidden Mush, Chao, who'd become the commander with the passing of our useless Jin.</p><p>That was two more great players down on the heels of Terrance that we also lost to an O2 crisis leaving us both pilot-less and tech-less.</p><p>It spiralled downhill from there with the Hull taking a beating and and our O2 running low again. I decided that the only thing to do was marshal our remaining crew (even though I also felt like at least one of those was probably Mush too!) to kill our darling Janice, who I'd come to believe was Mush.</p><p>Paola took her down revealing that we still had at least one left. I'd thought it was most likely Paola herself since I could have sworn she ate a ration brought to her by Janice but since, it turns out, Janice was not the alpha that very well could have been a clean ration.</p><p>Instead Chao gave himself away as the last Mush by beating on Finola, which brought me to go after him with my knife and lovely hippie Ian to finish the job (very impressive since he was a pacifist going after an armoured Chao!).</p><p>Killing him was our last act before we all blew up cheering at having got him.</p>
