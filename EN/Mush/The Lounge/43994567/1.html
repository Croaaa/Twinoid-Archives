                <p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6562" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6562</a></p><p>Gioele/Frieda here.</p><p>Ship got off to a decent start. Frieda initially suspicious, due to insufficient scanning, but running through the math with a few other hunters we got whiled away in details, and there were enough people not doing anything to spread the worry around, including Janice, Kuan Ti who had been standing around in a dorm for almost a day without picking a skill or doing anything, and Eleesha.</p><p>The next day, Eleesha stabbed Paola for no apparent reason, then declared that she apparently wasn't mush. Eleesha was put down (human, natch). The resulting diseases cleared me, Hua and Jin Su as human.<br>Later, Janice switched dorms, triggering Bravo Dorm to be defaced. Stephen went after her, Roland spoke in her defense and attacked Stephen, Stephen killed Roland (human) before finishing off Janice (mush). Kuan woke up in the meantime.</p><p>There was some dithering about who the last mush was, with me trying to push the case against Frieda. In the midst of discussion, she came into Alpha Dorm dirty, and in the same moment, the logs got cleared. I shared this with the hunt channel, picked up the knife and blaster beforehand and stabbed her with my remaining AP.</p><p>At which point my unflinchingly handsome if aged chassis got transformed into that of a decrepit skeleton. Alerted the crew as quickly as I could, but Raluca still emptied a blaster into me. Was at 4 HP and bleeding out from slicing a vein open earlier.</p><p>Kuan said he'd seen a log of Frieda spiking Terrence from before the logs were defaced, and it fit. Janice had worked in the Nexus before he had, and he'd been in Bravo Dorm at the time of defacement, so if Frieda died and was anonymush, definite convert.</p><p>Gio got stabbed and we had one mush left, Terrence transferred into Raluca, killed Stephen the shrink and Kuan, Raluca got killed, there was some healing with both me and the new Terrence bleeding out at a rate of one HP per cycle, we had one day's supply of oxygen left but Frieda had an O2 planet with a mankarog up on the terminal...</p><p>With two techs (Hua and Terrence), it seemed inevitable that we'd get Pilgred done, unless an O2 tank broke when they were away and remained unfixed for a few cycles, in which case random chance might guarantee one of their deaths. I had us set course to the O2-and-mankarogs planet, setting it up so even if some of us died, one of us would have to return, figuring that a certain chance of death for a few actives who weren't vital for a win was at least better than the random possibility of our last chance at a win occurring. Even if some of us died, Hua and Terrence could relay it up on cycle seven or eight when she got back and have Pilgred finished.</p><p>Except I forgot about one thing. Depression death.</p><p>I and Jin died on that expedition, Derek brought back the O2, and Hua and Chun died of depression. <br>Bugs me a bit that we would've made it if I hadn't leapt into action, but it's a good lesson about patience, I s'pose. Had a great deal of fun, otherwise, with Kuan especially being a nice surprise.</p>
