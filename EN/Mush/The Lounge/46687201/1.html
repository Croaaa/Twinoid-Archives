This was my first time as <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"> , so the mush hunt was very engaging for me. Most of the hunt I spent chatting with my trusted team - confirmed Finola and super-secret-ninja Chao; after killing Eleesha due to unconfirmed suspicion we formed a larger team, which, luckily enough, consisted of humans only. We were suspicious of Frieda, and when she tried to either rampage or hack the ship during expedition, we stopped her in time. I guess our strategy of careful hiding of all weapons and hacker kit paid off <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The mush hunt ended about day 4 when we decided to get rid of not-so-inactive Giole, who indeed turned out to be mush. For next few days, I was still a bit suspicious of some members, and I'm very happy I was wrong about that. We built <em><strong>second sofa</strong></em> (awesome!) and concentrated on expeditions. Unfortunately, after 8 explorations we still had no Starmap Fragments, and when Chao got lost in Cristalite zone during the last one and was found dead (which was real bad luck and a really sad moment for the ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"> ), we decided to return to Sol. Hunters would get us otherwise soon, anyway.</p><p>Best thing about this ship was the crew <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It was great to spend two weeks of time with such great, uplifting people! I'll post more about the crew later. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway, hope to see you all around! And thank you all for the great time we had together! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hi, Paola here.<br>Thank you all for an <strong>amazing</strong> couple of weeks!<br>At first this ship didn't seem too promising: a few inactives, slow progress on the projects, average progress on research, semi-active Ian. Chao and Eleesha were weird, with Chao silently lurking the corridors. With that many people idling in the corridors, seemingly absent progress on the mush-hunting front and no tracker on the ship, I thought that this ship would descent into the abyss of mushiness for sure. But wow, it picked up in the days to follow. The project team started pumping out those projects one by one, Finola/Chun duo made incredible progress in the science department. Terrence has built an army of awesome drones, Ian has made our garden into a banana paradise. Swarms of hunters did not have a chance against our awesome pilots, Hua and Roland. Hull was being constantly reinforced and pretty soon both the PS and the hull were almost at a 100. Meanwhile, our marvelous Chao broke his oath of silence. Frieda accidentaly blew her cover and was swiftly disposed of (great mush-playing on her part, lots of love to you, Frieda). Semi-active mush Gioele was slain too pretty soon. It was getting obvious that this ship could make it all the way to Eden! On D7 I've finished all there was to be done with comms and diverted my attention to scanning for planets. Some terrible luck on that end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> With both me and Chao scanning, we couldn't find a single Cristalite planet for another <strong>week.</strong> Then Chun waltzed into the Bridge and found our first Cristalite, Yay! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"> That planet turned out to be a death trap. Chao went MIA in the Cristalite zone and we found him dead later on. Rest in peace, friend. I've barely escaped death, returning to the Daedalus with 2 hp left. At the same time, our pilots had to become inactive, because of IRL affairs. Stephen and Jin were inactive, fires and hunters started to destroy our vessel really fast. So we went back to Sol on D15. Which is a huge victory for our great ship!<br>So, once more, thank you all for this ship, it was an honour flying with you! Hope to see you all around!</p><p>PS: Chun, please ready up for the casting flight<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hey! It's Finola! I've said already how much I was enjoying the ship, but I would like to mention one more thing. This is probably the first time playing this game I actually felt bad irl for instance for suspecting people who turned out to be pretty awesome humans. And also the first time when I was really afraid to lose any of the crew members and felt actual sorrow when Chao was gone. Anyway, thank you all guys for this game.

Chao wasnt talking, some inactive people and so on. but after a few days i noticed how awesome everyone is. its just really sad how we couldnt find good planets and the worst part was when chao dissapeared and died... rest in peace! i wished i could bring us safely to eden with everyone alive so that we have some good memories together but it didnt go too well. anyway i am really glad to had you all with in this flight and wish you all the best luck for the next ships <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>P.S. no one mentioned even a single good word about my awesome "sniping" skills <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"></p>

(vanity on my part i know, so many factor were part of our success).</p><p>Here my experience:</p><p>The research team was awesome in blunting the mush threat right away.Which helped a lot to thrust that this ship was going places. But the ship overall looked somewhat normal, not a lot of people were talking and i tought there was a decent size of inactive.</p><p>As a gold player this kinda blew since such ship is like throwing my money away.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But Turn out i was wrong, and glad i was. I actually saw chun healing me in secret to make sure i was not a mush and i knew that the mush hunt was quiet, but it was there. As such i could give my all to this ship.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Shooting down hunter and helping people in the ship thanks to sprinter and shooter. I also took the 10 klik out of my wallet to get targeting assist to make this ship even more awesome. In the later days of the ship i learned that Firefighter is an awesome skill and roland is a powerful force to keep the ship rolling together. I liked everyone on this ship even frieda who turn out to be mush! She did a great job of being a sneaky mush too! I am sad to see this ship goes but i would play with you guys again anyday!<img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>It's great to hear from you all again <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Bobik42</strong>, I think I need a week or two pause from mush now (need to concentrate on RL stuff), so I'll miss this one, but I'll try to join the next one. I'm sure we will meet again sooner or later <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As I promised, here are my thoughts on the crew (in random order):</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chao.png" alt=":mush_chao_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chao</strong> helped me extensively with the mush hunt, and kept helping the ship even after. His strategy of keeping low profile made him suspicious, which was hilarious for me, actually <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Even though he was unproven for long time, I came to the conclusion that his extensive help during the mush hunt would be unproductive and perhaps even against the rules for the mush team, so I trusted him. I have to say, his unexpected death was one of the saddest moments in Mush for me.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/frieda_bergmann.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FB:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Frieda</strong> was clearly a cool player with love of good RP and it's a shame we had to kill her. She helped me before mush selection with item scanning, which maybe turned against her in the end, since it was suspicious that she cut all contact after mush selection. We were well prepared during that expedition after which we killed, though she still had some bad luck (she could find the Hacker kit and she was really unlucky attacking Janice).</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/roland.png" alt=":mush_roland_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Roland </strong> was a very dedicated and friendly comrade, who helped greatly to keep the ship safe from hunters, fires and even the mush and still had spare time to do some Astro and expeditions. I think I've never seen this character played so rich (and not just the Bravo Dorm/Bravo Bay routine).</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Kuan Ti </strong>was an enigma to me at first. He wasn't very active on the chat and the projects were slow at first, which made him a bit suspicious. But later in game, I could see he's human, because of his dedication to the crew <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/gioele.png" alt=":mush_gioele_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Giole</strong> was only logging in once a day to avoid being sold to Aliens, which was annoying and somehow funny at the same time. I'm usually suspicious of inactives, and especially those who show some sporadic activity (thus showing they are not newbies). Usually leads to rampages... Thus, Giole was an obvious target to hunt down.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Eleesha</strong> was a wild card. She started her own mush hunt, but unfortunately, she was in minimal contact with me, and she kept sabotaging my efforts (she kept finding hidden items and publicly hiding them in Alpha Dorm, which made it easy for the mush). The fact that she had the Observant skill (which is actually useful for Mush) instead of Tracker was suspicious, too. I hope she can forgive me for framing her.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Janice</strong> was not as active as some other crewmembers, but everytime she was, it was pleasure to work with her <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> We were unsure of her human/mush status at first, but when Frieda attacked her, she was pretty much confirmed as human, which was a big relief.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/jinsu.png" alt=":mush_jin_su_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Kim "the Sniper" Jin Su</strong> was doing good job with his Commander duties, but sometimes he messed up in really hilarious ways! This almost got him killed more than one time - especially after his 19-hour long dirtiness. I'm glad the mush hunting team was patient with him in the end, since he turned out to be a really nice crewmate.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Raluca</strong> Not much to say here - an inactive newbie who never finished the tutorial. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/paola.png" alt=":mush_paola_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Paola</strong> was yet another friendly crewmate who done a good job on the Comms and turned out be an effective Astrophysicist afterwards. I was really scared during the last expedition that she'd die, wehn she dropped to just 2 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> ! It was a relief to see her alive in the Icarus Bay. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/finola_keegan.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FK:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Finola</strong> was a great support to me and Chao during the mush hunt, and she did awesome work on both research and keeping the crew alive. I wonder whether Frieda planned to infect somebody at first, before we rushed the research <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/jiang_hua.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JH:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Hua</strong> definately deserves the first place she has in the game honors list - she done good job fighting both hunters and running the expeditions. For me, it's rare to see this character played this well, for some reason, I always meet inactive, silent or mush Hua <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/ian_soulton.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_IS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Ian</strong> did good job running the garden and I'm happy he forgave me for my initial suspicion. It was really nice when he protected me in one of the turrets with his pacifistic spirit <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/stephen_seagull.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_SS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Stephen</strong> was similar to Janice in the way he was not so active, but when he was, he helped as much as he could. Wish we would hear more from him during the last few days.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/terrence_archer.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_TA:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Terrence</strong> was probably the best Terrence I ever met <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Both his Robotics and Technician work rocked, I've never seen so many upgraded drones around. One funny moment was when Terrence reinforced the shower and some crewmembers (including me) panicked that he actually dismantled it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>... Wow, that's a lot of text! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> But this ship deserves it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
