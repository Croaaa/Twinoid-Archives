                <p>Seriously??? Human crew went successfully to Eden around 2 days ago, everyone wrote how nice the voyage was in their last message and noone started even an Ap-thread? Are you sane? And now even <strong>I </strong> (who was killed as mush rather soon) have to start it? Humiliating!</p><p>Well, that was the ship:<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7979" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7979</a></p><p>Around 7-8 TE people did end on this ship and in exception of Chun and Jin everyone was active. Well, Eleesha seemed a bit nooby, but that was it probably.<br>Seems like they went to Eden, but I only know the beginning of the voyage.<br>I was mush here and wow, what a competent crew. <br>In the end it was an epic mush fail, but I would say: It's <span class="tid_strike">all</span> also Janice's fault. The witch. I wonder what woudl have happened without her. But let me tell the short mush story:</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"><br>I started as Kuan Ti and the ship started nicely even while not everyone was still awake yet.<br>Especially the RPing started promising, I wanted to start some dancing lessons with the girls, we wanted to dance Bachata and Salsa.<br>Frieda showed off by convincing uis to be a veteran dancer!</p><p>Regarding that...I guess here I made already one mistake: Trying to show off by using up my energy. <br>There was that nice armored corridor project and with these active crowd I used all of my designer points additionally to all aps to finish or almost finish the project.<br>Without energy left I returned to sleep. Zzzz (for several hours)</p><p>ZzzZ <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"> whoops, I was selected as mush (YAY! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">) , selection happened around 50 minutes previously, hm, let's see.<br>Damn, mush sample already found and in lab... mhh :/</p><p>Oh, I have Raluca as partner, powerful Raluca, nice!<br>mistake 2: underestimating the crew: Well, I had already my win on a MMM ship a long long time ago, so... actually I didn't want to go for pilgred rush and so I was speaking with Raluca about good old mush play where we try to convert people. In the end it seems we shoudl have went to pilgred rush , but well, it was fun nevertheless.</p><p>So I was observing the situation: Everyone seemed active, with exception of 2 people: Jin Su did directly go to a storage room as soon as he woke up and went offline -.- ???? Jerk.<br>And Chun seemed to be a newbie who did not even finish her tutorial, oh, she will die soon therefore <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>well, before they finished constipaspore I got me some spores, fortunately I got the bed in Bravo dorm.</p><p>So everyone else was staying in protected areas, how to get them? <br>Raluca and myself, we were both level 11 mushes and had no infector skill (that skill woudl have really helped here).<br>I assumed that when Chun is dieing soon, they may not be able to finish mycoscan.<br>So let's try out the trapper skill <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>Targets? hm...pilots would be most reliable to get, but maybe they are too good with research and we have to get Finola When she has one spore it would be easy to get her with help of defacer without too much suspicion... So when I had the opportunity that Paola was waiting for her prince to build the sofa, I went in. I took the stuff of alpha dorm, trapped a Bay, went to the lab to get the apron and built the sofa with the apron. So I prevented to get dirty, isn't that making me trustworthy? But that was not every part of the plan. To save Mps I dropped the apron in Front corridor, trapping front corridor and saying in research thread that Finola may please take the apron, I have used already too many mps ...</p><p>But here the fail started... Finola was totally offline for several cycles. Argh. damn it! &gt;.&lt;<br>If she would just have shown up, we would have spiked her at cycle 7, not totally at the end of the cycle, at a time where not everyone is looking what is going on and with defacing...</p><p>But that was not the only problem. JANICE.<br>Seriously, out of the blue she checked who is online, she wants NOW to research as much as possible. Can't she even wait for Finola?<br>Our rather newbie acting Eleesha was asked out by her whether she has aps. She had. And Janice was practically pushing her to lab ("Eleesha: where is research done? In Nexus? -Janice: nope in lab! Eleesha: Ok, I will go to medlab! "...). <br>And Janice went to lab even before Eleesha and even did a mistake...she didn't read the reserach thread and didn't take the apron therefore. Eleesha had to bring it to lab.<br>SO WHO GOT THE DAMNED SPORE, WHO? NOT Finola, NOT even Janice... ELEESHA! waaah! Eleesha, who seemed to be suspected already and well... rather a newbie.<br>Guss what happened 5 minutes later?<br>FINOLA WOKE UP! Why not some minutes previously, why, just <strong>WHY</strong>? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"><br>well, they researched all together and I think we had after their session constipaspore, antispore, mycoalarm and mycoscan was started already.</p><p>Damn it, That worried me, I feared they would definitely finish mycoscan soon, definitely before Chun is dieing from starvation and then...they may find out the spore on Eleesha and the spore on Hua (who activated her trap after piloting a bit).<br>At that point I shoudl have be more patient and changed my plans, maybe a better opportunity for conversion would have happened, maybe we still woudl have been able to do pilgred rush...<br>But meh, I decided to do the risky move to convert with raluca Finola in medlab around day change and with the use of defacer. I calculated that Chun shoudl die at cycle 5 the next day, probably soon enough that a mushy Finola could slow the research down long enough I thought.<br>At first that plan seemed promising: Ian seemed to be inactive at cycle 8 while a plant was ill. Finola was silent and didn't participated in any conversation in main chat. Good, probably not active. So I claimed to wait until nearly change and treated the plant in lab. Now I was not far away from medlab. Raluca shoudl just go to lab to cuddle the cat for morale, it shoudl be her excuse why she was moving around...fine.. Cycle change is approacing soon. Raluca entered medlab, got spore, spiked her, I entered, got spore, spiked her and...<br><strong>Main chat</strong>: <em>Finola: KT and Raluca are mush and have spored me. Please kill them imediately.</em><br>Seruiosly?????? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"><br>Day change, Finola is fleeing out of medlab...<br>refreshing.<br>she is hiding in the RBT, so I follow her. I arrive, extract new day's spore, click to infect, but...<br>"Finola left the room." <br>Where is she? bridge has 3 points, ok, bridge:<br>"Finola left the room." <br>Oh, geez...today is not my day (that was right, I was even suffering from getting ill in RL)<br>Ok, she is in CBT now, click, lick, click, click, infect! successfull! whew!<br>But the crew is alarmed already, damn it. Gioele is already wrinting in main chat, Frieda too, they are active as hell.. <br>Ok, let's go for Hua, she has already one spore, so Raluca and Finola coudl convert her!<br>I went to Adorm, took the camera and Finola/Raluca infected Hua. whew. At least...something, right?<br>Oh geez, Gioele is already punching me.<br><em>Punch, punch</em><br>Ok, let's retreat.. I ran to Bdorm.<br>What is happening here? Janice, the witch, is active (she told only some hours ago: "I will go to sleep now." I see how you are sleeping -.-<br>she picked up the blaster to shoot at me <br><em>shoot, shoot</em><br>Oh, what's that? she dropped the pilot book to take the blaster. <br>Ok, I read it.<br><em>Read book</em><br>Hey, I am a pilot now...but Janice will probabyl kill me soon, hm...<br>oh! there is also that Eleesha with one spore, I will use transfer, maybe she is killing my old body.<br><em>transfer</em><br><strong>Main chat:</strong> Janice: Kuan Ti did transfer into Eleesha, I noticed luckily that he became skilless <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"><br>Yes, you witch, well done :/<br>Ok, maybe confusion is helping..I printed the listv and destroyed it, I hoped they would fear to kill all mushes , rather try to cure one and give Hua therefore maybe time for her rampage.<br>Ok and Ian was inactive, maybe hiding there will help for a while.<br>And so I went to Ian.<br>well, I suggested Hua to stay undercover and save aps until tomorrow to kill teh techies and if possible also the pilots.<br>With Finola I planned to maybe do a fuel rush if we stay alive until cycle 4 (I found the hacker kit in lab and grabbed it). Then I had to go to sleep.<br>zzZZ</p><p>...<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>congratulation, you are dead!</strong><br>Raluca: <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"><br>Finola<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"><br>Hua... Hua <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"> tooo! what? How? why? there were other people in the same dorm..</p><p>It seems like the witch Janice did get some private chat-tab evidences which seemed to be enough for the human team to just kill Hua without second thought, meh.</p><p>And so that totally crazy but also frustrating mush game ended for me.<br>well, it was fun nevertheless. <em>Still frustating </em>. At least very emotional.<br>I am still very grateful for my mush partners! Raluca, though missing some opportunities to create spores, but fully supporting me and Finola, who did at least her best (after literally busting us all out).<br>Thx!</p><p>Lessons learned I guess and that the crew still managed to reach Eden is telling its own tale about them.<br>I would totally love to play again with all of you! <span class="tid_strike">Maybe without the witch though <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">.</span></p><p>So.. time to tell me more about your time without any mushes left.</p>

There was not one normal joke told on the ship. Everyone did it with their own weirdness. Terrence with his grumpy Euro RP. sigh more to repair sigh out of AP sigh I only have two alien bottle openers to boost my results sigh sigh so many sighs always out of AP never has ap sigh. Freida with her horny grandma routine. Roland with his arrogant, swearing, street talking cadence. Roland was a damn good player though. Such a strong all around skill set of knowledge, personality, and activity. He was probably the MVP of the ship, which is saying something given how many good players there were.</p><p>I won't reveal who I was yet.</p>

                <p>I was Finola... and very grumpy about being converted on such a lovely ship! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/angry.gif" alt=":anim_bad:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Not that I wasn't grumpy enough as a human, heheh. I had some fun with RP, getting my little passive-aggressive stabs in at everyone for bringing me on the voyage against my will, Chao in particular. Seeing him eulogizing a bit after my mushy self was killed made me go "Aaaw." :3</p><p>I was <em>so pleased</em> when the ship filled and I was not alpha mush. I am cursed to be mush when I choose Andie, and hate being a mushy researcher! Threw myself into research with gusto, and we got quite a bit done. The time window the mush chose to "trap" me was the worst possible (though they couldn't have known) because those cycles are when I'm sleeping and working. I came back to Mush with near full AP and happily joined the research party that had already convened in the lab, only vaguely worrying that they might have mistaken my IRL obligations for stalling. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Due to a very dramatic mush play on a recent casting ship, I made a point of being active on that D2 &gt; D3 daychange. I planned to do some tracker dot watching, since that had saved the day in the aforementioned casting incident. But I didn't even have the chance. When I loaded the page, Raluca had just arrived and pulled a spore. Welp. I immediately notified the people in the research tab of what had just occurred. Posting the PM refreshed the room logs and now Kuan Ti had arrived and spored. Crap. I took off immediately, right as day change hit. Ran to FAT.</p><p>I didn't have time to do any AP math, as far as guessing how far they could chase me. I knew I probably had two spores on me, and also that I was likely to be converted before this was over. My shoulder devil said, <em>"Well, you should stay quiet then, so that when you're mush things are a bit easier."</em> My shoulder angel promptly drop-kicked him and I posted my report to main chat. Even if it was my last action as a human, I was going to play for the human team.</p><p>Kuan Ti had arrived just as I posted. Shoot. Ran to the bridge, half-expecting the welcome message there. Nope. Ran to CAT and planned to dot-watch. I should have just taken off for the rear corner of the ship and just run back and forth until I had nothing left. In my panic, though, I wanted a close eye on what my opponents were doing. There were two of them and they could potentially cut me off. I was a little too slow in making my next run, and I was converted. Faaaantastic.</p><p>I popped into the mush channel and happily informed my alphas that they were jerks, then started trying to figure out how to best help them out. I ran to the engine room in the meantime, hoping to allow for playing still-human, but was called upon to finish off another mush. At this point nobody had a lot of AP, so the best way to hurt the humans was to bring one-spore-Hua to our team. Hopefully, dealing with four mush would spread their AP thin enough for us to have time to figure something else out. I finished Hua's conversion and then survived beatings from two crewmates with Hardboiled (round one: Frieda with the knife, who tore her tongue. round two: Roland, whose pathetic baby fists inflicted 2 damage in 5 swings). With ten minutes in the cycle I looked wistfully at the medlab that I was 1MP shy of reaching. I had two free heal points, and in ten minutes could bring myself back up to full health.</p><p>Unfortunately, Chao beat cycle change.</p><p>So while I'm bummed that I missed out on a nice Eden ship... that sure was a fun bit of drama. Would also love to hear more about the post-mush phase.</p>

                <p>Ahahaha, I'm so glad someone started a this thread. Thanks Sperbi! XD</p><p>Umm, so, uh, I'm the witch <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Janice</strong>. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> I didn't realise I played a role in accidentally thwarting the mush's plans!</p><p><span class="tid_preCite">sperbi</span><cite>Especially the RPing started promising, I wanted to start some dancing lessons with the girls, we wanted to dance Bachata and Salsa.<br></cite></p><p>That was fun! We were so sad that we couldn't continue our dance lessons...</p><br><p><span class="tid_preCite">sperbi</span><cite>But that was not the only problem. JANICE.<br>Seriously, out of the blue she checked who is online, she wants NOW to research as much as possible. Can't she even wait for Finola?<br>Our rather newbie acting Eleesha was asked out by her whether she has aps. She had. And Janice was practically pushing her to lab ("Eleesha: where is research done? In Nexus? -Janice: nope in lab! Eleesha: Ok, I will go to medlab! "...). <br>And Janice went to lab even before Eleesha and even did a mistake...she didn't read the reserach thread and didn't take the apron therefore. Eleesha had to bring it to lab.</cite></p><p>Actually, at that time I was super worried that neither Eleesha nor Chao were responding my "is mush hunting" happening questions. So, I took it on myself to test Eleesha's APs by encouraging her to relay me as much as she could with food. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I didn't forget the Apron too... I was carrying 2 rations and I didn't want to drop it in FC, so I asked Eleesha to take the Apron instead. So <em>THAT's</em> how Eleesha got her Transfer spore... I've been wondering for a while back then! Whew! It could've been me!</p><br><p><span class="tid_preCite">sperbi</span><cite>At first that plan seemed promising: Ian seemed to be inactive at cycle 8 while a plant was ill. Finola was silent and didn't participated in any conversation in main chat. Good, probably not active. So I claimed to wait until nearly change and treated the plant in lab. Now I was not far away from medlab. Raluca shoudl just go to lab to cuddle the cat for morale, it shoudl be her excuse why she was moving around...fine.. Cycle change is approacing soon. Raluca entered medlab, got spore, spiked her, I entered, got spore, spiked her and...<br>Main chat: Finola: <em>KT and Raluca are mush and have spored me. Please kill them imediately.</em></cite></p><p>Hehe yup, Finola was awesome LOL. Thanks to her we caught two mushies before they can regain APs and rampage!</p><br><p><span class="tid_preCite">sperbi</span><cite>What is happening here? Janice, the witch, is active (she told only some hours ago: "I will go to sleep now." I see how you are sleeping -.-<br></cite></p><p>I did sleep... for 5-6 hours. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> It's not my fault, Mush turns me into an insomniac! (Also, I've now decided to not tell anyone but Chun my active hours while mush are alive... I just realised mush could use this info to decide when to rampage!)</p><br><p><span class="tid_preCite">sperbi</span><cite>Oh, what's that? she dropped the pilot book to take the blaster. <br>Ok, I read it.<br><em>Read book</em></cite></p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> I was super sad when you did that. I tried to save the book but ended up delivering it to mush hands anyway! Ouch! But, luckily, Roland, Stephen and sometimes Frieda held their own.</p><br><p><span class="tid_preCite">sperbi</span><cite>Main chat: Janice: Kuan Ti did transfer into Eleesha, I noticed luckily that he became skilless <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"><br></cite></p><p>Poor Kuan Ti was very surprised when he finally woke up, and immediately thought I was trying to kill him. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>My attacks with blaster did nothing but give me a burst nose, so I honestly did no significant damage to mush at that point. Luckily I noticed the transfer, or those 8 APs I spent would be a total waste! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><span class="tid_preCite">sperbi</span><cite>It seems like the witch Janice did get some private chat-tab evidences which seemed to be enough for the human team to just kill Hua without second thought, meh.</cite></p><p>What happened was that initially I wanted to see how many people had a secret PM tab by opening tabs with them. Turns out, Terrence, Stephen, Hua (and a few others) all had secret PM tabs, so that exercise didn't help.</p><p><em>However</em>, hours later, I suddenly noticed that Hua had closed a tab (by accident... I wasn't even looking for it), but she said nothing in gen chat despite the fact she had full APs and there were hunters outside eating our hulls!</p><p>I told the others this just before I had to log off. When I next logged in, Hua was dead. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><span class="tid_preCite">sperbi</span><cite>Ok, maybe confusion is helping..I printed the listv and destroyed it, I hoped they would fear to kill all mushes , rather try to cure one and give Hua therefore maybe time for her rampage.<br></cite></p><p>Oh yes, this totally worked. For a whole week and a half afterwards, I was secretly monitoring everyone and crossing names off whenever they fell sick or ate twice, just to make sure we had no more mush! I was even purposefully delaying getting our 3rd map piece, our Super Calculator research, and while also dropping Jumpkins in the dorms, hoping it'll be eaten by my remaining names in the list. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I was so worried that KT, Raluca &amp; Finola all had Infector (and other lvl 11 skills) and thus a secret mush trying to get to Eden!</p><p>Luckily by D13 I've crossed out all names. Whew. What a relief.</p><p>Anyway, I'll talk about post-mush hunt more after the others contributed to this! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hello people, I was looking for the AP thread as well. Congratulations to Eden!</p><p>Poor Hua here. Yeah, poor. You killed me only because of that PM tag. I had to close it because it took me 20 minutes of reading to get out of mess in messages and find out what the hell happened. I just woke up, find out me as Mush and three Mush people dead. Left as fresh converted one and alone.... I know I know, do not touch anything and pretend to not to be here till you can. But not that I had a chance anyway. It was 50-50 it's me or Stephen. Bam. I refreshed the page and was already dead. Thinking what to say on chat to buy me some time to think about some rampage. With 6APs (I was shooting/collecting before sleep) and all spores for that day already gone.</p><p>Could be such a nice trip, I was little bit busy during weekend hoping for roleplaying more from Monday. I still don't get it why you were trying so hard to convert Finola as first... But well, next time I hope!</p>

                <p>Howdy howdy! I was your <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"> Frieda.</p><p>I was planning to be a mutton dressed as lamb, quite strickt but genial to most of the youngsters, except maybe the naughtiest ones, full of advises here and there, of course (it's a shame to keep all that long life experience just to myself <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">) All that goes quite well with a survivalist I've had.<br>But welp, it didn't go as planned much - after mush-hunt there was not much time and space for RPing and relaxing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> and since Chun died early, I had to be much more youthy than it was planned, hehe.</p><p>So the ship was very <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/rd4GUmj.png">promissing </a>from the <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/xRe0yV7.png">very beginning</a>, we planned our work quite well, as well as the leasure time. Research went fast - we had Lenses and CS in the first day and AG plus Alarms on the second (iirc), tho' my ressearch participation made Chao suspecting me being the mush, heh. I've gathered some data in a black book myself: first of all was very concerned about Chao delaying picking the torturer and not doing any investigation (it might be wise to keep that ace in a pocket, but not with 5 cameras and alarms already on their way). His rather active participation in research was the only thing stopping me from classifying him as a mush. Also I was kinda concerned about Hua's piloting (the taking off/landing part didn't seem optimal) and probably smth else - don't remember already.</p><p>But that was until Kuan's building-sofa-run. He has already dragged my attention when pushing project just once after a good rest, despite all the pre-selection enthusiasm and camera, installed in Nexus. That (1 push walk and sofa run) looked like an excuse for extracting outfall to me. So I've decided to wait till evening and if the Nexus work won't be done - organize a hunt or just kill him myself after some ap regenerating (I was holding the knife at that time and that Blade of Death.. you know.. changes people..).<br>But almost the same moment I've posted in our girlish PM for three about Kuan, screwing off projects, Finola posted her Final Warning. Damn it! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/mad.png" alt="X[" class="tid_ico"><br>NB: (I was also concerned about Raluca's unwillingness to participate in projects a bit, but that thought didn't stick. That were all of my suspects.)</p><p>That moment I was very angry on myself cos usually I try saving enough for defence AP on the first after-selection days, especially the suspecious ones. But this time I took a risk and spent most on research, seeing lots of active people around. So I had some ap (8 or so, with the ration as far as I remember) to help with the killin, but definitely not enough mp for running after the alarms hiding routine. Ugh! Then I've had another idea how I could try saving Finola: - simply guard the adjacent room, Frieda! Go! But hm.. if Kuan has 2 spores..transfer to my body that was holding a knife would be a failure..</p><p>When I decided to take the risk and when Kuan/Raluca appeares - try using all my ap on hitting them so they won't be able to use my body in case of transfer (and I was almost sure they don't have enough to kill me), it was already too late <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> slowpoking all the way, yes - that's me. Meh. So the only thing left to me in that situation - was to man up and go stab poor girl with the knife she practically gave me herself and pass the relay race to others. And damn you bloody mushes that was painful! :V</p><p>So I hit Finola with all ap I had, while drowning in tears all the way, and ran to AD to pass the knife. But heh, there were 2 problems: 1) the room was defaced so I wasn't sure whom to trust and 2) I've lost my tongue in a fight. <br>So I just lay on a bed to think a bit. WIth a knife. After interacting with a mush ( I warned others I was going into stabbing Finola). Without saying anything. And no one payed almost any attention (though I thought I might not survive that), hehe. <br>Gioelle was active at the moment and seemed still human, so I stood up, dropped the knife and went back into sleeping. He picked it, but very soon after went afk for the whole night, hogging it, while others were trying to make a killing plan. Everyone was pointing fingers at each other and the whole defence operation was quite messy, but participating in a discussion was unavailable for me for a loooong time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So I've just relaxed till I'd have enough ap to bring my tongue back to life (tho' I've still dropped some news in morse code in irc and regret that a bit).</p><p>Raluca was the first one to fall a victim of Roland's blasters. Chao picked shooter and for some reason torturer, but still handled the other 2, while I was out of game, laying and watching. Hua's destiny is already explained by previous speakers (if only you hadn't closed the tab pretending to be afk, you'd save yourself for maybe daaaays), so I guess, it's the end of a mush epoch story for today.<br>(Will probably continue later; hope, I haven't messed anything up)</p>

Also converting Finola plan would reveal you 2 pretty soon even if it ended up as planned, cos we had a deal with Miss Witch to check on Finola every time we had a chance, so maybe it was better for you that things went as they did <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/surprise.gif" alt=":anim_surprised:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>It was a special ship, that's for sure! That Mush attack could not have come on a worse night for me (Chao). I saw Kuan Ti report that the plants were taken care of, and then waited patiently for him to come back. I quickly became worried that he wasn't going to come back at all, since day change was less than an hour away. But as luck would have it, I had to leave for a couple of hours very soon after that. Most, if not every day before and after that, I was available on the C8 -&gt; C1 day change; but not that on that night. I waited for Kuan to come back to the dorm, but by the time I had to leave and he still hadn't come back, I was really worried for Finola - someone moving outside the medlab right before the day changed is never a good sign. I tortured Raluca - not because I suspected her at all, just because I had neglected to do it earlier - and then left. I had even considered even PM'ing Finola and warning her to move to the Lab (with Ian), but decided to just check on Raluca like I had intended to before Kuan had moved and to hope that she would react if she thought she needed to. <br> Then I checked back with my phone about 20 or so minutes after I left and saw that all hell had broken loose. Raluca had left Bravo Dorm to go convert Finola within minutes of me signing off. &gt;_&lt; Once things were unraveling I tried to help in PMs as best I could thru my phone, but I wasn't very useful. Thankfully I had the chance to redeem myself by showing up in time to finish off the converted Finola, using Wrestler to throw Eleesha nee Kuan Ti away from Ian, and finish her off too. Finola was truly missed; our Research team never recovered from losing her. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Piecing together exactly what the Mush did from there was a wonderful headache. We knew Mush #4 had to have been made in AD, leaving Hua, Stephen, Roland, and Gioele as the candidates. Gioele and Roland were really suspicious of each other, but seeing as one pointed out there were 4 Mush in the first place and that the other killed Anonymush Raluca, both of them seemed innocent. While I was asleep, Janice managed to figure out it was Hua, someone finished her off, and we were Mush-free. Of course, none of us knew that for sure thanks to the list being torn up. We still had a few questions, like how Eleesha got the spore Kuan used to transfer. We spent a long time after that looking at each other with smiles and shifty eyes. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I was confident that the ship was Mush free. Maybe that was naive of me. A day or so after the fighting, Janice made a post with the gist of "because of this, therefore that, which means that they didn't have enough spores to convert anyone else, thus we are Mush free." So in the same way that I trusted the more experienced players when they said Kuan Ti had transferred to Eleesha, and that the last Mush had to be present in Alpha Dorm, I also trusted that the ship was clean. Also, based on activity and everyone's talkativeness I didn't pick up any bad vibes. The only time I got nervous was in the final days when Kuan Ti became very inactive and quiet, combined with reading an AP thread or two on here where a hidden Mush won the game.</p><p>Once the Mush were gone, I personally was quite confident in our ability to get to Eden. I wasn't sure how much variance was involved with finding starmap pieces, but one thing that was clear was that the crew/ship didn't have any bottlenecks. We had every area of the ship covered reasonably well. Janice + sexual tension handled morale. The pilots protected the hull. We had excellent Bridge workers. Terrence was handling all the repairs. The research and projects went along steadily (maybe a bit slowly) as did the gardening. The ship's commander was active and we did expeditions almost daily. Stephen and Gioele were very experienced players in utility roles. From my rusty point of view, it was hard to picture an area that we'd struggle in.</p>

                <p>Hmm.. Terrence here. Bronze players - Was no skills but was set to Tech after the mush hunts</p><p>I didn't know this is an old messages exist here and was July so might as well tell the stories... Even is the 3 months old message.. Can't hurt to tell the actual stories from my Tech sides</p><p>It's suppose to be a lucky day for me as Terrence.. I could relax in the ships since both Raluca &amp; Kuan Ti is a Technician and both of them is gold modes players if I'm not mistaken and I was in a lucky rolls in this ships when all crews active except Jin-Su.. And I was thinking maybe this ain't a bad idea to have Terrence having to relax and maybe to choose the robotic skills to gain my glory points upgrading the drones have the ships a life easy after the mush hunts.. <strong><em>But turns out to be a very bad idea when both of them are 'tech'nically an alpha mush.. </em></strong></p><p>If I'm not mistaken everything goes bad sides when I was asleep in AD.. When after three mush were murder and Raluca &amp; Finola is being murder right in front of me.. Which leave me shocking and puzzles me as well. I was standing sleep (if not mistaken). Was to recover half my ap after giving a false lied on public on my lack ap. Apparently Finola is the ones realize the who is the mush is.. But she's being infected and was killed which leaves 4 including me as well to be a mush victim. So I have to moved to BD from AD. Then Janice came to pm me in two separate pm tabs.. First tab is Stephen, Me (Terrence) &amp; Janice and Second tab is Janice &amp; Me (Terrence). Janice &amp; Stephen pm tabs keeps pressure and nicely threaten me asking me to pick Tech or they kill and also having Stephen to copy my skills (In end Stephen choose pilot).. Which I find pretty amusing. I was thinking that don't tell me they going to murder me if that cook apprentice copy my skills (I was paranoid).. Come on.. How can I be a mush if I'm asking for Janice comfort that I witness two murders in front of me.. and I was sitting my wheel chair sleeping in AD.. Having 1 murder is alright but two murder is too much for me resulting me having a psychology problem... So they killed Hua describing on pm being full or not being contacted.. I don't know how but least is the end.. So the ships lost two best tech, one main active researchers and one pilots <strong>So the ordeal of only Tech survivor begins...</strong></p><p>The reason on putting lots of <em>sigh</em> is due to lack of Tech manpower and worst of all is Terrence Traits handicapped but soon compensate by Sprinter magebook. <strong><em>Oh I'm sorry, Chun</em></strong>.. Who been repairing the damn junks defects ships and posting the detail on maintenance reports.. Wait...is me... But is was a fun character as Terrence, So I don't mind at for people tired or annoyed from my antics <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>List of my rambling Tech journals</strong></p><p>Requesting the drones to placed on AB &amp; BB as all patrol being electrocuted in turns.. In AB electrocuted patrol events. I have request for drones whereabouts so I even ask the ppl please placed the drones to repair for incoming hunters..But none comes requested on drones.. Which I have ask two times with no response which I gave up and I have to even wheel myself to take the drones and placed at AB... Then another sparks at BB patrol after the completion repair on AB..So I ask if the bridge were to go expedition mind carrying the drones to BB.. Luckily if I'm not mistaken Frieda have placed the drones for my requested at BB during the ships expedition route from Bridge to IB. Luckily I knew the drones position thanks to the Defective door piston where the drones is at FC after repairing the door from FS-CAT door.. Anomally detector systems is far worst which can't even detects correctly or even showed the defects on CBS &amp; CAS and even Fuel tanks as well in my tracker, wasting my ap/mp conversion for that . So my maintenance repairs keeps rolling down in my list alot from Door (only necessary but leaves a drones), Gravity Simulator, Patrol ships (only drones repairs but reports), Turrets (Not important but leave the drones repair to remove pesky icon), Pilgred, Engine Room, Oxygens &amp; Fuel tanks.. And this giving me alot of work since I'm the only goddamn tech in the ships and worst of all I'm the bronze Tech and this ain't favor me alot... The worst of all again is sofa problem at Bridge which gives me a real headache.. You do realize the Terrence as me a wheelchair even with Sprinter magebook have to push myself on bridge from dorms and is was <strong><em>two times the sofa break</em></strong> and what do I get is some sort of dirty joke with Frieda.. But just a light humor so I enjoyed.. Well this keeps getting better.. Engine room is another thing coming.. All equipment breakdowns from electrocuted.. So I placed the drones as usual and also I was kind enough to repair the Planet Scanner, Main reactor &amp; Right Lateral Reactor leaving the Left Reactor &amp; Gas Chamber to the drones I assume the commander have some decent ap to moved from hunters wave but our beloved commander Choa can't moved the ships due to insufficient ap so again I have to take the Jumpkin that I'm not suppose take and repair that last reactor..</p><p>As for Fire event... Well I have to extinguish myself but my role as firefighter soon took over by Gioele which helps me.. Also thanks for the two alien bottle opener from expedition that helps me alot and also I have to separate both in AD &amp; BD for ideal location for crew to repair themselves if I'm not around but sadly only Gioele is the ones doing the job repairing..</p><p>All I did was having a good schedule I set which have I'm free in my time zones to keeps the Pilgred &amp; P. Shield relays and asking who's kind to relay with me volunteer which Gioele and lots of you crews asking me to relays on, Great teamwork relays and being punctual on my time schedule request.. On P.Shield, that is also my part fault as well.. I did saw the Fire Detector projects together with the P.Shield and I was surprise you crews asking for P. Shield instead of Fire Detector from public post and I was assume that was discuss through who knows maybe through your crews pm private chat. So I assume you guys have decided... Anyway back to P.Shield well you guys sure knows how to push my patient buttons.. In the few relays to completion on that damn Shield projects after I dumped all my ap and going to BD to rest.. Janice asking me to push it to the end and giving me a rations. Which I rejected her and telling her that eating rations is a risk and losses waste and certain RNG probability is low chances to completes the Projects.. But, you guys sure loves Science works so I gave you the results that I have shown that you guys never believes me..... Is not completed and Kuan Ti steals my spots lights in completing the projects and also Kuan Ti being inactive and all which I was highly annoy on.. He could have saves my ass work on certain task but no... still standing in Nexus like a Liberty Statue and worst of all.. He's in 1 in first place.. really ? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>My only special thanks to Gioele </strong> who actually saves me from Tech load work even he's not a Tech in putting fires &amp; doing few repairs on certain CAS or CBS only.. This giving me a few work loads off for me.. But least is a little work.. Plus I have to rescue Gioele by repairing the damn door that he's trapped at Refectory.. I know there a 2nd sofa.. also least he help extinguish the flame at CC for me after I repair the Ref door.. That's is called teamwork <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But congrats to the ship crews for going to Eden with all the team effort to makes this far especially Frieda endless pursuit.. I enjoyed with everyone aboard the ships adventure with great personalities and stories and was my first Eden. Though I maybe a grumpy fellow and not friendly types but least I'm keeping this junks ships afloat and I ain't happy on... <em>Sigh, least that's my stories from 3 months worth</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/calmos.gif" alt=":anim_calmos:" class="tid_ico"></p>
