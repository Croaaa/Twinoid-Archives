                <p>AP for a super short journey: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8102" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8102</a></p><p>I believe 2 griefers and some mighty curse from the creepy SHOWOOR just made our mushlings to act so boringly. Quite a disappointment, but, well, I warned you, we shouldn't play with a fire.</p><p>Anyways, <strong>Hua</strong> is here and this thread is mostly for bragging. We had an AMAZING crew, with infectious Role Playing. I was pretty sure that it would be a long, long journey, so I could even train my abdominal muscles (so much laughing involved).</p><p>To be honest, I don't understand why mushies ended this so quickly, because I thought both of them enjoyed the ride and were capable for something more intriguing. I mean, yep, griefers and everything... But we managed to kill Stephen and Eleesha had her instant-report as well. We lost Finola, which was very sad, indeed, but we had a lot of people left there to play. As I've said before, that was probably the SHOWOOR, who whispered this evil plan to you. Or PILGRED trade is just too tempting for 2 mushes living on the Bridge.</p><p>Funny, that JS was a mush after all. He survived 2 attacks from our griefers and we were there to protect him. By the way, <strong>STEPHEN</strong>, if you're reading this. Despite JS was a mush I still consider your actions as griefing. You had no reasons for your attack. I read your last words and I think you want to play this game in the future, so I really want you to understand this situation. It's okay to suspect anyone. It's okay to try to kill him. But ONLY if you tried to discuss that with somebody first. Even if you have 100% proof that someone is mush (you saw him extracting a spore or infecting), it's usually a good idea to coordinate your actions with someone else. In your case, when your reasons were "he's holding an apron!" or "I think he is mush", it is absolutely a MUST to discuss that with somebody. If you were a good player, you'd coordinate with your team and MAYBE could even kill him in the future, when we would have some reasons to do so.</p><p>For the rest of the active crew:<br>Thank you for all that great RP! Me, <strong>JS</strong>, <strong>Frieda</strong> and <strong>Finola</strong> were a part of an organized jump (if I understood that correctly, hehehe), but it was my first time playing with those guys (well, girls) and it was a pleasure. But we were REALLY lucky to have so awesome <strong>Chao</strong>, <strong>Roland</strong> and <strong>Paola</strong>, totally random folks! <strong>Raluca</strong> was good too, even if not as active as the rest of the team (but come on, we were REALLY talkative!). Also, I would like to thank <strong>KT</strong> as well, he did a great job as a new player! And <strong>Gioele</strong>, who was there to report all griefer's attacks for us.</p><p>I would like to share some of my favorite conversations, but to be honest, I'm ready to copy-paste almost every single message. Yeah, that's how good it was.</p><p>Again, thank you, guys! Hope to see you all again.</p>

                <p>Chao here, wasn't sure if an AP would pop up for this, but I'm glad it did! I must admit I was shocked when I logged in to see the end screen - at first I though the Mush had showed their hand and offed me, but no, Mush return to Sol <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>One of my most entertaining ships to date, even if it ended way quicker than it should have done. I'm slightly disappointed with myself for not catching any mushies though, so credit to Jin Su for managing to pass all my spot checks. Surprised they couldn't convert anyone though (although I guess Frieda getting dirty would be a massive warning sign) - I was already assuming at least one conversion.</p><p>Ships like this make random jumps so worth it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I'd like to add, that even we managed to survive only for 4 days, there were walls of texts!<br>For example, just a common conversation, not in any thread, just every day (cycle) wall of text.<br><span class="tid_wspoil">(yeah, I know it's quite long, but I told you, I cannot choose my favorite parts)</span></p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Keegan, first of all, Neron haven't yet gave me a title. Second: why lenses research have not yet started? I had to pick the cat myself and do research MYSELF which, as you can suspect, a man of my position shouldn't be doing. And don't tell me you are afraid of that cat again! We've been over this!<br><strong>Finola :</strong> But... It is DIRTY! Germs are flowing thorugh His blod! Finola stood up and started to wash Her hands one time after another Ok... Ok... I will come and we can do... Finola puts on Her gloves <br><strong>Paola : </strong>Ms. Keegan has been taken here by force and you don't even give a minimum respect. Why is our commander so toxic and rude? I think we should pick a new one. <br><strong>Hua : </strong>But our second choice is wearing a terrarium! <br><strong>Finola :</strong> I should be new commander! It will be nice and clean here than! And no litter or germs! And Soap for everybody... looks at her hands Oh No! I have cat's fur on my hands! No! No! No!<br>It burns me Commander! It burns my skin! JUST LOOK! Finola points figer at her hand which looks perfectly normal It burns! It is whole red! I must wash them again! All because of that stupid dirty best! <br><strong>Chao : </strong>What makes you think that I'm unfit for command just because I am wearing a terrarium! Unless the penirafts have been poisoning your mind with their whisperings...yes, yes, scheming little whispering fruits, killkillkill, yes, yessss... <br><strong>Finola : </strong>Stop it You dirty Brute! Finola starts scratching Her hands, than quickly runs to Medlab and starts to wash them using some germs-killing chamicals You will only make more mess around this ship by squeeshing fruits! They will leave ugly, sticky strains! And germs will be growing in them! Multiplying... Killing us slowly! <br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Rinhaldo, rude doesn't even begin to describe your pickingness! I was going to advance a bill to institute a sofa for you in the bridge, and you are being picky with titles? That is going to come out of your salary young lady as soon as your father wakes up form that cryo snooze. (I wonder if he like it?)<br><strong>Paola :</strong> Paola looks at Chao and notices the huge terrarium on his head, "Wow, what mutations this salamander must got through. I hope it didn't hurt too much." She thinks. Well, maybe you're right, we should stick to our commander. <br><strong>Paola : </strong>Ha, Rinaldos don't need some salaries, this ship still would be in construction on Xyloph-17 if not my Dad's money. <br><strong>Roland :</strong> Them Rinaldos got money alright. Flying out here, I can see that the old man had RICH MOFO painted on the Daedalus in big gold letters!</p>

When we will have first grand inactive, than make sure to call me on bridge - I will try get better offer for us than just 11 fuel. <br><strong>Hua : </strong>Like.. Like 11 fuel and a tiny dog? Or even, just think about it, - 12 fuel?!<br> ...which is practically the same as 11 fuel and a tiny dog.<br><strong>Finola : </strong>Maybe oxygene insted? We will see... But no dogs! That best in Labolatory is eoungh for me! <br><strong>Hua :</strong> eoungh-word looks like something Gaelic. Are you okay, Finola? Your words are not in a perfect order. Didn't you..didn't you start to brainwash yourself? <br><strong>Finola : </strong>I am ok Hua... It gets better and better for me... I feel less and less germs on this ship. Finola takes deep breath This spray! It works! I feel it really works! Germs are disapearing from Medlab! Look! I only washed today my hands 15 times! Not 38 as usually I do untill this moment! But we have lot's of work! We still have germs around! I will have to do something about that. <br><strong>Frieda : </strong>We need a tiny dog!! <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Will Ziggy do? <br><strong>Finola : </strong>No dog! No way! Dogs are dirty! They spread germs! They poo everywhere! They spread germs! They can bite You! They spread germs! They smell bad! And they spread germs! Did I mentioned germs? Even if I did, it is worth mentioning once more! No dogs! Finola suddenly start to wash floor in medlab and very soon whole room is starting to smell just like if somebody would pour some spirit around <br><strong>Chao :</strong> A dog attacked me once. Once. <br><strong>Hua : </strong>They spread gems! They spread gems! They spread GEMS! <br>I've heard you, Finola. See, folks, we NEED this dogs, they spread gems! We would be rich! <br><strong>Finola : </strong>DID YOU KILLED IT? Finola stopped washing floor and is waiting for answer in tension Did You? Did? <br><strong>Raluca : </strong>don't think you will get rich on dog gems...hahahahaha...Ralu's failed attempt to a social interaction <br><strong>Hua :</strong> Everyone, look around! Find some dog (or maybe some germlings, that could become a dog with some evolution involved), and make them happy! We need more dogs! More dogs - more gems! <br><strong>Paola :</strong> Chao, because one time was all he needed to beat you? <br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Have no fear my dear researcher! Robo Ziggy can be cleaned by any of your lotions all day long. <br><strong>Chao :</strong> Paola, I will not dignify such an insulting assumption with a response. Hrmph <br><strong>Hua : </strong>But... gems?.. Oh, Raluca, I was already dreaming about my own ship with RICH MOFO lettering and now you said this.. Oh.. Well... <br><strong>Hua :</strong> Hua is starting to think, maybe she like girls too? Chao and Roland was good, really good, but now look at these Paola and Raluca! <br><strong>Finola :</strong> Drones... Yes! Dromes may be clean! And they may clean also! Right? And they don't spread germs! They can kill germs with flame-throwers! Or with laser rays! Or with some advanced anti-bacteria sprey! We need more drones! All of them organized in right order and upgraded symmetically of course! <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Ziggy, run! <br><strong>Chao :</strong> Drones? Clean? Not once I collaborate with Terrence to make the Tormentor-Drone prototype we have been discussing. It will be like a second me walking around, inflicting pai- extracting information! sadist <br><strong>Frieda :</strong> I highly doubt it would be possible for a drone to do, with the same expertise, what you do, Chao sweetie. It takes a special touch, you know? Frieda eyes the strange device resting on top of a chart on her desk; yes, the one with the tube and the pointy end. The old woman smiles slowly to herself.</p>

                <p>Hi <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I was playing as <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/finola.png" alt=":mush_finola_50:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I don't know what to say about this ship? There is really not much to be told honestly. It was too short to make me create long walls of text (which I am used to). I was happy to play as my very favourite character! I think that on this ship I showed importance of Medic skill as part of healtcare system, rather than just research bonus. But... I don't know really what to say here? Best will be if I will leave gameplay bits without any comments at all... Well... Maybe beside what I said in my last words - I do not regret anything that I did. But I regret things which I didn't managed to do. What I did that some could regret? For example I saved Jin's life TWICE. And also Chao's life. I was firstly medic, only secondly researcher on this ship. And know what? I liked it that way! Finola and Janice are definietly my favs to play, because I may concentrate on helping others. Greatly.</p><p>Role Playing part is another story! It was great! I had so much fun playing OCD person! And crew actually reacted on it in really possitive way, playing along and... Well... You saw conversations links, right? That was only small bit of what was happening on every day! And it was fun! Even people unraleted to our little group of 4 (Hua, Jin Su, Frieda, Finomino) started to take part in it! Especially funny for me was Roland - always dirty, he was absolute opposite of me - person with OCD who want everything to be sterile and always in right order. Oh yes! There was also that in my RPing. Everything had to be in order, pills needed to be in right alphabetical order in medlab, and so <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>When playing on RP heavy ships as Andie I could write long reports from planet exploration... As Finola I was writing long medical reports on those who were healed by Me ^^ So Jin Su and Chao got their medical report which actually was later disscused by crew in funny way. I just waited... OH! How I waited to be able to write medical report about my RPing Nemesis - ROLAND! Dirty and stinking Roland! He was RPing His character so great! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Wonderfull job! Everybody! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Even Raluca who was most silent of us all (counting only those who actually said something RPwise - not counting those who ignored RPing at all) had some great lines <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> She, as one working on PILGRED in dirty Engine Room was also kind of my RPing enemy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> But She made shower invincible ^^ Which was good for me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Funny part of RPing was also all superstitious faith in creature living inside of shower, which was called by crew "Showoor"... Of course as Finola I was not believing in such tale-tales <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And always labeled them as superstitions only, or was even challanging said "Showoor" into fight (on which I wated to come armed in all kind of cleaning stuff such as soap or alcoholic liquid to kill every and all germs). This ship was a ton of fun!</p>

                <p>Hello, I was Paola.</p><p>Dirst of all I want to apologize to human crew about this Pilgred trade. I knew there was a trader offering Pilgred and I wanted to delete it but I didn't have enough AP (decoded xyloph first, didn't notice new trader) and when I realised I had to eat ration from Refectory first to get 2 AP.</p><p>When griefer Eleesha killed Finola, I stopped in Laboratory to see if she had any reason to kill her. My big mistake was staying there, I should have refused trade immediately, this opened 3-5 minutes timeframe for mushes to get a win while I was contacting judges and telling people to not waste AP on Eleesha because she was already unable to do anything. I walked away form computer for 10-15 seconds and during that time transfer happened. I couldn't guard FC, I had Frieda on lvl 1 I couldn't level her up in time, Jin Su was literally faster by 2-3 seconds there.</p><p>Next time if I'll play as comms officer I'll make sure I have 2 AP always for rejecting Pilgred offer.</p><p>Anyway it was an amazing ship, the RPing was great, I had a lot of fun. Probably the best crew I ever played with. Unfortunately I didn't take any screenshots, I didn't except this ship would end so quickly.</p>

                <p>Not from this ship, but it was nice reading the AP Thread.</p><p>Stephen, once you read this, one thing: If you suspect somebody for being Mush and you don't suppose anybody to help you, find the Knife or use Solid muscles or ever shoot with Blaster if you're shooter, convince to unlock CorePeace or do it yourself if you're NERON Admin and throw some grenades. Then save your AP to 12, get a ration and you'll manage to kill the person. It happened to me many times that I had a reason which crew didn't get to understand, you have to speak language of weapon and it must be strong. Eleesha did this, you couldn't? Anyway, I'm looking forward to more details about how you hunted for Jin Su before failed.</p><p>And how did it happen that Paola had no AP and Mush could trade somebody for PILGRED. Granny explain?</p><p>And this ship was pretty fun. Better than my last PILGRED jump ship as Mush is not only very good RP, but also these lucky Mush of everything that ended happily for both of them.</p>

Stephen lied in the BD all the time, then just took the knife and went for a killing. His only accusation was that JS is holding an apron (which he did not). He never saw JS doing anything, because he just lied in the BD for about 12 or 14 hours. JS never entered BD, they haven't met.

They both (Elee and Stevie) had full AP, ate and Stevie had a knife. JS, however, had an Armor and some luck. Eleesha tried to kill him as well (no success), we forgave her even. She talked to us after that accident and she seemed reasonable. Bloody griefers are evolving! She was still for a bit, gained full AP, I guess, and then killed Finola, that was a pure griefing and she's been reported and quarantined instantly (thanx, Paola).</p>

You know... <br><strong>Roland :</strong> Put your antique sex toys away, ma'am, we're all friends again. <br><strong>Raluca : </strong>if we are all friends how come I sleep in a turret and you in a bed... hate you all <br><strong>Hua : </strong>Pointy thing on the end? You mean your nose, Granny? Sure, bring it on! <br><strong>Paola :</strong> By the way, talking about tubes and such. As a logistic expert I made some math and Jin Su would use less energy if he rolled instead of walking. <br><strong>Hua :</strong> Don't be upset, Raluca! Roland and I prefer to sleep in our patrollers, but this creepy Showoor.. We are nothing, but its hostages, girl. <br><strong>Frieda :</strong> Antique sex toys?! Young mister, don't you be telling me what this can and cannot do. There's as much antique about this as there is about me! And Hua, the things that come out of that mouth of yours, we should have the good Doctor Finola rinse it nice and clean with what ever she uses on her hands that make the skin fizzle a little. <br><strong>Hua :</strong> An unexpected lurch caused a sheet of metal to land on Hua. She is seriously injured! I TOLD YOU! I BET IT WAS THAT CREEPY SHOWOOR! I'm not afraid, you little monster! Do you hear that?! <br><strong>Hua : </strong>Oh, Paola, you're such a genius! I should try this rolling technique, since Terry don't want to give that Scooter and I'm so tired of these Lab-Dorm journeys. <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>I seldom try to jump like a ball... It helps <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>Paola :</strong> Oh, right, it appears that your body mass, volume and shape is more suitable for this type of moving too.<br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> You think so? Hm... I wonder if the walls of this compound can hold that type of movement for long... goes away to do his usual evening violin sessions</p>

New « Comms manager » : Paola. </span><br><strong>Paola :</strong> Hey, I need thick tube and someone to assemble sofa to improve my work efficiency. <br><strong>Roland :</strong> Thick tube? Isn't Jin Su already on the bridge? BOOYAH! <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Nope, I'm here with you my dirty Dorm loving maggots! Paola and Frieda should be aloe on the Bridge at all times to use logistics efficiently. <br><strong>Frieda : </strong>I think Gioele is taking a liking to my charms. He refuses to leave. In fact, he's staring at me right now... It's kind of creepy... <br><strong>Hua :</strong> I think he just want to steal some of your pills. Since we have only 1 coffee per day now, I guess he should have some kind of drug crisis. <br><strong>Frieda : </strong>No, no! These are mine! I need them to ... remember things. Important things! Like where the bathroom is. Nobody likes a stinky old lady! <br><strong>Frieda :</strong> Paola, have you seen my spectacles anywhere?<br><strong>Finola : </strong>I... Granny Frieda! I know where they are! I saw them! They were lying right on Your astro-terminal... But they were... Dirty! Bit dirty. I bet they were covered in germs as well... Tons of germs... So... I... Uhh... I took them in my hands... Through gloves of course! I took them and I cleaned them for You. Twice! So no germ could survive that. They were also dusty so You should be able to see better now. And they are clean! And no germs! <br><strong>Frieda :</strong> Finola! Why do you steal the glasses from an old lady. Waves a single finger, harshly. Shame, shame. Don't forget to disinfect the waffle maker, though. I think germlins might have gotten to it, when I was not watching, because someone stole my glasses! <br><strong>Finola : </strong>But... But... They were dirty! And covered in dust! And with germs multiplying on their surface! And they were not lying in it's place! They should be on shelfing unit! Not on Astro-Terminal! So I made sure that everything is in right order right now! <br><strong>Frieda :</strong> Are you calling my nose a shelfing unit?! Don't make me come down there and rise your mouth out with your special soap, miss Keegan. <br><strong>Finola : </strong>You are right Granny! I must wash my mouth! Like... Now! Finola runs toward sink and disolves some of soap in glass of water, than drink it Now... My mouth... And stomach! Germs killed! I can feel clean again! Internally cleen! Ouch... My stomach hurts. But if it hurts me like that, how much it must hurt germs? <br><strong>Frieda :</strong> .................. <br><strong>Chao :</strong> RIP Finola. She died doing what she loved. Being clean. <br><strong>Paola : </strong>What is dirty and supposedly covered in germs is not my business. But your definition of order is very... subjective. Order should allow us to work properly and how someone who is over thousand years old is supposed to see anything without her glasses? A relic like this should be treated with special caution. Just think how long she survived without washing herself. This is a special specimen. Please give glasses back to Frieda's nose so she can carry on with her duties. <br><strong>Finola :</strong> Don't look like that on me Granny! Finola puses for some time Look! If You want a bit also than... You can have it! Here! Take it! Finola puts some soap into glas and fills it with water Soon it will disolve and You can disinfict Your mouth and internal organs. You will kill all germs that way. It is good for Your health. And for keeping yourself clean. Cleaner than ever! Inisde that is. Inside... <br><strong>Frieda : </strong>And back in my day, they called it moonshine... now they've just taken the moon out of it, leaving the shine. I wonder if she sparkles on the inside... Frieda pauses, blinks, then adds in all haste! Chao! No! We need our Doctor alive and well! <br><strong>Chao : </strong>Yes, and if you add eye of toad and tail of newt you can make a love potion. <br><strong>Finola : </strong>What... What kind of idea is THAT? Eye of toad? Tail of newt? They... They are dirty! Ugly! No way I am going to take anything like that into my hands... Not even mentioning my mouth! So many germs inside of me... That can not happen! <br><strong>Chao :</strong> That's why you drop it in the soap-water first <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>Paola :</strong> Paola in awe takes all her cosmetics, her jewelery including ring fron Kivanç Terzi and her "personal blaster" and hides them under sofa Ms. Keegan, I'll help you out with your anti-germs crusade. Whole bridge is clean and secured! <br><strong>Finola : </strong>Not eoungh! Not eoungh! I will... I will put it into PILGRED! Yes! Radiation will help! It will kill everything! So I put it there. No place for Germs! No place for dirt! Clean and nice... And than I will wash them in water and my special soap. And than... And than I will still throw it away just in case! No germs allowed! No, no, no! <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Tomescu! Guard the .... uh ... please guard RBS, RAS, RBT, RAT, AB2 and Icarus! Keegan is coming!!</p>

Despite JS was a mush I still consider your actions as griefing. You had no reasons for your attack. I read your last words and I think you want to play this game in the future, so I really want you to understand this situation. It's okay to suspect anyone. It's okay to try to kill him. But ONLY if you tried to discuss that with somebody first. Even if you have 100% proof that someone is mush (you saw him extracting a spore or infecting), it's usually a good idea to coordinate your actions with someone else. In your case, when your reasons were "he's holding an apron!" or "I think he is mush", it is absolutely a MUST to discuss that with somebody. If you were a good player, you'd coordinate with your team and MAYBE could even kill him in the future, when we would have some reasons to do so.</cite>That is incorrect. Although coordination and discussion is <em>recommended</em>, it is not <em>required</em> for one to kill a person for being mush under SDF law.

It is good to hear that You keep bridge to be clean and free of germs! One less room for me to worry about! <br><strong>Hua :</strong> Yeah, thanks Paola! I would compensate that with a total mess in the BD. There is some slippers on the floor and these funny animals, that Roland made from med gloves and some small insects from Stevie's pockets and a bit of blood stains everywhere. Cozy, cozy place. <br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> That's why I never enter this place... BD is for nerds.<br><strong>Finola : </strong>SO THAT IS WHERE MY PAIR OF GLOVES IS?!! I will... I will put them into microwave! Yes! That will kill all germs! Into microvawe! If Roland thouched them they must be taken care off! Finola suddenly rushes to sink and starts to wash Her hands, than takes freesh gloves from shelf, and start to wash old ones Good that I have many of them in reserve... I like to keep this place tidy. I like it so much. Tidy... Clean... No dust! All will shine when I will finish it... <br><strong>Paola :</strong> And there's that scary shoowor, nobody knows what he's up to but he's staring into your soul. <br><strong>Hua :</strong> I tell you, what he's up to. He is up to no good, that's for sure. <br><strong>Chao :</strong> How dare he. Standing there all smug. Acting like we need him to wash. Like we need him at all. <br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Hua, I don't want to hear funny ideas about the shower! Keep that wrench in a holster! <br><strong>Hua :</strong> Oh, if only it was just a shower, Commander. It is not. It's some creepy SHOWOOR creature and I tell you, he's up to no good. <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Takes a moment to analyse the situation Hm... Maybe we need Finola to do a clean sweep it BD... My crew is starting to suffocate there because of all the dirty sock piles. <br><strong>Chao : </strong>Sometimes at night I hear it talking. Those- those gurgling whispers are from hell itself. I fear no man, but I...I am not ashamed to admit that that thing terrifies me. <br><strong>Paola :</strong> The legends say if you stand in front of it at midnight and say "Shoowor, I summon you" three times in a row, he will eat a random crew member. <br><strong>Finola :</strong> Finola prepares two sprays - one of nice smell and one of dissinfiction, than She takes small lighter just in case She would have to burnd down whole BDorm All right... Just show me where they are. I will get rid of all germs from Bravo Dorm! <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Will it give a project for that? <br><strong>Hua :</strong> Shhh! You said it once, we have 2 more tries and we are dead! Please, folks! I'm serious. Finola is right, mushlings are not the thing we all should be afraid of. <br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> What? You mean the Shoowor, I summon you thing? Don't be silly. It's for kids! <br><strong>Paola : </strong>Perhaps we should give gifts and pray to our Shoowor. Maybe in exchange he won't murder us all. <br><strong>Chao :</strong> Shuffles away from Showoor <br><strong>Finola : </strong>What a nonsense! There is no way that in Shower could live anything that would be evile! Not at all! Shower is holy ground! It is sacred! To take a shower means to come closer to perfection! <br><strong>Hua : </strong>Hua brought some candles, sat in the middle of the room and whispered <br>Showoor The Creature! Please, accept this sacrifice ans spare our lives and sanity! <br>Hua dragged Stevie closer to the Showoor<br>Take this man and let us be safe! ABRAKADABRA! <br><strong>Chao :</strong> Showoor fhtagn. <br><strong>Paola : </strong>Oh, Almighty Showoor, please accept this offering and spare our lives. Paola stands on on her knees and bows several times in the direction of Bravo Dorm</p>

He slept for more then a day. He didn't help at the beginning. He extinguished a fire once and repaired an apron (we thought he could be a mush actually. good excuse to be dirty and well, perfect timing. he was pretty much inactive before that fire) and then he slept.

Damn, this ship is just too good to be true, I'm probably dead. Tell me guys, was there a dozen of MURICA guys right at the beginning? They all killed us and now we are in space heaven, right? Right? <br><strong>Chao :</strong> If we're in heaven, I'm not impressed by the soundtrack.

Pity that soon enough, the tears will have to start. Maybe we should all just screw this mission, find a nice planet and start a colony of amateur comedians. <br><strong>Chao :</strong> I think we should line up the crew and make them listen to our jokes.

I had 1 AP and I knew thta mushes could transfer into me or contanimate right before cycle change so I wouldn't be able to delete that offer. They were only several minutes when I had more 1 AP in that cycle, it was an excellent play by mush. I'm kind of curious if they knew I that I gained AP from ration or did they just transfer randomly?</cite><p>We, the Mush, were both lucky and unlucky with the timing. I had literally just gotten out of bed IRL when I logged on, and within like 5 minutes, Gioele posted the chat where Eleesha was attacking Finola. Thankfully, I caught JS' player in pretty much the same minute and we had to make some quick decisions.</p><p>Before that, we had about 2-3 plans we wanted to proceed with, two of which involved converting Finola first, since she was very active and also a threat with research advancement <em>(bigger threat since Chun was not that active)</em>. Active, torturing Chao was making things tricky, though! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/omg.png" alt=":omg:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>With the attacks, I checked out the trades available, saw Pilgred was there, and we pretty much decided to go for it immediately, because ships with griefers <em>(and TWO of them in this case)</em> are generally meh. Not only does it ruin the fun for one side, it ruins it for both sides, even if it gave Mush the win this time.</p><p>The timing was <strong>very</strong> lucky. I saw Paola leave Bridge and someone go to Refectory. I assumed she went to help in Lab where the griefing was happening, picked my first few Mush skills, hid my trackie just in case, ran into FC and extracted two spores <em>(Roland walked in on the second extraction, but he must not have noticed the message)</em>. I then ran into Lab where everybody was, spiked Paola in plain sight and transferred into her. Ran back to Bridge and accepted the trade, and gave JS the go to come move us.</p><p>Both me and JS' player felt it was something of a meh outcome, but a win is a win, and at that point we were just a bit tired of the griefers.</p><p>That said, it was an amazing ship, RP-wise! Would totally do again, sans griefing! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>Cheers,<br>Granny <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/frieda_bergmann.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FB:" class="tid_ico"> <em>Having just misplaced her spectacles <strong>again</strong>.</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Pliman - to co powiedzieli jest prawdą. Jin Su nie trzymał fartucha. Fartuch był przez cały czas w przednim korytarzu (obok labolatorium). Dlatego uznaliśmy że nie masz podstaw aby zabijać Jin Su. Tak - miałeś rację. Jin Su był Grzybkiem, ale aż do samego końca nie zrobił niczego podejrzanego. Zaczął dopiero gdy zostałam zabita.</p><p>Teraz uznałeś swój błąd - przeprosiłeś. Cieszę sie to widząc. Teraz gdy rozumiem dokładnie o co chodzi to nie uważam Ciebie za Griefera. W tej całej sytuacji najgorsze jest to że była bariera komunikacyjna. Po prostu nie znałeś języka na tyle dobrze aby się dogadać. Dobrze Ci radzę, abyś nie bał się próbować.

Apron was all that time in Front Corridor (just next to Lab). That is why we decided that You didn't had reasons to kill Jin Su. Yes - You had right. Jin Su was Mush, but untill very end He didn't done anything Mushy. He started only after my death.</p><p>Now You accepted Your mistake - and apologised. I am glad to hear that. Now I do understand whay did You acted like You did - and honestly I do not think anymore that You are griefer. In all this situation worst part was that we could not really understand each other properly. You just don't know English well eoungh. I honestly advice You to not be affraid to try communicate though. Use Google-Translator if You must! That is better than nothing after all.</p><p>And remeber - feeling and expirience alone do not count as reason to kill somebody.

It's not like "oh, he says HELLO instead of HI, all my mushes did the same, I just feel he is also mush!". You should have some logical explanation for your actions.

                <p>Pliman, I know that rational arguments don't convince some people. Even if you prove you're right, they'll mix their emotions, feelings with arguments and make stereotypes, just once say and they'll have convinced themselves that it's enough and people follow this easy words. Once I told mass of arguments longer than 3 pages of the size of chat you see in the game, how useless Antispore Gas. Over a dozen arguments got beaten by "But Antispore Gas is always done first" and "Antispore Gas got already started so it's a waste if we don't finish it" when it was about 18% of advance.</p><p>Then you must be canning and sometimes lie if you suppose it's needed to reach your aim. Don't worry, it's a game, where you have to survive, and lead your team to win, even if you're human and you don't see anything but using these disgraceful measures. Once I showed them a link of example where just Antispore Gas was done and Mush got in 3 days 2 Betas. I lied that Antispore Gas was made pre-selection but I didn't expect anyone smart to notice this, they bought it and made another more useful research.</p><p>But if you lie, your lie should be careful and it mustn't be possible to get discovered in the time before you reach your aim. After you reach your aim, you should admit if it hurts your team when still hidden. Once I had a ship where I was Mush Paola and tried to convince Raluca to kill Jin Su who was killing his crew aboard and suspect them as Mush. Raluca said I was tough and tried to kill me. After she failed, she fabricated logs and told in public that it was me who attacked Raluca. WRONG! Your lie mustn't be possible to get discovered before you reach your aim. Of course Raluca got killed first and it created the next chaos which made human team lose the game for themselves.</p><p>You must be careful, remember. Once got a ship where Stephen was so helpful in research but quiet. He was staying in the Lab with no camera. Once Hua got to Lab, MycoAlarm rang and Hua got killed later. Then Stephen went to Alpha Dorm. Logs got cleared in the time nobody was online, suddenly somebody noticed. Eleesha was so helpful and was sharing some reports with her Tracker skill, but she was pretty suspicious for me. Suddenly Stephen transfers into Janice and mutates without killing anyone. Got killed. People thought they were Mush free. You get some rational arguments that Stephen was for sure Beta, but people believed Eleesha's claim about being Mush free. They even threaten you that they'd kill you if you touch Eleesha. Imagine you got no access to any weapon or other stuff and can't kill Eleesha alone. Tell people that you saw 3rd Mush in comrade bar but somebody picked Anonymush. They'd get a Knife and rush for Eleesha killing her even you don't have to make your hands dirty. Anonymush is the easiest to buy if you try to convince some people. But be careful, something might go wrong and you'd die first and you won't be able to tell people that you lied after they take care of Anonymush... otherwise they'd search for 4th one and won't return to Sol if they don't find the 4th. Put a note in your inventory about the truth in case you die you drop the note and they may read... unless the Mush gets it... well... that's how the strategy of the game is built.</p><p>But don't lie every time. If you find some other way than rational arguments and it isn't lying, do it. Some people will follow you if you say "Chun, I am the only morale support on this ship, give me the Knife and I'll kill her. If don't, I'll try to kill her by punching yet I am alive and it'll be a problem if I fail."</p><p>So Pliman, think about what you did wrong cheating people that commander hold the Apron and try to play better in the future, for the win of your team, as long as it's possible. Your gold language might be a key to victory and is useful for both teams.</p>

Eleesha tried to kill JS. She failed and we had a big discussion about that (she spoke to us and tried to explain herself). We all agreed that JS can keep the armor and that no one should kill anyone without a discussion. She said, she's sorry and that would never happen again.<br>2. Next day, Stephen woke up, after the whole day sleep, took a knife and tried to kill JS again. Gioele reacted quickly, telling us this, JS managed to escape in a patrolled with no tongue, we spoke again. We had a little secret chat where we tried to understand if Stevie is mush or griefer. After some discussion, we decided to kill him. He was human.<br>3. Some time later, Eleesha succeeded in Finola's assassination. She was a proven human by then (double ate) and she wrote <em>FOR DELZOUP</em> under Finola's death message. Paola reported her instantly and wrote Mods. As far as I know, they took care of her, she was harmless. At least that's what Paola said.</p><p>Also, I'd like to add that both Stephen and especially Eleesha didn't really talk to us before or after these incidents.</p>
