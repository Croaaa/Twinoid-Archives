                <p>Second Alpha Mush Roland reporting in. Was hoping there would be an AP thread for this. Alas, it's a shame I didnt make it to the end or else I would have gotten <strong>first</strong> in the glory game. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Either way, it was the most fun I had playing as the mush by far. Having said that I did make a few mistakes (missing my first chance to convert Raluca is probably the worst of maybe 3-4 big mistakes) which would have been spotted by a more active ship and have gotten me killed very early. Still though I've never been on a ship as human or mush that had 5 mush on board at one point. I especially like how we coordinated the spikings of Raluca and Janice (who I regret converting) all while selecting anonymush so nobody would notice. It was all timed to perfection!</p><p>Speaking of Janice, am I the only one who is ticked off and thinks that what Janice did was borderline reportable for playing against her team? I was already dead at the time, but I noticed Janice attacked Kuan Ti to help the humans kill him, wasting her own AP which could have been used for the benefit of the mush. I should have known something was up when in the beginning she attacked and killed a human when she was still human on the basis of just being dirty. For someone who claimed at the beginning of the ship that she knew what she was doing, and called me out, the ships comedian for making a joke... well I think you have a lot more to learn about this game.</p>

                <p>Hello Gioele reporting in!</p><p>Well I have to say that the ship was pretty frustrating but not unfun. I would like to set the record straight and say that Hua despite posting didn't seem to do ANYTHING on the ship after her 'return'. Also Ian only help with research once and maybe watered a plant once too. The research was pushed soloy by me and Chun when she was on or hadn't used her AP on something else and it showed. I have to say that you guys did a great job infecting the ship without notice until the end. I really dropped the ball by not picking up the hacker kit, but I figured we could just wipe out the mush before you could do anything. At the time I logged on Roland was already dead, Kuan Ti was hurt, and I already knew I was going to try to kill Raluca as well. I really didn't suspect you Eleesha which was very good mush play. I actually had figured that Roland and Raluca were the Alpha mush. Could you post the events for the mush over the course of the game I am quite curious.</p><p><cite>Speaking of Janice, am I the only one who is ticked off and thinks that what Janice did was borderline reportable for playing against her team?</cite> I think Janice was pretty aware of what she was doing the entire game. I remember she claimed to have played many ships which I am willing to actually believe. Her grammar changed a day into the voyage through the game and so did her 'knowledge' of the game. I feel once everyone has finalized the game ending we will see that she is just using a throw away account for griefing. I can't really understand her actions and messages otherwise.</p>

                <p>Yeah. Janice's actions were really strange. AFter Mush Selection(she wasn't even Alpha) her decisions became ignorant and questionable.

                <p>OK, let me see how well I could sum it up.<br>It started with the idea to trap the nexus and then double spike Kuan Ti under the guise of a relay. Eleesha trapped the nexus and effectively spiked Kuan Ti, but because i was at work, I missed the chance to hit him the 3rd time before he left the nexus.<br>After a failed attempt to get him to relay again with me, we resorted to trapping the nexus in the hope that he goes and works on it unprovoked. The problem with that was that Terrence and Raluca each touched the nexus, and in turn got a spore before Kuan Ti. The one time he actually goes to the nexus, it was not trapped. Again, I missed him by seconds. I refereshed the page and saw he left the room, so I quick tried to follow him to the Nexus, but ny the time I got there, he was already back in bed. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br>We did trap the nexus again and he did in fact touch it and was then converted to Mush though. Eleesha just happened to be online at the time, so she selected Anonymush at the time of conversion.<br>Before that though, I had the idea of rushing to the engine room and hitting Raluca toward the end of cycle 8, waiting a few seconds for cycle change and then sporing her again at the beginning of cycle 1. It turned out to be and epic fail though because when I got to the engine room, it wouldn't let me spore Raluca. I still dont know why, there was time left on the click before cycle change. Anyone paying attention to the room logs at that point could have called me out and gotten me killed, so I got lucky there.<br>So at this point we have Mush Kuan Ti and Terrence/Raluca with 1 spore each.<br>Up to this point, we had an advantage because the Antispore gas was really show in getting researched, so we were able to extract 4 spores/day. Shortly before the Kuan conversion the gas was complete which then limited our spore production.<br>So Kuan Ti had 2 spores, I had 1 and Eleesha had none.<br>The original plan was to just go and convert Raluca toward the end of the day/beginning of the next day in a rush like what I failed to do on my own. A little bit before the plan though, Janice came down there when Raluca was complaiing about Morale. That forced an immediate change of plan. the 3 of us worked together to come up with the winning idea. <br>Similar to what I tried on my own, toward the end of cycle 8, Myself and Kuan Ti went down and gave Janice and Raluca a quick sporing. I hit Raluca and Kuan got Janice. At the switch to the next day, Kuan got Raluca with her 3rd spore, and quickly selected Anonymush. I exracted a spore and got janice for spore #2 on her. Then Eleesha worked her way down the ship, extracted a spore, and converted Janice, giving me a few seconds advance notice so I could select Anonymush and time it perfectly.</p><p>So there we have it, a sucessful conversion of 3 people to mush, only found out by Terrence randomly taking a trip to the engine room and seeing myself and Kuan where we didnt really belong, also kinda making it obvious that Raluca was involved as well. A more active ship never would have allowed what happened to actually happen, but it was pretty damn fun. The only dissapointment was that I didnt get first place in the glory. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Did I miss out on any details?</p>
