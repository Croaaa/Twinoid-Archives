Worked like a charm)</span></span><strong>D21</strong> Stephen, Janice, Jin Su, Eleesha, Raluca, Terrence<br>Our final 6 to Eden! I was really stunned we survived for 10 days with only 6 people, after 10 people died. I glad we refused to give up and continued our journey with such a skeleton crew. Causing greatest problems was the lack of skills ( we had no biologists after Andie died, no botanists, no astros ). We made it work with <span class="tid_strike">slave labor</span> drones and healthsheet management. We couldn't have done it without your high activity, good job crew!</p><p><strong>D2: </strong> Lai Kuan-Ti <span class="tid_sideNote"> Assassinated by a crewmate!<br>«O-O i did Nothing... you were Lucky this time»</span> Sorry, about that. I couldn't tell you exactly what happen because we don't want to let your partner knowing to avoid it. You melted in the shower, plain and simple. HP was checked for the entire crew pre-selection. When I noticed you were lacking, I checked your actions and saw nothing that would have caused random damage, leaving the only explanation the shower</p><p><strong>D3:</strong> Derek Hogan <span class="tid_sideNote"> Assassinated by a crewmate!<br>«Are you fucking kidding me... I know I delayed the inac tag, but that's no reason to kill, I was logging on later in the day to actually play... wtf»</span>Yup, you were logging in while idling and we knew. Perhaps if you said something like an excuse when you logged in, we would have left you alone. As it stood, you gave us no reason to keep you around even if you were human ( Jin Su hated them xp farmers, not that you are, you just did a great job enraging people by looking like one ). <strong>Most importantly</strong>, we don't want Dereks with full AP bars lying around for any mush to transfer into. Those things can do massive damage.</p><p><strong>D3-? </strong> Hua, Frieda, Gioele, Chun, Ian<br>Idlers, and people who became idle mid-way. Meh</p><p><strong>D10: </strong>Roland and Andie <br><a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/4tFG0w/667">Became crispy in freak RNG vengeance</a>. <span class="tid_sideNote">Andie Graham<br> You've burnt yourself to a crisp<br>«Great ship! Unfortunately I won't see Eden with you guys ... »</span>Andie, you were great. Active Andies are a rare thing and you did your job well. Having 2 diplomats on every expedition was FUN!! <span class="tid_sideNote">Roland Zuccali<br> You've burnt yourself to a crisp<br>«Crappy ship. Lousy shipmates. Happy I'm dead.»</span>Likewise, Roland. This "crappy ship" didn't need you slowing down the expeditions everytime you decided to take the lens and idle outside even after everyone made a fuss of losing the Magnetic Net project. If D21 to Eden is a "crappy ship", I'd like to see what a good ship is. A D5 destruction so Roland gets a golden supernova? Sorry that it did't happen</p><p><strong>D12? </strong>Paola <br>... put an end to it all <span class="tid_strike">after emotional abuse. (How <em>could</em> you Stephen?)</span>. You did great for your first game though reporting morale more often is something that you could work on. Thanks for all the NERON updates ( all the way to <strong>v9.00</strong>! )</p>

We decided to give it a shot because giving up is uncool. <br>When we found the third starmap fragment we decided that it's not enough to just reach Eden, we needed a real challenge to make it the most satisfying trip ever <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The main reason why this trip was so successful is that I copied the <strong>Caffeine junkie</strong> skill from the inactive Gioele and read the <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_eng.png" alt=":mush_eng:" class="tid_ico"> magebook. In combination with my <strong>Creative</strong> skill I was having &gt;50 AP per day, so me and Terrence were able to deal with pretty much <em>everything</em> by ourselves.</p><p>I was focusing on healing people, putting out fires and fixing hard to repair things like Gravity Simulator while Terrence was fixing oxygen tanks, doors and other things that have 99% with both tools.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"> Fighting fires was the most challenging thing on our ship, because we didn't have the Fire Detector. We lost it in the Nexus selection when it came with Plasma Shield.<br> After D15, we were having up to 6 fires at a cycle and usually we were unable to locate all of them so we had no choice but to ignore them and let them spread. We were trying to use the Anomaly Detector to check if anything was broken by fire, but most of the times it wasn't helpful at all.</p><br><p><cite>Explain some (or all?) of your strategies to deal with pilot drones and no net, especially with them later high-count hunter waves? Paranoidly running through the bays to whisk them off to the far reaches of the ship, or what?</cite></p><p>The strategy was simple: move the ship only if the drones are onboard.</p><p>We were down to 6 people so we didn't have any AP to scan planets anyways. And trying to run away from the hunters is futile because they catch up with the ship eventually, which was proven on this ship multiple times.</p><p>When the wave of 40 hunters spawned on D16:</p><p>Jin Su killed 8 hunters<br>Terrence killed 10 hunters<br>I decided to take off with my Creative + Shooter skills and killed 9 hunters as well <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Then we dropped 3 drones in the bays to deal with the rest. They killed about ~25 hunters by themselves, we didn't do anything at all. Not a single AP spent, and our Plasma Shield was always higher than 80%. A few times their patrol crafts broke, but they managed to fix them in space.</p>
