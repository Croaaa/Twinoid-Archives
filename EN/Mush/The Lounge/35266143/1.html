Before the departure i bought a brand new trycycle from one guy, so i was ready to ride through the corridors of the Daedalus. Crew was quite active on the first day - lot's of info, we even scanned a crystalite planet. But all the info was useless after i realized, that something is different - yeah i was alpha mush. 1 hour later i got in contact with another alpha - Stephen our main plan was to convert Jin or Chao (they were most active on ship) in mush, so we could roll out. <br>Day 2: The main fail of the day 2 was that i missed a possible infection, so we could convert JS faster. Stephen stole camera so for 2 days there were no camera in Bravo Dorm. Our main problem was Chao, because he was so paranoid - checking dirty status asking why people are moving etc. He managed to find another camera and installed in Bravo Dorm, which led us to forget about JS contamination Plan. <br>Day 3: Crew was quite active on projects and research. The did conterspore serum, so it slow a bit our progression, but we managed to convert Ian (i took anonymush, so crew thought that there were 2 mush onboard.) Chao's paranoia level increased to almost max level - he asking about every moment. Bad thing - he suspected Ian, and Research Team finished Nathamy Rifle. We almost got it first to shoot chao, but somehow he managed to grabbed it first.<br>Day 4: Since Chao got rifle with his paranoia lvl - it was obvious he wanted to try it on Ian or other crew. Since Ian would probably be his first target me and Stephen andviced him to move to bravo dorm so we could cover him. Meanwhile, crew went to expo and we got JS converted, so we could leave them, but JS was offline, so Stephen made a ballsy move to kill Chao. <br>Day 5: For 3 cycles - crew hasn't noticed that Chao was killed - that gave us time to regroup and think about our strategy. Eleesha went mad because she saw Stephen's name in the LIST. But it was Day 5, so there were more that 1 name in list. Which was our main cover. Janice belived her and started attacking Stephen but Ian was in the same room + plus our chef got armor and hard boil -&gt; max 1 dmg. He also got Phagocyte, so he could outheal all dmg. Once i went to Engine room i saw, that PILGRED was at 45% - so we could rush it. That was our main goal to do on day 6. Eleesha went mad and asked to kill her, so Stephen went for some kills (KT, Janice, Eleesha). <br>Day 6: Not much to talk about. We managed to save Stephen and finished the PILGRED.</p><p>It was a fun ship and strong crew to fight against. If every went smoother - we could we early. Special props to Stephen, Ian and Jin Su. We were an amazing crew! Hope to fight along next time! And Chao - you were good, but too paranoid.</p><p>See you guys next time.<br>Terrence, out.</p>

And i did suspect Stephen quite early. never would have guesed you got Jin Su. specially after he got myco scanned.</p><p>Then again, i started to get Eleesha and Janice on my suspect list.

                <p>Wow this ship had so much potential at the start, I really thought we were going to go far. Frieda started us out with a few great planets and some crystalite options. Through the whole trip she was the one I trusted most. The rest of the crew seemed to be highly active from my view, things were getting researched and projects finished even though Plasma Shield remained elusive. On day 3 we had completed the mycoscan and found I had one spore which was going to be easy enough to remove with the soap on day 4. I had never saw that much anti-mush research on a ship before so was incredibly surprised to come back on day 4 and see my self turned mush.</p><p>How did no one notice they swarmed me on the bridge? I thought for sure Eleesha would come to the bridge and figure it out somehow, but she stayed in the lab forever it seemed like. We also planned to leave the expo team stranded but I couldn't make it back from work in time and the other mush killed Chao instead. This dropped almost all of the weapons into mush hands, infact I think it was all of them. Stephen was now armed and with Ian's protection basically just an AP sponge for the crew to beat on, quite scary. Frieda who had been helpful the entire time now confided in me that she only had 3 morale and knowing how important she was to their survival decided to finish her off. It pained me to do it but that was quickly replaced with worry when I noticed she didn't die right away and would in fact only suicide at cycle change, 15 minutes away. I thought for sure she would come back online and report my treachery but it didn't happen.</p><p>Then Eleesha held onto the list instead of just leaving it on the bridge causing the right amount of chaos and mistrust to seal the ship's fate. I pretty much just hung out on the bridge after this. People stopped working together and doing their jobs long enough for Terrence and them to repair Pilgred with a jump back to Sol with only 4 armor left. That was a great relay you guys did at the end, wasn't sure we were going to make it.</p><p>In a few days I'll post a video of the session I recorded.</p>
