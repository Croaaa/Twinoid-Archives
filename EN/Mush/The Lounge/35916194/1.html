                <p>Ladies and gentleman, gather up, pull up a chair and grab a drink, for I have a tale for you... A tale of woe, of adventure, of romance, betrayal and redemption... A tale of MUSH. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/finola.png" alt=":mush_finola_50:" class="tid_ico">Waking up in this strange ship, I knew things wouldn't be easy. I was far from Earth, too late to fight against the MUSH invasion, too far to be of any use to the resistance. The ship's log told me that even here we were not free of the invasion, some spores had been detected on board. I was still dazzled by cryosleep and the room was getting rapidly crowded by the rest of the crew waking up. I knew I had to act fast, for in those close quarters the infection would be quick to spread. I went straight for the only person I recognized and knew I could trust, the survivor of the Tamina incident, Zhong Chun. She didn't have the most brilliant record as a nurse, but at that point I would take any help I could get. Apparently cryosleep had affected her more then it had me, she was barely able to hold a conversation, much less help me with my plan. I felt impatient, but knew that it wouldn't help me in the least, so I took a deep breath and concentrated on a new course of action.</em></p><p><em>Checking the logs again, I found out everyone who had at least a small background in biology or who I thought would be disciplined enough to be a lab assistant. Decided to bring in Ian Soulton, our resident botanist and the biggest authority on MUSH in this side of the galaxy; And Paola Rinaldo, our radio operator. After gathering everyone up I went back to trying to get Chun's cooperation. Ian had it worst than her and just gazed nonchalantly at the empty air whenever we let go of him, but Paola's quick wit and expert communication skills were invaluable on calming up Chun and getting her reacquainted with her surroundings. I explained my initial idea and after some modifications on her part, we were ready to move. Chun got a vial of Frieda's perfume while I worked on rerouting access to the ship's ventilation shaft and the Daedalus was soon flooded by a vanilla-flavoured gas. It wasn't a perfect solution but it gave us a little breathing space: An unknown particle in the vanilla played wreck with the MUSH's reproductive system, making it so that only about half of the produced spores could mature. <br><br>Relieved, we started working on portable alarm devices that would notice the presence of MUSH spores in individual rooms, so that we could track the crewmembers who were infected before they could do us any harm. I felt a little bad for those poor lads, for they had probably been slaved to the MUSH collective against their will and without a cure to be had the most merciful thing to do would be to pullet a bullet through their eyes... But I could not afford to keep on that line of thought, for now they were the enemy, who would not hesitate to murder or corrupt us, binding all to their precious hive-mind... <br><br>At this point, the rest of the crew were fairly active and not a minute went by where the comms were not buzzing with status reports from all around the ship. With the knowledge that at least two traitors were out there I knew I couldn't afford to let my research be sabotaged... And a hard call had to be made: To quarantine the medlab to everyone except Chun (who, as far as we could tell was immune to the MUSH's corruption). I let out the alert that everyone who tried to force their way in to the medlab would be shot on sight. As the ship's medic, that order would carry weight with everyone but the ship's captain... Who apparently thought the operation table to be a wonderful resting place! Let me tell you, he was somewhat... Eccentric. He did not so much bark orders upon the crew as he joyfully told everyone what to do, all the while never leaving his “throne”, the operation table... He preferred to direct the ship from there instead of from the bridge, but I suspect that it was because he enjoyed his time together with our dear Chun (she claimed until the end that they never did anything inappropriate, but we shall never know the truth of that...). <br><br>Meanwhile, the investigations continued. Eleesha, our main investigator, could be seem all around the ship “tracking” as she would say. T'was not my job to investigate but as the old saying “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” still held strong, I began to assiduously read the ship logs and make my own list of suspects and potential allies... Once i had awoken dirty for no apparent reason, so I knew that one of the MUSH could slime trap... Sadly, since the whole of the crew had been on the lab on the first cycle, that didn't really diminish my list of suspects... By then we finally finished making five alarms, and Chun was charged with hiding then in undisclosed locations around the ship. I kept two for myself (one for the lab and one for the medlab) and I believe one was taken to the engine room. Paola tried to use one as a bait, standing in an apparently unguarded corridor and waiting for one of the MUSH to try and spore her. Sadly they were too smart to fall prey to this ploy...<br><br>One day I woke up alarmed by a cacophonous confusion on the Alpha dorm: There were shouts and loud banging noises and before I could get there there was a ship-wide announcement that the Icarus has been launched from the bay. Apparently one of the traitors was our main pilot, Hua, who tried to murder Stephen and launched on the Icarus when her assassination attempt failed. We were discussing what to do when the whole ship rumbled and Neron announced that we had reached a new region in space! Hua had been stranded and she took a lot of valuable equipment with her (the soap, the apron and the wrench). The captain had decided to jump the ship without any input from us, knowing full well the value of the equipment we had just left behind... This did not sit well with the crew, specially when he wouldn't leave the operation table so that we could save Stephen. The lad was able to stop the bleeding with the help of his bunk-mates, but he required more serious attention then the first aid we were able to deliver without the equipment in the medlab... It is still surprising how quickly we turned to mutiny. Eleesha and Janice went in, guns blazing, and that was the end for the captain. But the logs still indicated the presence of spores on board, Jin-Su had not been one the traitors... He was just... Eccentric and somewhat incompetent?<br><br>On the next few days, I was mostly concentrating on my personal investigation. And that point my list of suspects was quite large: Janice and Terrence, for they usually walked together on unguarded corridors, and if one of then was infected the other would surely be too... Janice had also claimed to have been the target of a slime trap, which was improbable at best, besides being the one who had pulled the trigger on the captain. Raluca was also high on my list, since she spent all that time by herself... Well, I suspected pretty much everyone else to a certain degree, except for Chun and Stephen (who had come quite close to death in his struggle against Hua), but by paying attention to the logs, my list was slowly dwindling. Paola has eaten twice on the same turn, a feat that the MUSH couldn't reproduce, since they don't process food as fast as humans... Eleesha called attention to that fact, so she got my vote of trust. Shortly after she also ate twice, so I knew I could trust her. <br><br>After a particularly bad expedition (in which Janice took part), I passed by her dorm and saw that both Ian and Terrence had gotten sick, so they were cleared as humans. That was good news, since it might mean that Janice was also not a MUSH! I wanted to believe that so bad... And that was my greatest mistake. Terrence told me that she had gotten sick on the expedition and she mimicked the symptoms of a certain sickness perfectly. I decided to trust him instead of checking for myself, and that was how a MUSH was invited into our little hunting group...</em></p><p>Liking the story? Tune in tomorrow for the conclusion of the MUSH hunting phase and the beginning of the dreaded survival phase... <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p>
