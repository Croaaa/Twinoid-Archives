                <p>Here comes human victory after rather good Mush play - I've enjoyed final outcome the most of all<br> <br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4286" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4286</a></p><p>Short story:</p><p>Alpha mushes Derek and Roland managed to convert Hua at day change by pushing her out of dorm. <br>We had team of 4 confirmed humans (Ian, Janice, Terrence), with several inactives/harmful newbies <br> (Andie, Stephen). <br>Central part of mush plot was converting Terrence almost at the same time Ian was completing Natamy rifle with my help. So Roland appeared in lab within a minute after Natamy was researched, grabbed it, and mush activity breakout happened immediately<br>- Raluca was killed<br>- 3 mush completed project that was alternative to Plasma shield (pistons detector, iirc)<br>- they damaged BIOS, nexus door, and tried to kill someone else (not very successfully - I loved Hua throwing grenade at inactive Jin Su, Roland and me in RBS - she helped us killing Roland faster); Terrence was pretending human until Ian found failed attempt to clear BDorm logs with 3 mush converting him.</p><p>So, we were left with zero techs, 27% of Pilgred, and one pilot (Frieda). Have to say Frieda did quite good in the endgame, taking care of all hunters and getting scraps. Ian with frugivore skill was also ultra useful. Either were Paola, who took care of comms, and cheerful Janice who was fixing broken stuff, settling fires and cheering up everyone.</p><p>About ill luck - Eleesha died of hunger *2 cycles* before traders appreared offering PILGRED for inactive player. Need to say PILGRED was at 80%+ already</p><p>So, we did it back to sol and with serum!!! Many thanks to my favourite human team for willpower and attitude shown, and to mush team for organizing heroic circumstances for us <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> as Derek said in his last post, "you did good, but not good enough. I'm not playing checkers, but it seems to be checkmate" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Ian here, I can't believe we made it! What a voyage!</p><p>Not in terms of achievements or length clearly, but for an extraordinary amount of grit and determination showed by the human team to bring us back from the brink and pull off a win.</p><p>That last mush play was brutal. I bet you thought you had defeated us, and you nearly did! At one point we were down to 5 hull, and 30% pilgred..... It all seemed so useless and that we had no hope of fixing pilgred...</p><p>awesome game</p>

I am quite surprised you made it.<br>I thought my plan was going to work and the ship would eventually blow up. I knew I should have told Terrence to only try to dismantle that oscilloscope which I built as my excuse to get dirty and extract the two spores I used to convert Hua and Terrence. Good game humans.</p><p>I came up with quite a few ideas on what to do, a couple stealthy ideas, but we ended up deciding that turning Terrence, killing Raluca, and rushing pistons over plasma shield would be the plan for success. With no techs and one pilot, I thought you would have to keep jumping away from any potential Pilgred traders, and you would have almost no scrap. Anything beyond those three actions were meant to put you behind even further, like slimming the bios terminal. Getting through all that took some impressive teamwork and activity.</p><p>I wish more people played along with my role play of me telling great stories of adventure and being a complete airhead. I was planning on telling more of them, but I was chosen mush right as I finished my first one, so I knew I was not going to get to tell that many. Staying in character was important especially to make that "accidentally kicked out instead of flirt" plan to work properly. Thanks to those who did play along with it.<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>In a way it did help you, we knew you were a mush when you tried that move. What we didnt know was how successful you had been. Our plan was to save you because you were so entertaining, but first we needed to kill the other mush. Who we thought was some inactive (roland had us totally fooled.... though I think chun suspected him briefly). In then end that procrastination screwed us. We should have killed you, and possibly Hua who was not acting like someone who was potentially just spiked.</p>

                <p>Yes I thought so, and I did have a plan for if you did come after me, and I was quite surprised when you didn't come to kill me. I had plans irl on day 3, so I didn't suggest anything to Roland and Hua, and seeing as how all the plans we did were pretty much my ideas, they didn't do much except extract spores.</p><p>Terrence suspected Roland, although from what he told us, everyone else didn't share that suspicion.</p><p>I enjoyed making those stories. I knew from the beginning that killing me and my storytelling would be a downer for the whole ship. I'm glad people enjoyed my stories enough to not kill me. That just shows how powerful role playing can be.</p>

I felt something was up from past experience, as Roland is my favorite character. I felt that he under-performed.</p><p>This was also a good experience, since I now know how to act in the future if it seems our Mush is organized. Should have left the dorm as fast as I saw Derek enter the room, and three of our suspects was there all at once.</p><p>Anyways, kudos guys! It's a shame I had to leave so early, this was the best ship I've had this whole month.</p>

                <p>Yes, indeed it was Terrence who kept suspecting Roland from early D2, and kept telling it me in PM; my suspects were Derek (after pushing Hua, as said earlier), Terrence (until Paola printed her list) and Jin Su (I even proposed killing him first when Natamy is researched); I never played Roland, so didn't suspect him indeed.</p><p>One more - it seemed to me Jin Su lost his walkie-talkie on expo, as he stopped communicating after it, and left a note to "sell him before he starved to death", like 10 minutes before he was killed by Hua's grenade</p><p>forgot to introduce myself, though it's quite clear already - I was Chun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

No Techs, a single Pilot, no genuinely useful magebooks, just over 30 armor, no hope of a Plasma Shield, PILGRED very much still in disrepair... I thought we'd doomed you for sure.</p><p>But I digress, let's start from the beginning. I joined the game as Roland because I knew I wouldn't have a lot of real-life time, and his job is both AP-intensive yet straightforward and not time-consuming. I was pleasantly surprised that, not five minutes after I had joined (and before I even had a chance to catch up on all the radio chatter), our last crew member thawed out and I was chosen to serve Mother Mush.</p><p>I immediately bee-lined straight for Bravo Dorm, pulling two spores on the way there. And wouldn't you know it, therein lied a gold Hua, the coveted shower, and most importantly <strong>no camera</strong>. I immediately dumped a spore into her; that's what you folks overlooked, and that's what would ultimately prove to be the lynch-pin in your near-downfall. I had no bed and no AP, but I couldn't have asked for a smoother start in such an active ship.</p><p>I was kind of hoping that the camera issue would continue to be overlooked, but alas the camera was installed well before day two rolled around. By the time I recovered from my initial escapades the Antispore and Constipaspore were already finished, severely limiting us. Derek had the ridiculous idea of coordinating an "accidental" push on Hua, which ended up being so insanely ballsy we actually got away with it. He and I put the second and third spores into her right there in Bravo Bay, before the alarm was raised and the MycoAlarm was delivered to her (coincidentally only about 20 minutes before the day 3 changeover, which turned out to actually work in our favor) and Derek took Anonymush so that he could try to continue blending in.</p><p>Sometime during day 3 I decided to try out Green Jelly for the first time, knowing it was bugged to be completely private. I really wanted to spore Terrence at least once, so I slimed the camera. I was advised that it would be too suspicious, though, so I let it break and be repaired without acting on it.</p><p>By the time day four rolled around I was feeling a bit boxed in and out of options, and Hua and I were ready to act on Terrence and Raluca. But as luck would have it Derek tuned in only ten minutes before I would have started without him. With all three of us working together we just dumped one spore each into Terrence, converting him almost instantly (he actually managed to clear the dorm in the same instance we converted him, <strong>almost</strong> ruining everything). Hua tried to clear the logs, but it turns out Defacer is kind of a crap skill and doesn't immediately erase anything.</p><p>From there it was like living in a dream. We knew our next target was Raluca, and that it was now or never. I Sprinted up to the lab, intent on stealing the Blaster that was being researched. You would not believe the manic grin I had on my face when I arrived mere seconds after the Natamy had been completed (I had no idea you were even close to finishing it, seriously, the timing was brilliantly surreal); I grabbed that right out from under you, and then for good measure I also stole the armor which Chun had presumably dropped to in favor of the apron. Then I ran to the Nexus, emptied the Natamy into Raluca, then Derek and I beat her to death. I slimed the NERON Terminal without thinking just because I could, then went to a rear storage, where I completely ran out of action and movement points. For me, everything had worked out near-flawlessly, and I was genuinely happy for a job-well-done. I believe Hua came behind me, slimed the BIOS and Doorman'd the door. By the time I came back from a real-life shower about fifteen minutes later, the initial slaughter was already over. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Excellent ship all-around, very tight-knit crew on both sides with most everyone playing their parts to a 'T'. Congratulations to the Human team for such a gritty success; I genuinely thought we were guaranteed a postmortem victory.</p><p>10/10 would Mush again.</p>

                <p>Frieda here. Normally a bronze Frieda like myself would just be a planet scanner. For some reason I chose Pilot and this turned out to be a key decision in the entire game. Up to the time the Mush went into full attack mode I had not done very much and in fact my timing was that I came down to launch and expo that ended up having both Derek and Terrence on it AFTER they had become Mush! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> During the expo nobody sustained any damage except Derek lost his tracker. However, I saw that Derek was at 6 health and Terry was at 15. Ian clued me into what was going on and guarded the Rear Corridor and provided me with a blaster when I got back. I killed Derek within two minutes of returning from the expo. Later on a few cycles later I got the pleasure of finishing off Terrence with two blaster shots and a slap upside his head after Janice and Chun had "softened" him up a bit. Don't mess with Grandma boys! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Now we took stock of where we were. Remaining crew all human at that point were Chun, Janice, Eleesha, Paola, Ian, Gioele, and myself. Seven humans left with virtually no progress on Pilgred and a hull that looked like swiss cheese. Anyway we all pulled together and somehow we managed to fight off hunters, complete Pilgred, do the retroserum and make it home and only lost Eleesha (inactive) before we pulled it off. Plus I ended up as the player with most glory. Thanks to everyone who made that possible and especially to Chun and Ian! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>current cycle and everything before it, even Eleesha cant see through. After it`s work nothing unusual is in logs except you cant see records as if roomlog wasn`t started before cycle next to defacer. But at cycle defacer used all logs are still there and there`s a message "the logs were scrambled" hovering on top of roomlog.</p>

                <p>Closer to the second then; it's cleared but somebody that was in the room is definitely a mush, so it's as much of a give away as a sporing message. Thank you!</p>
