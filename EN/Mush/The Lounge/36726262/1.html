First time trying her, it is pretty silly that I can do a day 2 Pilgred on silver. Although I would bet my life on it that with someone to relay all the time and maybe a ration, day 1 Sol is possible before the mush are assigned. That would be retarded. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway! I want to state two things. EFF YOU RNGJESUS! Or praise you in this case. Last MMM ship we did daily expos until day 20+ or so, to find one star map. Here we found all three in like... 4 expos or so? It's so luck based it's unfunny, but hey, we could have done the earliest Eden return on late day 8.</p><p>Hence comes the topic name. It's good to see Hua attacking Janice even on the endgame page. I swear those two were more of a threat than the mush.<br><em>BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN WE HAD TWO MUSH DIE IN 24 HOURS.</em><br> I do not agree with Hua on blaming her for the lack of enthusiasm, it was mainly the ship'S fault, although a self generated one probably.</p><p>Once we found the map pieces, had 90% or researches and projects done, we were hanging around for a few days, and Janice asked: Vote on return to Eden or not.<br>This is the best way to do and I really do praise the ship for talking about it. By that I mean half of the ship since the other half had torn tongue or something, being silent even about a question as important as this. Democracy with all it's drawbacks worked, although it was lackluster.<br>Janice and Hua constantly fought, except on Jin Su where they both agreed he was a bad boy. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Apart from this...not much happened. RNGJesus loved us, since we had 4-5 cycles of no hunters (the big wave instantly cleared by our pilots), projects and researches silently done, ~5 fires altogether and I don't think anyone went below 8hp.</p><p>I have to point out that people did their jobs well. Everyone worked their posts quickly, (Jin was the only noticable slow, everyone else was silent or quickly acting), so praises to everyone on the ship! Even to those whom I think I saw...twice or so, for not starving (I'm looking at you Chao).</p><p>These things come to my mind about the ship, so be sure to tell me why I'm wrong or left out THAT CRUCIAL THING I SHOULD TOTALLY SAY.</p><p>(I could say why I found the ship "boring", or my problem with a mushless ship, but I think it's a fairly well known opinion on the forums.)</p>

                <p>Hey, Hua here.</p><p>I was originally for going on longer, but the actual reason I voted to end it sooner was exclusively because I was sick of Janice.</p><p>So as to not sound like a completely unreasonable ass, I feel its important to explain a couple of things that weren't obvious to everyone.</p><p>Whilst Stephen (our second alpha) was still alive, I was in a mush-hunt channel with Janice and Chun. Later on, when we were unsure of what to do, I typed a message, stating I wanted to give a Blaster to Chao, to both test him as a candidate for mush and to get a few shots off on our AFK Stephen.</p><p>Shortly after, Janice responded that she had hidden both the blasters in Rear Corridor, so I went and got one and told them.</p><p><strong>Janice exploded</strong>, swearing, shouting, screaming at me for ruining her hard earned work of hiding the blasters without anyone noticing, that she <em>can't fucking believe</em> that seconds after she tells me where the blasters are I go and ruin it. etc, etc, etc. I repeatidly explain calmly that I assumed her telling me where the blasters was, directly after I said I wanted one was so I could get one, but continued to insult and shout. I eventually told her I would not be spoken to like that and left the private channel, which is when you saw the spillover into the main chat.</p><p>It all turns out, that Janice <strong>didn't see my message directly before hers asking for a blaster</strong> and <strong>just happened</strong> to tell me where they were at the same time.</p><p>This, along with her repeated ranting, insulting the crew, cursing people for not being in the Icarus bay as quickly as she wanted, over-riding things other people said because she thought she knew better when she didn't.</p><p>Our D1C1 Plasma shield, and you, and Terrence and many of the others were awesome, I totally agree with you that our mush being pushovers sucks and removes a lot of the enjoyment, but for me, the biggest spoiler honestly was Janice and the reason I wanted off that ship.</p><p>Jin Su was actually more active than lead to believe (he moved the ship every time we asked, moved us out of orbit every time too), he just stopped typing in the main chat as he was also sick of Janice.</p><p>I'd like to add that I am sorry for the couple of rough responses I did give in chat directed at Janice and if I too contributed to the bad atmosphere, she really was ticking me off constantly <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Frieda here!</p><p>Sorry i was nearly silent during the Eden discussion but our insane luck was one of the things that made me feel pretty ambivalent about the whole game. Mush hunting challenge ? Nah, mushes out themselves or do nothing. Eden challenge ? Nah, RNG just gives it away with a pat on the back. Having no clear goal to strive for made me lean for Eden return but didn't want to spoil the fun for people who enjoy extended games.</p><p>And even if we had our squabbles the ship efficiency was pretty scary sometimes.</p>

We had a lot going for us alright but ship actions were beginning to get slow and they were going to get even slower since no one wanted to use Gioele's IRC. And thanks for showing me Ctrl+W, Gioele! It's pretty nifty.</p><p>I'm sorry to those who wanted to go on, I could have used a Day 20 distinction too but I didn't like the direction our ship was going. It's like biting into the most delicious apple in the world then leaving it on the park table outside for a few hours then coming back to finish it.</p><p>We did have a pretty Ace pilot team though, would have had another if Eleesha didn't read the piloting book. What's up with her end message, anyway? Anyone actually believe it? I wasn't a part of the mush hunt so Hua or Jin Su would probably know.</p><p>My new ship's still filling up, hope to see some of you there!..although there is a griefer on board so watch your step :/</p>

                <p>Kraxon, I almost asked who you were but Hua answered it. I did not had anything against you, but the only thing I saw was the expo being slow, people standing around, Janice saying we should go now, but it seems we were always short of someone.</p><p>I'll give credit to Janice that she really did think of using everyone to maximum efficency, which is good, but I only saw her side of the things since most people were silent, even you.<br>It was pretty...weird as usually I know almost everything happening in a ship. Being Raluca on a silent but working ship made me lose touch with what was happening, especially since I didn't do much just stood around and fixed/dumped AP into something.</p>

                <p>Oh, I didn't expect there to be an AP thread for this ship, seeing as people seemed so disapointed in it and it was a short ride. I was Gioele.</p><p>I have to say I'm disappointed in some of people on this ship, squabling like kids. Unless you are kids, then I guess it's okay? <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/oups.gif" alt=":anim_oups:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Hua, I understand that you and some others were frustrated with Janice, but I found her to be a very reasonable and entertaining discussion partner. I think if you put some effort into it, you could have put aside your differences about what ever happened in your mush hunting channel, and for a while it seemed like you did. Unfortunately it seemed like both Hua and Janice just wanted to escalate the whole matter when you got the chance. Think about what you're saying before you press that enter button! Honestly especially Janice, you're supposed to be the ship shrink and diplomat. None the less, I found it interesting to watch from the sidelines, so I guess there's that silver lining.</p><p>Whatever the outcome, I had a blast on the ship, so I hope you can all put your negative emotions aside and look back at the long discussions on game mechanics, our silly RP stuff and everything else that went on on the ship in a positive light. And hopefully our next MMM (if they still continue after castings hopefully come soon) will be a bit less lucky. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/keepcool.png" alt=":K" class="tid_ico"></p>

I'm just the one who blew up at you two for all your bossiness and mistakes.</p><p>Eden wasn't earned, we fell into it after just 4 expos. When I said "most of the crew" what I really meant was most of the voters, who were actually a minority. Raluca was the only one of you that I respected at all for her opinion. So it was really just a few of the crew that were whiny quitters and everyone else didn't want to keep pushing so hard just to get you to move on.</p><p>I'm not going to bother playing your game of listing out each individual incident and my point of view on it.
