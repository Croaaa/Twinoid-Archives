                <p>I was Janice. Eleesha and me were the alphas. Kuan Ti was converted at the end of the second day. Chao was converted as a distraction when we attacked the bridge, but we were pleasantly surprised when he came online soon after. The funniest thing is that for how little Chao talked as a human the trip he was totally active in mush chat. We had a lot of fun during those few cycles after the attack.</p><p>The shower checking made us on edge but in the end it was actually pretty easy to get around. I took showerproof, but we all just showered quickly and without soap so no one saw us dirty or shower. If we got publicly dirty we would coordinate with each other to fake the health check.</p><p>I was bummed when the spore sucker testing started. Once Paola asked me to take the test I was planning to grab it and hide it and then transfer into Finola and kill the Janice body, but when we saw how little oxygen was left and that Chao (who had 1 spore already) was on the bridge we decided on an all out attack. At this point Eleesha went inactive and it was just me and Kuan Ti, so we grabbed the grenade, armor, and all the weapons and had some fun. We killed Paola, Frieda and converted Chao, then ran to the lab for Ian's pacifist protection. Chao then killed Chun.</p><p>Suffocating us to death was a smart move as that's probably the only viable option you had to kill us. We had tried to pull oxygen and sabotage the tanks, but like idiots we forgot to make room in our inventories and were confused about why we couldn't see the button to extract a capsul <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">. So Chao and I (Kuan Ti had logged for the night) decide to make a last ditch attempt to kill Roland as we were confident that he was holding at least 2 capsules. But it seemed that we were just a little bit short of the ap to accomplish it.</p><p>I gotta say Im impressed that you guys got a few expos in after we died. Any luck with oxygen? Did Eleesha ever come back online? I was pleased that from reading the chat it looked like you guys thought Kuan Ti was an alpha and that all the mush were dead. I was hoping that she would come back and cause some damage, or survive on the very small chance you repaired pilgred.</p><p>Im glad to see that from Stephen's end game note he didn't take his murder badly. I still feel that if Paola had been a little less abrasive this ship could have gone a lot farther. I felt that the arguments between Ian and Paola, and Hua and Paola went much farther than they needed to, possibly to the point of being personal, and I think it changed the whole atmosphere of the ship. Even though it benefited me as a mush I was sad to see it. With the number of actives we started with I expected this ship to go a lot farther and was looking forward to trying to play a long game as mush. Sad that it didn't work out that way.</p><p>Hua, sorry for bringing suspicion on you for moving the soap to the lab. It was obvious to me what you were doing with it when I saw in the logs that you took the soap and left the dorm. I was just using it as an excuse to go to the lab to infect the cat, and to build some trust with Paola. When I saw how Paola wouldn't let it go, even after it was determined you just wanted to research the soap, I said to Paola that it was mostly harmless to try to defuse the situation, but it was too late. Sorry for putting you in her sights.</p><p>This was my first time as Janice and gotta say that she is awesome as mush. I had a lot of fun playing with Neron messages after the chaos started. The one that got Roland thinking Chao transferred with Jin Su put a huge grin on my face:</p><p><a href="http://gyazo.com/9d40d55c90293598b3ef591f1d6c4ccc" target="_blank">http://gyazo.com/9d40d55c90293598b3ef...</a></p><p>I was so bummed when Chun gagged me and I couldn't spare the ap to remove it for a few cycles and lost access to public chat. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>All in all I feel that everyone on this ship meant well, but it was just a clash of personalities and playstyles.</p>

The amount of suspicion and paranoia had us going crazy. We never even suspected there were more than 2 mush until somebody infected Chao.</p><p>By the way, after we managed to kill off the mush, the ship went on for a while. We placed oxygen back into the tanks, and started blindly exploring planets. Which paid off.<br>We managed to do an exploration (me and Hua) to an oxygen planet, but we missed the oxygen encounter. Hua gave up on the planet and left the icarus bay immediately afterwards, but I did a solo expedition and got us that much-needed oxygen!</p><p>The very next cycle, I was killed by falling junk.

                <p>Haha, yeah. The best that I (Roland) got out of this trip was that I finally found out how the oxygen system works. Apparently the moment it <em>hits</em> 0 someone dies, so putting that 1 oxygen back into the tank actually accomplished nothing but waste it. (Still funny how I died, of all people, after having a capsule up to that moment.)<br>Of course, if Hua had put hers back as well instead of keeping it for herself, neither me nor anyone else would have had to die. But that was just the crowning moment after a long list of selfish moves that may have earned her some glory, but caused everyone else more stress than most mush did.</p><p>Still happy that the oxygen plan worked out. After seeing you bunkered up in that lab with the conveniently inactive Ian, I also had my moment of grinning when the logs showed you all holding 3 items other than capsules.<br>Would have worked a lot better if more people were online at the time, but that is how it goes. Still happy the others still made it that far!</p>
