Most of my mind during the ship was occupied with summer projects (I don't understand why Crime and Punishment is so popular), so I don't remember most of the details aside from shooting hunters and farming jumpkins (I was Hua). As a result someone else will have to give a play-by-play.</p>

                <p>Hello <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It's Chun here. This was my first Eden ship and I really enjoyed it.</p><p>I usually don't play Chun but wanted to try to give my best. I had a SS to copy random logs etc. But actually Janice, Eleesha and Jin su did the hard work. It's not easy! You don't know who to trust, everyone PMs you. Less than a day after mush selection both O2 tanks got broken and Jin su PMed me that Eleesha was in both rooms a few cycles ago. But he didn't copy the actual logs from the rooms. (I was trying to relay Finola and didn't have much spare ap to walk around the ship) (Also I think that Green Slime doesn't work on O2 tanks). Eleesha hadn't started a PM with me. But for me it was kind of suspicious to try to blame her. On the same time - Janice was copying me logs from the dorms. "Eleesha entered and left doing nothing" - oh, cmon. But not long after this we got the right track - both Paola and Chao entered Raluca's turret and Raluca didn't say anything about it -&gt; Most likely turned. After this everything happened fast. We killed Chao and prepared to rush the serum and cure Paola. (We still weren't sure if Raluca was a mush or not). We made the serum, I went on the bridge.. Injected Paola... and... there were still 1 yellow icon in the crew bar. ?! ?!.... This was a confusion because of anonymush -&gt; Paola had lost her skills so we had to kill Raluca. After this everything seemed easy. We went to a few expeditions - Frieda got us wonderful planets! On one of the expeditions we found 2 fragments. And on the next day we had the last one. We waited a few days for day 10 and to finish all the research and that's it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> We could have stayed longed -&gt; We had tons of Jumpkins and Coffee and people were active - there was always someone to heal you when you got hit by a steel plate or something.</p><p>What I was saying is...</p><p><strong>Thank you everyone!</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Hello all, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/jinsu.png" alt=":mush_jin_su_50:" class="tid_ico"> <em>Jin Su</em> here! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><br>We managed to get to Eden because we were both superbly lucky and also we had a nicely competent &amp; communicative crew. Things that I remember about this ship:</strong></p><p>- My initial suspect was Eleesha because both O2 tanks broke in D2 or D3, and only Eleesha was in both rooms 2 cycles before they broke, so I thought it could had have been green jellied.</p><p>- But that changed quickly because Eleesha caught both Chao &amp; Paola crossing Raluca in RAT... immediately we knew who the mush were &amp; dealt with them promptly. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>- Also, the BIOS in our Nexus inconveniently broke in D2 or D3. I wonder if Raluca maybe jellied it.</p><p>- On top of that, 3 fires broke out in D2 or D3.</p><p>- Also, we went through Nexus Projects ridiculously quickly, hoping to reveal Plasma Shields... but it turned out to be the very last project to be revealed. It was around D8 and we still had no shields!</p><p><strong>You'd think that we're an unlucky ship at this point. But nope, we turned out to be an insanely lucky ship. Lemme explain why...</strong></p><p>- We barely encountered ANY hunters in the entire voyage. Any that did appear were small enough to be dealt with quickly by the active pilots. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>- That allowed us to trade all our inactives away! We had so much fuel &amp; O2 from trades that we were never worried about them. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>- Also, since Plasma Shields was the very last project to be revealed, we stopped the Nexus team and got Paola to upgrade Comms instead, unlocking the shields with only 10-12APs. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>- We also found a Jumpkin on our very first expedition. And then 3 more Jumpkins on the 2nd expedition. We had a full Jumpkin garden with Heat Lamps &amp; Extra Pots by around D8.</p><p>- Then, we found 2 map shards on our 3rd expedition, and another map shard on our 4th expedition! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> It was only D9 and we were already Eden-ready, but we decided to stay a bit for the golden ticket.</p><p>- By the time I hit the Eden button, we had 11 people alive. Not a single active on this ship died (except for the mush). Once, Paola had only 2 HP from random room events, though.</p><p><strong>So yup, insanely lucky.<br><br>There is one unlucky event that my crewmates aren't aware of: just before I hit the Eden button, I decided to try solving the Mad Kube first. I started with full APs, drank 3 coffees, ate 9 Jumpkins, and 1 ration. That's around 45 APs spent on the Mad Kube. AND I STILL DIDN'T MANAGE TO SOLVE IT! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></strong></p>
