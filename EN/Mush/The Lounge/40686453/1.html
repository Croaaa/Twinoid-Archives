This was a pretty good ship, though I think it suffered a bit because a lot of knowledgable players with important skills went inactive for various periods of time.</p><p>Raluca and I rolled Alpha mush at the start. We did a good job of trying to hide in plain sight, but the heat was on after a short amount of time. I tried to participate in research without trying to help too much. After laying low, Raluca single handedly converted Eleesha around the Day 2/Day 3 change, thanks to her level 14 skill, and she actually did this by spiking her in Alpha Dorm and then using Defacer which nobody noticed. The second use of defacer which happened later on was not so successful.</p><p>The attack on Roland by Frieda was unexpected but very nice for us mush. The green jelly got too apparent at a certain point, and with Eleesha's help we were all too eager to pin the blame on either Stephen or Andie, despite the fact that Stephen had been semi-proven earlier by him using Solid to carry the freezer (a fact that I was happy to see being overlooked).</p><p>My biggest worry throughout was that either Jin Su, Kuan Ti, or Janice would decide to take up their own mush investigations, but they didn't really do that until it was already too late. Eleesha and Raluca converted Andie, but when Raluca used defacer it seemed to bug out, possibly due to the interaction with the mycoalarm. But a lot things did get "erased" by defacer that same cycle, including Eleesha's double grenade in alpha dorm.</p><p>In the end, we lost Raluca to Jin Su, lost Andie-turned-Terrence due to oxygen loss, and when the last human Hua died, Eleesha and I were eliminated by NERON. We did strongly consider a PILGRED hijack to Sol, but after Raluca died that was not a strong option.</p><p>All in all, I had fun. Special Shout outs go to Jin Su, Paola, and Hua for keeping chat fun and interesting.</p>

I was just like WTF, I WAS DOING MY JOB HERE, AND NOW... CORPSES EVERYWHERE, IS DIE2NITE INVADING MUSH? Then I was invited to a conversation, and suddenly my life became depressive. Just me, Andie (after real mush-Andie transfered to Terrence, so it was Terrence) and Hua as humans. I run to get the Armor and run back to the medlab with Andie... but both were inactive when Eleesha tried to kill Andie, but I had healed him, so it was not possible. Then Terrence came and killed Andie, punched me a little, and raged Eleesha just removed all of the oxygen expecting I die on next cycle... well, that happened. I died.</p><p>But it was an awesome game, really great, and I hope playing with all of you (active people) again <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Was Janice and inactive (sorry) for first 2 days cause of connection problems.</p><p>It was an awful human play :/. I mean it was clear that Raluca is mush cause she did NOTHING at all except forcing pilgred and was active at the same time. She also didn't ask for morale - so she had to :/ - I was trying to speak with people about killing her but actually noone was bothering with that. Did I get it right that Eleesha relayed pilgred at 29% already before becoming mush? It really is hard to become a mush playing Eleesha - it means you're doing really wrong things.</p><p>And you forgot to mention 1 more thing - we had hopeless Chun and Jin without leader. My morale was so bad on day 3 that 1 needed only 1 panic attack to die so most of my AP was used to moralize myself and others. And yep, Andie sleeping in Med with no alarms... Though she saved me I suppose just before conversion with picking confident skill. Oh and Frieda :/... which didn't find a planet and decided to use AP to kill our most active pilot instead.</p><p>Glad at least some people did their work great <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>PS Forgot about morale - adding to hopeless Chun, Paola made connect before the ship was full (only about half joined) ! That is half didn't get +3 morale, then 3 people died by themselves to day 3 :/ (1 depression 2 starvations). And then when Frieda killed Roland (-1 more precious morale) I've got weapon phobia <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">, that is no chances for me to deal with Raluca <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.</p>

                <p>Yikes, I forgot that Janice got weapon phoba! And yes, unless I'm mistaken I remember that Eleesha did relay PILGRED once before becoming mush. But Raluca was able to convert her under the Alpha Dorm camera because Raluca had the level 14 skill that made her able to spike once immediately before Day change, and then two more times after day change. And then using defacer in Alpha Dorm, nobody seemed to notice the missing logs. It was really unavoidable for Eleesha to become mush, but we could have been caught if someone noticed that the logs didn't go back as far as they should have during Day 3.</p><p>But later on when Raluca used defacer again in Alpha Dorm, it bugged out, and we're pretty sure the defacer bug has something to do with the mycoalarm.</p><p>I do understand your pain though, I remember mentioning in the mush channel at one point that if I were human Ian on a ship like that, I'd probably be pulling my hair out due to lack of progress. Paola actually completed 2 NERON upgrades before we had completed a single Nexus project, which shows how much more productive Paola was than half of the crew.</p>

                <p>Hua here. was I still in the alpha dorm when defacer happened? Otherwise I probably skimmed through the logs too fast or I wasn't there to see it happen because of swapping bed with Roland.</p><p>It's easy to be intelligent in an afterthought, but the pilgrid relay did worry me abit. Eleesha went there too many times, and I was dumb enough to not be vocal about it. If I had the power to manage the crew, I'd advise them to go there once each. That alone should be enough to reach 40~50%.</p><p>In any case, the human crew was probably a lost cause anyway. GG mush team.</p>

                <p>Eleesha reporting in. I went to engine room exactly once, and relayed Pilgred exactly once. I was extremely careful as Eleesha, and as people have apparently failed to read, I was triple spored in one minute on day change in dorm under camera. There's absolutely no way to stop that, it was human failure in noting the rather obvious defacer log despite there being 5 humans in there. Any person who stopped in that cycle would see it in bright red. Anybody who stopped in the following day could notice the logs were shortened - it's again total human failure to not even notice a defacer usage in dorms. In addition, further human failure that nobody followed up on my mush hunt post that Raluca was highly suspect for lack of AP usage. And of course, human failure to not follow up on green jelly attempts, it really shouldn't have been as easy as it was to manipulate people in that as that's an absolute condition rather than a probability-based event. Also, Janice you're wholly incorrect in general that it's difficult to become mush when Eleesha - she is probably the second easiest character to turn after Raluca using social manipulation. You're also the first person I've ever heard complain that NERON was relayed a single time, which borders on the bizarre.</p><p>Anyway, I thought it was fairly inspired that after defacer bugged out I used it to secret double grenade - after killing 4 humans I was still able to maintain my innocence, which is fairly uncommon. Especially since the grenade was hidden first day by a human - fortunately I maintain full logs of everything as Eleesha.</p><p>Finally, It's actually fairly common for a competent Paola to complete two Neron upgrades before completing a single Neron research - this can be done in a single cycle after comms is established.</p>
