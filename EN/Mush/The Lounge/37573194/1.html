This thread is made cause some of us wanted to see about getting back together some time.</p><p>Anyway when we started it was alright, we got two grenade blueprints and 2 sofa blueprints. But then our otherwise inactive Chun picked them up and hid them, we found 1 but we never found the other one. Our Terrance didn't seem to speak English and Chao apparently refused to play for some reason or another.<br>Eleesha and Raluca (for the most part) was also inactive. So not as great a start as we would have first thought.<br>I spent most of the D2 watching the guys in the med lab for entries since I was resting anyway, they were vulnerable due to lack of camera so I checked in for any arrivals or dirtiness.</p><p>So round D2C6-7 Paola takes the knife and armor, kills Roland and hurt Hua, our pilots, in Beta dorm then steals our pilot book. Jin, Myself, and Ian, go to kill her, but Ian means when Finola shows up she couldn't kill Paola. I gave Finola one of the beds we were holding and went to the Medlab, Hua followed and I was going to heal her next cycle.</p><p>During this time Finola, Jin su, and myself made an anti-mush chat.</p><p>But then Kuan Ti shows up and kills Hua, then transfers into Janice and heads off to kill Chun.<br>After I confirm that there was a transfer by checking skills our anti-mush chat turns into "we are likely going to die" chat. But then Stephen shows up, kills Kuan Ti now Janice before any real damage occurs and Jin Su gains enough ap to take a shot at Paola (from her logistic skill no less <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> )</p><p>Round then we invited Janice now Kuan Ti (later named Juan Ti) and Stephen (our new Comms Girl, refused to wear the outfit) and it turned into a spam chat. That was real fun, Stephen even had a random number game in which Finola won 2 MPs.</p><p>Jin Su takes the pilot and Gioele reads the book Paola didn't manage to read. We also got a tech book which Juan Ti read.</p><p>Anyway D3 I found a planet, Jin arranged a speech at C8s (plus an actual speech) in the labs to keep Chun and everyone else alive. Then hunters showed up. We were leaving when I brought up my planet and they went sure why not.</p><p>The planet wasn't bad per say, it had a chance at Food, o2 and some other alright stuff, but had like four zones where we could lose someone, and lose someone we did. Jin Su. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Jin Su, Stephen, Silent Terrance, and Finola went on the mission.<br>We lost Stephen briefly but he showed up before they went back. I should have never mentioned that planet and just loaded the 1 fuel.</p><p>We were really lost then, Chun was going to die by D5C1 and with her a fair mount of the group would follow throughout the cycles. Spam/Fun chat had most of the active ship in by then.</p><p>So we rushed the Pilgred with Juan Ti. But we hit 99% by D4C7 with 20 hunters on us, I needed one cycle to finish it off and Finola didn't manage to hack the command terminal. Gioele wasn't online to move us to buy more time.</p><p>So when we were about to die who showed up but Raluca, she finished the Pilgred and hacked the command terminal, taking us home. That for me made up for all the inactivity up til then.</p><p>It was a cool ship, not bad for your first, eh Finola? Mush plan was good if a bit premature, could have done more damage if they had waited, but then I wouldn't have had so much fun. So like I said, some of us wanted to find the rest to maybe arrange to do a ship again sometime, maybe in May.</p><p>Starting to dislike writing ap threads though, hard to remember everything in a ship this talkative.</p>

                <p>Finola here~! It was really fun and I really loved playing with you, guys! We got through so many near-death situations and made amazing comebacks by not giving up! Stephen and Raluca were the heroes of the day, saving us both in the most dangerous situations. Jin Su and his leadership will also never been forgotten! All his efforts...haven't been gone to waste!</p>

                <p>Here we go <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Jin Su here and I loved this round.</p><p><strong><em>Day 1</em></strong></p><p>I chose Jin Su just to fill up a random ship. I never commanded anything nor am I good at Mush hunting. From my perspective: I suck <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>I arrived on my new ship and there was alot of chatter going on already. I was so happy that someone took Initiative and that noone relies on me. I even posted that I may be the commander, but *not in command*.<br>Roland and Hua did a great job, handled things like professionals and everything was as chilled as can be. I chatted a bit with Frieda (can't remember about what) but we even had codewords *Jack* and..I don't remember hers..in case transfers would happen.</p><p><strong><em>Day 2 (or was it still 1?) The mush masterplan</em></strong><br> <br>Out of a sudden we get the death message about Roland. I was on time so I rushed to A Dorms, but stuff happened in B Dorm. I informed Frieda and we rushed to Bravo where we found Paola. All I read was: Roland down, Hua wounded..they were after our pilots and in panic I kicked her and started blocking the bed (0 AP left). Frieda and Ian helped (more about Ian later on) until Finola showed up and switched beds with Frieda.</p><p>I skilled pilot to make myself a nice target here and hoped we would be able to somehow work this out though I knew we would be done without our pilots. Hua got hurt..might as well be bleeding and flying the ship as well as killing Hunters is not possible in the long run. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Kuan Ti entered and threw a grenade, but I rushed out of the room before he could finish me and he went to the medbay where he killed Hua. Frieda noticed that something strange happened and realized the transfer (I wouldn't have gotten that at all). So Janice was the mush now who ran up to the lab.<br>My conclusion: They shut down our pilots and were after our morale. I have to say that this whole plot was a masterwork. It is the best thing I saw a mush doing in all my ships. Whatever we were up to..we had to kill Janice (argl) before she kills Chun.</p><p>Stephen came along and asked how to help. He was about to kill Paola (Ian still around <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">), but I took cold blooded (nice xp timing) and told him that if he manages to finish off Janice, I get 2 shots at Paola.</p><p><strong><em>Math</em></strong> 2 AP cyclechange + Logistics + Cold blooded if Stephen gets the job done = 6 AP <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And..he did it <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":tid_lol:" class="tid_ico">. Janice was done, I was able to kill Paola and the mush were destroyed.</p><p><strong><em>The aftergame</em></strong></p><p>Our chatchannel..was depressing at first. We thought about the situation, but without Janice and me as the sole pilot at that time our chance of surviving was terrible. Not to mention our leaders and spiritual lights were both killed by the attack.</p><p>We started shitchatting, making fun and talking about the fact how awesome our mush were..yeah..no hate, just deepest respect <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Stephen and Frieda wanted to do the thing to boost morale, but Ian was around in medbay and I will not forget his:</p><p>"I'm in the way pretty often as it seems" which nearly made my sob as a player. Poor Ian <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong><em>BUT - The Ian story</em></strong></p><p>Sure he was around when Finola ( 1. round of mush) tried to kill Paola earlier and it might seem he was an annoyance, but..he clearly wasn't. He was a goddamn life saver. <br>Kuan Ti would have murdered the whole dorm without him being present.</p><p>In fact: Ian was the reason Kuan Ti had to move on after the grenade failed and that might have forced Janice to transform into Juan, but it also made our counterattack possible in the first place.</p><p><em>IAN! The silent and underrated hero of this round</em>.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I will stop it right here. I need to head back to my snowmen. Him and me..we got a whole planet to subjugate now <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>Good job making it back to Sol and it wasn't my leadership, but teamwork born out of a communal panicattack <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> With just one member in this operation missing..we would have failed pretty early.</p>
