                <p>Alright, Time for some typing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> <br>This ship : <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9071" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9071</a></p><p>Alright this ship was hard to say, unpleasent at some points for me but its got me to met some great folks in there which we had some fun times! So lets start about ship alright? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I try to keep short lol <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ((don't promise)) : I started game as Ian, Installed all cameras and moved stuff here and there. The crew was pretty much a "Normal" crew. Which Paola later on didn't agree on. It had one tech,three pilots, and a Leader jin.<br>What was worse about this ship? Was Newbe Derek, Shirkless Janice ((which in forward i need to talk with her about something <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)) And not so talkactive crew. BUT it could survive really good if a human would seriously organize this crew.</p><p>So mush select happen and i am mush alongside with Stephen! He was a great partner but a little too rushy(( sorry man just pointing some mistakes i saw xD)) . So humans had a great active Eleesha which i start to fall in love with and Paola! But some people like Janice and Derek gave us a hard time.Derek double eat after selection and idle around with Full AP and didn't done enough things to earn trust.</p><br><p>So in one word some humans played more mushy than mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I used this chance and extracted twice before day change and slept. Well people from my last ship and whos that know me , already know that this past weeks i was really busy with exams and stuff so i should and feel i MUST apologize. I HATE being an idle mush but due to this stuff irl i couldn't . Anyway Stephen too extracted and we set our targets slowly. For sure it was morale sources, and start was with Janice. Janice was a bronze player which didn't choose Shrink to make game more "challenging" for herself. And threatened us if we do something the judges are with her. ((In end i will answer her)) but we couldn't risk what if she choose shrink after we were in middle of our rampage?</p><br><p>So i infected her once in LAB! NOT MEDLAB! Ok? So this one part showed that humans ain't working together that well. Stuff happened and humans kill Derek, And Janice killed Kuan cause of visiting her. And since she done a food test cycle ago noone killed her. And Stephen turned her ((She had one spore from begin))</p><p>So at this point i gone inactive for near one day which i seriously apologize for! And when i got back humans found an O2 planet and we gone for it. Me and Stephen planned our way to IB with Jin and Hua. Here our plans got a little bad since Stephen forgot that he infected once already in that day so i just gone and infected Jin once. ((anyone who played Ian mush know how hard it is for them to go with an infection plan so don't get sad if i used rampage in end)) Anyway after expo and next day nothing interesting happened.</p><br><p><strong>Rampage plan!</strong> <br>Paola later on in rampage told me that mush shouldn't be happy about anything cause ship was inactive and nothing bad happened for them. Which at first i agree but at end no we wasn't that lucky <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Janice were too busy in real life to help us so i and Stephen made a plan. It was like this : I go to AD and defacter it, Then leave and Stephen enter and turn the Jin and then go to transfer to Terrence. I then transfer to Gioele ((Which had one spore from start)) and we kill pilots and techs. With all techs and morale source on our side humans would be dead.</p><br><p>But cycle before i came in game they sold Gioele. So plan changed and i decide to wait a little but Stephen were a little TOO rushy which made me make a plot in 5 min. I gone to AD defact, Infect jin, gone to BD and transfer to Hua. Stephen turned Jin in meantime but then when going for transfer to Terrence , He said "I have full skill slot" when i was plotting and thought about Stephen skills he told me he have two slot skill free but he was a little too rushy again and choose hard boiled and demoralize. ((I told you Stephen to not choose skills only in case you need it xD))</p><p>Anyway got Stephen move to BD and in meantime i throwed a genrade in AD and killed Eleesha and Roland with blaster. Eleesha was like a leader to human team and should be removed. After her death things got funny.</p><p>Paola told me that mush doesn't deserve to call this a victory. WHICH I DIDN"T! Seriously i got offended by you Paola. True humans didn't had good luck BUT first mush didn't have too second I NEVER was like going around like a brat being happy about my victory. As i said i turned this boring ship to a chess board. We both moved and paid the cost by two sides.</p><p>Anyway after this Andie come online and attack Stephen and run, Janice come online kill Andie but before healing Stephen she log off. I go to work come back and see Stephen first attacked three times and dead by fire in cycle change ((Which was sad since i lost only active partner here)) When i just was about to heal Janice chun killed her and attacked me. I dismantled second shower and knife then run outside with patrol ship. Why?</p><p>Because COMMANDER! was on our side. I asked Jin to send me a mission and load the fuel since Paola too was outside ((we had hunters on us)) But sadly Jin didn't got active ((he was inactive for a whole day i guess)) And next cycle i died.</p>

                <p>I know i wasn't perfect on this ship ((I just understood you can't play mush as a solo team after two ships)) But i done as much as i could to turn game to a fun ship. I really did enjoyed my little rampage. How humans moved and we replied and for sure if stephen didn't died and i came online and Janice or Jin su would come online and had transfer and gone for Terrence we could do a rush for Sol. Cause that was my goal to kill humans by morale problems. Since Ian had full morale we could rush pilgred and go for Sol. Stephen and me had tech , Commander was on our side too but inactivity in my side killed us too.</p><p>So i like to thank everyone on my ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/janice_kent.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JK:" class="tid_ico"> : Janice you were a player which know REALLY great about game. So read here , <a href="/tid/forum#!view/112222|thread/45831731" target="_self">Ask the SDF! #3</a> Read Spazticus ((game mod)) message. When you know how a skill is critical to game ((That you SURELY knew while knowing so much about other aspects of game)) and your team and NOT choosing it.

Also if i am part of RP or Die castings doesn't mean i MUST RP in EVERY single ship i play. Since this ship wasn't place for RP as i saw you didn't RP too. Also i didn't had time to RP so why so much hard feeling from a fellow casting mate huh? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/zhong_chun.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_ZC:" class="tid_ico"> : I hate you Chunny Chun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I hate you so much for killing my dear partners but at same time good job.

                <p>Hi I'm Chun from that ship and it just finally ended!</p><p>Have to say after your guys little rampage and turning Jin Su + Janice it made things very difficult. Eleesha and me had been talking for days keeping tabs on people but the humans made so many dumb mistakes that it was impossible to tell who was mush. Janice would not listen and stay out of the Medlab, she insisted on having a bed despite me and Paola protesting. Once she forced a food test on her self and passed I knew we were in trouble because several people had been passing through Medlab while I was researching. Me and Paola assumed she had been turned since Jin Su, Ian and Derek had all taken trips to see her.</p><p>Unfortunately we waited too long to act and the rampage + other fun stuff happened. After waking up and seeing my dead human friends I set out to murder the mush all sleeping in the dorm. Fought Stephen till I was too tired to continue and then laid down to rest and till I could eat again. Funniest thing happened though and a fire broke out and finished Stephen off at the next cycle change. Not sure when Janice was murdered by my hands in that ordeal but she didn't put up and a fight. Double shameful I missed her dropping the knife or I might have been able to finish you off as well Hua/Ian.</p><p>After failing to kill you though I was too tired to do anything else for a long time and you took off to space. While flying around waving your mushsack in our faces some people I trusted (Frieda, Paola and Raluca) came up with a plan to hack the ship and leave you behind before the captain came back whom we didn't really trust anymore. Paranoia was super high already and I always had max private chats going on, it was crazy.</p><p>So, we jumped the ship and left you behind which still said we had mush on board. I assumed it was Ian so Paola set out to kill him but failed unfortunately only being able to shoot him once and not in his dumb dumb face. He woke up and ran back to punch Raluca (we assumed spike / turn her) and then hide in a bay. We decided for now to just watch him and try to save the ship from asteroids / fires etc and get Pilgred fixed. He could die before we got back to Sol.</p><p>Strangely though he freaking turns out to be the original Hua who had been body swapped but NEVER bothered to tell anyone other than Paola for 17 freaking HOURS. I decided we could trust him because really his story was actually pretty believeable and killing him would take more AP than we'd have for quite a while. That left 1 mush on board and at this point I trusted no one at all. If I had the AP I probably would have killed two people just to try and save the other humans from being turned.</p><p>Had to sleep though and when I came back Jin Su had tried to murder me but I was saved by the body armor. He had been in our private mush hunt the entire time since he had been sick and "proved" human the day before. I hate the word "proven" or anything to do with it. Food tests and sick tests mean not a damn thing and anyone who thinks they do is dooming your ship to a sad death.</p><p>He failed because apparently I was Kung Fu Chun this ship and broke his neck with several quick chops. Mush counter = zero but paranoia is still breaking through the armor and beaming into space. We come up with a plan to rush Pilgred and get back to Sol before we get blown up. Frieda and Paola turn out to be excellent for the most part with Paola shooting down hunters like a trained sniper.</p><p>Unfortunately this is where our plan fails. Ian and Raluca turn out to be 95% inactive at this point and I assume they either aren't playing anymore or are just mush pretending to be inactive. We keep the ship going for another day or so hoping Raluca will help relay rush Pilgred but it never happens so in the final moments of the ship with fires everywhere and a dozen hunters melting the last of our hull I kill her and the ship explodes.</p><p>All in all an amazing ship and once I'm done editing the video will upload it. Cheers and look forward to another jump on the 23rd at 8pm CST.</p>

Mod on Mush EN and Mush FR. In this ship, before my conversion, I did half of the relays and I spent all my AP on antimush researches.</p><p>I explained you why I took this skill and you saw my great work on the researches thread.</p><p>I only did a food test when Chun said she'll kill me if someone is coming to the medlab. For the record, I asked to work asap on the alarms and the mycoscan but, like you saw, people weren't motivated about the antimush researches.</p><p>About the bed, Chun forgot Paola didn't unlock the ghost and it was impossible to work on the mycoscan when Chun isn't in the lab and we were working on it. Sadly, Ian wasn't in the lab or in the medlab. I also said to Chun Ian was strange because his behavior changed right after mushs selection. More silent, avoiding to work in the lab and to protect her as a shield. That was suspicious. She wasn't fond of investigations.</p><p>As confirmed human, I asked for the list of the players who traveled by the bravo dorm. The point was to have an idea of the mushs. By experience, a mush can't do his human work and his mush work. He loves the extraction before the gas and the serum and that's precisely why it's important to have the list of the players who are relaying and the thread about the activity of our pilots. If someone isn't inactive, isn't doing his human job and is too often in the bravo dorm, it's very suspicious. With the lost list from Xyloph, it's easier to search the mushs.</p><p>We also kept a cam on the bridge when we had the link (no needs to go there excepting for Jin Su) and that's why I suggested to work on the alarms. Many players came in the medlab before I finished them and I was converted despite of my warning about this room. I only have a little of time during my lunch so I killed Kuan Ti who was in the medlab without a reason. He said I did nothing and it was a good joke with my relays. He also never ask to Chun who was confirmed humans and I finally had the proof he didn't read the threads (like I said I did half of the relays). When I killed him, I became dirty with an excuse to extract later. I also said we can add confirmed humans in the "real" mush hunt channel with confirmed humans. Kuan Ti created his own channel without wondering who was confirmed humans to Chun so I suggested there was maybe mushs on board who wants to kill me because of my work in the lab. Good explanation and good cover but I needed more time. I was really busy in my real life.</p><p>Paola claimed I changed the settings. If my memory is good, that was what she said to have an excuse to kill me as mush. She was totally wrong. Not because I was a beta mush but for an other reason. She didn't check the Nexus: I didn't came here ! Last time I used the bios terminal, it was for the priority on the astro 1-2days before and we had NERON who said who was dead after that. When someone is killed in a room with the defacer, we can't have the information. Only the classic -1 morale point. That was the reason why Neron said nothing about her death. Sadly, the defacer was in my dorm when I was offline with a new mush : Jin Su. I hadn't enough time (still lunch) so I killed Andie with the excuse he was dirty without reporting his statut and because he was also in the room with the defacer when I was back online. I had no idea of what happened and I had only a few HP left. I chose to pretend to be human like before, trying to save time. The problem is the defacer in my room. I was sure they thaught I'm the new mush but... Jin Su will have a chance.</p><p>It's not IT expert who ruined this ship but the incapacity of the humans to work correctly on antimush researches quickly. And that's exactly why IT expert was better in our situation. The problem wasn't the morale but the lack of relays for researches. Each player without a specific task like Gioele (solid) should help. Remember who really helped in the lab ? I'm not sure we'll have less mushs without my help with antimushs researched.</p><p>Now, this ship is over. Do you really think the problem was the lack of shrink ? Automatisms and preconceived ideas almost killed us. You didn't see and still don't understand that in this kind of situation, without paranoid and an Andie pilot and a Ian strangely out of lab/medlab,, we have to be quick with antimush researches because it's not possible to protect all of the key rooms without the alarms.</p><p>Trust me, it's very sad to read "griefer" [...] when you're spending all of your AP to support your team. The only thing of their mind is "omg, he didn't pick the optimal skill so he's a griefer". It's not as easy as that. As human, I helped my side. As beta mush, I helped my side too even if I hadn't enough time. Each key moment was when I was eating in my real life.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">I'm tired tonight so I'm sure I missed a lot of things.</span></p>

                <p>Ok Hi Janice,First of all chill out bro no need for hard feelings now. This shit from start was mixed up. I already told you ALOT that it is my view on this thing. You when was human could help them with taking shrink and still work on research. Right now in my ship i am Janice too and didn't took IT expert but still working on research and getting it out really nice. Honestly after D2 it didn't mattered if you finish CS or ASG since it didn't bothered us maybe mycoalarm but as you saw nothing like that could stop us from converting morale source. Worse case it was plan would happen in C8 and i infect twice and transfer and Stephen turn you.</p><p>But why talking like this? Ship is over and we are done! Why being like this and have hard feelings on eachother? i didn't meant you are bad or anything at game just wanted to tell ya that mods are talking about that in forum and one of them said something similar to our case. So no hard feeling ok? xD Just helping you out <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Janice was never added to any trusted channels by me (Eleesha did add her though) due to the fact she was continually alone in Medlab with people passing through. If someone does the food test then sure, I trust you for that cycle, maybe, but if you keep making mistakes the trust is gone.</p><p>And honestly the biggest problem this ship had was the human crew doing mush-like things. Any player with any experience knows not to a) be in the medlab alone and b) pass through medlab if someone other than Chun is in there. All you do is paint a huge target on both of your backs and sow paranoia. Not having shrink sucks but was very minor compared to the horrible play exhibited by the human side.</p>

                <p>Any player with any experience knows a) The bed in the medlab is totally safe if people is rushing the alarms b) we can hide one of them here to have a safe place c) It's very important to focus on antimush researches at the beginning of the ship to have more safe place and penalities for the other side.</p><p>When the players aren't looking who is going to often in the bravo dorm for the shower and when they're not helping often with antimush researches, mushs can do what they want. That's why we need to rush them asap. In a ship, with the alarms asap, it's very hard to convert someone. I explained that a ton of times when I was desperate about the lack of relays given.</p><p>Both Ian and Stephen come to the medlab and to the bravo dorm without a reason. That's what is wasn't seen on the channel I had with Eleesha. I asked her the list of the players who came by this room to avoid a conversion. Especially when I saw it was very hard to have relays. I have no intention of hurting my team's chances to win with the relays on antimush researches when I was a human and it was the same after my conversion.</p><p>I still don't understand why Kuan Ti was in the medlab. I read IG he created an other mush hunt channel. He explained that again here but... why staying in the medlab ? There was no reply from you in the researches thread and you gave me the perfect excuse to kill you and to be dirty for the first time.</p><p>With IT expert, Janice starts with 4 free points. They can help on antimush researches when the games starts for exemple. Once the more important researches are done, she can switch between the projects and the researches. For exemple, the plasma shield and her title is perfect to help a technician with the CPU priority on the projects.</p>
