That was an awesome ship for sure <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I really enjoyed its end with Sol Return of 5 people that last until day 10 finished Pilgred <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"> So lets get to story :<br><strong>General View</strong> <br>Well ship started and its look better than my recent ship with many inactive ones. Gold Jin,Gold Janice,Gold Raluca, Gold Paola ((Thanks to bro <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)) And newplayers that liked to learn ((I guess)) . Ian was noob and was kind of starting a revolt in first days with saying "Lets newplayers have right to fly with patrol ships" After that he start to mess around ship. Stephen and Gioele were pretty good they were active 3 or 4 cycle,Terrence were bronze but active,Andie was poly and active and mad for researchs <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>And player i hate most :CHUN!!! Dang i forgot to report her she was XP farming &gt;.&gt; Seriously she never talked and last until day 10? Thats not fair at least not for Terrence and Andie for later on.<br><strong>First Start</strong><br>So ship expect some griefers and some noobs were good,all three main roles was filled with active peoples.But since i should have gone to Bridge i couldn't do much in Mush hunt.Well from what i felt ((this feelings were right most of time)) All three were humans so we start a little mush hunting channel without Chun. Kuan was new but really active i liked him <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Good guy. Everyone worked in projects really good. Andie doing good researchs. But only problem our only Astro was inactive. So Until day 4 everything were normal i was decoding everything <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Until Hua made a move. <br><strong>Mush hunting</strong><br>Well our suspects were Eleesha ((That done so many mushy stuff)),Raluca and actually no one else. Raluca got removed since Jin checked some logs and said she spend AP on projects(( But That lvl 9 skill <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">)) So we was to watch Eleesha. Until Hua made a little bad move. I guess if mush had a better team work atleast you know. Well she came into BD and taked off Camera then spiked Stephen turnned him to mush then run with Scrap Collecter. It was bad since really how you expect mush live with two gold guys in there <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> So well we killed Ian ((griefer)) , Eleesha ((possible mush)) and that made Janice die <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> We asked Raluca to load the fuel but she didn't ,If she did she would live for more days for sure <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Well we killed her and Moved ship. Well after that Andie saved us by a O2 planet we gone for expo but after that Andie go inactive, Derek and Roland ((two newplayer)) same. I sold Roland for O2 and got two great skills book and got pilot for myself <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Gioele and Terrence rushed Pilgred and after that ship going slowly to D10. We lost Terrence too due to he became inactive. And in end we four remained <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ((Chun wasn't even playing =.=))</p><p>Thanks to :<br><strong>Jin The Lover</strong> haha i hit him then do the thing with him. I guess i should take wild tittle.<br><strong>Paola the Wild</strong><br><strong><span class="tid_strike">Daddy</span> Gioele The Awesome</strong><br><strong>Kuan the Architect</strong><br><strong>Terrence the Tech</strong><br><strong>Andie the Hero</strong> ((thanks for O2 ))<br><strong>Stephen The Unlucky</strong><br>And thats it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It was a great game talk so i can add you to my contacts <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>You also broke the end page somehow. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Hi Paola, Jin here. Let me start by saying that I won't make any comment about what happened in that dorm. If your father found out... wait, he already knows. But hey, how could I resist such a lovely young lady ? (Not like I had a choice, since you kept tricking me into getting up or even hitting me to force me to leave the bed... but I can't say that I complained about that.)</p><p>So, this ship... Weird ship, really, but certainly remarkable. A mixture of good and bad at the start, and a great ending despite a situation that could have been considered hopeless. We did have several gold members in the key roles, and I must admit that we had a lot of luck too. The RNG gave us Plasma Shield from a Neron upgrade, Tech and Pilot magebooks from Xyloph right before we found out that our alphas were Hua and Raluca, merchants that offered oxygen, allowing us not to worry about it after the first expo.</p><p>But we also had a shaky start, with griefer Ian who hacked the Bios and removed the Nexus camera (it took poor Derek days to kill him), lots of new players including inactive Frieda, Roland who was Russian and went idle, Derek who died early too, and then active players who died of inactivity, like Terrence and Andie. Oh, and Chun, of course. I can't believe that she survived all this time, while Gioele and Kuan Ti nearly died from morale or injuries several times. She saved herself from starvation by eating bananas, never cuddled the cat, never healed herself (and we certainly never wasted a single AP on healing her or giving speeches for her), and yet she survived until the end. Luckiest player I've ever seen...</p><p>Mush hunting felt unsettling too, because of all those new players doing strange things, of Ian acting mushy, because of the fact that, apart from Andie and Frieda, every single crew member had occasions to get dirty or take sneaky showers. People entered BD for no reason and left, Hua wasn't very active as a pilot, Eleesha repeated several times that she got dirty repairing an oxygen tank that I had repaired myself (in fact she fixed the fuel tank, but her moves had been strange anyway). Hua outed herself by removing the BD camera just before a third mush appeared and then escaping in the Pasiphae. We killed Eleesha who was standing in BD and was already suspected, but she was human. Then Raluca betrayed herself by going to the engine room to load fuel at my request and not actually loading the capsule she'd taken from the tank. As for Stephen, killing him was a bit of a gamble, because there were several people in the dorm at the time, including Derek, Janice and I, all logical targets. I decided to go for Stephen because he went strangely mute after reporting that Hua had removed the camera. The third mush appeared, and Stephen stopped talking and ignored my requests for help, whereas he had been very active until then.</p><p>Unfortunately, all these deaths caused Janice's death, which was a pity because she was gold, active and experienced. Poor Janice's last words were to tell me that her morale was low, but that she should survive until I could give a speech if she was lucky... which she wasn't.</p><p>So, around Day 5, we were mush free but also in a bad situation. Our morale was low and we had no shrink (fortunately, I'd saved a spot for Leader or Strateguru, which allowed me to rush around the ship giving speeches after all the deaths). The Pasiphae had been abandoned with Hua. Our oxygen was getting low, we had no astro and no botanist. Only six of us were active. But those six never gave up and certainly made up for all the dead and inactive people. Andie found us the oxygen planet we needed, and then we traded Roland for oxygen. The magebooks helped too. Gioele became a Tech and helped Terrence finish Pilgred. Paola became a Pilot after comms were done, and I must say, hunters have never been so easy to deal with. We slept alone in a dorm, sharing our Logistics AP so that we each had 3 AP per cycle. We had Plasma Shield, Blaster Gun, Trail Minimizer, the D7 rebel base, Sniper's helmet, two pilots with Shooter and Logistics. We could have lasted longer and hunters wouldn't have been a problem for days. We also managed to take care of plants and do research and projects, although we had to give up on RFS after Andie died. But no regrets there. That D10 with only 4 actives in the end (I don't count Chun) was definitely worth a D15 or 20 with a more active, experienced crew.</p><p>I'd really like to thank Paola whose activity largely contributed to our survival, and Gioele and Kuan Ti, who were both beginners and did remarkably well. All in all, I enjoyed this ship a lot.</p>

In a sense, this ship was good for a new player who wants to learn, because we all had to do things outside our basic roles - gardening, astro, research, projects, healing... You weren't stuck in the Nexus relaying projects, which could have been less instructive and more boring.</p>

When we told her to hide the alarms she did nothing but research and when we needed her to stand in the lab so we could research mycoscan she continued to sleep in medlab and research worthless stuff.

And when we asked her to help a little solving out mush problems in a mush-hunting chat, wich she's being ignoring for ages, but when we showed all the perseverance we could, she said "if you really want to be helpful, do the relays!" God damn relays when everyone was nearly diying and the hull was nearly destroyed, ha. But the funniest part was when she started accusing us (including Spazticus, hehe) in being the nubbiest noobs in the whole Galaxy (in response to our rage on her behavior). Far from her, being a 5 time Eden traveller and a really wise player. Sad I don't have the quotes from her speeches - they were really marvelous. <br>Seems, it's a widespread mental ilness among chuns <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>PS: kisses from Gioele :3</p>
