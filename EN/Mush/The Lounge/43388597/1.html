The only inactives at the start were Jin Su, Stephen, and Gioele. No vital roles, thankfully. Unfortunately, there were some disagreements about organization between Terrence and Kuan Ti that lead to many disgruntled engagements. I tried my best to make them more light-hearted as it felt like Terrence was in-character as his grumpy self and Kuan Ti wasn't liking it.</p><p>Selection happens and I end up as Mush with Derek. I make a private chat with the gentleman and hoped he would end up responding back. I then decided to help with ASG with Ian, who was desperately trying to get a relay partner. I had the capabilities to grab fertile and mycelium if need be so them getting research up was of no set back for me.</p><p>Derek eventually responds back and we both decided we would lay low and watch the crew's movements. I decided to get dirty loading fuel and created a spore easily enough with Fertile. The hull was already at about 70 despite it being the start. The pilots were the last ones awake, so I already began thinking about targeting pilots.</p><p>A few days go by, Frieda and Raluca both go inactive (commander title being passed to Kuan Ti). I decided to tell Derek my idea in hopes that we can discuss a tactic. I head up to help with CSS (again, poly Andie and everyone else refused to help Ian with research with the occasional bump from Eleesha). There was some talk about selling Jin Su for a project, Paola does so (had my fingers crossed it wasn't Plasma Shield!).</p><p>My plan was simple. Derek would do what Derek does best and kill Terrence and Hua (I made emphasis on Terrence who was the most active and reliable pilot). I told Derek that we'd have to act soon before we complete CSS so he can extract and phago a spore for the rampage. After Terrence and/or Hua was killed then I would stay under cover and let that hull tick down (would've been easy, I'm very good at covering tracks). As I head down to Alpha Dorm, Ian decided to relay himself and was able to finish CSS. I sigh but continue forth.</p><p>once I entered AD I hit "Lay Down" before checking the log. When I was nice and comfy in my bed I saw Derek's sprite there. I check the log and noticed he had murdered Hua. Reaction said "RUN, Janice RUUUUUN!" Run I did. I head out to AB and put out the call that Derek was rampaging. Derek then responds in my private message asking where Terrence one. I facepalm and tell him that He was in AD on the bed (right next to Hua) and told him that he should've killed Terrence first. Derek leaves AD into RC... Goes back to AD... Leaves AD to AB to see me banging my head on nearest objects, then he reenters AD and starts beating on Terrence.</p><p>I calmed myself. "Ok... He's Derek, he should be able to end him... I've seen Dereks kill 4-5 people before". He then comes up with another message saying "Wow he's hard to kill". He had failed. A cycle later he was dead. I don't blame him, accidents happen but you should always talk to your teammates before you act. I just threw the idea out there to see what he thought about it.</p><p>Had to revise my strategy... I could no longer allow myself to get caught under any circumstances. No matter what kind of damage I could do they could recover and just rush Pilgred. They had 4 techs (including inactive Raluca). Frieda ended up coming back, too and was fairly active. I needed an opening. Luckily, everyone was pointing fingers at each other in private. Terrence began talking about me possibly being a Beta (from Derek entering AB) which had me a bit wary but I knew they didn't have any solid proof and I just simply asked Mycologist Ian to heal me when he's able to remove any possible spores.</p><p>Another reason they thought I was a beta was that I ended up on an expo with Frieda, who was a suspect at the time. The expo gave the max amount of oxygen which set me back a ways. I started playing with the idea of sporing food. I'm a pretty trustworthy sort of person and I was confident I could've gotten someone to eat food or even spored bananas for Ian to eat. But something else happened...</p><p>After the death of Derek, the three active techs ended up in the same dorm together. I also remembered that the knife was in plain sight in Icarus Bay. Three people were a lot of people to kill, though... I decided to hold off for a bit. Then the crew began discussing Kuan Ti going up to the bridge for full time astro duties while Frieda went full time piloting. Kuan Ti had Astro, Tech and other stuff. I needed him dead if my plan was going to work but if he went across the ship then I'd be wasting too much AP to move to him later. I had to act soon. I took a free bed in Bravo Dorm and laid there quietly throughout Christmas (I got up once to hug Frieda and Paola because they asked, had to keep up appearances).</p>

                <p>Next day I got up at the end of Cycle 8 and left the dorm. I extracted my free spore for the day and went to Icarus Bay where I grabbed the knife. I then went to the Nexus and messed with Bios. Turning off priority, food destruction (just to be spiteful), and the death notifications (main reason). I then waited for the cycle to end and a new day to dawn. I immediately extracted a second free spore and grabbed transfer.</p><p>I walked my way to Alpha dorm where the techs were all having their sleep over. Eleesha would be my first target. If, for some reason, I am not able to kill them all and get killed myself, then I would want them not to know that all the mush were dead (remember they thought I was possibly a beta). Eleesha died rather quickly, I ended up hurting my shoulder though. I phago'd my first spore and stuck Terrence with the second (I did that to make sure I didn't get overzealous and accidentally use all my AP doing the stab dance on Kuan Ti).</p><p>I stab Kuan Ti to death (ended up biting my tongue which had me laughing because of my next step). I then dropped the knife and transferred into Terrence (all active techs taken care of, plan successful). Ian was quick to notify the crew that people were dying but no notifications were coming up. I was labeled as the most likely suspect due to my access to BIOS. I tell them that scrambling room logs can also stop notifications. I saw two people on the bridge and one person was moving south. The whole reason about turning off death notifications was so that nobody would know WHERE people were dying. The last thing I wanted was Ian to pop in the room mid-rampage.</p><p>I began wheeling my crippled ass north and I had a choice to make. Ask Ian where Frieda was or ask Ian to check on Raluca. Part of me wanted to kill inactive Raluca on the off chance she popped back in like a super hero. The other side of me wanted to kill Frieda which would have expedited their death having lost their last most active pilot (I didn't bother killing my old body Janice. With her having a ruined tongue, no AP, and morale not my goal , there was no reason to).</p><p>I asked Ian where Frieda was and went up to the bridge. Ian told me she was on the bridge and Paola was moving south. I curse to myself because I knew who the second person on the bridge was. Sure enough, Ian was right by Frieda. I tried to convince Ian to go protect Raluca but Ian wasn't stupid. I rolled my eyes and looked at the shelving unit and noticed a juicy astrophysics book. Being the spiteful jerk I am, I ate that real quick. Ian stepped off the bridge so that Paola could attack me (with little success). Then Chun came up and attacked me (right as Ian reentered, lol. 3AP a punch). I was a hilarious little 6 health now (I didn't have any armor). I then made it aware to them. "If you kill me, I win."</p><p>It was true, I was their only hope for getting Pilgred up. Janice entered the bridge and began throwing post-its everywhere which caused Paola to get off the sofa to read them. I smile and kick my feet up (metaphorically as I was Terrence) on her sofa. I began taunting them ruthlessly as they began planning a doomed RFS rush. They only had one Biologist and Andie wasn't helping research, why worry?</p><p>Frieda became active and ran for medlab. Having 1 AP left from attacking her earlier (One stab was 3AP when Ian entered mid-attack) and knowing she was almost dead, I immediately gave chase. There was an inactive Gioele in FC so movement was free. Once in medlab I swiped at Frieda with my last AP and missed. She left after that. I thought she self healed but I don't see anything in her end-game that says she did so I guess I scared her away before she could. Chun was hot on my heels, too and attacked me in Medlab. Now I was 1 hp and she was out of AP.</p><p>I was fine with this, less AP and help they would have to work on RFS. I then taunted them by telling them I can dismantle the disk and I went to the lab. Janice immediately grabbed the disk and Ian immediately grabbed the cat (to prevent me from suiciding, if I die I win. I knew this, they knew this). The next hour I spent taunting them and I started bringing the crew into private chats one by one. I told them terrible things like "I'm going to murder someone next cycle. I'm 1 hp, if you have any sense you'd come up and kill me." I got some fun responses from Chun and then Frieda gave me frustrated responses (I knew she was in give-up mode after that). I even almost talked Ian into finishing me but their resolve was strong.</p><p>It was nearing cycle end, the research crew wasn't getting the help they desperately needed to do a rush. Chun was trying to coax me to going into medlab next cycle to "kill me" but I knew she was going to heal me while Janice performed a ceasefire. I told her to come on the bridge, instead. The timer began to count down. I believe I had Frieda out for blood and felt she's come up and murder me the next cycle (also I would be able to take a few more stabs at her). Cycle change happens and... NERON decides he'd finish the job! A collapse and no more techs!</p><p>They tried to get organized to get RFS up (I had a few of them convinced that there was another mush aboard in order to waste time and AP). They also discussed how to work on Pilgred, Paola had hoped they might end up with a trader. Eventually Frieda dies from hemorrhaging due to my attacks. Roland didn't end up checking in that day either. Another wave of hunters came and it wasn't long before the ship blew up.</p><p>It was a fun ship. You guys had a lot of potential but there was just too much distrust and infighting for things to be productive. It was especially fun hearing about Eleesha wanting to kill Kuan Ti and Kuan Ti wanting to kill Eleesha. If there's anything to be learned from this... HIDE THAT KNIFE!</p><p>I really hope you guys had fun, though. I try to be as entertaining as I can as a mush as it is our job to make the game interesting. If you had a miserable time (Like Hua, apparently) then that wasn't my intention and I apologize. Hope to hear from you all!</p>
