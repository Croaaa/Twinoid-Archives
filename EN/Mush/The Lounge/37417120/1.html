                <p>Hi Guys - I was Chao</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3337" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3337</a><br><a href="http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/ship/v/3337" target="_blank">http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/ship/v/3337</a></p><p>It started off as a normal ship - two idlers, Gioele in CC, Stephen in the refectory. We go on one expo, bring back lots of food - Hua brings along the whole noteblock, being somewhat new to expos. Research is humming along, and we have most of the good stuff by D3. Now, D3c6 I wake up, check the logs, move the freezer and freeze most of the food. I saw a note from Chun that Kuan Ti has just found from mycoscan that he has 2 spores, and we have suspects, but he was going back to Bravo Dorm where there was a camera.</p><p>It was about this time I wandered over to #mush-en, for the first time in a week or so, and a friend in there was talking about how he was about to go on a murderous rampage next cycle that involved killing Chun and transferring to someone on the bridge. Then he started sounding like Roland. Then he started sounding like Roland <em>on my ship</em>... "Gosh the guy I just spored twice disappeared for 7 minutes (Room logs, KT left for 7 minutes) - hope he didn't get himself checked out with mycoscan. Hua just took the whole block of notes on the expo! Hey, hope no one here is on a shop D3c6!"</p><p>At first I was conflicted, but seeing how Chun, the only one who had <span class="tid_strike">consented</span> been tattooed by me was at risk, I had to act fast. (More on tattoo's later). At first I tried to rouse the troops to battle the incoming danger. But then I remembered - I'm Chao! Who needs consensus? Hua did manage to pick up the other blaster, and I started attacking Roland, but unfortunately even with eating, have run out of energy and AP.</p><p>Suddenly there's something different about Roland. He's got a little rain cloud above his head. Now, I'm no Eleesha, but it looks like that was a transfer! Roland runs off, and PMs me telling me he was formerly KT and worried he's going to be killed - Roland openly spored Hua. At this point Neo-KT has access to my whispers about busting him anyway, so I start posting in chat, and deadly Terrence comes in and takes out KT. KT's last ask was to start a health thread to ask for heals, which we actually ended up using the rest of the ship. It made me smile each time I thought of how brassy a move it was.</p><p>Moral of the story - be careful in IRC, and be wary of mood frippery.</p><p>We decide to start going after the inactives when the should be mostly starved, and I got three good shots into Gioele, and Frieda came and finished him off - Mush # 2. Our bar was clear of mush, and then Stephen starved shortly after. Janice had also gone quiet, and we shoved her out of bed. We decided to heal her from her starvation damage to keep her passive bonus going, but we ran into a snag - Janice was at full health. She was still at full health a few days later. She was in full health for days, until we voted to put her down nearly a week later. - But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p><p>Our mush hunting thread was impressed - she went inactive so quickly, they must have turned gioele very early. In fact, we knew there was 4 spores on the crew - 2 on KT, 1 on bridge person (Jin Su) and the one on Hua, so with the 3 they used to change. We continued to bust out expos, comms, projects and research, and while our expos weren't giving us pieces of Edens, we were hunting gods - at one point we had 37 rations in IB. We got a shrink book, and I became the second ship therapist.</p><p>.... To be continued</p>

(Also, if we serumed her, she would have then started starving to death.)</p><p>Anyway, going back to the story - so while we were doing expos, before we were 100% we just hadn't miscounted when Janice had gone innactive, we had a couple of tricky bad luck expos. Most of us on the expo had betrayed our humanness in one way or another - getting sick, or eating twice, or Paola's report and Jin Su started pressuring Terrence to do a mush test, since he was the only one not proven human via those methods.</p><p>Frieda and I said we were against testing, (Frieda perhaps a little stronger), and Terrence disappeared for a while. (Actually, RL was tough for all those in the ship, and we all disappeared at times). Behind a whisper, a fervant discussion opened up. Jin Su wanted to murder all his potential mush list, which at the time was 3 strong. I advocated leniency, since I didn't think the people were mush except Janice, who was easily contained even if she suddenly came back to life. What was eventually was decided was to serum Terrence, and then discuss further the other two on Jin Su's list. Because of the continued paranoia, and because probably everyone felt more comforted by my discussion of torture etiquette than standing around with a sleeping mush, we voted to use the natamy rifle (still in progress) on Janice. I asked to be the one to pull the trigger, since i hadn't killed anyone on the ship yet.</p><p>However, while I sleeping and the natamy rifle was finished, Jin Su swooped in, killed Janice, called the whole crew pacifists and challenged me to a mush test. I countered, saying that I would if he would subject himself to a natamy rifle test since we were both proven human at the same time. This, and probably more the rest of the crew being so kind to me, seemed to settle the issue.</p><p>I have to give Jin Su credit for being reliably on to move the ship and giving lots of speeches, and going with us on expos. In many respects he was an excellent Jin Su. I did not appreciate his continued pushing of mush tests and murder, (and indeed before we went to Sol he snuck in one last attack on Eleesha). Then there was the compass thing.</p><p>We were gathering for yet another expo, and Jin Su had run down and grabbed the compass, which I thought I had mentioned should go to the diplomat. Finola came down and had to go before Jin Su could drop it, and I said something cheeky about blaming Jin Su if she got lost, and Finola said something like, "I'm counting on it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">".</p><p>I bet you can see where this is going.</p><p>In hindsight, as neo-Roland pointed out, we should have waited for Finola to come back and give her the compass, especially since we just hung around outside the planet for the next few days. But instead we went down, and wouldn't you know Finola got lost and died.</p><p>The ship was very quiet the next few days. We mostly kept ourselves alive, but even then we were making silly mistakes like not realizing the 02 tank was broken. I don't think things picked up till nearly day 15, when we made the choice to return to Sol. (Also, Ian died, our faithful plant man).</p><p>I didn't mention it, but the crew was composed of people who played very well, and several people I enjoyed playing with verbally. We had several people give generously for gold projects, and we busted out all our research very well. It's a shame RL was so demanding for many of us, and that we lost our diplomat. Our mush- transfering out of our pilot, going inactive but in a helpful way - were very handy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">. Hope to play with you all again.</p><p>Edit - Almost forgot - Tattoo reference</p><p>Day 2 - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/t4rUlAZ.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/t4rUlAZ.png</a><br>Day 7 - <a href="http://delzoup.imgur.com/all/" target="_blank">http://delzoup.imgur.com/all/</a></p><p>Wish I had saved the dialog for when Raluca promised me a jewel encrusted blaster, to remind me of her always. And many other things the crew said - (Why do I always remember to save these things too late?).</p>

                <p>Oh wow, I just happened across this. I was Finola from that game. I was so upset when I saw I died from getting lost, especially after joking about it beforehand. And then it took me a while to understand I died instantly, instead of slowly losing morale, waiting to be found, which was even more upsetting. But what can you do? It's a shame too, that was my first attempt at Eden.</p>
