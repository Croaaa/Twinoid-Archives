                <p>Speaking of course, of this ship:<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4481" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4481</a></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/zhong_chun.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_ZC:" class="tid_ico"><br>Chun here! Hoo boy, what a journey!</p><p>I'll recount what I could, because DAMN that ship was a doozy.</p><p><strong>Day 1-3, The slow start</strong><br>Things started slow for us. Activity was quite low, with three inactives and quite a few foolish newbies right off the bat. Derek and Eleesha both ended up idling in the front corridor, while Jin Su got stuck on the bridge. Andie had made it as far as the dorms before going to sleep <strong>forever</strong>.</p><p>Probably the only real saving grace of the ship that early was our active Ian, myself (as chun), and our pilots. Even with an andie about as useful as a third pinky (which is 90% of them) we still got research out pretty quick with a few good relays. Janice and Kuan Ti were both amazing, dropping projects to help us when we really needed to push out ASG and Constispore before the first daychange.</p><p>I know Raluca had taken her sweet time dismantling the alpha shower. I had been taken in by her claims of being a newbie, and we gave her a pass on it. I wouldn't have been surprised if she hadn't wanted to try to force a Sol return, being a solo Raluca, but my stern words towards the crew to not advance PILGRED had paid off in that respect. It was only advanced to about 33% before she feigned going inactive.</p><p>We also got an IT expert magebook, which was given to Frieda.</p><p><strong>Days 4-5, the Unhappy Rampage</strong></p><p>Around this time we had a full-on mush hunt going. Stephan and Gioele had both proven themselves human by shoving inactives around at my request, while Kuan was a regular visitor to the lab. Paola and Ian had ended up proving themselves human by eating to do their job, which was immensely helpful. Of course, my fear of an inactive going rampage turned out to be true when <strong>Raluca</strong>, who had went inactive during the day, took over our drooling Eleesha and killed Janice and Hua. While she claims she would have gone for me after that with the knife, I doubt she could have killed me (I was full HP with the armor at the time. It would have taken a fair bit of luck to kill me with the four strikes she had left)</p><p>With one mush down and a bunch of starving inactives, I took things into my own hands at this time. Rather than risk another rampage on our dwindling numbers. Gioele killed Terrance, who had spent most of the game idling in the refectory dirty. Pretty much the entire ship supported the move, as he was a massive drain on the ship. While I went and shot our Inactive Jin Su and Andie, the latter proving himself Mush.</p><p>Naturally, almost immediately after this (day 7 or so), we get a trade offer: A random crewmate for PILGRED. Without Raluca it was pretty much our only option. After a bit of confusion about communication Paola went inactive for a few cycles. Her title passed to Stephan, who went inactive the next cycle and passed it to Roland. With a push from Gioele soon after, we traded our Raleesha for our engine! We could go home!</p><p>Right afterwards, we visited a tiny 2-zone planet that frieda had found with mountains and O2. Giving us another day or so of oxygen.</p><p><strong>Day 7</strong></p><p>Our second expedition occurred in here. We were forced to move by asteroids and hunters, and rather than go to space I swayed Gioele to at least try and get us on ONE more expedition. The landing party was probably the strangest I had ever seen. I, as chun, was swinging around with a rope and two blasters. Paola and Gioele were there, armed to the teeth with drills and knives, and Roland was our very capable pilot. Sadly, despite quite a few good zones we just didn't get very much. Our final reward was a single Caleboot, which Ian had decided not to plant.</p><p>Not long after, Oxygen became a very real issue for us. Kuan Ti was a busy man after Paola got us a Technician magebook. He repaired both O2 tanks several times solo, and kept us afloat when we almost certainly would have lost a member of our now-tiny crew. Our second magebook was Biologist, which I took to continue my work (and relationship) with Ian.</p><p>Finally, just as hope was about lost, Kuan Ti revealed a planet with Oxygen! With only a single cycle remaining we arrived in orbit, and went on a quick expedition. Due to time issues, only Roland, Gioele, and myself (as Chun) went. Luckily, we did not run into a single fight (even in the shipwreak). As a bonus! We even came back with fruit! Jumpkins! and two days of oxygen! Horaaay!</p><p>...Gioele then, in a fit of foolishness... ate the jumpkin. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Sometime in this, Frieda died of morale loss. Judging from her last words, she had a panic attack. It was quite a blow, and a few of us (especially the men) were questioning why she didn't do the thing to increase her own morale.</p><p><strong>Day 8 and 9, the anti-climatic finale</strong></p><p>In day nine, we finally finished Extra hydropots. Ian got his garden up to full capacity, and research pushed along at a slow, but steady pace. It seemed that Stephan got bored over these last few days, eventually moving to RBS, and then suiciding by cat late in day 8. While a few of us were disgusted by his actions, there was nothing we could do.</p><p>Gioele and Paola kept on scanning planets, while Ian tended his plants perfectly and I worked dilligently in the lab. We got Narcotics Distiller to about 64% or so before something really bad happend: We got hit by two asteroids!</p><p>Luckily, we had 80 hull and a full shield before that. So while the hit was harsh, it wasn't fatal. Not long after Gioele and I had a small tiff about ration usage, where I had to explain that <strong>we would not starve because we have more coffees in a day than we have crew</strong>. Even despite my frusteration, I have to say I liked working with Gioele. He did a good job moving the ship, all the way up to Day 9, C3.</p><p>That was about... thirty minutes ago. I came back to a our plasma shield going down and Gioele asking someone to load fuel. I almost didn't go, as it's late, but I figured it would be a good idea to get us moved... in retrospect, I'm glad I did.</p><p>Apparantly we hadn't been keeping track of those last two asteroids very well. They were <strong>one cycle</strong> from blowing us up. Worse! When I went to load fuel I realized both fuel tanks were broken, and I was out of AP!</p><p>In a bit of a panic I let Gioele know that things were looking grim, and we agreed (reluctantly) that it was wise to return to Sol.</p><p><strong>Dramatis personæ</strong></p><p>Roland - Pilot, Comms Officer, and Knight in Shining armor. Your activity and positive outlook were essential to our ship. Thank you for your hard work. Your place in the scoreboard is well-earned (if maybe a little elevated)</p><p>Lai Kuan Ti - For a bronze newbie on one of his first ships, you were a great guy to work with. When something needed done you were always <strong>THERE</strong> on point. Without you, this ship would have fallen apart. If there is anyone I would give a PERSONAL gold supernova to, it would be you luv.</p><p>Gioele - Our arguments were hilarious, and you were a great guy. There were definitely some communication issues however. (I believe I may have called you a great french git in a few private chats. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"> ) Still, you pulled your weight and were a team player from start to finish. I wouldn't have traded you for anyone in the end. Even if you did eat the Jumpkin. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Ian - Every encounter I had with you, professional and personal, was a pleasure. I dearly hope you see this AP thread and reply. Without you and your wonderful garden, our ship would not have stood a chance.</p><p>Paola - For a first-time Paola, you did well. Try and focus on your AP efficiency a little bit. You missed quite a bit of things (bases and trades) that you shouldn't have. Keep at it slugger!</p><p>Frieda - I wish I could have done more for you. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> As Chun, I couldn't even directly help you with your morale when I knew it was low. Next time try not to let yourself get under 6 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico">. Yes, it is that important.</p><p>Stephan - Just.... why. You gave up, when you could have helped all of us get a casting ticket. Everyone knows what you did in that turret with Schrodinger, and you hurt everyone who did stick it out with your actions. Why?</p><p>Eluca - I would love to play with you again, you sneaky mushroom. Maybe next time on the same side!</p><p>Janice/Hua - I'm sorry! I should have gotten us to kill Raluca faster. My hesitation cost both of you your lives! Your deaths are my fault entirely.</p><p>The Inactive masses - How is it, working on an alien ship?</p><p>This is Zhong Chun, signing off for one last time before she reaches Sol</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/zhong_chun.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_ZC:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>You seem pretty cool, Jamini. I just completed my first ship last week, and it was a blast. I played a very active Andie, participating in Research, NERON, Comms, expeditions, and Mush hunt. Almost half our crew were inactives, and several active players were killed by Mush, so we were down to a skeleton crew, but we still made it to day 9 before the Hunters took us out. I ranked 3rd in my ship:</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4421" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4421</a></p><p>I'll be starting my second ship soon, and I hope we'll be crewmates so I'll have the opportunity to show you that Andie isn't as useless as you think. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>
