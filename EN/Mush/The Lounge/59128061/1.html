                <p>Janice Here, Hello everyone! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Yesterday our small journey reached its end at D5 and I am here to tell you guys that even being at opposite sides I had fun with you all. Except Ian who didn't liked my jokes (Just kidding <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>So for everyone who wasn't on this ship, and those who connected and found themselves dead (<img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico">) here's what happened:</p><p>=========</p><p><strong>Pre-Mush</strong></p><p>I joined at this ship as the 15th passenger by D2C6. <br>Luckily nobody had picked Janice, who is my favorite character so I had the pleasure of playing her again. <br>The ship seemed really active and during our trip we would only have a single idle (Jin su).</p><p>The crew had already built the sofa, fight off the first wave of hunters, 5 cameras installed, a nice o2 planet with 2 chances for an artifact (Intelligent life), made lenses and some other research and few useful projects like Automatic Sprinklers, Blaster Gun and Teslatron Reservoir and they even hacked the bios parameters for me.<br>It seemed too good for a random ship. With only Eleesha missing we all thought we were about to begin this trip.</p><p>Eleesha however was a heavy sleeper and took her almost a day to come out of the cryostasys.</p><p>By then we were fearing of losing D3 Base and another wave of hunters appeared. To avoid getting damaged I moved the hacker kit to the bridge and we stood ready to jump before they hit us.</p><p>We were prepared for everything, Eden awaited us.</p><p>=========</p><p><strong>Mush Selection</strong></p><p>When I logged back on D3C8 ready to hack us out of here I had a big pink screen saying "Welcome to the Dark Side" or something like that.<br>I immediately felt cheated... I received no cookies <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As I was thinking what I could do with my Mush-Janice (I have been away from the game for like 2 years and this was my 3rd game) who was barely lvl 5 mush I opened the Mush chat and saw who was my evil partner.... Paola.</p><p>With the exception of Finola we were probably those characters that you don't want to have while playing on the mush side. Paola had her sofa and was basically trapped inside the bridge with everyone wanted to employ her full AP into Comms.</p><p>Me on the other side wouldn't last much time alive if I got found dirty around the ship, and since rampaging and killing people right away ain't fun we decided to be sneaky mushes and play the nice girls.</p><p>=========</p><p><strong>The Hunt Begins</strong></p><p>Right after selection we saw half the ship running into the lab to relay anti-mush research, and as Paola got them the third base (and stole a mission saying she run out of ap at 98% <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) I was burning my AP relaying everyone like a good human.</p><p>There we found out that the only one with a starting spore was Raluca. Who had his private quarters in the Nexus under a camera and refused to work on Pilgred.</p><p>At the cycle of selection we already had our first confirmed human (second if you count chun) <strong>Giole</strong> as he double eated to rush research.</p><p>The crew seemed anxious to fight us, and they switched the pilots to BD to keep them clean and they started counting their AP versus the shots fired against the hunters.</p><p>At D4C1 We learned that the ship was unlikely to forgive any mistake, and as Stephen visited BD to clean himself he was put down to rest by our commander Chao as he tortured him and saw he bathed himself without using the soap. (RIP Stephen <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>At that same cycle Chao double eated so we had now 2 confirmed humans, Chun, 1 dead human and Jin su who was a vegetable staying in the safety of a dorm.</p><p>I hugged Schrodinger to look more human, comforted Chun and headed to AD.<br>We had decided to stay clean (no spores) and act human until the perfect moment to strike.<br>We did some work and relays as we waited. <br>Neither of us visited BD, where we were sure they were interrogating people left and right and thus making the list of suspects smaller and smaller.</p><p>In the mean time projects and researches advanced giving them Hydroponic Incubator (trade for Jin su), CPU Overclocking, Fission Coffee Roaster (neron upgrade), NERON Participation, Spatial Wave Radar, Constipaspore Serum, Gas, MycoAlarms and a few more that I don't remember.</p><br><p>=========</p><p><strong>Preparing the Attack</strong></p><p>We did a lot of planning on where and how to sabotage those puny humans, we knew we had to attack when they couldn't recover. <br>Luckily we received a big wave of hunters (19) by D4C5 that was no match for our 3 active pilot (frieda was a possible 4th one as they had an astro book a coffee powered Gioele could use), but gave us enough time to make the o2 hit that 8 unit left warning. <br>It was still too much for us to steal but we managed to delay the trip to the planet by pointing and creating doubts about Kuan (who got tortured) and Frieda as well as insisting on scraping first without lifting the lock on piloting, which took them another 2 cycles.</p><p>The most reasonable plan was hacking the command console and jump away from the planet (fuel was already loaded), grab the o2 and escape in the pashipae and a patrol with it.</p><p>But, as with every "perfect" plan complications appeared at the last minute and our next projects were <em>Plasma Shields</em>, <em>Extra Hidropots</em>, and <strong>Magnetic Net</strong>.</p><p>To make things worse <em><strong>Raluca</strong></em> had Genius, and instead of using it on plasma, they were advancing it the normal way (which was understandable as we had 3 techs on the ship).<br>If we attacked he could use it on Net and bring us back. <br>Raluca was now a problem... and she was online.</p><p>=========</p><p><strong>The Attack</strong></p><p>It was Cycle 8. The ship was now travelling towards the planet with only 6 o2 left and just a few minutes for cycle change. We had done the math, calculated Raluca's morale and with 4 demoralize actions + me near him at cycle change he would die without a doubt and that would save us from his genius skill on Magnetic Net.<br>Luckily Paola remembered that we only needed 2 spores to convert him. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>At those last 60 seconds before cycle change I left AD, extracted a spore in RC, infected Raluca at the Nexus in front of a Camera, removed the pilot lock, run to BD, grabbed the blaster and shot twice at Kuan (who was down to 6hp after the torture) but I only got him once (I was tempted to fire again and kill him but I knew I couldnt spend any more AP), left BD and run to CBS, dropped everything and grabbed 3 o2 to run to the IB and take off in their Icarus. (Return was already lost)</p><p>At the same time Paola was doing the same, stealing from CAS, spored Raluca again making him one of us and taking the Pasiphae.</p><p>=========</p><p><strong>After-Attack surprises</strong></p><p>We were pretty happy with our attack. <br>No killed humans, perfect coordination, gained 1 extra mush, no O2 left, no more genius, Pasiphae and Icarus stolen and it took us under 2 minutes. Raluca gave them extra Hpots wih genius making them lose Nets.</p><p>I had stolen the Icarus with 0ap/0mp left, and with full health hoping to get the o2 zone and getting killed by my traitor skill (the planet had after all 2 intelligent alien zones, low and high temp, oceanic and orchards). I knew that if I go with low hp I could die before hitting o2 and they could claim it with a patrol.</p><p>The exploration looked good, got hurt landing (no pilot skill), got o2 as the first zone, and aliens then left me at 1hp. Every 10mins I was saying bye to my Mush sisters.<br>However something unplanned happened and I got lost <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/21683" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/21683</a></p><div class="tid_spoil"><span class="tid_wspoil">Image in case you cant see the expo link:<br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/zR2rx0I.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/zR2rx0I.png</a></span></div><p>They were now able to "rescue" me and my 3 stolen o2 and we were unsure if they would get the other 8 from the planet.</p><p>They sent <strong>Chun</strong> to save me and the following happened</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/21684" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/21684</a></p><div class="tid_spoil"><span class="tid_wspoil">Image in case you cant see the expo link:<br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/34Mzh3g.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/34Mzh3g.png</a></span></div><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>(She got killed)</p><p>Meanwhile Raluca decided to finish Kuan, transfer into <strong>Roland</strong> and terminate his older body. Kill the cat and watch the Daedalous go down in chaos and lack of oxygen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We were pretty sure we had won as at the next turn they began dying from oxygen and morale from deaths and day change (-2 as chun died) so we said goodbye.</p><p>I went to eat and before going to sleep I decided to take a final look at the ship and I found <strong>Terrence</strong> going on a second exploration for me, and <strong>Roland</strong> dead from morale (?)</p><p>And he Found me!!!</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/21687" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/21687</a></p><div class="tid_spoil"><span class="tid_wspoil">Image in case you cant see the expo link:<br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/4RUVg9e.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/4RUVg9e.png</a></span></div><p>Luckily 2 cycles had already passed since we attacked and I found him during his exploration so I chatted with him until we arrived to the safety of AB and I took off in another patrol before he could hit me. (I was at 2hp) I just wished I had my trackie to laugh at them <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I think <strong>Paola</strong> eventually came back and took the bridge when most humans got killed as I saw her joking about it on the chat once I awoke dead in that patrol.</p><p>Another Deadalous destroyed by <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><br>This time the cute and innocent looking ones <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>========</p><p>Wanna tell the story from your point of view?</p><p>Kudos to Paola, Raluca, Terrence, Chao and Gioele who I found the most fun and interesting players <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Extra:<br><span class="tid_wspoil">When a human tells you the ship is "Absolute madness" you know you did a good job <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/NYnATqv.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/NYnATqv.png</a></span></p>
