                <p>Dear mushy crew! Dear Ian and Chun, Kuan Ti speaking! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We returned to Sol this morning at day 9 cycle 2, 9 mushes + Chun and Ian:</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8787" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8787</a></p><p>How did it end like that? More will be revealed later!</p><p>Let me just mention for now that I was alpha mush with Frieda.<br>And this ship was extremely fun, the mushes couldn't stop laughing seeing what did happen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>While taking over and making it unable for humans to do any antimush research, so many multiple mush tactics were used and every of it lead more and more to the inevitable mush win with Ian and Chun left.</p><p>Leading to hilarious conversations about proofs of Chun being mush for example ^^.</p><p>I thank everyone contributing to this ship, especially Frieda, Raluca, Jin Su, Janice, Roland and Andie, you were awesome.</p><br><p><strong><br>Frieda</strong>-she was my alpha mush partner and helped me to get Gioele and Jin Su (when it seemed really bad for me because of my fault xD ). Though she had not too much time, she was always there in the crucial moments in the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. Thanks, Frieda!</p><p><strong>Raluca</strong> - the only one with a starting spore, Europa, and the most dangerous human on this ship since she was the only one seeing through my magic of the disappearing mush sample.<br>Only with luck I managed to convert her with Infector when she was about to grab a ration for a relay session, she moved so quickly <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico">.<br>I am glad I got you to my side, you were my other half then and healed all the failures I did after your conversion xD <br>Amazing manipulation power <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> - such a fun commander, I loved when he worried about Paola when she was inactive and we needed xyloph for a new mush sample, he said: <br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Paola should be inactive by now, but she is not, why?, she maybe mush, stalling time, she love to see us waste our AP finding it. look at her smiling like that. <em>evil</em></span></span><br>At one point when we did a fail attempt to convert him, he saw through it and would have killed us, I guess. Luckily we got him in the end.<br>You were a great commander and a big help for the mush!</p><br><p><strong>Janice</strong> - She had already as human a nice RPing, she easily freaked out and was actually a shrink you wouldn't feel safe with...<br>She was a big help as human and as mush. Rala got her to do some bad things <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>And we converted her afterwards, so she doesn't have to suffer from any psychological trouble then.<br>I loved her messages, she was also the one who claimed Chun being mush near the end.<br>You helped greatly making this ship so much fun as it was!</p><p><strong>Roland</strong>- Oh, such an awesome newbie! Though being new, Roland was not only extremely helpful, he already knew more of the game than some experienced players and always asked what he didn' t know already. I read your end message, I am sorry Roland,you may be right, we could have go on a bit longer, but at least our hull was really damaged and I fear I was also too tired at that time from all the previous mush play to encourage the crew to go on longer though our win was sure. But as mush we won't get any ticket for day 10 anyway and I am sure a player like you will soon get the distinction of at least day 10 soon <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. Now in hindsight I must agree, we could ahve go on longer...well..</p><p><strong>Andie</strong>: So innocent, so helpful. Andie did the comms job fine though he preffered to be a pilot, in the end it was too late though and crew could not do any antimuhs research before almost everyone was converted. I liked your joyful nature!</p><p><strong>Derek</strong>: Sry man, I dunno whether it was necessary to kill you, but you were indeed very dangerous, with your wrestler you killed all wrong suspects with ease, I guess you would have killed at least one of us before we were able to get you, so it was good for us to get rid of you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Gioele</strong>, trapping Chun and Ian in lab and medlab was a nice idea, good job!</p><p><strong>Ian</strong> Don't react so annoyed, you have not always the opportunity to be a slave of mushes, you know? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Chun</strong>: Thanks for complimenting us, we actually didn't foresee you getting online again in the end and you almost killed Janice then. Thankfully we also failed in killing you before we found a way to protect Janice from you, so we had some time for funny conversations <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">. If you were more active in beginning of the game, whole game might have turned out different, this game showed what may happen when the humans have no mush hunters trying to get things under control.</p>

                <p>Janice here. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I just want to thank all the crew for the great ship. It was such an amazing and fun round and my best one by far as a mush. You guys did an amazing job at getting the entire ship converted in such a small amount of time. Three conversions in one day! Except Ian and Chun of course. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> That's insane!</p><p>It really does go to show how useful Anti-Mush research is from the get go. I want to thank all of you for being good sports and hostages too. Chun, you got me down to 1 health when you attacked me. Luckily RNG was on my side and the room never shook for the cycles I was away. Otherwise you would have gotten me! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It was a pleasure flying with all of you and I do look forward to being able to RP with you all again. Who knows, maybe next time we could go even further? For now though, I am happy to stay on my Ian and Chun farm harvesting their dreams to continue my Crusade to hell.</p><p>Hopefully I'll get to see you all on another ship once again. Maybe with less mush next time? <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/discrete.png" alt=":mush_chut:" class="tid_ico"></p>

But this ship is so hard to describe with story... It was one, gigantic ball of absurdality and laughter! But apart of that... Well... Only story worth telling is story of trust/mistrust relations that formed betwen Me and Janice...</p><p>At begining Kuan Ti stole Mush Sample. That is right! He didn't hide it. He defaced room before cycle end and took it into inventory. From this moment humman team was using countless amount of AP to just find it... I also took part of it, but I wasn't looking for it with my whole AP. Insted I decided to do some... OK! Know what? I see where it gets! It is going to be me telling detailed story of my ship AGAIN if I will continue... Damn it! Not going to happen! I will really try to be short this time.</p><p>So... Kuan Ti managed to get Mush Sample into inventory and whole ship was looking for it. When I noticed that we have problems with Mushes at this point, I dedcided that I can not simply stand in turret and get soon invaded by active and willing-to-take-risk mush. I knew that if I am to do anything to mushes I must be getting bed to have AP to see what is going on. And that ment that I had to talk to Janice about this... But wait! I must say what happened before Mushes were selected. I of course picked Hacker Kit and Grenade and took them into my turret (yes, yes - days of Queen of Engine Room have ended...) and than I contacted our Chun saying Her that She should secure them. It was ONLY time when our Chun was actually nice! She thanked me and She indeed secured those after Mushes were selected. She also followed my advice to hide one extinguisher. Good job on that Chun! Too bad that it was only moment when you really did what needed to be done. After that Chun was only relying research and sayed in lab whole time. End of this ship showes how good way of playing Chun is that...</p><p>But let's get back on track! I needed Janny's help as I wanted to have bed. And Janny decided to do something very risky... She decided to actually trust me and help me. From that moment I was always moving betwen two dorms when Janny was moving. And thanks to that I also had easier acces to logs from Bravo Dorm. And Janny with me - we had time and plenty of occasions to compare our ideas, thoughts and opinions about things. We quickly become very good team... I saw that She was doing exacly what good Janice should be doing, and She propably somehow saw that I really tried to investigate things on this ship. And than decision was made by me - Kuan Ti must die. I knew that He was Alpha Mush (BDorm logs and His way of playing AND way he was talking with me - all pointed at Him being Mush in my book). But there were two problems. Firstly is that my reasons, beside BDorm Logs were nothing solid really. And I myself was no better at tresspasing BDorm! This ment I could not really hope for anybody to take me seriously, so I keept my decision to kill KT to myself. Second problem was that I was honestly tooooooooo greedy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> You see... Kuan Ti had good deal of AP and was Tech/Designer... And I wanted to make Him use AP on Nexus before being killed... And since He proposed to do some mutual work in there... How could I refuse? In short - I got converted in Central Corridor by double spiking with Infector, right after I took ration from there. Well... So I am now Mush. You all know what that means for You to become Mush out of sudden. But really important thing here was... How it affected my relation with Janice? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It was so great! Janice unknowingly become my puppet which I could play any way I really wanted <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I still disscused with her! I was still saying that Kuan Ti might be Mush. I tried to look as if I am slowly panicking, and shared more and more information with Janice. It was so beautifull to build up this friendship which was doomed to begin with <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So much beauty in knowing that I will have to put knife at Her back one day <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> OMG! Manipulating Janice into killing Derek just after Jin Su screamed about Kuan Ti and Raluca being Mushes in open chat was pure delight! But please! Do not think bad of Janice!!! We all have our week spots. Maybe my way of influencing Her was just perfect way to play Her? After Derek was slained by Janice, She and I had very long conversation after which She started to loose trust in me... But that was too late. At one moment She said to me "This relation will not end good. I feel that I will die <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">". I only said that I will not allow Her to die <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Of course I could not! How coud I? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> She started to suspect me of being Mush... But it was too late to do anything about it. Derek was dead by Her hand and there was nobody who could reliably kill me or any other mush. And soon... Very soon our relations would improve expotentially <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> Forever! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Very well played indeed Europa. I knew it was right to trust you in the beginning. However, I did not foresee the mush becoming such a major problem on our ship. We were so close and I think the tipping point came when I killed Derek, after you manipulated me like that there was no hope for the ship. The fighter was dead, I was out of AP. BDorm was defaced and 4 mush were on the loose. However you managed to stay cool during it all. Even when Jin was going to scream and tell everyone how you were mush.</p><p>I did start to suspect you because you were eager for me to kill Terrence and Derek even though I did suspect them, once you were willing to let me kill people so easily is when I started to lose trust in you. Played very well my mushy friend. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p>

And actually I found out one that would actually speed up conversions ^^ It would include transfering int Janice since I needed Diplomat for that (Case Fire). But that plan was impossible since JS was too low level Mush to give us Mycelium Spirit. So I had to try my best if I can influence You to the point of killing Derek <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I think that best part of it was that people's attention than have turned from Jin Su's rightfull accusations, into the fact that two people got just killed in one cycle by one person ^^ BUT! But please! Take notice that in both cases I did supported You and Your actions openly in main Chat and tried to make sure that nobody will lay finger on You...</p><p>And here is something for all those who read this - it is about us (Mush Crew) acting like bunch of idiots only to make Ian more and more frustrated with us <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Quick explenation to You - Ian was extremly not nice at some point and started to throw offensive language at Janice. Nothing worthy of report! But just because something is not reportable, it doesn't mean we must like it or accept it without a word... In this case we decided to give Ian what He asked for ^^ He called Janice "stupid retard" from what I remember. Well than... We gave him illusion of retarded crew! Here! See for yourself! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/wNXz0h5.png">Ian and retarded crew...</a></p><p>And here another little frustration for our nice Ian...</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/vpK55kE.png">Those tiny things that You can make...</a></p><p>Title of this AP said it all... First conversation led to our "genious" conclusion that "Chun was dirty so She must be Mush" and we tried to act seriously about this possibility untill Chun Herself said that Chun can not be Mush. Well... Than KT acted like "I didn't knew about that!" and I went with "There is bug that makes Chun mush! I am sure of it!"...

Surprisingly she acted after noticing that Janice stole the hacker kit just from under her nose (Chun dropped it just to pick up apron, which was away, then she asked for apron and was offline for some hours, Janice used that opportunity).<br>Chun ran to Janice and was beating her up, at that time Janice was also offline to heal or escape and so we saw at that time no chance helping Janice than killing Chun. Some mushes with Ap attempted it and failed in the end.<br>Chun posted the log of all people attacking her (Raluca, Stephen, Jin Su).<br>I tried to confirm Raluca with that log xD<br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pic-upload.de/view-29017698/raluca_confirmed.jpg.html">Raluca gets confirmed by beating up Chun</a><br>After Chun noticed to be almost dead, she tried to retreat and that was the perfect opportunity for Jin Su guarding Front corridor and therefore not allowing Chun anymore to reach bridge with janice in it.<br>We couldn't heal Janice because she was holding onto the meditkit.<br>Later Gioele decided to entrap them fully by guarding Central alpha turret.<br>A while after, Ian came online and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pic-upload.de/view-29017751/Ian_looking_for_himself.jpg.html">Ian looks on his own what is going on</a>.</p><p>A while later Raluca and myself finished Pilgred and we decided finally to tell them what really happened with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pic-upload.de/view-29018121/revealings.jpg.html">Mush party thread started by Raluca</a><br>I also explained there shortly who got when converted, so check it out for a better understanding, what was happening <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>
