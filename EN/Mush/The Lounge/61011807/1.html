                <p>I'd like to give a small, bittersweet shout out to <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/12282">this ship</a>. While in the end it didn't make it, it powered through some pretty unlikely odds.</p><p>I was Janice, and the ship already had a rough start with a quarantined Stephen and a suicide Eleesha. We had two people with the pilot skill, but only Roland actually pulled his weight in the two. We managed to sell away one of the mush for a significant sum of oxygen, but our lack of pilots was really hurting us.</p><p>Derek starts a mush hunt where we unanimously agree to relieve Jin Su of his commander status, but alas he was human. My two remaining suspects boil down to the people who have not spoken a word on this ship, Terrence and Ian</p><p>At one point we dropped down to two hull, and I reported a valiant death for Neron, but we managed to repair up to 17 hull. We still had an asteroid hurtling towards us, and I went any it it for 4hp from a turret, and went to sleep hoping that someone would continue my cause.</p><p>No one did. I woke up to 1 hull remaining, but KT went on a frenzy, dismantling items to repair our hull up to 22.</p><p>Alas, in the end our odds were too far stacked against us, and we started to die from oxygen before the ship exploded.</p><p>On the end screen I was greeted to another surprise: Andie wasn't even an alpha, she was converted by my highly trusted man Derek, and the mush were thriving at three alive.</p><br><p>So kudos to the mush, for pulling some good conversions. Derek, your RP was very enjoyable and I had a smile on my face talking to you. Roland, Frieda, Raluca, KT, and anyone else active: great job attempting to pull this ship as far as we could, I enjoyed playing with you all. Mush or human, we made a great team making this ship survive longer than I had believed possible.</p>

                <p>Hello, I was <strong>Derek</strong> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/derek.png" alt=":mush_derek_50:" class="tid_ico">. This ship was semi-active and so screwed that I decided to help the ship as the Mush because rampaging would be too easy to win the game and I really wanted to play for a while.</p><p>I used to play very passively finding the opportunity to win as the Mush and I seem not to perform any Mush tasks in the way that might be looking awkward to humans (such as relaying PILGRED at 0% to find myself dirty). But this time, I made 2 spores on the first day. I simply went for a scooter which was in Bravo Dorm, finding Mush Sample on the way but not picking it up yet. I discreetly washed myself took the Scooter and the Knife that was there (I was a wrestler so I could find an excuse to own the Knife) and on the way, I hid the Knife in Central Corridor (the Knife was there until the end of the game) and brought the Mush Sample to the Lab.</p><p>Somebody was complaining inactive Andie was stealing logistics on the Bridge, so I kicked them out and felt lucky (I didn't know the Bridge had no camera then) that it was pushed into Front Corridor as I could ask the partner, who was Frieda, if we can convert them for Anonymush shield, as there were no living trackers on board. I infected Andie on the way to the Lab, Frieda attached the second spore and stayed dirty in one of the side rooms. I didn't mind if she was found killed, as I could go safe and guarantee Sol from myself. Well, she wasn't found and she went to wash, while I was converting Andie on the next day.</p><p>Since then, I was helping human to win the game. I helped with Antispore Gas to gain trust (totally, there's seemingly only one Mush alive but they want Antispore Gas; brainless humans), as I thought the research didn't affect at all. I didn't refuse to find any other opportunities to convert more people. There was a cristalite planet with a slight chance of getting ill. I sent Frieda to find free spores if available. I tried not to blow my cover at all costs so I didn't risk going there. Frieda made spores so she infected Janice, but that was all. The found a Starmap fragment instead of spores and went back to dorms.</p><p><span class="tid_strike">We</span> Humans had trouble with armor since I woke up. Roland was the only one doing piloting tasks and Jin Su, the other <span class="tid_strike">active</span> non-inactive pilot... well, we didn't know what he was doing but he didn't seem to shoot any hunters throughout the game. Also, he was a gold 4lvl player. Moreover, the next in line to the commander was my partner. It was a great opportunity to make her a commander so she'd be sending missions to me. Normally, I kill suspects without consulting with the crew, but as I was Mush, I invited the most active people to a private conversation, including my partner Frieda and Janice, who didn't hide her disappointment towards Jin Su, and discussed killing the commander. We were under attack and the ship was going to fall if we didn't move away quickly. Frieda didn't mind, Janice accepted my opinion and I murdered Jin Su with bare hands. I didn't get dirty, but took the soap and announced otherwise to be in even more convenient position.</p><p>The further part was boring. I helped Frieda converting Paola as she'd double eaten and dared to say I could be the Mush when I asked for Mage Book (how rude!) I slept dirty in Medlab threatening humans not to enter. Kuan Ti got a disorder, Janice got sick, oxygen was found late, the ship got destroyed and the end.</p>

                <p><strong>Roland</strong> here. I tried investigating the mushes early on but once I realized I was the only pilot I dedicated myself to that and clearly it wasn't enough.</p><p>Firstly I noticed Janice hide the grenade in RBS, I asked her if she had spoken to Chun at all and when she told me she didn't I was ready to kill her(asked that twice), but 1 cycle before I got enough AP she confessed to hiding it, saving her own life. Derek and KT were my other prime suspects afterwards, but with the lack of AP I could not investigate whatsoever. I knew the bridge had no camera, so I thought Andie was definitely a scapegoat for the mush who tried to hide and with Eleesha dead before selection there would be no way to find out. Our Chun was inactive, I don't even know what Jin Su did at all. Anti-mush research didn't start until around 2 days after selection, so it seemed impossible to win.</p><p>There were 2 possibilities, either Andie and another inactive were mushes or the mush were actively working to help the ship, which apparently was the case. Thanks to the active people, sorry for not succeeding in my last hope expedition to the volcano planet.</p>
