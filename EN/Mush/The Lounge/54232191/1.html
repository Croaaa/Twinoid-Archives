                <p>(or, never underestimate a Robotic Frieda)</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9607"></a><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9607" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9607</a> was an interesting ship, one where you could easily lose hope of returning to Sol but we made it without mush.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/kim_jin_su.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_KJS:" class="tid_ico"> Jin Su here. After full ship, I awoke to mayhem. Terrence Mush had thrown a grenade at me, and having dismantled fire extinguishers, had set fire to the dorms before taking off in the Pasiphae. Frieda's quick thinking and the luck of a Robotics Expert starter magebook meant we could upgrade the drone to deal with the fires. Success.</p><p>The other mush was Ian who became suspect after not relaying the antimush research. I tried to shoot him with my blaster points but I instead shot myself in the abdomen giving me a disfunctional liver. Painful.</p><p>After several cycles, even though Ian did redeem himself a little by doing research, he also claimed to be dirty from dealing with the plants then did research before showering. Gioele finished off what I failed to do so one mush down.</p><p>However, Terrence landed and killed Chao who was guarding AB2. We were low on oxygen and he stole some capsules taking off again. Luckily for us, there was a trader offering oxgyen for a hydropot so this trade Paola managed to do. I then moved the ship to abandon Terrence.</p><p>Frieda and Gioele scanned for planets. We managed to do 2 planets and get oxygen to keep us going.</p><p>We had lots of pilots, but only one tech - Hua who was semi-active. We started Pilgred late on, but it was slow going. 7% I think was the last reported progress. Then, in the penultimate cycle, a new trader came, D9C7, offering Pilgred. Hua had gone inactive again and Gioele spent a lot of ap shoving her into storage. Paola had been fixing stuff but we were lucky to feed her a pill for 3ap and a banana to get her clean and up to the bridge for the trade.</p><p>Neron participation finished Automatic Sprinklers at the cycle change and it immediately worked putting out 2 fires straight away.</p><p>There was a lot of inactivity on the ship, as well as some active but silent people. We lost Janice, and others either from starvation or fatal depression. Although I was Leader, and we had the pilots to defend the ship, with only one fire drone (unlike an earlier ship with the [AP] Game of Drones), it wasn't worth trying to survive another day with weekend giving some players some offline excitement - in the end, only 6 of us were alive and it wouldn't have been fair after all their hard work if they were to die from steel plates or fires.</p>
