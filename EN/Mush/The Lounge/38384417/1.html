                <p>Janice here. Was a fun ship aside from a few outliers. Im proud of the way everyone came together to do what needed to be done (with minimal bickering and snapping at each other <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">). For a little while it was looking bleak after Frieda was killed and we got low on O2, but Kuan Ti had the magic touch on the scanner and came through for us. I honestly didn't expect us to last as long as we did.</p><p>Great Joke Jin Su, and you did a great job as commander, I certainly dont think you were an asshole (until someone stole your coffee <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>Pretty much everyone was great and a pleasure to play with. Would be happy to voyage with you again. Thanks for the fun time.</p>

                <p>Man, I knew this ship will go far. <strong>Frieda here.</strong> Yeah, me. It was fun while it lasted, all the confrontations were a good laugh, some responses I didn't expect. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> If someone took it personally well, Sorry, but you are the grumpy one, not me. It's a game, and you can't blame me for playing it a bit differently than you are used to. My take on it that Frieda was a very old, experienced woman, that was hateful and bossy towards people that weren't even close to the level of her intelligence, and that everything had to work her way.</p><p>What a shame that I got killed off like that... On a day tabularix was coming in, while I was doing the best I could with my work. I've stayed for quite some time to see what was happening on the ship afterwards, my death thread was an interesting read.</p><p>So a couple of things I want to address.</p><p><strong>Andie: </strong>You never asked me for my morale. I said my morale was 4, but didnt say whether it was exactly at that point of time. Why didn't you ask for its confirmation in private? I totally missed the question where you asked why it was so low, which was burried in public chat. I never stayed in laboratory longer than It was needed. Question: Do you think that I should have picked apron right at the start at cycle change, and hold onto it for whole cycle while being on the bridge, or stay under camera in lab, let other people advance projects using the thing, and grab apron right before cycle change, to go and use it to eat on the Bridge? That's why I stayed in lab, and not because I needed Ians protection. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Janice:</strong> When you do other people morale calculations, you should also count in the cycles on which people spend on the bed in the same room as you. The +1 bonus. You totally missed that on your calculations, and that was a pivotal point. Maybe you guys would have figured it out that I had 2 panic attacks. Anyway, all you had to do, is to ask in private about it. <br>You were right about me saving some AP after I scanned my 1st planet and ate. I had 5 spare AP, and after I scanned the second planet, it turned out to be 15 zone one. Thats why I said, And I quote "Janice have a go at it. The second planet has 15 zones and I'm not even sure its worth spending energy on it". At that point you had full Ap pool, and you could have found a smaller planet with O2, while I would continue to build my AP pool to maximum, and use it for the next scan. But, instead, you dump all that AP on killing me and then struggling to do the scans. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Why would I say that I'm low on morale, If I'm not trusting anyone on the ship? Why should I confide with Andie, if I knew the rebel base was coming in? Or I knew I could just stay in bed near Janice, which I did. When you guys killed me I had 13 Morale. And I didn't use the cat, so I had everything under control.</p><p>I knew that If I ended up on the mush list, I was going to be the first one to get killed off. But I kinda didn't, did I? This was one of those unique ships, which crew makes it a memorable experience. You all did your jobs, and were active in discussions, got IC'ly involved with me. Too bad it was such a short experience.</p><p>Maybe that one spare Astrophysicist, is what cost you the Eden in the end. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico"></p>

You just have to be willing to accept the natural blowback when that happens.

In fact, I think we were all looking for a semi-defensible reason to stab you so you'd leave us alone.</p><p>You're right, it would've been nice to have another astrophysicist on the ship. That having been said, it also would've been nice to have an active Frieda who wasn't abrasive at every turn. I'd rather it went the way it did than have to deal with that version of Frieda any longer than we did. I was ready to stab you by D2C3...and I think I joined on D2C1.</p><p>*shrugs* up to you how you want to play the game. if you're ok with the result, party on.</p>

                <p>Nanomed, here is why I thought you were mush. You said you were at 4 morale before the +6 signal and I figured that meant that you were now at 10 morale after the signal. I dont consider that an unreasonable assumption. But as you just said you were at 13 morale when you died (13 after signal, +1 in bed in the dorm with me, -1 eating uncooked ration, then killed from what I remember) which meant you really should have been at 7 morale before the signal. I thought there was no way 4 morale before the signal could be true. Before the signal you were present when the TV was used which meant that if you were at 4 before the signal you would have been at 1 on the expo. I didnt believe there was any way that a human would let themselves get down to 1 morale and be reluctant to confide in Andie, or not at least ask me for a comfort. I figured you had not realized that the TV was used before you left the icarus bay and didnt realize that by saying you were at 4 morale before the signal would mean that you had to have been at 1 during the expo due to TV. To me you looked like a mush who was tracking what their morale would have been if human, but forgot to account for the TV. I didn't ask you privately to confirm because I dont like to let people know Im suspicious of them and I expect people to be accurate with what they post in public chat or correct it themselves if what they post is inaccurate. This is a social game, what you say can and will be used against you.</p><p>The fact is if you had been accurate and said you were at 7 morale prior to the signal I would not have been willing to kill you. But when I see someone say something that is obviously not true I get very suspicious. We had a mush that was not doing anything mushy so the main way to catch them was going to be through morale, ap, or hunger. As far as the list goes none of us really believed Eleesha was actually going to print it. She was incompetent and barely communicated. There is no way I will ever trust an Eleesha who on day one says "well there is nothing for me to investigate," then goes and idles in an unsecure corridor and lets herself get spored. To me she seemed like she wanted to get converted from the way she kept idling in FC and RC.</p>

I did not make any/many bad dissuasions really if you are talking about my lack of me wanting to go to a planet I don't know how many more crystline planets we went too after that 4/5. So I was right that we would go to them later. I even went on that damn expo by myself just to please you but you still had to keep being rude and not just bitchy.</p><p>We also did not really struggle finding good planets I mean in the end we went on 15 expos. We just had bad luck 2 or 3 of those crystlines did not give us star pieces.</p><p>I also recall saying even though I did not like the way you spoke to us that you was doing a good job.</p><p>Really in the end too if you would have just talked more to us about the moral thing I don't think we would have killed you maybe the personality thing did make a lot of us upset But to be as active as you was Then not say any thing and not confide in Andie Just really threw up a bunch of red flags. I have been on many ships where mush like to pull the moral thing "oh I need to sleep with Janice because my moral is low"</p>

                <p>When someone says I was at X morale before we got the signal, I assume that to mean X plus the signal is what they are at now. I dont consider that to mean at some point in the past, prior to the signal that their morale was down to X (and then leave out that is was raised more prior to the signal). It was the wrong assumption in this case but I still think it is a reasonable assumption, and I would make it again in future ships. If you had not given out a number that I knew it could not have been when we got the signal I would not have supported killing you. If you mentioned that you were at 7 or 13 in chat and I missed it that is my negligence and Im sorry. But as others have said due to your abrasive and argumentative attitude it was probably only a matter of time before people got tired of arguing with you. And FYI anomaly detector worked well enough to be useful and far better than piston sensor <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As far as Eleesha printing the list I dont think I ever saw her post it chat that she was going to print it until after you were killed. I know Andie had been talking to her privately and Eleesha said she would print it at a certain time. That time came and passed and Eleesha was not responding to private messages. Saying you will do something and actually doing it are separate things. I did not believe Eleesha was actually going to do it.</p><p>I disagree that Jin Su was making bad decisions. The ship wasn't run as a dictatorship. Most things were discussed and the group decided if time permitted. I think he did a fine job.</p>

I wasn't even all that frustrated with you Frieda, I kept my mouth shut though so my inaction might have been a factor in your untimely death.</p><p>Looking forward to a ship like this again.</p>
