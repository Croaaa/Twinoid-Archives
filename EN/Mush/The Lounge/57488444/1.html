                <p>So I was ze fantastic, fabulous, French fashion designer, Baudelaire-quoting misunderstood genius Kuan Ti wiz an heavy accent. Well, until the end of day 6 when I logged in and found out I was now dead Janice, go figure. I may be dead, but at least I'm not dressed in sinister gothic clothes like Raluca.</p><p>Oh, Sergeant Hoganizer, I will not forget you. Those intâ€¦ellectual discussions while searching for the lost Hua do leave an imprint on my mind. I'm sad I could not use my newfound Janicey shrink abilities to bandage your mind after you revealed yourself to me. I'll miss you, hero.</p><p>Andie, Andie. Truly a remarkable case of space rabbits, I see that more clearly now that I'm a shrink, I think you'll have to explain us what exactly were those voices you kept hearing. Hoppers schmoppers, what <em>truly</em> didn't help your mental health was that you turned out to be a not-that-subtle dirty mush in the end. Again, a sad loss.</p><p>Now, before I go back to deadness, I would also like to thank Raluca for her fine gameplay, Janice for her mushy treason, and Jin Su for some RP and a nice chocolate cake. Hope I didn't forget anyone on this nice ship.</p>

                <p>Bonjour LAbare.</p><p>SPACE RABBITS? No, Mr. Kuan Ti, I'm sure they weren't space rabbits. I've been talking to them for <em>years</em>... since college, actually. One of them helped me to decide on my second degree, botany.</p><p>Yes, I was Andie, not sure if I mentioned that, and I decided as I started off this ship I wanted to play Andie a little different then usual. So I decided to have them be the only person on the ship who could hear 'dimension hoppers' - I'll leave it to you guys to decide if they were real!</p><p>As the base for my dimension hoppers I had members of my own casting provide 'voices'. Anything odd that Andie said, they were responding to someone off the ship, one or more members of my own casting. I have to thank them again too! They were wonderful and truly made Andie seem insane.</p><p>Thanks, Averell, for the eggsalad.</p><p>As for the ship, I was so disappointed when I found out I was mush! I'd half expected it. Such a great ship, and it was bound to happen! But I tried my best to take it in stride, and started looking for opportunities to hurt the ship. Sadly I was expected for research and <strong>Frieda</strong> pushed me to do it sooner then I would have wanted for my manipulation. Then hit a huge terrible event in RL (which turned out actually to be a false alarm, <em>thank goodness</em>), and I was half-inactive and half-brain. I'm glad I didn't get killed sooner. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> But I was sadly asleep when I was actually taken out, which is too bad because EVEN MY DEATH HAD RP ELEMENTS THERE.</p><p>EVERYTHING was RP. Derek was RP'ing, Frieda was RP'ing, Gioele was RP'ing, I forget who all was RP'ing but it was awesome! Even after we were selected mush my partner and I continued RP'ing in general channel - and in the mush hunt PM. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I actually saved that mush hunt, since it even resulted in my Andie starting to bawl in gen. chat. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I don't know what else I can say about this ship. It was great, I ghosted it until the end, and I really wish I had gotten to stay on and RP more with you and even maybe drag a few hapless humans back to Sol with a shipful of Mush, that'd be awesome! (I've done it before!)</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Andie</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">What are you talking about they're not there? I'm telling you, he's RIGHT THERE. No, I know you can't see him... but he's talking to me and he's been talking to me for years!... why are you bringing me a straight jacket?</span></span></p>
