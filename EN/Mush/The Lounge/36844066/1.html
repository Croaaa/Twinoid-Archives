                <p><strong>Welcome to a mini-StoryGame. Rules of an SG:<br><br>1. Author (in this case, me) writes a mini chapter of a few paragraphs, ending it at a decision point (DP).<br><br>2. Readers suggest what the protagist should do at that decision point, and roll a 1d100. They are allowed to support an existing suggestion by simply saying "X's suggestion, 1d100."<br><br>3. The highest 1d100 is then written into the next chapter by the author, and repeat from (1).<br><br>I'll now begin with a prologue of my brand new SG, a spin-off of Mush! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Please let me know if you're interested in playing...if there's enough interest, I'll proceed to Chapter 1. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br><br>p.s. feel free to start your own SG. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></strong></p><p><em>= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =<br>= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =</em></p><p><strong><em>BURIED - STORYGAME BY SAGITTAERI</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>PROLOGUE</em></strong></p><p>"Remarkable. Absolutely remarkable!"</p><p>Dr Roseline mutters to herself over and over again as she bustled around the outside of the ancient wreckage, too much in reverie to set foot inside the vine-covered fuselage. For an "old" lady in her 40s, she's kinda hot. Of course, her secret on keeping her body trim is simple: work, work and work in the lab, and forgetting that eating is essential for her survival.</p><p>The doctor lifts her steel cane and taps it on the metal-looking hull a few times.</p><p><strong>Ding, ding!</strong></p><p>She leans towards the wreckage, her ears almost-but-not-quite pressing on the metal exterior of the grey fuselage. It's definitely some sort of transportation vessel. Radiometric dating places it about 1.5 billion years old. A stupendously ancient sentient alien transportation vessel.</p><p>"Oh, beautiful!" she exclaims suddenly and covers her mouth with her hands in excitement. "Its resonance is completely foreign to me - oh, my lord, to be on the cusp of our first extra-terestial-engineering discovery! We must take a sample of this alloy and examine it immediately! Oh, how <em>absolutely remarkable</em>!"</p><p>Yes, she does say that a lot.</p><p>"I've seen a child with more maturity than her right now," chuckle a deep baritone voice behind me.</p><p>I didn't need to turn around to identify the owner of that stupidly manly voice. "Give her a break, Wes," I reply with a smile. Not that I'd ever let him see it. "Just because you're a paragon of maturity, it doesn't mean you should judge."</p><p>He just laughs aloud at my snarky sarcasm. He's not exactly childish. Not all the time, anyway. He's intense as hell when he's on the job, but when he's on a break, you can pretty much count on one or two 'anonymous' pranks all over ground base. For some reason, I'm his favourite target. Maybe he misses having a little brother around or something lame like that. Whatever. Not allowing myself to be easily picked on, I definitely returned the favour a couple of times...although I may have used too much chilli on that last one. His mouth is still a little swollen!</p><p>"<em>Liam!</em> Get over here and help me cut it down!" yells Dr Roseline from somewhere behind the wreckage.</p><p>Surprised by the sudden request, I stumble a little on my way around to her. "Yes, Dr Roseline!" I could hear the stupid prick chuckling behind me at my (very uncommon, I'll have you know) clumsiness. I gave him the finger before disappearing around the corner of the fuselage.</p><p>What the-</p><p>"Dr Roseline-<em>Dr Roseline, stop</em>!" I yell without thinking and ran towards her. "Uh, I mean, please get down from that...the debris. With all due respect, ma'am." She's crazy! Why did she climb up that pile of unstable death trap-looking debris?!</p><p>Oh.</p><p>I followed her gaze. There's some sort of artificial markings on the fuselage. Wow. My own sense of scientific curiosity is fanned ablaze in my chest. She's trying to remove the vines to uncover the rest of the markings. I shake my head, smiling. It's so like her to let curiousity endanger her life constantly. But, who can blame her. If those markings turn out to be symbols, it will be our first real sample of a sentient extra-terrestial language!</p><p>"Please let me handle this, Dr Roseline," I request, a lot calmer this time. "Let me do this - I'm your research assistant, after all."</p><p>To my relief, she hops down from the death trap, onto much safer grass-covered ground. Her child-like excitement is still very much plastered to her face. "Very well, Liam. I'll start collecting samples of the plants surrounding the wreckage, then. Our green house won't be big enough for all the alien botany we discovered on this planet! Oh! Remarkable!"</p><p>Yes, she's right, I thought to myself, as I lifted up a long metal-looking pole from the pile of debris and scrape off the vines with it. This planet is so green and blue. It's so much like Earth, and yet it's nothing like Earth. The air here has perfect atmospheric composition to support Earthly organisms. Moreover, one of our more stupendously interesting finding was that the alien life here has the same carbon-based cellular structures as life on Earth, all the way down to their DNA encoding. And yet, all these flora and fauna are completely alien to us. It's like we have no common ancestors, but yet are made the same way. Even the alien ecology is familiar to us, built around the Darwinistic mechanism of prey and predators.</p><p>Predators. Suddenly remembering something, I turn around. "Dr Roseline! Please take Wes with you!"</p><p>"Oi!" a baritone voice from the other side of the wreckage bark in mock-anger. "No need for you to tell your boss to tell me how to do my job! I'm a very talented security officer, you know!"</p><p>I only laugh in reply. "Well, Wes, so far, I've seen no evidence of-" my breath is suddenly caught in my throat. Then, when I finally find my voice again, I calmly-"<em>OH MY GOD</em>!"</p><p>Dr Roseline and Wes appear from around the corner an instant later, staring at me with puzzlement and worry.</p><p>"Liam, what's wrong?"</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>They both ask me at the same time.</p><p>My jaw hung open. My eyes are transfixed at the markings on the fuselage. But I couldn't reply, so I say nothing. I turn and look at them, with a god-knows-what expression on my face.</p><p>"LIAM, stop it! You're freaking me out!" yells Wes, in a tone one could almost misidentify as 'concern', if one isn't aware of the prank-filled relationship we share. Not waiting for my response, they both hurry towards me.</p><p>Dr Roseline gasps audibly beside me. She must have seen it. Now she, too, is speechless.</p><p>Only soldier boy can speak after looking at what I was - and still am - looking at. "Hey you two, I'm not a scientist or anything...but aren't those markings..."</p><p>"Yes," I interrupt him, continuing to stare at the alien symbols on the side of the fuselage. "But it can't be."</p><p>"It can't be," Dr Rosaline echoes. "But yes."</p><p>A long moment of silence passes through. Eventually, Wes sighs. "Okay, I hate to ruin this romantic sciency moment you two have going. But, what does it mean?"</p><p>"Irrelevant," breathes Dr Rosaline. "The breakthrough here, is that we can read it. It's an ancient alien wreckage, and an ancient alien language, which predates humankind by a billion years...and yet we can read it. We can read it."</p><p>Wes crosses his arms in annoyance. "Okay, yes, I get it, the alien language is in English, which is weird. But, what does it mean? What is a <em>DAEDALUS</em>?"</p>

Oh, oh, <em>boys</em>, I found an opening! Hurry!"</p><p>"Dr Roseline, slow down! Stay behind me and my gun, please."</p><p>"Don't be silly, Lieutenant dear. This is a scientific endeavour, not a warzone. Watch your step, everyone. The floor's thoroughly oxidised."</p><p>"Oxy-what?"</p><p>"She means the floor's completely rusted, Wes. As in, it might crumble beneath your-WHOA-OWCH!!"</p><p>"Liam!"</p><p>"I'm fine, I'm fine, let my arm go. Wes, hang on, my leg's stuck on something. I can't see a damn thing...where's my damn torch?"</p><p>"It fell in that hole, I think. Here, let me...huh? Dr Roseline, where are you going? Doctor, wait, stop! Shit, Liam, wait here, I'll be right back."</p><p>"Wes, don't you dare leave-hey! Ahh, fudge."</p><p>With that, I'm all alone in the eeriely silent darkness. Wait here? As if. That stupid prick can shove it.</p><p>The 1.5 billion years old vessel is almost entirely deteriorated near where we entered from. Shafts of natural light shone through the occasional holes on the vine-covered roofs. However, the deeper we ventured into the fuselage, the darker it became. The first room we were in was large - enough to house a handful of land vehicles, and given the entrance we entered from looked like an outline of a hangar door, perhaps it really was a hangar bay. There were doors leading deeper into the wreckage, but they're all stuck, except for one, which leads into a tiny room with nothing but an elaborate virtual-reality type chair...or what's left of it. Dr Roseline was almost certain that the vine-covered platform in front of it must be an electronic display at some point in the past.</p><p>I was studying it when the ground unexpectedly decide to give way to my left foot. Dr Roseline barely noticed my predicament due to her excitement...at least that's what I tell myself, because the other explanation of why she would've simply walked off is that she doesn't think much of my contribution to science!</p><p>Stretching myself forward, I stick my right arm into the hole Wes gestured at before. Leaning into it as much as I could, my fingertips manages to brush against the bottom of the hole. It's a little sandy, and I'm pretty sure that cold, smooth surface beneath the rough grains of sand is metallic. I yelp as something suddenly scuttles over my hand! Something's alive in that hole! Fudge, no way, I'm not going to be snacked by some extra-terestial vermin!</p><p>My chest thumping, possibly in fear, it took all I have to not snatch my hand back. I take a deep breath and push my body forcefully even closer to the hole until my trapped leg is burning in throbbing pain. "Dammit!" I groan and bite my lip. I'm not waiting to find out what's in store for me, here! I systematically search the bottom of the hole with my hands, and to my relief, my knuckles bumps into a familiar rubber texture. It's my torchlight!</p><p>After clumsily knocking it away a few times, I feel the palm-length rubber tube rolling in between my fingers and my thumb. I exhale slowly before finally lifting it out of the hole. My torchlight is officially fine. "Shit yeah!" I exclaim to myself, laughing a little.</p><p>Relieved that no part of me is in that creepy hole any longer, I switch it on and shone a beam of light on my trapped leg. I wince. Bright red blood is rolling down my lower left leg, over the navy blue explorer suit material! I somehow managed to stab my own calves with a rusted sheet of purple moss-covered alien metal. Great. Just great. Kerry is going to be majorly pissed at me for damaging her precious explorer suit. With the guidance of the torch in my mouth, I manage to free my foot from the tangle of rubber cords beneath the floor.</p><p>It suddenly hits me what I'm looking at: under-the-floor electrical wiring! Reaching in, I move the rubber cables around. The ancient alien's engineering is crazy similar to ours. I don't know why am I surprised...they use the <em>same language</em> as us, for crying out loud. What is the deal with that, anyway? It makes absolutely no sense! According to Kerry just before we entered the wreckage, <em>Daedalus</em> means something like a "good worker", based on a millenia-old Greek mythology.</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>The rubber cords, too, are covered in purple moss. Whatever species this is, it seems to survive on rusted metal and rubber, in a dark and dry environment. How unusual. Without thinking, I pull out my sample kit and scrape a tiny piece of the moss into a sterile sealed container.</p><p>"Liam, your leg!"</p><p>I sigh as I reattach my sample kit to the right side of my belt. "Wes."</p><p>"Seriously, I can't leave you alone, can I? Not even for a minute! You scientist types are all just as bad!"</p><p>"I'm right here, Liutenant dear," Dr Roseline's voice echoes from somewhere behind the soldier. I can't see her due to the darkness.</p><p>"<em>No</em>, I'm serious, you two," snaps Wes. "If you can't stay behind me and follow <em>my</em> instructions, I'm dragging you both out, got it?"</p><p>Dr Roseline mutters a non-committal yes.</p><p>"Liam?"</p><p>I give him a small nod. He's gone into his intense mode, now. No sense in trying to argue. "So," I start as I push myself up. "What's in the next room?"</p><p>The doctor's petit silhouette walks into view. "A long corridor with a few doors. One of them leads into a room that looks remarkably like a kitchen."</p><p>Oww. My left leg hurts a bit. I try not to limp as I move towards the pair. "A mess hall? There's only one reason why a vessel would need one of those!"</p><p>"You got it, Liam dear. This starship is made for long voyages!"</p><p>Wes gestures us both to follow behind him as he leads the way into said corridor. It's pretty much pitch black in here, now, our three torches being the only sources of light. The amount of vegetation has gone down significantly in this portion of the...</p><p>"Starship?" I ask, suddenly noticing Dr Roseline's change in wording.</p><p>"Yes, dear. The shape of the fuselage is inefficient for sea travel, and is terribly non-aerodynamic. And yet, these corridors are built with practicality and efficiency in mind, so it only follows that this vessel was once used for space travel."</p><p>I try to swallow my excitement. Spacefaring aliens 1.5 billion years ago? "Do you think...you know, since they speak English, that maybe they came to Earth at some point?"</p><p>"Perhaps, dear. But, if you're thinking that these extra-terrestials are our ancestors, I'd have to reconsider your position as my research assistant."</p><p>I blink. "What-"</p><p>"It's common knowledge that the English language was first spoken in early medieval England...not any earlier."</p><p>That's <em>so</em> not common knowledge! But I bite my lip before I can say anything.</p><p>"Whoever built this ship, they must have learnt our language after its inception about a millenia ago. Additionally, the reference to the ancient three-millenia old Greek mythology can only mean that this English is definitely <em>our</em> English."</p><p>"But the ship's dated to be-"</p><p>"A billion years old, I know, dear."</p><p>Creepy. What am I supposed to make of this? At Dr Roseline's request, Wes leads us into another hallway, connected to the one we were in before. The air's getting thin over here, and the metallic interior are not as thoroughly rusted. Shining my torch around, I'm getting the idea of how the ship's meant to look like before nature chipped away at it for a billion years. To be honest, it's in surprisingly good condition considering its age.</p>

"It's alive!"</p><p>"Actually," I say slowly. "I don't think it is..."</p><p>Wes snorts. "Right, and you know this from glancing at it for a whole half second."</p><p>"No, I know this because I'm looking at it right now."</p><p>As soon as I said that, my two companions combine the light from their torches with mine. Like a dear caught in headlights, the mysterious object stops moving. It's round. It's metallic. It's floating. And, it has a red glowing orb which looks suspiciously like an eye, staring at us, as if evaluating us.</p><p>"A drone?" asks the soldier.</p><p>"Yes, Lieutenant. Oh my, and I do believe I was wrong," answers Dr Roseline.</p><p>What did she mean? Noticing something, I shine my torch at the wall behind the drone-like object. The entire metallic wall of this section of the hallway has been half-stripped away, but not by decay. It looks like it was purposefully cut out by someone, in perfect triangular-shaped pieces the size of 11-inch pizza slices.</p><p>"Remarkable. Oh my. This drone is sentient. Oh, how remarkable!"</p><p>What? I focus my torch on the drone again. The red orb briefly flickers in my direction. Fudge. It <em>really</em> is an eye? Is it...evaluating me, now? It flickers towards the soldier's hand, and back at me. And then it did it again. Suddenly, I understand it's trying to tell me. "Uh, Wes, put the gun down."</p><p>"What? No."</p><p>"Wes, come on."</p><p>"Are you crazy, it might be armed!"</p><p>Stupid prick. Slowly, I step in between Wes and the drone, keeping my front to it. "It's okay, he's a bit thick-headed and insensitive, but he won't shoot you, promise," I tell it. Suddenly, I wonder if I'm crazy for trying to reassure an alien drone.</p><p>Almost immediately, the drone turns around and flies down the corridor!</p><p>"Shit!" I quickly run after it, despite Wes cursing at me from behind.</p><p>It didn't go very far, however. It's now waiting by one of the many doors in the middle of the corridor. As soon as we arrive, a dull hiss of moving air can be heard coming from behind the door.</p><p>"What's that sound?" I ask no one in particular.</p><p>Dr Roseline shrugs as she leans forward on her knees, out of breath from the short run. She isn't the only one - the air here is really, <em>really</em> painfully thin. "Maybe...something is...leaking?"</p><p>"It's being pressurised," soldier boy chips in suddenly. He turns and looks at our expressions. "What? You both may be super smart scientists, but I've spent more time in space than either one of you. I'm telling you, the room behind this is being pressurised."</p><p>So, the room was kept in vacuum? Why? At that moment, the hissing finally stops, and the door slides open by itself! So there's power left in this wreckage? Of course there is, the drone is still powered, isn't it? Speaking of which, the drone floats into the room, and just as I'm about to follow it, Wes grabs my shoulder and pulls me back. He gives me an angry glare before moving carefully into the room, holding tightly onto his gun. From the corridor, I can see the soldier carefully inspecting every corner of the room with his torch.</p><p>Finally, he gestures for us to enter. "It's safe."</p><p>We don't waste any time. The first thing I see once inside the room are cabinets. One is filled with chemicals in labeled glass jars. The other is filled with an assortment of biological samples. There's a computer terminal with a mini platform next to it attached to a ventilation shaft running up into the ceiling. Two lab coats hung on the wall next to the entrance. Unlike any of the other rooms in this ship, this room is perfectly preserved.</p><p>"It's a Research Laboratory," mutters Dr Roseline breathlessly. "The vacuum...it's to preserve the integrity of this room."</p><p>I nod in agreement. "But, why this room?"</p><p>It's then I catch a light blipping from the corner of my eye. It's from a huge box-shaped machine that occupies a large portion of the room. Curious, I walk towards it. It's the only thing on this ship that's turned on. There are some words inscribed on the side of the machine. I walk closer so I can read it.</p><p><em>CRYOGENICS.</em></p><p>I feel a chill down my spine. A large green button suddenly lights up on the panel in front of me. I have to know what it does. I <em>need</em> to know. Slowly, I reach up and push the glowing button. A hiss of air suddenly escapes noisily from the machine while a coffin-like tray slides out from the front!</p><p>My heart thumps painfully in my chest. Slowly, I lean forward and peek into the coffin.</p><p>"Meow."</p><p>A large brown cat leaps out of the coffin!</p><p>"Shit!" Wes curses and aims his torch at the cat. The cat stares at the soldier for a moment before bounding out of the room. Wes then shines the torch at me accusatively. "Liam, what did you do?"</p><p>Dr Roseline walks up to the machine and examines it curiously. "Oh my...they have a working crogenics technology! This is the most remarkable discovery! Earth will be most happy to reverse engineer this machine!"</p><p>"Dr Roseline, Liam just decrogenised a cat!"</p><p>I look at my feet guiltily. I can't really say anything in my defense. I did push the green button, after all. It was stupendously hypnotic, in my defense.</p><p>"Oh Lieutenant, dear, it's just a cat. Look, according to the display, there's one more we can decrogenise."</p><p>"Don't touch it!" the soldier snaps. "Look, no more decryonising anything, okay? Not until we know what's inside!"</p><p>"Oh, don't be silly, dear. It's just harmless science. Liam, you agree, don't you?"</p><p>"No he doesn't! And besides, this isn't a democracy!"</p><p>"That's right, Lieutenant. This is a scientific expedition, so I'm in charge," Dr Roseline asserts and turns to me. "But I run a democracy. You're the tie breaker, Liam. What should we do?"</p><p>I close my eyes. I want to find the cat. I want to keep exploring the ship. I want find out what's inside the machine. I want to go back to ground base and analyse everything we've gathered so far. There is no shortage of things I want to do. But, I should focus on one thing at a time. What's next?</p>

                <p><strong>CHAPTER 2</strong></p><p>"-pursuit of knowledge is our most important-"</p><p>"-dangerous! Am I seriously the only sane person-"</p><p>"-imperative! It is after all the very reason we're on-"</p><p>"-over here?! Let's at least set up a perimeter-"</p><p>"-this planet! We must research the-"</p><p>"-around the wreckage and wait for backup-"</p><p><em>"Oh for crying out loud, SHUT UP, the both of you!"</em></p><p>That did the trick. They're both now looking at me, a combination of surprise and amusement on their faces. I'm not a short-tempered man. I don't go around shouting at people to 'shut up' even if they deserve it. But, trust me, if you had to listen to these two yapping for 10 minutes with no clear end, you'll understand.</p><p>"I'm not voting with either of you, <em>and</em> I'm voting with both of you," I explain to their expectant faces. I turn to Wes. "Dr Roseline's right - we must know what's inside the Cryo Chamber." Then I turn to Dr Roseline. "But, Wes is also right - we need to be cautious. Let's find out all we can, first, before decryogenising anything. Uh, anything <em>else</em>."</p><p>Soldier boy grits his teeth and throws the doctor one last dirty look. "Whatever, fine."</p><p>Dr Roseline crosses her arms almost haughtily. "Those terms are acceptable to me."</p><p>I feel a chill as these two refuse to look at each other, even after finally reaching a compromise. Jesus, you'd think I'm negotiating a peace treaty between two mafia families, or something. Ignoring them, I carefully inspect the large cryo machine.</p><p>Hmm? I kneel down in front of one of the tube hatches and wipe the thick layer of dust off a faintly glowing surface. My jaw drops open momentarily. But this time, my faculties (and my dignity) recovers a lot quicker. I swallow excitedly. "Uh, Dr Roseline..."</p><p>I feel her bending down beside me. The electronic display I uncovered is flickering a lot, as if it's struggling to stay alive. It's so faint that we almost can't make out the words. '<em>Crew member infected with Mush contagion. Stage: Mature</em>'.</p><p>"A...contagion?" Wes' voice pipes over my head.</p><p>"Oh my, how remarkable...I know we already posited that their English is <em>our</em> English, but to see this...it's absolutely mystifying!"</p><p>Soldier boy strides over to the doctor's other side."The <em>language</em>? Who cares about that, doctor. We can't decryogenise anything else - even <em>I</em> know what a contagion is!"</p><p>However, she only keeps muttering to herself, apparently ignoring Wes entirely. "Mistake in radiometric dating? No, that would invalidate too many good results. Measuring equipment faulty? No, other objects measured fine. Wreckage was tampered with? No, there is no motivation that fits current data. Time travel? No, that would violate too many laws of physics."</p><p>Wes' face contorts into a clear expression of annoyance.</p><p>Reluctantly, I put a comforting hand on his tense shoulder while the doctor continues to ramble. "She literally can't hear you right now, Wes. Not when she's like this. Look, I agree with you on learning more about this, first, so I'm going to walk around the ship and gather more clues-"</p><p>"Out of the question," dismisses soldier boy.</p><p>"Why not? I'll be careful."</p><p>"Liam, just stick close to me, okay? Please?"</p><p>Just as I'm just about to launch into one of our famous arguments, a loud hiss of air suddenly rushes out of the large machine!</p><p>A look of 'oh shit' dawns on Wes' face as we both turn towards it at the same time - Dr Roseline has a sample kit needle stuck inside something within the slide-out coffin! I'm too stunned to say anything, and going by the silence, Wes is, too. Just as we manage to shake off the shock and take a step towards her, however, Dr Roseline pushes the coffin back into the machine without warning. I watch as it gently slides back into the machine, and in the last two inches, a tell-tale sound of a vacuum seal being created can be heard loudly.</p><p>"Doctor, what did you do?" Wes asks, a sense of dread clear in his voice.</p><p>She turns around and shows us a sealed bag. "If there's a contagion on this ship or this planet, we have to study it immediately, don't you think?"</p><p>"But you just decryogenised the...the...<em>the infected</em>!"</p><p>"Relax, Lieutenant, I haven't lost my marbles. I did not activate the thawing process - I took the sample while the subject is still in stasis."</p><p>"So, uh..."</p><p>"She means we're no more likely to be infected now, Wes," I translate for him. However, my mind's on something else. "Doctor, the subject, is it, you know..."</p><p>"Yes Liam," she replies excitedly, apparently understanding what I'm asking. "On every indication, she's a human being with dark and delicate European features. Ohh! I can't wait to move her into a secure clean room and wake her up!"</p><p>A human being...on an apparently 1.5 billion years old starship. I can feel my head spinning a little. How is this possible? I really want to look inside the cryo coffin for myself, but Wes decides now's the time to assert his childish masculinity and threatens to shoot anyone who moves any closer to the machine. Immediately after that, my companions get into yet another argument on what they should and shouldn't do, and who is really in charge of the mission. I roll my eyes at them.</p><p><em>Beep.</em></p><p>A faint beeping sound draws my attention to the research terminal. I look at it curiously. When did it power up? I'm sure it was turned off, before. A blueprint of some sort of building is shown on the bottom left corner of the display. Wait...is that the map of this starship? If it is, then the bridge is only just around the corner!</p><p>I tried navigating the terminal, but there's only one option I'm allowed to choose on the touch display: '<em>INITIATE RESCUSCITATE PROTOCOL</em>'. Nothing else is said about this protocol.</p><p>What should we do, next?</p>

XD This is another big one, a result of having to consolidate two very good suggestions! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></em></p><br><p><strong>CHAPTER 3 - PART A</strong></p><p>Button bad. Button very bad. Button very, very bad-okay you get the idea. Basically, I've learnt my lesson the first time. No way, I'm not accidentally reviving yet another 1.5 billion year-old-</p><p>Creature?</p><p>"Wait a second," I say aloud and turn towards the pair. They are still yapping at each other endlessly. "<em>OII YOU TWO!</em> Listen!" The two of them turn slightly towards me, only barely slowing down their argument. "The cat! The <em>cat!</em>"</p><p>Wes, as usual, doesn't get it. "What about the cat, Liam?"</p><p>"Oh!" Dr Roseline, on the other hand... "Oh my lord! The cat! <em>The cat!</em>"</p><p>"Not this again," Wes exasperates lightly.</p><p>"Liam, you're right! It looked just like an ordinary cat, didn't it?"</p><p>"I really hate it when you two get all science-y."</p><p>"Oh my, Liam, we must retrieve the cat at once!"</p><p>"Yes, Dr Roseline, I agree. Wes, come on, let's go."</p><p>Soldier boy suddenly puts a hand on my shoulder. "Wait," he stops me. "Liam, your leg."</p><p>Shining the beam of my torch downwards, I see what Wes means. My leg is still bleeding, and it's dripping all over the steel-like floor. In fact, from the trail of blood leading in from the corridor, I must have been bleeding for quite some time! No one noticed it earlier thanks to the complete lack of ambient light.</p><p>The doctor gasps loudly. "<em>Liam!</em> Stop that! You're contaminating my artefact!"</p><p>"Your artefact? Oh, you mean this ship. Uh okay, I'll try to find something to bandage the wound," I reply apologetically.</p><p>"Dammit, doctor," Wes snaps in annoyance. "Liam must have lost a whole pint of blood already. Don't you care about that at all? Or do you only care about your discoveries?"</p><p>It's starting again. Soldier boy must really like arguing, although usually he does it with me. I think Dr Roseline pisses him off more than I ever did. "Okay, you two, instead of arguing about my injuries, how about we go into the Medlab and treat it?" I shine my torchlight onto a sign on the wall that says <em>Medlab</em> for emphasis.</p><p>That did the trick. They are both now trying to find this not-very-obvious entrance to the Medlab that the sign on the wall promised.</p><p>"I think someone welded the door shut," Wes says after a moment, drawing our attention to an uneven rectangular-shaped groove in the wall, definitely the size of a door. "Maybe it's part of the vacuum seal of this room."</p><p>"To preserve the cryo machine?" I wonder aloud. "Do you think they knew they were going to be here for a billion years?"</p><p>Dr Roseline shakes her head. "Something's been bothering me. With all the plants, animals and atmosphere all around, how did this wreckage maintain its relatively pristine condition?"</p><p>I nod in agreement. "A billion years of heat, chemical and bio degradation - you'd think it'd be dust by now. Whatever alloy the hull is made of must be quite resistant to, uh, everything."</p><p>The doctor giggles suddenly. "Oh my, if the green groups back on Earth catches wind of this alloy, imagine the outcry."</p><p><em>Beep! Beep!</em></p><p>The basketball-sized spherical drone suddenly made some noises as it whirs out of the room, before turning around and looking at us with its odd red orb of an eye. With all the excitement, I seem to have somehow forgotten about the sentient drone! Knowing that it wants us to follow it, I walk out of the room after it, not even giving Wes a chance to protest.</p><p>Once I'm standing next to the drone in the musty corridor, its red eye flickers towards another door next the Lab's. Huh. I examine the distance between the two doors curiously. The position of the door...if I'm right...</p><p>I lean back into the Lab to stare at the welded Medlab door. Huh. "I think there's another entrance to this Medlab," I tell my companions.</p><p>The door is stuck, like all the other earlier ones. But, being curious on why the drone would want us to enter the Medlab, Wes and I eventually manage to force it open. Unlike the Lab, it wasn't sealed in vacuum, so the room is in a much poorer state. There are two broken medicine cabinets along the left side of the room. A collection of colourful pills and their bottles are scattered all over the ground. There's an odd contraption on the far side of the room, consisting of a long mechanical arm attached to a few sharp and dangerous-looking instruments. Next to this contraption is an uncomfortable-looking cot.</p><p>Suddenly, Wes drags me towards the cot and forces me to sit on it. It's actually a lot more comfortable than it looks.</p><p>"Stay there," soldier boy tells me while he rummages the medicine cabinet. "It'll look really bad on me if you bleed out on my watch."</p><p>"Thanks, you two. It's good to know someone cares."</p><p>Dr Roseline walks over to me at that. At first, I thought maybe she's finally feeling bad about my injury, but instead, she walks right past me to inspect the odd contraption! I can't help but smile a little to myself, even though an ordinary human being should be feeling at least a little hurt. I always found her single-mindedness to science rather charming.</p><p>"Don't move, Liam, this might hurt a little," Wes suddenly says.</p><p>What? Whipping my head back towards my injured leg, I manage to see him pour a liquid from a bottle onto my wound. Instinctively, I pull my leg back, but I was too late - a searing pain spreads throughout my entire leg! I let out a loud groan while biting back a scream.</p>

                <p><strong>CHAPTER 3 - PART B</strong></p><p>Wes sticks a pad of white cotton over my wound and bandages it.</p><p>"<em>What was that?!</em>" I hiss, still biting back a scream semi-successfully. The pain has subsided a little.</p><p>"Ethanol."</p><p>I look at the medicine cabinet and gulp horrifically. "Wes, tell me you didn't use a 1.5 billion years old liquid to disinfect my wound."</p><p>Soldier boy chuckles. "Dude, I'm not crazy. It's from my first aid kit."</p><p>I sigh in relief. "Thank god, I thought-"</p><p>"But the bandage is from the cabinet."</p><p>"<em>Wes</em>!"</p><p>He laughs, continuing to bandage my wound. "Calm down, the ethanol will disinfect your wound, <em>and</em> the bandage. It's fine."</p><p>I look away unhappily and inhale slowly. I know that he's probably right, which in itself is quite unusual. I thought he only knows soldier-y things. Maybe he was trained in First Aid in the army?</p><p>Hmm, there's a small display on the wall next to the contraption Dr Roseline's now inspecting. Beneath that display, there's a platform with a small device sitting on top of it. There are tiny grills on one end of the device, and a few buttons around the middle. When I reach over to grab it, the display on the wall flickers suddenly, as if detecting my presence. With only a portion of the display working, I can barely make out what's on it. However, despite that, I know exactly what it says...but only because I've seen those words before.</p><p>'<em>INITIATE RESUSCITATE PROTOCOL</em>'.</p><p>Odd, why would there be an ability to control the cryo machine from here?</p><p>Ignoring it, I turn over the small device in my hands. One of the buttons has a symbol of a sideways triangle next to two vertical lines. Very much like a play/pause button. I wipe away the dust on the other two buttons. A pair of triangles pointing left, and the other with a pair pointing right. They must be the 'previous' and 'next' buttons. A digital voice recorder? Oh shit, did someone record their voice in this? Unable to contain my curiosity, I push 'play'.</p><p>Static. Damn. I push the 'next' button, once. Nothing happens, so I try it a few more times, only to get the same static. Corrupted because of degradation in the electronics, maybe? Slightly disappointed, I push the 'back' button a few times, this time not really expecting anything.</p><p><em>Bzzzzzz-nearly finished. I'm so close to cracking this cure! The gene expression instigated by Miss Zhong Chun's modified RNA strand is doing exactly what I predicted in the test samples.</em></p><p>I freeze. A female alto voice is coming out of the voice recorder. Wes and Dr Roseline both stop what they're doing and gather around me and the device.</p><p><em>However, I can't manually inject the RNA strand into every infected cell in the human body. What I need is a suitable delivery system, something that can transport the subject's RNA into each fungal-infected-bzzzzzz.</em></p><p>Dammit, static again. I shake the device a few times, as if it'll help with the digital recording. Unsurprisingly, the static persists. So instead, I hit 'next'.</p><p><em>Bzzzzzz-trust anyone. I know he's definitely infected, but what about the others? How do we know they're not infected? Chun's the only one immune after-bzzzzzz.</em></p><p>"Liam, what are you doing? Make it work again!"</p><p>"Wes, shut up!" I hit 'next' again.</p><p><em>Bzzzzzz-wrong with him. What he's saying...it terrifies me. I always thought universe domination is their goal. But...if this is true, then-bzzzzzz.</em></p><p>I hit next a few more times. It's hopeless. The rest are just static. I look up at my companions. "We need to send this back to Kerry - she might be able to retrieve the rest of the audiologs," I tell them.</p><p>Wes hushes me suddenly.</p><p>"Excuse me?"</p><p>He hushes me again, this time grabbing my arm in warning. "Can't you hear that?" he whispers. His brows are tightened, as if he's concentrating on something.</p><p>Curious about it, I shut my eyes and cup my ears with my hands.</p><p><em>...90 percent...91 percent...92 percent...</em></p><p>Some kind of electronic voice. "Wes, I hear it. Something's counting up."</p><p>Soldier boy darts out into the corridor, his gun cocked in his hands. Almost immediately he returns, seething in anger. "It's coming from the Lab!" he declares and glares at me angrily. "What did you do?"</p><p>"What-me? I didn't do anything!" I involuntarily glance at the display next to the odd contraption. It hasn't changed - it still says '<em>INITIATE RESUSCITATE PROTOCOL</em>'. I definitely did not do anything! "Why do you always assume it's me?"</p><p>"Because it's always you, Liam!"</p><p>"Now you're being unreasonable!"</p><p><em>...95 percent...96 percent...98 percent...</em></p><p>Oh my god, what's going to happen the count reaches a hundred? I glance around the room. The drone's still hovering silently in one corner. Oh shit. "It's the drone."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I think the drone's behind this!"</p><p><em>..100 percent.</em></p><p>The three of us couldn't move a muscle. Waiting.</p><p><em>Beep! Doot! Ding! Subject: Miss Zhong Chun. Thawing is complete. Restarting cardiopulmonary systems.</em></p><p>Dr Roseline turns to us, looking as spooked as Wes for the first time in our journey. "Did...the contagion in cryo just..."</p><p>Chun. That name sounds so familiar. Zhong Chun. Wait, isn't that the name in the recording?</p><p>Soldier boy suddenly yanks us both out of the room. "Okay, that's it, we're leaving this ship. We're leaving, now!"</p>

Owww-<em>shit!</em>"</p><p>His gun firmly attached to both his hands, Wes skids to a halt, makes a face I can't identify in the darkness, and runs towards me in a manner where one who doesn't know better might mistakenly describe as 'valiant'. "Are you kidding me?!" He slaps the back of my head and pulls my right arm around his shoulder in one swift movement, his left hand still free to aim his gun.</p><p>Dr Roseline runs past us while urging us to hurry with her. For the first time in my life, I'm seeing her express an emotion for something other than science: fear for her life. It doesn't surprise me, considering this unknown contagion could be the reason this technological marvel of a starship is now nothing but a pile of metal and...other stuff.</p><p>"<em>Ahhhh!</em>"</p><p>The doctor suddenly screams and flies across the floor, slamming into a wall with a loud thud!</p><p>Surprised, Wes and I frantically shine our torches at Dr Roseline's injured body, and then past her, hoping to see who did that. There's a surreal moment of silence as we watch...<em>something</em> crawling slowly in front of us.</p><p>Huge, about half my height taller. Long, so long that I can't see its ends. Furry, colourful and sparse. Razor sharp legs, and so, so, so many legs. Two, four, six, eight, ten, it goes on and on. From the creepy tippity tappity sounds...it's as if there are a hundred legs, all from a single creature. Its head suddenly came into view. Sharp pincer beaks on its mouth. About a million tiny red eyes all over its head.</p><p>Oh, jesus, no.</p><p>"Wes, we have to go."</p><p>Our mouths are all hanging open. I hated centipedes even when they were tiny. Dr Roseline is first to recover - she scrambles her way past us and into the Lab. The creature's huge head pauses in front of us, as if evaluating us.</p><p>"Wes, please."</p><p>Suddenly, the creature rushes towards us! Wes pulls me away from its snapping pincer-mouth...I was only an inch away from becoming insect-food! With my arm still around his shoulder, we run towards the Lab while Wes discharges his weapon behind us repeatedly. He didn't need to aim. It was so large, he can't possibly miss! Oh god, no, this can't be real. This can't be real. Suddenly, soldier boy throws me into the Lab, and just before the door closes all by itself, I can see Wes running towards the giant centipede!</p><p>"<em>Wes!</em>" Finally recovering from my shock, I run towards the door and try to force it open. It won't budge! "Dammit!" I slam the door with both my fists.</p><p>The lab?</p><p>Weren't we...running away from it, before? Slowly, I turn around.</p><p>Dr Roseline is standing at a far corner of the room...staring at a young woman in a green dress in the middle of the room. She's awake. The contagion is awake.</p><p>I swallow nervously. "Hello?"</p><p>No response.</p><p>"Excuse me, miss," I try again, but with hand gestures this time. "Can you understand me?"</p><p>Still no response.</p><p>The doctor slowly tip-toes towards her, stopping when she's directly in front of the contagion. She shines her torch into the woman's eyes. "Pupils are responsive. Maybe...side effect of the cryogenics? Maybe she'll be conscious later?"</p><p>Brain dead, but not really brain dead? Good, that's one less thing to worry about. "It doesn't matter, Dr Roseline. We have to open this door for Wes!"</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"I don't know, we'll think of something!"</p><p>"Maybe it's better if we wait till it's over?"</p><p>"What are you saying-are you listening to yourself right now?! Are you saying we should leave Wes out there, as what, a <em>sacrifice?</em> That's not right, and he would've come back for either one of-"</p><p>"-Liam, I only meant that without an old lady and an invalid holding him back, he has a better chance of killing it. He's carrying a gun, Liam."</p><p>I have no response for that. It's true, we'll only get in the way. I clench my fist. We may be useless now, but it doesn't have to be that way. I look around the lab.</p><p>A few medical-looking scalpels so small that it was probably meant for dissecting research samples. Are they even still sharp?</p><p>1.5 billion year old chemicals in a shelf, a few glass jars, and I think Dr Roseline also has a PhD in Chemistry on top of her Extra Terrestial Archeology one. But, can we trust the chemicals?</p><p>Also, the words <em>'INITIATE RESUSCITATE PROTOCOL'</em> are still printed across the terminal. Strange. Why is that still there, if the contagion is already 'awake'?</p>
