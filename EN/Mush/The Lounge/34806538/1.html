What a round that was... starting off without a co-conspirator, forcing myself into an unmovable, supervised position in the back of the ship, being the only <strong>Technician</strong> on the ship, and trying hard to accomodate the crew and be useful, all while achieving my Mush dreams... <em>Trapper</em> was invaluable in this situation, though it didn't work as well as it could.</p><p>My plan from the start was to convert <em>Jin Su</em> ASAP and have him relay PILGRED, then steer to Sol for me. Ever since Day 3 he had 2 spores on him, by touching Rear Corridor and Alpha Bay 2 shelves, but managed to evade my various traps ever since and completely vanished out of my reach, leaving Hua and Stephen to play spore sponges. (<img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) So near, and yet so far... I found myself grinding my teeth a lot, just praying that Jin Su gets his butt over to Alpha Bay 2 or something so I can jump out of the Engine Room and convert him. It never happened...</p><p>Thinking about it, I could've finished the game much sooner this way, simply burning through my AP and spores to rush PILGRED, then transfering into him, but... at least this DID work out.</p><p>My <em>personal highlights</em> include:</p><p>- Safety precautions.<br>Adamant to <strong>never</strong> be detected as Mush, I placed the Camera into the Engine Room myself, moved strictly like a human would and even maintained a notepad file tracking my morale and AP spendings. I tried to always argue in a human way and never do anything visible and mushy, since I couldn't survive without my co-Mush.</p><p>- Negotiating for the Swedish Sofa.<br>I was desperate for this even before I was <em>Mush</em>, and if I wasn't, I'd have argued for it all the same, but this gave me a massive edge I wouldn't have been able to succeed without. Extracting spores AND doing my job is hard work...</p><p>- Earning Stephen's trust.<br>Stephen was the only player to keep personal contact with me, and seemed to trust me a lot. Seeing as he was confirmed human by Mush tests, this was much to my advantage, since I managed to plot Ian's death with him (although the suspicions were purely his and I really just went along, albeit playing reluctance).</p><p>- Delaying the Mush test.<br>I got on the Tabulatrix list!! I wasted a lot of AP killing Ian, but the pill I popped on the way back gave me a "human" thing to do that I could use to further shove suspicions away from me, arguing that I couldn't have possibly made the trek between Engine Room and Laboratory to kill Ian without popping a +3AP pill on the way (something which I had Stephen testify). Janice came up with a Phagocyte explanation which I couldn't rebuke, although I didn't actually use Phagocyte for that. (I had a full AP gauge and a Scooter instead) Thankfully, the ship then went low on Oxygen because noone scanned planets or did expeditions thanks to all our specialists missing, so that bought me a lot of time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>- Game finale adrenaline rush.<br>When Stephen betrayed Jin Su's exact location, the time to act had come. I sprung to action, and my heart started beating like a drum. (it was really intense!) Pop Phagocyte spore, finish PILGRED, drop iTrackie, grab Scooter, take scenic route to Alpha Dorm to deplete all Movement Points, drop Scooter, punch Eleesha to deplete all Action Points, leaving the body with nothing, pick Transfer skill, transfer into Jin Su, pick up Scooter, run to Bridge... run back to Alpha Dorm to pick up Walkie-Talkie, pop spore, Phagocyte, THEN run to Bridge and type some maniacal cackling in the chat log to announce my victory.</p><p>Wow. That was way more intense than a browser game should be, but also super fun. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Personal <em>low points</em>:</p><p>- Mush tests.<br>Mush tests are awful and sap the fun out of playing as the Mush. Sure, you want to win, but consider all the odds the Mush are against. Anti-Spore Gas and Constipaspore Serum are basically "game over" for a proper Mush takeover, forcing them into petty sabotage and murder. Inescapable, targeted Mush tests not only waste food and resources, but also require no detective work. Bad. Please don't do those again.</p><p>- Jin Su not converting<br>Just one more spore. ONE SPORE! But no, he was in dorms or in the front of the ship 24/7. There's nothing I could do... I spent several hours just regularly refreshing the game, looking out for any movements by Jin Su and any nearby dots on the map, I even jumped out once when Jin Su went for a Pasiphae trek so that I could await his return and spore him... but he was already done by that point. Dammit!</p><p>- Inactive co-Mush.<br>Chao was inactive throughout the game, leaving me to myself, and got more Glory than I did in the end. Ugh. Thanks, Motion Twin.</p><p>- Not that much roleplay.<br>I would've liked more RP on the ship, but there were enough funny and interesting talks, and some interesting Mush suspicion arguments including Stephen and Janice, so it was good enough. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I never got to play out my antisocial trait all that much.</p><p>- Nobody hugging Schr√∂dinger.<br>I went out of my way to infect him and noone even touched him all game. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Let me know what you thought about my play! I've had a decent amount of fun for how stacked the odds were against me, and I think I managed to camouflage myself well. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I hope you enjoyed the game at least as much as I did.</p>
