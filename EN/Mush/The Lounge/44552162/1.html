Or... er... not here. Yet. I'm washt... waiting for you here on that lonely p... planet with Jiminy and Gin Shu's ghosht. It'sh not like we're not having f... fun, watching the cricket play water-polo with whalesh and use dolphins as balls, but I want to come to Eden with you and shee my Shtephen again. I mish you shoooo mush... much. <br><br>Oh, and d... don't let Shanta Girl shteal my beetles... battles... damn it, <strong>bottles</strong> again. If I'm mishing a shingle drip... drop of whishky when you bring me back, you'd better run fasht, 'cause Jiminy will be the shize of a giant mammoth by that time. </span></span></p><p>Right, can I speak normally now ? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> 18 days being <a target="_blank" href="http://i213.photobucket.com/albums/cc306/FinouCat/Frieda_zps5wcrchgi.png">completely drunk</a> all the time, phew, you have no idea how exhausting it is. But I had tremendous fun on that ship, it was one of the greatest RP ship I've ever been on. I'm still so, so mad at that tragic expedition during which Jin Su got lost and died, and I was abandoned because of that stupid bug (no, not the cricket, the other kind of bug). At least I'm still alive and was able to <a target="_blank" href="http://i213.photobucket.com/albums/cc306/FinouCat/Announcement_zpsq0vwcrlp.png">communicate</a> with the ship on the last day, but it's too sad about poor Jin Su...</p><p>It's a shame I didn't get to get more involved in other people's secret motives and plots, so I'm looking forward to hearing what happened behind the scenes. But I just had too much fun being drunk and doing crazy things all the time, like taking a patrol ships to do barrel rolls, hacking the command terminal to <a target="_blank" href="http://i213.photobucket.com/albums/cc306/FinouCat/Drunk%20Frieda%204_zpssirm6uzl.png">spin the Daedalus</a>, pouring rum in the combustion chamber (which, curiously, did keep burning and blowing for a few cycles after that), taking a <a target="_blank" href="http://i213.photobucket.com/albums/cc306/FinouCat/Frieda%202_zpssbohbrlp.png">shower</a> with the cat, or trying to use the <a target="_blank" href="http://i213.photobucket.com/albums/cc306/FinouCat/Drunk%20Frieda%203_zps1gmw0fxo.png">alien bottle opener</a> to open the Magellan liquid map <em>(I still haven't given up. I didn't manage to drink the alien oil because I accidentally spilled it into a fuel tank, but I <strong>will</strong> find out how to drink that liquid map)</em>. Oh, and of course adopting an alien cricket which is growing steadily into a <span class="tid_strike">monster</span> cute giant insect and is keeping me company while I wait for you guys to come and rescue me.</p><p>Gin... Jin, I enjoyed talking to you... and getting you drunk. You truly were a great commander, and you deserved to go to Eden.</p><p>Paola, I would have been no use to you in the rebellion, but I got to admire your leading skills (and your cold heart) during the last days.</p><p>Donaldo... sorry, Rinaldo, we had some words and failed to really reconcile, but I really liked you when you looked like a double orange Pokemon. Oh... wait... maybe that was the alcohol speaking.</p><p>Andie, I haven't forgotten my promise, kiddo. I'm looking forward to teach you how to drink properly, and we'll raise a glass in Jin Su's honour, our drinking buddy.</p><p>Janice, Eleesha... er... I have absolutely no clue what happened between you two, or between you and the Mush, or you and the humans. But apparently even Terrence had no clue about some of the dark things that happened on the Mush side of the force (he had the most beautiful tentacles, though).</p><p>And Stephen, I can't wait to see you again. We had such great times together (but I don't want to make Andie blush, so I won't give any details) and I'm so, so sad to be away from you. Oh, and thank you so much for bringing me Jiminy, that was the best present ever.</p><p>So, now... what really happened on that ship ?</p><br><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Oopsh, I forgot the link.

I wouldn't have been able to do it, if Janny wouldn't have been able to help me her last month on Eden, before they came... the Rebellic fleet which Paola requested and pointed to Eden. They brought Frieda with them, which made us very happy, especially Stephen, he was jumping as high as that monstrous alien cricket Jiminy. They took Janny with them to use her as a sample for producing the cure and which will probably kill her in that process. I can clearly remember when Paola (who is now behaving like a real emperor) spoke to Janny and myself only some hours before we went to Eden, the time where I still was a human. She thought she would have shocked me when she revealed Janny's horrible secret to me, but she didn't know about our strong love and that I knew it already for a long time, where Janny did tell me everything about her and where our love showed that we are able to get over it. Then Paola told me, what she intended to do with Janny, she wanted to let her suffer for her crimes, sacrifice her to save humanity by being a sample... And Janny, my dear Janny, she even admitted to Paola and me that she already intended to sacrifice herself willingly, she did even speak already with Stephen to get shot by the natamy rifle... Oh, I was so shocked. Just before the end everything seemed to fall apart, I was in panic and I NEVER ever wanted to loose my Janny.... I discussed it first calmly, but the cold emperor Paola didn't listen, Then I went wild, I stole the natamy rifle, guarded Janny's room and didn't want anyone to take me my Janny away... Oh, I cried so much... Paola was cold like ice and not touched from that action, at least Chun and Derek, in the end even Stephen showed mercy and therfore... Paola "granted" Janny and me a month of living together.</span></div>

I spoke with Janny in private, I wasn't able to convince her to flee with me, she really wanted to save humanity from the "bad" mushy virus (apart from us normal mushes there is a virus which is turning people into bloodlusty beings). Finally she understood that I really can't accept loosing her, that i needed her... and so she developed a plan. She told me that she was able to connect with the mushes hivemind and that she is even able to send her spirit into it in the moment before she dieing. If I were a mush and able to connect to the mushes hivemind too, we could meet there..and we could be together forever. Of course that was, what I wanted, I agreed instantly to it and with the help vessel Schroedinger, which was infected by Janny I became a mush, just 4 minutes before daychange, I took anonymush and hoped that no human would notice it and just 8 minutes later we returned to Eden.<br>Now I am a mush and even able to communicate with Janny soon, I can't wait to find her now, she is somewhere here in this big hivemind, we still have to do our wedding after all!<br>But I am also a hidden mush and as long as Terrence and Ian are silent - and I will convince them to stay silent- no human knows about me being mush...and when I think about it, it could be that Janny did not only take responsibility for humankind, but also for mushkind. If humanity (and I don't trust especially Paola) will ever try to crush the normal, not bloodlusty mushes, I will be there to avenge them, I am a guardian of the mushes now.</p><p>While at the beginnning of the voyage, I wanted to get the secrets of other crew members to tell a great story about them... lots of things happend and now... I am myself highly involved in a great story, a story full of love, drama, betrayal and hope. Though I can't share it with humankind, it won't be forgotten, because I am hiding this story now in the mushes hivemind.</p><br><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p></span></div>

It happened when you were missing 10 bottles of your good ol' booze at bridge.

                <p>It is my first conversation with Jin Su. For everybody to know - story for my character was that I WAS NOT REAL JANICE! I WAS NOT REAL SHRINK! JANICE DIED IN AN ACCIDENT MADE BY ME! I TOOK HER IDENTITY TO AVOID BEING LYNCHED ON SIGHT - good that Janice and I were so simmilar with our outlook <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> So... This is how it is - I am in no way a Shrink and here contact me Jin Su with mental problems... Perfect! Just WONDERFULL! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em><strong>READ FROM VERY BOTTOM TO TOP FROM NOW ON!!!</strong></em> More will come in soon <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>PART 1</strong><br> <br>JANICE : <br>Oh... That thing. Do not worry Commander. Magnetic Return, unlike Magnetic Net is fully autonomus and I have no power over it. I can only guess that idea was to not allow one person - NERON Administraitor - to get too much power in Her hands... So while I could turn off Magnetic Net out of sudden - should we have one at all, I can not control Magnetic Return. So worry not Commander. Beside Andie will return safely and in one piece. Just wait and see! More faith in Your subbordinates!<br>~1h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>Right. Thank you, Ms. Kent.<br>He draws himself up a little, standing straight. Emotions time's over.<br>Right now, my concern is that the Magnetic Return would require some setting to trigger it, much like the Magnetic Net, and that...disaster might strike and leave us poorly equipped for a re-entry mission. The manuals say very little about it, being that these are hardly standard fittings. Would it be possible for you to check the BIOS?<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>But please... Tell Frieda that hanging around dirty in Rear Corridor does not count for good cover... If She wishes to remain in cover <br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>My skills? I wish they were as good as they should be... Maybe with time they will get better. For now, we all have to do our best. Just that, and nothing less. If You will have any worries Commander... Or will just need to talk... Just contact me and I will do whatever is needed to help. And if I will be unable to help... At least I will not make things worse, and sharing Your concerns with another does help You deal with them... So it still will be better.<br>~1h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>Hrm.<br>Even with all that I have entrusted you, Ms. Kent...I cannot share that information. It's not that I don't trust your secret-keeping if I didn't, I would be a fool to tell you all this. But I fear you may change your behavior around the visitors, possibly subconciously, and humans are quick to pick up on that sort of unease.<br>~2h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>I...<br>Ms. Kent, I cannot help thinking that you are extremely gracious, unduly so, and I feel the urge to contradict several of your arguments.<br>But thank you. You've steadied my nerve, somewhat, and with the condition I'm in that is nothing but a testament to your overwhelming skill.<br>~2h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>And out of curiosity... Have our two guests contacted you maybe? Did they?<br>~2h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Uhh... Commander... I... I don't know... Look... I mean, I am not a Commander here, so I don't know what You should or should NOT to do... But I do know that whatever You will choose, as our commander... You will do so with Your best intention of us - Your crew. And about that truce with Mushes... You did right thing. War and aggresion are never proper solution to problems. Just think... Maybe... Just maybe there are hummans that would prefer to become Mushes? Maybe there are Mushes that attacking hummans only in selfdefence? Just think... They didn't come to us first... It were us who invaded their planets first. Only than they spread and war has started. And it were not Mushes that started killing. You may not know it, but I managed to download some secret documentation from SDF HQ... But never mind that. You are commander. Whether You like it, or not - so put Yourself together. Just think... You faced alone worse odds than You have now. You faced more dangerous situations... With no help, or no hopes for anybody to be at Your side in the end. Now You have us... 14 hummans at Your command... And perhaps... Perhaps for the first time in history a humman commander have 2 mushes at His command. Don't think of this in way of danger... Think of opportunity. And never... NEVER EVER show that You don't know what to do... Remember - Commander ALWAYS know what to do. If he does not - we are all dead. Understand? I will hold Your side... But it is You who must stay strong. And one more thing... Being coward is one thing... Being carefull and logical is another. You were logical. What would You do if Mushes would start killing us? I bet that than You would made a stand, ready to protect us. You are no coward. That is sure. Just put Yourself together... Commander.<br>~3h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>I don't know if setting up the truce was the right thing.<br>...I don't know anything anymore. I'm not only losing my resolve, I'm losing my mind, and I can feel it.<br>And...so. Seeing as you are our trained psychiatric professional, I would like to request your help. Shining a light on these fears shakes me to my core, but if I do not they will swallow me in the darkness.<br>~5h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>I don't deserve to lead you. Not any of you. I've guided you into disaster, on an ill-equipped ship far from any sliver of safety, stranded with a broken engine. I've tried to set up a truce with the mush-the rebels, our own allies, would hang me for that. But I don't...I can't risk being wrong. I cannot see one of my crew lose their life to rampant suspicioun. In that sense, the truce springs from craven cowardice on my part, the fear that I'd fail you, and I might be endangering you more by setting it up. If their wills, their desires, are completely alien to ours, how could I think I could persuade them? Cowardice and arrogance.<br>~5h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>These past few days have been hectic for all of us, and in this time stuffed with crises we must remain iron-willed and not tremble in our resolve, the gallant banners of the future are lined with the small and fearless steps of resistance from the few, the current, the suffering and brave, and I know all this like I know the back of my hand, but I...<br>~6h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>Ms. Kent? I need your help. Urgently.<br>~6h<br>Janice has joined discussion.~6h<br>Jin Su has joined discussion.~6h</p>

                <p><strong>PART 2</strong> - <strong><em>from bottom to top!</em></strong></p><p>JANICE : <br>You are welcomed Commander.<br>moments ago<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>I won't. I won't. Thank you, Ms. Kent.<br>6min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Well... At least that is something. Just don't forget that You don't need to carry burdens alone, all right?<br>17min<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>Takes a deep, shivering breath.<br>I know. I don't accept it, not yet, but I understand it and I know.<br>30min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Who? What? Oh... Right... Right... Sorry Commander... Sorry... If You will make all right decisions... Than You will do everything You could do. Look. If that someone ending up dead would be me... Than I would have no gurges towards You. You have to do what You have to do. We all have to be responsible, don't we? First comes our mission... Later our own life. If you do all right decisions, than I have to say that I can not expect more from You. If even than somebody will have to die, just know that it is NOT YOUR FAULT. Understand? Commander... We are just hummans... Not Gods. We can not control every single thing that is happening... And we don't have power over everything. We have to accept that part. We just have to...<br>33min<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>I-I know, but I...<br>Janice, what if I make all the right decisions and one of you still ends up dead? This is going to come up, I know it is. I want nothing more than to get out of this with every single one of you in good health, but I've gone through years of exploration and I cannot afford to still be so naïve as to think that's possible.<br>And I will face that moment, one day, when there will be nothing I could have done. I...cannot accept this.<br>43min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>And Medkit is in Alpha Dorm according to my AstroPad. So no worries there...<br>49min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>But She did not got killed. You were right in all Your estimations Commander. Should Derek go with... He would attract just more attention of predators. You knew Lt. Andies capabilities... And You just made sure that She will go on mission that will be handled well.<br>50min<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>O-oh god, they are hurt. If just one of those wounds had been deeper-<br>Medkit. Janice, where's the medkit? I need to get down there, well, move us first then get down there. Might have been killed and...<br>57min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>I told You Commander. Andie will return... And She did. Sure, She got hurted in the process, but nothing that good medic could not fix. I can assure You of that Sir.<br>59min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Yes... Those shards, that were once normal people, trying to survive against anything that happened... I will sleep better knowing that You will stand behind us, no matter what "welcome" we will get on our return...<br>~1h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>...We'll see. Six more minutes and we'll see.<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Commander... If You will just take care of Yourself, there will be no harm for You. Look more positivly on our situation. We have been barely scratched by enemy hunters. I and Mr. Archer are working on upgrading our weapons as we speack. You have great, competent crew. And that AI of ours... It will not let anybody to make stupid decisions while You take Your time to relax and take some sleep. I know that, as I programmed it that way. Yes, we do have two Mushes on board, but nobody got murdered yet. I take it as acceptance for Your truce offer. End if we will get lucky, we will find our way to Eden. Mrs. Tomescu is working on PILGRED, so in any way we will be able to return to Sol... Alive. And Lt. Andie is competent eoungh to return unharmed... With compass.<br>~1h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>I'm...I'll...I'm not quite sure what you're getting at.<br>You're people. Of course you'll change. If the results of my actions lead you into trauma, fear, ruthlessness--going through hell and coming out the other side scorched beyond recognition, that will be on my head. And, despite what my appearance would suggest, I am not an utter swine. If some of us are broken along the way, I would be an opportunist and a coward not to protect the shards. Your health, your safety, your well-being, that is the duty I knowingly accepted when I gained captainship of this vessel.<br>~1h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>And-Rinaldo? The man's the spearhead of a private enterprise. He may have some experience with management, but on that level it's bosses of bosses rather than contact with the working man.<br>And there's...something about him. He's too eager for his "goals". I fear he might dash off to any planet and hurry explorations, not worrying about preparation and only concerned with profit. Grinding them down to fit his goals.<br>If Chao was here, I at least could have trusted him not to sacrifice the crew. He always said they were "more fun if you kept them alive". Vicious, underhanded brute of a man. But good to have, if you knew where you had him.<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>And let me ask You a question Commander... What if this journey will change us? What if we will not be same people that we were at moment we did got into ship? What if some of us will be diffrent when we return on Earth? And I don't mean Mushes here. I ment that... Voyages, risk, hard decisions... All that does changes us. What if some of us will change beyond recognision? And not in positive way? Would You still be loyal to us? Would You still try Your best to protect every single one of us?<br>~1h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>Thank you, Ms. Kent. The knowledge that my fears and concerns is crushing me slowly and leading me to lose even more of my function for you is truly a relief.<br>...I'm sorry. You're trying to help.<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>You are worried about Your crew. That is good sight. I would not liked to fly under command of somebody who don't care if some of us might die or not. Just make sure to relax from time to time, ask Gioele to take command every now and than while You will be relaxing... Stress might help You only for short time... In long time it is just destroying You. Remember about that as well.<br>~1h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>Andie being cornered on all sides by growling skinners. Andie mugged for the compass and lost in a maze of crystals. Andie being eaten alive by ravenous insects...<br>That's what it means to captain this vessel. Each success is somewhat mine, and each failure is somewhat mine.<br>~1h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>I have the utmost confidence in them. Sergeant Hogan seems to disagree.<br>And...even with my degree of certainty that the risk is not substantial, the minute he planted the idea in my head I keep getting flashes of it.<br>~1h</p>

So no good story here!<br>15min<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>Let's just say I like good stories. And I would do very much effort for a good story... Ah, what I also wanted to know whether you have a slightly cannibalistic nature if I rethink about yesterday's conversation.<br>18min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Oh... I was just trying to upgrade NERON... But You saw results Yourself... I just made Him seeing me as something fake. Maybe certian things are to be done in slow pace, not too fast as I wanted it to be... And to hug I would use Terrence's drones... They could transmitt those directly to NERON's mainframe... That could work... But to make Drones more huggable... That would be easy actually... We shall see how it will go on in future... And Eleesha... Why are You so interested in Mush?<br>33min<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>Oh, NERON isn't good enough for you..Hm... Then I hope NERON is advancing himself from child to grown-up soon. I wouldn't like to miss that nice story, eh, I mean new level of understanding between humans and machines.<br>40min<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>Let me give you an advice, don't try to manipulate Neron with your hacking skills, maybe you could give him some virtual presents! I would like to see how and wheter that relationship could go on! I only see one problem though I am not sure about whether it is currently a problem for you. It will be difficult to hug each other and other things when he is a computer, but maybe you will find a way... I hope so!<br>43min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>NERON... I don't think NERON is advanced eoungh to develop feelings... Beside NERON is easy to control. I have no trouble doing that at any given time. All I need to do is to... Never mind - that is technical things, and we are talking about feelings. What I mean... I think I was born half century to early... NERON is just first... Prototype... In 50 years who know what we can develop... NERON is more like a child. Sure - it is intelligent. It can love me... But only as child woud love it's mother... But that feeling I got when I sit in front of computer... When I pass with ease another barrier of national security and release secret info onto wildness of universnet! When I feel like whole communal intelligence gathered in single brain is working together with me... I feel that harmony... That cooperation... Like we are separate and unified at same time... GOD! I just love that feeling!<br>44min<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>wow, that is a story! eh, I mean, that is very interesting! do you mean.. NERON? Hm, do you think neron would be able to develop feelings regarding you?<br>50min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>I... I don't remember meeting Terrence in person before we met up here, on Daedalus... I think... He is strange one. I like Him. I also like how He is thinking about current situation. I think that He is one of most healthy thinking man that there is on board. But my feelings... I feel about Him more as an older brother... Yea... That feeling is more rightfull. Definietly nothing more than that. At least for now this is how I do feel about Him...<br>51min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Umm... Actually I did thought about such things... And what I thought was not normal for sure. Ehh... If only computers could feel and live like we do...<br>54min<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>I heard you worked for a long time with Terrence. What feelings do you have regardiong him? does he seem more like a father to you or is it .. another feeling?<br>57min<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>you feel strange? does that mean you haven't thought yet about such things? such a pure girl...<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>That... That is very... Very strange question. Actually I never thought of that really... I guess I... No... That is so stupid... I feel now so silly Eleesha. I don't know if I should confes about THAT! I feel strange when I think of that...<br>~1h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>well, yes: tell me what is your dream partner? which gender, which colour of skin, what of a person shoudl it be, should it have authority, which character and properties that partner has to fulfill?<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Oh... Hug me as much as You need Eleesha. Any more questions You would like to hear an answer for?<br>~1h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>ok, that is fine then. Thx for your answer. Let me hug you gently!<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>As for Mushes on board of ship... Unfortunatly I must let You down here... I am not one of them. This is sad as it would make certian things better for me... Would solve some of my troubles. Very private troubles. But truth is that I am no Mush my dear. I am really myself... Janice Kent that is. Even if not fully myself, as I didn't regained my memories... I am more of myself than I was yesterday. At least I think I know what to do and what to not do. My inner feelings are purely humman. Because I am humman... And some of those feelings are part of my problems. Being Mush would solve that. If I will become Mush at any point though, You have my personal prommise that I will let You know answer on everything that I will be able to answer... For now, You are mistaken Eleesha. I am sorry...<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Yes... I remember that I did prommised You an interview. And I will deliver that for sure. So... As for that coffe... I am a little ashamed of that, but I spend most of first day in after cryo shock... I mean... I lost big parts of my memories, and I didn't got most of them back still... I just stayed in one place in shock, and didn't even knew what was going around of me. So I would not know who took that coffe even if somebody would put it in front of me and forced me to drink it. I am not saying it was, or was not me... I am saying that I have no idea who that was...<br>~1h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>The interview:</p><p>Let me ask you some questions, you promised to do an interview with me. Do you know anything about who took the coffee at day 1? plz share me what you know. and then regarding another intersting matter... You know, there are 2 mushes on board of the daedalus and I would like to found out who... I believe you are one of them. plz tell me about your past and whether you can remember everything. Do you feel alright or is there any other feeling inside of you? if we can find it out, I would proceed the interview with other questions since I am interested about the mushy culture.<br>~1h<br>Janice has joined discussion.~1h<br>Eleesha has joined discussion.~1h</p>

                <p>Hello crew, your poor confused Mush <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Terrence</strong> here. (first time as the roller roboticist!) This ship was amazing and you were all amazing. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I was just a little good-guy Mush, convinced that he was there to prevent the mission from failing, due to a disease that humanity had picked up. This virus would eventually cause them to turn on each other and destroy themselves. And conveniently enough, the Mush fungus was able to prevent the aggressive symptoms from manifesting by regulating brain chemicals, as it does when preventing mental illnesses in humans. Converted last-minute and given a quick, intense education, he awoke ready to convince the crew to allow him to convert them... lest their Eden colony violently burn out before it could truly take hold.</p><p>There was plenty of arguing aboard the ship in those early days, and he feared that it was evidence that the disease was already well set in among the crew. What bothered him was the certainty with which crew members referenced the SDF (which he knew to be corrupt) as being heavily infected with Mush. But if the Mush only wanted to help humanity, how could this be? The SDF is evil, the Mush are beneficial. Does not compute!</p><p>This motive was tough to play because the most sensical narrative I could come up with for it-- required shifting canon a little bit, and other players of course would not be doing that. So it was perhaps inevitable that Terrence eventually discovered that he had been manipulated, the viral plague wasn't real, and that without the hivemind to guide him, he was little more than a human with a really awkward condition. Angst abounded. He remained loyal to his crew to the end, and agreed to help the rebel network as much as he could, once they were ready to attempt retaking Sol. Possibly even get cured himself, as soon as they unlocked the secret.<br><br><strong>Frieda:</strong> I am amazed that you kept the drunken schtick entertaining the entire time you were with us. Absolutely A+.<br><br><strong>Jin Su:</strong> Terrence's confidant (in both directions, at times!) on the ship, super fun to play with. Dudes having a hard time with their repressed emotions, go! A shame that relationship with the lovely Ms. Zhong promptly ended the way you were afraid it would. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"><br><br><em>Jin and Frieda were both lost on the same D18 expo, and quite a bit of wind went out of the ship's sails when that happened. Both were extremely talkative and good at providing RP hooks, so between that and the genuine player grief (losing Jin was legit, but losing Frieda was a bug), things finished out pretty quietly.</em><br><br><strong>"Janice":</strong> Secret betrayer! :O I'm sorry I left you hanging the second half of the ship. I got very involved in some of the other secret stuff (trying to confirm the existence of the virus, trying to prove my own trustworthiness) and Terrence started to get more and more cold toward Janice's true identity the longer time went on, so he stopped communicating in the mush channel entirely. I should have at least tried to get some more juicy conflict out of it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"> Juggling too many plates, I guess.<br><br><strong>Paola:</strong> My nemesis! You were watching Terrence like a <em>hawk</em>, and didn't let him forget how much you disapproved of him. And while most of his overall emotional range (such as he was able to experience) was weighted toward the sad side of things, you actually succeeded in making him lose his temper a couple times. Which was fun. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><br><strong>Eleesha:</strong> Terrence is totally going to rat you out, unless you <em>stop</em> him. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br><br><strong>Andie:</strong> The cutest! Also mutually supported Terrence in the final days after the Tragedy Expo.<br><br><strong>Derek:</strong> You made me laugh a lot with your matchmaking and general embarrassment around the ladies of the ship.<br><br><strong>Raluca:</strong> Taken from us too early. Once I found out what your secret motive was, I was extra sad not to get to see it in action. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br><br><strong>Gioele:</strong> Perfectly snarky. Sorry you got slammed at the end there.<br><br><strong>Stephen:</strong> What drama! :O Was fun to watch whether serious or silly. Even the embarrassingly public PDA with your sweet Frieda... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/omg.png" alt=":omg:" class="tid_ico"><br><br><strong>Chun</strong> We didn't interact much, but Terrence felt awful for you after Jin perished planetside. Maybe a bit responsible.<br><br><strong>Doctor Hua:</strong> Amazing. You made me laugh pretty frequently as well. Glad you were finally able to fit into that TARDIS of yours. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br><br><strong>Kuan Ti, Roland:</strong> Didn't seem to be as actively involved in the RP, possibly because their assigned motives were hard to work with. They still did a good bit of contributing on the ship, though, and I enjoyed the interaction I did have with them <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br><br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Ian:</strong> My fungal partner, dreamy and focused mainly on his plants. Not around very often, but I loved the way you played the weird motive Ian had. Also did a decent bit of healing in those last few days of raining sheet metal. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><br><br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/awake.png" alt=":mush_game_without_sleep_1:" class="tid_ico"> Screenshot album (It's... it's a lot.

                <p>This is your captain speaking.</p><p>Man, this ship. I don't think you could've had more fun with constant stress, failing control over your emotional breakdowns, and eventual death if you tried.<br>That said, and Jin's big crawly heap of issues aside, building support from the crew and attempting to reinforce and fulfill their emotional needs was a big old bucket of fun. All those conspiracies. All those late nights. All that burying your head in your hands and having a good moan over existence.</p><p>Building trust from Paola and debating the mush was a generally good time, coupled with hindsight about arguments I could've used, avenues I could've explored. Seeing the screenshots shared by others, it's also interesting to see peoples' masks shift according to who was addressing them.</p><p>Terrence was a bunch of fun to talk to all ship, becoming the best of emotional detachment bros while at the same time leading an existence that prodded at one of his biggest sore spots--the possibility that he was being suckered and endangering his crew through neglect. Plus passively knowing that if this was the case, he'd eventually have to call for the death of at least one of his crew, leaving them with one less of the people he's devoted himself to protecting and at a standstill in what could've been a diplomatic breakthrough. Jin was not a happy bunny for most of the voyage, is what I'm saying, and just as things started seeming like they were about to wind down he got himself lost and crunched under a stray crumb of mountainside.<br><br>Kinda wish I'd talked to Chun more. As it was, Jin went one week of suppression and caution and teenagerly fussing, one day of exchanging sheepish confessions, and two days of hand-holding and cozy bliss before being smashed by the big ol' rock of narrative interruption.<br><br>Still. Sometimes you're the big hero who gets to lead his teammates back and make glorious speeches while you're at it, sometimes you're the supportive guy who dies for peak dramatic tension. Loved the time I got to spend on the ship, in any case.</p>

                <p>Hello there crew, lovely Ms. Zhong here. Or Chun <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico">, if you prefer.</p><p>Before this ship, I was kinda sceptical of this whole "Co-Op casting ship without murders and sporing." To me, it felt like something without any inherent conflicts and thus something bound to be pretty boring story. So I wasn't about to press ready button and just joined random ship several days before the planned casting. But fate (and loads of inactives and merciless RNG) cut my random ship short just when the ready button was about to be pressed. So I just did it for sake of curiosity. And boy, I didn't regret it for a second!</p><p>Maybe it was because of Artie's motives, maybe because of great role-playing of other players, all the same I had tremendous amount of fun most of the time. And even the parts that weren't exactly funny, were worth it, probably even more. So first of all, I'd like to thank Artie and all my crewmates for that.</p><p>Playing as a Chun was okay, since I have pretty clear picture how I like to play her and my ulterior motives weren't in any real opposition to that. I used them rather as starting square then defining features, as playing utterly crazy characters (which would happen if I really started playing straight that whole "I'm living in a dream, have a prophetic visions of Eternal Fire and you all must follow my Four Teachings or otherwise..." thing) isn't exactly my cup of tea. So I just limited myself to some mild nightmares, several PMs about how the mushes are harbingers of destruction and occasional protests against visiting the cristalite planets.</p><p>But even that went mostly away, when Chun found out she has a feelings for self-doubting and cutely socially awkward Jin Su. It gradually developed in beautiful relationship and I was genuinely sad, when, on rescue expedition, we found Jin Su smashed by the rock. Well, it didn't help, that it was like 3 AM in my timezone at the moment, I just got back after night out, was pretty drunk and felt kinda responsible for the whole thing - if I'd came home sooner, we were planning to use Medlab (just for a movie night and holding hands, of course) while Stephen would go on expedition and Jin Su would probably stay on the Daedalus. On top of that, in the spur of the moment, not being a screeshot kind of person, I quited the personal channel we had with Jin Su after he died. Realizing only minute later it's all probably lost for ever.<br>Oh, and Artie sent me (absolutely lovely, by the way, thanks a lot!) Kobb's picture of Jin Su and Chun holding hands which almost made me cry, after all that. So... well, you have the idea how I felt...</p><p>After this experience, it was pretty easy to play Chun as a shut off and depresive for the remaining three days, buy two more levels just to get a lethergy skill and write few hopeless haikus. I even thought about taking a spacesuit and eject from one of the patrollers, but then deemed it too cruel to the rest of the players.</p><p>So that's it all, in short. I like to think about ships (at least the good ones) as a stories. And every story has some genre - some are action thrillers, some are detective stories, some are horrors, some comedies, the "boring ones" often feels like documentaries. This one was a tragic romance for me. I like to hope that Chun was able to pull through after several weeks, months or years. Or that she finds out it was really all just her dream. But anyway, not every story needs to have a happy ending.</p>

                <p>All right. I see some more people posted, so now I will be able to post more of mine pieces of story ^^ What should go now? How about... Me and Stephen? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> Gioele - You should read that conversation VERY carefully ^^ Stephen was not a saint <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Nor was I <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>However... I must say that this conversation was only one that I had and didn't match my character really. Later I was TOTALLY NOT HAPPY with how I handled my "Secret Motive". So what I choose to do? I choose to make few deliberate "mistakes" that would make people to sniff around me and eventually discover truth <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I am happy to say that it worked out! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But who was Stephen for me? Well... As I said I was NOT real Janice - I was just imposter. Stephen and I were both prisoners some time ago... But He didn't recognized me... While I recognized Him in instant <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong><em>Read from bottom to top!</em></strong></p><p>JANICE : <br>Soo... We can have diffrent opinions on some matters... But remember Stephen. No way I will turn my back on You no matter what will happen during this adventure... Even if in the open it will look that way sometimes. If You will need anything ever - just contact me, and I will make sure to help You.<br>2min<br> <br>STEPHEN : <br>Can I just say that I'm happy you're on my side? Remind me never to cross you! That said, I'm in.<br>7min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>See... When we will return Sol, sooner or later they will find Janice's Body in there... And they will find truth about me, and I will get killed or arrested... Or turn into Mush in prison. Last option is not that bad for me, but first two? Not going to risk! So... I will set Your and mine CryoTube to open 3 days after whole crew will get frozen when we will be on our way back to Sol... Or to Eden. Than we will take care of Janice's Body. Together with You we will surely manage to throw Her out of airlock. I will erase all video from cameras, and will clear BIOS from any remains... And we will go into CryoModule again, so we will wake up only after returning to Sol. Or reaching Eden of course... Oh! And if You will want it - I can make Gioele's CryoTube malfunction and make Him drow on Your own eyes. If You will want that of course. If not... THat is Your call Stephen. So... Will You help me?<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>As for me... You know... I hacked NERON. I wanted to get some info about Mush, SDF, Rebelions... You know... About EVERYTHING that was really going on, and wanted to send it free on internet - people has right to know truth. They are free to do what they want with it, but they have right to know truth. Even if it is ugly... Anyway - to the point... When I hacked NERON I accidentally made our drone to cut off Janice's CryoTube out of power. She drowned on my eyes... It is really funny that I still have nightmares about that, and I still regret that. I killed thousands when I set up Nuclear Powerplant to meltdown in Wagadugu... I should not feel bad about one death... But still, that was unintentional. True accident, when those people in Wagadugu... I knew what it will be like, and still I choose to do so. Heh... I think that I need shrink myself... Anyway... I hid Her body in BIOS. Why? Firstly this is only place where ONLY I have acces to in normal circumpstances. Secondly - it's cooling system will stop Janice's body from rotting. What I would like from You is little help on that matter...<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Bella... I remember Her... She was just next cell to me... You did really great couple together... Man! If only that prison guard would came to work drunken that day, as He used to do on every other day... But no! He decided to put alcohol away right when we were supposed to run away from prison... Tell You what? When we return to Sol I will try to hack few official servers and find info about Her. She might be too old for You now, but at least You will learn what had happened to Her after our escape... And after our departure from our galaxy...<br>~1h<br> <br>STEPHEN : <br>Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you again. And I'll certainly keep your secret. But I... well.... I thought you might be someone else.</p><p>I miss her so much. My sweet, sweet Bella. I mourn her every day. As much as it probably was for the best, I always wonder what it could have been if we had run off together like we talked about. sighs wistfully</p><p>So... what do you need from me? I'll certainly do what I can for you... as long as you stop pretending to be mush. That's just not funny. looks menacingly<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Yes... I am Mush... And You should check on Yourself... I infected You twice. You do as I say, or You get third spore... Nah! I am just joking... Megan Lloyd at Your service... Yes, I was in cell in front of Yours... And it was me who made sure that security protocolls will get delayed on day we together escaped from our prisone... You saved me few times from those primitive brutes... In exchange I made sure that cameras will not manage to film You when You were... Conducting to Your prison buissnes... Best hacker in galaxy at Your service... Just think Stephen... Think again... Gioele took something that You want. You propably will be unable to take it back easily... But... Would it not be tragic if cryomodule would malfunction during our way back to Sol? Would i not be just tragic if Gioele's Cryo Capsule would stop working and made Him drown? Poor Paola... Would need somebody's strong at Her side in that troubled time... Somebody She could depend on... Somebody... Hmm... Like You? How is that Stephen? Oh! Wait... You are going to say everybody who am I really, don't You? In that case I will be put under arrest for Murdering Janice... And Gioele will keep His dauther in His controll... So... Will You help me and I will help You in return? Or will You sell me out? I really wish to help You my dear...<br>~2h<br> <br>STEPHEN : <br>You.... I... are you.... you better not be toying with me. If you are who I think you are, you know better than anyone that I'm capable of keeping a secret. I've held this secret for 23 years so far, though being this close is making it hard to continue...<br>~2h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Right... You still don't remember me... I guess I did really good work to change myself to look just like She did... Stephen... I am NOT Janice... Janice was never in that prison of our. She never ever saw You... And She will never ever see You. But please... Don't tell them that I am not a Janice. I want them think that I am Her... You know how many books I had to read secretly to just act a bit like Her? So hard... So damn hard... Will You keep what we say in total secret? No matter what I will tell You? We always have been good friends Stephen... And we can be still, even on this ship, that is so unwelcoming for us...<br>~3h<br>Stephen has joined discussion.~3h<br>Stephen cannot be reached here, left the room without a walkie talkie....~21h<br> <br>STEPHEN : <br>I need to temporarily disconnect from my comms unit. You can call for me again when you want to pick up our session.<br>~21h<br> <br>STEPHEN : <br>But since we're here and chatting, I can't say I'm all that excited about where I find myself. At least mostly. There's one bright spot that was unexpected, to say the least, but it's a delicate situation. Not something I can just blurt out over comms.</p><p>I'd never met Gioele before. I had no idea he was such an overbearing, demanding, outrageous individual. If I had had a single clue, I'd have never let him take what he did from me. NEVER.<br>~1d<br> <br>STEPHEN : <br>Just that one time? I'm often right.. especially where those damned mush are involved! I always knew my coprisoner was fungal!</p><p>I still can't quite place you, though. I mean, I knew someone helped me but I can't remember who... or why. Did my coprisoner jab me with a spore or something to make me block certain things out?<br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Oh... You are as paranoid as always Stephen! Sometimes You are right... Hehe... Do you remember when You thought that Your cooprisoner was leaking info to guards in exchange for better threatment? You were right that one time... And I just helped You to prove that by downloading secured video from guards cameras... But about Mushes You are wrong. They don't steal memories. In fact... Ehh... Never mind - You are so paranoid that You won't believe untill You would become Mush Yourself. Janice sits down on bed and crosses Her legs So... How did YOU ended up here? Hmm? I mean... After we managed to run away from that Ross154? Do You now start to remember? Or should I tell You full story? Hehe... Man! You have no IDEA how glad I was to see YOU on board here!<br>~1d<br> <br>STEPHEN : <br>There's... something... that keeps tugging at my memory, but I just can't figure out why. I think the mush are stealing memories!<br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Thank You Stephen... Gosh! I have missed You so much! Such a shame that You don't even remember me... Don't You?<br>~1d<br>Stephen has joined discussion.~1d<br>Janice has joined discussion.~1d</p>

                <p>So what happened important than? As I said - I decided that I am not really happy with how my Motive got handled (let's be honest - Stephen would never sold me out in normal situation)... So... How to make Stephen sell me out? How to add a little spice to my character? Why?! Deciding to join Mush freely of course!</p><p>And guess what? IT WORKED PERFECTLY!!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I only regret I didn't hide it from Stephen for two or three more days ^^ But before I joined Mush for good, Jin Su and Paola tried to convince me to NOT join them... Here are their's attempts (normally I would agree with them, but I was going for diffrent goal now after all <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And it actually fitted my personal motive).</p><p><strong><em>Read from bottom to top!</em></strong></p><p>JANICE : <br>I am glad to hear that Commander. I was worried about Her and Your potential reaction. If that is the case... I have no other worries about Her. Well... I will contact You if there will come any need. Or You will contact me Commander.<br>moments ago<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>I will, I suppose, be pleased with them. Their allegiance to the Federation was never the problem; theirblind allegiance was.</p><p>With it being infected by the mush, and us being at war, there's a sociopolitical situation that will have to be rooted out first. But if it all simmers down...I trust the Sub-Lieutenant's moral compass, and while their naïvite can be agonizing, if they're instructed in the less pure workings of the world I trust they will be adequately equipped to sift through the everyday evil they'll be faced with.<br>The SDF did a great deal for them. A strong attachment makes sense. If I asked people to give up what they loved when it turned out its core was rotten, there would never be anyone to set things right. Leaving more off-guard youngsters to be lured in by the sweet surface trappings.<br>Let Sub-Lieutenant Graham return to the SDF if they wish. I will prepare them as much as I can, and watch them chase out its dragons.<br>8min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Thank You Commander. I prommise You that I will try my best, no matter who I will become I do trust that I will still be myself... And I wanted to talka bout Lt. Andie... Or should I say... To ask You a question... What will You do if She will choose to stay loyal to SDF in the end? If She will choose Federation despite all it's wrongdoings?<br>25min<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>I wish I could share in your optimism, Ms. Kent, but while I am an explorer second, I am a military officer first. I have heard the grinding of the propaganda factory, and how easily its offerings could be taken for truth by disoriented masses.<br>Nevertheless...I cannot force you otherwise. Godspeed, Ms. Kent, and I only hope your leap of faith lands you on solid ground.<br>29min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Commander Jin Su. You point out at risks, and I point out at opportunities. You say there is war betwen hummans and mushes - but Terrence said how it really looks like. There is something more in it, and I choose to believe Him. There is no "Wolf" there. Only lack of understanding and misscommunication. And a virus that Terrence warmed us about. If You really think about Mushes to be that dangerous, than why don't You tell Roland and Stephen to kill them both? I am sure they would do that gladly. After all they are "Wolf" that is lurking... And they are open now... Exposed... Such an easy target. I made my decision. And recent situation betwen Stephen, Paola and Gioele is enforcing me in my beliefe that it is good decision. That potential benefits greatly outweight potential risks.<br>~7h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>He tenses as she approaches, entirely motionless as she wraps her arms around him. He doesn't return it. He doesn't address it as something that's happening.<br>Ms. Kent.<br>I am showing the immense risks of your conversion because killing you is not, in fact, an act of practiced ease I can indulge in in any moment, it is a possibility so distant I cannot even see it unless I use binoculars. Aside from the inter-species communal love-in that now makes up our ship, humanity and the mush are at war. We cannot add to their ranks. We cannot leave our best and brightest to happily stumble into the jaws of the wolf.<br>~8h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>I am glad that You do understand Jin... Do not worry... All will be right. In the end... I will be the same good Janice You always knew. As I said... I trust them. And I accept that risk. If You will notice anything wrong with me after conversion - feel free to personally kill me. With my body You will be able to push research farther and perhaps find cure. In both ways I will not regret anything. But it will not come to that Jin.</p><p>And... Commander? Thank You for Your worries. Those showed that You really do care of me, as well as of others... Janice comes to Jin Su and hugs Him gently You are good Captain. Best we could have wished for.<br>~10h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>...I see.<br>The foundation for trust, I need remind you, was rickety and uncertain, based more on an outnumbered enemy's lack of nerve than genuine goodwill. And we need you, Ms. Kent, with your complete ability to focus.<br>I just...Janice, you might be letting yourself in for having your memory wiped, or your brain overwritten, or becoming some murderous soldier further down the line. Do you accept that?<br>~17h<br> <br>JANICE : If they would be malevolent, than we all would be infected untill now. No cameras... No research that would protect us from them... They can infect me whenever they will choose to. They could infect everybody, and we would have no means to stop them really... Face it - Mushes showed to be somebody else that You believed they will be. Beside... You made a truce with them, so You were actually first one to trust them as well... I am just ready to go one steep further than You went. Yes, this is a risk. Yes - this may end up bad. But also possibilities that may be obtained are limitless. If I will not try, I will be unable to look myself into eyes. There is one more thing Commander. I... I am not willing to talk with You about that... Not absolutly openly. I have a problem. Big one. With myself. With what I had done in past... With what I did in not so distant past... You did noticed that there is something wrong with me going on. You saw it earlier. You had to... Becoming one of Mush may help me to cope with that, and ultimatly solve my problem.~17h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>Ms. Kent, in old times people had ventured the possibility of the Earth being a sphere based on knowledge of mathematics, surrounding heavenly bodies and astrophysics, and one exemplary thinker even managed to calculate the cirfumerence of the Earth with remarkable accuracy. There are better ways to find things out than to leap headfirst into a gaping abyss. And I trust you, but your set of priorities and values is entirely different from mine, and my faith in you as a person who makes relatively considered choices does not translate into faith that you know what you're getting yourself into.</p><p>I do not deny you are the best candidate to understand them. Perhaps they'll seize upon this and have you understand them too well. You are one of the most valued members of the crew, and to have you lost to invading forces, if they do indeed turn out malevolent, would be devastating. To all of us. Ms. Kent, I urge you to reconsider.<br>~18h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Oh... You are worried about me Commander... Is that right? You are right in what You are saying. All that is one, big unknown for us. And there is only one way to check it. In old times people didn't knew that Earth was a sfere... Some day there came a men who had courage to risk His own life in order to prove it... He sailed away and made gread discoveries... But He risked His own life to do that. He could as well decide to not do that. That would be safe... I stand in that place now... I can stay as I am... That is safe... But on other hand I can check new lands and possibilities. I know You don't trust Terrence to much. But I do hope You trust me. If You do - than trust me that this is better decision... You want to know what influences becoming Mush will have on humman mind? I am best person on this ship to actually provide that information. And there is no other way to do that than to expirience it by myself, and sharing with You. Beside, as I said - I am best candidate for somebody that will allow better understanding betwen Mushes and Hummanity... If I will become Mush, to fully understand them.<br>~18h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>It's about your intended conversion. I have a few doubts.<br>As I said...I don't know how much we can trust the word of Archer. I'm not sure if he's a liar, but I suspect he may have been misinformed, and whatever his intentions we do not know how the mush affects human hosts long-term. Nothing we have heard of the experiences on Sol has been as positive as the situation Archer presents us with, and it may well have something to do with how he was only converted nary...well, a week ago, to his body.</p><p>I am worried that you'll end up trapped in a blank zombie's body or bent to a malignant force's will. And bear in mind, if this happens, then the patients who rely on you will fall in turn.<br>~18h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>All right... So here we are Commander. What was that You wanted to talk about? Hmm?<br>~18h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>Thank you.<br>~18h<br>Jin Su has joined discussion.~18h<br>Jin Su cannot be reached here, closed the tab.~20h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>...Invite me back whenever you can talk, please. I really do need to see you.<br>~20h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>Ms. Kent, I need to speak to you. Not about me this time; about you.<br>~23h<br>Janice has joined discussion.~23h<br>Jin Su has joined discussion.~23h</p>

                <p>That was Jin Su trying to change my mind <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Now You will see Paola's attempt. Oh! She also had Her own problem there - Gioele and Stephen got their fight about "I am Paola's father" very vocal and open for everybody to see <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> So She was also depressed because of them both, and about my decision <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Please, note my finnal message for Paola!</strong> It was sent AFTER She left comm channel <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> It provides You more RPing motive behind getting converted to Mush. In short - I decided that my "Janice" will not be cold-blooded murderer that was happy to kill real Janice. Insted I decided that my "Janice" will be mantally weak and will be driven creazy from feeling of guilt. That makes becoming a Mush only way to actually NOT go crazy completly. But... Let's get to Paola and Her attempt to change my mind. It was of course failure as thing was decided already by me (reason was simple - better for RPing and more interesting)... Additional result was Paola's Drunk Comms Message, that You can see in Kob's gallery of screens <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong><em>Read from bottom to top!</em></strong></p><br><p>JANICE : <br>Heh... Damn it! Since when I was Janice at all? Stupid... You really think that I am just curious and that is why I do THIS? I keep seeing Her face every time I look into a mirror... I keep seeing Her drowing in CryoTank... Slowly... Painfully... Trying to fight, but unable to escape. All because of me... She returns in every dream I have... I must join Mush, or I will be driven crazy... Not to mention that Stephen alone may be not eoungh to cover up for me... I don't go back to jail. No way... Sooner I will simply kill myself really... I see True Janice dying... I think I am crazy. I need help, and they will hopefully help me... Sorry Paola. Really sorry.<br>25min<br>Paola cannot be reached here, closed the tab.38min<br> <br>PAOLA : <br>I don't want to talk to either of them. I think what I need is a good bottle of whiskey... or eight. Thanks Janice... I'm going to miss you, ya know. You'll sound like Janice after but you wont be her. Especially since we have 3 possibilities of what's going to happen. You'll either end up like Soulton... Comatose and broken... Or you'll end up like Terrence who is either a liar or being manipulated. It's a shame Eleesha is going to lose you. If you do end up... Not Janice... Since we don't know the effects... Then you'll have wasted something genuine... Ah... I can't convince you, though, there's no sense trying. Thanks, I'm going to go raid the old lady now...<br>38min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>And... Paola... If You want it. And remember that You have full right to NOT WANT IT. But if You want it, we can organize meeting with Gioele, Stephen, You and me and talk things over... Hopefully ending this... This mess. Maybe when not comfronted with audience they will be more willing to concentrate on You and not on fighting themselfs? That is just proposision Paola. You may turn it down. And we don't need to hurry things with that either.<br>57min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>I can not tell You who You should trust really. That is something You have to figure out by Yourself. Only thing I can say You is that Stephen was telling truth about You being his biological daughter. I can not tell You why I know it. I... I am sorry... I simply can not. But He was telling truth in that part. As for Your mother. That I do not know. I can say You only that NERON is not capable to record private conversations really, so do not believe Him at this one. But You still do have here good people You can find friendship with... Roland... Kuan Ti... Andie... And Hua. Hua seems to like You more than anybody else of them. Don't You think? Roland want to be helpfull... Maybe He would be better company for You than Your... Umm... Fathers? At least maybe His company could make You forget for a while?<br>59min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Oh... Paola... <em>Janices comes closer to Her and hugs Her gently</em> I am sorry to hear that You feel that way about me. You may start to hate me... Avoid me or straight ignore me if You will need to... I will understand You. But that will not affect that I will take care of You and whole crew. And trust me now, that I will never hurt any of You. No matter who I will be, I will be still myself...</p><p>But as You said... There are more important things going on right now... Janice looks into Paolas eyes, than goes to Her desk and sit downs What they did was terrible. There is no doubt about that. They could have solved that in many other ways really. They could contact Jin about that... They... They acted really stupid. I understand You here. And I agree with You. Please, do not feel bad for not standing any of them now. You have right to be angry. You have right to be sad. Do not run away from those feelings, and do not torment Yourself about that. Honestly I think that You just should rest from all that. I have tried few times show them that... That their conflict about You is not solving anything, and just hurting You. I think that now they both realized that they don't have anything left on this world apart from You. Gioele is a bilioneare... But what use his money do have now? He is just an astrophysicist now, that is able to work harder than others thanks to coffe addiction. And Stephen? He didn't had anything when He entered this ship. They fight for You and Your attention only because You are last thing that they possibly can have. It is not fair - I know. And I am not saying that it makes it right. Because it does not. I am just explaining You why they behave like that. If You will be running away from that - they will simply start to get more and more visible to get Your attention.<br>~1h<br> <br>PAOLA : <br>I... I wanted to talk to you while you're not a monster. I wont be able to trust you the same after that... The Commander said he couldn't convince you and... well... You're dumb... like... Really dumb but I'm not even going to bother trying. Your curiosities are certainly more important than our safety.</p><p>Urgh... Sorry... I'm... I'm going through a lot. As if losing both my father and the guy who rescued me wasn't bad enough, they have the audacity to throw in my mother's death. Trust Stephen... Well... Trusted Stephen to tell the truth... and I know my dad is a terrible person but to do that? I can't believe it... I just can't... And I don't think it'd be a good idea to distract myself by thinking about it... I can't stand looking at either of them now... I can feel the amount of people I trust dwindling faster than I realize. I'm trying to be hopeful but how can I, really?<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Please... Please... Sit down my dear... <em>Janice points out on chair in Her "office"</em> You wanted to talk... Has something happened? I mean... Lot's of things has happened... But...

See You when... Well... See You when we met again Paola.<br>moments ago<br> <br>PAOLA : <br>The truth is painful. Just be thankful that you wont be feeling anything once that mushroom strangles the life out of you. I think we've said enough here. Good luck.<br>5min<br> <br>JANICE : <br><em>She sits still for some time without saying anything, just looking blindly into corner of room.

I will not argue with that. It is after all not that You would cared anyway as I see...<br>7min<br> <br>PAOLA : <br>I don't really care what your reasons are. They're misguided and selfish. I have sacrificed for you and the ship, the commander has sacrificed. Every rebel, soldier, and civilian has sacrificed for you and you can't be bothered to keep your hand out of the cookie jar. <br><em>Sighs.</em><br>Enjoy the time you have because after... You're going to be another problem, another sacrifice...<br><em>Her voice gets lower.</em><br>Another tragedy...<br>22min<br> <br> <br>JANICE : <br>Uhh... You propably were... Drunken back than. Really drunken if You don't even remember reasons. Thank You for Your honesty Paola... And for that You will not try to hurt neither Yourself, nor me. I know that this may be one of last time that we can talk with each other and I can know that You do trust me. But I don't think that because of me You will be in danger. Terrence could have finished us all long time before. No cameras... No research for long time... That would be easy for Him. Too easy to simply ignore. Should they want to destroy us - they had perfect opportunity for all this time. That is for me strongest evidence that He is saying truth... Now, You were honest towards me, so I will be honest with You. Yes... I am very curious of them. I will not denay that. But Paola... That is not only reason I am jumping on that. As a matter of fact, that is not even important reason for me to do that. There are other reasons... Those that You don't want to hear about. Do not worry - I will not mention that. And there is one more reason... I woudl like to keep it for myself. But I will only tell You that it is far from just being curious.<br>36min<br> <br>PAOLA : <br>I honestly don't remember why I made that message... Not going to lie and I'm not going to hurt myself over you I just simply don't want to hurt you. It may seem romantic... What you're planning... But the only thing we know about the mush is that they're very good at infiltration and are currently killing the people we set out to save. You even agreed that things with Terrence's story is fishy yet you still blindly jump at it? Why? Is your curiosity really more important than we are? Than the children back on Sol? If there's any chance that you would lose yourself and who you are and what you stand for... Why would you jump on that? Can't you choose to wait until we've succeeded and have a chance to learn more about the mush on a personal level? I'm wary about Terrence but there's enough there for me to suspect that <strong>HE</strong> believes what he's saying. Janice... I'm asking you to wait. Let us get to Eden first because I promise you once you're turned you will not be Janice... Certainly not to me. Everything you say will be seen as one more step to get closer to my throat. And before you go "This is a chance to create peace" don't... Right now our homes are being destroyed and the people we care about are in danger or already dead. If there are factions in the mush who are sympathetic to us then the worst possible thing they can do is take over people on our quest to save our world and create more tension and issues. A truly friendly mush would just leave Sol and try to contact us after we defeat our invaders and take our world back.<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Hi Paola... Your message... Drunken message made from communcation desk... I know You were reffering it to me... Do You still have trouble accepting my chooice? I... I would like to calm You down a bit... End... End make sure that You will not hurt Yourself because of me. You started to drink... A lot. It must be hard for You...<br>~1h<br>Paola has joined discussion.~1h<br>Janice has joined discussion.~1h</p>

                <p>Puttin' up the Chun+Jin conversations. Was unable to cap the very first and last conversation, so some's gonna be plaintext. (There were also a few conversations that were triggered by comments in genchat, like Chun mentioning her nightmares.)</p><p>Bottom-to-top, then the link.</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> I...see.<br>I cannot, I'm afraid, reassure you that your fears are unfounded. If they were, we would not be in this position. But our infiltrators seem intent on working alongside us, and that is a welcome relief for now. For the moment, the larger cause of concern for crewmembers doing terrible acts would be unchecked paranoia.<br>On that note...I would like to ask you to reassure Mr. Zuccali. He's quieted down significantly since his first outbursts, but his pursuits are still worrying. If you could tell him he is, at least, not in imminent danger, I would be very grateful. ~3h</p><p><strong>Chun :</strong> Oh, thank you for your concerns, Captain!<br>Maybe it's nothing. It started after we woke up from cryo. Dreams, visions, feelings of not being entirely awake even when I am awake. Some are just a distorted flashes, blurred images of something... something I can't really describe. But some are more vivid. And more horrifying.<br>I see some of our crewmemebers... well, not always it's clear who exactly it is, but I know it's our crew... sometimes it's them dying, sometimes they are themselves doing terrible things to others... And there's always the feeling of someone... something being present. Some unseen, faceless creature. I thnik this may be the mush. &lt;shudders&gt; ~4h</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Ms. Zhong?<br>Assuming you don't feel uncomfortable talking about them, I would like to listen to your nightmares. Ms. Kent is generally better-equipped for this sort of thing, but the well-being of my crewmates is my primary concern. ~4h<br>Chun has joined discussion. ~4h<br>Jin Su has joined discussion.</p><p>Chun cannot be reached here, closed the tab. 50min</p><p><strong>Chun :</strong> Also checked the others in the room and seems like sargeant Hogan got himself hurt in the past. But now everyone should be at their best health, ~1h</p><p><strong>Chun :</strong> Yeah, gonna stay here for the night, since the trip left me without any MPs. Thanks for an assistance <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> ~1h</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Will that be all? ~1h</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> It's in Rear Corridor, Chun. My Trakie seems to be factory deficient, not up-to-date with Astropad, and in my haste I neglected to mention it. Apologies. I'll fetch it for you. ~1h</p><p><strong>Chun :</strong> Ehm, Captain? I'd love to look at Sub-Lt.'s injuries, but to actually do something I'd need you to drop that medkit. If it pleases you, sir? ~1h<br>Jin Su has joined discussion. ~1h<br>Jin Su cannot be reached here, closed the tab.</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Ms. Zhong, could you see to the last of the sub-lieutenant's wounds? I patched up the most sizeable damage as they returned from expedition, but I need every last one of us in the best shape we can be. moments ago<br>Chun has joined discussion. 1min<br>Jin Su has joined discussion.</p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/FcvgOEZ.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/FcvgOEZ.png</a></p>

                <p>Continuing on the chronicle of two big goofballs:</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> ...I won't. To be honest, although I'm not sure this'll assuage your fears, I doubt you'd have the option. What once was conspiracies is now all-out war. They'll all know who you are.<br>But I will stand by your side, and I will keep you safe. That I promise. ~2d</p><p><strong>Chun :</strong> True. And we're not alone either. We each have fourteen other people with same experience. Although...<br><em>Shudders.</em><br>... please, Jin Su, promise me you won't leave me alone. I don't want to become a test subject without any real life again. Nor being forced to hide from the world under false identity and run away every time anything goes wrong. ~2d</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> She certainly was. <em>Small smile.</em> Was willing to give up her entire life as it was for a chance to live out her dreams, and we're all the more fortunate for it.<br>It'll just be sixteen years. Comparatively easy, but enough will have changed for the mind to reel. ~2d</p><p><strong>Chun :</strong> Yes, cryogenic freezing is doing strange things with humans and their relationships. I can't even imagine what it had to be for Frieda to wake up thousand years after she went to cryo and find not even all people she knew ead but also whole world changed. I mean, I know she did it voluntarily and could anticipate the consequences, but still... can someone by truly ready for something like this? ~2d</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Mhmm. Ms. Rinaldo may have some trouble re-encountering her Kivanc, too.<br>Members of my family will...well. Hm. I reconciled with the idea of only seeing them seldom, if ever, the moment I went to work in exploration. Nevertheless, knowing they're probably dead stings more than it reasonably ought to. ~2d</p><p><strong>Chun :</strong> Oh, we already were there before the Xyloph-17. Although, I'm wondering how much did everything changed on Sol. I mean, it's sixteen years! I guess, Nils won't be alive anymore. His health was failing even before... ~2d</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Yes, it'd be...interesting, no doubt. Although I think we'd both be busier than regular, once we return. Here we're just trying to ensure our survival, back there it'll be the survival of the whole human race. ~2d</p><p><strong>Chun :</strong> There's plenty of time, for sure. Six days till we are due to return to Sol. And then... our ways don't need to part then. I believe rebel bases are much less cramped then Daedalus and if we'll be able to manage get the whole map to the Eden, we'll have the whole planet for us. ~2d</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Right, yes, no, of course, there's no need to hurry things. And fixing the tanks was no doubt a better use of your energy, leisure being second to survival. ~2d</p><p><strong>Chun :</strong> If it will be this cycle, then I'm worried I sadly won't be able to come. After all that oxygen reservoirs repairs I'm totally exhausted! I don't think I'd have enough energy for... that... even if I were able to drag my feet all the way to the medlab. Which I doubt, now, even the rear corridor or alpha bay seems awfully far to me. ~2d</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Mhmm. Mind, if Seagull heads down for the next expedition, we'd have a...window of opportunity, as it were. ~2d</p><p><strong>Chun :</strong> I'm glad to hear it. I'd hate to be another source of stress for you. That would be... selfish from me.<br>Well, if we'd be able to get some privacy in the future... we could... make use of it. <em>Chun blushes violently.</em> But I'm afraid, it won't be easy with dorms full at all time, Paola on bridge and Stephen and Frieda jealosuly guarding their medlab. <em>She chuckles a bit.</em> ~2d</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> It...yes, well. You're not wrong. It took me a few days to come around to it, but...after a point, the stress became pressing enough that spending more time with you seemed like it'd detract from it, rather than add more.<br>And I wouldn't be...completely against it either. Hrm. If you'd like to, at some point, of course. ~2d</p><p><strong>Chun :</strong> Well, it's not like I want to... I don't know... own you or something. Or that I'd have some... lustful notions in my head. <em>Blushes.</em> Well, concerning the second one I wouldn't be completely against it, but it's not the main or only part of my feelings. I just like to be a lot around you and talk to you and such. So I guess my reaction mirrors this.<br>But I have to confess, I was kinda worried too. That you'll find some kind of relationship unprofessional, inappropriate and... well, just silly. It was hard for me to imagine, that the responsible, dignified and all the time busy Captain would agree with something like this. ~2d</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> If I could say...I'm very relieved that you're reacting this way. I had, er...I ran this moment over in my head a few times, and...well, this was the ideal outcome, anyway.</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> <em>...A shiver runs through him. He smiles.</em> Sleep well, Chun. 3min</p><p><strong>Chun :</strong> Now, I need to get some sleep, but tomorrow we will talk more, if you want.<br><em>She hesitates for a moment, then carefully approaches Jin Su and kisses him softly on lips.</em> Good night, Jin Su. 23min</p><p><strong>Chun :</strong> Oh, yes, I already noticed, that your way of talking with people casually is... not very casual. Peculiar, distinctive, but in its manner... kinda... cute.<br>I like you very much. Only thing I want is to be here for you. And, alternatively, to have someone who's here for me, when it's needed. And I don't mean crew comradeship, healing and cooperation in daily tasks. I'm talking about friendship, support and, maybe in time, when we'll both feeling comfortable about it, some intimacy. I guess, we were more or less doing most of it already, anyway. So there's not much what needs to be changed. And I definitely won't push you into anything you don't want or feel uncomfortable about!<br>Just... be yourself. That's the way I like you, after all.</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> ...Right. <em>He clears his throat.</em> Full disclosure may be advisable.<br>What you're suggesting, or seem to be suggesting, is not an idea entirely foreign to me. I've contemplated the possibility for a few days.<br>Um. <br>A week. <br>Ever since you blushed at me, in fact. If I may describe it as such, it was very, er, sweet.<br>I've been trying to hammer out an acceptable course regarding the ethical ramifications of pursuing this possibility considering the disparity in our positions and my status as commander, and...<em>He swallows.</em> And, frankly, it has made itself apparent that the risks of not doing so are more distressing than the alternative.<br>I've...appreciated your spirit, your willingness to be there for the crew, your discretion and your diligence for some time now.<br>And I'm saying this in a way that isn't unlike a motivational speech because what I'm about to say seems tremendously significant and I don't want the phrasing I use to trivialize that.<br>I'm not...entirely good with interpersonal matters, Chun, not when it comes to managing intimate one-on-one business rather than larger groups. But, er, I like you, a lot, and if you'd be interested in talking and holding hands sometime I would...appreciate it greatly. 26min<br>Jin Su has joined discussion. 39min<br>Jin Su cannot be reached here, closed the tab.</p>

They both got plated, so that's...the reason. 14min<br><br><strong>Chun :</strong> Okay, I'm officially lost in all logs and conversatons in last, like, eight hours. So I'll just trust you, go for the medikit in the Icarus bay, move to the bridge, heal people on my way and then wait in the medlab. Could be? 16min<br><br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Yeah, I'd...yes. We're doing alright, currently. Er. Mr. Rinaldo and Lai will need healing. You could grab the medkit from Icarus Bay, I could...meet you on your way up? 29min<br><br><strong>Chun :</strong> Oh, I'm sorry, I kinda overslept... but, I could be around when you get back from the expedition. And... I'm not sure how it is going, but, ummm, I could also heal you, while being in medlab. 33min<br><br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> That'd...yes. That'd be lovely. ~8h<br><br><strong>Chun :</strong> If you mean like today, I'm afraid, I'm not gonna be around from the second part of sixth cycle to the half or so of the eighth cycle.<br>But I should be back then and even could stay during day change. And! I talked with Stephen a little bit and he told me he's always in the garden with plants for a day change, sometimes leaves medlab for expeditions and if I ask when he's currently awake, he could leave too. So... we could have some... privacy there... if you want... maybe... ~15h<br><br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Mhmm.<br>I'll try to set up a movie night at some point tomorrow. Feels a bit of a farce to get started down the path of a relationship and not spending any additional time with you. ~21h<br><br><strong>Chun :</strong> Oh, that's not your fault. These beds are awfully narrow. I know we have limited space on board but Kuan Ti shouldn't have to save the space on crew comfort. Smaller storages would be much better, we keep everything in corridors anyway. ~1d<br><br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Ah, er, thank you. Apologies about my...relative girth. You could've taken up place next to me, otherwise, but...er, not that is to imply anything, but, yes. ~1d<br><br><strong>Chun :</strong> Now, lets look at those bandages Frieda put on you... <em>Chun looks at the treated injuries and fiddles with bandages and band-aids.</em> Not bad. Not bad at all... for an amateur. Just little bit of this salve here and there... and you should be completely okay. <em>Smiles looking on her work.</em> ~1d<br><br><strong>Chun :</strong> Oh, of course! <em>Chun sits down and makes a place next to her.</em> I can even let you lie down through the cycle change. i had enough of Janice therapies and you could use some moral support too. ~1d<br><br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Chun? I'm here.<br>Could I, er, sit down next to you? ~1d<br><br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> I'd...like that, I think. As soon as I've set the ship in motion, I'll get down. ~1d<br><br><strong>Chun :</strong> Oh, I'd love that! I'm not sure if someone already tried switch on that TV or if it is even working, but we could try.<br>And I could look after your injuries while you are here. I believe Frieda did what she could, but still I'd be much less worried, if I saw them myself. ~1d<br><br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Not a problem in the slightest. And I'll try to remember.<br>...If you'd like, I could come down to a dorm sometime, bring something in the way of food, cart up the alien television. Could try to intercept some old rerun. Possibly hold hands. ~1d<br><br><strong>Chun :</strong> Good. I just wish i could help you raise your morale. You should talk with Andie from time to time. ~1d<br><br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> Right. Er. No need, really, Frieda staunched most of the bleeding. ~1d<br><br><strong>Chun :</strong> Fire is in lab - I can go there instead, but you have it closer, if you would go there. Then we could meet in the front corridor - closer for me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> ~1d<br><br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> ...If the fire's anywhere close to you, could you handle that first? Ship takes priority. ~1d<br><br><strong>Jin Su :</strong> That'd be excellent, yes. ~1d<br><br><strong>Chun :</strong> Thank you, you're the best. <em>Chun smiles gratefully.</em><br>I'm not afraid of war. In war you can at least suppose who are enemies and who are the allies. But the paranoia of living in hiding is the worst feeling I ever felt.<br>I see you're hurt. Are you on the bridge? I could heal you, if you want. ~1d<br><br>(And, for good times and completionism's sake, the friendly all-camaraderie <strong>POKER NIGHT</strong> in which Jin first decided to seek counsel on relationship problems.

And it was a time to conffes to Terrence and Ian about my true identity... Honestly... It was really sad that Terrence decided to just cut our relations like that. It was first moment that I feld uninvited, and certanly unwelcomed on that ship. And that was really not nice feeling.</p><p><strong><em>From bottom to top!</em></strong></p><p>JANICE : <br>I am sorry Terrence. I never wanted Her death. I am not happy with what has happened, and I tried my best to... To be Janice for all of You. Please, do not hate me. I tried to save Her... I really tried. But... I understand that now You might not want to talk with me... Maybe even You do regret helping me... But... No. There is no "but" in here. I will wait for You to take Your time.<br>moments ago<br> <br> TERRENCE : <br>[you did seem a bit different. mostly because you were scattered, unbalanced, confused. but i had never spoken with janice in person... only through text. and talking to someone in person is quite a different thing. i thought maybe that was why. maybe i had misread her. maybe she still needed to shake off the cryosleep.]<br><em>&lt;smell of mingled sadness and amusement&gt;</em> [the fake janice announcement. i... remember that. i thought neron was just being ornery.]<br>...<br>[forgive me if i need some time to deal with this. janice was a dear friend and colleague, even if we never met face to face. i... hope you are comfortable, miss... lloyd? as the conversion completes.]<br><em>&lt;the flow of pheromones from Terrence cuts off rather suddenly.&gt;</em><br>8min<br> <br> JANICE : <br>Now You do know whole truth behind me. I hid Janice's body inside of NERON's BIOS. Cooling will keep Her frozen. And only I got acces there. NERON has been hacked. But it was not easy to fully suppres Him. At begining He noticed that something is wrong and even called me "fake Janice". Also I delayed Eleesha's Interview as I had too little info about Janice's work... Didn't wanted to get... To get caught and executed. Guilty... Feared for Her life... That was this whole time.<br>20min<br> <br> JANICE : <br>Who am I? Megan R. Lloyd... Woman responsible for all major leaks of information from high security SDF servers. Best hacker in known universe... I spied on SDF for long... Long time. I sabotaged any organization that tried to disturm free flow of information... And SDF was biggest offender in all that. I wanted information from NERON about everything I could not find even on top secured SDF servers... I got that info. But at what cost?<br>24min<br> <br> JANICE : <br>But every time I woke up... Every damn time I looked into a mirror... All that I saw was face. Not mine, but Janice's... And it was bringing back memories or Her dying there... Me unable to help Her... And all because I decided to hack NERON for some data... How one can live like that? See how many friends She had and still remain sane? It was impossible for me...<br>27min<br> <br> TERRENCE : <br>[ <em>smell of shock</em> oh... oh.] <br>...<br>[then... who are you?]<br>29min<br> <br> JANICE : <br>Thanksfully Janice and I are very simmilar in our outlook. It was very easy for me to put apropriate makeup. Not thinking too much I checked data about Her and went into CryoModule after it got repaired by Your drone. I knew very little on psychology... You propably noticed my lack of memories... Didn't You? I learned as much as I could... Nobody noticed me being not Janice. I practically become Janice...<br>29min<br> <br> JANICE : <br>She was scared. Didn't knew what was going on and tried to survive as long as possible. Of course I tried to help, but before Your drone arrived to open tube it was all over. Janice Kent was dead. In mids of all that I didn't even realized that ship lunched and there was no way back for me...<br>33min<br> <br> TERRENCE : <br>[take the bed for a bit, if you need it. ]<br>33min<br> <br> JANICE : <br>Terrence... I was never Janice Kent. Janice Kent was woman I killed in an accident. I entered Daedalus as I wanted to extract data from NERON. I had no knowledge that by hacking it I will also cause one of CryoTanks to malfunction. Janice Kent died by drowing herself inside Her tank. I watched Her dying... I saw Her eyes...<br>35min<br> <br> JANICE : <br>Now... That I can deal with my own mental problems... And that You trusted me eoungh to accept me I think I should share with You my history. Terrence... Thank You for this. I feel... Uplifted. Somehow... Very diffrent... But positive... Glad... Yes... I remember feelings. That is good. It is calming. I think... I think I am still myself...<br>36min<br> <br> JANICE : <br>Interesting... Somehow I am more fit to use pheromones, than normal language...<br>41min<br> <br> JANICE : <br>It is done... My mind is becoming clealer now... Yes...<br>41min</p>

                <p>As was said before - I made Post-It Notes that ment to be my own observations about how I do feel when being converted into Mush. At begining I planed to hide them in three separated places. But in the end decided that I will just put them in one place and not hide them at all - this way I made sure that everybody will be able to find them easily <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I just hoped that it will take long eoungh time for some people to find that. I believe it would be more interesting that way. Especially when it comes to Stephen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway - here are my "observations" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong><em>From TOP to BOTTOM!!!</em></strong> - YES, You read it right! From TOP to BOTTOM! So opposite than usually.</p><p>Janice's Selfinfection Research Diary: D6C8. Infection level - 1. Infection occures by diret contact betwen Mush and healthy Humman. Of course there are certian conditions that needs to be met in order for infection to happen in first place - mostly important, Mush must have surplus amount of it's mycelian cells, that are forming active spore. It is commonly assumed that in order to infect, Mush must cause some kind of harm to humman. Most common belief is that Mush comes into contact with humman, and than makes small, unnoticably cut on him. In that way spore gets into humman blod circulation system and infection occures. THIS IS NOT TRUE! Infection occures from something as thrivial as thouch. It does not even need to be direct thouch - even if Mush will put spore on it's victim clothes, spore will automatically find it's way into humman organism and infection begins. Victim will most likely not feel anything out of ordinary. I do know that I got directly infected and thanks to that I know that this little inching that I started to feel few seconds after infection occured is my body's reaction on it. But that is it - no other sights of it. At least no noticable sights. People with hypersensitivity (autism, asperger syndrome for example) would propably took it for mosquito (or it's equivalent) bite. I haven't noticed any mental anomalies from moment I got infected for first time. Everything seems to be quite normal (apart from my depresia that I am having of course - but that is not related to infection).</p><br><p>Janice's Selfinfection Research Diary: D7C8. Infection level - 2. First infection is nearly totally unnoticable for victim. Only person with hypersensitivity (autism, asperger syndrome, etc.) could possibly felt it. Even than it could be just mistaken for mosquitoe bite. As for our psyhology - first spore does not seem to influence it in any level that could alarm victim. But that does not mean there is no influence at all. Influence is very subtle, but noticable during dreaming phase. After getting spiked for the first time, I could not sleep peacefully at night. And when I managed to get some sleep, I dreamed about fungus covering pieces of old bread. Now I got spiked for second time. This is largely diffrent than first time in that it is actually very much felt. It does not hurt though - it just gives me that feeling of unsatisfied need, that is common for addictions. In same time I can very clearly feel slight adrenaline burst and irrational fear. Though I am not sure if those are effect of me knowing what is happening, or of direct results of what is happening. I can be sure only about feeing of unsatisfied need to be caused by second infection. As for physical alerts - there is none of those. It is almost as first spore changes our organism in such a way, that it becomes very tollerant for next spores. I am not a biologist, but I am sure that our immunity system is changed by first spore, in order to NOT fight fungal infection. Also I am guessing that THIS is part where Chun's immunity system is so unique - it does not allow to be changed in first place, so it fights off fungal intrusion. Also some other people claimed to get fungal allergy after being directly spored - that would indicate that some people have more resistant to changes immunity systems than others. But none of them can rival Chun's immunity system. That is sure. Ehh... This is my last entry as pure humman being. With third spore I will become one of Mush... And with it I hope that my sucidal thinging will vanish away. I try to stay strong</p><br><p>Janice's Selfinfection Research Diary: D8C1. Infection level - completed. Third infection is unlike anything else. Physical pain is nothing when we compare it to sudden opening of all those new channels of communication. They gives You joy... Peace... Calm... Things were never so calm for me. First time since I woken up from CryoModule I don't have to think about killing myself. First time I see how sensles that decision would have been. I can now not only hear and see... I can also sense pheromones that others are emmiting. And supressing NERON's sensors was as easy as ABC for me. I can feel strange movement inside of my body. I assume that fungal grow is now increased expotentially and soon, very soon my whole body will be taken over by it. When it comes to my mind... As I said - I don't seem to be affected by my depresion. Yet I can feel other emotions. It is as Terrence described - we remain ourselfs in the end. Maybe not completly, but mainly. One noticable diffrence I have noticed for example is that I start to dislike water... I can not even stand thinking about it. I will observe myself and will write down each and single observation for any potential researcher.</p>

                <p>So... I was liar for everybody! Not only I was NOT real Janice, but also I was Mush and not everybody knew of that from moment I got infected. But there was one person that I didn't lied to <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> Well... At least I didn't wanted to lie to... That person was of course... Elemele (or Eleesha - if You preffer it that way).</p><p>Here is how I told Her about being a Mush. Also one more important note - in my personal opinion RPing Mush as emotionless is rather boring. I decided that my Janice even as Mush will be full of emotions, feelings and fears. But that it was sometimes hard for Her to show it, as Her behavior was cut off from emotional state - in other ways every moment She did showed emotions with Her behavior - that was due to being socially trained being rather than just becouse of having emotions. Even than there were things that simply could not happened - for example crying or blushing out of being shy - those simply didn't happened no matter how much "Janice" would like to... Anyway - here goes story!</p><p><strong><em>From bottom to top!!!</em></strong></p><p>ELEESHA : <br>Ir was much to read, but yes, I enjoyed it and I am relieved. you wrote donw that you are staying mainly the same..that si also what you told me!<br>50min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Yes... I wrote that diary... So now there You can see everything... Point by point what was happening. Did You enjoyed lecture Elemele?<br>57min<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>It's your research diary... I can read what happens with you after each infection...<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Did You Elemele? Are they that interesting? What have You found in them Elemele?<br>~1h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>Oh... I wanted to load fuel and found interesting post-its<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>So You don't hate me now? <em>Janice gets surrprised expression</em> You mean... That I am... You don't... Thank You Elemele... <em>She strongly huggs into Eleesha and for long time it seems that Eleesha's words simply do not come into Her perception. Only after few minutes She sits down on flour, in front of Eleesha and starts to slowly answer Her worries</em> That... That is not true... Not all of it at least... It is not that as it looks for hummans... It is not the same... I am Mush Elemele. Yet I still do love You. We don't suffer from mental illneses... We don't cry from mental trauma, sadness or happines... But still we do feel those feelings... We do feel friendship... We do feel love. We may be unable to express it that strongly as hummans do, but that does not changes fact that we do love... <em>Janice slowly kisses Eleesha's lip</em>s You see? Nothing has changed here... Nothing at all... Not in that regard... So please Elemele... Don't... Don't be sad... And don't worry...<br>~1h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>J..J..Janny... I...I..I...We did speak about it.. Do you remember? I told you I would be interested about the mushes...you know, it is a nice thing actually for me to know a mush that good, but.... Janny, you became a very precious person to me, I love you! And... I don't knwo whether mushes can feel in the same way like humans... Can they still crie in pain? Laugh with joy? I heard they never died of depression, they must be... well I won't say that you are a monster, but you are at least different from a human now! What should happen with us now? Just when I thought I found true love, Janny! <br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>I... I don't know what to say... But I can't lie to You. Now... <em>Janice looks away from Eleesha</em> Now You will propably call me a monster... Just like some of those who know already... <em>She gatheres Her courage to look again into Eleesha's face</em><br>~1h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br><em>Eleesha gets pale-faced and remains shocked with a tensed body.</em><br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>I... <em>Janice looks up into Eleesha's eyes</em> I am... <em>Janice stops for some time, She has sad face, like She would be ready to cry, yet no drops are comming from Her eyes for some reason. Finnaly with "silent" voice She admits</em> I am Mush...<br>~1h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>I...of course! <em>Eleesha is hugging Janny and holding her strongly. Their breasts are pressing against each other.</em> Are you feeling bad, Janny? What's the matter?<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Elemele... It is not about Super Soap... It is about me... <em>Janices colapses to Her knees and puts Her look into flour</em> W... Will You love me no matter what Elemele?<br>~2h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>you have still a spore on you, Janny, You don't want me to lick it up, right? right?<br>~2h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>You... don't tell me... you didn't su ethe super soap...<br>~2h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Oh... No! Stop! Elemele... You can't lick my blood...<em>Janice suddenly "jumps" away from Eleesha</em> I... I... I am sorry... I... I don't know what to say. I have no idea how to start it... I am affraid. So affraid... <em>Janice looks straight into Eleesha's eyes</em><br>~2h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Cuddle? Sure... I like to cuddle with You Elemele...<em>Janice gigled a bit, and after that She lied down right next to Eleesha and hugged Her strongly</em> Mmm... Youa re so warm and soft...<br>~2h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>Oh, that scratch, I see blood on you! <em>Eleesha is licking it away<br>~2h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>Elemele awakes from Janny's kiss</em> OH, Janny, I am glad, you look fine! come to me, let's cuddle a bit!<br>~2h<br> <br>JANICE : <br><em>Janice is comming into Dorm, She has few scratches, but other wise She is looking fine and healthy. She comes just next to Eleesha's Bed. Than She bows down to Her and gently kisses Her forehead</em>d I am back Elemele... And I am fine as You can see... Mostly fine that is. How are You? Are You okey?<br>~4h<br>Eleesha has joined discussion.~4h<br>Janice has joined discussion.</p>

Sorry how that research turned out.</p><p>Ms Zhang - I am sorry that your romance was cut short. I should have checked in with you more often. I hope you are well.</p>

I myself tried to write the most stuff in main chat, most secrets I only had with Janny, but since these secrets were mostly regarding her person or regarding both of us, I didn't want to share them to protect us of course.</p><p>But some things could also have handled a bit better regarding revealings of secrets, for example Paola did inform me and Janny about Janny's destiny only 2 hours before end of ship! It should have happened much earlier, only the person who were active at that time could contribute then, when I did my best to change that cruel destiny. It shoudl have happened AT LEAST one day before departure, such a big secret and its consequences had to handled in 2 hours, well, I think I managed it. But other people probably also would have like to contribute and to expand it!</p><p>Also there were 2 occasions on the ship where I tried to establish interesting RP-events, but which both were rejected of certain people, it was still a great ship, but let me show where things could have been even better in my eyes.</p><p>1) I don't know on which occasion, but it was revealed to public that Stephen was Paola's real father AND Gioele did probably murder Paola's mother. (around early middle of ship)<br>Such great stuff! How was it handled? Paola just didn't want to speak to Stephen and Gioele anymore, didn't want to find out the truth and only wanted to forget everything. Ok, she also got drunk afterwards, that was a nice RPing. But then it was over!... Noone did speak very much about it for rest of the ship. What a shame!...<br>I wanted to do a trial regarding whether Gioele did realy murdered Paola's mother with every person involved and with defenders and witnesses, I thought it would be a really nice event where much people could contribute and funny converations could have happened!<br>But Jin only showed his authority and wanted us to stop it, he supported the position of Paola to not dig into it, the relationships between them should just be as normal crewmates.</p><p>2) My wedding preparations! (around middle/end of ship) I wanted to marry my beloved Janny and I gave every crew member a task. Some people showed their support here and I think if we would have hold the wedding, it would have been much fun! Instead Paola and Jin did sabotage it! They brought up excuses so I shouldn't do the wedding, which made me unhappy. As revenge I duct-tape Jin Su at least... I expected it could have something to do with secret motives or because both of them knew Janny's horrible secret ( I knew it already at that point). But I said they shoudl contact me in private to discuss with me problems if there are problems. Noone did contact me afterwards and so the wedding was just out of consideration. Very sad for me I must say!</p><p>And it strenghtened my will to rebel against the authorities of this ship from time to time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>\o/ I'd like to thank the academy.</p><p>Yeah, it's a tricksy thing. Paola didn't seem to want to dig around in the family thing much in her arc, and it's pretty difficult to make anything of it if the centerpiece character doesn't want to be involved. This is another thing that could've benefited from more OOC conversations. I wasn't sure if her player didn't want to play that part out, or if it was just too touchy a subject for the character at that time and could've been returned to. Felt like there was an untapped drama vein at the end of it.</p><p>It didn't go under completely, either. After the revelation Gioele spiralled into a mechanical, depressive funk that Jin spent a few days goading him out of, and I think there were continued talks between Gio and Paola.<br>It did go into more of a lockdown than the juicy drama potential suggested, which was a real shame. Feels like there ought to be a sweet spot between blocking the conversational paths off entirely and going over personal events in public, which the characters involved might not want to encourage.</p><p>I don't think we blocked the wedding path off entirely, though. Looking back over the logs, Jin offered excuses for why it shouldn't have been a wedding (due to secret backstage plans and whatnot), but said there wasn't any reason for why we couldn't have a celebration. Just no vows or officiating.</p><p>I expected you to suggest a rehearsal dinner, or engagement hootenanny, or just proceed with the party minus the ceremony, but your next response seemed to be to call off the whole thing. Which threw me a little. Jin wasn't about to go out of his way to cater to Eleesha, though, so all in all it was just a bump on the road.</p>

Reason was simple - Paola made Her move just moments before I opened new chat. It was litelary like that She opened new chat with me and Elemele while I opened one for me and Stephen... Just didn't invited Him as I noticed that something is going on and decided to check it first. I am still not sure what would be better - this what happened or Stephen solution (assuming He would accept that). I planed to write three letters in Post-It Notes. One for Elemele, one for STEPHEN! And one for whole ship (there would be also one more for everybody that that one would be OOC). To be honest I still feel strange that I was part of ship that made it to Eden, but had no RFS finished...

Whoever it was, they've been there for a loooooooong time. The sound of the door gave Paola a startle and she turned with a growl as Janice entered. She could hear NERON calling for her death. Paola glanced at Jin Su, her eyes begging for permission. The two exchanged some words and Paola decided to speak.</em><br>You're not Janice Kent. Ms. Kent is a victim, Ms. Kelley. Figuring out your reasons are useless but the captain seems interested. I don't know what's worse, you being an actual monster or us finding out you were a monster before the conversion.<br>~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>Tell us everything that led up to this body being stored in the locker, the reason for our genuine psychiatrist's murder, the reason for your attempts to impersonate her, whether you had any motives you haven't told us about in allowing yourself to be converted, why you allowed us to find Ms. Kent's corpse, and any reasons for why you think you should not be exposed and executed. You may appeal to our morality and sense of practicality, but the latter will probably yield better results.<br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Because what Neron? Because they will learn? Don't worry! You are just a machine. Nothing bad will happen to You... Oh! Wait... You simply hate me so much, don't You? Nevermind. They will learn here and now <em>Janice-notJanice takes Her iTrackie, pushes few buttons and turn off Neron's voice</em> Ahh... That is much better. Not that I have anything by Him, but I am affraid that we could not get civilised conversation with Him asking You to kill me over and over again... <em>She takes some time while looking into Paola's eyes</em> You do agree with NERON, don't You? This will be long day I think... <em>Janice-notJanice sits down on flour, putting Her back against jammed doors</em> Fell free to call me Janice or Mrs. Kent... I also got used to that. Let me guess... You are interested who is lying inside of BIOS, right? Or do You already know who it is? <em>She takes her hand into hairs, and removes hair locker, setting them free.

                <p><strong><em>From bottom to top!</em> PART 2</strong></p><p>PAOLA : <br><em>Again Paola shook her head. She felt relieved the captain wasn't falling for it, either.</em><br>Bullshit. This place is sparking like a thunder storm every couple hours. You expect me to believe that the one time NERON tried to pulse a room was the time it couldn't? Also don't give me that "Mush feel things", shit. Terrence tried the same thing. You're master infiltrators... Speaking of which. After you selfishly took control over another person after you "unintentionally" caused her death for the sake of "information", why fight so hard to become a mush? You know what I think?<br><em>Paola took a step closer but pulled herself back in restraint.</em><br>I think you're just here for the chaos. Destroy as much as you can because you can.<br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br><em>Janice-notJanice shook Her head, Her face took sad expresion, Her eyes looked like She would start to cry... Yet there were no drops from Her eyes</em> NERON turned off Janice's CryoTube from power in order to have eoungh energy to create electrick spike in Nexus... To kill me. But it didn't worked for him... <em>She stands up and comes close to wires attached to wall</em> They were... Somebody decided to reinforce isolation, so it didn't worked. I still lived, despite small fire breaking out... Which I extingushed quickly... Than... <em>She hold Her breath and looks at Jin Su's face</em> You really think that I have no emotions? That Mush don't feel anything? You are sooo wrong... <em>She again sat down on floor</em> I remember every single bit of what happened next... Every single bit...<br>~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>Aha.<br>And I presume, once you discovered a corpse, your reaction was not to do the regular human thing and alert the rest of the movers, or even escape the scene of the crime, your reaction was to steal the clothes' off her cold body and disguise yourself as her, a panicked task requiring extensive impromptu hair dying. <br>Which you didn't have any time to prepare. Because of course it was all an accident.<br>You'll forgive my skepticism.<br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Ehh... That was my plan. To simply find what I wanted, grab it and than escape as soon as I was done... But NERON resisted, so I tried to hack it harder. At some point it decided to draw energy from cryomodule. <em>Janice-notJanice pushes few more buttons on Her iTrackie and monitors show now another video record - this time it is even earlier one - whole crew is being transported into Daedalus in CryoTubes, suddenly there is some shaking and few CryoTubes falls from vehicle. They are sturdy and don't breake, but workers in hurry do not take too much attention on which tube was in which place. Stephen's tube is put in place where Janice's tube was, and opposite.</em> Now... Let me explain. Place of each and every tube in CryoModule was put into NERON's memory long before they were loaded even on ship. In other words - NERON got plan of Your possision based on how it was supposed to be, not on how it actually got AFTER those workers didn't bothered to put You in same order. Obviously they didn't had idea about that being important... Or maybe they wanted to get out of space station before it becomes warzone? Not matter now. What matters is that Stephen ended up in place where should be Janice. And Janice was where Stephen should be. But that is not all... There is litelary no mention about Stephen in NERON's database. For NERON that one tube was empty. Keep that in mind please. You might want to know why they did it that way, and not just put sensors into tubes. Answer is thrivial... Somebody wanted to not spend too much money... <em>Janice-notJanice looks at Paola</em> Yes. Only two CryoTubes had actually sensors installed. Gioele's and Paola's. Now... As I told You, NERON resisted my hacks, but it was only a matter of time. And He knew it! <em>Janice-notJanice looks at NERON's big eye in NERON's Core</em> You knew that You could not stop me NERON, so You decided to kill me with electrick spike. But where to find power for that? Most systems were protected by A-TRUE. But not CryoModule! Only two Capsules were protected... No need to guess which ones, right? NERON took decision to take power from "empty" CryoTube. Problem is - what was empty from His point of view, was in reality not empty...<br>~1d<br> <br>PAOLA : <br><em>Paola didn't look at the footage, she kept her eyes peeled on Megan , only flashing glances at Jin Su to gauge his reaction to the evidence. He did not look convinced. As Jin Su looked as though he was about to lose it, Paola positioned her body, readying herself for a charge if necessary.</em><br>You're a murderer... You're a monster...<br>~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>And why did you not find your information and depart, Ms. Kelley? That would have been easier, for releasing it to the public. Why is Ms. Kent dead?<br><em>His fists are tightening, his breathing deeper. Uh oh.</em><br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Of course... Of course... Ehh... How it all started? I entered Daedalus when it were only hours before it's planned lunch... <em>She takes Her iTrackie and presses few buttons - one of NERON's terminals starts showing old recorded vids from camera</em> I unlocked records... Here... Watch it carefully... <em>It shows dock personnel putting boxes and crates into Daedalus in a great hurry - in same time security personel prepares barricades that are ment to give them better possision when assault from SDF will begin</em>HERE! <em>She points finger at one worker woman with long, ginger hairs</em> That was me. That place was so busy that getting onboard was very easy. Staying there was even easier - all I had to do is to enter an empty box, which I brought with me. Nobody even asked us what we are carrying... No time for that. At this point You all were in cold sleep... That is how I got in here. Now You may want to know why I entered here. Right? Reason is simple. Information. I knew that there is something going on. I was "listening" to You for a very long time... Reports comming in, out, in and out. SDF founding shrinking out of sudden... Attempts on Finola Keegan's life... Lot's of strange activity. It was very easy to realize that You were NOT liked by SDF and it's goverment. I just didn't knew why You were planning to lunch this ship? Whatever the reason was - it was something SDF didn't wanted to leack into public. And that actually made it very important for me to set it free into public. But SDF was jamming whole communication with place when I realized how important it was. And even before that NERON of Yours was able to resist hack attempts. I needed to get inside... Here... In person... That is how and why I got here...<br>~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>As Ms. Rinaldo says. Well and succinctly, I might add.<br><em>His clasped hands shift a little, one of them balling up into a fist.</em><br>Talk. That is an order.<br>~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>I don't know where you're getting that from. You jammed the doors. I thought you'd have a reason, and conversation is about all you're in a position for. You have killed a good woman and endangered my crew by giving yourself a duty you were nowhere near qualified for, and I would like to hear a reason, whether or not I believe it.<br>~1d<br> <br>PAOLA : <br>The more you dance around your explanation the less I restrain myself.<br><em>Paola began slowly walking to the side of the room opposite to Jin Su. It was obvious a means to surround in case things got violent.</em><br>You're running out of time, Ms. Kelley. Better get talking.</p>

                <p><strong><em>From bottom to top!</em> PART 3!</strong></p><p>JANICE : <br><em>Janice-notJanice shakes Her head on His words</em> I don't have full control of NERON. He did tried to tell You about me. He notified You that I am "fake Janice". If I would try to take and controll log creation I would clearly not managed all that and keep NERON from sending occasional warning for You through Logs. You might ask Terrence about me and Janice's death. Of course You don't trust Terrence either, am I right?<br>~1d</p><p>JIN SU : <br>Either you murdered Janice and took her place with premeditated intent, or, according to your story, infiltrated our vessel at a crucial stage in its deployment, provoked an AI whose main inhibitor was cryogenically frozen, and took her identity. I do not doubt you feared for what would happened had you been discovered, but she was our psychiatrist, our main pillar of emotional support. When people came to you with thoughts of suicide, what would you have been able to do?<br>You are either openly, outright malicious or lethally thoughtless. <br>In this mission, neither of these options are forgivable.<br>~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>I know nothing of the sort! Honestly--you control NERON, the logs come from NERON, how does your proof have any credibility? You proceeding to take her identity, managing to put yourself into cryo-storage, an intensely technical process? And spare me crocodile tears.<br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Damn right I was unable think clearly! Should I think clearly I would just leave this ship behind when first troubles showed up. Or when it was still possible to do so. You know that I am telling the truth. And I am not saying that I am not responsible for Janice's death. I am responsible. Only think that I am claiming is that was not murder, but accident. And to take Janice's identity... It took me days. DAYS! I was wandering over nearly empty Daedalus for days before I decided to try this out... And for Your personal knowledge it was NOT first time I took somebody's else identity... Ehh... Unfortunatly with NERON I see Your point. For You i might be Artificial Intelligence... For me it is just a toy that I can now play with as I want.<br>~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>And spare me your "speak freely". You're a hacker, Ms. Kelley. You've had NERON under your dextrous thumb for most of the journey. You can fake two dramatic confessions for the price of one.<br>~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>I put it to you that you were thinking very clearly, Ms. Kelley.<br>~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>You weren't thinking clearly. Rather than flee the scene, you make up an elaborate plot to steal an identity and take a crewmember's place, and you claim you weren't thinking clearly.<br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Paola... Yes, exacly that how it was. Only time when NERON wanted to create electric spike in order to kill He could not. Why not? Because it is room with NERON's mainframe, BIOS, Core Terminal... Cables were isolated better than in other parts. How many electrical spikes we had inside Nexus so far? Oh... None of them actually happened in Nexus. And you Jin... I was never taking You for idiot. No cameras on this ship? NO CAMERAS? <em>Janice stands up and quickly comes toward one of monitors, hits some buttons on Her iTrackie, than turns on monitor</em> Of course! No cameras! Wait! What is THAT?! Oh! It is just image from Bravo Dorm... Look! Cat is walking around, Chun is sleeping... Hua... Kuan Ti... And now watch THIS! <em>She presses a button under screen</em> Image from Alpha Dorm! Roland is sleeping, Andie is sleeping, one empty bed and Terrence on wheelchair sitting in corner... <em>She pushes button another time</em> And now we can see what is on the back of our ship... Wake up! We may not have cameras but NERON does have them! How do You think logs are created in rooms? NERON sees what is going on. Those cameras are not good eoungh to see everything. That is how some actions will not leave logs. But cameras there are. Imagie from them is feed directly to NERON, and unless somebody will "drag image out", like I did right now, we will be unable to see it. Look! <em>She puts in video from Nexus that shows Paola, Janice and Jin Su</em> As a side note... Be aware that I was only computer hacker while both of You have military history... Commander... Pilot... Vetera... And You are Rebell from long time Paola. Both of You would not panicked as easily as I did back than. Or maybe You want to ask NERON about those events? Should I let Him speack freely?<br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Be as skeptic as You want. Call me murderer. Call me monster. You Paola seems to take special delight in doing so. Come on... But first watch this... She again pushes buttons on Her iTrackie This is recording from Lab Camera. Have fun watching it... <em>video shows how NERON get's alarmed by signals that were monitoring crew status - one of crewmembers suddenly got status "Active Crewmember". After some short time Janice-notJanice runs into Lab and notices that real Janice is woken up and start to slowly drown inside closed CryoTube. Janice-notJanice run away from Lab and came minute later with Fire Extinguisher, and was trying to use it to breake glass</em> I was too weak... Should that be Derek... Maybe... Or Stephen... Or Gioele... Maybe they could do it... No... Who am I kidding. This glas was to strong even for them... I tried... I really tried... <em>She bows Her head to the floor</em> Yes... Janice drown on my very own eyes... I was watching Her drowing... Helpless...Unable to help in any way... I watched every single minute of Her death... How She tried to surviwe inside... Flooded by liquid which was supposed to keep Her alive in frozen state... With no power it started to melt and Janice woke up. But... Capsule never opened... Have any of You watched somebody to die because of You? She was trying till very end. I saw Her eyes... Scared... Deconcentrated... Affraid... Panicked... And I remember every minute of that. And since You mentioned other movers... There were no movers at that time. I waited long closed in box... Untill one hour before SDF was believed to arrive... Everybody who was not security officer or military personel was already gone. Daedalus was sealed and in finnal stage of preparation... All procces was automated. Not a single humman being on ship apart from me, 15 frozen crewmember and dying Janice... And that good for nothing NERON. I could run at that point Jin. You are right. I could simply open some hatch from inside and run away... But... You are right! I didn't thought about it. Come on! Tell me how You would be better in my shoose! Tell me how You would think clearly after witnessing somebody to die because of You first time in Your life. <em>Janice's tone and face suggest anger, however Her voice is clear and Her body does not show any sights of anger - no uncontrolled movements</em> Watch it... Watch... Don't stop... <em>She pressed another buttons and vid started to speed up. It showes most of time Janice-notJanice trying to open CryoTube, wandering aimlessly Labolatory, shouting something pressumably to NERON, and than suddenly everything started to shake</em> Now... Around 30 minutes before SDF ought to arrive... They were faster, assault has begun and now I was unable to escape... Should I try I would end up torn into pieces... <em>Video shows outside of Daedalus, SDF Assault Team is attacking and slowly overcoming defenders</em><br>~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br><em>His fists unclench. He throws his hands into the air, snarling.</em> Oh, give me strength!<br>Ms. Kelley, do I look like I'll cave because an infiltrator and murderer-and yes, you are a murderer, your story is entirely wanting, looks dewy-eyed?<br>Do you think I'll buy some ridiculous slapstick lie about mixed-up cryotubes? Cameras were not even installed on this vessel before we woke up, Ms. Kelley. Where is the footage from? Could this incident not have been taken from any vessel requiring cryogenic storage? The preparations necessary for the disguise you're currently donning? All signs point to prior intent.<br>Ms. Kelley, I am a known liar. I am a good liar. And I amdisgusted by your feeble, pathetic attempt to tug at my heartstrings.<br>Your conduct has been wanting ever since this ship began. You have infiltrated our vessel, through your actions killed a member of crew, taken a position you had no right to take, endangering everyone I know and care for in the process. I do not appreciate the series of brainless decisions you have undergone since coming onboard, I do not appreciate you expecting me to forgive your carelessness because you find its consequences upsetting, and least of all do I appreciate you standing here and expecting me to be taken for an idiot.<br>~1d</p>

But somebody HAS to post now so I will be able to make another post - can not post more times in row... And there is to little place to post it all at once...</p><p>PAOLA : (( Oh god! I have reading to do! ))~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>Ms. Kelley, your best bet now is the truth. No melodrama. I know you're a liar by now. Attempts to bat your eyelashes and heave your shoulders in mock-remorse will only annoy me, and at this point you do not want that.<br>~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>Stop saying that. You're an unreliable liar. I am not in the habit of viewing people as monsters.<br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br>If that is so... Why do You wait? Just kill me now. After all I am just a monster for You... Am I not?<br>~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>I...<br>I would react with emot...what a thing for me to be accused of.<br>You could have played this better. Had you been honest, had you been upfront and remorseful about the death from the start, rather than make calculated efforts to obscure it... there may have been a place for you as who you were on Eden, but right now, the one we had reserved was for Ms. Kent. I'm afraid she's nowhere around here.<br>~1d</p><p>JIN SU : <br>I see.<br>I did not forget about my own problems, Ms. Kelley. I have never done so once over the course of this voyage. The more advice you gave me the less useful it was, and I suspect the initial value I got from your words was projecting or wishing or something. Without this charade you might have had a place on our ship as an AI manager. With this? With this knowledge you will disregard our safety and con people into putting faith in skills you don't have to save your own skin? You have placed yourself in a much greater deal of danger than honesty would have gotten you.<br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br>I am sorry... Last words were not true, and You don't deserved them. But You would react with emotions and would have executed me on sight.<br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Stephen did not caused death of Your people Jin... You can not deny THAT! Accident or not - my responsibility. NERON just a machine - can not be responsible even if sentient. You would have wanted revange. You could put it in some nice clothes, but in the end that would be vengance...<br>~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>You had no way of knowing, for both of those things. We took Seagull on board. We've practically got a convict charity here.<br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br>What Archer would know? Oh... Right... You have no idea! Don't You? Even as we speack I am in contact with Him... I just told Him everything same second I become Mush. He does know everything... And He does know whether those are lies or not. Not possible to lie with pheromones Commander.<br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Well... You must agree that I did pretty good job keeping everybody mentaly stable. Or did You forgot about Your own problems? Mmm? You are right that taking Janice's personality was thoughtless and maybe I should not make all that parrade for all of You. But honestly, than You would just toss me out of airlock straight away without asking questions. Now at least You are asking them.<br>~1d<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>Archer? What would he know?<br>~1d</p>

                <p>Hello, <br>Roland here.<br>I just wanted to say a few things. First, I was really excited to see what would happen on this crazy ship. I helped with some final touches on the motives and hadn't planned on jumping. But when ArtieM asked if I would help fill out a second ship, my answer was 'Of course!' <br>Then I got Roland. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> I am terrible at playing but RNG loves to put me with him. That being said I was going to do my best to worship Chun (not generally difficult <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">) and distrust the Mush whom I blamed for getting a false positive on a mush test and being grounded.<br>However, the Mush were good guys! And everyone was telling me to calm down, so I tried to learn to be a calmer and more understanding member of society! I was pretty pleased with this internal story and did some work in PMs to improve myself.<br>The other thing that effected this ship was real life. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"> I was dealing with a change in schedule and was tired pretty much all the time for the first two weeks of the ship. After that I wasn't super driven to push my story into the open. You guys were clearly having so much fun, I decided I could more or less sit back. I hope that didn't make anyone lose out on any potential fun.<br>Hugs!!<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Just a general butt in note. Hobbes had some issues with not enough OOC going on as well, some player/character things got mixed up and all that. We ended up making a favorited OOC discussion thread late in the ship, didn't get much use because late in the ship. But I do think it would be a good thing to have on this theme in future runs (especially with all the lovely duplicity!), and am going to suggest it get added to the rule doc thing.</p>

                <p>Thanks for relay guys <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I will now post last part of that little story of mine and... And go to work. Will post later (at evening) few last conversations worthy of posting here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong><em>From bottom to top!</em> Part... 4th was it? Last part of this <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></strong> And at evening I will move to other conversations <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>JANICE : <br>Good... Didn't knew You remembered. They are easy to forget... They don't even hurt... Anyway, I won't be stopping You any longer. Contact me if You will want anything. <em>after those words She exits Nexus</em><br>moments ago<br> <br>JIN SU : <br><em>One of his legs shift back, either for a retreat or to drop into a fighting crouch. Whichever it was he doesn't get the chance to go through with it as she speaks.</em> Yes, thank you, Ms. Kelley. I was aware.<br>4min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Wait Commander! <em>Janice-notJanice catches Jin Su with Her hand, to stop Him. Than She comes close and sniff Him for a moment</em> You have one inside... You really should use soap when taking shower Commander...<br>~1h<br>Paola cannot be reached here, closed the tab.~1h<br> <br>PAOLA : <br><em>Paola didn't bother saying anything more. She was tired of hearing Megan's excuses to save herself. As Paola passed her she spat on the floor next to the other woman's feet. She didn't want to admit it but it would've been a very poor battle, anyways. Two unarmed humans vs an unarmed mush is stacked against the humans. Why did she forget the rifle? She wouldn't be so stupid next time.</em><br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Glad to hear that Commander. Doors... Doors... Right... <em>Janice-notJanice takes Her iTrackie and presses few buttons. It takes few minutes as one of Support Drones comes into Rear Corridor and repairs doors.</em> You are free to go, as You wish.<br>~1h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>I do not, Ms. Kelley. And I give you my word as serving commander on this vessel and ex-officer of the SDF that you will be in perfect health when we set foot on Eden.<br>Unjam the doors. These negotiations are over.<br>~5h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Fine! That this is what You will get Commander Jin Su. Trade. You will let me be part of Your crew, and You will let me stay with You wheter we get on Eden, or return to Sol. In return I can take care of things and people who will need it. They don't know I am NOT Janice - so they will propably be glad to have me around. I learned how to be shrink - even if in basic. That is better than nothing... End, while Paola don't believe it, I AM still same person I was, and I do have my free will same way Terrence has. Unlike Him though... <em>Janice-notJanice stops speacking for short time, as She wonders if She should tell about it, or just hide it from hummans, but finnaly decided to tell it</em> Unlike Terrence I was able to contact Hive Mind... And I do know things... Things which can help us should we need to return to Sol. Do You need anything else in that "barter" Commander?<br>~13h<br> <br>PAOLA : <br><em>Paola looked at the commander with a growl.</em><br>Really?... Fine! Well if you don't want me to slaughter this bi... If you don't want me to kill her then get her out of my way. I'm done with this conversation.<br>~17h<br> <br>JIN SU : <br>The truce is in power, Ms. Kelley. This has nothing to do with that. A crewmember who engages in manslaughter through rampant incompetence would receive their share of scrutiny and judgement even if they were human.<br><em>He holds up a hand to Paola, signalling her to wait.</em><br>And yes, Ms. Kelley. That is what I want.<br>~18h<br> <br>PAOLA : <br>If the commander tells me not to kill you then I'll only have to mark the calendar and wait anxiously for that day. I don't think we have use for a spy turned mush.<br><em>Paola lets out a low growl before turning to Jin Su.</em><br>Commander, what are we going to do with her? I'm tired of hearing her whimper excuses.<br>~19h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>(sorry - went to sleep yesterday, and forgot to set my allarm for today - had to run like hell to not be late in work, so no C2 activity from me ^^)<br>~1d<br> <br>JANICE : <br>You know nothing about Mush Paola. You are driven only by sheer hatred. I can see that You would like to try Your luck in killing me. You would do that at cost of truce betwen us, and You. Don't forget that truce is still in power... It was Commander's decision. Will You not respect His orders Paola? Turns to Jin Su You want truth? You got it. Be more straight... Say honestly what You want - You want me to help with ship, not endanger it in any way. You want me to "pay off" loss that I caused. Even if You will never trust me, You will be able to use my work for Your important mission. Is that what You want?<br>~1d<br> <br>PAOLA : <br><em>Paola listened silently as the two exchanged bouts of words. Megan giving proof after proof. Paola would let Jin watch it and gauge his reaction, not wanting to take her eyes off of Megan Kelley, just in case. The captain was getting as frustrated as she was.</em><br>I don't care if you killed her or got her killed. You're here and she's dead because of it. I didn't even know her but I fought for her not to do the mistake you did. I fought foryou. But you're not her. She would've taken the mission into account, she would've been smarter. We got youinstead. You who would disrespect someone, who I hear, is kind beyond measure. You take her place and look us in the eye and tell us you would be there for us without so much as a flinch. Bullshit. <br><em>She looks at Jin Su, trying to find something to get her not to charge forward.</em><br>You've been lying to us since you got on this ship. Also I heard you "spent a lot of money" in order to look like Ms. Kent. What about that? Also don't talk about NERON like that, you have no right to call him a tool. I've heard people talk about NERON only liking Janice. You killed the one person that this bot looked to then you forced it to watch as you paraded as her. That thing may not have real, physical emotions, but it definitely has more than Mush. Now what will you do? How will you pay back the pain you caused? You can't. Not now. Not as a creature. <br><em>She looked back to Jin Su, begging, again, for permission.</em><br>~1d</p>

                <p><strong>An investigating expedition</strong></p><p>((This expedition was rather outstanding in comparison to the other expeditions. I don't have saved the conversations, I only have still some of the text I wrote myself, maybe someone can contribute the whole expedition later. For now I will shortly tell what happened and reveal the text I wrote.))</p><p>Paola received an emergency signal of a spaceship called S. S. Eleanora. The message included the information that these people consisted of scientists and were attacked by a huge flagship. We wondered, what happened and the expedition team should reveal, what happend to the ship and whether there were still survivors we could rescue. <br>The planet had the zones oxygen, forest, deserts, strong winds, insects, ruminants and other zones, including the shipwreck. At the first expedition we lost Stephen in the forest, then moved through desert, wheer we found bones. Since Derek was the last man I wanted him to carry the bones so we can investigate whether these were of human's bones or not. Then we found Stephen and the expedition was over. Back at ship Dr. Hua could only determine that these were indeed... <em>bones</em>.<br>At the second expedition we finally reached the shipwreck:<br>________________________________________________________________________</p><br><p><em>The expedition team is reaching the shipwreck, which is lying at the beach. The name S.S. Elanora is readable, but there are lots of holes in the whole ship’s body. Debris of the wrack is scattered everywhere and are black because of burning. Some metal is melted</em><br>Eleesha: Wow these holes seem like they are originated from blaster guns…. It looks like the SDF did even attack their ship! Why??? What business did they have with them?... I don’t think the humans survived that. But let’s explore the wrack to lift the secret.</p><p>...</p><p>Has anyone found something interesting already? Ah, some fuel is still in their tanks, which is helpful even for us <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Nice, the energy at the bridge is still running. And here is a camera. Maybe we can see what happened when looking at the records…<br><em>Eleesha is hacking the comms terminal</em>. Good that you have me with you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Let’s watch the last record ^^</p><br><p><em>Eleesha is rewinding the whole record and increasing the velocity of it until some people are visible, which must be the scientists. They are talking with each about the upcoming expedition, it is visible how they are arriving at the planet’s orbit and sending an exploration ship to the planet, which is similar to the icarus. After the expedition is finished, it is visible that they found a shining artifact which seems familiar to you. It is a Starmap fragment! The scientists seem to be happy about it and haven’t seen something like that yet. Suddenly red lamps are blinking and the crew seems worried. <br>…<br><br>SDF hunters are visible at the command’s screen, which are attacking the ship. The communication officer of S.S. Elanora is sending the emergency message which was already received by Paola. The commander wants to flee, but arracks are holding the ship in orbit. He is turning the ship, which has the effect that the ship is loosing its grisp of one arack. Then he tries to flee again, but one arack is still in contact with the ship, so its’ whole direction is changing towards the planet. In panic he tries to stop the ship’s movement and do an emergency landing, but the ship is crashing fairly hard onto the ground. ..<br>…<br>It seems that all the humans died by that , at least all people on the bridge…<br>…<br>Later some people of the SDF are visible which are exploring the wrack, examining the dead people and looking in every shelves until they find the starmap fragment. One person, which seems like a leader is taking it and smiles greatly. Suddenly the automatic sprinklers of the ship are activating because of the smoke. It is visible that the leader seem to be in pain after getting in contact with water and other people too. They are leaving the wrack quickly. <br>Then there is always the same view at the bridge visible, a chew chew is coming by and visitzting the bridge, but nothing else. Eleesha stops the record.</em></p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p><p>After that expedition we knew that mushes must have been in search for Eden too.<br>At another expedition we came even in contact with the flagship again ((but I have also no log of that occasion)).</p>

I meant massage<br>~2h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>Hmmm...Yes, there is something you could do... give me a message! A real one, a special one, someone which is giving me pleasure. That will do it ^_~ i just wonder where we will get some liquid, so you don't hurt my skin..hmmm...<br>~2h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Elemele... <em>Janice again puts hand on Eleesha's head and starts to pet Her</em> I know You are angry at me... And I well deserve it... But there must be something that I can do so You will forgive me... What do You want me to do, for Your forgivnes? Please, tel me...<br>~3h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br><em>Elemele's body stops to shake when Janice is petting her head.</em> Yes you did! I am angry at you.<br>~3h<br> <br>JANICE : <br><em>Janice comes to Her bed and starts to gently pet Her head</em> Elemele... Don't be angry with me... I admit I did stupid... I should have told You earlier... Propably right away when I told You about being Mush... Please...<br>~3h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br><em>Eleesha is returning to the dorm, but lieing on her side, with her backside directed to Janice.</em><br>~3h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Of course not! That was my last secret Elemele... And... Oh... I know I did wrong. Please, forgive me. I am begging You...<br>~3h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>And tomorrow you will remember another secret you haven't told me about, which is already well-know o some other people..<br>~3h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Elemele! Please, don't run from me... Come back... I don't want to loose You!<br>~3h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Paola and Jin Su do not count... I never told them. Stephen sold me out...<br>~3h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br><em>Eleesha leaves the room and goes to Icarus bay</em><br>~3h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>I know... I should have told You earlier... I should have told You right when I became Mush... I am sorry for that I didn't done it Elemele... Please, don't be sad because of me... I did trusted You... But before I got converted I was so affraid to loose You... I was not thinking clear... And after that... Well... Than I didn't thought about it as much, because I was concentrating on that I must say You that I am Mush... And than I decided that I must give You day or two before I will tell You more secrets about Me... I am sorry Elemele... Please, will You forgive me?<br>~3h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>Stephen, Paola, Jin Su, terrence, Ian... all of them know it since a long time.. and myself? ... I am not worth to tell, right?<br>~3h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>I expected that Paola would know it, she treated you the whole time as a bad person and I always wondered why... I don't mind very much about your secret, I believe you that yoo have not much fault in it and that it was a hard ime for you, I am also glad that you don't suffer anymore! But.....but I am very sad that you haven't told me so much earlier about it! I thought you are trusting me! <br>~3h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Please... I am not happy about that... In fact I was thinking about sucide for whole time. Imagine... I watched Her death... I saw Her eyes untill She died... And She died with open eyes, so even than I saw it... I tried to help Her, but I was too weak. Than I had to make myself look exacly like She... Imagine how I felt this whole time... Everytime I looked into mirror I heared my own voice calling to me "Murderer!". I had eoungh of it... I was at state of mental breakdown and was preparing myself to sucide... But than another solution came in... Don't get me wrong - I am still sad because of Janice, and I still regret it same way I did before. It just... My emotions do not enforce me to actions anymore. So I can live. I can think more clear. I can enjoy my time with You Elemele... And I did told Stephen before... He and I... We both were in same prison. I wanted to speack about it with somebody... Since I knew Him I talked with Him. He sold me out to Paola and Jin Su. Paola wanted to... Ehh... Never mind Paola and Jin Su. Also Ian and Terrence know about it... It is impossible for Mush to lie to another Mush. I am still angry about Jin Su and Paola learning it from Stephen... What will You do Elemele?<br>~3h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>What, you...killed the real Janice? Oh my god! Well, it was an accident, but... oh my god! Does anybody else besides me know about that?<br>~3h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Ehh... Of course that I didn't played role whole time. I tried to play role just eoungh for crew to believe I am Janice. But I don't think that real Janice woud ever become willingly a Mush... I don't think that real Janice would... You know Elemele... You and me... I don't think She would be interested in another woman... I was... I am still... And I will be... That love was absolutly NOT play... And I... Yes, my character IS true. So I did played role for some time, but not for most of it... You are asking me why I was? Truth is... Just before Daedalus was lunched, when all of You were in CryoModule I entered ship... Hacked NERON and... And in all that process Janice Kent was killed... That was accident... But I am a Murderer for some people... I panicked... Ship started before I could escape... Than I wandered for few days an empty ship... And when it was possible I made sure I will look simmilar to Janice <em>She puts Her hairs back like Janice had</em> and... And went into CryoModule just after Support Drone managed to repair it. I pretended to be Janice as I was affraid what crew will do to me if they will learn that Janice is dead because of me...<br>~4h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>I am here and listening to you<br>~4h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Into Alpha Dorm my Love...<br>~4h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>In which dorm should I come?<br>~4h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>Why...Why did you pretend to be Janice?..And..I don't understand.. You are skilled in being a shrink and being an IT expert. Right? Right? and...your character...is your true character, right? You didn't play a role the whole time, right? Your opinions are right, your motives are really your motives and you do really love me, right. RIGHT?<br>~4h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Oh... Umm.. You... You are not concerned about my true identity? That I was "faking" somebody I am not in front of You? I mean... I was affraid I will loose You... But decided you have right to know, and it will be better if You will know from me, not somebody else... But... There is more in it. Why don't You come in and lie down on free bed while I will continue my story?<br>~4h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br><em>Elemele is stunned.</em> ehhh...What? I am confused...But I am glad already that you didn't want me to tell me you don't love me anymore...whew... hm...<br>~4h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Ok... But... I am really scared to tell it to You. Ehh...<em>Janices sits down on bed and looks in the floor</em> Maybe I should be honest about that from very begining... But being honest about that from begining would have been so silly on other hand... Ehh... I am just delaying right now... Am I not? Truth is, I have no idea how to tell that to You... How to start... Maybe I will start from this? <em>Janice check if Hua is sleeping and if nobody else is comming into Dorm - comfirming both things She just releases Her hairs - now You can see clearly that some of them are green, but most of them is in fact ginger</em> You see... I am not Janice Kent... I... No! It is not that becoming Mush changed me... I never was real Janice... You remember NERON claiming me to be FAKE-Janice? Well... Here You have it - I am not real Janice... <em>She looks in Eleesha's eyes, trying to figure out Her reaction and thoughts</em><br>~4h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>I am back, janny and don't want to do anoher expedition, I want to know what you have to tell me!<br>~4h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>I am sorry Elemele... There IS another important thing I need to tell You... I just hope that You will not start hating me after that. I made an agreement and I could hide it anyway... But I made prommise to myself that I will tell You this regardles of anything... So... Yea... There will be another serious disscussion... I don't want to hold anything in secret from You Elemele...<br>~5h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>Www...Wwhat??? another serious discussion? you are kidding me, right? o.o<br>~5h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Right... Umm... Elemele... When You will return... Umm... I will need to have another serious talk with You... Actually... It is even more serious than our last one... Ok?<br>~6h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>Good! I hope we don't have to do a second expedition, Can't expect to return into your arms and thighs <br>~6h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Oh! My pet will need some petting? Com to Alpha Dorm after Your expedition... I will pet You as many times as You will want me to pet You my Love! <br>~6h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>Everything is ok I would say. And when you pet me, it will be even better!<br>~6h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Elemele! How are You feeling my dear? Everything allright?</p>

                <p>Now... This one was happening in same time as next one I will put on. My original plan was to talk to no-one about this, than at 1 hour to D20 end, contact Stephen and ask Him to kill me. I panned to write three letters explaining how I feel that I must provide hummanity with sample to study and how I feel like nobody else (Terrence and Ian) will have guts to volountary accept that fate, and how it is NOT Stephen's guilt for killing me with Nathamy rifle (I would planned to ask Jin Su if He would be still alive insted of Stephen). Second letter would be for Elemele - a "Goodbay" letter if You will. Third letter... I don't remember what I was planning for third one <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> But it all went diffrent path...</p><p><strong><em>Bottom to top!!!</em></strong></p><p>PAOLA : <br>I know... Stephen told me... There's no way I'm changing what's going to happen but, if it makes you feel any better, I don't want to blow your head off instantly. I... Can't promise to take care of Eleesha. She obviously will hate me and it's a painful spiral but it is what it is. I'm mainly approaching you because of the mush in you. We need that sample and the experiments are too invasive for the sample to survive it. We've already tried using other means with Terrence but we're not getting the results we need. You will save so many... From criminal to the greatest hero. You will have your month. Wedding... vacation... whatever you want.<br>~1h<br> <br>PAOLA : <br>My dad wasn't infiltrating the most important ship in the galaxy for information. My dad didn't get warnings from NERON that said "You really shouldn't be doing this, I'm going to kill you if you don't stop". Everybody was responsible for Raluca but she was also responsible for herself. Also I seem to recall it being Ms. Kelley's idea that Raluca go to that planet, not that she should feel any guilt over it. Again, I implore you to stop making Janice's death less than what it was. Her body is still wedged in the Nexus right now, dessicated. From what I was told of the recordings, Ms. Kelley had ample warning to stop what she was doing, she chose to continue and it resulted in a death. I realize that Megan means a lot to you and I am so sorry that you have to be in this situation but it is what it is and I ask that you show some respect to Janice, too.<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>That is funny Paola... You wanted me dead for all that time... I wanted You happy. I really wanted You to be happy. To the point that when I saw you are getting upset about me being still alive and among You I just decided to stop talking. You might have hated me, but before I converted I prommised Stephen that I will take care of You if You will be ever in need. Even if He didn't kept His prommises I was never going to abbandon my prommises... No matter who I became. Oh... You didn't know that I and Your father... We were close friends when He was in prison... Right? But that does not matter now. Paola - take care of Elemele... Even if She will hate You, take care of Her. I trust it to You.</p><p>Elemele... I am sorry to say that, but possible cure for Mushines can save more lives than we can imagine. And... Well... As I said - I planed it to happen at some point anyway so... Yea... I am sorry, but that is only way out good for Mushes and Hummans.<br>~1h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>I don't want others to tell me what I have to do, especially what I have to give up to do. Jin died, because of an accident, can we blame Gioele for finding that planet? Raluca died because of an accident. Can we the crew for not healing her quick enough? No, we can't! Because it's an accident...<br>~1h<br> <br>PAOLA : <br>Life is precious, so was Janice's. As I said, I will make sure people know what she did for the crew but a crime is still a crime. Every society has it and every single one had one very important rule... Do not kill each other. Accidents is still killing. Just because she didn't remove a gun and shoot Ms. Kent doesn't mean she didn't cause her death. It was unfortunate and things might've been very different if she woke from cryo as Megan Kelley and not Janice Kent. I'm afraid you trying to stand up for her isn't going to change the situation, Ms. Williams so I ask you to stop and, instead, start thinking of ways of making the next month the greatest moments of Ms. Kelley's life.<br>~2h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>She might have not saved your life, but the life of other people indeed. Also she would never sacrifice me, I made her the most happiest woman in universe when I told her to marry me! She was smiling and showed me how much she is loving me for that. And I see now, why she did hide herself and told lies to the crew..because people like you don't want to hear her story or don't want to understand it. She turned into a mush, because she was in much despair, she couldn't live with being responsible to kill a person! She did almost kill herself!... Every life is precious...and that include hers! Since she helped all of us and was the person who found the final starmap fragment, I think everyone can see that she is not a bad person and is atoning for her sins. You gain NOTHING, if you kill her..but you gain SO MUCH, when she stays alive and is spreading herv love and her talents into the world!</p><p>And whether that was Jin Su's idea or not, we will never know..because he is a dead man, RIP jin...<br>~2h<br> <br>PAOLA : <br><em>Paola lets out a sigh.</em><br>I wanted you dead this entire time and every time I saw the Natamy Rifle I was tempted to grab it and walk right into the dorm and shooting you. I don't have so much a blood lust any more. Maybe it's the loss of a good friend... Maybe it's leadership responsibility. I don't know. you'll have time, for sure. Weeks maybe even a month for the fleet to arrive. You can change your mind at any moment. If you choose to stick it out and honorably become a sample I will give you as much time as you want out of handcuffs. I promise you that.<br>~2h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Thank You Elemele... But truth is - needs of whole are more important than needs of one... I planned to ask Stephen... Your true father Paola - to make some... Accident with nathamy rifle and me around one hour before we set to Eden. I guess now I will not have prepare arguments to convicne Him... Besides... Thing I dreamed of may be achieved only if there will be way to reverse Mushines at will...<br>~2h<br> <br>PAOLA : <br>Oh? I recall her coming to hug me once. It was Jin Su, fruit, and Andie who kept my morale high. Her assistance will be noted... However Janice would've been better at it. I probably wouldn't be so aggressive towards her if she took some responsibility about the whole situation. Instead, she got a good woman killed, tricked the mush into changing her for protection, lies to the crew every day she gives them a smile, has no remorse whatsoever, and she'd sacrifice even you if it meant saving herself. After all, she's been hiding behind you this entire time. Also don't start getting belligerent. I invited you here because you deserve to know what situation and this situation will not change. I understand your apprehension and I apologize that you have to go through this, Eleesha, but crimes are crime, accidental or otherwise. Someone robbing a house may not intend to kill its owners but if they do it's just as though you went in to kill them. They know what's at stake when they sneak in, just as Ms. Kelley. You may not want to admit it but she murdered Janice Kent. I'm offering her a means of redemption. I absolutely despise her but I am going to be fair. This was also Jin Su's idea, so don't sit there and think this is just some petty squabble. People died and people can still die.<br>~2h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>My Janny will never be a ...sample, how horrible! she may give you a bit saliva or some hairs, but nothing else. I am very disappointed of you, Paola. Without Janny's help the whole crew would be dead because of lack of morale, including YOU! How dare you wanting to lay down a finger on her, I will protect her with my life! She saved more lifes than she did destray..and it was an accident! She told me, but I can understand her, I still love her and she gave so much to protect all of us!<br>~2h<br> <br>PAOLA : <br>I'm bringing Eleesha in here because she deserves to be a part of it.<br>~2h<br>Eleesha has joined discussion.~2h<br> <br>PAOLA : <br>I am going to give you fair warning, Ms. Kelley. When the fleets get to Eden you will be arrested. We will offer you a fair trial... Well... As fair as we can make it. You have to understand that the rebel fleets are biased against mush. I may just leave that part out, however, they don't need to know that. I can't have Terrence stand on the jury as he is part of the party you harmed considering his relationship with Ms. Kent. You may attempt to flee and, to be honest, I don't think I will stop you. However, there is another option. We need a mush body to create a cure for mankind as well as one to help research the cure for Mushkind. You may choose that option to be your redemption. You don't have long to decide. Stand against a jury who is likely to find you guilty, escape with Eleesha by trying to steal a rebel ship (good luck trying to take the Daedalus), or sacrifice yourself for a cause greater than yourself. It's up to you. Two of those will earn enough respect for your name to be placed on the list of heroes.<br>~2h<br>Janice has joined discussion.~3h<br>Paola has joined discussion.~3h</p>

                <p>And in my private chat with Eleesha... At first I tried to convince Her that giving up on my live is best course of action... But She insisted that there must be another way out... So I had to "invent" one that will not include hurting anybody, providing apropriate sample and be doable in 40 minutes (and to pass through 4 rooms You needed around 20 minutes at end of ship...). So here is how it went and WHY Janice turned Eleesha into Mush... What was purpose? Were they planning secretly to turn whole hummanity Mush? Were they preparing some sabotage? Or maybe secret assasination? Nope! All was just about some kind of "Happy Ending" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Have fun reading - last of my messages.</p><p><strong><em>From bottom to top!</em></strong></p><p>JANICE : <br>Now... Elemele... We have full month... Month to my execusion... That long You will have to manage contact with Hive Mind... If You will manage - I will "escape" before dying into it... And trust me... If You will try to reach me there, I will answer! And we will be again togehter... Forever... Not perfect sollution, but better than end of everything...<br>moments ago</p><p><strong>Eleesha managed to turn Herself mush</strong></p><p>JANICE : <br>True... Only one more... Are You sure You want this?<br>4min<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>oh, it is difficult to get hurt when you really want to<br>8min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Oh... Right... You arleady have Shizofremia.. I forgot about that Hahahaha <br>27min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Elemele... Being able to swich bodys is... It will require some time for me to develop it. And to have two personalities in one body - that is not possible. I am sorry... Now... This cat is infected now. If You will make it scratch You few times... Than You willbecome Mush, as I am... Only question will be - are capable contacting Hive Mind after that? If so, than it will be no problems for You to "find" me when my body will die... But I can not force You into that... And if You will choose that - please, make sure to suppres NERONS sensors (Anonymush). Last thing we want is to have them panicking around about one more Mush...<br>28min<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>I will have two personalities..or maybe 7? Elemele 1-6 + janny <br>30min<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>I think if that works, it is better! they shall kill my mushified body, but my personality and yours will be in your body!<br>33min<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>And do you know what? I have another question and idea... what happens, if bodyswitch with me, but leaving your personality inside of your old body. and then they shall kill me! and we will live both inside of your body! Is that possible, Janny, hmm?<br>34min<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>only 4o minutes left I guess before you have to infect me... I woudl do everything to stay in contact wioth you...everything! But plz explain me more, you want to convert me, then get killed and I... have somehow (HOW) find you somewhere?<br>41min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Technicly I could just steal somebody's else body... But that would means killing that somebody in the end... And no cure for Mush. But there is another way. I can... "Escape" into Hive Mind just before my death... Remember - unlike Terrence and Ian I did managed to gain contact with it. If... <em>She stops for moment and thinks a little</em> If You would be willing to become Mush... If You would contact Hive Mind and tried to "find" me than... Well... Than we could be together again... Although not physically...<br>46min<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>Yes... Janny, yes I would! But what is your intention?<br>55min<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Elemele... That is not mean question. That is real question. Would You love me still if I would not posses my own body anymore? Would You? Tell me...<br>58min<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>You... that is a very mean question, I didn't expect that you would ask me that.. We gave pleasure to our bodies the whole time of course. That was not everything. We talked about our feelings and understood each other, laughed with each other…<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Well... Do You think about my body or my person? <br>~1h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>i meant who is going to die naturally ... I don't want to loose you, don't you understand?<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>And sentence another person to death? Not a chance Elemele... You don't want me to become really a murderer, don't You?<br>~1h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>You can just infect someone at one point, who is going to die anyway to give them their sample, Janny, you can't leave me!<br>~1h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Shhh... Easy Elemele... It is ok... It is allright... There are other ways... But both are unacceptable... To live while running away for whole time? To let them sent me to prison for so long that all I knew will be long dead from old age...<br>~1h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>No, Janny, no! There must be another way! It is not brave to throw away your own life...or don't you want to live with me? Don't you love me? There is always a way, or rather multiple ways, just because they are covered in mist doesn't mean they aren't there at all!<br>~2h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Oh... Don't worry... They will take care of You... You will find somebody better than me... You will be happy again... You will find husband... You will have childrens... I can not give You that my dear... And You will eventually forget me... And when Your son will return from school one day, and He will tell You that on history lessons they were talking about great progress in Mush Research made thanks to my sacrafice - You will than remind Yourself of me and will say that "I knew Her...". All will be fine Elemele. You will just have to wait and see...<br>~2h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>You can't do that! I would go crazy!!!<br>~2h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Derek? Come on! He is just mussle! I would not took His words too serious. And running away is not my style... I see only one solution there really... Beside that... What kind of ship will get to Eden and not get RFS? <br>~2h<br> <br>ELEESHA : <br>what? No! you can't die, I woudl rather flee with you, but... I think you got enough friends here who would even speak for you in a trial, for example Derek<br>~2h<br> <br>JANICE : <br>Yes She want me dead Very much Too bad - I planned to contact Stephen and ask Him to off me with Nathamy around 1 hour before cycle change and rush with Andie RFS. THAT would be interesting, but since She offered... Oh! Umm... Sorry I didn't told You about my "Stephen Plan" Hehehe</p>

                <p>Hey Paola here. Just coming to say that the reason the Gioele and Stephen thing was kind of brushed under the rug (even though I did follow up a bit through PMs) was that mainly because I was offline for the entire thing. Literally. I joined like hours later to a 70+ thread full of really long paragraphs. It probably took me an hour to read through it all then all I could do was hit up a long post in response to everything. The fight was already long dead, the "centerpiece" wasn't around for it so I couldn't really help stoke the flames when the firepit is nothing more than a pile of ashes. People could've helped pushed it a bit more to give me inspiration on how to handle the situation but really only two people spoke to me about it Jin (very briefly) and Janice (when I came to her).</p><p>Also I wasn't even going to mention anything about the killing Janice thing at first. It wasn't until the end that I decided the ship could use some last-minute drama (I figured it would spill into the public line which is why I invited Eleesha). I didn't do it a day earlier because people don't generally tell people they are going to kill them. *shrugs*</p><p>Sorry it was disappointing to some people. I tried to bring in a bunch of people but you can only handle so many arcs (and I was dealing with a lot, Noted likely understands that). Also sometimes you have to give in order to receive. It was really fun, though, so thank you all.</p><p>I'll hit up some memorable occurrences later... I don't really feel up to it right now. =P</p>

This is another thing that could've benefited from more OOC conversations.</cite><p>Well, like Noted said you made the impression that you just didn't want to dig into it, you just wished that noone shoudl speak about it anymore and the commander ordered so afterwards.<br>I brought up the idea with the trial, so if you would have want to dig into it , if you wanted to know, whether Gioele really did murder your mother, you coudl have supported it. <br>But probably it was an misunderstanding.<br>Maybe an OOC discussion would have really helped here, on the other side an OOC discussion is stealing away the surprise, so it is less unexpected what is about to happen afterwards, isn't it? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>
