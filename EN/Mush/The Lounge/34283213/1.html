                <p>This game was special to me before it began, because Rain contacted me a bit before my last ship died and chatted with me for a bit. We got along; Rain tried to get me to jump with an upcoming massive movement - but when I died I left my ship and joined a new one, my second shot as Finola, a character I really wanted to play again.</p><p>Rain and I chatted, and a bit later Rain decided to jump when she saw a chance to be Janice, her #1 character pick - and we quickly realized we were indeed on the same ship together - this was a first for me here, to know someone (however little) from before playing with them!</p><p>Rain's much more experienced than I, the first thing I got to learn was how to make and use a spreadsheet to track game info. It was interesting; especially when Rain decided to 'keep a few things from me' just in case.</p><p>Like morale; this game I learned how asking a player what their morale is really could track mush - except you have to be good at math yourself and know all the variables, heh. I honestly told Rain my morale - she came back with an "Oh dear, you must be mush m'dear". Turns out she'd not considered that I was a gold player, and that affects your morale. Least we got to talk it through, instead of killing each other over that 'error'.</p><p>Actual gameplay:</p><p>This game started with 1 griefer, Jin Su. He slew Roland shortly after the start of D2, and minutes after I and Janice had left the same dorm where the murder occurred. His death late D1 as a human proved him griefer, but he didn't rampage until after mush were assigned.</p><p>I very much hope that Jin Su is carefully investigated, and a consideration of IP banning is made. He found a talkie on the bridge this game, but it was -clearly- not his first game. He knew what to do, what to pick up (he went for knife and hacker kit). While he did give a speech on the empty bridge right after getting his talkie, how he moved around the ship and what he appears (from player view) to have done - that's not newbie.</p><p>Terrence was also slain D2 for probable mushiness. He was also -maybe- a new player (said hello, then nothing else - but he did not find a talkie on the bridge this game). He picked up the mush sample and the apron, then went silent. Dropped his talkie, picked it up at some point a few hours later (I checked to see who I could send private message invites to, he was on the list, briefly), then dropped it again. He moved around a little, but didn't drop that Apron or Mush Sample, so he was slain. Turned out to be human.</p><p>Chao was inactive in the refractory, either never got his talkie or dropped it fast. Stephen, a new talkie, went inactive in the camera'd engine room (Bless him, Gioele was paranoid) after talking to us a bit and never came back again (distress for newish Raluca, who really wanted to hang out safe by that camera in the engine room - we finally moved it to nexus and that became Raluca's bedroom).</p><p>Chun never talked to us, but she had her talkie. She occasionally logged in and moved around. We put her on life support, using the medikit and Janice's comfort to keep her alive. Chun mostly stayed in the lab (for whatever reasons, since she appeared utterly unwilling or unable to communicate with us, and never did anything but rarely move around a little).</p><p>The other 10 of us had what seemed like great activity, most of us checking in at least 2 cycles a day and some of us catching 6-7 cycles at least for a few seconds.</p><p>To me the big quest was of course the sofa - I wanted wanted sofa sofa! And I got it, thanks to our Hua, who took gold after mush were assigned and turned out to be level 4 and thus have technician! Still took us to almost D3 to get that sofa built, but sofa sofa! I got through a lot of the comm term stuff, Neron V3 and 9 of the xyloph DB (never got around to ghost chun, blueprints, or the second broken contact), and caught the rebel base that gives +1 AP from food and the one that gives +6 morale.</p><p>Finola's lost research reported me and inactive Stephen as not-Mush.</p><p>Our mush played it cool at first. Very little research and projects got accomplished this ship, because the RNG hated us I think. We were a little slow to kill Terrence, and when we were about to near the end of D1, Jin Su went on his griefing murder of Roland, so AP went into that first, allowing Terrence to live a little longer (and hopefully drop the apron and mush sample + start talking to us! But he didn't).</p><p>So the mush got D1 and D2 with no antimush gas up, and around C3 of D2 the gas got going. Work went into the mycoscanner, then totally silent Chun wandered out of the lab. After a bit of consternation, we got started on Mycoalarms and constipaspore, and right as that was finishing, Chun wandered back into lab and never moved again, which allowed mycoscanner to be completed.</p><p>So people started scanning on D4. Zing! Janice had two spores. Eleesha had two spores! Finola had one! Never saw mushicide soap finished more frantically, heh, and it was a very perilous feeling for those cycles. Ian had been mostly silent in the camera-less lab most of the time. Finola had almost never been out of the lab/medilab rooms (medilab had camera), but there had been access to spore her from Ian and Kuan Ti.</p><p>That cause me to pick the name of the AP - few others had scanned yet, but the shock of seeing 2 spores on two people, one on the third, when only those people had scanned yet - it was a wow.</p><p>Ian suddenly left the lab and went to lie down in a dorm (we'd been encouraging him to for days now). Kuan Ti, who had taken over Astro duties from Frieda, who was needed to serve as our second Pilot with Roland dead, had reported a planet with O2, but with seismic activity. Kuan Ti suddenly left the bridge for a dorm bed shortly after we got mycoscanner/constipaspore/mycoalarms finished and without scanning for another planet, though he'd had enough cycles to have the AP to.</p><p>Eleesha printed her report D4, and it was clear that Kuan Ti was by far the most likely mush on it! I wanted Ian dead, Ian dead, Ian dead - my subconscious was practically frothing to kill him so sure was I, but we slew Kuan Ti first - yes mush!. I'd come from the bridge to the dorms to help in the kill (shooter), and took a bed beside Janice gladly, needing that morale.</p><p>Morale issues, more severe for certain others, caused me to move to the dorm away from Janice, which put me in the same dorm as Ian. Acceptable... Oh how I itched to kill him! But I wasn't sure.</p><p>Then he slipped out of the dorm without a word, was gone for 3 minutes, came back and went back to sleep.</p><p>Hrm. Came back dirty too, didn't report why dirty. Didn't answer my challenge why he left the room for so brief either. I was low AP, had free shooter shots, and this is Ian! so... I watched. Next cycle, yep, 2 O2 lost. I went to check, yep, Ian was in the central storage the cycle before! Course, this happened on a cycle when most all the ship was asleep.</p><p>So I managed to wound Ian 3x with blaster. Turned out he was wearing armor, but others got him dead and got the O2 tank fixed.</p><p>But that was about the end for us.</p><p>All of D5, many players scanning for O2 - planet after planet without O2. planet after planet with deathtraps, so abandonned the analysis of. We finally, with about 5 O2 left, decided to risk the known mush's reported planet, hoping that since he'd reported it early, it would be honest - otherwise he'd be outing himself.</p><p>We went to it - to find out it did have O2, but instead of 1 seismic zone, it had two. We were desperate. We went down anyway. We got through both seismic zones without a death! We got to the oxygen zone. The pump jammed.</p><p>Shortly after, we ran out of air. Gioele, quite active Gioele, died first, C8. D6 C1 saw the death of Stephen - our inactive, the one best to die if someone must. And plants gave us 4 O2! We had 3 cycles of air to find more and get to it! Oh, and one O2 tank broke. Truely we are the hated of the random number god.</p><p>We got the O2 tank fixed, we continued the frantic attempts to scan for planets. No oxygen had been found as of C3, and several atrax were around us. We managed to slay those - then C4, our final cycle of oxygen, saw two fires. One was on the bridge.</p>

                <p>This ship was a roller coaster! So many times I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see if I'd die, or we'd all die, and the day I was terrified a mush would out themselves to finish my conversion, killing us both! So much suspense, such fun! And some lovely back and forth with a few people. Now <strong>this</strong> is what mush is about. ^___^</p><p>Gio! *glomps Satoman*<br>You were one of the people who made this ship really fun for me, so thank you! And Impet, well pffft I practically stalked you, I don't need to tell you I think you're brilliant. Our collaboration along the razor's edge was endlessly entertaining. I'm so glad you finally trusted me there at the end when we were a few cycles from almost certain doom. Trust me, trust me... just like I trust you. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Annoying that practically inactive Chun who we kept alive even though she was starving and not doing anything got 3rd place. Would rather see that spot have gone to anyone who was active, mush included. Bah.</p><p>Currently working on a RP write up of the ship. :3 Might take a bit though, since am on holidays.</p><p>Our mush definitely lived longer than they would have otherwise due to the Jin Su/Terrence/Roland deaths right out the gate. I wanted to kill Ian around the time Jin Su acted, because he'd already taken damage which I was almost certain was shower damage. But as Paola and I were discussing, chaos started, then more chaos. I couldn't believe my luck in leaving bravo dorm when I did - I had been pestering Jin Su with no response via PM, and I left the dorm to go check something in the other literally seconds before Roland's sudden death. Ah how sad that was! Roland, who already seemed entertaining and active, snatched away so soon. Felt like I missed death by a hair there though.</p><p>But then we didn't have AP to act on Ian, and more thing happened and we didn't have AP, and then Eleesha publicly posted a mush list with only one obvious mush - Kuan Ti who had been in and out of our shower dorm a few times and who I was almost certain had spored me before we even had the mycoscanner - he came into the lab to do research exactly once, while I was there. Well we couldn't not act, since we now had a cornered mush whose only course of action would be to do as much damage as possible.</p><p>Too bad failed planet scanning for O2 took so much of our AP there at the end. Can't believe how many planets we went through with no O2. Everything else went by the wayside because we were starting to suffocate. D: Oh how I raged at the RNG. And Raluca, obliviously working at the plasma shield in the Nexus and asking for resets as our O2 got closer and closer to the death point and we called yet again for everyone to scan. Somehow that was vastly amusing, and I wanted to hug her.</p>

                <p>Dear Impet and Rain,</p><p>Sounds like quite an awesome adventure that went badly. Too bad, my beloved Kuan Ti didn't manage to enlighten you guys, 2 spores... so close, just 1 day more and you all would be Mush!</p><p>Oh, I hate the situation where the RNG causes massive *heart attack*. On my of my expeditions, our O2 was running low and also food. We had sufficient fuel. We landed on a planet with insects, forests, O2 etc. It was perfect. I had 11 health. What happened?</p><p>We got NIL O2 because of the damn pump on Icarus being jammed. Then everytime we visited an insect area, I got hit with a maximum of 5 points being injured by a scorpion. Just me, as Hua the pilot. On the very last cycle b4 the expedition ended, I was down to 1hp. It just so happened, we visited an insect area again and I got hit with a 5hp injury and died! <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":tid_cry:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Another thing I really appreciated - Hua wasn't Mush.</p><p>Hua had bought gold right after mush were chosen, turned out to have the level 4 tech skill, and got to work on dismantling a shower and then got space capsules in for scrap.</p><p>But there were a few oddnesses about Hua, things that seemed just a little off. Hua was one of 4 characters strongly suspected to be Mush in general (I was voting probably not Mush!, but .... maybe? Converted maybe?) and was my #1 pick to have the cure if we managed to make the cure (no <strong>way</strong> was I going to let the player that made my sofa possible be killed for mere <em>suspicion</em> of being Mush! Hard proof or just cure her - period! Cause Sofa!)</p><p>But in the end we only killed 4 players. One was a griefer, 2 really were mush, and the fourth, Poor Terrence, was either a griefer too or a newbie who was utterly confused - so confused he dropped his talkie and hoarded needed items.</p><p>Other than Terrence, paranoia did <strong>not</strong> kill any players - and yeah, we had a decently huge stockpile of paranoia!</p><p>I do so trust my distrust of you, Rain <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Thank you for all the lessons, the jokes shared, the laughter, and the interestingness of all we did together!</p>

                <p>Yeah, I started a new ship when I died, on day 3 now, and actually going pretty decently.</p><p>Here's my damn novel. I'd have liked to have made more mention of certain things and people but it was already so long... &gt;.&lt; As always times and event order is somewhat adjusted for flow and me being too lazy to write this as it's happening.</p><p><strong>Day 1 Cycle 1:</strong></p><p>“Jan, I’m so sorry. They got to Liz, Molly is gone.” The words are echoing in my mind, reverberating and making thought hard. Focus! I need to focus. I thank NERON for stopping the SDF forces and request the release of the sleeping crew members from cryo. We need to escape. I need to escape. NERON complies, and in short order, crew members start running about. I am able to collapse into the corner of the Nexus while others take over. Our escape passes me by in a haze. Eventually NERON announces my title of NERON Administrator and I realize that the crew needs me, and once again I push everything down, away. It’s harder than ever. Thankfully though, I’ve had lots of practice.</p><p>I’m responsible for this crew’s well-being. I will do my best.<br> <br><strong>Day 1 Cycle 8: </strong></p><p>NERON has informed us that two members of the crew have been infected with the mush virus. As if we needed more to deal with.</p><p>A few of crew members seem to have suffered recent adverse mental effects, perhaps due to the cryogenic system. Terrence is silently lurking in the lab, wearing the stainproof apron and stroking the mush sample. He won’t let anyone else touch it, and he ignores all attempts at communication. Jin Su, on the other hand, is standing in the exact center of bravo dorm staring blankly into space. We’ve tried to reach him, with no success. Stephen wandered the halls asking random inane questions of everyone he encountered before stopping in the engine room. He has been silent since. Perhaps the most demoralizing though, Chun Zhong hasn’t moved since she stumbled out of her cryo pod and collapsed in the lab. We’ve moved her onto a cot in the corner of the room. We desperately hope that she will reawaken.</p><p>I am doing my best to keep the crew motivated and hopeful. I am full of despair, but I think I hide it well. I encourage, I smile, I explain things. It’s what I do. But if it weren’t for Paola Rinaldo, I don’t think I’d have the strength. She is a bright spot in this dark world, vibrant, intelligent and full of life. I feel myself drawn to her. She helps me rally the others and gives me hope.</p><p><strong>Day 2 Cycle 1:</strong></p><p>I’m awake, but lying in bed, paralyzed. I struggle to move but of course, I can’t. I never can. The bedroom door opens. In she walks, completely silent. Did she have a nightmare? But no, I see the glint of metal clutched in tiny hands as she passes through a stray beam of moonlight. I know what’s coming next. God, no. Not again. Have to get away, before-</p><p>I jerk upright, bile rising in my throat, the old wound in my shoulder burning with remembered pain. Hadn’t relived that in a while. But it’s to be expected. We must find the cure, we must fix this thing.</p><p>I’m not going back to sleep now, that’s for sure. But, well, I’m used to it, insofar as one can be used to post traumatic stress disorder. I might as well go do something useful. While the others are asleep I head into the front storage and study the medic book that’s there, then go into the lab and advance our current research projects as best I can before returning to bravo dorm.</p><p><strong>Day 2 Cycle 3: </strong></p><p>I used the knowledge gained from the medic book and talking with Finola to give the bravo dorm crew “routine” health checks. After all, I am a medic now, or close enough to make no difference. But I have another purpose. Apparently the skin of a human completely infected by the mush strain becomes extremely sensitive to water. And well, some of the crew members have been dirty and showered, possibly because they were trying to remove the filth from the process of creating spores. And what did I find? Well, the gardener Ian has some rather telling marks upon his skin, mostly hidden beneath clothing. He left rather abruptly after his physical. I have told those I trust, and am waiting on their assistance to act upon it. I also noted that Kuan Ti has come through bravo dorm twice already, and may have showered when no one was looking. I go to alpha dorm to check on him.</p><p>Only moments after I leave bravo dorm and enter alpha, NERON blares out an announcement. Roland is dead. I drop the medkit and race to join the others in finding out what happened, and there lies Roland, throat slit. Jin Su is gone, as is the knife. We track him to rear bravo storage and between myself, Gioele and Eleesha, we manage to finish him off. Autopsy reveals that he was not a mush, nor was Roland. We are too exhausted to do anything about Ian.</p><p>We are in hell.</p><p><strong>Day 2 Cycle 5:</strong></p><p>It has been too long with Terrence hoarding the mush sample, impeding research and in general freaking us all out. The crew kills him. He is also not mush. But at least now we can advance research and perhaps have a chance. Hope, we must reach for hope. Hard though. It would be easier to give up, to give in. Oh how I want to. But that is not an option. I have to save her.</p><p><strong>Day 2 Cycle 8:</strong></p><p>Finally the antispore gas is completed. Working alongside Finola is exhilarating. She is a master of her craft, and I am honored to be in her lab. We are one step closer to understanding the mush infection, one step closer to curing it. Now we can begin research on the mycoscanner.</p><p><strong>Day 3 Cycle 5:</strong></p><p>We have finished the mycoscanner. And much to our alarm, we immediately found that Finola has been infected with one spore level. Me, I’ve been infected with two. I don’t <strong>feel </strong>any different, although I now know that I am only one small step away from becoming one of <em>them</em>.</p><p>Finola has only been alone with myself and Ian, and well, I know I didn’t spore her. Ian’s death warrant has been signed, as soon as we can address the matter. I’ve been alone with Ian, Kuan Ti and Finola. My skin crawls in Kuan Ti’s presence, and I believe he is the one who has spored me.</p><p>However, we must focus on a method of removing spores before we deal with the mush. After all, they don’t know that we know who they are, and that should buy us a bit of time.</p><p><strong>Day 4 Cycle 1:</strong></p><p>Paola, Gioele, Finola and I spent the last few hours frantically researching the proper chemicals to infuse into our soap to make it capable of destroying spores on healthy humans. I now completely trust the three of them, as they have just saved my life. I already trusted Paola though. We’ve been talking quite a bit these past few days, and I can’t imagine her ever betraying me. I fully realize exactly how stupid trust is, but to some extent, it’s necessary, in order to retain sanity.</p><p>I’ve taken perhaps the longest shower I’ve ever taken, and feel much better. It will take some time before I’m calm though. I spent half of today waiting for Ian or Kuan Ti to come put the last spore on me. Sure, the cameras would have recorded it and the rest of the crew would have killed them, but they’d have been forced to kill what was left of me too. But now they’ve missed their chance, and we will defeat them.</p>

                <p><strong>Day 4 Cycle 2:</strong></p><p>We are becoming quite concerned about our oxygen levels. Kuan Ti has reported a planet with oxygen but he claims scans indicate seismic activity. And since we are certain he is mush, we don’t wish to risk the trip only to find that he lied about the scans. I have recommended that all personnel cease non-vital tasks to focus on planet scanning, to find one which is safe to go to. All but Raluca are complying, however, we have not found anything yet.</p><p>We have also begun keeping Chun alive via life support. It is a travesty to keep her breathing just for research purposes, but the possibility of saving many outweighs the dignity of one young woman.</p><p>On an entirely different note, Paola has become very dear to me. She is a good friend, and when I am around her, I can forget for a moment that the odds are stacked against us in every way imaginable, that I will likely never regain what I lost. I can convince myself, just for a little bit, that everything really will be okay. She is being pushed near the breaking point too, we all are, but I don’t feel like I’m drowning when I’m near her. I recognize what is happening. It’s silly. I know she’s taken. I know she doesn’t feel the same towards me as I do her. But ah, I can’t help it. I want to hold her, to comfort her. What a foolish time to be falling in love. I didn’t even think I was capable of this anymore. But, she is special, and I am a fool.</p><p><strong>Day 4 Cycle 5:</strong></p><p>Eleesha was found to have been infected with 2 spores earlier, and Gioele with 1. They have both used the special soap and are now clean. Maybe we really can stop the mush. We killed Kuan Ti just last cycle. Eleesha went to the bridge and complied her suspect list, then announced it for all to hear. It contained Chun (silly Eleesha, Chun can’t even be mush!), dead Jin Su, dead Terrence, Kuan Ti and Raluca. Well, Raluca hasn’t even come into contact with anyone else outside of rooms with cameras for the duration of the voyage thus far, and she’s only been dirty once. Kuan Ti had to realize we’d know it was him, so we came after him before he had time to react. It took several of us to subdue him, leaving us all rather exhausted, but triumphant.</p><p>But now! I can’t say anything right, I really can’t. Paola has noticed my depression, despite my attempts to hide it from the crew. It seems that I can’t hide much from her, although she remains painfully oblivious to the way I feel for her. Her response to my depression was to suggest… in front of her dad, Eleesha and Finola no less! She suggested that I sleep with her dad! I – I had no words. I blurted out the first response that came to mind. She cried, I professed my love; all in all it was an utter disaster. So now I’ve locked myself away with NERON until further notice. Cowardly, I know, but I can’t face anyone right now, when I’ve lost all credibility through being an utter fool. Why did I do that? And I made her cry… Gah.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Impet, I did save the logs of that particular conversation, and would love to post it here, if you're okay with that. ^^;</span></p><p><strong>Day 4 Cycle 6: </strong></p><p>Ian took advantage of our exhausted states and alarmingly low oxygen levels to throw his cover and sabotage our oxygen tank. I had finally passed into unconsciousness just before he acted, but Paola noticed the oxygen depletion and rallied those she could to fix the tank and take out Ian. It was brilliant, truly.</p><br><p><strong>Day 5 Cycle 1: </strong></p><p>Paola and I have spoken about the incident last night. Thankfully, we will be able to maintain our friendship. I afterwards mentioned to her that I wish I could talk with a mush without the threat of life or death hanging over the conversation, to try to understand them. She was, of course, totally repulsed by the idea. Rightly so, probably. But I just can’t believe that the infected retain nothing of their former selves. If I let myself think that, well then I might as well just curl up and die now, because I would have no purpose.</p><p><strong>Day 5 Cycle 3: </strong></p><p>Both crew morale and oxygen levels are at critical levels. Paola and I have done our best to keep everyone from giving up - we have a chance as long as we’re alive.</p><p>I’ve suggested that we go to the planet Kuan Ti reported earlier, in the hopes that he reported true in an attempt to avoid being found out. We moved to the planet and found that it does indeed have oxygen, although there is much more seismic activity than expected. We can’t afford to be picky. Due to my expertise with dealing with alien life forms, I will be going on this expedition. I might die on this trip. I had to tell the others about Molly. If I die, it’s important that they know, that they find her and get her the cure if they can. Yes, right now there’s a murderous fungus in that sweet little brain, but she still has my eyes… my hair. She must be cured. All but Gioele regarded my request with silence and flat looks, perhaps too shocked or exhausted to muster a response. Gio though, sweet Gio insisted that I will come back from the expedition safe and do it myself. I hope with all my being that he is right, but I recognize the ring of empty reassuring words people need to hear. I should know, I’ve been saying them quite a lot lately. If he’s not right though, I at least have faith that I can indeed count on him.</p><p><strong>Day 5 Cycle 4: </strong></p><p>We wandered the planet, finding wonderful things… 9 alien steaks, several alien fruits including one Hua has called a jumpkin and claims to have wonderful properties. No one took any damage. It was perfect – until we reached the oxygen pump right before heading back to the Icarus. It was jammed. Now it’s back to space, time to leave orbit and continue searching frantically.</p><p><strong>Day 6 Cycle 1:</strong></p><p>It’s hard to focus, hard to think. Dizzy. We had our first two deaths due to oxygen deprivation. The first to collapse was Gioele. I used those empty words people need to hear, and exhorting anyone who would listen. “We must succeed, to make his death mean something!” I said many things like that, but I don’t believe them anymore. We are out of food, and hunters are piling up outside since our pilots have been scanning planets instead of shooting at them – after all, suffocation will kill us first.</p><p>I vent my rage at the fates to NERON, who has been imploring us all to learn to stop needing oxygen so that he’s not left bored with nothing to do.</p><p><strong>Day 6 Cycle 3</strong></p><p>There is nothing I can do but wait to die. The Hunters outside will surely seize the ship once we are dead… if only there was some way I could get our research to the other rebels, perhaps they could finish the job. But I can’t. It’s reaching the end of the cycle and I feel terribly faint. Everything is far away, through a haze, muffled as though I am underwater. I manage to collapse onto my cot in bravo dorm as spots swim before my eyes, clouding my vision. Somehow they’re both made of darkness and terribly bright all at once. The last thing I hear is my little girl’s voice, laughter, like before. I smile as I exhale my last.</p>
