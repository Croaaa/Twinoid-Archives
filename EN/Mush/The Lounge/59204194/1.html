                <p>So the ship would end in next cycle and I would take this time to type up the AP thread before going to sleep.</p><br><p>The ship started out rather normal with me being the cool pilot Roland. Ship actually appeared to be active and that was fun! BD shower was dismantled this round which was interesting thing to see. But with the start of game and mush selection, it took a turn in the weired directions . . .</p><p>You see after mush selection, I came online to see that Chun had killed first mush, Gioele, which was in BD all the time from mush selection and didn't done anything. He was dirty pre-mush. So her methods raised some questions between the crew, and the one to speak out first was Stephen which demanded evidence on why he was killed like that.</p><p>So the talk would heat up between Paola-Chun and Stephen and in the end, with help of Eleesha I guess, Chun would kill Stephen. At this moment, when I got online, I was faced with sooo much of . . . Stupidity? Not sure what to call it, anything it is, its cringy ugh <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway, I get online to see how stupid those reasons were to kill Stephen so I called them out on their reasons for this and Chun claimed that she got some gooooood evidence on him. I done a food test in front of her just to get her add me into Hunting chat to see them for myself.</p><p>Gioele death : "Was dirty and added Chun to a private chatroom and left, which was enough for him to be killed" &lt;&lt;&lt; Remember dirty pre-mush<br>Stephen death : "Visited medlab A LOT! While had visited BD! and defended mush death" &lt;&lt;&lt; remember BD don't have shower so that, alongside the fact that he passed through medlab 2 times made this so called evidence bull crap &gt;_&gt;</p><p>Anyway I was really annoyed with the way that the game played out :/ But shit doesn't end here.</p><p>After sometime we found a planet, Jin Su would move to IB which is unprotected for expo, asking for Janice to come with him. This was clearly a mushy move or newb one. But I decided to get there and wait to see what would happen with this man in there. Waited for one cycle, then came back to see I am Eleesha!</p><p>Well that was interesting! I ran to bridge, wanted to warn crew but saw some pretty interesting messages. Chun alongside Eleesha killed Hua and Eleesha came to IB, converted Jin Su and transferred to me. I didn't had much problem finding out the story yet it was hard to make others understand. Anyway, they killed Roland and now I was warning others about Jin Su, and there he shown all his hands, claimed that hes mush, have knife and double protection and that we can't do anything to him. ((not sure if hes really a newb or just wanted to mock us))</p><p>Anyway, we tried to kill him, which sadly didn't happen since Paola died at day change and all of my plan was ruined by that. Only thing that remained for me was a grenade which I couldn't throw in the last moments of my death due to internet connection :|</p><br><br><p>ANYWAY! 1. Chun I hope you get ban forever, I reported you and Eleesha cus I can smell bull shit stuff happening here<br>2. Stephen, I apologize if I didn't defended you in chatroom sooner, maybe you could live and die by some other methods :/ ♥ Peanutz<br>3. Kuan, Paola and Raluca, you all were amazing actually, was fun playing with ya all in last moments.</p><br><p>Hope to see all of you around, expect Chun and Eleesha</p>

                <p>I'm Paola. And I'm sorry to have defended Chun when she turned out to be a *&amp;(*&amp;(&amp;* griefer in the end. But as I said to KT, I think there are more newbie Chuns who are trying their best than there are griefer butthole Chuns. If someone can give me some advice on how to tell the two groups apart, I will take it. Until then I will defend our newbie-seeming Chuns, not just because it's good for the one individual game we're playing but because I want to retain new players in the long run.</p><p>Chun claims that Gioele opened a chat with her right after selection, and I believed her because it made sense and I've seen that exact scenario before. If that was true, I think it was a fair kill. But I wasn't in the mush hunt chat until about 30 seconds before Stephen was killed (restating this bc a lot of people seemed confused about it). I made the kill shot on Stephen but I was under the impression that Chun had already discussed the kill with her main mush hunt team (which apparently, did not exist). It's still a bit boggling to me that the only mush hunt chat was the chat I opened with her after I proved myself.</p><p>I'm guessing the fact that there is an AP thread already means you guys have given up. I hope not. I think JS is the only mush left, you guys can still crush him, have some hope. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Gioele was pretending to be inactive.</p><p>EDIT: or, at least Chun claims. But I'm not sure how else she picked the one mush out of all the other people who were dirty before selection. I have no idea now what she was really thinking. I kinda wonder if she was playing for us, then got so annoyed with Stephen &amp; others being aggressive with her that she just gave up and turned griefer. Otherwise the scenario doesn't really make sense to me. But hey nobody says griefer behavior needs to make sense.</p>

Really, she didn't shown any form of evidence at all, even with Paola in her chatroom, she didn't said anything until I, as Roland, in middle of their argument with Stephen said "Maybe Gioele done something on private messages or something that got him killed? Invited her to a chat or something"</p><p>Guess she just used my "possible" scenario to play it off and in the end, just kill us all with Eleesha :/</p>

                <p>I'd be pretty disappointed if Chun killed Hua because Eleesha legitimately tricked her into thinking Hua was mush, given that 2/3 of the proven humans had expressed concerns about Eleesha's own mushiness. But I guess there's no way to come out of this game without having some Chun-disappointment.</p><p>Chun I trusted you!

                <p>As Soroosh said, and Raluca pointed out as well later, at first Chun <strong>did</strong> give an explanation for killing Gioele. It was only when we pointed out that he had been dirty before selection that she started saying that she had other reasons and didn't want to make them public. But that didn't make sense, or she wouldn't have mentioned his dirtiness in the first place. So she contradicted herself. Then Roland suggested that Gioele had accidentally invited her to the mush PM, and she used that excuse in private. Except that it wasn't true, and why would she lie if she had nothing to feel guilty about ?</p><p>There was definitely something not right here, and it wasn't just a mush misleading the main mush hunter.</p>

                <p>Jin su here... We should have killed elesha much sooner.. like... after stephen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>When the thing got serious I was standing in icarus bay near the end, expecting expedition because i knew i would not be on for several hours. When i got back. I saw some mess happening and before i read through it all, BAM iam all pink and angry.<br>Also the reason i confessed as much was that i did not believed i could hide it. So i did not even tried and worked the way, in which i knew all know iam mush and all are my enemy.<br>Kuan ti had one starting spore. so i added one the cycle i got mush and after day change i found him in rear coridor to add last spore.<br>Still got enough spores to eat and kill rest of roland in elesha...<br>Final duel between kuan ti and raluca was interesting. But i believe raluca or kuan could say better.<br>Too sad this active ship got rekt form 1/4 by a chun... I seriously hope she explain. Or confess depend on what you suspect her from.</p>

                <p>Hello, Raluca here! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Listen to my story now <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Things about Chun´s "explanations" were just like Peanutz said. <br>She, out of nowhere, killed Gioelle - BAM! 1st mush dead so soon and quite active people so I said myself: This ship´s gonna be amazing, maybe Eden (looooooool <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">). <br>But I was also wondering how our genial Chun knew... but the only thing I then saw - under the report of his death she just wrote "Dirty without reason". <img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"> Then the crew (especially poor Stephen) started to ask wtf questions, like wtf is wrong, Gioele was dirty PRE-mush and didn´t move from dorm and like what kind of evidence did she have. <br>Others were happy to see the dead mush I suppose or whatever, but Stephen was worried for other players because of Chun´s "methods" (and he was totally right). He wasn´t giving up and was like really nagging for the answer to Chun and also Paola who started to protect Chun - she said they should not tell so the other mush may listen and he won´t do the same mistake. Which sounded like good argument, so we did not get the answer.</p><p>Meantime, I posted some useful data to Chun (about who was eating in Ref and stuff - this btch didn´t shake her ass to answer me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> Only after I confirmed myself by starving, she added me to the "mush hunt chat" - which really wasn´t mush hunt chat. And I really didn´t get ANY evidence or answer there.</p><p>But get back to Stephen - as he was trying to dig up the answers, Eleesha out of nowhere wrote "I think Stephen is just an angry mush trying to protect his dead partner" or something stupid like that. I was so unlucky not to be there (just read this after Steph´s death), because it´s absolute bullshit - a mush would never act like Stephen did, psychologically not a chance ... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> It would be like attract too much attention for nothing. But Stupichun just banged at him and killed an evidently human acting player. <br>So I was really suspicious about our mushy Eleesha and then she just weirdely moved from BD to AD (to shower?) - I wrote that to Paola and Chun - I got a response that "She went to check if JinSu was dirty in IB/ER (I don´t remember exactly) but he wasn´t and it´s okay" ... so more mushy thoughts about her... <br>I really regret I was hesitating that time and spending my actions to important projects (AC, FD and BG) rather that just to kill Eleesha and everything would be okay <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Then I was not expecting anything like what was gonna happen. We were calling Janice to expo - she was not online in that exact time and we hurried. Anyway she was quite active and really helping, hugging people who needed it, our most lovely and important Shrink character ... poor Janice ... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"> As Janice was not responding like 30 in mins the Dumbass went on her Chumpage - and thaaaat was a really big Chumpage - after few seconds I just saw a report of Janice´s death - BY CHUN´S HAND, not Eleesha´s - I was shocked ... totally disgusted and mad at her - she also had torned tongue and luckily wasn´t able to pour her slime out of her mushy mouth to us. I was swearing at her even though I knew she couldn´t be able to read chats. Butt that is not the end ... after few minutes I saw the death report of Terrence and Hua as well! I was asking myself if she has LETHARGY or mush was helping, but she literally finished off Janice, Terrence alone!!! and Hua was finished by Eleesha´s hand - I said to myself that these two must be some stupid 7 years old boys playing mush together ... or just Eleesha using well Chun´s stupidity.</p><p>Then more mess went up to the scene with transfer - Eleesha transformed into Roland - luckily Roland (from Eleesha´s body) came online and confirmed himself by writing stuff he wrote before in "mush hunt chat" that Eleesha could not know. So we killed Roland´s body - 2nd mush down. At that time one mush icon appeared - we knew it is really probably JinSu - who were alone with Eleesha, he admitted it publically because the game was screwed up anyway and people dying of morale. It was C8 and Paola was about to die of suicide, so I brought her the cat - but she had literally no ap to hug it and next cycle she died <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> We had no :ap: to eliminate mush JinSu and the new day was coming and new spores with it.</p><p>Surprisingly, next day, I was alone with JinSu and KuanTi - both mushes now, everybody else died of morale loss, only I survived as a detached member. I grabbed both lenses and full charged blaster in AD - JinSu was sleeping there (KuanTi was in BD). I dropped my Trackie, I really didn´t want to hear anything from them and had better use of my inventory slots. JinSu had Knife and Plastenite Armor, because KuanTi made a big mistake to drop them when he was human. But I took my chances - funny thing is I had also a mission action points from the day before and JinSu knew it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> and I also ate - so I took my chances with blaster and fired at him thrice, then there was the 2nd blaster with 1 charge so I shot the fourth time. He was still alive, even I didn´t miss any shot! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"> Then I said myself I´m gonna try hand-to-hand attacks - that was a mistake - poor woman did nothing against armor and fat-covered JinSu body. 3 fat-absorbs (miss) and one little hit ... next cycle I tried my chances with blasters and JinSu died - one little victory of myself <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"> <br>Then KuanTi decided to kill me by morale - that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> person <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> tried to kill my cat!!!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> I was angry... anyway I needed to gather my action points by sleeping and he was following me anywhere and annoying me with his presence, so I stayed in dorm and by cycles changing I was looking at that beautiful Rope lying on the desk, I was looking at it more and more, and finally decided to end it...</p>
