                <p>hello, I was Frieda <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It was a nice and enjoyable ship. My first crew maybe to have such a bloody killing spree as early as day3. I'll try to put all my recollections here so the crew can have a big picture of what has really happened and I am very willing to know what were going through your head guys haha:<br>Okay so at the start mush were chosen, me and chao. I was quite in despair because I assumed that Chao is going afk. I immediately spike Jin Su who was idling at medlab with no camera and shower immedieately after. I do this for two days straight. THen by day 2, Chao log in and is quite active so we turned Jin Su immediately, I was the one to turn him so I was able to synchronize and choose <strong>anonymush.</strong> This was a hard decision because I was just bronze but I weilded at the end. But Jin Su, when he was still human was a bit like a griever and selfish so the crew suspect him instantly, to make matter worse the research team has sprung back to life and completed A-gas asap and on the way to that one reasearch that will make extracting a spore cost 4 ap which they did complete by day 3. I'm the kind of guy to go slow and initially plans to just turn as many as people as possible ( we were planning to either: turn Kuan Ti or Raluca) but due to Chao's insistence we kinda plan to just wreck havoc (murder people <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">) on day 4. We're supposed to do it at the cycle 1 day 4 but Chao was short on ap since he just killed Geiole due to the crew's insistent (yeah, Geiole was the 2nd suspect after Jin SU and the crew decided to kill him) So the grand <strong>plan</strong> was: Jin Su will be the one to carry the grenade, assemble another grenade, and the knife. Chao will wield the two blaster. And me weilding the armour. Hehe we have access to the weaponry because it was Chao who do all the hoarding and listing on the astropad. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> We will attack simultaneously a-dorm and wreck havoc from there, Jin Su's throwing of grenade will signal it. So everything is all set, but alas...here comes Janice. She decided that Chao was mush and killed her. Her hunch was right and it put our plan to a halt. To make matter worst, we lost the two blaster and Jin has extracted O2 capsule already. After Chao's death, they immediately suspected Jin Su and kinda out me from the suspects (eleesha's list contains my name and chao and since chao's mush and everyone but chun and me on the list are dead, Ian due to starvation and Gaiole to murder, it is rationale to think that I have a low chance of being mush ehehe <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">) We we're anticipating this, and in between inysncronity of our time zones and some misunderstanding, Jin Su lost his mettle and attack a-dorm in suicide mode. I only know that he throw the grenade. He was killed and I'm back to zero. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> This is the darkest and most confusing time of my life. I have a choice: to either continue with the attack or play human and maybe go with an return to sol win. The mood was in celebration because they thought all the mush were killed (I was anonymush) and the return to sol win is possible for me. I realize that in between the crew's attacking of Chao and Jin Su they've done several relays and repairing. And the general chat is full of "I'm down to low moral" cries. This was in between cycle 6-7 oohhh, so what if I attack later at cycle 8 and do a moeal domino effect? If I get caught, it does not matter since they will have no ap to finish me off, maybe I can still survie in cycle 1 and attack again..to further demoralize them I need to kill chun before day 4 and after a lot of convincing I set my plan to motion. I assembled the last grenade, head to a-dorm 15 minutes before day 4-cycle 1 and throw it. Thanks to Jin Su for giving me command before dying, I have enough ap to mutate and that is enough to kill everyone on a-dorm; terry, janice, chun and roland. I'm such a lucky fellow for janice and terry to be there haha. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> and the rest is history. At the start of day 4-cycle 1, I inflicited a total of 6 moral points to the crew that lead to there demise. <strong>this is the funny part</strong> After the moral domino effect, only me and eleesha was left of the crew haha..I celebrated like there is no tomorrow and taunted eleesha on the bridge nonstop hahaha. <br><strong>I'm interested to the thoughts of the other active members, I just need to hear their reactions and experiences because this has been an enjoyable and funny ship. It was a pleasure playing with you guys</strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Who art thou sircrundle? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Damn! I was Kuan on the ship, I was pretty sure you weren't mush because of how suspicious Jin and Chao were, I figured no one could have been so careless to get spiked so early on (I was really wrong there). I was inactive during that time you and Jin threw the grenades, so I couldn't have done anything to save myself regardless. That was a really clever move killing Chun on day change... Darn. I was pretty sure things would go smoothly. Never seen a massacare like this so early on. Props to you guys for an interesting ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I think part of what did us in (the 3 of us who died from depression) was that Chun didn't learn Mankind's last hope until the 2-3rd day. Me, Roland and Hua (I think?) would have survived with 2 more morale to spare, and we would've totally kicked your mutated butt <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>
