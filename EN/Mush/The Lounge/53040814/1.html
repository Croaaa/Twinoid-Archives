                <p>So i started as Raluca in a kind of active ship , some gold talkactive people here and there , some sign of RPs and crew doing a good job you know. I talked and worked in all way i could with my free time. Played all logically and human like even from the start. So i am sure noone want to hear this part so lets forward to time when i logged back in and i was mush.</p><br><p>When i got mush i actually started LOLing xD There was times i didn't get mush in like 50 ships at all and recently i have been mush alot :3 Anyway soon i checked to find my partner Roland <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> BUt i didn't talked with him right away , expect i found there is an expo going on , and they have installed camera in IB to prevent mushies activity. So i nodded a little and told in chat that i have tech points and can install the camera in nexus again and stay there. Everyone agreed , cause it was a logical thing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Thought in RC i extracted once , then gone and installed the camera in nexus and said i got dirty. I took fertile before this so free spores. HONESTLY if someone WOULD just AP count in this game they would find me completely human till the time of revenge <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Only 2 AP there was that i secret shower later on in game. I took splashproof and gone to BD and washed. BUt i saw Frieda sleeping on a bed , honestly she wasn't talkactive but would do some job. But a type which would annoy people. She was full too since she just came out of inactivity 20 min before that , so i asked and Hua and Terrence? Agreed that i kick him off.</p><br><p>I got dirty here again , so i kind of panicked a little but took a slow and told everyone they could check all over me to see i am dirty without leaving the dorm. So i kind bought some suspects on myself with that action. But i then slept in a dorm with Janice and worked in projects and bla bla.</p><p>Next day i left BD , and gone to front part of ship to work on comms and other stuff i don't remember , i idle in FAT and kind of got full AP since i wasn't actually ONLINE @ Chun this what rl mean ok? &gt;:-( So i came back to nexus and worked twice in a project. Here i made up a plan for that day , there was chance to extract twice ,i had two spores and Roland got one. SO i made a plan told Roland about it , then gone into works of rl. When game start i was in middle of week and by this time weekend came and by time i arrived home i could be online all the time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Plan</strong> <br>Was simple , Terrence and Stephen had spores and was lying in AD with Ian. 3 min to day change i would go convert Stephen , then leave extract free , next day extract free and turn Terrence , high costs but i could actually do that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Then Roland would spore Janice , i transfer and with ceasefire in AD , we could plan how to finish people.</p><p>But it changed up and down but idea of converting Terrence and Stephen was in my mind , why? Because they was active and Terrence was last tech <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> Aside about tech book but oh well! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>An expo was done and people returned to dorms. So good stuff happened , Ian left the AD , so that was more AP for me to do damage <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Stephen in BD , and Terrence in AD. Roland was supposed to be online all the day thought sadly guess his net got shaky but he returned like a hero for me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Going on , I gone to AD , removed camera , converted Terrence , gone to RC extracted both spores of that day. Then gone to BD , removed camera ((all with tech points)) And converted Stephen........</p><p>SADLY <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> Eleesha was there and her observant skill noticed me spiking Stephen. So chun was online at the time and killed him. But my plan still continued , i shout at mush channel to Roland to infect Janice and at same time i moved to kitchen , repaired micro with my last tech point and use it to break down the net. Since we had D5 base contacting us and i knew people are low on morale since Janice......... was a weirdo <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Admins can yo delete above message? It got twice posted &gt;.&gt;</p><p>Anyway going with story ((P.S: Chun i asked Janice to comfort me and she agreed , but i gone for rampage thought)) So i returned to BD , to find Stephen dead , and Roland infecting Janice and saving my ass in last moment xD I hit Chun with my last drop of AP , Then transferred . Ran to AD and ceasefired. Also i infected Derek here , so derek me terrence and chun been in AD. And Terrence been standing , we start to talk in chats together and he told me Paola have 3 morale <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> So three deaths should do the job , and seems me breaking the link didn't made her happy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So a little update , Bridge = Gioele and Paola , Lab = Frieda and Ian , BD = Roland , Ralulu and Eleesha AD= Derek,Terrence , Janice and Chun</p><p>Anyway we plotted a little , then Roland gone and created a genrade BP , got the knife from a storage! ((Humans kind of lost because they was poor at managing weapons they had)) And gone to BD , killed eleesha and hit Ralulu two times. Then moved to RC and idled there. Terrence got the knife and proccessed with killing ralulu but she didn't died.</p><br><p>Most fun part was that Ralulu was ONLINE! xD She would struggle by lying down on the bed while terrence trying to kill her <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Thats clearly is because she didn't had Italkie and no energy ~.~</p><p>So Terrence returned to AD and here our last part of plan took place. The most deadly part of ceasefire is that you can aborted it anytime you want. Thats deadly since some human drop their guards down and be like "I will return when ceasefire done" So with my saviour angel <span class="tid_user tid_user_304271 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="304271">Orianna</span> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Which i won't say how she did help , i got to know that there is a genrade in CAS.</p><p>I left and took it , Terrence attacked Chun and transferred to Derek. I got back to find Chun ATTACKING terrence <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Confusment is great! She hit him alot , i throwed genrade , and after that Chun killed the Terrence ((human <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)) sorry don't mean to be an ass but reading chun last words <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> That was fun , derek killed chun , then we rushed to BD and kill ralulu . Then we killed cat and next cycle humans died ((3 of them)) , two remained , Ian flee with patrol ship and Andie trapped in Nexus. Last part was just for fun which i attacked Andie 4 times and got him into low health.</p><br><br><p>So this is it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>Last words</strong><br> Chun i was seriously angry at Andie idling in nexus when i was about to do rampage. He was doing a stupid mistake , since i was really away and he could have killed a human with taht ((Since i looked after my morale really well)) But tell me when C8 came if i was human i would have 1 morale. Next cycle i would be dead ,what would you do for me? you people didn't even knew there was 3 pills which would give 3 morale to you. You had biologist Ian too , and not sure about yourself.</p><br><p>Anyway it was a fun game.</p><p>Also seems i forgot it but 1 hour before our rampage start , Jin which was a newb for sure killed Hua for us. Thats the most greatest thing ever , Since with her death one of greatest threats got removed <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And two morale down to humans xD So can say it was like a fortunate thing on our side <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But same as always both sides made mistakes but in end , we won. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And i couldn't create a great chess board in this game sadly or atleast enjoy it that much since rampage was done in 2 cycle barely. So add me to your contacts i hope to meet everyone in other ships <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hua here. When I came to found myself dead I thought the mushies rampaged as the conversions weren't really that easy, everyone was being careful more or less. Instead I got killed by Jin Su <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Who I knew was human even before that food test, as he had eaten 2 cycles in a row earlier.<br>I love his last words, he's wrong on everything...<br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Hua, you are stupid. I've told the Chun all MA placements. And you started discoved MA and taking them off. Awful crew.</span></span><br>Jin, if you're reading this by any chance. 1st of all, Eleesha was the one who was discovering the alarms, not me (and even that is understandable since you went rambo with them without being confirmed), I only uncovered the one she already showed was there as it was pretty obvious <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Secondly, you're the awful one, you were barely online, didn't communicate at all and made horrible decisions.
