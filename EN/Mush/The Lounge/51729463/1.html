                <p>So, here it is from my POV: Mush selection: me and Eleesha are alpha mush. Immediatly, she decides on a suicide attack: at around D3 she hides the camera, hides the apron, infects Raluca with one spore aaaand...gets killed! Despite my protests that her plan is stupid, she went with it. The damage was minimal, but I guess she wanted to go off the ship in a nonreportable way.</p><p>Now, as to my story: ship needed to move from the first planet. I used this an excuse, spored twice, loaded fuel and said I was dirty and also trapped the fuel systems. I stayed dirty long enough to spore again on next day and only then wash up.</p><p>Roland was he designed fuel loader - and he got infected everytime we moved the ship. Soon he was converted, and chose anonimush. Happily, he was not crazy as Eleesha was. We agreed that he will just keep low and gun for the return to sol or eden even if I get killed.</p><p>I did a bit of research on neron, half of it useless. IAN was correct to call me out on it, but did not do anything ! Now, I basically just kept infecting the fuel system. Ian was super active and I really wanted him on my side. Luckily, after I asked Roland to not touch the fuel, Ian went ahead and got infected twice from loading fuel. This was by midgame, so some useful research was done - it was not so easy anymore for me to extract and more spores were needed to infect.</p><p>By this time, people were really suspicious of me. Roland confirmed that in private chats people suspected me. I was getting desperate. I was ready to do something crazy - like dismount a camera and infect Ian directly, and use anonimush on me to keep him off the mush list.</p><p>LUCKILY, I was online just as Ian decided to load more fuel. He ate one spore that was placed before and I beelined my way to him in the engine room. Infected him, used anonimush. A new mush was on the team!</p><p>Sadly, Ian was the go-to expedition member, and they took off on an expo when he had only 9 HP. He died. Now, the crew saw that 2 mush have died. They rushed pilgred, but were unsure if they were mush free. It was time for drastic measures. I spored up and bid my time. Janice was the target, because she had the Hacker Kit. She was sleeping in my dorm, but saw that I was dirty and called me out on it. I waited till the cycle changed. A fire started! Perfect opportunity! I had on me armor and knife from Day 1 - nobody ever questioned me on it, despite me dropping it many times to change items and etc! I killed her. The crew was onto me. Both Terrance and Gioele tried to down me, but I had hard skin and armor. I asked Roland to beeline for the room so that I can give him HK. We exchanged it and he ran to front of the ship to take us to Sol. He was lucky and took us home on 1st try :-)</p><p>My advice to myself and what I learned from game:</p><p>1) If someone does something fishy - do not just call out on it, ACT on it. Ian and possibly others was on me from day 1 but did not force anything. <br>2) If possible, alternate people who do routine tasks, like loading up on fuel. It will distribute spores more evenly and will make mush take more risk.<br>3)As mush, do the bare minimum of normal work to stave off people as much as possible. Relay a bit, do something useful, but always combine it with sporing and infecting. You want to act semi active, with legitimate human work to show, but not too much. Don't talk too much. Promote your human work. Try to wait off washing if you can combine it with another round of spore extraction.</p><p>All in all, it was great fun! Roland, thank you for keeping cool and being my last resort in case I failed. Ian, you could have been a great asset if you did not die on that expo. Human team: you were super close to catching me, in fact by Day 6 I was panicking pretty hard.</p>

                <p><cite>1) If someone does something fishy - do not just call out on it, ACT on it. Ian and possibly others was on me from day 1 but did not force anything. </cite> There's two kinds of players in Mush; players who hunt and players who casually do their jobs. Many players on public ships tend to have the mindset to report any suspicious activities in chat and let someone more dedicated to the mush hunt use that information, regardless if said hunters actually exist or not</p><p>To be fair ... It takes time to discuss and coordinate an attack on a suspect, and while attacking by oneself without discussion is legal, most people won't do it because they're not confident of their suspicions enough without talking it over thoroughly. And since Ian is Ian, he has the added bonus task of convincing someone else to the deed</p><p>In any case, well done</p>

Good run everyone!</p><p>I saw you <strong>KT</strong> took the knife on the first day, and told about this in Russian channel when Ian suspected you. That was my fault not to share those thoughts with English speaking part of the crew, but after Ian was dead and turned out to be mush (we assumed he was Alpha) all his suspects were automatically "washed" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And we had other problems to worry about. O2, Fuel...</p><p>Absolutely agree with all your advices!</p><p>What shocked me the most: Roland! He was one of the gang! <strong>And mush!!!</strong> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It was a nice run, will be happy to see you on next runs.</p></cite><p>I was very lucky to get Roland! He got converted quite early on! And he had your trust, so I was informed on your chat. Ian was much harder to get and much riskier. I was lucky to be online and have the AP to convert him when he was loading up fuel <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
