                <p>Roland here! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This journey might only survive for 6 days, but boy does this journey is nerve-wracking!</p><p>So, we started off with a team of not-so-active people and mediocre people as well. Jin Su went dirty twice on the early stages of the game, and I contacted Eleesha about this. We assembled a team consisting of me, Eleesha, Chun, and Raluca. The Mush hunt is on.</p><p>But not really that great.</p><p>Derek is a newbie, and he proved to be a threat when he read the Botanist thread without telling. Then he hid a spacesuit on the rear corridor. Eleesha immediately killed him. Not the Mush.</p><p>Hunters are coming quite fast, and with Andie half-active and me participating in patrolling and investigating, I don't have enough AP to kill them. I managed to do it though, finishing a batch of 4 hunters, but the next cycle brought more and I ran out of AP.<br>That immediately took the toll and reduced the hull until 9. Problem number one.</p><p>The Mush hunt isn't going so well either. The Mush aren't really active in doing Mushy stuff, so Eleesha and I set up a list of suspects containing Ian, Kuan Ti and Jin Su. But they weren't doing any Mushy stuff at all. It got confusing, and with Chun being half-active as well and Raluca not knowing anything outside her zone consisting the rear turrets and the Engine Room, we're stuck.</p><p>First expo came in. I volunteered to go with Ian. Frieda was inactive at the time, and Jin Su was somehow always inactive when I forced him to go with me. We even were in the planet for a day, and to quickly finish it Kuan Ti offered to go. The expo went well, but immediately after going back to Daedalus... third mush!</p><p>It got hectic. Very confusing. We have to quickly flush out one of them to gain better leads. Paola joined in our Mush hunt team but she wasn't bouncing great ideas at all. Eleesha then killed Stephen after theory suggests that the Mush might be targeting somebody inactive, but he isn't the new Mush nor the old one as well. But then, Gioele sorted things out by himself and got Jin Su dead in his hands. Jin Su is one of the Mush!</p><p>It would seem like we got some progress on the hunt, but after that there was nothing again. Oxygen stocks ran low. Eleesha then killed another inactive. I started suspecting Eleesha and assembled another team consisting of the rest of the Mush hunt team and Gioele to maybe, figure out if Eleesha was the Mush all along and it was all my fault.</p><p>On Day 5, Eleesha set off with Gioele to kill Ian, who after got attacked by, confessed that he is the Mush. The oxygen stocks are only 6 at the time, and we all are pretty sure we would end up in the dark space, bodies floating around. There's still one Mush to uncover with Ian not dead at all and managed to sabotage the gravity thingy and the oxygen tanks. The oxygen got to 3 on the next cycle. Things are looking pretty grim.</p><p>Frieda confessed after that she is the second Alpha Mush after Jin Su, and she transformed to her ultimate nasty state on the Bravo Dorm to keep her from being assassinated. Yep, all of us are prepared to die with no AP left to do anything important.</p><p><strong>Except Raluca</strong>.</p><p>She came up with a plan. First, she Geniused the Natamy Rifle for us to use to kill both Ian and Frieda. Then she will advance PILGRED as quick as possible with help on relays from the rest of the team. She said it is possible, and it would all be done within several cycles. We still have hope, but that is a slight chance of survival. So, why not, we took up the task. I took the Natamy Rifle to shoot at, but I ran out of AP when I got to Frieda. Gioele is there, so I left the rifle there.</p><p>Cycle change. Oxygen stocks were 0 before, so one of us was going to die. And boy, what luck. <strong>It was Frieda</strong>. One Mush down, only Ian left. We were having hopes of surviving this hell. I set off to the refectory to get me and Gioele some food to kill Ian later, using the microwave because the comms signal has been down since.</p><p><strong>Then Chun came</strong>. As a true humanity's last hope (well, kinda like Daedalus's last hope), she went active, took the rifle, and killed Ian. No Mush are left! We kind of won stage one of Raluca's masterplan! The timing of Chun's activity is so convenient. Now we only need to finish PILGRED with Raluca.</p><p>Except you can't really finish it at that exact cycle Chun killed Ian. Raluca ran out of AP, and with full stomach, we'll have to wait for the next cycle for her to repair PILGRED the last time since she has the sofa set up in one of the turrets already. The two rations I brought to the Engine Room can't speed up the process, and Terrence, who happens to be the only second person to have the Technician skill, is... basically a moron, we really have to wait another cycle.</p><p>And there's no oxygen.</p><p>Gioele was the second commander, so he ran to the Bridge to wait for the signal of PILGRED's completion. Everybody else is holed up in the Engine Room to help relay PILGRED, but we can't get it to 100%. There's no other choice, the oxygen would have to take its toll one more time.</p><p>And we're hoping it isn't Raluca or Gioele who dies after. Else, the whole masterplan would fall apart. <strong>It was a tense 3 hours wait for all of us.</strong> We exchanged ideas, revisit the reasons why we fail to spot the Mush earlier, and the sheer epicness of the wait resulted in an agreement to make an AP. 3 hours passed so slow, and it was 5 AM for me at the time (I'm writing this at 6:37 AM, so no sleep so far).</p><p>Last 10 minutes, people were busy saying goodbyes. Chun and Paola are relaying the PILGRED one last time. People were saying prayers to the Random Number Generators and equipment in the Daedalus that the last person to die would have to be the imbecile Terrence.</p><p>Then, day change. Day 6, Cycle 1.</p><p>I found out that the plants are still giving oxygen and we suddenly have 1 in stock, but it doesn't get passed to on day change, meaning somebody would die whatsoever. <strong>It was Paola who died</strong>. Gioele was in shock, we were in a mix of happiness that none of the key factors in winning the game didn't die, but mourning the loss of Paola.</p><p>But we did it. Raluca fixed PILGRED. And here I am retelling the story. It's all thanks to Raluca and Chun. The autistic genius and the assault-rifle-wielding, hippy-killing, really-the-last-hope-for-humanity nurse.</p><p>(man that was long)</p><br><p>So, come out, you guys! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I'll go sleep now...</p><p>A family of 4360. <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4360" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4360</a></p>

                <p>I was Jin Su, my first game, and alpha mush right out of the tutorial. Unfortunately my one true mushy action was to finish converting Ian. The inactivity was due to stupidity/curiosity with AP usage as well as trying to run around the ship and research/fill engines/move the ship and more. GG and good hunch Gioele. <br>I wasn't able to go on the mission due to not keeping up to date with the expedition thread and having extreme commitments elsewhere.<br>MVP goes to Ian for picking scrambler to hide my screw up by spiking him in the research lab (didn't see the camera), surprised Terrence didn't notice.</p>

You know, this was one of the craziest ships I ever saw. <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4360">Here it is, BTW!</a> I was never much of anything on the mush hunt; I think I got proven human when I invited Eleesha in to see my lunchbox I was eating out of on day 2, and I got to follow along with the hunt after that, but I never could contribute much since I never really saw anything but my turret, the Nexus, and the Engine Room.</p><p>Then Janice stormed into my turret and said that Eleesha was a mush and had converted me too when she was in my turret to confirm me human at my request. I was convinced that Janice was a mush and trying to spore me in that turret, so i chased her out to Rear Corridor and grenaded her crazy butt, but she was a human! I still wish I knew what the heck she was thinking coming in my turret without being asked. She sure as heck didn't do any comforts on me.</p><p>Aside from my erm, 'explosive' meeting with Janice, I wasn't even that big of a figure on board until the last 9 hours. I helped pin Jin Su as a mush via the list, but I never had a clue who the other two mush were. I was just quietly doing my job until then, trying to think about who the mush could be while I did it. I logged in to see Ian and Frieda gloating about their victory. Something, I'm not sure what, irked me about their smug, certain win and I just said to myself 'No. Not today.'</p><p><strong>So I planned.</strong></p><p>The Mush had sabotaged everything, <em>EVERYTHING</em>, even down to the gravity simulator. But the lab was still there, the command terminal was still there... I looked at my tools, I had my Genius, still. I had more free Pilgred repairs and it was at 60%. This began to become possible in my mind. I had been saving Genius for Plasma shields since our hull was in ruins, but with death coming in just three cycles, tops, I figured It was use it or lose it. I wanted to make the Serum and just cure Ian, since he would be the hard one to kill, but we didn't have the disk, and Chun was not around, so I took the next best thing on there I could think of, and that was Natamy Rifle. I actually fired on Ian myself, but I missed and broke my shoulder which ended my use as a fighter against he mush then and there. So I told you guys where I'd leave it and left it up to you all. I had PILGRED to worry about, now.</p><p>It was incredibly lucky that Frieda died of <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> that next cycle, and we were left with Ian. Just Ian. if we could just somehow get him, but so many of us were out of commission by then. We had to hope he would be the next to suffocate. And then Chun appeared, so quiet all along, she swept in the the goddamn terminator and mowed that hippie down with the Natamy Rifle. No more mush, now it was down to getting Pilgred done, but that wasn't easy with the ship in its sorry state. Thankfully, I had a second sofa, built in my turret early on after I made Paola's, so I had the AP to keep beating on Pilgred. It went from 60% to 80% the cycle Frieda and Ian died. Just 20% to go!</p><p>So we sat and waited. day change was next cycle, and with it, my 2 AP for another hit, and a free Pilgred point for a second hit. All we had to do was live. No hunters to destroy our sad 9 armor, but no O2 either. I sent Gioele and KT up towards the bridge, Gio was commander, and KT was next in line if Gio suffocated this cycle. Everyone else except Terrence gathered in the Enngine room and we hoped for the best.</p><p>Then, the cycle change, the day change is here! Neron announced the suffocation. [Raluc- ...Paola has suffocated]. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"> You trolling little jerk. Everyone almost had a heart attack when Neron pretended to name me for a moment. I was alive though, and Gioele too! Those two hits took it from 82 to 100% and we were home free, Gioele threw the lever and sent us to victory over the mush, who were so, soooo sure they had it in the bag just hours ago. My plan worked, despite scare and hitch and adversity. I <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">LOVED<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> you guys and I'm gonna miss this short but incredible ship.</p><p><strong>JIN SU:</strong> You did good for your first try. people suspected you but I don't think we had anything concrete until THE LIST just outright damned you. I wish you good luck in the future, you nearly caused our death by getting Ian.</p><p><strong>CHUN:</strong> You sexy beast, I barely noticed you until you came in out of nowhere and went avenging angel on that hippie for us. You really were Mankind's Last Hope!</p><p><strong>GIOELE:</strong> The man who took down Jin Su. you became commander and did it welll for the rest of the ship. Sorry about your daughter.</p><p><strong>KUAN TI:</strong> I admit that at the start when you were butting heads with Ian constantly and taking the knife, I kind of wished you'd jump out an airlock, but in the last hours of the ship, you found your inner hero and helped us all make it home. Thank you.</p><p><strong>FRIEDA:</strong> Freaking stealth mode mush. I don't think anyone even suspected you until you came out of the mushy closet to help explain how hosed we were. You got dumb-lucked by 02 loss.</p><p><strong>TERRENCE:</strong> You ask for scrap, so I buy scrap heap. You vanish for a full day so I end up using it for my lizaro -&gt; sofa build. You come back and ask for scrap, so Roland goes scrapping. You never use it and vanish for a day, so we use it for blueprints. You come back and ask for scrap and we build the dismantler and there it sat for the rest of the game. what the heck was with you?</p><p><strong>ROLAND:</strong> Mighty protector of the Daedalus. you did everything in your power with what little you had. I commend you sir.</p><p><strong>ELEESHA:</strong> You got paranoia and it named both of the remaining mush, each outburst... That was the creepiest thing. I could tell you ended up learning tons about the mush hunt while you worked with us, and you were a big help in the long run, nailing Ian.</p><p><strong>PAOLA:</strong> Trading the Scrap heap after it was used up was a BRILLIANT idea, I'd never ever seen that before. Good on you for thinking of it!</p><p><strong>IAN:</strong> Who's laughing now, hippie!? You had a good run though, You and your partner broke the whole damn ship. And everyone's spirits. Everyone but one.</p>

                <p>Gomfury, pretty sure the whole ship agreed that you're going to be fine playing as Mush. Just a little bit of Mush cunningness and you'll be set. The clear communications and great English made me think before that you're saying you're a newbie to cover up the fact that you're Mush.</p><p>And Chaytel, <strong>YOU'RE THE HOGAN!?</strong> Wow, I missed you, I was Frieda! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>To be honest I like the surviving part more — if everyone is also that motivated to go to Eden.

But at least after starting the Mush hunt the particular Eleesha is very supportive, so this ship gets an exception.</p><br><p>And anyway, the man that gets the ultimate shame of the ship, Terrence: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/u/profile/6114174" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/u/profile/611...</a></p>
