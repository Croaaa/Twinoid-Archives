                <p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7998" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7998</a> <br>Never made an After-Party thread before, so let me know if I'm missing something.</p><p><strong>I was Eleesha! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/eleesha_williams.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_EW:" class="tid_ico"></strong></p><p>I chose her because her role is very involved in the mush-hunt, and I've always been fond of the detective-work that goes into picking the villain out of a crowd. (Forum mafia anybody?) Lucky for me, however, I rolled Alpha Mush for the first time! Using Eleesha's role to try to shake off suspicion would be just as fun, if not even more.</p><p>I tried to choose my skills strategically. Neither Tracker nor Determined would hamper my abilities as Mush, but I hesitated to take Observant. Free searches are great for Myco-Alarms, but I was worried I might notice some of my mush-buddies mushiness, and being new to Eleesha I didn't know what to expect. Originally I was just going to pretend I was Silver, but then I noticed I had already picked up two items at once, so that was out the window. Plan B was to just claim I hadn't enough XP, and that worked out great because then I had an excuse to take Observant before the Myco-Alarms were placed.</p><p>My partner was Kuan Ti. Neither of us were especially experienced, but we did fairly well. Earlier in the game he slipped up and got stuck dirty in a corridor, and Terrence was quick to jump on his case. By the next time I logged in, however, Terrence was dead and (at least over the public radio) nobody seemed to have noticed Kuan Ti's slip. I thought at first Kuan Ti had just outright stabbed him to death, and was amazed that he was still alive, but apparently Janice did that.</p><p>If I remember correctly, we began with an attempt to convert Raluca, but ran into some obstacles once she was safe under a camera. I trapped Rear Corridor and Jin Su picked it up, which ended up being extremely helpful when he miscounted his AP/MP and got stranded unguarded in the Alpha Bay. The stars aligned and Kuan Ti and I were both able to drop a spore on him, and he was as good as ours.</p><p>It was around then that things got very tricky. Stephen was actively mush-hunting and had his eyes on Jin Su. He asked me to track him. As a side note, I didn't get my hands on that scooter for about half the game. Terrence was being greedy with it, and once Janice fixed that (I'm joking), it still took me quite some time to get it from Jin Su and figure out where the heck it was. Anyways, Stephen wanted me to track Jin Su to see if his suspicions were correct.</p><p>The problem with that request is that I had been spending a good amount of AP on being mushy, and wasn't so sure I wanted to spend the rest on gathering information when I could just bullshit it instead. I was actually trying to cast Jin Su in a suspicious light, as this was happening a little before we converted him, and after the conversion I had to backtrack a little and lessen the damages. Now that he was mush, I wanted him alive.</p><p>Then Stephen's focus turned to Kuan Ti, and the outlook wasn't so good. Like me, Kuan Ti hadn't put as much AP towards the ship as he could have, and that made him suspicious. I was very conflicted about discussing Kuan Ti because I wanted to make him appear innocent without condemning myself should the crew kill him and find out he's Mush. I tried, but when you counted up his points, it was pretty damning.</p><p>I knew that if Stephen was as competent as he appeared to be (he was), I'd be next on his list. Throughout the process I was convinced as soon as he was done asking me to track people he'd kill me, and that the questions he was asking were tricks to determine my innocence. I didn't dare to outright lie about Kuan Ti or Jin Su, as I was sure he'd go back and double-check my answers. After all, while Eleesha can follow people's movements a bit more conveniently, anyone can do it.</p><p>Lo and behold, I logged on and both Kuan Ti and Jin Su were dead. I expected Kuan Ti might die, but considering Jin Su was innocent for most of the game... That was surprising. Had I actually tracked him it's possible he would have lived, because the details would have shown him innocent. I was glad to be alive!</p><p>Feeling as if even the slightest slip would be the end of me, I decided to claim the list could not be printed and avoid doing anything mushy. There were times when I was very tempted to convert Raluca, considering she was already at two spores, but I knew that it was a big risk considering she might not have the mind to immediately take Anonymush. (I took it when we converted Jin Su, and we were hoping Jin Su could take it to convert Raluca, but that didn't work out.) So I bided my time until PILGRED was finished.</p><p>Funnily enough, I spent the last three days camping, and when I jumped onto the ship I totally forgot I had obligations which would render me inactive for several days. The fact that PILGRED finished before I had to leave, and I had enough cycles to fill my AP for the Hacker Kit, meant that I was able to end the game the same morning I left for camping. The universe was on my side, it seems.</p><p>At times I felt guilty for taking such an unexciting approach of doing nothing mushy for the remainder of the game, but reading Stephen's last words was very reassuring. Playing as Mush with a strong hunt was rewarding, and I've learned to pay attention to how my time in bed relates to the AP I spend publicly on the ship. Thanks to everyone who was active, I had fun!</p>

Glad you had fun. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I'm usually not used to starting the hunt for mush, but seeing as there weren't enough people that actively hunts them (I think Terrence was, but he got killed quickly by griefer Janice), I decided to give it a go. I was a Stephen, after all, and there shouldn't be much to stop it since I can afford to spend some AP/MP to wander around and check for logs, except it seemed that I was destined to Apprentice Pilot this game.</p><p>I then asked Eleesha to be the one to gather logs for me on Day 3 I think. I was mostly on the lab in these times to finish some basic researches, so I wasn't sure if she's initially doing her job. But still, I got what I wanted from her and confirmed Terrence's claim before he was killed. When I finally got everything mapped out for a potential kill though, Eleesha didn't want to join and that's when I realized that I should've been looking at where she's spent her AP as well. I am not confident with tracking the AP &gt; MP expenditure though, so I left it for a while.</p><p>I left the channel with Eleesha after dropping my Trakie for the first expedition since I think that's the least suspicious way of leaving it and formed another one with Chun and confirmed human Ian (and later on, Finola). Things happened and then the Kuan Ti kill happened, followed by the Jin Su kill soon after. Eleesha then said she couldn't print the list, which I kinda found hard to believe since Kuan Ti (and maybe his partner) should have generated a lot of spores from the AP he's hiding. I pretended to buy it and told everyone on the channel that we should try finishing the Serum as soon as possible and stick it in Eleesha just to be safe.</p><p>I think Eleesha messed up a couple of times after she claimed that the list was unprintable though. One was that she had searched for the Mycoalarm in the Engine Room even though it's unnecessary for a human Eleesha to do that. Another is that she claimed to have 14 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico"> after a Day Change, which Paola had called out. Since we already planned to stick the serum anyways and feared for a rampage since I was at low HP, I tried to save the situation. Last was that she claimed she was unable to fix the broken Oxygen Tanks despite being on a bed the whole time. Remember to keep those in mind for the future games <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">. The final evidence that showed up against you was the unlucky (or lucky for us) Xyloph list, which listed Jin Su as negative.</p><p>I don't know why the research for the serum went too slow though. While I'd understand why we need the Pomade and the Meridon Scrambler, I'm not sure why Anabolics and Mush Reproductive System was given priority to the Retrofungal Serum. I think another problem that the research team had was that Chun, Finola and Ian can't find a time where at least two of them are online at the same time, which I can't fault. I wanted to try to help once the hunter problem was fixed, but having 12 of them on the sky at all times and being dirty meant I can't. The last time I shot them was on D10C6, which I was given a choice to return to the Refectory and continue pulling out Coffee, or go to Alpha Dorm and watch Eleesha. I guess I got too greedy in the end. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
