                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1866">This Game</a> is finally over. Held out a lot longer than I thought it would. <br>I was your commander for the longest portion of the game, Chao. Things went pretty well for a while, with one of the mush taking Anonymush before infecting anyone else a day or two after I became commander and Plasma Shield showing up as the second Neron Upgrade, although I was fairly certain that we were all doomed due to the fact that Raulca's last activity had been to sleep in bravo dorm with Janice until Stephen finally kicked her off, and Paola submitting a dodgy-looking screenshot (according to Chun) before she learned that screenshots are against the rules. A few cycles later, I was telling Chun something when I noticed we were back up to two mush on the bar. Apparently, this made Freida panic and sabotaged the astroterminal in a room full of people. I caught her in the act and ordered an execution on her, emptying a blaster I had affectionately named Charlotte. Before she was killed by Stephen in a surprising act of heroism, she brought down the inactive Jin Su. And then fires started. One of the fires happened to break the fire extinguisher AND the O2 tank along with a patrol ship. Chun fixed the extinguisher, and Paola put out the fires. I ate a ration and tried to fix it, watching the alleged success rate rise up to 60-something before giving up and going to bed. By the time I logged back on, I had been killed by mush Ian. Pacifist mush Ian. Pacifist Mush Ian managed to kill me with three unarmed attacks, totally unassisted. (Although the logs say he may have mutated beforehand)<br>So, what went on after that? Being dead, I have no idea, except that Finola tried to kill someone and was killed herself on order of Chun.</p>

                <p>Hey ya, was Finola, actually, the only thing that killed me was the lack of O2...after I killed Paola, Stephen and Gioele, there was almost no one to execute that order from Chun...also, it was me who took anonymush....right after converting Kuan ti....problem is, the poor thing panicked when he saw himself turned, a couple cycles later, and picked anonymush as well <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"><br>Oh, and Ian mutated, that's how he got you, once mutated, I'm pretty sure the pacifist trait was no longer working...<br>Anyway, after you were dead, not much to say...Hua was the first to die from lack of O2, in the meanwhile, I was butchering up Janice too, but just when I was gonna finish her off, a fire burned her to death.<br>Almost got Chun too (Ian got her a couple times, and myself 3/4 times with knife, plus she was in the same room as Janice when the fire started, and I think she was also plated that cycle).<br>That's it! things could have turned better for you humans with a bit more activity (I think I counted 5 inactives this time) better luck next time!</p>

                <p>Yeah, I was fairly certain the human side wouldn't make it to Sol pretty quickly, due to the fact that Raulca fell asleep in a dorm and never logged on again. Nobody else did anything else with Pilgred, I believe.<br>And yeah, you're right. Pacifism is removed by mutating. <br>That Anonymush thing certainly caught me off guard, although looking back I do realize I kind of called something similar happening.</p>
