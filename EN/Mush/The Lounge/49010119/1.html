                <p>My memory is always a little fuzzy after a ship, so let me know if any details are off.</p><p>The first person to strike me as suspicious was Gioele. He wasn't inactive in the literal sense, as in a full AP bar, but he did seem to be wandering around the ship aimlessly without contributing any AP and idling in the Central Corridor. I figured a player moving around but not spending AP is worse than an inactive just sitting there, so I asked Stephen to help me kill him, and he obliged. He ended up human and seemed kind of confused on the leaderboard... I'm guessing he didn't know how to play.</p><p>A little while after that incident, I was suspicious of Kuan Ti. My primary concern with him is that I couldn't figure out where his AP was going. He had his designer points but he never posted in the NERON thread when relaying, so there was no way for us to know he was spending them. Eventually I saw he made a new thread stating the NERON options, so I got the feeling he was spending his points, just not telling us... Talking to a few different people in the dorms, he was sleeping in a bed, too. There came a point where I was in a channel with Janice and Derek and had made the decision Kuan Ti was to be killed, only to find out after going to bed for the night that Derek wasn't sure what I wanted. This ended up being a good thing, as I was feeling wishy-washy, and Kuan Ti had made a second thread detailing the new NERON options. (I have no idea why or how, but we had been discussing the merits of the Blaster Gun and Automatic Sprinklers in the main thread... Only to see that the Launch Propulsion System got completed. Nobody mentioned relaying it. Weird.) After seeing that second thread, we never went through with killing him. I recall that someone was idling in Alpha Bay, and Kuan Ti had moved dorms from Bravo Dorm to Alpha Dorm. (Or vis versa, I forget.) Janice had noticed this and informed me. She was offering up a theory that Kuan Ti checked Alpha Bay to see if it was someone he could infect, only to find it was his partner. I think it was Terrence that she was suggesting was the Mush pair? The whole thing seemed kind of far-fetched to me, as I'd figure Mush would communicate as to where they are... But I just figured she was trying to be helpful. Of course, hindsight is 20/20, she wanted me to want to kill those humans.</p><p>The next player of interest was Ian. He was very helpful throughout the ship. It was his first time playing Ian, and overall he did a good job taking care of the plants. Like most ships, we moved all of the plants into the Laboratory. This means the apron was easily accessible to him when working in the Lab. Early in the game he forgot to wear the apron while relaying research, and got dirty. Later on he forgot to wear the apron when tending the plants. People make mistakes, so I warned him in the Dirty thread to be very careful about wearing the apron in the future, or I might have to kill him, as it's just not possible to distinguish a forgetful player from a Mush doing it on purpose. Around the time of the second Dirty, I also received a report from Frieda (if I remember correctly), who told me that Ian passed through the Medlab. Thinking it's possible he spored Frieda, that was the straw that broke the camel's back. Ian also asked me something along the lines of "Would you really kill me for forgetting to wear the apron?", and that got my me wondering if that was a genuine question or psychological warfare... But either way, that question came about after we had already made plans to off him. Derek helped me kill him using a grenade I had hidden and a blaster, and he was human, and I felt bad. Sorry Ian!</p><p>Unfortunately, for a few days we didn't have any active Comms Officers. Paola went inactive, and then Eleesha went inactive, so by the time Stephen inherited the title there was some catching up to do. I was ready to accommodate Stephen in any way possible if it meant we would get those morale boosts, as morale loss would be hell with two dead and three inactives waiting to die. Janice and a few pills was our only source of morale. I encouraged Stephen to take the Medlab bed and pulled some coffee for him. One of the first trades we got was a crewmember for PILGRED, and although I saw it, I didn't think it was worth asking Stephen to reject it... Just in case we managed to kill some Mush before moving. Once there were a few more trade offers, I slipped into the Bridge again to see what they were. Trading one of the crewmembers for fuel seemed better than letting them die, so I mentioned that to Stephen, and also brought up the fact that the PILGRED trade existed. He might have known already, I'm not sure... But the next time I logged in we had returned to Sol.</p><p>Janice had been Mush all along, offering an encouraging opinion when it came to killing crewmembers she knew weren't Mush... Stephen was also Alpha Mush... And somehow they had converted Jin Su. With several highly inactives waiting to be traded, they had the game in the bag. <br><em><strong><br>Shoutouts!</strong></em><br><strong>Janice:</strong> Nice work. You had me trusting you.<br><strong>Stephen:</strong> I never really suspected you, and knew you were willing to get your hands dirty if I asked.<br><strong>Jin Su:</strong> I also never suspected you, and thought you helpful by letting everyone know when you had extra AP to spend. Thanks for standing around the Lab when I asked even though we ended up not needing the extra AP.<br><strong>Frieda:</strong> Very helpful, brought me the armor, hacker's kit, and the only other person searching for the Mush Sample. At times I wondered why you weren't scanning very many planets, but between piloting early game, searching for the mush sample, and the first set of scans, maybe you didn't have enough AP.<br><strong>Derek:</strong> When I asked for your help killing Ian, and almost killing Kuan Ti, you were there and ready with AP stocked up. Thank you.<br><strong>Ian:</strong> Sorry about killing you. Don't take it personally, you were great.</p><p>Inactives were Paola, Eleesha, and Andie.</p>

                <p>I opened this thread by accident and not because it caught my eye. Not very good AP name. Should be something recognizable with a glance. Like "Mush Jin, Jan, Stephen went to SOL."</p><p>Anyway, thanks for creating AP.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So, Janice here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I open up the game and see Im a mush. I feel like Im getting that role too often and my partner shares the same sentiment. I look at all the "favourite" chats made by Chun filled with directions of how to relay stuff and what not to do, screaming "control freak", and feel like this game will be a nightmare for the mush team. This is not that kind of Chun that gets picked the last from the pool by some noob and does nothing. Ohh no. This is the kind that got picked by a person who knows what he is doing.</p><p>I saw Frieda move around the ship while she searched for the sample and stayed quiet. Didnt really want to waste my energy for that. (My memory is now a bit shattered as its the second ship that played out pretty identically and im currently again on same damn type of ship. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>Im always trying to convert a beta early in the game to greatly increase chances of victory, but everyone seemed to stay under a camera except Raluca, who I felt, would be seldomly checked by THIS KIND of Chun, so going with Stephen to her turrent to convert her would be suicidal.</p><p>Anyway, it turned out this ship was one of those ships where half of the crew does nothing. Or atleast it feels like they are doing nothing cause they are either inactive, like Eleesha (thank god - no list, no way to discover if theres a beta) and Andie (its a win) or not reporting the progress they make. Like Kuan Ti. So research went really really slow. Which was a good thing cause Gioele didnt have extra cameras, and mycoalarms were faaar away in the priority list. Atleast we had that to work with.</p><br><p>I was staying in bed in BD, as there were not much active people to ask me to leave it for them. Especially after Gioele got killed.<br>I was concidering a possibility to try turn Terrence by sporing nexus, as he was actively relaying, but so did Kuan and some other people. No way Terrence would land on all traps.</p><p>Chun asked who was in BD so I replied, and later reported in PM who entered it. Stephen havent entered BD after he killed Gio yet. I was going to switch to AD to let his name slip, even though it was a known fact he was dirty.</p><p>Kuan was really suspicious. Honestly even if I wasnt mush Id kill him myself. <br>He was going in and out of BD but didnt report anything. Sometimes completely missing somewhere Im not even sure where. Never reporting progress is a bad thing.</p><p>When I saw that dot in the Nexus on the map I had a feeling that it might be Chun, or someone else playing as a bait by her request, so I resisted my impulse to go there and spore that person. Glad I did, because Kuan then creeped on Ian that was idling there. Ofcourse I had to report it to Chun implying he might spored poor nerd <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br>Then I saw something funny in the logs. Jin Su, just like he reported, come to BD and kicked Kuan off the bed as Jin was a pilot and needed a bed. So Kuan then goes online and cycle after that kicks Jin Su out of that same bed. Guess it was revenge, as he then left BD. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> That got reported to Chun too.</p><p>Anyway, on D3 we were still at this starting planet, that Terrence along with someone else that idled in IB when the game started recklessly explored. So I asked Jin, who is a new player, in general chat why we were still here. Raluca loaded 1 fuel. I left BD to relay lab research, and while I was doing that I saw that Jin, who had 1 spore from beginning of the game, moved to the bridge. THATS IT! This is my time that I was hoping for, I thought, and selected Infector skill. Went ahead to the bridge, despite there being 4 people already, whom I figured would be inactives anyway, and only Frieda could come later after we jump and notice my short presense. So I come in and give jin first spore. Then I think whether its better to take anonymush first, or later after I convert him. Or maybe I shouldnt take it and he takes it? I give him second spore converting him. I know waiting was stupid but I waited 10 seconds in hopes hed take anon. No. did it myself. Then accessed comms channel as If i was just checking if there were any trades or something, and left to BD. Sure Jin Su was a new player that picked wrong role, but it was a chance I couldnt pass on.</p><p>Chun discussed with me and Derek how she wanted to kill Kuan. Man, WHY THE HELL DEREK DIDNT KILL HIM on the next day. I should have said DEREK DO IT. But, I didn't want to look too pushy so I tried to formulate my view a bit more passively, hinting at that its dangerous to have active mush that has reasons to get dirty and stays in BD bed. I really hoped he would do it, but oh well. Soon enough Ian made his ultimate mistake and his fate was decided. When I saw his reports on 4 broken doors one after another I couldnt hold my laughter. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> Too bad he was smart enough to not do it in lab.</p><p>Anyway, I asked Jin to not do anything suspicious as I felt we had upper hand now. It really felt that the ones who are truly active are Jin Stephen Me Chun and Derek. Others were quiet and semi active.</p><p>Oh, at some point Paola goes inactive and title switches to inactive Eleesha. I knew both she and Andie were sleeping so it was gonna land on Stephen. Next cycle it skipped Andie alltogether and went straight to him. I advised Jin to send missions to him so he could fake eating food and still do his job. Im not sure whether he noticed the Pilgred option himself or was it after Chun pointed to it, but he made this offer to us in mush channel, inviting me to his and Chuns conversation after she left. Poor Chun. She was willing to take that risk and she did.</p><p>Though, at first I rejected. I wanted Chun to kill Kuan Ti, then possibly Terrence, who liked to idle at unprotected places too, and then we could have killed a few people crippling the ship to unrecoverable state. What made me change my mind was that Chun was going to reserve all coffee to Stephen, and there as a possibility shed figure out something is wrong, as he wont do the coffees. So I didnt want to loose a fellow mush, plus, I felt bad for that she had to cope with half active crew. It was just like Frieda said. The ship would just drag and drag with little progress and no purpose. On that previous semi inactive ship I mentioned, mush went to SOL too, and I felt he did us all favour.</p><p>What do you think is better, death of whole daedalus or coming back to SOL with 3 mushes intact to infect it? Ofcourse second option. So it was decided. Jin said he was going to be on on C8, but came on C1. I was crashing but waiting for him. I wanted to murder Chun to make it more dramatic. A backstab she never saw coming. Yeaaaah. I was thirsty for her blood. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>All 3 of us are online. I repeated plan a couple of times. I mutate, slaughter Chun, then Stephen does the trade, then Jin Jumps us to sol. I come to lab and execute my part, using last ap for the final blow. BAM. Chun is dead. Stephen makes the trade aaand.... Nothing. Jin is offline. We start to panic. Where the hell is he? Did he go to sleep? I just killed CHUN, I was a horrible purple monster in lab, Stephen had traded Andie for PILGRED damn it, we were outed and JIN SU was OFFLINE. We were one click away from victory and anytime Humans could have changed the endgame to their favour. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Stephen goes to guard FC while we wait. Spent 10 minutes I think refreshing the page to see that we finally jumped. LOL</p><p>Jin Su reminded me of this guy Chao, that was our commander. We all agreed we are going to SOL with 3 or so hull left before asteroid/hunters hits us. And what do you know? He stayed quiet untill the last minute countdown. Then he jumped us. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I hope to see Chun again on some active ship when im a human. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Actives who deserved to die:<br>Ian, Kuan, Terrence. Not sure about Gio but no cameras = death. <br>Other suspicious people: Frieda<br>Inactives: Paola, Eleesha, Andie, Hua? Roland?<br>Not suspicious people: Raluca</p><p>Derek doesnt fit in any category somehow. (Not a bad thing.)</p>

I definitely was a bit of a "control freak" that game, I figured if I could scare the crew into believing little slip ups would be the death of them then they might play well. Didn't seem to work, hehheh. I was just tired of playing ships with Chuns who don't do anything, and figured I could do better. It was a pleasure playing with you!</p>

It totally makes sense now that Stephen never came and took the coffee.</cite> Yeah the way you said it looked like you were basicly forcing him into food test. He had to eat rations and now that coffee. One cant just take it from lab and say he drinked it, cause apron is in the lab so why not drink it there on the spot and protect yourself from dirt. Atleast Derek used D4 coffee.</p><p>The biggest mystery of the ship though...</p><p>Why, and how the hell did they manage to do LPS when we did not even saw it as a good option. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> Mush had nothing to do with this.</p>
