                <p>Janice here. What a wild and crazy ship this turned out to be. Alpha Mush were Roland and Raluca. Crew was exceptionally alert. Stephen our Chef killed Gioele by mistake. While this was going on Raluca kept trying to convince the crew in private chat to kill Jin Su. Derek was suspicious too as he kept holding on to the Apron and not dropping it. Anyway the Mush eventually decided to rampage. Raluca snatched Andie's body and took off in a ship. Roland tried to kill Raluca's old body with Andie in it but failed to finish the job. He also took off. Gear stolen included the med kit, compass, a fire extinguisher, and one unknown item. They took a Patroller from Bravo Bay and the Scrap Ship from Alpha Bay Two. Crew were planning to try and do the RFS Serum and turn one Mush back into a Human and kill the other by doing the Magnetic Net project (it was actually Magnetic Return in NERON). Anyway Jin Su comes online and realizes both Mush are outside. He moves the ship and "poof" no more Mush. KT and Stephen are both so mad at Jin Su they want to kill him. Hua plays peace maker and while he calls Jin Su "a smug git" he talks them out of lynching the Captain. So now we hace 13 people left (Andie (Raluca), Roland, and Gioele are dead).</p>

                <p>Lately my ships have all had half the crew inactive. Not this one. Only Chun was inactive and ended up being the only other person to die (starvation) despite Ian being down to 1 health, and Jin Su down to two health, and many of the rest of us at less than 5 health multiple times. I think we missed the Med kit the most due to the damage we took. We were fortunate to have a shrink book and an astro book so our crew actually had 3 Astros and 2 Shrinks. Jin Su also had leadership but only used it a few times as he and Hua were the only Pilots. Hua was probably the MVP on this voyage as he definitely kept people focuses and healed. Freida was the other MVP nominee. Not a surprise as later on I learned she had played as Janice on another great ship I was on a while back. Raluca was incredibly reliable on the coffee machine and Paola worked her magic on Comms. Terminal getting us Plasma Shield early on. I can write more but hope others will reply to the thread first before I add more about the voyage.</p>

                <p>Jin Su here. In all my voyages I have never had the pleasure of killing both Alpha Mushes at the same time with a single action. Imagine if you will that you are the Captain and you come online to find that your crew is contemplating a very high risk series of actions designed to "save" one of the Mushes by turning into a human using the very player who has just been body snatched and more than half dead from combat damage administered by the other Alpha Mush. Furthermore they are talking about finishing Magnetic Net when it is Magnetic Return that is the project in NERON (incidentally we did get Mag Net as virtually the last NERON project). So where was I... Lets see move the ship and kill both Mush while losing the Med Kit and the compass (Diplomat lost for sure unless we convert Andie back to human) or leave the Mush alive while trying to coordinate what is at best a 1/100 long shot. So I moved the ship and killed both Mush in one blow. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Anyway I got the most interesting reaction you can possibly imagine from my crew... So as not to spoil the fun in this thread I will let them tell you what happens next... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Furthermore they are talking about finishing Magnetic Net when it is Magnetic Return that is the project in NERON (incidentally we did get Mag Net as virtually the last NERON project). So where was I... Lets see move the ship and kill both Mush while losing the Med Kit and the compass (Diplomat lost for sure unless we convert Andie back to human) or leave the Mush alive while trying to coordinate what is at best a 1/100 long shot. So I moved the ship and killed both Mush in one blow. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Anyway I got the most interesting reaction you can possibly imagine from my crew... So as not to spoil the fun in this thread I will let them tell you what happens next... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></cite><p>no... Just no. There was zero risk of us losing anything other than some o2 from waiting. And we were aware it was magnetic return we wanted to try for it. Had we been successful we would have had a diplo and either medkit/compass (i forget which andie took.) We might have made it to eden with that advantage. Instead you decided you were the decision maker for everybody and didnt even need to consider discussing anything. You definitely deserved to die for that, and probably would have if it wasnt for our pilot situation.</p><p>You were the low point in this ship.</p>

                <p>Hi all, Hua here.</p><p>The major issue with your action Jin Su is that you were aware it was against the wishes of the crew and you did it anyway.</p><p>Whether or not the plan would have succeeded or we could have made it to Eden with Andie on our team, is irrelevant. You knowingly 'played against the team.' I concede that you did successfully kill both Mush, so as far as it goes it put us in a good position, but I reiterate; we had made plans to do something else and without discussion you vetoed those plans. That is why people were upset.</p><p>In the future if you want to make these sort of executive decisions it is much better to play it as an accident ("Oh My God! I moved the ship and only <em>now</em> am reading about your plans! I'm so sorry for not being aware of them!!" ) rather than what you did which was "I saw your plans and thought I'd do my own thing anyway." <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Of course if we'd killed you for it we would have been in a much worse position and certainly would not have made it to Eden (in my opinion), so I'm glad you lived and in the end I thought you did a good job as commander, letting us know when you were available and keeping the ship moving and hunter numbers down. I can also understand why some people won't forgive you for your actions. The death of the Mush in that manner certainly coloured the whole journey.</p><p>Besides that I enjoyed working with this crew, even the quiet ones (Ian, Eleesha, Derek) stayed active and followed advice. It was a pleasure working with such an active team, probably the most active ship I've ever been on! Sometimes I wish there were no Mush and the game was simply about surviving against the ship for as long as possible, but that would be a different game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Looking forward to playing on more ships with you all into the future and thanks for all the missions.</p>

Playing against team is to hurt them. If you are sure, that you know better then them, what needs to be done, you can do it. And you don't need to lie about it - do what you see right and explain youself is better.</p><p>First of all it matters if humans wins (and even return to Sol without cure is one), and then goes all "greedy" stuff like cure, Eden, etc. You can get those without risking basic victory - then do it. If you have option between "kill all mushes instantly and have PILGRED fixed in few cycles" and "leave mushes alive to do anything, because it will probably allow to get few more items" I cannot blame anyone to ignore others and just do everything to win the game.<br>Second - his choice happen to be right, as Magnetic net came as <strong>last</strong> project, so we would need to abadon them to get O2 anyway and he saved lots of time.<br>Third - if mushes did not want to be pulled back - there were a lot of things they can do - they can just eject and make it impossiable to return them and items, mushes can return on day change and spike 4 times. Waiting is really not an option at all, if it takes more then few cycles. If magnetic net was already avaliable - then to rush it would be great.</p><p>Personally I was afk when all that stuff happened but in his situation I would do quite the same - I would post all that in game chat, explaining why I cannot agree with your plan and abadon mushes. Maybe I would try to convince you before doing so, but anyway - would not wait more then a few cycles.</p>

                <p>Really interesting thread! I am not part of your crew BTW. So let me get this straight your captain killed both Mush by abandoning them and your sore at him for not talking to you about if first? Essentially it sounds like the decision was the correct one. Isn't kind of hard on the guy to bust his chops when he got you all home safe? Even more amazing is that the one guy who killed a human is getting a free pass in your thread. I would like to hear your Stephen explain why he bumped off Gioele and did that get cleared with anybody? Also it doesn't seem like your Mush hunters were doing their jobs if the Mush decided to rampage before you knew who they were. Having said all that I wish I had been on your ship. Great voyage all of you. My ships lately have been completely lame with so many inactives...</p>

                <p>Also regarding Gioele's death - At the time the 6 confirmed humans decided that Gioele was the most likely Mush suspect.</p><p>Gioele was inactive with no skills selected until sometime in day two, when he selected Paranoid and installed only one camera. He worked on Nexus, but it was unclear how many AP he used and he returned to Bravo Dorm where the only shower was located. He never said anything in chat.</p><p>As a Mush Gioele has a pretty terrible selection of skills, Solid is bugged, Coffee addict is useless, Astro is probably the best case scenario, but we already had two active astros and Gioele may not have been level 4 yet. Paranoid is the least damaging skill for a bronze Gioele, so we took that as a suspicious choice, especially as we had already finished MycoAlarms at that point in the journey.</p><p>Stephen had the authority of the known humans to assassinate Gioele. It turned out he wasn't Mush, but he was the most suspicious of the people in this crew.</p><p>--<br><br>Again regarding Jin Su, the biggest problem was the way he explained his actions. He could have made a strong case and won over the crew (much like Frieda has already in this thread), OR he could have claimed ignorance of our plans and made it seem like a mistake, but his explanation came across as selfish and ill considered ("Oh, I saw your plans and decided to do my own thing"<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">. I agree in the end it was probably the right choice, but it could have been played much more diplomatically.</p>

I do know for a fact that Janice (WhiteRook) told me after they were dead that one Mush (Raluca) tried very hard to convince people to kill me... As to the question about our Mush Hunters I can categorically state that our Chun was completely inactive and useless. Our Eleesha was a brand new player on her first voyage. Everyone on board will agree I think that for a new player she did remarkably well but obviously had no clue about her important role as a Mush Hunter. The actions of Gioele are already documented as are Stephen's. So in effect the normal Mush Hunting crew were not available to us on this ship.</p>

To be honest, we had initially planned to hijack the Technician book and rush PILGRED for a serum-less Sol jump, since it'd technically still count as a Mush victory. The character pairing was quite poor, since Roland is quite an AP intensive guy, while Raluca is the AP starved gal.</p><p>Humans were incredibly on the ball right from the start, getting ASG done within like 1-2 cycles from selection, and CSS within a few cycles more. Really made things difficult for the <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"> team.</p><p>Roleplay-wise, one of the best ships I've ever had. I enjoyed playing/rping with those who did, with special mention to Stephen's 'special' meals and tendencies.</p><p>I found Terrence and Jin Su to be mostly counter-productive, pointing fingers and throwing blame left and right...which we were hoping would lead to getting 'em lynched. But with the ever-tightening noose, one human getting proven after the other, it was a matter of time before we were found out. Really made me worried when KT almost got Eleesha to print.</p><p>Ultimately, eloping with the goods was all we could do. Lack of AP and the accidental screwup on Raluca's part made stealthy operations impossible. So meh, good job humies, hope you enjoyed the Mushroom stew. It was very fun a game to play!</p>

                <p>Hi All,</p><p>Raluca/Andie here. As for a word from the Mush, Roland (Sapphy) Is being beyond generous. I was the Leroy Jenkins of mush on this ship. Beyond, even, as I didn't even have chicken. It was my first time being Mush, my 8th ship (If memory serves), and my first time playing Raluca.</p><p>Most of my failings come from having less knowledge about the mush side of Mush, but also with the activity level of this ship. Getting most if not all of the antimush research done by D2 really takes the sport out of it, at least for the mush. I totally understand it, as if I were human I would have been directly on board, but when that happens, often you leave mush to the generally frowned upon tactic of "take the pasi, as much useful things as you can carry, and die". Frieda was a bit terrifying, as she seemed like she would be an AP/MP counter, and likely to check me after a shower. I had to take splashproof, a generally less used Mush skill because it doesn't do much, so that was one of my skill slots down to something mostly useless.</p><p>I managed to have an okay start, as I spored after getting dirty from pilgred, and trapped IB when taking the compass in there for the first expo. Andie was spored once from that. I pointed you towards Jin Su, mostly because if I were human, I'd have suspected him-Impromptu trip to the engine room? Trying to get Raluca on an expo? No sir.</p><p>From there on, I made some huge mistakes. I didn't realize that eating didn't give mush any AP-I just thought you couldn't double eat, so D3, when I knew I should be getting hungry, I ate. Oh no-No AP, and I knew this crew would notice the AP lack, as I had already spored twice. Had to take another not-so-great skill, Phagocyte, and make do. I also trapped the engine room to try to work on conversion for Stephen, who was, at the time, the only confirmed human. Had he checked pilgred like I asked, we could have body snatched both him and Andie and things would have been different. Unfortunately, he trusted me and did not check Pilgred, and we discovered that injecting fuel also does not trigger a trap--Surprising for me. I then had to trigger my own trap so that no one wonder why I was letting Pilgred points go to waste. <br><br>I decided to play human as best I could for a bit to get you off the trail, though Roland urged me to focus on a Pilgred rush and get the hell home. I'm sorry, Roland. We totally should have. During that time, Roland also told me that Stephen suspected I had two mush skills-Phagocyte and Splashproof, and I did. There were also other talks of my mushy-ness, so I began to get paranoid-This was an extremely active crew, and I knew my number was up. <br><br>My plan was to set off the grenade, try to dismantle the shower with tech points and a few AP to help protect my partner, and then jump into Andie and murder myself, hoping they would have enough AP or some stored missions to get the job done. As we all know, this was an epic fail. The grenade was a complete waste. The shower would not dismantle. I forgot to drop my Trakie. I failed to kill Andie. I tried to grab the apron so I could at least take it with me, but alas, someone was holding it. I had no choice but to grab what I could, jump in a patroller, and wallow in my own failure. It was my version of "LLLEEEEEROOOOYYYY JAAAAANKINNNNS!" I did manage to alert Roland in time for him to productive, grabbing actual useful objects and fleeing the ship. <br><br>Afterwards, I got to watch the crew criticize me. In the future, perhaps some compassion? We all have our moments where the game pisses us off or gets us angry, but remember, you don't know what my situation was like IRL or in the game, so being a jerk about it does nothing. <br><br>All in all, this was a fantastic crew. I am sorely disappointed I couldn't be a human part of it, but I appreciate the learning experience.</p>
