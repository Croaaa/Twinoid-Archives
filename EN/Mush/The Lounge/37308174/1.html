Once Mush gets a grip of it's head, the body falls into submission.</p><p>So, Frieda once stepped out of her cryo-pod a late afternoon and looked around in the Daedalus. Many of her crewmates had already awoken and was running around doing all kinds of great things on the ship, we'd found two sofa blueprints, hunters and shower was sorted out. Heck, someone even had invested some of their precious Klix coins to get the <em>Noise Reducer</em> gold upgrade.</p><p>Frieda was pleased, and dozed off for a while on the Bridge...</p><p>...<em>and didn't wake up. Something else did in her stead, a certain fungic parasite.</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Not only that, but the other Mush agent had awoken in another member on the Bridge, Paola. Their proximity made their pheromone-based communications resonate with both joy - and frustration. How would they spread being so concentrated? Besides, why did they get inserted in such unfit host bodies? They understood from reading their host bodies' memories that no-one would find it credible if they left the Bridge or got dirty. How would they pull this off?</p><p>By abusing their proximity. And the element of boredom through stealth-mush skills like splashproof. Things are standing so very still until the Mush are dead. It must get really lame for the humans.</p><p>Sooner rather than later people just stopped reading the logs strangely, and we could uninstall the camera on the Bridge without Jin Su noticing when he passed by. It didn't take long before we had our first beta Mush.</p><p>Then Frieda's Astroterminal broke - <em>crap!</em> Now they'll come up here and notice the camera is gone.</p><p>They didn't. Terrence came up after a while to repair the terminal, just to find the machine full of spores, as well as his crew mates. Our second beta appeared.</p><p>Meanwhile, the humans down in the Dorms were blindly killing each others, we abused this to direct them towards killing Eleesha so that her list wouldn't interfere with our stealthiness.</p><p>Social engineering is a beautiful thing.</p><p>Day 6 - We were 4 Mush, and two other crew members had been spiked once through Frieda's traps. It felt like people just stopped caring, so Frieda could run around and relay, move things and refuel the ship without anyone giving a damn.</p><p>The two people that had been spiked once were Hua and Stephen, and that day we had 4 spores. It was either to convert both of them or Chao with the Natamy Rifle. We decided to convert both of them and with their help, we rushed down Chao before he could fire at us, and then proceeded with killing the remaining 5 crew members (Yes, the humans killed five of their own).</p><p>The ship was ours for two hours before being flushed into space by NERON.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/frieda_bergmann.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FB:" class="tid_ico"> Frieda, the main dirty worker (funnily enough) here. Good game, my fellow Mush, and Paola my Alpha comrade. Not a single Mush casualty! We did good.</p>
