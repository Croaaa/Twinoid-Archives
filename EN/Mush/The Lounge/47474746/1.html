                <p>I can't decide if RNG loves me or not. Another active ship, 100 planets found, but no luck with maps - <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7949" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7949</a></p><p><strong>Briefly about the ship.</strong></p><p>Plasma Shield as a First project.</p><p>Mush hunt was short and, like, crazy-active. We've got 4-5 negative results from the list, including Eleesha, and boy, Eleesha was active! Actually, mushies almost hadn't a chance. Firstly we killed Gioele, he was really weird, but human. Stephen was strange AND mush, Roland was good and sneaky and had a nice plan, he just couldn't do it alone with his skills. I think more than half of the crew were confirmed humans (some from the list, some from illnesses, they've got after Steven's and Gioele's deaths). We've rushed RFS, secretly, but Roland wasn't stupid. He was in the Lab, when it was finished, even helped with that, trying to gain some trust, that could give him a bit time. His plan was to convert Eleesha (who has 1 spore on her because of a trap) and ask her to <em>heal</em> him and live happily ever after. But we cured him first. Actually, we wasn't sure if he was a mush, we just really din't wanted him to be. We have some suspects and we were ready to kill anyone but him. We were only 2 Pilots, me and Roland and ofc, we both were awesome. So, mush cured, Eleesha-confirmed-human can't print The List, we were free.</p><p>Frieda passed away at the middle of the ship and despite that we have an active unskilled scan team (100 planets in 18 days), we couldn't manage to find the right planets. 2 expos to Volcanoes (no, I don't have U-Turn, we were just brave and reckless), first gave us a map (although not from Cristalite) and the second one - mush trap.</p><p><strong>As for THE CREW:</strong></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/kim_jin_su.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_KJS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>JIN SU</strong>, also known as cap Koala. Long story short - I killed him on D11 or D12. Not that he was THAT bad, he was just half-inactive. We discussed that option from beginning of our Journey, and he was arguing with us, that he was active, just in a different time zone. That's how he's got his second name, coz he decided he was from Australia. Then, he had <em>inactive</em> status twice in a row, and he just came back to get his title back. Which was sad - Chao was very active and we needed to move. We talked to cap Koala and explain him, that we need someone, who can be there at least 3-4 cycle per day, no matter if it would be first or last cycles. He didn't listen and I killed him. We didn't said he was bad or something and we kindly suggested to take another character next time, if you could be online only once per day. Now I've read his last words and I feel bad, that we didn't kill him earlier, this man has no heart. Sure, we killed him, but we were nice to him and wished him the best.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/frieda_bergmann.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FB:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>FRIEDA</strong> did her best with scanning, but unfortunately, she had to leave in the middle of the game. She died in the Corridor. Even her last inactive days were planned for our ship's good. She stayed here, so Terrence could move for free.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/janice_kent.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JK:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>JANICE</strong> did all the organizational work. This girl was active as hell, she was almost control freak. She updated all threads, she research and report about all the possibilities we've ever had somewhere, expo team was always prepared the most effective way. That was a TON of work. She is one of the main reason, we've got this far.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/roland_zuccali.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RZ:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>ROLAND</strong>, also known as Gastroland. Such a jolly boy, with a dream of lighting his cigarette from a Volcano. Ultimate Hunter destroyer, part of our legendary expo-team and a part-time healer. It was really to pleasure to play with you! Great RP.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/paola_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_PR:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>PAOLA</strong>, thanx for all your Comms work and for your selflessness! I know it could be boring to play Paola on a longer ships, especially if you have no other skills. And I appreciate A LOT, that you always gave your bed for our scan-team, no matter if it was Bridge or Medlab or Dorms, when we needed it there. She is part of our scan-team as well, anytime, that she had AP for that.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/wang_chao.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_WC:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>CHAO </strong>, our Pony Commander, Shooter-Shrink. Was one of my favorite players on this ship, thanx for your RP. He was great as a Shooter, he was great as a part of our expo team, and he was great as a Commander, after he's finally got his promoooshn. Too bad, that he returned us to Sol without a proper discussion. Yeah, I guess we wouldn't reach Eden, but we could easily reach D20, it was only few cycles away. I don't care about D20, but it would give Chun her second ticked, so she could play in Russian speaking castings. I guess, he just panicked, we were almost out of Shield, too many injuries and so, but that was a really bad decision (mostly because you didn't wait for anyone to vote). Besides that, you were awesome. Still I'm very disappointed, that we didn't reach D20, mostly for Chun.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/finola_keegan.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FK:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>FINOLA</strong>, our Medic and one of the scan-team, were good in both. Also, thanx for RFS rush and all those pills and your activity in general. It was pleasure to play with you!</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/stephen_seagull.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_SS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>STEPHEN</strong> I actually wonder if it was some kind of suicide? He was mush and he was obvious and strange and his last word are a bit suspicious.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/ian_soulton.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_IS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>IAN</strong>, also known as King of the North, has all these crazy skills, so we were safe with mush infections. Also, he has a strange love for weapons. He tried to take as much as he could in our expo, so Janice were grumping constantly, because he didn't follow her well prepared instructions. We've got a ton of Pots from our Botanist, but almost all of them were destroyed in fires pretty early, so we've left with only 4 (2 for Ian and 2 for me). Unfortunately, Ian wasn't very accurate with his AP on our later days, so we had a little arguing, which ended with him refusing to discuss anything with us and his vote for Sol.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/zhong_chun.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_ZC:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>CHUN</strong> was a ghost all the first half of the game. She walked, she did some Projects, she ate and she randomly healed people. She was silent. Until! Until I organized Brain Damaged Therapy channel with her. I asked her to stop eating and asked her to stay in the Dorms and heal people. So she did. Then my Brain Damaged Therapy channel increased. I invited Terry (also silent-ish and doing random stuff) and Janice (to help me with organizing both of them). And we found out, that Chun <em>can not communicate</em> (her own words). She is Russian and she didn't feel very comfortable speaking English. So I asked the crew to speak as simply as they can with her, and BOOM, we had another active Nurse aboard! She started to take care of people, she did what we asked and she really helped us a lot on a later days. I'm sorry that we didn't reach her earlier. And I'm sorry that she didn't have a chance to get a second ticket, because she knows about her language problems and she knows about castings and she tries to get into one.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/raluca_tomescu.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RT:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>RALUCA</strong> was a real, antisocial Raluca! Even if she slept too many time in Dorms (safely for her, we had 2 Shrinks). Great RP, I'm so sorry that she was unlucky to have all this injuries in one cycle. She was great, and one of my favorite players on this ship as well.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/eleesha_williams.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_EW:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>ELEESHA</strong> was super-active at the beginning. Walls of texts in the mush hunting chat! Fast and glorious hunt. Unfortunately, she wasn't enable to be this active later, coz she was travelling and had a bad connection. She did, however, help with scanning and Tech issues, so she was a great help anyway!</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/terrence_archer.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_TA:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>TERRENCE</strong> was another slightly brain damaged boy, part of my Therapy group. He was a really great help at the beginning, with all that Project work and drones. But I guess he didn't know what to do on a later days, and he has some language issues as well, so he just started to do some random useless door fixing and other stuff. Right after he was invited to the Therapy, we've found an understanding and he helped a lot. Unfortunately, he died from injuries. Again, I'm sorry we couldn't reach him earlier, he was willing to help and to communicate, but I guess it's too hard to follow all these messages (yeah, we were pretty talkative) in the main chat, if you have some language problems.</p>

                <p>Hi, Paola here. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I was third to awake. Moved around some things and had some pre-game fun with Roland, when the rooms didn't have cameras yet. (he later turned out mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>I was hoping to be full AP when the last person awakes, but the ship filled sooner than I expected. Last person awoke D1C8 and Finola got up the Connection within the same Cycle. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>The signal quality wasn't very good (4%) I was afraid that it may break randomly on cycle change, so I decided to rush Xyloph, to either contact Kivanc or get rid of one of the bad entries before the first base showed up.</p><p>I did 6 scans in C8 (10 saved up ap + 1 ration): NERON (didn't do any Upgrades yet <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico">, List (5-6 confirmed <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico">), Cook, Blueprints, Disk, Kivanc</p><br><p>We were discussing multiple possible mush suspects - Roland was the main suspect, because he was using a bed in shower dorm, and missing hp often. We had other suspects, but Roland being mush and having to kill one of our Pilots was the worst possible scenario.</p><p>didn't plan to continue Xyloph at this point.<br>The only things missing were Ghost Chun, Ghost Sample and Mage Books + 2 chances to lose the signal. We had found the sample, Chun was alive and I wasn't really interested in getting the Mage Books while mush are still alive and could steal them, so I was focussing more on Bases and Neron.<br>But Eleesha convinced me to continue with Xyloph. We needed Ghost Chun, because Chun wasn't in the lab, and we were not able to reach out to her yet.<br>Well, good thing we had such an active crew. I lost the connection twice (hit both bad Xyloph entries) within the same day. Both reconnections together: 7-8 trys - so half of the crew had to help with reconnecting - Thanks for that. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I then focussed on Neron Upgrades. I got 4 projects. I think I would have been able to get more, but we had a very good Nexus team, so there weren't many projects left when I had Neron Level 5. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8743784 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8743784">noctober</span></span><cite>:mush_mush_tease_PR: <strong>PAOLA</strong>, thanx for all your Comms work and for your selflessness! I know it could be boring to play Paola on a longer ships, especially if you have no other skills. And I appreciate A LOT, that you always gave your bed for our scan-team, no matter if it was Bridge or Medlab or Dorms, when we needed it there. She is part of our scan-team as well, anytime, that she had AP for that.</cite><p>You call it selfless, but I didn't really have that much to do anymore. Xyloph and Bases were done, no projects left in Nexus and I even managed to get Comms Expert distinction. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I wasn't bored at all, we had very nice, active crew and the RNG was at our side in the beginning. <br>we had some good projects Plasma Shield, LPS, Blaster Gun, ...</p><p>I am just sad that I didn't get to leave the bridge very much, but in the end I even got to join an exciting Volcano Expedition. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We had very good chances to reach Eden, but RNG wasn't really on our side when scanning. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br>We didn't find any Cristalite planets and the few Cristal planets we did find had Volcanoes or Seismic or did not have any Cristalite at all (sorry for that one.
