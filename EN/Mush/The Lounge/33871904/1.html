                <p>Janice here.</p><p>The game:<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1293" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1293</a></p><p>What a round that was. We started off pretty well, but between a prematurely slain, innocent Captain <em>(Rest in peace, Jin Su, we miss you! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico">)</em>, both Technicians turned Mush and killed, a sporadically active replacement captain and plenty of inactivity, there was not much hope for our rag-tag party to make it to Sol or Eden... although we did find a fragment of the starmap! Some emotional moments were had, and friendships as well as rivalries (Looking at you, <em>Paola</em>) blossomed during our 8-day-long voyage through the stars, until it all eventually came crumbling down on *Day 8 - Cycle 4*.</p><p>I want to thank all the active players for sharing this voyage with me; it was my 2nd truly active round, and I've learned a lot about the game as well as made my first foray into Mush role-playing. We held on by our teeth, and it worked out pretty well despite all the setbacks, even though by the end it became a bit of a drag (but only because of gameplay systems). I have a feeling that I won't find a crew this good again in quite some time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Alpha Bay 2 -- Day 8, Cycle 3</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><em>Janice</em>:<br><em>&lt;sighs&gt;</em> This is it, then...?<br><br>It's hard to find the right words... this was a rollercoaster ride, wasn't it? Everything in my life up to this seems so small and irrelevant compared to what we've experienced together in this last week. And, sad as it seems... it's such a fitting, dramatic way to end, isn't it? Maybe one day they'll have a novel, a movie about us, when humanity has fought back and defeated the Mush...? At least I hope so...<br><br>Thank you all for everything... <strong>Hua</strong> for her cool, level-headed wisdom, <strong>Finola</strong> for her expertise and activity, <strong>Chun</strong> for all the little ways she helped me out here and there, <strong>Eleesha</strong> for her expert tracking without which we wouldn't have succeeded against the Mush, <strong>Ian</strong> for being there when I needed him most, and for helping out with NERON and being my only source of Morale... <strong>Stephen</strong> for the way he tried to help as best as he could, <strong>Frieda</strong> for her expedition assistance and <strong>Chao</strong> for well, uh, being there sometimes...<br><br>And <strong>Paola</strong>, well, we've really had a <em>unique</em> relationship, but in the end I'm glad you always had that <em>little</em> bit of trust in me and never went too far. Your harshness and your sharp thinking really helped keep us all on our toes, so thank you. And you made for a fine captain, let me tell you that. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"><br><br>I do not regret serving with any of you, listening to your problems and helping you where I could, and I can only hope that you return the sentiments. <br><em>&lt;sniffs&gt;</em> It's been an honor.</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Janice Kent's final iTrakie diary log</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Throughout our journey, the crew was in good mental health and processed the stress of the situation well. Even <em>NERON</em> has lost some of his edge as we came to realize our journey was about to end, which I appreciate... that way we could all spend our final moments in a sombre kind of peace and quiet.<br><br>I'm so sorry, Roland... I wish I could have been there for you.<br><br>To anyone who finds this... beware of the <em>Mush</em>. Don't let them fool you... <strong>fight back</strong>! Succeed where we failed! <strong><em>Find Eden!</em></strong><br><br><em>- Janice Kent<br>Crew and AI psychologist</em></span></span></p><p>If you have any comments on my play, criticism on what I could do better, suggestions, praise etc, please let me know! I'm always yearning to improve and to make the game more fun for everyone involved. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>(Hoping Jin Su's player finds his way here, because the sad way he went out, right after donating the <em>ACTOPI Protocol</em>, really got me! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> He really didn't get to enjoy the game much...)</p>

Then I take decide to make a long run based on anonymush. Raluca spoils everything (she didn`t read My messages and took anonymush too after some 2hours from infection). I was amazed that so easy everything cool down and I got wide open field to operate.</p><p>Most precious moments for Me were when I have to fight not only with You suspiscious humans, but most of all with Myself.

                <p>Hey, Eleesha here! This ship was fantastic and I'm so glad I was able to be a part of it. I'm sure if we had't lost our technicians and pilots to the Mush we could've gone much further, but this has been my favourite run so far. It's actually a shame because I know I won't be getting another ship this good for a long time. Don't worry Paola, I don't blame you for being paranoid and Roland, you are one sneaky Mush! Janice, Finola, Hua, Chun and everyone else, you are all fantastic. Thank you for such an amazing game.</p><p>And R.I.P Jin Su. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Paranoid Paola here.</p><p>First of all my sincere apologies to Jin-Su, who as you may have gathered now was rather mercilessly killed for a series of apparent mistakes that made me add 2 and 2 and somehow get 5. This was the first time I killed an innocent in error and it was extremely painful, and I hope the last. I'm not going to name names, but this was not a unilateral decision I took, but I'm happy to shoulder the burden of responsibility. By the way the topic title was my idea as we wanted to honor you.</p><p>This was a journey filled with many joys, lows and ironies. Some of the more memorable moments for me :</p><p>* Being 100% sure that Jin-Su was mush and taking matters into my own hands and then finding out he wasn't. Although it happened early in the game it completely changed the mood of the game and really set the stage for the rest of the journey and some of the tensions and challenges we all faced together. The sillyness was over at that point, and it became serious.</p><p>* Me not realizing what 'paranoia' actually did and then believing that Janice was in the room controlling my speech somehow and having a 20 minute monologue crazy rant whilst everyone looked on perplexed. I remember thinking as a player at that point that I would want to kill me if I was playing one of the other crew.</p><p>* Scanning a planet for the first time with the last of my AP and finding Oxygen when we had 2 units of O2 left and Frieda and other crew had been trying for days with no luck.</p><p>* Long after we thought all the mush were dead I refresh the screen to see a mutated mush standing in the dorm with me. It took me about 5 seconds of just staring to process what I was actually seeing.</p><p>* All of us running around the ship doing jobs we were not trained for or accustomed to with the very last of our AP pulling the ship through one crisis only to land straight into the next. I think we dodged certain asphyxiation twice and several meteor storms with less than one cycle to go.</p><p>* Chao whining about his broken foot whilst lying in the medbay as we were dodging one of the aforementioned crisis with Janice desperately trying to hack the bridge console in time.</p><p>* Hua (our only active pilot) landing about 3 seconds before Chao kicked the ship into high gear a cycle too early without any warning at all.</p><p>* Me accusing Janice of being a mush every time she tried to help me with an act of kindness. At one point I was so sure she was trying to trick me I prepared an elaborate trap for her and wasted a whole bunch of MP on it. All because she offered to move across the ship to help me with my morale and offered me coffee to help with my duties. How you put up with me I don't know Janice!</p><p>Good times, crew. I'm sad we lost the will to make it back home, although it would have been a long long trip before we could have repaired the Pilgred.</p>

                <p>Hi everyone I was Hua. <br>I'm glad to have being able to do this trip with you. That's was a great game, lots of very hard moments: when we nearly reach 0 oxygen or when I was trying to find desperately more AP to kill all these hunters... Hard to survive but we managed to be alive for 8 days with a good team spirit.<br>That's a shame that we lose our great Commander (and also pilot) so early.</p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Alpha Bay 2 - Before the end of the world - Day 8, Cycle 3 </span><div class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Now, that’s my turn to say my last words. Hum it's very hard, I don't think I'll be able to do better than Paola and Janice but let's try. It was very nice to meet you; this travel was plenty of fun, surprises, help and cooperative work. I think we (nearly) all have done a very good job and some of you have been very versatile in order to help where it was needed, fun to see Chun as a technician <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Paola</strong>, happy to not being your enemy, you’re a very good shooter and also a good manager, you could have done a great shooter pilot if only I had time to explain you how to pilot. <strong>Janice</strong>, I you’re the queen of the hacker kit, thanks to moved us and saved us during all these desperate situations. <strong>Finola</strong>, good work at the research, c’était un plaisir de servir à tes cotés ! <strong>Eleesha and Chun</strong>, you were the technicians of the ship, thanks to you our trip has been longer, it’s very hard to repair all the equipment when each cycle everything is being destroyed little by little. <strong>Ian</strong>, thanks for the beautiful plants and the help in the research. <strong>Stephen</strong>, thanks for your help in the destruction of the hunters and your meals were delicious (for the situation). <strong>Frieda</strong>, not there so often but you found nice planets, I wish you have helped me sometimes with the hunters as you were a pilot too. <strong>Chao</strong>, thank you for being there and trying to do your best. <br>It was very hard being the only active pilot; I couldn’t manage to destroy all the hunters so thank you everyone for precious your help at the turrets.</span></div>
