                <p>So! I honestly didn't intend to join this jump - have a lot on my plate offline and planned on a bit of a break. But... I couldn't not check my choices, eh? Eventually, I saw them line up with this ship, when it was only Eleesha, Jin and Chun left. Well, I'm not allowed to Eleesha. Chun was really tempting to go with, but as I was sitting there debating whether I wanted to join at all, she was chosen. With Eleesha off the table, I impulsively snagged Jin, and proceeded to pretend I wasn't on a ship for most of its duration... not that that was a long time. :v</p><p>I didn't really have a particular Jin in mind, he's not one I really play a lot. I tried to go with charismatic and a little bit light, completely polite but with an undertone of 'I will not hesitate to cut you if you are out of line.' Bit of an odd balance to find, not sure how well I did with it. I picture Jin Su as the sort of charismatic bastard who keeps Chao around to have a monster to unleash on his enemies and keep his own hands clean. A monster he's very fond of, apparently! My Jin definitely had a giant boner for Chao this ship. Bunch of innuendos, and Chao never discouraged it so... heh.</p><p>I really enjoyed coming up with little quirks. The Commander Cookies, for one. I meant to drop a pile of post-its detailing who had earned how many Commander Cookies and why throughout the journey. It was going to be a mix of deserved and arbitrary based on Jin's whims, with negative cookie values as well. But the ship ended so suddenly, didn't get a chance.</p><p>Also really enjoyed posting Commander Wisdom and the daily mission text. Didn't save the Wisdom thread but hope people enjoyed the advice and musings posted there. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> Did save some of the missions!<br>Didn't save day 1 or 2. Day 1 Finola got a mission apologizing for the whole kidnapping thing and explaining why he felt that giving that order was in the best interest of humanity, asking her to assist with research. Day 2 went to Chao, forget what it said. <br><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/a9cc8985d3f9286dc3f45118f04cf09b.png">Day 3: Chao's deal with the devil</a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/463d1849ec1726a246268e0531e188dd.png">Day 4: Encouragement for Stinky Roland</a><br>Hua got Day 5, looks like I didn't save it. It detailed some of the reasons why Jin admired her though, and I was hoping to build off of it later.<br><a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/f085517564f7b72bd730875d5bf7f8de.png">Don't die, Chao, I'm not done with you yet!</a></p><p>Also enjoyed the crew, despite a bit of friction here and there. Chao and Hua in particular were great. Frieda stole Jin's Cookie idea, and was mean to him about it to boot! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/angry.gif" alt=":anim_bad:" class="tid_ico"> She lost so many Commander Cookie ranks for that! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/cgu.gif" alt=":anim_chart:" class="tid_ico"> ... until he realized that it must be because she was secretly in love with him. Oh myyyyyy. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink2.png" alt=":wink:" class="tid_ico"> Didn't really get a chance to interact too much with Finola or Gioele but they were fun too.</p><p>Coupla things-<br>I couldn't believe how long we sat at that first planet! I hadn't even wanted to go there in the first place because it didn't have O2 and didn't look <em>that</em> great, but people insisted and Frieda stopped looking for another. Then we were there for a day. I was sooooo frustrated. Moved us there, went and idled in IB, since we still had mush alive and I'd need to go on the expedition. I had to go to work though, so announced that I was there and ready but wouldn't be able to launch. Checked in throughout my work day and ... nothing happened. Come home, and nothing had happened. We couldn't assemble a full team of 4. Meanwhile, we had 10 hunters beating on our armor since we'd gotten there, which I'd hoped wouldn't be a big deal, since, you know, expo and run, then deal with hunters after. Since that hadn't happened, hull was dropping fast. But I hadn't had a bed and had previously loaded fuel and moved the ship, so I was only at about mid AP. One of the other pilots took out some but still the other half pounding away and third pilot out of AP as well, so I selected shooter (I tend not to take skills until I need them), quietly popped a vending machine food item (we were out of rations) and took care of it. Totally spent after that. As soon as I was rested up again after, <em>finally</em> managed to rally a full team and get that planet done. Then the planet was largely a dud. Oh well.</p><p>Chao - I saw later you had asked Hua why I'd suspected Kuan Ti? Mostly, he raced to IB whenever I asked for an expedition team, almost immediately, so he was definitely active and reading. But he barely spoke and didn't seem to be spending his energy much of anywhere useful. Huge red flag there. Also, Ian, Roland, and Stephen all felt human to me for various reasons, so process of elimination sort of thing. I'd have told you directly if you'd asked. ^^;</p><p>As for the ending. Oof. That planet. Holy- I hope that bug gets fixed. Ending a really promising ship over a bug is sad indeed. Although I will say, from a RP standpoint, rallying the crew to save Chao via serum rush and return to Sol was fun. Not as fun as seeing where things could have went but, ah. Got to spout a bunch of valiant 'no one left behind' type stuff, heh.</p>

                <p>I was pretty upset about that first planet too, but there wasn't much I could do about it. And while it would have been fun to go farther, things were starting to feel dry. I am kind of glad it ended, not because its over, but because the way it ended was reason for some really great laughs!</p>

                <p>Mushy Terrence here.</p><p>I think I have already told my story to most of you but I will repeat in here.</p><p>Day 1. I was chosen alpha mush in a hyperactive ship full of TE members. Yay! A challenge! At first, I saw Kuan Ti idling in the nexus without a camera and I planned to rush convert him with my infector but I checked the mush channel and he was my mush partner. Time to change my objective and I see that some people asked me to move a camera from the medlab to the nexus. I do that and infect Finola twice hoping that my partner could finish her off and we delay research that way.</p><p>I waited three cycles but my partner didn't answered me. When he did it, he said that he was missing AP so I planned and counted what to do for him. I counted every single AP and MP, the route, what to do in every room and what to answer if people asked him why he moved that way. I gave him the location of the scooter, leave him two spores to extract, told him I could take anonymush instead of him, etc. He said that it was a good idea and a good plan but he didn't move. I waited for one or two cycles more and he said again that it was a good idea but didn't move again. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>At this time, you were finishing ASG and CS. I didn't want to waste those spores and planned to finish Finola myself on D2C1 using them so I took fertile. NOPE. Fertile only works on the first spore of the day and this one would be my third (even though it IS the first spore after I took fertile) so it didn't work. Stupid bug... So I healed myself (also a big mistake), took a bed in AD and stayed there.</p><p>Suddenly, Chao picked torturer and started to have fun with us. After torturing Eleesha, Jin Su and someone else (I think) he came to visit me. It seems like my 12th and 13th actions were "infect" and I was killed. D1C8. I couldn't even finish Finola and I guess my partner didn't even try it.</p><p>Lesson learned for next ship: If you have a torturer Chao in your ship and you are mush, always wake up using the "get up" action. That way, it will appear in the torture log and you can hide more secrets in there. If you don't use that action, it's missing there. Not like it could save me, but I like to think I learned something.</p>

But he barely spoke and didn't seem to be spending his energy much of anywhere useful. Huge red flag there. Also, Ian, Roland, and Stephen all felt human to me for various reasons, so process of elimination sort of thing.

                <p>Hmm... hard to say. The way he talked, perhaps? Another mush hunting friend and I were trying to hash out a similar issue in the past - we were on a ship together and I was convinced someone was human, he was convinced they were mush, we ended up curing them and yep, human. I think, the conclusion we came to then holds - I'm more likely to assume human but poor play than many hunters I know. But....although there have been times I've been wrong when I thought someone was mush, I've yet to be wrong when I do get a 'this person is human' feeling so... Heh. I tend to rely on social cues a lot, and back it up with logs whenever I can.</p>

That way, it will appear in the torture log and you can hide more secrets in there. If you don't use that action, it's missing there. Not like it could save me, but I like to think I learned something.</cite><p>If I saw someone using the 'get up' action I would probably try to dig even deeper instead. The self-heal was what felled you though because I had checked your HP from before the Mush woke up and when you then lied about it later I had to investigate. I think a good lesson to learn is that you should always expect Chao to have Torturer and plan your actions far ahead to get as many actions in as possible and preferably after Chao has wasted his actions on someone else.</p>

Sorry it's taken me so long to write this; we're moving and packing/unpacking is taking up most of my time.</p><p>First off, this ship was the ship I've been longing for for quite some time, offering the perfect balance of RP and getting shit done (except the lull before the first planet, which even made me wonder if our dear Commander was Mush for a moment... sorry <span class="tid_user tid_user_1268679 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1268679">Rain</span>).</p><p>I loved the way the various RP-ers got into character and kept it going, working together to meld stories while not letting the RP take away from what was actually happening on the ship.</p><p>The one suggestion I will add is this: One player on the ship told me they don't believe they should have to communicate about anything except the Mush hunt. That's not cool, especially in a cooperative game. Work with your people! If you're reading this and are that player, you were active and helpful, and I wish we had heard more from you. I do look forward to shipping with you in the future and getting to interact with you!</p><p>Flash (I'd tag you but there are A LOT of flash's in twinoid apparently), I must say that as our Chao, you were my absolutely favorite part of this ship and had me cracking up throughout most of it. Everyone else was brilliant and awesome as fun, but for this Hua, you were the perfect counter-personality. My only regret is being murdered by space rocks before we got to see how things from the planet played out. I hope to ship with you again, and soon!</p><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_3553328 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="3553328">fishehh</span>, that planet...Trying to kill us all!
