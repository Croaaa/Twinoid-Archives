So I was quite surprised that he didn't continue the sample-hunt and finished his short trip in BD. <strong>Medikit</strong> was in BD, so I checked him and got #1 target for elimination (he had no full <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"><strong></strong>).</p><p>At the same time, <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/finola.png" alt=":mush_finola_50:" class="tid_ico"> <em>Finola</em> made a post that <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chao.png" alt=":mush_chao_50:" class="tid_ico"> <em>Chao</em> walked through Medlab.

                <p>Ian here. Great ship, indeed. Sorry i wasn't that active as i was before mush-free, but this game thrills me only when there is still mush on board! Playing against PVE, meh... At least our Jumpkins were in perfect condition every evening and garden upgrades did an amazing job to give the crew extra AP. Thanks for the journey!</p>

                <p>Chao here. From now on i know the medikit is dangerous to early spores...<br>I dislike rampages enough to not go for "as much damage as you can". I tried to learn the mind games as they seem to be mroe fun if they are succesful. Not to mention i kind of managed to end up on same ship as my real life partner. Which could make things complicated(it were complicated enough at the beging and i had some real fun not telling her anything else.) I gratz you all to making it that far. you had some realy nice ship and iam glad you killed me so fast.. cuz i believe i would ruin it for you sooner or later &gt;.&lt;</p>
