                <p>Geez, forgot the character limit. Anyway, Commander Jin Su here. Our mush were Roland and Gioele, whose last moves were to kill Terrence and Hua. We managed to survive to day 11 before jumping back to Sol with 10 living crew members. Altogether I'd consider that pretty successful considering we didn't have a shrink pretty much the entire time.</p><p>I'll go into more detail later if no-one else does.</p>

Don't You think? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Anyway...</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> here. Not much I can say about this ship. And honestly I have no idea if it deservs an AP. Sure, there were few intesresting moments, but ship in general was PvE based due to early rampage done by Mushes (which was caused by Gioele being found out really quickly by Chao with Torturer skill). I will never ever forgive Roland killing Terrence. But... That will have to wait for untill I will come back from work. So later today. Yes - even though I said that this ship not necessary deservs AP, I will participate in it if it already is, and will wright what is worthy of mentioning in my book. So... Till evening? I think so!</p>

                <p>Ah yeah. I had even pulled up the end page to give the link and totally forgot.</p><p>Anyway, I've had a lot of AP worthy ships that never got threads because no-one bothered to make them, so I'm resolving to make sure there are APs for my ships so long as they last... say... 10 days? 10 days doesn't seem too awful a cutoff for that I think.</p><p>ESPECIALLY since you rarely ever figure out who is who on a ship until either an AP thread is made or it's been long enough for the names to show up. And by then the ship isn't worth talking about even if it WAS notable. So if for no other reason than that I suppose I consider it worth making an AP thread, even if it doesn't result in much. (AP threads are sometimes the best parts of the forum anyway. And it's not like this section is overflowing with APs. So I don't see the harm in it.)</p><p>Anyway, I do agree nothing really special happened on this ship despite having 10 active players alive until the end. I'm learning that being told I'm doing my job wrong as Jin Su is just... normal. Someone is always gonna say I could have done something better. And in all honesty, Finola might have been right and we could have had everyone pair off in the medbay and bridge for morale purposes. In my experience that rarely ever works out in a way that doesn't leave a couple people scrambling for morale, but I'll admit it was <em>possible</em> to save myself the AP. I just figured it was better to have at least half the crew doing okay on morale so they could do their jobs without us having to deal with a literal clusterfuck in the medbay.</p><p>Anyway, I didn't even use the pill for about a day after that, and we still had another pill that we never ended up using. So it all worked out in the end either way. If other people honestly think I shouldn't have used that pill it'd be nice if they spoke up. Because like I said: I seem to get the "you're wrong" posts a lot as Jin Su. So it's PRETTY hard to take them seriously.</p><p>On one hand, I did need that Morale, but on the other, I didn't end up dropping another speech for the rest of that ship. Had we continued past day 11, I probably would have since Frieda was in a bad way at that point, but there really wasn't reason to.</p><p>(I did use the vending machine to buy some food to move the ship at that point, though, and make sure we didn't take too much damage. I'll admit I've been shooting for gold tickets on my ships lately, so those 4 tokens were worth it in my opinion. I left a lunchbox with two charges in Bravo Dorm and I never really went back to see who ended up using it. Doesn't matter to me, though. As far as I'm concerned it helped us get gold tickets, so I'm alright with whatever happened to it.)</p><p>Plus I know at that point there was still some paranoia over the possibility that there was an anonymush on board.</p>

Right after cycle change Roland went rampage: I updated the page, both me and Hua were dead. He indeed took a grenade. Frieda was online and quickly tracked Roland to the Bridge. Second alpha was shortly eliminated.<br> <br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"> After 3 pilots perished, an obvious plan was to rush pilgred, and come back asap, but ship was able to survive until day 11 and get the ticket.

It was fascinating how we were doing our usual crew work, while playing out that devious romance, involving love, hate, and mush paranoia. Raluca, my love, you brought so much color to this, otherwise usual, trip! Thank you for that!</p>

                <p>Hahahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> TerryMerry! You made me laught yet AGAIN! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> What a splendit way of taking part in AP <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> So funny <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Especally how You decided to include Eleesha and Janice - two inactive characters that not only didn't done anything benefical for ship, but also done something wrong... Like grabbing Sofa BP and going inactive on bridge to steal Paola's Logistic Bonus! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Anyway... So fun to see You active here! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Was it just for me maybe? Hmm? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway... Let's start with actuall AP, shall we? As I said, and had been seconded by Jin Su - this ship didn't done anything special, like loosing all members of expedition due to volcanoe, or having many infected crew members... Nothing speciall... But it DID had interesting points <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Commander Jin Su already pointed out that there was some late game paranoia. And He was right! I was paranoid about somebody... And not only I was paranoid one... Right Commander? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But first things first! Jin! I for one had never ever said anything about You doing Your job badly! In my opinion You were doing Your best to keep this ship together as long as it was possible. I still remember Your conflict with Finola! It was... Strange? Well, if You ask me, I thought back than "Just let Him swallow it!". From my point of view it was more important to keep You Commander alive so you could give more speeches across ship if needed. So I did agree with You there... Finola's idea was too idealistic if You ask me. Though there was one reason why not to swallow that pill! It was best target for Mush to triple spore. And I had no idea if Roland's or Gioele's activity could grant that possibility or not. So I am glad you choose to not use it in the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> From what I remember at some point I decided to join it by simply saying that as long as PILGRED is not operational, I am most important person on Ship and You two should keep that in mind <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Honestly - despite me trying to put some sense of humors into it, I really ment what I said <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> It was back than at 26% if I remember correct and I didn't got any relays, was having morale problems (thanks to TerryMerry I felt much better than others did though) and our hull was getting torn into pieces since we had only 1 active pilot... Which was You Commander <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> So without me that ship would be most propably lost - Tech Book and PILGRED Trade are not something one can rely on after all, as big amount of luck is needed for that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> But not tha is important realy - important is that after my mention I did got relays from Chun and Finola-Jin Su fight had stopped. So it worked! Or was just a cooincidence. Never mind <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Anonymush Paranoia...</strong><br>Ok! So... Terrence said to me that He is worried about Frieda... So idea was simple - Frieda could be anonymush. And honestly She found us rather weak planets (bad luck by RNG!). There were few good ones, but not much. Also I rarely saw Her being in monitored part of ship AND almost never got possibility to simply check on Her activity logs... Now Terrence was killed by Mush and was proven humman! So... What He said about Frieda was totally worth of my concideration! Moreover when Frieda did something, She was doing it loudly. "One coffe drunk due to starvation!" - just when we got our two Alpha Mushes killed, She was saying about such things. How it looked for me? Like that "Look! If there are any Mushes left, and I am not saying they are! But if, than it is totally not me. Nope! I just was starving!". Same went with morale - there were people with less morale than She at some points, though She was laud one about it. And now most important - SHE WAS GOLD LVL 4 FRIEDA! GOLD! So She could have really great potential to hurt us badly, to spread infection unseen or to play humman and return with us unnoticed... Also, She did looked more active pre-mush selection than after that occured. All that put together DID made me paranoid about Her! And Her constant asking Ian to do the thing... Why Ian? Because of pacifism of course! Better to give spores with lower cost..</p><p>I was bugging Chun about Frieda. I also was talking with Jin Su at some point about Her. I was paranoid about Frieda, but NOT TO THE POINT TO KILL! I didn't had any solid evidence. All I had was bunch of speculations...</p><p><strong>So... End of my paranoia...</strong><br>So after around 9 days spend in space our research team completed RFS. I quickly contacted Chun about it, grabbed RFS and after reciving green light I simply inoculated Frieda. She was humman for whole time. Since that moment I was calm and totally ready to return to Sol <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I never mentioned to anybody that I used RFS on somebody. Only I and Chun knew about that officially. Maybe She did told to others? Maybe people saw logs in lab and me picking it and could somehow deducate that I inoculated Frieda? Lot's of "maybe" here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And here I do wonder... Was anybody paranoid about me being anonymush? ^^ I would love to hear about that if so... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I'll admit I had considered the possibility that you were anonymush around the time I was dealing with everyones morale. But after I had spent so much time in Alpha Dorm with NO camera and kept scanning myself and finding zero spores? I figured the ship was probably mush free. At the very least the people who had been in the back of the ship could be trusted.</p>
