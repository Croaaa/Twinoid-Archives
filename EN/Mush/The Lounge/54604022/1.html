                <p>Hey guys, <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"> here from this ship:</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9694" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9694</a></p><p>This ship ended up being a really great one and it was, without a doubt, my best ship since I started playing the game.</p><p>I don't know much about whatever happened pre-<img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"> as I was the last one to wake up on Day 3, half an hour before the start of Cycle 4. (funny enough, my only selection currently happens to be Eleesha again). I was human so I decided to look for the Mush Sample. I found it a couple of minutes later in the Front Corridor. After delivering it to the Lab and doing various things around the ship such as moving things, pushing the Anti-mush research and trying to establish the Sol connection, I decided to camp in B Dorm.</p><p>B dorm was pretty crowded a lot of the time. We had an idle <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/raluca_tomescu.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RT:" class="tid_ico"> in a bed, <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> stuck in there too since she couldn't leave Ralu alone, <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/wang_chao.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_WC:" class="tid_ico">, myself and various pilots going in and out. Chao was swift to start torturing anyone who came in but, since I was human, I was in the clear.</p><p>The Mush hunt wasn't going very well because there weren't many suspicious movements to track. I, of course, kept my eye on various people as they moved because they managed to do some pretty stupid things that could have been done by a Mush. My suspects at the time were <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/ian_soulton.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_IS:" class="tid_ico"> and <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/stephen_seagull.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_SS:" class="tid_ico">. They both made a bunch of mistakes that could have easily been interpreted as Mush actions. Poor Ian messed up so much that he got himself one hair away from being lynched. He got tortured by Chao so much that the poor guy went down to 3 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> at some point and was ready to die. His salvation, however, came from one of the Mush themselves, funny enough. After a day and a half of peace and quiet, our first Alpha Mush, Janice, decided to act. She shot our poor <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico"> then mutated and tried to kill Chun. She was quickly disposed of. And the quiet times returned.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/finola.png" alt=":mush_finola_50:" class="tid_ico"> and <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"> were both swift in completing a lot of research really fast so our remaining Mush would have had a bit of a hard time should they decide to act. Finola's Xyloph list cleared a few names and both <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/roland_zuccali.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RZ:" class="tid_ico"> and I were proven human via illness. So now we had a little Mush hunt channel, but no clue as to who was Mush. Eventually, I took it upon myself to find the remaining Mush and I looked through chat logs and room logs and then I kept wondering what prompted Janice to attempt a rampage like that. And then the answer was right there, in one little line in chat and in the uneventful ship itself. I swiftly shared my theory with Chun and, together with the other people from our little Mush Hunt channel, we decided to kill Raluca. So Chun kindly directed me to the location of the Natamy Rifle and I proceeded to swiftly assassinate Ralu who had moved to her usual Turret shortly after Janice's death. Sure enough, Ralu was Mush, just as I thought so I rushed to the Bridge to try and print THE List only to confirm my thoughts that we were Mush-free.</p><p>This is how things unfolded in my head as I tried finding our second Mush.</p><p>1. The main reason <strong>ANY</strong> Mush rampages early is the fact that their partner is inactive/unresponsive. Janice acted early and was pretty swift in her actions. She was aiming for our Morale sources. Her killing Schrodi was the first clue towards the identity of her partner but, at the time, we didn't think much of it.</p><p>2. Shortly after Janice's demise, Ralu came back from being idle and, against all of my expectations, she wasn't very fazed about losing her cat. At first I thought that maybe her being with Janice meant she had a full <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico"> bar but even so, anyone in her position would have most likely made at least a bit of a fuss over the significant loss of Morale. Yet she didn't. She just moved to her turret and proceeded to go somewhat inactive again.</p><p>3. Using the first argument and adding it up to the fact that Raluca was pretty much the only person who was outright inactive and then her lack of reaction to what would have been a significant Morale loss, gave me all the clues I needed to suspect her. Luckily, Chun and the rest trusted me and we got rid of the Mush. Chao hated me for taking his kill tho <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As soon as we were Mush-free, I swiftly devised a plan and assigned roles to people based on their skills and specialties and we decided to try for Eden. What followed were 9 crazy days of fixing things, scanning, completing ALL of the available research, going for all the Neron projects we chose, putting out fires and healing one another. I ended up being a Chef and, later on, picking my Level 4 skill in order to hack things as, at times, people weren't available. Since Jin was our only permanent morale source, we had to resort to using the medlab a few times (hence the title of the AP thread) and we kept hogging all the morale pills and fruits and the whole ship was literally crazy when it came down to Morale. It was a Morale rollercoaster and I'm being 100% serious. Our Morale would spike to max or drop to like 2 and then spike again. Fino and I even got junkbumpkinitis after we finally replaced all of our fruits with jumpkins and, towards the end, people were pretty much fighting over the darn things "oh, someone downed all the Jumpkins", "are there any jumpkins left?" and so on...</p><p>At the end of Day 9, our lovely ship looked like this: <a href="http://prntscr.com/b99lov" target="_blank">http://prntscr.com/b99lov</a> / <a href="http://prntscr.com/b99mgt" target="_blank">http://prntscr.com/b99mgt</a> and we had found our first map fragment on an expedition. By Day 13, things looked like this: <a href="http://prntscr.com/bak7z1" target="_blank">http://prntscr.com/bak7z1</a> / <a href="http://prntscr.com/bak844" target="_blank">http://prntscr.com/bak844</a></p><p>We scanned for many many <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/planet.png" alt=":mush_planet_scanned_1:" class="tid_ico"> and even ventured onto Seismic Activity planets in search of the coveted map fragments but, eventually, RNG was against us and we either found bad planets, no cristalites or cristalites ended up being Mush traps. At the same time, we were being ravaged by <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"> everywhere and breakages and steel plates, room shakes, electric spikes and so on. We ran out of food too and, by the end of the voyage, all of us were drained of AP/ MP and the Morale kept dropping. Given all that and, after losing Roland and Gioele to inactivity and in an attempt to avoid anyone else's death due to panic attacks and/or steel plates, we decided to return to Sol.</p>

You did research and lots, lots, LOTS or <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> runs.

I think, if we had a repairs &amp; fire extinguishing olympics, you would have won the Gold.

Oh my god, that was love at first sight for me. You were, BY FAR, my favourite crew mate this voyage. You stayed on top of your game with all the comms work, you went for favourable trades and, when the comms work was finished, you took it upon yourself to become an Astrophysicist and scan for planets and then, later on, you even joined expeditions. You were an absolute trooper and I swear, I totally loved you on this ship. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/stephen_seagull.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_SS:" class="tid_ico"> I had to take over Chef duties since you decided to use your skill slots on better choices. I haven't interacted with you much, but you were always there, moving heavy things, joining expeditions, putting out fires, repairing things, you name it! You were a jack of all trades, master of none and a valuable member of the crew.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/wang_chao.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_WC:" class="tid_ico"> you were incredibly active early on and totally scared Janice into rampaging with all of our torturing. Towards the end of the ship, you sort of faded away but, whenever you were there, you were forever keeping busy with all sorts of things that needed to be done.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/gioele_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_GR:" class="tid_ico"> and <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/roland_zuccali.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RZ:" class="tid_ico"> you guys were nice and useful whilst you were there but your deaths really hurt us, believe it or not. We could have used the extra pairs of hands and well, it showed, especially towards the end. I'm sorry the ship wasn't deemed worthwhile enough for the two of you to stick around. In case you had important, real life related reasons for your inactivity, I apologize for my previous statement.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/raluca_tomescu.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RT:" class="tid_ico"> in my eyes you have no excuse for bailing on your Mush partner like that. Again, you might have had real life related reasons for your inactivity, but it wasn't cool anyways.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/janice_kent.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JK:" class="tid_ico"> I'm sorry you were driven in a corner and forced to attempt a rampage. Honestly, not having you on board in the long run proved tricky. It was quite hard to maintain our Morale whilst taking care of everything else as well. For all it's worth, I would have loved to use the serum on you instead.</p>

                <p>The amount of detail and storytelling that Orianna provided, I cannot match, so I will not even try to replicate it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I was Chun in this game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> It's a character I love playing but often don't, as I am not good at Mush-hunting whatsoever. It turned out it wasn't really needed this game, with Janice being forced into a rampage by the crew activity + the efficiency of the research team + her inactive Mush partner in Raluca. And then Raluca came online, only to go afk again right after. It was sad that this happened, as we had a plan to cure Raluca and could have easily done it, if she was not brain dead <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I do have to make a special mention regarding the people I worked with the most: the Mush hunters in the form of Eleesha and Chao, who where really incredible, and I have no doubt would have cracked the case even in both Mush were active and teeming in the shadows; and to honor Finola, my loyal germophobe and hardworking Research partner in crime, and Ian, our lovable and incredibly prone to make bad decisions botanist who I knew had the heart in the right place <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>I could mention everyone one by one, but Orianna already did, and we all know we all rocked our respective fields! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This really was a fun ship. The amount of active crewmembers is what made is so enjoyable, it's nice knowing the stars can align and you can get a ship where activity is not an issue at all. Everyone was at the top of their game without a doubt. It's true, towards the end a couple people fell off the face of the earth, but I guess I can understand that not everyone likes playing after the Mush are dead and it really just becomes a routine of rinse and repeat in terms of what you have to do. It's too bad we couldn't make it to Eden, it would have been the perfect ending to an almost perfect ship.</p><p>However, nobody can deny the bravery needed to go back to the Mush infested Sol to provide the resistance with the cure! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>
