To be honest, I think us having less actives was actually what helped get us through. Given how the RNG works with the amount of actives, it only makes sense. We definitely took advantage of our luck, though and kept pushing and working on Pilgred. If we had taken it slower and more carefully, I think it would've only hurt us.</p><p>Oh and lets all say hello to <strong>Griefer Hua</strong> who killed our only tech: Raluca. She is part of the community here and will likely read this. Well you failed, Hua. You cheated the game for your own trollish kicks on a ship that would be easy to ruin and you still failed. You must be extremely embarrassed.</p><p>As for the Mush Hunt... It was interesting. We had a lot of inactives but half of them were starving so we were able to cross off a fair few people from the list of potential candidates. Then Gioele double ate, desperately trying to get us an Oxygen planet. Jin Su accidentally misclicked a ration and ate it a cycle after I witnessed him eating a pill so he became confirmed. Myself and Stephen were eating often to cover important things that normally other characters (who were inactive) would handle. So it was pretty much down to Paola, Eleesha, Derek, Frieda, Kuan Ti, and inactive Terrence.</p><p>I had worried about Gioele staying in AD with Frieda and Derek. When you have so few actives and nobody has a reason to go to AD since everyone has their own bed, it's a scary thought if you have two mush in a dorm with a confirmed human. I had theorized that it would easily be possible for Derek and Frieda to convert Gioele openly and none of us ever go to AD to see the messages before the day deletes them. Luckily we did convince Gioele given my theory about Frieda and Derek possibly being mush would ultimately be correct.</p><p>We had to think quick and act quicker. With so few actives and it being clear that we had AT LEAST one active mush (Inactive Janice got quarantined), we had no room to play it carefully. We started talking about purging the most dangerous of potential Mush, Derek. He was active but had done very little. After staying in a dorm for a long time, he loaded fuel, built the sofa, and only put one hit into Research before leaving immediately, despite me being in the room waiting to relay someone. Jin Su misses my message about Paola being injured BEFORE the time she was supposed to be starving and invites her to our very sensitive private chat. Fearing that we have a leak (If a mush sees that we're about to start a purge... Oh boy), I open another chat to decide on how to react to Paola. Luckily we waited because she came online not long after and got Finola's list which informed us that both Paola and Eleesha were not Alphas. Dodged a bullet.</p><p>We then proceeded to kill Derek with less evidence than I would ever have to kill someone over but it was a pressing position to be in. The only other people were newbie Kuan Ti (less likely to be mush), inactive Terrence (set to be quarantined, wasn't a danger either way), and pilot Frieda (We needed her). We made the right choice and Derek ended up Mush. I went to bed.</p><p>Next day, Frieda had panicked about her suddenly-murdered partner and took Terrence. She destroyed our shower and flew off in the pasiphae with our apron and wrench. I wanted to have a nice conversation and joke with her a bit more but our last mush was revealed and we had an easy way to kill her. We couldn't waste any time with games given our situation so we left her rather quickly. Frieda, you didn't make a bad decision. While I would've opted to kill someone rather than take off with equipment, you made the choice you thought was best at the time and I respect that you acted because you likely would've been killed by the end of the day (or cured if we found some majestic way to gain AP for me to rush RFS).</p><p>So all our mush were dead and Eleesha decided to commit suicide by eating Janice's remains (-4 morale). Definitely suicide given the fact she didn't like that we were roleplaying (who plays a text game and not use the text for fun?) and the fact that she didn't even use the 6 AP gained from the organic waste. From here it was all about rushing Pilgred. We had set times where our awesome newbie Kuan Ti and Gioele would work together, then later me and Stephen. It's honestly pretty crazy how 4 people managed to rush Pilgred together. The rest of you "doomed" ships keep that in mind. 4 People, 3-4 days. Just need to manage AP.</p><p>The RP was a lot of fun, too. Watching Gioele deal with his daughter and the Commander. My love the Communcations Console... If we reached Friday for the second date I had planned to change the relationship status to: It's complicated. I also ended up being able to play with NERON in the end, always a treat.</p><p>Great game, loved all of you. I definitely had no intention on joining but I stupidly decided to check my selection and was FORCED... AGAINST MY WILL to join.
