                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1873">Day 20 Return to Sol</a></p><p>I was Chao and didn't even need to torture anyone, that is how badass this crew was!</p><p>this was an MMM ship, and when we jumped, 10 of us arrived on a ship with 6 newbies and it began. I shall give a brief breakdown of the characters to set the stage for the whole story.<br>(<em>It is possible I may of mixed up some newbies with MMMers, it was over 20 days ago hehe</em>)</p><p><strong>The Newbies</strong><br><em>Roland</em> said hello and then wen't inactive on the bridge, stole many AP from Paola's Logistics before eventually dying of starvation part way through day 7.<br><em>Raluca</em> was semi-active early on, getting Pilgred past 40%, but then also died of starvation.<br><em>Kuan-Ti</em> began as bronze and bought gold mode at level 3, he contributed a lot to the crew but later became only semi-active and sadly burnt to death.<br><em>Janice</em> really grew into her role and was a valuable member until she was lost on an expo.<br>It took Chao awhile to accept her death, as she was such a useful team player.<br><em>Stephen</em> rarely logged in, wasted majority of our rations, the Diplomat mage book and then got killed by falling ceiling. The memorial we held for him was short and full of laughter.<br><em>Ian</em> was the first mush and chose to be predominantly silent, taking care of the plants and laying low, but was discovered by Eleesha and Chun, then killed by Chao with shooter points.</p><p><strong>The MMMers</strong><br><em>Jin-Su</em> was an enthusiastic and sincere captain, although wasn't always as active as needed to be. On our final expedition he gave his body (and life) to the horny Mankarog to save us all.<br><em>Eleesha</em> was a powerhouse of a player, hunting mush, tracking item locations and organising the crew better than any other, with refreshing thread ideas and a ton of information.<br><em>Chun</em> was also a fantastic player, chaining Lethargy for 18 days? taking care of our crew's health and also assisting with a ton of other duties, she was everywhere we needed her to be.<br><em>Hua</em> was our primary Pilot and was an absolute beast, occasionally broke a bed or two but always found a way to clear the skies of enemies, and assisted with the gardening late on.<br><em>Chao</em> was made obsolete as a mush hunter by Eleesha and Chun, but was able to find other ways to contribute to the team, performing repairs, gardening and tracking item locations.<br><em>Finola</em> managed the research efficiently, took on healing duties throughout and later became a key member of expedition teams with her diplomatic skills. Almost lost her on final expedition.<br><em>Paola</em> completed all the Comms and DBs except 1 that was unfortunately lost when we moved the ship. I am unsure what other duties she assisted with but she was active the whole voyage.<br><em>Terrence</em> was the second mush and we cured him after restricting his actions severely. He had already done so much good even as Mush and was a great addition to the team once cured.<br><em>Frieda</em> was our original planet scanner and backup Pilot, and handled both as best she could. May not of stood our as clearly as others but was an active and important crew member.<br><em>Gioele</em> started by helping others when needed, later became our main planet scanner and was often seen all over the ship handling whatever duties were prioritised. Creeped on Finola daily.</p><p><strong>Beneficial stuff</strong><br>Chun with Lethargy and Shrink book.<br>Gioele with Caffeine Junkie, Astrophysicist and a fixed Pilgred.<br>A cured ex-Mush Terrence, the only technician we had.<br>Completing both Fire Detector and Plasma Shield.<br>5 Drones. Upgraded with turbo and working tirelessly.<br>(<em>Robo Fido #27</em> - <em>Robo Paul #39</em> - <em>Robo Tiger #54</em> - <em>Robo Dave #95</em> - <em>Robo Paul #70</em>)</p><p><strong>Artifacts</strong><br>2x <em>Invertebrate Shell</em> which actually got a lot of use via Shooter points and occasionally AP.<br>2x <em>Printed Circuit Jelly</em> were only found once all Neron Projects were finished.<br>1x <em>Holographic Alien TV</em> got used as a morale boost by most of the crew.<br>1x <em>Alien Bottle Opener</em> was found late on, but still got used heavily with the Wrench.</p><p><strong>Final Notes</strong><br>I want to share some of the cool stories that happened onboard and of course the mush hunt but I will wait until others have told their side of the story (or I will share if no one chooses to)</p><p>and I will be back later today to share some of my own personal highlights, emphasis on high!</p>

                <p>Heh. For some reason mystery (for now) Chun noted just before she took us back to Sol that she'd look out for the AP thread but probably not participate in it so you'll just have to settle for hearing a bit from Eleesha.</p><p>The first thing I d like to note is that I've waited 'till the weekend to say anything about this ship because by the time Day 15 rolled 'round it was damn near killing me and the second I spent my last 2AP on failed Hull repair attempts Day 20 as we were coming down to crunch time I collapsed straight back into RL with a vengeance!</p><p>I've always had a big goddamn problem with being an addictive or obsessive gamer (started as a teen when I'd methodically put together 1 metre x 1 metre nerdtastic maps of the MUDs I played in and continued MT-style when I became the unemployed <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_basic.gif" alt=":hordes_hab:" class="tid_ico"> 3 season leader of a D2N meta) and I've fought like all get out to not do that now that I'm no longer a jobless bum but pretty badly fell off the wagon here (and the way I was playing there was me struggling with all my might to <em>not</em> participate too much!).</p><p>Saddest moment for me along those lines: 3 fires burning on the ship for over 30 minutes. I <em>could</em> go put them out with my last drip of AP but I just put a bunch out last cycle and I'm considering it a test of will to make someone else do it instead. Then when I can hardly stand it a minute more I start drafting a post to tease someone else into the task (I'd actually already typed "♫ The Ship ♫ The Ship ♫ The ship is on fire. ♪ We don't need no Hull strength let the m*th*r#^%!$ burn ♫ Burn m*th*r#^%!$. Burn.), when Terrence resolved the dilemma. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Special notes of game-obsessive apology go to Jin Su who got cajoled into logging in like a crazy man after being more like a once-a-day-er in the kick off and became great at communicating when he couldn't be around; Janice who was trying to study but was drawn in probably more than she'd like but always to my secret obsessive gamer joy and Kuan who got gold on his first ship 'cause we made him feel like it was worth it just through sheer demonstrated damn-giving for the ship even if he then dropped away due to RL.</p><p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Barring the handy Premonition confirmation from Chun all of my Mush hunting was all log-reading and searching. In Log I Trust and I had an Excel sheet with running logs for the whole ship so that as I kept my own running notes of evidence if I had to present the logged support for a suspect. The first flimsy suspects I had were actually Hua and Chao (Hua had done a whole lotta lie down get up after coming to the shower dorm &amp; coming up hurt. I'd thought that up and down was to avoid our Torture Chao, which was actually the first tick in his favour that he wasn't Mush). I also dropped Terrenace to the bottom of the list of the first day when he didn't use dismantling the shower as an excuse to be dirty but he started climbing rapidly up it again by end of the day...</p><p>Chao I was wary of for wanting to be part of the Mush-hunt extraordinaire team of Eleesha-Chao right off the bat. I'm a hyper wary player and so it's not my style typically to work with <em>anyone</em> but Chun 'till they're proven human. When I printed the list it went to Chun exclusively and she decided the best thing to do with it was shred it lest we make a Mush feel like we're closing in and cause them to rampage. Before she shredded Janice managed to nab and read it too, which was funny since Chun had shared with me that Gio was suspicious of her. Ha!</p><p>Chao was on The List. And, leaving this burden all on Chun, so was I. The actual Mush on the list was Ian and he got the crosshairs on him by being one of 5 characters to go through a room where an extinguisher and wrench had been hidden (and, once again, 2 of the other people who also went through there were Chao and me along with yet another list member: Kuan Ti [the 5th was Chun. I decided Chun probably didn't hide the extinguisher. Ha!).</p><p>The fact that the Wrench was hidden and Terrence had never once wondered where the heck it was even though he was fixing and dismantling all over the place was the first thing that made him start climbing the Mushspects list again...</p><p>Chun was wary about killing Ian even though all my logs added up to "that guy be Mush!" and was inclined to have Chao torture him first to be sure we weren't killing an innocent. I was already sure we weren't and when it came up we had an handy opportunity to use shooter points on him at Day Change I pushed for that with Chun and Ian was all-Chao toast.</p><p>Interestingly, there was also an expo being planned at this moment and Chao had asked about his going on that first and get Ian after since he was around with Survivalist. Once again I felt this was him maybe trying to protect his Mush buddy and this is why I was also insistent that the right course is Chao Kill Now. Helpfully he got a migraine and the hunting tide turned...</p><p>I quickly became just a dead ass sure that the other Mush was Terrence. He was a great nemesis since he used my obsessive searching against me and at one point got me up to 2 spores in less than 24hrs! (This is the point where I then brought in Chun and Finola to rush the super soap!). He also nailed fellow pilot Hua with a spore.</p><p>In main chat there was still idle talk that our other mush was one of our idles but boy did some of us know different! However, we let that chat linger around to once again not tip off the Mush that we were after them with the serum.</p><p>Terrence was eventually boxed in with the demand he help finish a Nexus project with my relaying with him. He tried to sneak out of it but we were <em>very insistent</em> that he do that Right Now and no other duties and that left him in the perfect drained state for a Conversion.</p><p>With Terrence finally cured I could focus on my new nemesii: Stephen the User of Good Things and Gioele The Evil Billionaire (who, in the end, turned out to have a heart of gold risking life and limb on the last desperation expo for the final star map piece for The Good of His Fellow Man).</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Raluca was a tragic loss after a promising start but I'm very happy to say that barring (Roland, Stephan and Ian the Mush who only spoke <em>once</em> to say we should do the more pots project) I liked and appreciated everyone on this ship. Thank you very much for the experience!</p><p>This was my first MMM &amp; I'll be back just as soon as I get a sponsor to help me with better game-life balance myself through Gamers Anonymous. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

My faithful crew found me later but it was too late - MIA RNG decided it so that I was found dead.</p><p>I agree about there being many outstanding players on this ship... My personal favorites are maybe Elisha, Terrence and Chun (though every single one of them but some nasty inactives - Roland, Ian, Stephen - were great and noteworthy). <em>Eleesha</em> was just plain super active, helpful and friendly. Elaborative even. <em>Terrence</em> - well, we had quite a few of effective collaborations with him and he too was quite an earnest player. And <em>Chun</em>... Well, she believed me (or pretended to believe) from the start about not being a Mush when I tried to communicate with her about the Mush hunt. Which was very helpful since I am a habitual Much hunter... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I don't have much techiques and knowledge as to how to hunt effectively - but I have good enough instincts and observation/analysing capacity (or so I believe).</p><p>I had a bit of a rough voyage history with <em>Chao</em>... Not just me though, later I think Jin Su too. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> We started at neutral not talking with each other due to our roles being from different fields. Then, however, at some point Chao lost his cool and proclaimed me being his prime Mush suspect from then on... Because I talked too much about MycoAlarms locations in the open channel. I tried to explain to him in private that what I did is not necessarily a detriment but he wouldn't listen. Later though (many days later, but still) he came to me and apologised about his behaviour. I have to say, not many people with hot temperament have it in them to admit faults in their behaviour and to force themselves to apologise for it. So cheers to him for being one of those people. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink2.png" alt=":wink:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>And finally, it is too bad that you guys haven't managed to find that last Star Map piece... But whatever, i guess. 19 days and more than half a crew alive and returned to Sol is a great voyage result as is. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And the main boon of that voyage was the quality of the crew anyway.</p><p>Oh and <em>Gioele</em> constantly perving around <em>Finola</em> was funny... <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/surprise.gif" alt=":anim_surprised:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>P.S. <span class="tid_user tid_user_211583 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="211583">Tetsab</span>, I ended up passing both those super dangerous and important exams after all. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Now if only I would find myself a job and start working on my thesis.</p>
