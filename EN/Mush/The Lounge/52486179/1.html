This game we had Janice, and myself: Eleesha, as the Alpha Mush. It's really a shame how we lost, so very close. The main reason we lost really was because Janice took out two of our pilots, which absolutely destroyed us, and if we hadn't lost Raluca either to Quarantine, everything would have been fine. Would have made it. It's too bad, I really wanted to see your guy's reaction when you found out I was the Mush. Real, true shame... Maybe sometime soon!? Yes? Yes. Maybe.</p><p>Paola! You were probably my favorite person, you knew what you were doing, and how to do it, you were smart, and were like my second in command, had I been human. Good job on the Comms, though word of advice, use the notifications more next time around!</p><p>Terrence! My man! You were great, especially for a new guy, like, seriously! You'll be great at this game in no time. Just read the Mushpedia, update yourself, and, also, do your best next time around, to make sure you get some approval before doing stuff. You were going a tiny bit Rambo. Too bad we never got that couch built.... I would have shared it with you...</p><p>The rest of the crew, as much as I loved you all, I never really had anything too personal with you guys, aside from Janice! Who I loved, right away girl, you were along with my plan, and I'm glad you were hunky dorey with my plots, and scheming. Good job on getting those pilots! And a good thing Chun wasn't playing, ya? Come to think of it, Chun was probably a griefer, that's why she sat in the hallway... Should have reported it.. Hmm...</p><p>And I'm not saying the rest of you guys weren't nothing special, Derek, you were something unique, though if I wasn't Mush, I would have seriously thought it was you, communicate more man, talk to us, don't be a silent mute Derek like every other Derek out there.</p><p>The main issues with this ship is I guess inactivity, most people weren't on but like 30 minutes a day. I could never get plans, done, couldn't really direct anybody, because by the time they got on, what needed to be done had already done damage. Or wouldn't be effective.</p>
