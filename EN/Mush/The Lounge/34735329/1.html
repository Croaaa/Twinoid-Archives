                <p>Aw! A game named for <em>my</em> Paola! Thank you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. I was the untested, chatty, and very Teen Paola. Obviously her papa was first on the suspicious list, and our <em>dear, dear</em> Janice so gently gave the evidence that proved me right. Paola didn't act but called him out in private channels after an anxious night hugging her pillows. Tears at night and one thing lead to the next and, some days later, a dramatic explosion of AP waste in trying to kill him. Luckily I stuck to the RP and didn't stop when the killing was happening through Ian (at this point Paola was so upset that she'd spend her last energy before admitting defeat - there was a lot of emotion from her then). And luckily, Paola was not successful. Gioele admitted being depressed after killing an innocent crew member in an earlier cycle and he was treated accordingly. Human after all? Oh. I love you Dr Ian!! Realised there could be two reasons for this "mishap" (sorry again Gioele!) 1) Janice gave the wrong info or 2) There's something I don't understand about the game yet. Because Janice was doing so well on the "doing her job as per instruction" and was never seen dirty I hoped for 2 and expressed my willingness to leave her to cure her <em>if</em> she was indeed a mush. Finola on the other hand had done little research and said nothing, she was mush probably, but after having almost killed my dear papa, and oh so interesting (and important) rebels to chat to on the radio I had no AP to actually consider taking any action. Same with KT, no projects, hardly any talk. At this point I have to also admit I also had my eyes on You Captain, because I could not for my life see what you used your APs on. Finally, Gioele got out of his "stunned because I nearly died" and killed KT with the ship crew approval and he was mush, we assumed alpha mush. Chun was doing her best to push research forward. Raluca throughout had been working away on repairing the ship and Hua worked hard too but it was getting out of hand with Roland quarantined and JinSu picking shooter over pilot. I had to hack into the command to commandeer the ship once to save it from hunter destruction and only a short few cycles later I reported four cycles to asteroid impact. In retrospect I should maybe have tried to move fuel to the engine, and hacked into the ship to move it again when I returned 15 minutes before impact, the ship had been struck with sudden inactivity and we had almost the same number of hunters pounding on the ship as when I reported them in much earlier, ship was not in a great shape anylonger. And then we all died.</p><p>What I am most curious about is was there a lot of intrigue between mush? Did Finola plot openly? What would have happened if we had continued?</p><p>Janice, I forgive you, you're my girlfriend still!</p>

                <p>I still wanna hurt you for that RP. You're lucky I got to know you on a different ship and continue to love you despite the Paola. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And yes, I was Gioele. I wouldn't say I "rolled with" the RP so much as raged at it since it drove me up the wall IRL. But it really was pretty similar to how a cranky old father sick of his child's antics would react too. Inadvertent roleplay ftw?</p><p>Derpinator, who were you? We did have a good crew there... it's just too bad that we didn't get moved in time.</p><p>I was surprised as hell to find out that Kuan Ti wasn't one of the alphas. Eleesha's list really screwed him. He was the only one near the broken o2 tank (that never got announced) and when he showed up on the list, it was lights out for him. Janice had done such a good job keeping everyone's morale up that it was hard to believe that she could have been mush.</p><p>I knew for a fact that either Finola or Janice was mush. I had checked mycoscan and had 0 spores... was only ever in a room without a camera with Janice when fixing the o2 tank and Finola when trying to get a nexus project done. Shortly after that, I had a spore. I couldn't point for sure at one or the other and was having a real problem figuring either for a mush... or not a mush. I think the sooper sekrit private mush hunting channel was mostly settling on Finola just for lack of research... then the asteroids hit.</p><p>Overall, a great game. Let's do it again (but without the rp this time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> )</p>

                <p>Lol spacekadt, I won't be Paola for a long time at least (and maybe next time I'll be the timid, hardworking teen, scared of the radio!) - and I don't think I could pull off RPing Roland with all the pranks he's supposed to do which also could be annoying, maybe not as obnoxious! Hopefully next time the RPing doesn't drive you nuts!! Obviously, I also hope I don't kill you innocently, or almost kill you for that matter! I really don't know what the next character will be up to, it takes a few cycles for me to figure it out even when I have an idea from the start.</p><p>Ooh psibertus! Thank you!!

                <p>I have ideas for a more annoying female character (anyone know Delerium from Gaiman's Sandman?), and Chao I don't know if I dare playing him without an alternative to the character I have in mind. It's to pull it off and still be a useful/eventually trusted crew member that's hard. Paola was great because she has a counterpart in her dad and a clear role for working. Finola could use KuanTi I guess, but the rest have to write their own relationships onboard.</p><p>I was a terrible Raluca and if I had to be mush I was glad it was her because I totally "botched" her up, she was so grumpy I couldn't stand her. Let me say I wasn't subtle in my mush attack. Must come up with a different one before attempting the cat woman again.</p>
