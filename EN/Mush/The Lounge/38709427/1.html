                <p>What can I say? I don't think there's a better subject line for <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4211">our ship</a>. I'm sorry I lied to you all and made you suffocate to death, it was my duty for the sake of mush supremacy.</p><p>I had mixed feelings when I got that assignment. On one hand, FINALLY! I never get to be a mush!..on the other...Frieda? X_x Better than being a mush Paola I guess. I threw conversion out the window; there was no way Roland and I were going to be able to stay undercover converting people. So we made use of the inactives and worked humanly. All I'd have to do is sacrifice my glory once we reach 9-10 O2 by transferring into the conveniently inactive Stephen. I considered taking Terrence but not only did he come back; the My Account bug wouldn't have made that possible because I'm pretty sure I would have needed to level Terrence up to get Pilot. Thanks, MT.</p><p>Hilariously, the Paputa planet had O2, Hydrocarbons, Int Life, and other not-so-dangerous sectors. I felt a little bad for deleting it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> I considered sending you guys to Goulibia without O2 but with Roland's very sparse activity, I needed to try to take out the 9 O2 myself. To do that, I needed Stephen alive and I could sense that Derek or someone wasn't far off from killing him or trying to toss him into a storage room. Stephen was also reaching starvation so I didn't want to wait any longer. Thanks to that spore I pulled when I loaded fuel for you guys (Remember that? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico">), I was able to transpossess him no problem. AFTER taking 3 units on Frieda, of course. Unfortunately, here's where things went a little wrong...</p><p>I failed to sabotage the O2 Reservoirs. Thanks for nothing, <strong>Saboteur</strong>. I suppose that's just your way of spiting me for getting away without <strong>Splashproof</strong>, I guess. What I SHOULD have done was persist until I succeeded, but I only allocated 2-4 AP to sabotage on this bad plan. There was 10 O2, I could nullify 9..but what aboout that last 1? Why, with those convenient BP: Grenades, of course! I had another angle I wanted to approach: To kill Jin Su who had been frequently staying in Alpha Dorm. Lucky for him, he wasn't there this time. Without Jin Su, I would have been somewhat safer (Except I wasn't because of Andie and her Hacker's Kit). So I threw two grenades and shot up Derek, missing the kill shot. If Paola hadn't left me and I hadn't forgotten to sleep on the sofa, Frieda would have had enough AP to take the lab blaster which would have been enough to finish Derek. Getting Eleesha was just a bonus. I also derped by forgetting to Apprentice Pilot before leaving Alpha Dorm, another thing I had planned on Jin Su being around for. But would you look at that, Kuan Ti read that Pilot book without permission and was waiting right there for me to copy it! Thanks, Kuan Ti! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Well, having to move back and around and failing sabotage and etc., my plan was quickly falling apart. There was still 5 O2 left and when I built the grenade, it consumed the fuel unit on the floor in AB2 rather than the one in my inventory. NOT COOL. So when I went to retrieve O2 as Stephen, I had to think about whether or not I wanted 2 units or 1 + walkie. I was -dying- to see everyone's reaction to friendly helpful Frieda being an undercover alien menace. I also had..another idea. So I grabbed my walkie and launched with only one O2 unit. It was time for a last ditch plan.</p><p>Hello, Janice! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> Were you excited to see Stephen come back from inactivity to go on an unimaginative rampage in Alpha Dorm? I tried to think back to how he sounded with what few posts he made. I started typing 'u' instead of 'you' and thought 'Nah he wasn't that lazy.' Either way, I wanted everyone to think that it was him and that he went inactive because you guys rocked out on ASG and Constipaspore (Still don't know why Roland wasted 4 AP on a second spore..). The reason for that is because Frieda was carrying 3 O2 and if I could keep you guys from killing her, you wouldn't have 3 extra cycles to find air. NOT THAT THAT WAS A WELL THOUGHT OUT PLAN, given the screaming myco-alarm in the Refectory and Frieda having 0 skills left. It was late, so I went to bed disappointed: 5 days of pretending only to rush too soon without Roland's help and stupidly exploding grenades instead of just succeeded on the O2 sabotage.</p><p>But then I woke up the next morning and saw something delightful: Roland came back a cycle or two after my failure and set up the asphyxiation process! Jin Su seemed to be blaming Terrence which was hilarious and also momentarily blaming Andie. I'm dying to know what happened afterwards, aside from people suffocating to death <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So all in all, I had fun with you guys, I'm sorry that I couldn't have been on your side and had to lie and betray you all for almost a week. That does get tiring, even if the final moments are hilariously amusing. As humans, you did great being active and getting through that expo and important researches. Roland, it would have been nice to hear from you more, but you did your part and seriously made my day, so thank you.</p><p>I gave a like to Andie and give her the most credit for being a thorn in my side for <em>hiding that hacker's kit!</em> I was -so- worried that she was going to make me confide in her after I loaded fuel. Lucky break there, although I did examine everything in the engine room and was prepared to answer "Why do you have so many examines?!" with "I was stuck in the Engine Room for several cycles, I got bored. I'm rarely ever in here for long periods of time so I was curious to see what everything did." I even made sure I examined everything once, so it could work. I wanted so bad to send you guys to an 02 planet then leave you behind because Chun never picked it up. I would have gone so far as to transfer with Eleesha and use Observant to find it and IT Expert to say adios. Also gave Jin Su a like for being a good commander, I definitely enjoyed spending my human portion of the ship working with you guys. Feel free to post your own perspectives and suspicions on this ship! I'm sure -some- of you were on to me when I volunteered to load fuel <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Andie here, 2nd time since the update too so I'm still figuring things out (gotta get better at the mush hunt and what not) .I'll be honest ,I didn't have any hopes for that ship at all due to at least half of the ship being inactive or just plain stupid. Roland, ian , stephen , raluca, eleesha , gioele and chun really didn't do much.</p><p>I gotta say that's the last time I'll put limits on confide. Especially considering how terrible that ship went but I'm not sure what I was expecting to find out when there's only 3 spores and all the mushy actions were rushes.</p><p>The only thing I was proud of is being able to singlehandedly kill both mushes even if in an indirect manner. I got lucky when it came to the hacker kit, I succeeded on my first attempt. I also hid it in an obvious place too, right at the medlab where I was sleeping. It was always under my nose in case we needed it. It's second resting place was the garden but it wasn't required anymore.</p><p>I honestly didn't suspect you as being mush Frieda though some others did say you might be, though I thought it was just really bad RNG. Especially considering I had a ship where I took 19 points worth of damage during the first 3 days. This was while being a human mind you. If we had went with my plan to kill the inactives I could've probably gotten Roland earlier since it with highly likely that at least one of them was a mush.</p><p>As for the second mush, Roland. I kinda lied about being away since I thought i'd be away for a while but got back just in time to see Roland do his thing and then proceed to knife him at least half a dozen times before he jumped on a patroller. He then died next cycle due to bleeding out.</p><p>Lastly I believe that examining and item doesn't show up on confides , and neither does picking up/dropping them so that plan would have failed. If not you would have looked suspicious anyway.</p>
