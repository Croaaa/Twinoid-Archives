                <p>Well someone had to get this up here, leave it to Ol inflated gloryhound Roland to set things right. This was my first really active ship, and some of the most fun I've had in Mush so far.</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2242" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2242</a></p><p>Pressed for time so I'll just list the highlights.</p><p>-3 day mush hunt for two Active Alphas and so much paranoia.</p><p>We were thrown off early when drooling Chao woke up in Icarus Bay and mutated (we discovered later he had been mushed so an Alpha could go anonymush)- it turned out he would be a huge help after all as we began Mush researches right away <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Things were sketchy with a missing hacker kit and an antisocial-almost-completely-useless Eleesha... but we needed O2. Our saving grace was Janice spotting some suspicious looking mutual bathing/healing at Bravo dorm (between Terrence and our strangely unhelpful Jin). This was the final straw as far as Jin was concerned, so we took him down.. almost immediately after, we finished Pheromodom. This uncovered a dastardly plot to strand us on our Expo... along with Terrence the Mush's very distinctive speech patterns. Terrence you were the most helpful Mush ever, and without Phero and you finding the hacker kit where I had searched before, we would have never suspected you!</p><p>-The death march expo.</p><p>Ok, so maybe this was partially my fault. What do you want from me I didn't scan the planet, I just steer the metal birds! Anyways we landed on a planet and proceeded to take damage from almost every single square. Every Desert, every marsh.. everything wanted us dead. It was brutal and Paola even wrote her last will and testament... in the end we all made it back alive JUST BARELY. Hua had 1 health.</p><p>-Frieda turns into Organic Waste. No one was very surprised.</p><p>I kinda liked Frieda but she was a grumpy, constantly dirty, old bat. Paola did unspeakable things with her remains. She didn't need to eat another ration for 5 days <img src="../../../../gfx/square/puke.png" alt="°x°" class="tid_ico"></p><p>-Pleasure cruise</p><p>The rest of the trip was nice and laid back. We churned out research. We discovered the opposite of Death Planet and came back loaded with fruits and rations. We ate jumpkins. Gioele was our glorious leader and did a great job keeping us moving. On day 13 after our first real close encounter (with a bunch of asteroids) plus a ship falling apart/plasma shields at 0, and no starmaps- we decided to head back to Sol with the serum. Stephen committed morale suicide (Mars prisons must be rough) and we threw a final farewell party on the bridge.</p><p>I'm sure I've skipped over plenty, this was an awesome trip <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>PAOLA HERE! Oh man this ship...</p><p>Terrence, I thought you had been turned because you were so helpful around the ship! After you were killed, we weren't sure what we were going to do without a technician, but we luckily got a technician book from Xyloph. We also got a logistics expert book that Freida read, then she promptly exploded into a pile of guts in a cycle after. Just terrible luck there.</p><p>Jin Su, I'm not sure if it was the Mush in you or if its the typical Jerk Su player, but you came off pretty stand off-ish. I'm sorry but it had to be said.</p><p>That whole night where we Mush hunted and deliberated on what to do was insane.. I stayed up till 3AM that night, but it was so worth it. Gotta thank our Janice being so observant there.</p>

                <p>That was an intense Mush hunt for sure. Without Janice's damning observation, the chances of us tearing ourselves apart from paranoia would have been very high haha.</p><p>I feel a bit bad for rushing and not mentioning more crew also, everyone who made it to the end with us was great. A less jerky RNG would have brought us to Eden without a hitch!</p>
