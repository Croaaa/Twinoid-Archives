                <p>I was hoping someone else will do that, because my English skills are far from being perfect… But well, I would like to hear from some people I met on my previous ship, so here we go…</p><p><strong><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1876" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1876</a></strong> - One of the MMM ships which just ended not so long time ago. We could probably go for a few more days, but well… Let’s start from the beginning.</p><p>It was my second trip on Daedalus and my first time as a Terrence, so well… You can still call me a newbie. Good there were people who were good in giving advices.</p><p>Anyway… The ship was filling rather fast (For obvious reason) and the game started. Finola was the main character on those first days, saying what to do and rushing with researches in Laboratory like crazy. In no time we had every important stuff ready – which made a really hard time for the Mushes. We had four pilots on board, so we didn’t had to worry about the space – after all we could shoot down everything! All those scraps for my precious drones, can you imagine? My kids growing and being better each day! Oh right… I wasn’t supposed to focus on that thing. Everything was going smoothly: researches, projects, we didn’t missed even a single rebel base thanks to Paola who wasn’t very talkative but she was doing her job – that’s what is important, right? But there still was a threat on the ship – two mushes hiding and waiting for the right time.</p><p>A few people started talking about hunting those two down. But guessing who they might be was a really thought questions – they didn’t had much space to do anything bad, so we were moving blindly questioning every suspicious move of the rest of the crew.</p><p>While in the same time we were doing what we had to do for survival. We prepared our first expedition – but it was really hard to gather everyone we needed in Icarus Bay. Three people were already there, so we needed only Jin Su (Commander and Pilot)… Unfortunately he wasn’t available at this point, but we didn’t want to leave commander on board of the Daedalus. Hua had a better idea, rushed into the Icarus Bay and took the rest to the planet’s surface. You can just imagine what the rest of the crew thought about it.</p><p>We were lucky… This time. Expedition went well, we were able to gather some resources. The only problem we had at this point was to how communicate with Hua, she really wanted to do stuff on her own.</p><p>It was around Day 4 or maybe 5 (I don’t remember) when everything changed. I woke up and went to the bridge. Everything there was broken because of some kind of accident. I had a lot of work waiting for me – but all that went really great. I was lucky I guess. A lot of people were on the bridge: Jin Su, Frieda, Paola and someone else… I don’t even remember. I left the bridge to repair something else in the MedLab… And after some time I noticed my morale just went down. And again. What the hell? What was going on? That’s when I noticed Neron announcement: Two people are dead. Hua and Eleesha were killed during their sleep. I had no idea what was going on, Finola were asking the same question screaming about Mush going berserk. Quick look on the map… someone was missing from the bridge and was just moving from the Bravo Dorm to the Rear Corridor… and later to Alpha Dorm were more people were resting. We discovered that Jin Su, our commander who was giving us speech before saying how we need to work for him and for the whole ship was one of the traitor. But before we could do anything… Janice was dead as well. How? Does Jin Su could really do all the thing just by himself? Not at all, Roland who was sleeping in the Alpha Dorm was his partner and they both wanted to take as much humans as possible before they pathetic lives were taken. <br>Finola and I weren’t able to finish the job. Not a big surprise, right? Man on the wheelchair and Biologist. Fortunately for us Raluca left her safe house in the Engine Room and helped us – she even took one of the Mush herself. At the end Chao ended the existence of the other one.</p><p>So yeah… We were safe. Mushes are gone… but we had to pay price for that. Three people were dead. From that moment we had to pay close attention to our morale: no more speeches, no more shrinky talk. We were on our own. Also from four pilot and masters of the skies we were left with only one pilot – a guy who can’t even walk. From that moment I had too much to do: upgrading drones, repairing stuff, killing hunters, collecting scraps – it wouldn’t be possible without a few missions from Chao (Our new commander). When everything was starting to look optimistic we were hit by another bad news – Finola died from depression. How? No one actually see that coming.</p><p>But we had to keep moving. Raluca was repairing Pilgred and saying how much she hate us all (I know she loved us deep in her hearth), Chao took position of a leader and his speech at the beginning of everyday was really motivating, Frieda tried to search for some good planets (We were hoping for starmaps – why don’t to try to reach Eden?) but without much luck, Ian was doing amazing job with keeping plants in a good shape, Chun was doing her job in the lab working for two, Paola on the bridge communicating with rebels, Kuan Ti busy with projects and saying how amazing the whole ship is and how much he loves that piece of crap and Stephen doing I guess… almost everything (From emptying all of the turrets to repairing broken oxygen and fuel tanks). And me? I was killing hunters with the help of my amazing drones (And with a help of Stephen of course. He preferred to stay in turrets instead of a kitchen. Weird cook, really). In the meanwhile Gioele died from starvation (Did no one told him he need to eat to survive?) and we were preparing for a few more expedition.</p><p>Of course our bad luck didn’t left us. On one of the expo we lost Frieda, so we were ready to do another trip just after the first one will finish. Paola almost died, Chun wasn’t in a good shape either… and just when we return to Daedalus a sheet metal fall on Chun, killing her. Just like that. On one moment she was standing there, on the second… her body was laying on the floor under a piece of that damn ship! But we had a job to do so we returned on the planet to find Frieda and guess what happened? Chao get lost, so now we had two people missing. Fortunately for us both of them were able to find their way and we get back on the Daedalus with everyone.</p><p>But the problem was still there. Without Jin Su, without Janice and now without Chun… We gonna die from depression sooner or later. This wasn’t looking very good. We were ready to get back to Sol already (Pilgread finished, Mushes are dead, Serum ready), but the crew still wanted to try to reach Eden. Everyone was doing their best keeping the rest of the crew healthy and in a good condition. But still it wasn’t enough: Paola died. There was seven of us left, we were doing quite fine. But still we couldn’t find the planet we were looking for (Even if we had three astrophysicist). On previous expo we gathered a lot of fuel and oxygen, so that wasn’t a problem. We just needed those starmaps! <br>At the end… We returned to Sol. Chao didn’t want to risk any more lives. We probably could be fine for a couple of more days, but… who knows if someone wouldn’t paid the biggest price for trying. I’m sure we could reach Eden – with a little bit more luck. We wasn’t afraid of mushes or hunters at the end – the biggest treat was Daedalus itself!</p><p>Anyway… Like I said it was my second trip and it was marvelous and amazing! Thank you all for the time we spend together!</p><p><strong>Finola</strong> – It was a great start. Too bad you died so early. <br><strong>Chao</strong> – Thanks for all the advices you gave me and for every single speech that made me work even harder. <br><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> – don’t even try to design anything more. I knew that ship will try to kill us all. <br><strong>Raluca</strong> – I hope you know I still hate you for all your comments <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Abusing poor old man on the wheelchair. <br><strong>Ian, Frieda, Stephan, Chun</strong> – It was a great pleasure to play with you all.</p><p>And about the mushes… <strong>Jin Su</strong> and <strong>Roland</strong>. I know it was hard to be on the other side in active ship, but still what you did made day 4 very dramatic and I don’t remember when was the last time I felt so much things in the same moment while playing a game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Hope to see you guys again! And sorry for such a long text, I hope it’s not so bad.</p>

                <p>Thanks very much for the writeup. Chao the reluctant commander here. I have to admit I was not very interested in being either Chao or commander, first time for both of those. I took Chao because I was worried I would miss the MMM, and once Jin Su was dead I had no choice but to step into his role. It is not in my nature at all to boss people around (though I will happily give my opinion whether others want it or not) so it was a learning experience for me. A few random thoughts / observations:</p><p>- This was *by far* the most active ship I have been on. The first couple of days I found it tough to keep up with everything that was going on. Things settled down a little bit later (after the mush were dead) as people got into a good flow with well defined roles.</p><p>- I did not envy the mush's job on this ship. Finola appeared and was a research and organization monster. We had so much anti-mush stuff in place by the end of Day 1, and by Day 2 it was just about impossible for them to do anything. We had the gas, mycoalarms, constipaspore, access to Bravo Dorm (only shower) was controlled, and everyone's activity was being closely watched.</p><p>- Jin Su and Roland came up with a decent plan: let everyone assemble in Icarus Bay and wait for Jin Su, then Roland jumps in and flies the expo and Jin Su moves the ship. Three humans dead instantly. I assume Jin Su would then try to kill as many more as possible. This would have worked if Hua hadn't ignored all of the discussion of personnel and charged in to fly the expo. Ironically, we gave her hell for that not knowing it saved our lives. Jin Su had gone offline to wait for Roland to make his move (I guess they had a schedule) and he didn't get back in time to abandon us.</p><p>- My guess is the mush panicked when Finola started talking about clearing as many humans as possible with the food test, which she wanted to do around the start of Day 4 when everyone had to eat anyway. So late Day 3 they went on their rampage. I don't know how close they got to killing Chun as well. It looks like she was hit a few times but got away. Finola got gastroentiritis from watching people die and got dirty. I punched/cured her, but she did not get back online to shower for a few cycles. She just couldn't stand being dirty so she killed herself.</p><p>- This would have been a very different ship if Finola hadn't died on Day 4. She was always on top of the details and was driving us hard. She had good, loud opinions on every aspect of the ship. I am sure she would have acted as leader if she had lived.</p><p>- On my previous ships one of the biggest make-or-break things was having a very active, communicative, and decisive commander. So although I was uncomfortable assuming command I decided I would strive to be these three things, and also to be firm and project as much strength as possible. I don't know why I started doing that daily speech and priority list, and I couldn't tell if people liked or hated it, but once I started I just decided to stick with it.</p><p>- It was nice never to have to worry about finding a bed, but Chao's struggle with AP is absolutely maddening.</p><p>- I know I brought us home early. I understand that there are lots of ships full of griefers and inactives and that everyone was having a good time playing with such a fun crew. I weighed that against the desire to let all of us share in the win. It would have been such a shame to lose Stephen and then still have to go home a few cycles later. I'm still not sure I made the right call, but I would have done that for any of the remaining crew.</p><br><p>Some notes on the other players:</p><p>Paola was an incredibly efficient Comms officer. She blazed through Xyloph and got the rebel bases within a cycle or two like clockwork. However she was not responsive at all on chat (public or private) and didn't seem to know what to do when Comms was finished. She also never reported her status and while we tried to heal her as much as we could in the later days, she never responded to flirtation. Unfortunately her death by suicide was all too predictable.</p><p>Chun was a great crewmate who drove the remaining research after Finola was gone, and then made it her mission to keep everyone healthy. She got back from an expo with 5 HP right before cycle change, and got steel plated before we could do anything. Losing her was really not fun.</p><p>KT did awesome pushing all of the NERON upgrades and then becoming our second dedicated scanner, and he was a pretty hilarious crab-man for the rest of the voyage after watching Jin Su bite the dust. Always dropping to the floor screaming for his mother at the worst times...</p><p>Stephen was a blur running around doing the thankless stuff. He fixed things all around the ship, kept our combustion chamber loaded, and helped a lot with aracks from the turrets. I don't know what was going on but both he and I were using ncc contacts, and he seemed to hit a lot more of those things than I ever could.</p><p>Frieda just had terrible luck with planets. I really looked forward to and counted on her input, though. She didn't weigh in on stuff too often but when she did we all followed her advice.</p><p>Raluca, what can I say? Finished PILGRED, geniused the serum, pushed us through on the Plasma Shields, constantly fixing stuff with her bare hands. She was amazing at everything except the Astro Terminal.</p><p>Ian brought us two extra hydropots and did a great job with his bananas. I didn't realize until this voyage what a huge task it is to keep 7 plants healthy. We wouldn't have lasted nearly as long without him. I wish we'd gotten him a chance to try some alien fruit experiments.</p><p>And Terrence.... our superstar and a very funny guy on top of it. Chasing hunters, collecting scrap, repairing things, upgrading three drones (man, those things kick ass when you have turbo/pilot/magnetic net) and even making some time to keep his comrades healthy. There was nothing this old man couldn't do.</p><br><p>A really great crew and it was a pleasure to go on that journey with you. Good luck to all in your future voyages.</p>

                <p>Hello all, it is Jin Su.</p><p>First I want to thank Terrence for his kind words in the honours list and in this write-up. It was really stressful to be a Mush on this ship (although I now see how easy and fun it could be on a non-organized ship!), but I gave it my best effort anyway. It is like the game Mafia (or Werewolf on the site I play) - doing your best as a bad guy is what makes the game fun for the good guys! It is your <strong>responsibility</strong> to play your best even if you would rather be on the other team! After the game when someone like Terrence thanks you for making it exciting, you are reminded of this.</p><p>I logged off during our Expedition Trap because I thought someone might open a private communication channel with me, just to see my online status. If it showed me "Online" when the chat opened, the jig would be up. I know that feature is buggy (and maybe not reliable at all?) but it struck me that since pretending to be AFK is a legitimate Mush tactic, that showing a person's online status in those private channels might be a bad feature.</p><p>Ultimately we got nearly as many kills with our rampage as we would've with the Expedition Trap. I was really worried that I would be Mush on one of the first ships to get to Eden, and I really didn't want that reputation. So killing three people in a rampage exceeded our expectations. Having Finola die of depression afterwards was an unexpected cherry on top. Finola was a tremendous leader. I haven't wanted to play a non-MMM ship since I died, because it will be so unorganized compared to this ship. I'm glad to have played a part in this ship even if at the time I said to Roland, "I don't have the energy to do this any longer, I am just going to rampage."</p><p>Another thing I learned is not use your AP until the ship fills and you know your role. On a random ship I can see getting a fast start, setting the tone as a leader, etc., but on an MMM ship it's better to wait and see if you're a Mush before you go giving speeches to eight people and relaying Antispore Gas. Doh!</p>

                <p>Jin Su, I feel for you. You and Roland were in a really tough spot on this ship. You managed to do quite a bit of damage by leaving us with no Janice or Jin Su and only one pilot. I don't know what we would have done if you got Chun and/or Terrence as well.</p><p>I think the abandon first, rampage later, plan was pretty good. I wonder if you could have waited and tried again on the next expo? Hua was sufficiently chastised, she wouldn't have flown another surprise mission. You could have had Roland load fuel, toss the grenade in a dorm, then take off. You move the ship and then kill as many as of the injured as you can.</p><p>And I agree about the chat thing. It does seem pretty bugged, but as a mush you really should be able to lurk and watch while pretending you're not online. If it worked reliably, it would hinder mushes doing that.</p>

                <p>I'm not sure you guys would've gone into Icarus Bay en masse before me again. More than half the ship had already been cleared as lock humans, and a few others had cleared themselves on tone/activity. I'm sure that Roland and I were both on everyone's Top 5 (if not Top 3) suspect lists. And that was before Eleesha printed her list. At least one of us would've been on there with 2-3 super likely humans.</p>

                <p>Frieda here. Enjoyed the ship a lot. There were ups and downs, bad lucks, mush rampage, annoying players - a bit of everything. Which is what made the ship eventful.</p><p>Just want to point out that we had amazingly bad luck in all our expeditions. Out of 26 planets scanned, no even one zone was Cristallite. For the first 4-5 expeditions, we never had a single positive event. It was all either combat, wandering events, injury etc. Even zones like Intelligent Life (with Babel Module), Ruminants gave us negative events all the time! Even got lost twice in a single planet. By then end, I was tired and was fine with Chao's decision to return to Sol</p><p>Also, I saw the power of drones ! Three drones upgraded to turbo, fireman and pilot. They killed hunters like butter. Of course, opst day 10 we would still need a pilot but till D10, drones + plasma shield + magnetic net is awesome for any hunter, asteroid, trax etc</p><p>Liked:<br>1. Chun and Finola's research. By D2C6, we had antispore, contispaspore, mycoalarms done. The mush had no chance to infect. We had completed all research by Day 10.<br>2. Chao's leadership after the mush rampage and death of people. Chao was instrumental in taking the ship beyond Day 10. Motivating us, planning etc<br>3. Ian's generosity. Ian was quite generous with his vending machine stuff. The project and coffee and all. He also got screwed by a cow<br>4. Terrence and Raluca's fun. And Kuan Ti too for his "crabbiness" There were absolutely hilarious in chats and enjoyed the banter. <br>5. Stephen's all round activity. There was nothing eh didnt do. Put out fires, repaired, killed hunters. Perfect jack-of-all-trades</p><p>Dislike:<br>1. Hua. He was an annoying player. Never co-ordinated and was belligerent. Hijacked an expedition. Distracted us from real mush. Didn't miss him when he died<br>2. Paola's non-communication. While she did a job as Comms, she never responded to anything. Also hijacked an expedition which got Chun and almost lost me and Chao. She went inactive after her comms stuff was done when Paola is actually very important player post her comms - especially to put out fires, heal, general help around the ship. Which she failed to do.</p><p>I had no problems with the mush Jin Su and Roland. They did what they had to do. We all expected the mush to attack but not so early. Should have been more careful with weapons. Also, Jin Su, you got the wrong people... we were fine with Hua and Eleesha dead. Janice was a good kill but we managed morale through banana + sex everyday (Heat Lamps are awesome too !). Until later when Stephen had 3 panic attacks in 2 days, we didnt have a problem. Finola's bonus death was also bad for ship. She was active and was about to take Astro. But, if you had substituted Hua and Eleesha with anyone else, the ship would hav gone down faster.</p><p>P.S Jin Su and Roland, You were NOT on the top our list <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. I suspected Jin Su because I caught his AP mismatch but others didn't take it further. Ironically, Hua and ELeesha were on the top of our list, lol.</p>

                <p>Oh, awesome, this ship did get a thread! Stephen here, kinda late to the party. This ship was absolutely amazing. It was my first time as Stephen, but I think it was down to him and Chao and ... well, my personality does not suit Chao. My schedule also doesn't allow for effective Mush hunting, so I picked what I thought would be best for everyone.</p><p>In the beginning, I didn't really know what to do with myself. Bravo Dorm was on lock-down, there were more important people in Alpha Dorm beds, so I .... just kind of stood around in the Laboratory and relayed with Finola. I was basically her lackey in the beginning, there. She'd always be on right before I headed to work, so we were able to bounce back and forth on research. My assists were pretty lame, compared to the research powerhouse that she was, and it was awesome to watch her plow through her experiments so. Amazingly. Quickly.</p><p>I'm one of those that doesn't have flash on their phone and can't be arsed to figure it out, so I was only able to read the chat at work. When I had the chance to check the chat and saw that all kinds of stuff had gone on with the Mush being revealed, I was like, "Woaaah, what happened?" Keeping up with reading everything that was going on took the majority of my lunch breaks. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>At that point, though, we were basically free to sink or ... uh, drift through space, I guess. Pretty lucky that there was a tech book for me, gave a real edge for patching up the ship, once it started shaking apart on us. No one seemed to be using the scooter, so I was using it pretty much exclusively. I almost felt like just holding onto it and one of those lenses, since it felt like I was always running to whatever broke, then scooting off to the various turrets to snipe some hunters. It was especially lucky that those blasted O2 tanks only seemed to self destruct when I was actually around to fix them, there at the end.</p><p>It was the panic attacks that almost did me in, though. Got really unlucky in the final days with those. I'm gonna say it was the shock of losing Finola after working so closely in her lab at the beginning. Thanks again for chosing to bring us home, Chao, it was nice to get my feet on solid ground. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>
