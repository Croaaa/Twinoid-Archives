                <p>So if anyone actually remembers me in any ships they will usually always remember me for two things:</p><p>1.) I can be a bit of a asshat. As I'm told much in life, I lack tact. I tend to just get to point or the root of an issue in the most direct manner, and often it can be interrupted (mostly rightly so) as me being a jerk.</p><p>2.) I always get things done. The more astute will quickly see that I can always be relied on, whether its doing my job or someone else's.</p><p>I was on the MMM ship that lasted to day 30, and you can ask anyone there that I was most likely not the most pleasant person to engage in conversation with, but I was just as valuable as any other happy go lucky member since I knew how to do my part to keep the ship going.</p><p>Basically what I'm saying is that everywhere you go in life, you will have to work with people you may not like. That's ok. You don't have to like them, but they do do their job, and you have to learn to do yours along side theirs. If you don't have strong evidence against someone, think about before taking them out just because you don't get along. The crew may really need the skill they're providing, and you just screwed everyone else b/c you didn't like someone. I'm bad with words at times, but I guess that the gist of my point: MUSH is social game. <em><strong>Learn to adapt and operate in ANY social environment in life and you'll go far.</strong></em></p>

                <p>Well, frankly, my nature is that I hate jerks. So telling me to adapt to jerks by jerk who themself won't adapt to not being the jerk although they know they are jerk, seems like a hypocrisy and alibism to me.<br>On the other hand, I'm kinda jerk myself, especially to those hypereffective but absolutely untactful jerks, who think that their effectivity makes them always right. I just don't like and don't work well with authorities who I don't find respectable and I just can't respect someone who is outright rude. So, Coraxes, please learn to adapt to me not going to cooperate well, if we meet some time in the future on ship. It's just a part of social game. Cheers! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But to the point: Killing people just because you don't like their attitude in this kind of game is outright stupid. If someone is doing this, don't hesitate and report them. They are probably playing against their team unless they had any evidence.</p>

                <p>I actually like when people don't get along perfectly. Compromising is the best way to do what is right for everyone in the long run, so having two strong personalities who occasionally butt heads is a good thing, as long as they don't polarize the ship into an all-out war (see: my complaints on politics, but we won't go there).</p><p>Two things I should point out, though:</p><p>Being a jerk TO be a jerk is not very nice. If it's not intended to hurt, I can work with you even if I don't like it. But if somebody is being a douchecanoe just because they can, it tends to gum up the works. Just try your best, and that's all I can ask.</p><p>Not liking somebody in your game is <em>never</em> a reason to kill them. You may hate each other's guts, but if one of you is Janice and the other is Chun, congrats! You've just crippled your ship. There's always a way to work it out, even if it's just actively ignoring each other. Enough people are going to die on this trip at the hands of the Mush or the RNG, so don't add to the problems you have already.</p>

Human nature is a very tough thing to change, but it's entirely possible. You meed a large variety of people in the world, and whether they're good or bad (or pure evil) you have to accept them for who they are, and how they live their life. Coraxes, it might have been tough (or not at all) to write this, and I must commend you on your efforts. I do agree with npfan though, being nice can pay off sometimes (sexually). <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></cite><p>Eh, it was hard to find the words of what I'm trying to say. Much of what you say is true. It is hard to change how people are. That is what I was cautioning against. You can single me out here because I posted, but we all know there are a lot more people with similar play styles. <br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1820396 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1820396">Patches1984</span></span><cite>On the other hand, I'm kinda jerk myself, especially to those hypereffective but absolutely untactful jerks, who think that their effectivity makes them always right. I just don't like and don't work well with authorities who I don't find respectable and I just can't respect someone who is outright rude. So, Coraxes, please learn to adapt to me not going to cooperate well, if we meet some time in the future on ship. It's just a part of social game. Cheers! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></cite></p><p>No I agree completely Patches. Most of the time you have to earn my wrath, but I have snapped off at say someone running off with the apron, or some other irritating action. In which case you would go at me and the tit for tat would begin. And I'm totally down for having to work out a way to compromise with you and see how far we can make it. <br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8281354 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8281354">Isidarth</span></span><cite><br>I actually like when people don't get along perfectly. Compromising is the best way to do what is right for everyone in the long run, so having two strong personalities who occasionally butt heads is a good thing, as long as they don't polarize the ship into an all-out war (see: my complaints on politics, but we won't go there).<br><br>Two things I should point out, though:<br><br>Being a jerk TO be a jerk is not very nice. If it's not intended to hurt, I can work with you even if I don't like it. But if somebody is being a douchecanoe just because they can, it tends to gum up the works. Just try your best, and that's all I can ask.<br><br>Not liking somebody in your game is <em>never</em> a reason to kill them. You may hate each other's guts, but if one of you is Janice and the other is Chun, congrats! You've just crippled your ship. There's always a way to work it out, even if it's just actively ignoring each other. Enough people are going to die on this trip at the hands of the Mush or the RNG, so don't add to the problems you have already.</cite></p><p>I like this and sums up many much of what I'm trying to say. Don't misinterpret what I'm saying here. This isn't about outright griefers or those who are complete douchebags who are, as you said, acting that way because they can. Its about those who don't necessarily socialize the way you might. <br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_7804052 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7804052">DanielMercury</span></span><cite>People are suppose to have fun, not to win or die in flames! You can make a ship go to day 60 and Eden, but if at the end everyone is glad to be off the ship because they wanted just to close the tab and forget about the crew, then you have failed to get the main point of a GAME!</cite><br>I don't ever act in a manner that makes the whole crew miserable and just eager to get rid of me. Like I said I was on a 30 day ship and everyone there would do fly it again again with me. Believe I was referred to as the sassy mouthed Eleehsa. Now there are those that would seek to achieve those goals, and if I happened to end up being around one I would still end up working around them. As long as their doing their job. Of course I'd also end up tearing into them as well.</p>

It's sanctionable kill someone purely because one finds them disagreeable <em>but</em> it's difficult for human beings to be completely objective. For people who are already suspects, jerks will likely get the knife before the charmers. This is a fact. Even worse, actual mush playing a long game will have an easier time disposing of you.</p><p>Convincing people to do what you want is part of the game. Linguistical finesse will help you sell your opinions to the crew, be it opinions on mush suspects, security or post-hunt survival. Even if you're a tactical guru, it's not going to matter if someone else, mush or human, convince the crew otherwise.</p><p>Mind you, I personally don't have a problem with difficult people in my games.

If you don't care that they react poorly, then why bother making this thread?</p><p>There are far more people out there you are trying to change to not react poorly to you, then the sole person that you are.</p><p>Your point is valid, but you seem to fail to apply it to yourself.</p><p>As for me personally, I don't report people for being annoying.

Maybe they actually <em>are</em> socially impaired. Maybe they're having a tough time in their life right now.

You don't have to like it, but you're stuck with them. If the only way you can deal with it is to think of the good of the ship, you are trying. And sometimes that's all we can ask. c:</p>

                <p>I can relay a story that relates to what Goldenthumbs talked about. A few ships back we had a super-active Stephen who was constantly offering bad advice and voting for harmful things. He wasn't 100% as bad as possible - he wasn't recommending suicide or anything like that, instead he was consistently advocating the less efficent and effective choices, be they for projects choices, for which planet to visit, if planets were worth more scans or not, if pilots should eat or not, or launch or not, to deal with a specific number of hunters when they had low AP, what research needed to be done, if resets should be done on X or if something else was more important...</p><p>He was also extremely negative. Not constantly personally negative, not directly insultive, at least not to players who were still active; no he went weirdly verbally abusive towards the inactives, went off about about the ship's horridly low chances of success and survival and was extremely negative about how little fun this game was to play and how extremely boring it was.</p><p>A few sample comments from him:</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">I don't know what's wrong with you people, are you all stock brokers or hedge fund managers? It's a goddamn game, just do it, don't think of the worst possible outcome like something that's bound to happen!<br><br>Plus we could use some action, this ship is boring as hell.<br><br>I seriously doubt anything is working as intended. A game that "forces" players to play a certain way, roleplay that is, yet excludes those same players from the judging process and instead relies on an external body to check reports is just broken and stupid. What does it matter to you if someone gets reported after he/she already fucked up your game? Little. Not to mention that there is no way that an external body can just read a few logs and understand the situation enough for a fair judgment, a lot of shit will go unnoticed.</span></span></p><br><p>A sample discussion between him and I:</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Jin Su: We have just over 2 days of air left. We're about to have everything else put on hold until an O2 planet is found.<br><br> Stephen: Well then, make that your focus, you have nothing else to to besides that and Neron.<br><br> Jin Su: Stephen, think strategy. Do I have a bed? How fast do I gain AP? Do you think the odds are so high of finding O2 that one player is likely to find it on their first try? We actually need people, one after the other, searching until we do indeed find O2.<br><br> Stephen: There are 10 active people and 8 beds, i call that plenty enough. Don't worry, you have 2.5 days, you'll find plenty of planets.<br><br> Stephen: You can sleep on the bridge and let Paola get your +1, you can get a planet between just the two of you, and you're not alone.<br><br> Stephen: I mean dont let me play a smartass, im sure you have as much experience as i, possibly a lot more, just stop overthinking it, if you want to have a plan b for every possible outcome we really shouldnt be playing this game.<br><br> Jin Su: Stephen, I've not yet told you to stop playing the way you please. Please do not again tell me to stop playing the way I please.<br><br> Stephen: Like i said, im not, but just chill out a bit, it's like you want to be prepared for the worst possible outcome all the time, we have active people, we can do just fine, lets have some fun.<br><br> Jin Su: Stephen, I am. Furthermore, debate's good for the ships, it leads us to pick the best courses of action. And yes, by telling me to 'chill out', and especially 'just stop overthinking it, if you want to have a plan b for every possible outcome we really shouldnt be playing this game.' - you are telling me how to play, and telling me I don't even belong in the game. Bleeping rude, and I'll thank you to accept my playstyle as I accept yours.</span></p><p>Another sample:</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Stephen: Well do as you please, ill give it another day more and im gone. This ship has been a bore from start, there was literally no Mush hunt as all they did was go on rampage and we retaliated, after we killed them we did nothing at all except camp one location. I do not mind your way of playing, you play it safe for whatever reasons, but for me its boring, if i didnt have a lot of typing work to do i wouldnt even bother logging in. Ill keep making coffee and check any messages for a few cycles more, let me know if you need me something to do.<br><br>Jin Su: Stephen, do you care about the game rules at all?<br><br>Stephen: I havent even read them, so im indifferent. Tomorrow i finish maybe, Saturday at the latest, someone else will need to camp the Refractory, ill be logging in once daily to spend AP, around D8.<br><br>Stephen: It is pretty boring, we arent actually doing anything. I guess i can wait a few more cycles to see how those scans go before going beserk...</span></p><br><br><br><p>After the 'joy' of interacting with him for about a week, I contacted a mod and asked if I could discuss if his behavior was reportable - after all, as I read the rules, he's not actually breaking any - but he was singlehandedly making this ship almost unfun, not just for myself but for the majority of the actives upon it. The mod told me -yes-. this is reportable. This is "Passive Negativity", it is truly affecting the morale of the ship.</p><p>Furthermore, the mod told me they were surprised that the rest of the crew including myself hadn't killed him yet. I answered that though his attitude was horrible, his actually in play actions were acceptable, we outvoted his bad suggestions and he accepted the majority decision, and he was -doing- acceptable play, it was purely the attitude. Him alive was mechanically useful for the ship, at least as long as we kept not doing what he recommended.</p><p>So, Goldenthumbs and others in your situation, <em>rethink what you can do about similar situations</em>.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_5014892 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="5014892">Goldenthumbs</span></span><cite><p>Yes i run into this attitude often, a player thinks because they are experienced and knowledgeable, that gives them the right to verbally abuse everyone on the ship.</p><p>Cant kill em, because that's against the rules.

                <p>Check a post up, mate. If somebody is merely annoying, but is working for the good of the ship, then you'll have to just deal with it. There are ways to work things out, even if it comes down to just ignoring any of their posts unless other crewmates are discussing it.</p><p>Somebody being consistently abusive and harming the ship (yes, telling people to support the wrong things can be harmful if you have new players and they keep doing it despite another option being recognized as the better choice) is absolutely against the spirit of the game, even if they do not clearly break a written rule. And unless you are being overly sensitive, being harassed like this is absolutely an example of ruining the game for others (if you're worried, ask other players in PMs if you are overreacting).</p><p>Don't add to the trouble by doing something that is CLEARLY sanctionable. Two wrongs won't make a right, and you cheating your ship out of your character's skills when you knew it was possible that you wouldn't get along with everybody who could possibly join the game is arguably worse than somebody who is a little harsh but does their job and does it well.</p><p>((PS, some of those arguments from the examples above sound VERY familiar, and if they are the person I think they are, they have been sanctioned for such behavior in the past, admitted to it on the forums, but refused to accept the notion that they actually did anything wrong because the game allows it to be done.))</p>

I may or may not be on your ship this very second, but some people are. Build the team you want to play with.</p><p>My early play here, I ran into multiple griefers. Primarily of the 'kill random people' sort, with some variety of other griefing types added in... turns out a few of my early ships I happened to be playing with the same griefers over and over again.... guess that can happen when you start a new ship as soon as you die or get to Sol/Eden.... your shipmates may also be immediately looking for a new ship, so a much higher chance that you'll play beside at least some of the same people again. By the time I was on my 9th ship, I'd reported at least 1 player a game for blatant griefing behavior in 7 out of those 9 ships, and I'd reported 2 or more on like 5 of them.... one unlucky ship had 4 griefers.</p><p>I'd gone gold on my second ship, and I was starting to get a bit unamused. I chatted on the forums, and a mod started talking to me. Tried to reassure me that most players on most ships do not see a griefer every game. I was a touch skeptical, but accepted. However, having now played on.... (counts) ooh, 31 ships, I can say that I haven't quite seen a griefer on half of them. And all of my ships are random ships, I don't schedule with people for 'Sunday is Mushday' or MMM jumps.... though I also don't avoid them, so I sometimes random into that sort of ship.</p><p>By about game 5, I started making a PM early, usually before the ship was full, and into it I invited people who seemed clearly not griefers. Newbies who talked and tried to learn got invited, so did teh people who organized ship threads or just used them properly, people who communicated and seemed sane... I started building a 'community' of people who seemed clearly not griefers early on, even before mush selection. I'd say in it what the thread was, mention my frequent troubles with playing beside griefers, and tell people if they wanted to mushhunt elsewhere, that's fine.... but you're the people I'll trust if someone starts to try and ruin this ship early - and I won't wait to find out if they're mush or not before I come for help to stop them.</p><p>That PM has -always- gone well for me. Most people who are not griefers who play this game accept and enjoy teamwork. They may be leaders or followers, but most appear glad to work together. It's emotional support as well as mechanical help, it's often a foundation for a mushhunting thread (even though Chun isn't always invited in, especially at first.... Chuns can be griefers too) which is sometimes especially thrilling when one of the members becomes a mush (It's just one PM.... you still have 2 others. If you think one of your non-griefers is mush, deal with it as secretly as you would normally, there's nothing stopping you!).</p><p>You can discuss a verbally abusive player there and get a 'good player' consensus on what to do about that, from:</p><p>having 5+ people telling him to knock it off,</p><p>to you yourself saying, "K bub, you're reported for the trash you've been talking. The judges and mods <em>will</em> be reading the rest of the ship logs too, not just what's already happened. You control how badly you're getting punished, so think about what you say. I promise you, I'm going to be posting and making it clear how offensive your offending words are, how disturbing to good play your attitude is, and what a genuine problem you are - if you remain one. Otherwise, lets have a great ship - and you act so good that when the judges check this ship, they might even consider accepting this post as your warning and give you another chance. That would please me more then anything, and I'm going to be talking about how great things are now instead."</p><p>to having 5+ people decide they agree the ship's better off with Mr.RudeJerk dead and making it happen.</p><p>to whatever else you think of - but reporting it <em>should</em> be part of the solution.</p><br><p>You are <em>anything</em> but powerless. And that's a huge thing that this game is about teaching. Here's your 16 characters, adrift, lost, with absolutely no one to call on for help except each other - no matter what - and at least 2 of that team are absolute genocidal traitors. It's not about being powerless and victimized - this game is about facing those odds, finding the strength and building the team to overcome this desperate situation, and about making it through, getting each other through whatever comes.</p><p>This game is exactly the opposite of being helpless, of giving up, of being a victim that cannot do anything about it, whatever <em>it</em> is.</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1721761 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1721761">spacekadt</span></span><cite>Good god some of you are awesome at not fully reading.</cite><br><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> In my case, I'm answering someone else's pain.</p>

                <p>Oh sweet, a topic I'm an expert on.</p><p>Thing to keep in mind is that most of the "jerks" you encounter on these ships really don't mean anything personal by their remarks - it's just how they voice their points, views or opinions that rub people the wrong way.</p><p>It's the strategy/gameplay conflicts that cause a jerk's personality to flare up a bit. Thing is, it's different for everyone. I've seen people be absolute asshats over only very specific people eating rations. I've seen crew members be jerks over what projects are optimal based on the situation. Hell my biggest thing that sets me off personally is killing inactives. I am all for gutting them early on - but I often get into arguments with people wanting to do the "wait and see" approach in the hopes they will starve off. Oh boy will that set me off.</p><p>When I call you an unoptimal human player or E-honor idiot over your views that voluntary mush testing is terribly unfair, I don't mean it personally - really. It just means that I VERY strongly disagree to the point where we will not be able to compromise on this particular issue.</p><p>Yeah, I''m personally an asshole over my views, but if you would ever message me on the side and tell me that me calling you an insufferable dumbass bothers you - I would apologize to you. Just because I'm a jerk doesn't mean I can't or wont agree with any of your views. It just means there are certain decisions I am polarly opposed to you on.<br><br>Jerks aren't inflexible and can be worked with (sometimes), and they don't act like jerks just because. Just keep in mind if they are insulting or getting angry it's likely just because they feel very strongly set in their opinion over something. That is the core issue you two should work out. Don't take it personally and try to open a side chat and hash it out with them. Just a thought.</p>

                <p>There's valid SDF precedent for the "wait and see" approach, though. Namely, killing too many inactives early on can lead to serious early morale problems, especially if people restored the Sol link before the ship was full. If you don't have any evidence of their being Mush, OR their inactivity isn't directly interfering with ship operations, say stealing Paola or Jin's Logistics bonus, then it could be treated the same as a random killing without evidence. I've been on more than a few murderships that were made far worse by a few active people insisting on killing the inactives.</p><p>IF they come back and start griefing, you still have the option to report and kill them.</p><p>There's also the possibility that inactive players may come back and be quite useful, and it's happened on ships of mine before.</p><p>There's also the point that you can shove them into a storage room and trade them. Killing them is no longer the "default" option, nor should it ever have been.</p>

                <p>When has morale been that much of an issue - seriously? Especially now that that Andie doesn't have to spend AP to actually use his morale skill and the recipient does. With Jin, Janice KT, Andie (confident and bisexual), Schrodinger and doing the thing - if morale is a big issue you have other problems on your hands. I play KT 80% of the time anyways so with Leadership if anyone bitches about that one morale loss I'll just toss them a goddamn speech if it's that huge of a deal for them.</p><p>I have never seen an inactive player come back after days and start being helpful. You have more ships than me so I'm sure you've seen it happen but why would you let that hold you back? And as for trading...really? I mean really? You need to use the hilariously bad and utterly wasteful mechanics of wrangling them into a storage room (requiring an active person with the skill to even do it) and an active coms manager to complete the trade. It is not worth the time and AP spent when they could just be killed off with less headaches, time, AP or people needed. Hell most of the trader system is garbage but that is a complaint for another thread.</p><p>I am not talking about mass murdering everyone that hasn't spoken in 4 cycles on day 2. I'm talking about those two or three bronze players who obviously stopped half way through the tutorial or spent 7 actions solving the kube and then went braindead since then without saying a word.</p><p>There is no reason to keep these people around as possible mush. If it turns out they were mush - great, they were inactive anyways so they likely wouldn't have done much to the ship regardless. If they aren't mush though - it tells you your mush are definately active and you need to act accordingly (which you should be doing anyways but still it's good to be positive).</p><p>The mush hunt needs to end as soon as possible. Ap spent doing mush prevention research and hunting is better spent on neron upgrades, plannet scanning for map fragments or other things. It's suboptimal to keep the mush hunt going longer - so if your mush might be inactive, why "wait and see"?</p><p>As I said before, this is one of the topics that I will not change my view on. Arguing over this is just going to shit up a decent thread so it would be best to agree to disagree. But if we end up in a ship together we can debate this all you want, bud.</p>

It's all well and good to assume that the person being a jerk may not realize it, but it can cause a lot of anxiety if, say, you actually feel they may be bullying and the responsibility falls on the person being called names to do something.</p><p>I get that it needs to be done by someone, but sometimes asking the person who's offended to talk to the person who offended them, one on one, is not as viable an option as it seems.

                <p>Oh I understand and can agree with you Ink - if someone is very confrontational in their views it might feel pointless to try and talk to them seperately. That's my point though - try it out. It might seem intimidating (really, I can understand why it would) but the majority of us are actually not as bad as you would think and we generally don't mean what we say personally.</p><p>It's a crappy deal, I know, but it actually is the best way to try and deal with jerks on a ship. Just try it once and you'll be surprised I think. You likely wont sort out your issues (when I am an asshole over a topic I normally am not changing my mind unless its based around a mechanic that I don't understand fully) but you will make them think a bit more about your feelings when they make their counterpoints.</p><p>I think this is actually a very good topic to have since there are some people so overbearing in their views it really puts a damper on the ship, and the ship's mood. I'm a jerk but I've seen some people that really go pretty far in voicing their opinions and cutting others down. It's not very newbie friendly (something I often get chaff for on my ships) and drives people away from the game. So I think more discussion on this is a good thing.</p><p>That said, if someone is really pushing it, just report them like it's been said. It's one thing for someone to get mad at you and call you an idiot or say you don't understand X mechanic and must be a noob; but quite another for someone to threaten you constantly without reason, insult you nonstop, etc. The difference is finding those that are just really opinionated on their views, and those that just make the whole environment toxic.</p>

Such is my core personality.</p><p>Anyway, to summarise, if you're gonna tell others to "deal with it" when it comes to your core personality, perhaps you should listen to your own advice and accept that people are going to complain about you publically. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>(p.s.

                <p>Candidly, what bothers me most about all this is that you are playing a game anonymously and you are not even *supposed* to be playing your own personality (I know one can't quite avoid that). I don't know whether it disturbs me more that people can't get over minor slights or that they are concerned about bullying. Well, actually, what disturbs me most is that people won't take this opportunity to educate themselves socially by handling minor problems at a distance, maybe experimenting with different modes of conflict resolution. There's no personal threat involved. It's Chun or Derek who's having to deal with it, not you. Point them in the right direction - then learn from it yourself.

That doesn't mean they'll want to sit back; some people are more proactive about creating an environs they can enjoy/tolerate. I think also, people who are naturally chatty/positive types, as well as very empathetic individuals, will probably raise hackles faster than those who are used to blending or mediating. I think that's a big part of human nature, the struggling of personalities coexisting to create an environs that suites their behavior best (also what we look for in social groups, so not surprised it's started showing up in social games such as this).</p>
