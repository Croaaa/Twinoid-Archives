                <p>Hi! I was Paola here. Let me just pen my thoughts here. After going through several very inactive ships mostly ending on Day 3, it was getting pretty tiresome. So, I was pleasantly surprised by an active Commander Jin Su on Day 1.</p><p>Stephen, Janice, Raluca, Frieda (newbie), Terrence, Hua and Finola were all active to varying degrees.</p><p>And it all began so splendidly well, except for Hua taking out the Pasiphae and not landing for about 1~2 days. I started my NERON upgrades for the first 3 days and viola, one gift after another.</p><p>1. General Patch Up for 4ap<br>2. Quantum Sensors for 6ap<br>3. Plasma Shields for 8ap</p><p>And I haven't even started on the Rebel Base on Day 3 yet. Suffice to say, I hit the Xyloph DB for the Rebel Base comms bonus and est. contact with all Rebel Bases post Day 3. Such a promising beginning. We had pilots actively getting scraps and Terrence banging away in upgrading the drones.</p><p>Things were going swimmingly well, too well except on the Mush front. We were slow on anti-mush research and basically had no idea who could be Mush. Several people were inactive, including Roland, Eleesha and Kuan Ti (became active later). We were content to let things be when disaster struck on D4~5.</p><p>Roland went berzerk and started hitting poor Kuan Ti at Bravo Dorm and managed to kill him. Took a couple of punches at Terrence and then fled to the Refectory and mutated. I took a couple of shots at him and Jin Su killed him. Unfortunately, he caused even greater psychological damage.</p><p>Because we had absolutely NO IDEA who the Mush was, we started suspecting the inactives and people who were acting suspicious. One after another died, starting wtih Eleesha, then Stephen and Gioele. By that time, it became crystal clear that Finola was the Mush.</p><p>We basically wanted to cure her, but she was very slow-going on the Mush serum. Unfortunately, Hua took things on her own hands and killed Finola. At that time, it was down to 8 people.</p><p>Jin Su, me, Frieda, Janice, Raluca, Hua, Terrence and Chun. Unfortunately Chun was inactive and died not long after. We rallied around our Leader, Jin Su. Things were going swimmingly well, with full O2 and fuel. We did an expo a day and was doing ok but no luck with Starmaps.</p><p>Unfortunately, on FUBAR Expo #5&amp;6, we lost Raluca. Then we lost Frieda, our only Astro due to a freak ceiling accident and fire breaking out in Alpha Dorm. Frieda became TOAST literally. With only 3 really active people, Jin Su, Janice and myself left, we had no choice but to come back to SOL.</p><p>***<br>I want to state that once the Mush were killed, we worked swimmingly well together. <br><br>Jin Su - one of the best Commanders ever. Unfortunately, a bit bloodthirsty at the beginning, which led to some unfortunate em... accidents.<br><br>Janice - the best shrink and botanist ever. Always ready to lend a helping hand. Get diplo next time and we can have great adventures on expos.<br><br>Frieda - even though you new to the game, you did a great job as an Astro. Sure some minor mistakes were made, but all part of the learning experience.<br><br>Raluca - fun gal to be around with once you got to know her. She was invaluable in fixing stuff over the place.<br><br>Terrence and Hua - although you guys were a bit quiet, you did your job well. Terrence was especially great in banging up the drones upgrades. Them drones really helped in repairing O2 tanks, Fuel tanks and Patrol Ships so many times!</p>

This pretty well sums the ship up. I don't have much to add to your version of events (same in my journal, mostly).<br>Sorry for being so cruel in the beginning. The thought of a mush on my ship drives me mad and I kill everyone slightly suspicious. But then I become nice and careful <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>I really learned a lot in this trip, like carrying the plants to prevent fire damage (it's amazing how much you learn each time, even after 50+ ships). <br>And I adored the way Raluca named the coffees, each time anew <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I'll miss that.</p>

                <p>Hi! I was Raluca. This crew was pretty awesome. We had a pretty close-knit inner circle, which worked a bit as a double-edged sword; we worked really well together but it seems to have confused some people who were outside of it.</p><p>Stephen was a useful and knowledgeable guy, but his actions and attitude painted him as a possible mush. That obviously wasn't enough to kill him, but around the same time Roland mutated, Stephen picked up the blaster and med kit from the research lab <em>after</em> Jin Su and others announced there were doing research related to those items. Alarms went off when he picked them up and left. We naturally thought this was some sort of coordinated attack. So Stephen died as a victim of (at the time) extremely suspicious circumstances.</p><p>I wasn't involved in Gioele's death, but we had talked about Gioele as a possible mush for quite some time before it happened.</p><p>As for mush Finola... We knew Finola was mush by process of elimination; everyone else still alive was either tested or had an illness treated. We were in the beginning stages of working on the serum when she got killed; and she had to be killed when Hua attacked her in med lab and let the cat out of the bag, there was no way to pretend we didn't suspect her after that. I'm a little disappointed that Finola turned out to be a benign mush; we had made her part of the inner circle, and there were many consumables in research lab that she could have double or triple spored (Paola actually thought that she had spored one of the Anabolics doses). Finola had the potential to do some serious damage to us. But our guesses during the game turned out to be right, and she was a mush that wanted to be converted. It was an interesting problem, I think we handled it the best way that we could by assuming Finola wasn't going to play against her team, and not negotiating with her after Hua started the initial attack. I actually thought it was Hua at first, since she started the attack, but then I tried healing her and the message that her Slight Nausea had been healed made it clear that she was human.</p><p>Finishing PILGRED was a breeze since we had a second sofa. Things got a little more boring after that, but I tried my best to make sure coffees were getting dispensed and doors were getting repaired. I should have healed up before that last expo, but I might have died anyway since I was suffering the wrath of the RNG gods.</p><p>All in all, one of the best ships I've been on! Between Paola and I, we should have been able to get to Eden, but since we never found any starmaps anyway, maybe it's just as well.</p>

I also write long endscreen messages and they get hard to read.<br>As for you and your character... I really like what you did and me (as well as the whole core 5 - Paola, Frieda, Raluca, Janice and me) was inclined to keeping you alive. But then Hua took matters into her own hands and started hitting you. We decided you could wake up, see you've been discovered, mutate and start breaking people and stuff. So we took a safer exit, though we didn't want to. Besides, keeping you alive by that point would mean to break the rules.</p>

It was Roland killing Kuan Ti and then mutating, that started making us extremely paranoid. It didn't help that you took the Blaster and Medkit from the Medlab without telling anyone and dropping them at the Rear Corridor.</p><p>We did a reasonably good job, but Chun was inactive. Terrence and Hua were only active in 1~2 cycles a day, so the 5 of us did a reasonably great job. It was just a pity, you did what you did at the Medlab.

It was I, Paola who realized Stephen had moved the items and asked him why <em>on the Public Channel</em>. Stephen moved the items B4 Roland attacked Kuan Ti. I think Roland saw that Stephen had moved the Blaster and Medkit to god knows where or was holding it, and took this as a great opportunity to kill Kuan Ti and Terrence. He didn't have any weapons, so only killed Kuan Ti.</p><p>BTW ~ Oooh... nice to meet a fellow Asimov fan. Ah, those Robot Novels and the Three Law of Robotics were the best!</p>

                <p>The last time I played against a mush Finola, we got to Day 3 without antispore gas being finished, and it ended with a stand-off involving Finola, Chao, and an inactive Ian in research, Stephen and Gioele guarding the central corridor, and Eleesha getting stabbed nearly to death, and everyone else either trying to help or trying to work on the ship. We lost a day due to the stand-off while hunters kept dinging our hull, and we ended up getting wrecked.</p><p>So although it isn't easy, it is definitely possible to play a mush Finola well.</p>
