                <p>I'm sorry this got so long, that's just the way it goes.</p><p>I don't have an end link yet. We'll get to that.</p><p>So you're all on the internet. You've all seen <a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/8Ck_6duAXvw">this video</a>. Imagine Frieda on the Daedalus singing her own lyics:</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">When I was young<br>The mushrooms were found in dung<br>And watching stars was just for fun<br>Those days are gone<br>Sleepin' alone<br>In cryo frozen to the bone<br>Attended to by just a drone<br>Nobody's home<br><br>All by myself<br>Don't wanna be<br>All by myself<br>Anymore<br><br>Now there are mush<br>Another human just got crushed<br>They looked infected at first blush<br>The kill's a rush<br><br>All by myself<br>Now I seem to be<br>All by myself<br>Forevermore<br>All by myself<br>Now I seem to be<br>All by myself<br>Forevermore<br><br>Now they are gone<br>Don't think that I'll see the dawn<br>Time continues to drag on<br>Still have NERON<br><br>All by myself<br>I really am<br>All by myself<br>From now on<br>All by myself<br>I'm gonna live<br>Oh<br>I'm gonna live<br>By myself, by myself<br>Gonna live<br>By myself <br>Gonna live<br>Oh<br>All by myself<br>I'm gonna live</span></span></p><p>So. Let's start back at the beginning.</p><p>There was a general hesitation to act on the mush hunt for some reason. I'm sure Chun being afk at the start of the ship and a whole slew of inactives didn't make it easy.</p><p>I (Frieda) started off by finding us a nice little planet to visit. It didn't have oxygen, but it had Cristalite, Orchards, Shipwreck, Fuel and a few other goodies. As long as Andie went along, it was a cakewalk. So Ian heads to Icarus Bay and is shortly followed by Gioele and Andie. Only Gioele and Andie didn't take spacesuits so Ian went on expo alone. And got smacked by the shipwreck shortly after finding a map fragment. So that's one down.</p><p>I'll be damned if I can remember why now, but next was Jin Su.. slain by me after discussion with Paola and Eleesha (and I think Chun showed up around this point). I know we suspected him of being mush, but I can't remember why.</p><p>Our Janice. Oh lord our Janice. Went idle at the bridge for about a day, then idled in the lab for another half a day or so, then announced that she was going to alpha dorm and doing absolutely nothing else and wouldn't be back online at all. She got to live by virtue of Jin Su being dead, Andie not having confidant and the desperate need for morale.</p><p>Then we had Hua starve before I went and killed Stephen. It was his first game and he had logged off after the tutorial and idled on bridge for days sucking up the logistics. That and he should have been starving and didn't seem to actually be taking any damage at cycle change. But somehow, human and survived WAY longer than we thought should be possible.</p><p>We let a lot of time pass here because we were a tad gun-shy of killing more humans. Paola was pretty convinced that Derek was an idle mush and was getting ready to go kill him, but then he died of depression at day change.</p><p>And this is where Terrence made a fatal mistake. "Terrence : How about we just repair that Pilgred and go home, regardless of the Mush? Or do we start rampaging? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">"</p><p>So I see this and take it as a mush taunting us and take off with the knife and kill the crap outta Terrence. Human. Note to everyone, never say "we" when discussing the mush unless you want someone to run off and stab you.</p><p>At this point, Paola, Eleesha, Chun and I are laughing our asses off at ourselves. And knowing the mush are laughing as well. Hell, we're failhunters for sure. So we decide to say screw it and get aggressive.</p><p>Terrence had been talking to Paola or Eleesha (I think Eleesha) about thinking Andie is mush. We kept thinking no way... totally gotta be human. Until some AP needs come up and despite saying that s/he's going to eat so s/he doesn't starve, s/he can't seem to make it back to Icarus to do a second expo to the planet. Based on this, Paola catches Andie a few cycles later with the knife. FINALLY! A mush!</p><p>Then Eleesha goes to print the list and it consists of Jin Su, Roland, Chun, Paola and Eleesha. One's dead, Chun's guaranteed human. Paola and Eleesha haven't been cleared that I've seen with my own eyes, but absolutely certain they're human. So out comes the trusty knife that gets plunged into Roland. Also a mush, but hey look... now there's a dead mush and still a mush in the crew bar! Sneaky little bastard that he is...</p><p>Next to go was Gioele. Another case of suspicious of mush but no super strong confirmation. At the very least, we needed to run like hell from a slew of hunters and we really needed someone that would actually do it more often than once every day and a half so we promoted me to Commander. But also, human.</p><p>A few minutes later, Eleesha took out Kuan Ti when we realized that despite having Designer, hadn't been in Nexus at all at any point where logs were kept. Oops. Human.</p><p>At the next cycle change, Janice starved which caused Chun to die by domino effect due to depression.</p><p>There are 4 of us left. Me, Eleesha, Paola, Raluca. Eleesha went through a moment of thinking Paola duped us until I pointed out that she's got a very eager mush kill under her belt.</p><p>Eleesha and I tried to get Raluca to finish PILGRED so we could get back to Sol, but despite trying to play human, she started to play with demoralizing. Once I figured out it was her and not Eleesha, I stabbed her a few times (thankfully I had one minute auto-refresh going so I caught it super early). I got 4 or 5 stabs in before she ran, but she ran well! Paola and Eleesha took off with their remaining AP to try to get her once she "ended" in medlab. They got a few stabs in, then she ran again! Paola realized she could eat and took off after her and finally killed her.</p><p>Then this conversation happened: <a href="http://www.spacekadt.com/20140613070015412.png" target="_blank">http://www.spacekadt.com/201406130700...</a></p><p>Lost Eleesha at the next cycle change (which was also day change) due to morale. Paola took some sheet metal at the start of cycle 4 after we did some glory research. Now it's just me. And I'm hanging out at the bridge scanning new planets just because I can. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>While I expect to die soon, who knows when it'll happen. Still at 12 health and 4 morale... so I should have a few cycles left in me!</p><p>To the humans that died: I apologize. We really did think you were mush for whatever reason and we all acknowledge how hard we failed. It was by far my worst ship mush-hunting-wise... but also one of the most fun ships I've ever played.</p>

                <p>Paola here, and i still had too much fun on this ship. Got two mush kills under my belt and feeling fine. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Jin Su died as he was on the first expo instead of Andie. that's why we blamed him for the Ian's death and therefor killed him. Also, this pretty much caused a bunch of future events, including our reluctance to kill crucial crewmates. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I loved the point when there was just me, Frieda, Eleesha, and Reluca and both Frieda and Eleesha started private chats with me about plans to catch the other out on mushy activity. Frieda had ate four times though in once cycle, I had proven myself to having depression because of Janice, and Eleesha killed Roland so I kinda knew the truth, But man did that confuse me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I think if Chun was a little more active this would have turned out differently as we could have gotten more research done, Or if Jin Su and Ian hadn't died right away on that fail Expo. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>First time I have even seen one shard of the starmap though, so that was new to me. I will get to Eden someday... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/drowl.png" alt=":drowl:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I kinda knew i was going to get plated, even though i was on 7 health when I went to bed. In two cycles i was thrown to the floor and then steel debris landed on my head. It's always the way, but I was in worse situations moral wise as i was full and had only one moral so of course I could not eat anything. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/puke.png" alt="°x°" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Pity i didn't get time to make my N/R/J/ this time but i got a memento from it anyway. Also i kinda have been recording this ship so at some point i will upload that to youtube if no-one has too many objections. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
