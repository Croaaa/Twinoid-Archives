Returned to Sol.</p><p>Chun here.<br>All I have to say is that DAMN YOU RNGESUS! All scan and no Fragment makes Chun a Lethargic girl.<br>On our long, long journey, we had gained 2 starmap fragments but the third (or the first for some time) did not appear for us. Instead, we have gained infection, infection, Mia, killed in a row, so thank you space Odin for cursing us.<br>The other big problem was the fact that we had spend... ~5 days searching for Fuel, as on the first 10days zero HC zones were revealed. <br>IF we had been more lucky, maybe Eden would have been possible, although there was little more we could have done.<br>All of our crew were active and doing it's job as the ship went on with 12 people for quite some while!<br>Grats for Andie on expo management, Frieda on commanding, heck, grats to all the crew as even without one of you it would have been less possible to do Eden. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>About the mush phase... Someone must have facepalmed really, really hard that day. I'm sure someone else can explain what happened in greater detail (as I have to go soon), but simply put:</p><p>Day1: I was the first to wake up (as Chun), gathering a few essentials, hiding all the weapons, getting apron and sample as 10+ people were in the laboratory from not knowing the casting even started.<br>Mush sees this opportunity, 3 of them talk in a private channel on what to do. They agree on transferring to Eleesha and going for the long game if I remember correctly. However, problem was that as "someone" transferred...he forgot to close his private tabs. <br>..See where this is going? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br>With me and a few random people invited to that chat, it was quite obvious who the two mushes were and they were swiftly dealt with. On day 1, two less mushes, one confirmed by the new research.<br>Our biggest hunch was that hey either transferred into Jin Su or Eleesha, based on the group talks.</p><p>Problem was that...Gioele, oh Gioele. Dear god, it felt like a Russian Moba player talking to us.<br>By his incompetence, barely legitible talking, not true information talks, we had to kill him, since he created more confusion every time he talked, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A CONFIRMED HUMAN! To this day I have zero idea what happened to that man, but I know that on one occasion I had to scream into a pillow because of his writing.<br>Nevertheless, Gioele bought enough time for the 3rd mush to think (unsure how much, about 4-5 days?) by the confusion he made. We had dealt with Jin Su early on (Derek was too much of a man and killed him, even if I wanted to be the last to check glory), but hesitated on Eleesha for some time.<br>Fortunately, she barely did anything,being under close observation which she probably felt. We also tried to hide the fact that the channel was left open, so the one remaining won't rampage on us.<br>With Raluca's Genius, we quickly got Retro-Fungal-Serum, and the ship got <em>offically mush free!<br></em><br>From that day, it was just the fact of sleeping, scanning, expoing, healing, repeat till the end of time.<br>Our fate was completely in RNG's hand, and it has failed us with a third fragment. <br>However, our crew didn't fail anyone, and did this beautifully. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/loc/fr/notes/Plus1.png" alt=":teacher_bobj_1:" class="tid_img tid_parsed" style=""></p>

                <p>So I was Raluca <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/raluca_tomescu.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RT:" class="tid_ico"> on this ship.</p><p>I think it was the longest journey I ever had, those last few days were really tiring... and taking into consideration the time it couldn't been worse. I guess because of Easter people didn't had enough time to take care of each other. <br>Kinda sad I died just before return to Sol and little Ralu-Ti never saw the real world... But never the less it was awesome ship.</p><p>Taking down two mushes wasn't that hard... I'm sorry it ended like that for you folks, you didn't had a chance to achieve anything. Finding the third should be easy as well, but because of little confusion it last longer than expected and taken Jin Su in the process - which was a great lose, especially that next in command was Gioele... <br>Andie sorry for not telling the truth about the Mush private chat... but Chun wanted to have as little information about it outside of the small group that I didn't had much of a choice. You were great doing all those expos alone (But I still think you had that desire to become Mush and that is why you were always finding mush traps).</p><p>Anyway third mush joined human side. Gioele was sent to a vacation with alien species. And the fight with RNG started.</p><p>My favourite part of the ship? Seeing how my little play thing Kuan Ti changed into a father and teasing Derek every time I saw opportunity. I tried to stay inside the character, I hope I didn't offended anyone.</p><p>Janice, don't worry... We couldn't achieve that day without you. You were great with keeping people alive and at the end it was the most important job.</p>

                <p>Jin Su here, I knew I was dead when I logged in 12 hours after the game started (damn manual starts) and Chun didn't open a message box with me. If she did open one with me and one with Eleesha then she would have seen who was online at the time rather then needing to kill one of us randomly. The origional eleesha was very confident that he was Gioele, a story that didn't really add up and I got killed in the crossfire.</p><p>Since I knew I was pretty much dead, my main goal was to get dirty / go into bravo drom. Most of the game I stood around in the lab, I finished C. Serum and worked on research whenever the restrictions didn't prevent me - otherwise when I was full on AP I would give speeches. I was hesitant to go on the first expo (only for food) since I thought the hacker kit couldn't go on expos (I've since tested it and you can bring it) and there wasn't an urgent need until we had a fire in the refractory. The expo was a mess in itself since a random break in the engine room forced us to stay there another 2 cycles (I wasn't going to risk getting dirty to fix it) . I did say something on each of the 6 cycles I was active (asleep cycles 3 &amp; 4) and told everyone who the missions went to so nobody would think they went to a hidden alpha. Unfortunately, the same Chun who could have opened a chat box to get the 3rd alpha, killed me without talking to the rest of the crew so they could put a semi-active gioele in command.</p><p>Humans were lucky that the mush gave away his 2 partners but it wasn't much of a hunt.</p>

                <p>I was the Chun as mentioned.</p><p>So..since it seems I was the devil in killing you, it is fair to reply to these accusations. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><cite>I knew I was dead when I logged in 12 hours after the game started (damn manual starts) and Chun didn't open a message box with me. If she did open one with me and one with Eleesha then she would have seen who was online at the time rather then needing to kill one of us randomly.</cite></p><p>I feel that you have about half the story of what happened, or less/more, I don't know. You were <em>NOT </em>a random kill. The day defacing happened was day1, and as you mention, you had time to act and do things, so it wasn't an immediate threat of random violence from defacing.<br>I have directly did not have anything against you or any people who were late to connect, for the exact reasons you said: Manual start and literally nobody was prepared for it, making me lucky to be online and getting the first run around, while also making lucky that the mushes woke early. You were the last to wake up but that wasn't a problem.<br>The problem was that it was 100% a transfer happened and Jin Su is usually the main suspect of it for obvious reasons.<br>The second problem was that I was on almost full three channels all the time. The way you say it points me as for not noticing these things, but it could have been just as easy for you to, you know, TALK to me to save yourself if you beleived you were "already dead". I usually PM mandatory people on a random ship, but since this was a casting were all people are competent, I did not.<br>Thirdly, the problem was Gioele who majorly effed up the mush hunt. I would almost say that becuase of his actions did we go for killing you. There was also the fact that then mush Eleesha started heating Derek to kill you all the time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We had two kills but the third one was foggy. We either beleived what they talked in the group channel and went for Eleesha, <em>contradicting</em> with what a CONFIRMED HUMAN Gioele told, or went for the more usual approach of thinking the commander transfer. This added that we did not know if the transfer actually happened or not, plus the timing of it compared to the defacing.</p><br><p><cite>Unfortunately, the same Chun who could have opened a chat box to get the 3rd alpha, killed me without talking to the rest of the crew so they could put a semi-active gioele in command.</cite><br>IF you truly beleived that Eleesha had such an obvious alibi problem, then do tell us. Do you seriously want to say that you didn't message me this information in any way, but withhold it, then blame me for the death that you saw coming?<br>It wasn't just me, but Andie, Frieda and Raluca (If I remember correctly) who talked this through and through for <em>multiple days on multiple scenarios.</em><br>Gioele was an incompetent fool, but a fool we KNEW was human. He was swiftly traded away when we could, but that was part of the deal of killing the last mush, in order of possibilities, making You first, then Eleesha second.</p><br><p>This was no random killing as you want to show it, but a deliberate risk that we took. If we were in the same position, I would have done it again. Others can share their thoughts on this, since yours is quite the accusation of me effing up, which I showed why I reject.</p>

                <p>Yeah, I was Stephen and I did not transfer. I was the one who started the private channel that killed us all. We started off decently well and the transfer into Eleesha was brought up well and we decided it was a good idea as Eleesha would be the primary mush hunter. However, as soon as the transfer was complete Eleesha posts in the mush channel "I forgot to close the tab." This of course is doom for us unless we kill off Gioele quickly. Solid being bugged, I can't kick Ian out of the room. We don't have the AP to kill Gioele because of Ian so we hope he doesn't log in. Of course, Gioele finally logs in and its clearly game over, so I have a little fun taunting people before I get absolutely flattened by Raluca. Looking back, it occurs to me that I should have instead transferred into Gioele after closing my tab, and then playing from there, but such is the constraints of a panic driven morning when I'm also walking into work and checking in every five minutes on my phone under the desk.</p>

                <p>Andie checking in!</p><p>This was an awesome journey with a lot of excitement. The start some super confusing with the dual body transfer. I'm not even sure if I still know what happened there. What I do know is we knocked out an unbelievable amount of expos. Frieda and I were some sync'd that we knocked out three expos over the course of a day. Props go out to those behind the scenes on the astro scanning crew for making it all possible.</p>

There's not much else you can do other than stay in a camera'ed room, avoid bravo dorm, and act in intelligent manner that covers the obligations for your role. Since Paola had logistic expert that meant staying in the lab and funneling the extra 7 AP a day into research, watering plants, or speeches. Meanwhile your eleesha extracted more spores and spiked people.</p><br><cite>The problem was that it was 100% a transfer happened and Jin Su is usually the main suspect of it for obvious reasons.</cite><p>Only during expos when Jin su stays behind, otherwise it's normally chao and eleesha. Jin su is too restrictive, he has to go on every expo and you generally avoid non-O2 expos until mush are killed. Why would a mush transfer to just stand in a lab and do research and go on dangerous expos? Also I was a gold level 3 before and after. You can only be a level 3 or 5 Gold to do that transfer and it meant both mush AND human would have been gold - was gioele even gold or level 3 jin su (did you even ask him)?</p><cite>The second problem was that I was on almost full three channels all the time.</cite><p>Close a channel and ask them to re-invite you before you leave - that's just poor play.</p><cite>but since this was a casting were all people are competent</cite><p>You caught 2 mush because an alpha gave up his partners - did I really play like someone who would do that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"> ?</p><cite>IF you truly beleived that Eleesha had such an obvious alibi problem, then do tell us. Do you seriously want to say that you didn't message me this information in any way, but withhold it, then blame me for the death that you saw coming?</cite><p>Withhold it ....? You never had a free chat open, you're contradicting yourself (also, you didn't share the mush PM with the rest of the crew so I had no idea what was going on behind the scenes which is why I mostly stayed in the lab announcing where the missions went so you knew where they were going and how much AP to count).</p><br><cite>If we were in the same position, I would have done it again. Others can share their thoughts on this, since yours is quite the accusation of me effing up, which I showed why I reject.</cite><p>I don't blame you for killing me .... just for bad mush hunting. Before I left, all I saw was Andie asking what was going on so it looked like I was killed by a vocal minority that didn't collect logs. Who knows what would have happened if Frieda had extra AP to scan for planets + missions rather then pilot the ship.</p>

                <p>Hi guys!</p><p><strong>Derek here.</strong></p><p>I never wanted to play <strong>Chao</strong> or <strong>Derek</strong>, since I hate executing people, and I'm bad at mush hunting <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> So I was a bit disappointed that the RNG had choosen me for this role. I quickly gathered information about how to play Derek but I cannot get too many info. Anyway I like playing support characters without specific usefull skills so I wanted to get rid of the last mush and do projects and stuff.</p><p>At the start that transfer was very suspicious, I just cannot believe they do so obvious mistakes (transfering, leaving channels open, extracting spores in front of everybody), Gioele made a lot of suspicious move and announcement, and he just logged in in the right time to toss out Ian and kill people so the following was my theory <em>(I was totally wrong)</em>:<br>- there were 2 transfers at least and maybe one of them went back to his original body (confusing people)<br>- mushes created a fake private chanel<br>- Gioele was a mush and he started shouting "I'm transfered' to confuse us and to start killing innocent people (fake mush channel)<br>- Mushes extracted a lot of spores and they were all active so I thought they already infected their first beta at day 1.<br>- in the killing spree 1 mushes dead by accident or intentionally<br>- Frieda constantly healing Gioele, but how he lost as much damage? (i can't see in the logs he injured, I didn't believed in defacer then)<br>- Frieda is a mush too healing Gioele who losing HP because of the showers (also Gioele was dirty most of the time), or maybe Gioele asked naive Frieda to heal him in a private channel</p><p>I was wrong in so many aspects, anyway I can't contacted <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/zhong_chun.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_ZC:" class="tid_ico"> Chun so I contacted <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/eleesha_williams.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_EW:" class="tid_ico"> Eleesha (another mistake, she was the transfered mush), and we started discussing Gioele and Frieda, also we started planning his killing. We just collected AP and Eleesha provided a <em>blaster</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"> to me (I was shooter and wrestler at that moment).</p><p>I don't really liked Gioele and I was sure he is mush, I punched him to get out of bed and stuff, I was mean with him.</p><p>Just before we started the killing spree I tried to contact with Chun last time and she opened a private channel for me, we started discuss and she told me that Gioele is confirmed human, but doing mushy thing all day, she wanted <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/kim_jin_su.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_KJS:" class="tid_ico"> Jin Su dead. I did not really know why, she told me Jin Su was there when the transfer occured, later Eleesha joined, she also be surprised about why Chun want Jin Su dead but she started supporting Chun fast, and we planed killing Jin Su AND THEN Gioele. I was the executor, but I totally messed up, mashing the wrong buttons, tossing Ian and Jin Su from room to room instead of punching him, he died fast, no glory, only sorrow remanied...</p><p>Chun announced that the killing was coordinated by her and we left Gioele alive 'Enough killing today'.</p><p>I totally regreted killing Jin Su, and I thought I'm in trouble, messing stuff, I started doing general things, assembling sofa for Paola and stuff.</p><p>Later on suddenly we had the antiserum, and turned out they cured Eleesha.<br>Eleesha started provoke me to do the thing, and we did for some time without getting pregnant.<br>Raluca started teasing me, insulting and stuff, I only hoped she RP but I wasn't sure, I made some noob stuff, and when I was bored I reported things and answering here and there, I didn't want to annoy you guys, so I started to shut up and tried to be nicer with Raluca (I just cannot start like Raluca till end, and she not really helped with this)</p><p>Then Raluca get pregnant, she changed a bit in her mood.</p><p>I got the pilot book and reactivated Gold, chose firefighter and started collecting XP for Boring Speech. I was the most manly man on board: wrestler, shoother, pilot, firefighter! But girls didn't wanted me, only Eleesha, I mostly waited girls at Medlab, what Eleesha called <strong>*'Derek's Looooove nest'</strong> Paola said that 'he is mine!' when I completed the Sofa, but then later nothing happened. (I wanted collecting some personal glory but the glory description for Derek is confusing)</p><p>From day 10 we mostly made fixes, shooting and expos, not so interesting, I really liked the RP what were in public chat and in private with Eleesa. We also made a baby <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Last day I killed in an expo while I was offline, what a loss, I kept reading the public chat after my death, I saw Raluca killed by her injuries and the general morale degraded a bit. They sayed bye-bye to us in public chat I read everything, the most silent comrades (who only reported stuff and not so communicated or RP) wrote the most heartwarming stuff at chat (Hua, Andie, Terrence),. What a surprise, and I thought I annoy them <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Than you guys! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I saw that they ran out of options fast and forced to go home next time, 24h after my death.</p><p>That was my first CASTING ship, my first &gt;20 day, I liked it a lot! I just want to go to Eden finally!</p><p>~Derek</p>

                <p>Yeah I liked a lot the grumpy antisocial Raluca character, that was entertaining, really, I just feared that I'm playing like a noob and that is why you hurt specially Derek, and always just him. I know i maybe should be more aggressive to stay inside my character, but I jist flee everytime you was mean, I rather wanted peace after the mush killed than start punching like I did with Gioele.</p><p>I wonder how you guys playing from mobile, it's always freezing when I'm at Icarus and I try to interact with doors or shelf. Also I cannot take of with patroller from Android, freezes every time. Also these custom textfields always messed up in Androidwhat I wrote, I just cannot delete some letters 'coz it started writing words without spaces. There was times when I was in readonly mode, cannot write anything. I booted up my Win8 tablet and that totally worth, It has no mobile internet access but it is just perfect when I can connect to WIFI, and far faster than from mobile.</p><p>And Paola, she just traded his father away to an alien species without giving a sh*t, and I thought that Raluca is antipatic. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I got as little flirt I just cannot believe, I think only Eleesha and Paola flirted with me, and no one else. I should be too brash.</p>
