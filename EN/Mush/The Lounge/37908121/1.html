If Terrence hadn't been a crazy berzerker and Raluca hadn't been that odd afk ghost, we might have survived all the breakage and fires and oh, the endless Pilgred relays with 1% advances... still, it was good going and good fun.</p><p>Now, the one thing that drove me nuts (in the best possible way) was seeing that Janice had been Mush all along. Janice, who had been faithfully at our side from the beginning. Janice, who comforted Paola, our most productive crew member, and saved her from certain death. Who comforted myself without having been asked when I actually needed it. Janice: if you read this, I would love to hear your side of all of this. Were you planning for a return to Sol? Because if so, you're the best Mush ever. Because that sort of tactic is truly fiendish: sticking by your crew, being helpful and productive just to see them fly into their own doom. I salute you. The ending screen may show 0 glory, but that has nothing to do with reality. You, m'lady, are truly and utterly Mushy.</p>

But despite that it really seemed like we were going to make it with the serum back to Sol, right up to the point we found out that our Raluca was a bit of a spud. Needing to do 3 expo's in a row for oxygen was pretty killer too.</p><p>Relaying the PILGRED 1% at a time is something I wish I wouldn't have had to do again like my last ship but once again the crew is active but the technicians are no where to be seen. Props to Paola for getting all the comms work done without the sofa, made hunter killing a million times easier in the final days.</p><p>I set myself to bait stance because I thought our illustrious commander Chao was going afk, and I somehow managed to dodge all of the hunters shots or something (never really been a pilot before). But that good feeling got wiped away when I saw the next screen saying i'd been abandoned in space when I had the AP to land <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico">. No hard feelings of course <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>Either way, a good crew held back by bad luck and the wrong crew members being inactive. Probably my best ship so far as I had yet to even get this close to Sol or breach the 10 day mark.</p>

                <p>Yeah, I'm really sorry about abandoning you... I misread you there, I was sure you wanted to go out in a blaze of glory as would have been fitting. I guess I didn't lose too much sleep about the decision though, because there was no way in hell we were going to survive longer than another 2 cycles. With 30+% remaining on Pilgred, less than 10% hull and multiple hunters joining us each cycle, it just wasn't meant to be any more. Not to mention the majestic number of 12 broken things...</p>
