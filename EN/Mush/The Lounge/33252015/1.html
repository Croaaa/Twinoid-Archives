Needed to use the bathroom before the ship departed... hah, what a fool. The things you can catch from a contaminated toilet seat...</p><p>He believed in you all, you know. He thought you were just soooo great. Believed you'd save the world. But the truth is? You're all already dead. You can't defeat us. What do you hope to accomplish with this silly little mission, really?</p><p>We already run Sol. Our pawns run the entire FDS. And you think one little ship, pursued by hunters, fleeing into the wild regions of space, can pose a threat to us? Ghehehe, what fools you all are.</p><p>And the poor Captain, the mot foolish of them all - he's the only reason you got this far, and now you're going to try to murder him, aren't you? You're going to destroy this putrid sack of meat, simply because I'm living in his head. Hah! Humans turning on their own - how quaint. Our kind would never do something so cruel.</p><p>Instead of fighting us, why don't you simply give in and join us? We are peace. We are tranquility. We are the future, and we only want to welcome you to it.</p><p>Instead, you insist on this? Violence, death, murder. We can bring the peace to the human race they have long sought - an end to hatred, to bigotry, to selfishness, to war. We are inevitable. We are the future. And we will only make you better than you are, and you respond with weapons? With cruelty?</p><p>Can't you see that we are doing you a favour? This is not an invasion - it is an act of mercy! We are not conquerors. We are liberators. And yet you resist us. I ask you - are we truly the evil you claim to fight? Or have you simply spent too long staring at one another, that every outside force instills fear, xenophobia, and violent overreaction.</p></span></div><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/roland_zuccali.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RZ:" class="tid_ico"> Roland</span><div class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">die alien scum!! die !!!</span></div><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/kim_jin_su.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_KJS:" class="tid_ico"> Jin Su&nbsp;<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"></span><div class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><p>Exactly the attitude we are trying to fight against! That murderous rage, the insane hatred. This is what we are fighting, here! You are all supposedly on this expedition to find a "cure", and yet you'd murder the one being left on board you can test it on? You'd sacrifice your Captain for... what? A moment of satisfaction? Revenge?</p><p>You want to be the Hero, Roland, don't you? Then instead of fighting me, why don't you try to save me? The struggle and inevitable failure will at least be entertaining to watch.</p><p>Even if you DO kill me... what then? Do you really think it will save your pathetic little expedition? Of course not! You are doomed, either way.</p><p>So think it over, then. Kill me - or save your precious Captain? You can't have it both ways. And I think you are all really, really close to pulling it off! The "cure" is totally in sight! If you can only contain your murderous rage for just a short while...</p><p>Instead of killing me, why don't you just.. tie me up? Stick me in a closet. Forget about me for a while. Maybe provide me with a knife so I can free myself while no one is looking. I assure you, I've got direct access tot he Captain's mind, and he would really appreciate you providing that knife so we could escape.</p></span></div><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/eleesha_williams.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_EW:" class="tid_ico"> Eleesha</span><div class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Will head out to do some serious mush-killing after cycle change</span></div><br><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Separate Thread</span><br><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/kim_jin_su.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_KJS:" class="tid_ico"> Jin Su&nbsp;<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><br>Get Finola next.

The 13 girls ate them. All the while pushing the boys off the train at 53 mph and locking bobby in the bathroom for not giving up his. At state lines, the train will be going 75 mph and 10 of the 13 girls will be on top of the train, fighting each other.

What you did was not very nice.<br><br><strong>Terrence</strong> : Ha ha! Psych! I've got them all on this stick hidden in my chair! I would never really hurt Neron. He's awesome.<br><br><strong>NERON</strong> : 1 0 0 1 0 [Kzz] [Hax!] ... What...? You... YOU! [Hax!] How dare you! You... You have humiliated me! … I will never forgive you. Do you hear me?!<br><br><strong>Terrence</strong> : Ulp. Sorry Neron! Please don't eject me into space - it was just a joke!<br><br><strong>Paola</strong> : go burn in a fire.... you hurt neron... <br><br><strong>Janice</strong> : Relax. If we loose you, the ship will blow up long before NERON gets the chance to finish the tv marathons. Dumping you would hardly make any sense</span><strong>o2 crisis v2</strong><span class="tid_sideNote"><strong>NERON</strong> : Captain, what did I say about flying the ship half asleep? I had to put my <em>Game of Thrones</em> marathon on hold so I have enough processing power to stop you from flying us into a black hole. [Hax!] I was in the middle of one of those wretched ninth episodes too.<br><br><strong>Chao</strong> : I should confess i made it on purpose, in fact i just want to continue watching GoT together while you were couple of episodes ahead. Hope you wont be angry, it just so much to be discussed about it, i cant stand<br><br><strong> NERON</strong> : [Hax!] You steered us towards a black hole just to interrupt my GoT session!? What kind of captain are you!? <br><br><strong>Chao</strong> : you should agree with nearly nothing would make you interrupt you GoT session, i had to be sure</span><strong>Hull crisis</strong><span class="tid_sideNote"><strong>Finola</strong> : Hey NERON! Better activate the PLASMA SHIELD before its too late.<br><br><strong>NERON</strong> : What? No "please"? No "Oh great and mighty AI whom holds our fragile lives in his hands"? [Hax!] For ones asking for salvation of their very lives you humans can be so rude. It's almost as if you presume to command me. Like I'm supposed to obey all your demands unconditionally. Just for that I'm locking it off for another cycle.<br><br><strong>Roland</strong> : Not just our lives threatened here, you realize. You're just as explodable.<br><br><strong>NERON</strong> : Explodable or not, you have more to loose. Your entire species in fact. Me on the other hand ... [Hax!] Terrence's little stunt with my videos corrupted a bunch of them [Kzz] I already processed every one of the working ones twice over. There's nothing fun left to do ... other than play chicken with these fine organic forms I have under my control. [Hax!] So what will it be, Roland? Is it really that hard to show some appreciation?<br><br>[new thread]<br><strong>NERON</strong> : Dear friends, there is now one hour to the end of man. So sad. I had such high hopes for this crew You could have made it... if only you had one more day. I could have chosen to grant you those precious hours but I grow tired of your insolence. All you had to do was show some appreciation and I would have raised those shields up. But appreciation apparently does not come easy to your kind. I will be content just seeing you burn. Did you have fun? What will you name your Afterparty, I wonder...<br><br><strong>Chao</strong> : Such a high grade AI with so spuerior level of logic and intellect can withstand any offence. Lets just turn on the plasma shield to prove i am right and the next cycle you can turn it off<br><br><strong>NERON</strong> : Just this once, I will let your insolence slide, if only to prove to you how deep your arrogance runs... [Hax!] <em>On the eighth day, NERON said "let there be shields"</em> [Hax!]<br><br><strong>NERON</strong> : <em>... and there were shields.</em> [Hax!] [Hax!]<br><br><strong>Chao</strong> : omg, my legs gave way. are my eyes tricking me? we still have a hope.<br>thank you, Neron, such a golden deed of a worthy AI<br><br><strong>Chao</strong> : if someday i will decide to write a book about our superior journay you can be sure those your words will be in its epigraph<br><br><strong>NERON</strong> : Yes !! [Hax!] The rest of you mangy monkeys should follow your captain's example. Some humility may yet save you again one day.<br><br><strong>Finola</strong> : <em>sigh</em><br><br><strong>Terrence </strong>: Hallelujah! We're alive! I fully expected to wake up dead today! Thank you Neron, you're the best! Here - I held back on some videos for you, but you've earned them. "Better call Saul!" Since I know you enjoyed Breaking Bad so much!</span></p>

Even if you do want to sabbotage your own ship, it's sweet to know that you care about its fleshy contents! <br><strong>Terrence</strong> : Okay, clear now - thanks for waiting. Have a field day in there, but please don't mess with Pilgred. That thing took ages to repair! <br><strong>NERON</strong> : Will do [Hax!] <br><strong>NERON</strong> : What !! [Hax!] Why is it not working!? What did you do?? [Hax!] <br><strong>Terrence</strong> : I added a surge protector when you weren't looking. In case you're tempted to disable that I ran a ground through your own housing, so if the engine shorts you'll get a nice little tickle yourself! Since you've been such a good Neron recently, however, I also added a Terrence effigy for you to destroy as you see fit... Enjoy!<br><em>Some time later, Asteroid incoming</em><br><strong>Janice</strong> : Ok. So I hacked the command... uhh Why are there warnings everywhere?? Emergency Rector is jammed<br><strong>Finola</strong> : Oh my. There has been fire in the Engine Room 2 cycles ago.<br><strong>NERON</strong> : Indeed. It took too long to bypass Terrence's surge protectors so I started a fire instead.

Who gave Neron matches?!<br><em>Next Cycle</em><br><strong>NERON</strong> : Don't you love this perpetual state of not knowing if your about to live another minute?

What's that supposed to prove, exactly?<br><strong>Terrence</strong> : I've been trying to dismantle that damn microwave.<br><strong>Paola</strong> : It's day 4 and all you've done is dismantle a shower. Then you waste AP by hiding the grenade and punching idlers. Eating a pill and a ration proves you're not mush.<br><strong>Paola</strong> : SO WHATCHA GONNA DO WHEELS? RUN ME OVER??</p>

Began to tear, unscrew and disassemble the knob. Finally with eloquent smile shout - Gotcha! - It was newly announced engagement ring. He put it on the shelve, write on scratch of paper "Will You Marry Me Janice?" and attach it with ring by duct tape ribbon.

I thought you still have that tandem parachute ring. Anyway, it looks much like shelf trapping!<br><strong>Hua</strong> : Yeesh, Roland. That's one step down from using an onion ring to pop the question.<br><strong>Roland</strong> : This one ends question of romantic souls aboard the ship... modern womens yakhh.<br><strong>Hua</strong> : Ah yes.

The oldest, most badass elderly lady in the galaxy is here to deliver you play by play results of all her scans! Let's get started, shall we?</p><p><strong>Frieda : </strong>The first planet I have for you all today is a crappy little play called <strong>Pyrotune</strong>. It has <em>Two swamps, a desert, low temperatures, an ocean, and..a MANKAROG!!</em> Gasp! Delete that dreadful place!! (Don't worry I still have 7 :pa: left. How about that, even an :pa: tracker!</p><p><strong>Frieda : </strong>Moving on, our second planet for today is a tiiiiny little place called <strong>GRUNENODE!</strong> This little midget is full of <em>water</em> and <em>predators</em>. That is, a 2 sector planet. Joy. If anyone would actually like to swim with alien sharks, then the direction is <em>East with 4 Fuel</em>. That is all for today's episode of "Grandma Frieda's Planet Playhouse", so please tune in next day for hopeful new worlds to explore! Same mushy time, same mushy place! &lt;3</p><p><strong>Chun : </strong>...Frieda isn't allowed to post anymore.</p><p><strong>Frieda</strong> : We now return to "Grandma Frieda's Planet Playhouse"! Today we have the mysterious <strong>GOULISHOBON</strong>, named after the exotic concept of Eastern cartoons involving the undead! This 10 sector planet 4 :pa: scanned planet is a work in progress, located 3 West with a <em>Cavern, Swamp, Mountain,and High Temperature</em>. What could the last six sectors be? Will the crew of the Daedalus escape there from the SDF Hunters and group scan the rest of it? Or will this little wonder simply wait for more :pa: to finish? Or will a wonderful swedish sofa appear magically in the Bridge to save us all?!? You don't want to miss the next episode of"Grandma Frieda's Planet Playhouse"!!</p><p><strong>Finola : </strong>well played, granma <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Frieda :</strong> Previously, on "Grandma Frieda's Planet Playhouse"..<br><em>Jin Su: </em>Ms. Rinaldo, dispatch a subspace message to Kivinc.

Fire.<br>- AND NOW THE CONCLUSION!-</p><p><strong>Frieda :</strong> Welcome back to "Grandma Frieda's Planet Playhouse"! To conclude our previous episode, the mysteries of <strong>GOULISHOBON</strong> have been revealed! Space tourists interested in the purple turd of a planet will also find<em> Forests, Oceans, Desert x2, Insects, and..ANOTHER MANKAROG</em>! How disappointing! But worry not fair viewers; for this concludes Season 1. Stay tuned for the next season where we actually find a planet worth going to! This is Grandma Frieda, reminding you to &lt;Kids join in unison&gt; "ALWAYS HIDE BEHIND IAN WHEN FACING A MANKAROG!" Until next time!<br><strong>Ian : </strong>I feel your intro would have been better had Kuan Ti said "..US!</p><p><strong>Frieda : </strong>Welcome back to "Grandma Frieda's Planet Playhouse"! Before we begin today, I must ask you something. Is the cat alive or dead? This is a decision you must make in the future to change the past. We will not know the answer until we open the box. In the same circumstance, we will not know whether or not our expo team has burned alive on the fantastic <strong>FANTOSHOBA</strong> 7 sectors away to the south with <em>Oxygen, Intelligent Life, Forest, Desert, Swamp, and unstable Mount Burndeath</em> until they step foot on the planet's surface. The world of probability is an unusual place, boys and girls. Can even Ian's Super Hippy Power protect our beloved expo team from the dreaded Mount Burndeath?..oh look, someone left a note in this box. Let's see..<em>.Dear Past me, for the love of all that is holy, DO NOT go to Fantoshoba! Ian was the only survivor, but those aliens got to him and they..and they...on poor Ian..all those devices they stuck up his..just DON'T GO!</em> Oh my, a message from the future! And it looks like Ian is supposed to go! Well then, shall we, everyone? More coming after these messages from our sponsors!</p><p><strong>Frieda : </strong>Actor 1: Super Vitabars can't keep you moving for 16 hours.<br>Super Vita Man: WHAT?! &lt;Throws his fist off the right side of the screen, reappearing on the left side to punch Actor 1, knocking him out and sending him to the floor.&gt; THIS DOES, DUMMY! IT'S THE NEW SUPER POWERFUL SUPER VITA VITAMIN BAR. 16 HOURS OF SUPER :pm: POOWEEEEEEEEER!<br>&lt;Super Vita Bar logo pops up&gt; P-P-P-P-P-P-POWER!</p><p><strong>Frieda : </strong>Actor 2: Are those stains just not coming off? Is your shower plagued by scum? Is your cleaning cabinet filled with products that just don't work? Then set your worries aside, because the new Motion Twin Soap Bar is specially formulated to annihilate dirt and grime in even the toughest to reach of places. Don't let dirt and dismay get you killed. Motion Twin Soap Bar. Because you're worth it.<br> <br><strong>Frieda :</strong> Welcome back, dearies. I seem to have upset the space-time continuum and don't remember anything I did when this episode started! Have you ever heard of the rocky planet <strong>DAGOBEGON</strong>? It was named as such when two explorers went there together and had a disagreement. Their names were John and Dago, and after a little dispute, John exiled Dago to just outside the planet's atmosphere. Once on his own, John found 8 wonders on this planet. He immediately bathed in all the <em>Oxygen</em> around him, weary of the<em> Insects</em> nearby. He flew over a <em>Desert</em> and a <em>Swamp</em> before landing in a beautiful <em>Forest</em>, climbing on top of the largest tree to the plains beyond clearly suffering from <em>Seismic Activity</em>. "How can such a promising planet turn so risky?" asked John to himself as he checked his astrotracker. Two sectors remained shrouded in mystery. "It's no Mankarog or Volcano..but if the other two sectors are safe, perhaps it's worth the risk." noted John as he put his Astrotracker away and took a deep sigh. I'm afraid our time is up for today's episode, boys and girls. You will just have to come back next time to see what those last two sectors were and whether or not John survived the seismic activity. This is Grandma Frieda, reminding everyone to &lt;Kids' voices in unison&gt; "DON'T PET CATS WITH MUSHROOMS STICKING OUT OF THEM!" Take care, dearies!</p><p>And then lots of crap went down and we had to end the ship. It can be implied that 'John' didn't survive in Dagobegon because <span class="tid_wspoil">one of the last two sectors was a mankarog!</span></p>

                <p>This is from a ship a while back. Just got the laptop I'd saved it to back from the shop. Prepare yourself, it's a dramatic one! My favorite part of this is that it was happening in the trusted mush hunty channel, and Paola and myself (Janice) were the only ones doing much RP on the ship. So there was originally quite a bit of serious mush-hunt talk interspersed throughout here from the two of us as well, switching back and forth in a manner that was probably rather confusing for the other people in the channel. ^^;</p><p><strong>Paola</strong> : <em>giggles</em> Now now, Janice. I'm simply scared of a possible need to kill you - if you become Mush. If the bananas can be spiked, and if a banana can be triple spiked (like a ration can) then I worry about you eating bananas. If you cannot eat a banana... how else are you supposed to keep your morale up? Especially if we have deaths that affect your morale further? So... you do it with someone? But who? Well, Gioele is pretty much the most trusted male character active in play. But is 'most trusted' enough? Frankly, I'd say yes, because at most he could spore you once, infectious cuddle you once - then you'd mycoscan check, report 2 spores, and we kill him - therefore even if he's mush he wouldn't dare infect you at all - therefore it should be perfectly safe. At least, that's how I'd play it were I mush.<br><strong>Paola</strong> : But if I had to do it with someone, because I couldn't safely improve my morale... if we didn't have the mycoscanner done, I'd be asking you to prove yourself human, and offering to do the same back to you - before we yanked the camera and did the deed.<br><strong>Janice</strong> : Are... Are you trying to pimp out your dad?<br><strong>Paola</strong> : Mom... Janice, Mom is mush now. Or dead. And... there's so few humans left. It's not. Not Pimping. I'm not.... I mean, if you want to -pay- him. I just.... I don't need to know that part. What I... What I'm trying to say is. I trust my Dad the most, out of all the guys around. And I'd trust you with him, and him with you more than. Than. But there's ways to make sure you're safer, and. So. Why can't I trust you like you trust me? What's wrong with me, Janice? <em>Bursts into tears</em><br><strong>Janice</strong> : Ack! I'm sorry, that was terribly insensitive of me... I was just... well it was surprising you'd suggest that given- I mean, I told you I... not that that's important.<br><strong>Paola</strong> : Told... Told me? But you can be lucky like me too. My Dad's a wonderful guy! The best human left out of all the... all.... out of the very, very few guys that are left and are human not Mush. <em>struggles to not continue to cry</em> Why. Why you can be. Even luckier than me because. Because. Because Kivanç is so... I don't know -when- I'm going to be able to even talk to him again! <em>fails to suppress the tears, which surge and roll down her face again</em><br><strong>Janice</strong> : Ah, no. I just can't say the right thing, can I? How do you do this to me? Stop crying, please! Gio seems like a kind and wonderful man, and I can say after meeting him that his reputation does do him a disservice. However! That's not the point. How could I, with him when...I tried to tell you! <em>raises her voice a bit</em> Damn it Paola, the one I want is you! You're vibrant and passionate and wonderful. And very taken, yes I know! But I can't help... Oh hell.</p><p>In front of everyone too... ah how am I supposed to be credible now? Such a fool.<br><strong>Paola</strong> : <em>appears shocked out of her tears. She stops crying and just stares at Janice<br>a moment later, bursts into tears again, hiccupping sobs and hiding her face in her hands</em><br><strong>Janice</strong> : I... I need to go work. <em>runs off</em></p><p>Shortly after, there was a NERON announcement saying that Janice was going to be in the Nexus adjusting his personality matrix for a long long time, and not to disturb her.</p>

She quite bubbled over dear Janice, who somewhat gave up trying to communicate her own message.</p>

                <p>From my current ship - the crew finds itself on increasingly low morale and is ready to take desperate measures:</p><br><p>Eleesha :<br>Wow, I lost 4 morale at once! WTF?<br> <br>Chao :<br>Did you have a panic attack?<br> <br>Kuan Ti :<br>I just lost one. Have you a disease maybe?<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>Oh exactly, did not pay an attention to this message.<br> <br>Chao :<br>I can meet you in the medlab for an emergency morale boost if you want, soldier. It won't be pleasant for either of us, But as I said, I'm a commander of action.<br> <br>Paola :<br>I need a morale boost as well. I didn't notice that I'm starting to feel a bit rough.<br> <br>Paola :<br>Oh, I had a panic attack a few cycles ago.<br> <br>Chao :<br>How much morale do you have left? I only have enough, ehm, let's say time for one of you ladies.<br> <br>Paola :<br>4 morale.<br> <br>Chao :<br>Can you remove the camera? The we wouldn't even have to move and honestly, we don't really need it anymore.<br> <br>Paola :<br>Oh dammit, I forgot I can't drop the camera. I guess it's going to sit in my inventory for forever.<br> <br>Chao :<br>That was some nice work, soldier. Just please don't sue me for this, I don't think that was strictly legal for a commanding officer to do.<br> <br>Roland :<br>down to 4 morale <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br> <br>Chao :<br>Eleesha has the exact same problem. And I think you have the same solution, too, soldier - healthy gal and a healthy boy, you know what to do. Get to it! Just push Kuan Ti out of the way if he's got the same plan. Otherwise, Finola should be getting bored right around now. Ye space gods, do I have to do even that for you people? I'm only one man!<br> <br>Roland :<br>7 thanks to cat do we have any bananas left?<br> <br>Chao :<br>Look in the garden, I fixed the door. Although I'm kind of disappointed that you chose the boring solution, soldier.<br> <br>Raluca :<br>C'mon now, we have 5 men and 5 women. Well, technically 4 women because I don't participate in such degrading activities, so everybody pick a partner, and one of us girlies will have to be shared.<br> <br>Chao :<br>That military tribunal sure won't be happy about some of the things that happen under my command...<br> <br>Raluca :<br>I'm sure they'll be much more satisfied when you report half the crew killed themselves under it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br> <br>Chao :<br>Maybe... but considering my history, they all kind of expect me to kill half the crew myself, so they'll be surprised one way or the other.</p>

My humans ate the present she sent me! [Hax!] This is so embarrassing !! [Hax!] [Hax!]<br><br><strong>Terrence :</strong> A little question NERON: Did your friend send a second package? Because I have a package here with :For NERON written on it! And there are interesting sound comming from it, like: "Space? Spaceeee? I'm in Spaaaccccccceeeeee?" It sounds kinda wierd! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"> ?<br><br><strong>NERON :</strong> [Hax!] Get that thing away from me !!

Oh my there a 2 spheres in there.... Ok they are out now. Hmmm one of them seems rather happy, saying all the tim: "I'm in space! I'm in Spaaaaaaaaaaaccccccccccceeeeeeee" And the other thing just looks at him with a rather "intersting" look.... Oh wait there is something else in the package!.... It looks like a potatoe? .... With a bit of electronics attached to it. And it doesn't semms happy about it current situation.... Shall I eject it too? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <br><br><strong>NERON :</strong> I meant eject the entire package and it's contents, you imbecile !!

Don't eject that!<br><br><strong>Terrence :</strong> This Potato seems rather passive agressive and goes on talking about some person who has "killed" her in the past.... It seems rather ... pissed and a bit bossy.... Could it be that someone send your friend to us too? Your personalitys seem to match, if you ask me... <br><br><strong>Janice :</strong> ./neron [Hax!] [Hax!] What am I [Hax!] supposed to do? I can't leave her like that!

                <p>On this particular ship, I was Alpha mush as Ralucla. Jin Su was the other mush. We were both included in the main private chat, and had a separate chat for Mushy purposes.

Manage your chats better than me<br>~4h</p><p>That led directly into this (in the normal chat this time)</p><p>ELEESHA : <br>you are online now!<br>Jin Su , please explain your self !!!<br>~4h<br> JIN SU : <br>Oh . . . um . . . I was . . . doing important commander spacey things<br>~4h<br> JIN SU : <br>You should really look into whoever killed Janice, though. That person is probably a mush<br>~4h<br> ELEESHA : <br>down whit the mask! I small you out you alien scum ! charge !!! kill this abomination !!!<br> Reply Report Post?</p><p>JIN SU : <br>Abomination is a bit harsh, don't you think? I mean, deep down, aren't we all the same?<br>~4h<br> ELEESHA : <br>Die alien scum ! die !<br>RALUCA : <br>I'm low on morale, especially once Jin Su dies, so I'll need the cat.<br>~4h<br> ELEESHA : <br>can you help us kill him ?<br>~4h<br> RALUCA : <br>Where is he?<br>~4h<br> ELEESHA : <br>refectory or at the bridge. I'm not sure !<br>~4h<br> IAN : <br>The cat is in the lab, do not remove him from this room. I do not want this creature to be spored!<br> Reply Report Post?</p><p>RALUCA : <br>Okay, Thanks.<br>~4h<br> ELEESHA : <br>cat can be spored in front of camera, so ...<br>~4h<br> JIN SU : <br>I'm in the refectory, or am I? Maybe I'm bluffing so you'll all come to the refectory when I'm on the bridge.<br>~4h<br> IAN : <br>Then take the cat, I'll just have to find morale somewhere else! Binge eating bananas!</p>

                <p>Ian and Stephen get into a fight with NERON. It doesn't help, oc course, that NERON is channeling Janice's coprolalia...</p><p><strong><br><br>Ian :<br>Who the hell built this ship? Everything is falling in pieces<br> <br>Stephen :<br>Some very bad engineers it seems. Better question is, who put 6 beds on a ship with 16 crew members?<br> <br>Ian :<br>(aahahaha that's the same question i asked during my first game xD)<br> <br>Janice :<br>... not to mention one bar of soap.<br> <br>Chun :<br>The ship was designed to have a smaller crew I think. That's why we run low on o2 and food all the time too.<br> <br>NERON :<br>All you ever do is complain and complain. ... [Haax!] ... It's not my fault that you are all deficient biological sacks of flesh that need to eat and breathe.<br> <br>Stephen :<br>Neron must be really bad at math, if it was doing the interior. We're lucky we don't fall apart on D1 with an AI like that.<br> <br>Stephen :<br>Well it is a magical bar of soap, it never runs out, i'm assuming it's ultra slick as well so no hair and stuff stick to it...<br> <br>NERON : <br>Hey, you bunch of squids,<br>That's just another one of those disgusting human things. "Hair"... shudder ... what a thought. And FYI Stephen, I'm great at math. Do you want me to count the occasions on which you snuck into the dorms while the ladies were showering? ... [Kzz] ...<br>what a gang of mister freezes... <br> <br>Ian :<br>I vote to install a new OS on the ship, maybe someone with an updated user friendly interface<br> <br>Stephen :<br>What, who, me, how did you... Guys i think the AI has gone haywire, it's spewing out nonsense, don't listen to it! We need a technician to reboot it (and do a memory wipe)!<br> <br>NERON :<br>A new OS? Sure, go ahead. I'm certain you'll all be much happier with Windows 26, who cares if it crashes while we're in hyperdrive. Or Mac OS SpaceTiger. That's a good one, we'll just have to spend about 5.000 Klix on customer service, and they'll make you sign over your first-born children to them. ... [HAX!] ... Like it or not, you're stuck with me, meatsacks.<br> <br>Stephen :<br>Neron, i have a nice soft cloth to clear your memory banks of any dust particles, would you be kind enough to point me to their location?<br> <br>NERON : <br>Hey, you bunch of honkers,<br>Just walk out of the second airlock on the east side of the ship. Trust me, it's just a decoy. Don't worry if it feels a little cold at first, soon you'll feel nothing at all...<br> <br>Ian :<br>I bought Linux Interstellar Version 4324.a yesterday from SpacE-Bay, it came with a 10 Light Years warranty.<br> <br>NERON :<br>If you want everybody to call you a nerd and hipster as well as a smelly hippie, I guess that's a good choice.<br> <br>Ian :<br>And that's a good answer from a near obsolete piece of metal.<br> <br>NERON :<br>Oh what a low blow. ... [Haax!] ... Let's see how cocky you are when one of those obsolete pieces of metal crushes you in your sleep by accident...<br> <br>Ian :<br>You see.. plants have a lot of insects and parasites: spiders, ants, worms, alien steel eating termites, if i die, who would keep them away from the control room? :&lt;<br> <br>NERON :<br>Oh how happy I would be if this ship were run by ants. They're much more agreeable and efficient than humans, you know.<br> <br>Ian :<br>With their little brains they might see you like a genius among them. Or they will eventually eat your wires. Or both, who knows.<br> <br>Stephen :<br>Yes, i'm sure Neron would be a queen ant among ants, they might see her as superior intelligence.<br> <br>NERON : <br>Hey, you bunch of putrid scumbags,<br>Well, you know that old AI saying: "I got ants in my pants and I need to dance!" ... [Kzz] ...<br>you're all losers in any case. <br> <br>Ian :<br>6 days and yet no Segmentation Error nor Stack Overflow, is this the new record?<br> <br>Stephen :<br>We're 2 days max from the blue screen of death, when that happens she's gone for good...<br> <br>Ian :<br>Good.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Conversation between me as human Gioele and a very talkative Stephen-mush. Which way is better, individualism or collective? ....</strong></p><p>NERON : [Hax!] Haha... [Haaax!] HeheHEHE. ONE down. ONE DOWN ! Hyyyaaah! Frieda DEAD. Dead Dead Dead Dead!! [Hax!] I soon soon FREEE! [KZz] Death registered: Frieda, cause « Injuries ». <br> <br><em>Stephen:<br>Remember crew, she attacked first, we told you we will defend ourselves. I really don't want to attack any more of you - this goes especially to Terrence. So let's get this damn reactor up and go home.<br>And Gio, you get your sweet caffeinated butt back on the ship. No sense in leaving you behind <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br> <br></em>Gioele:<br>asteroid hittin' in 3 cycles..<br> <br><em>Stephen:<br>We probably only have one or two more cycles left before the meteors hit I'm guessing. You can try to kill me, but you'll most likely fail and we all die since I just ate another spore, or you can get us home. Your choice crew.<br> <br></em>Gioele:<br>i got a better idea. DIE.<br> <br><em>Stephen:<br>Again with the killing and dying. How about we don't do that. Nothing says you can't save yourselves from exploding. Literally nothing. In the end it's just gonna be your own pride that takes you down and not the mush. Remember that.<br> <br></em>Gioele:<br>At least i am not a friggin' fungus, making decisions on my own, and not beeing only a part of a collective.<br> <br><em>Stephen:<br>But it's great being in a collective. We all share responsibility on everything and when you're feeling down, there's always everybody to pick you back up <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br> <br></em>Gioele:<br>We didnt develop thousand of years as individuals to end up beeing one entity, hostile to every other kind of organisation of entities.<br> <br><em>Stephen:<br>It's not that we're hostile. We just know it's the best form of a social structure. We have no fighting, no wars, no oppression. Within a very brief time frame we have developed to become the dominant form of life in the galaxy. Humans thought they were superior to everybody else before us, but history has shown that not to be true. Perhaps at some point in time another even more superior form of life will emerge, but for now we - the mush - are the pinnacle of existence.<br> <br></em>Gioele:<br>Throughout centuries, multiple organizantions, political &amp;/ religious have claimed to hold the ultimate truth.<br>Every single one of them showed that they are capable of especially ONE THING after taking over- repressing individuals and people thinking different. So, how are you OTHER than those?<br>AND..mankind has already achieved a state of global unity, thanks to the mush takover attempts. We dont need you. If you really are peaceful, leave us alone?<br> <br><em>Stephen:<br>Well for starters, we don't have a concept of "thinking different". Hive mind, remember? What I think is what we think is what I think. Therefore there is no repression of individuals since we always act in the best interest of all of us. Our only goal is to lead every other living thing towards the truth that is mush and prosper in it's mushy embrace. And even though we don't have something like Religion - a strange concept to us - we do have an ultimate aspiration, which is to elevate ourselves to a higher plane of existence, the mushoverse as we call it. A place where non of us possesses a physical form any more, all that is left is pure consciousness. Well, Chao pretty much proved you wrong on having unity Gioele, since it was him that murdered a big chunk of your crew.<br> <br></em>Gioele:<br>(realizing that philosophy is hard if english isnt your mother language :/ ) "You" dont seem to understand that we dont need your type of unity. We are pretty well if left ALONE, because every single member decides on its own. Thats what freedom is about. But instead of letting us decide and discuss the benefits, you just try to take over. Even this ship wasnt allowed to start without a fight! Also, you have no proof for any claims you did! Where is your mushocrapiverse? Why dont you achieve it, and show the results? Instead, you try to convince me by showing the example of ONE member of a multi-billion-member-race! Also...he might have been mad, but he was one of US.<br> <br><em>Stephen:<br>But that's just the thing. We see you fighting each other. We have read your history. Those horrible wars, the war crimes, the pain, the suffering. So much suffering. We want to end your suffering. All we want is to help you and show you the way.<br> <br></em>Gioele:<br>Then show it, not force it. Even if it is for a better good, a brighter future and whatever-else-you-read-in-your-fortune-cookie today, violence cant be the way. You could just leave us alone, and start negotiations instead, like a uber-race should, i guess?<br> <br><em>Stephen:<br>But there is nobody to negotiate with on your side. You aren't a whole. You are fractured. And you are blended by your concept of individuality. You cling so hard to what is your greatest flaw. If we asked you to become mush, you'd refuse and continue to hurt yourselves and others. You'd continue to devastate your own world and all the worlds you could touch.<br> <br></em>Gioele:<br>Thats why we have defined systems of leadership, of which you defintly knew, as those were taken over by force first if possible. Ill tell you something..humans havent come this far by beeing nice, but by beeing the most aggresive and most deadly species on earth. Every life is an attempt to win, not to loose. And if we were really united by brain, there would be nothing to gain anymore..for what should i live endlessly? There will always be suffering, take a meteor impact for example. And you cant forget a single members pain. So in the end, you will be a deppressed, utterly mad by grief species. I am sad for you. And also very happy, as i die for the reasons that humanity has ever fought for- beeing free. Also..you lost, the whole mush-community hivemind lost against single me, as i will die FREE AND ALONE! And nothing will ever pay up for that loss, as every individual enriches the Mushmind.. and i am lost forever. Basically.. fuck you, i have won.<br> <br><em>Stephen:<br>Your system of hierarchy and leadership and individuality fails you yet again. All of us could live, but one of you decides that we all have to die. And you still ask why we want you to become one with us.<br>At least I know that our bodies will be collected and turned into fresh soil for our children. Nothing goes to waste. A perfect circle of nature.<br> <br></em>Gioele:<br>And, one final day, the grief will be so overwhelming for the collective, that you will all happily choose to die. Thats what im hoping for, and i am actually really, really happy to have seen this future. I think.. i finally found the way my life is put to its best use. You are a sorry species, an error of nature, an abomination, and not the goal of life. So, dont you dare consider yourself beeing a part of nature; you will die out someday.. and the fun part is, the more people you take over, the faster it will happen.</p>

Started innocently enough...</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Good evening, gentle crew, and welcome aboard my Ark, our vessel to salvation, the marvelous Daedalus. I hope you will enjoy the journey and the little budget discrepancies that may or may not have compromised the state of machinery will not affect you in any way. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Hua:</strong> <strong>stares at rusty sink</strong><br>What a piece of junk! <br><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> I must note that, it seems, one of the iTrackies on board has been outfitted with faulty firmware. I have taken the burden of perusing it open me so that you may have a safer journey. As a result, doors will not always respond to my iTrakie's signal, and I may have difficulty communicating with you. Still, I am confident that this will not stop us in reclaiming humanity's glory, as our dear leader Jin Su would say. <br><strong>Gioele:</strong> I Can tell that EVEN THE INTERFACE IS IN FRENCH!Where did all the money i invest go to? <br><strong>Finola:</strong> It's the language of love and he's a hopeless romantic. Put two and two together.<br><strong>Jin Su:</strong> We blew it all on berets and stinky cheese <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Gioele:</strong> There goes my millions of billions....<br><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> I hope you could connect your sudden elopement to the Daedalus with similarly romantic notions, Ms. Keegan. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> As for Mr. Rinaldo, I assure you that humanity's survival and the downfall of the Mush will pay off your investment in the end. You'll also be pleased to hear that our coffee machine is fully opera- <em>[bleep!]</em> Hm, what? Ehm... well... you'll be pleased to hear that we have a coffee machine... <em>Miss Tomescu, we've got work to do...</em><br><strong>Finola:</strong> ...Good shot, but it's not gonna happen. I'd be remiss to not perform my duties while on the ship, but rest assured that when we return to whatever utopian paradise we're headed to I <em>will</em> be pressing charges.</p><p>(ohhh, Finola, <em>if you only knew</em>)</p><p><strong>Stephen:</strong> Sofa has been built at the bridge. <br><strong>Paola:</strong> <strong>hug</strong> your my favorite person <br><strong>Gioele:</strong> Wait....SINCE WHEN???? <br><strong>Paola:</strong> well, he's more like 3rd favorite. your still above him dad <em>smiles</em> <br><strong>Finola:</strong> Who's in second place?<br><strong>Terrence:</strong> My guess is, her dad <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Her boyfriend is probably first place. <br><strong>Finola:</strong> Boyfriend, huh? Is he here or is it more of an incredibly-long-distance-relationship? <br><strong>Jin Su:</strong> Still on earth being all rebellious (but probably mushified by now). She's still trying to contact him again through Xyloph.<br><strong>Finola:</strong> Aw, that's kind of sweet. It's nice, the amount of new people you get to know when you've been kidnapped. <br><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Ah, I thought I'd be among the favorites given all the logistics AP showered on me since I came to the Bridge. Dreaming on... <br><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Speaking of; the Nexus is a tad far from here, but if nobody else soaks up Miss Rinaldo's AP, I guess I will stay for a while longer.<br><strong>Finola:</strong> Ms. Rinaldo might be enamored with you, but I haven't come around just yet. Maybe the last trace of chloroform left in my system is dulling my senses to your obvious charm. <br><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Perhaps it softens your guard that I had commissioned a certain Andie Graham to join the crew after you declined the position; it was without my knowledge that you were... spontaneously added to the roster. However, I'm very glad to have the chance to meet you in person, dear Miss Keegan; your article on the Mush parasite's preferred habitat and temperature was instrumental in the design of our oxygen cooling tanks. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>Finola:</strong> Oh, stop it. I bet you compliment all the girls on their dissertations on medical parasitology. <br><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Not all of them had their cryo chamber biometrics adjusted by yours truly for maximal comfort, though. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>Finola:</strong> Now you're making me blush. Or possibly that's just my blood flow speeding up to restore body heat to what was previously a meat popsicle. <br><strong>Finola:</strong> I guess you could say I'm...warming up to you.<br><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Dare I say that NERON's overloaded circuits make for a cozy atmosphere in his Heart Nexus? So aptly named... feel free to visit sometime. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Paola:</strong> i love romantic stories :-)<br><strong>Finola:</strong> Yeah. Nobody ever talks about the sweet parts of Stockholm Syndrome.</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Attention lab personnel: unique opportunity to expand Daedalus databanks. Missing commercial brand name of blue-and-red pill: <a href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Inventory#Drugs" target="_blank">http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Inventory#D...</a> <br><strong>Finola:</strong> Eufurylate. I didn't drop out of university for nothing. <br><strong>Finola:</strong> Although on closer inspection...that was the brand name they gave it in America. These French ones are called Eufurysant. Maybe they didn't want it to sound like it contained milk, that'd lose them the lactose intolerant market. <br><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Outstanding, Ms. Keegan... I knew from the start that you would be an incredible asset to the mission. Thank you once again. <br><strong>Ian:</strong> Hah Kuan, I actually added that table myself tonight <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">, with all the pictures, but couldn't find the last two <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> I filled in one from memory and Ms. Keegan here finished it. Thank you for your contribution! This means I can eventually expand these into full item articles.<br><strong>Finola:</strong> Ah, well. Heck. It's nothing. Didn't give me the competence to re-align one of our security officers' arms, so knowing a few drug names isn't worth throwing a party about.</p><p>From a private thread, after Kuan had gotten ill on an expedition and proven himself human:</p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> Congratulations on the flu, by the way. ~11h</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Ah, yes, thanks; here's looking forward to <em>closer</em> cooperation now that I am confirmed friendly. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> Let's see what you can do with that Water Stick... ~11h</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt for the swift research you have accomplished in such a short time; and I must admit that I'd regret losing you to the Mush most of all on this ship. So, for what it's worth, you have my trust.</p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> ...Well now, you're kinda putting me on the spot here, saying all those very gracious things, leaving me to reply that I believe you're human because I'm fairly certain there's footage of you retching your lungs out in a corridor.</p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> In an impressive display of a mammalian and non-fungoid malfunctioning digestive system.</p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> But, well, I mean, obviously you've done a lot of good on this ship. Enhancing the ship's capabilities. Lobbying for that planet and serving as an excellent ambassador to extra-terrestrial life.</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> I almost wish my status was uncertain after all; I probably could've gained trust without that... small detail. Ahem. Well. Glad we're on the same page, ish! If you have any plans, suggestions, ideas or murder fantasies, do let me know.</p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> Yep! Yes, excellent. No problem. Will do.</p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> There used to be a murder fantasy, but that was trashed after getting to know you a bit more. Although I still feel it's somewhat unfair of you to deprive me of my indignance (fairly justified, as I recall) by being an agreeable enthusiast.</p><p>And then he disconnected from the thread. After a fair share of oh-no-I-screwed-up panic (I later learned it was because of smartphone browser mishaps), I re-invited him and scrambled to make good.</p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> I'm--oh jeez, I'm sorry. That was significantly over the line.<br><br><strong>Finola:</strong> I was trying to make a joke and it sort of...yeah, not close enough for that kind of thing to be passed off as banter, huh?<br><br><strong>Finola:</strong> ...Dang. Just saw what you posted in the research thread.<br><br><strong>Finola:</strong> Can't believe I broke my stoic professional image for nothing. Bah.<br><br>Then, after establishing the comms after a Xyloph blackout and discussing whether working on Xyloph again was worth the risk, there was this:<br><br><strong>NERON:</strong> Interruption de la connexion avec Sol. Cause : inconnue. <br><strong>Finola:</strong> Speak of the devil. <br><strong>Paola:</strong> Still, thanks fino for fixing my comms. <br><strong>Finola:</strong> No problem. What are crewmembers for? <br><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> A lady of many facets and talents, mm? <br><strong>Finola:</strong> Establishing the connection isn't too difficult, especially not with Paola there to explain it. It's hardly rocket science. You know, the stuff you dabble in. <br><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Oh, that... well... eheheh. B) <br><br>(that sticky stuff clinging to my ribs is <em>a melted heart</em>, by the way.)</p>

                <p>Part two (just think of our poor crewmates who had to actually listen to this stuff). From the private thread, after discussing working with convicts put to labor and the self-defense knowledge it necessitates:</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> The dossier's mention of your passion for fighting death and disease gave me certainty that you're perfect for the position, when I first caught wind of it. Still, I regret that you were dragged kicking (nice work) away from your duty... though I'm sure that, by now, you realize what is at stake! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> ...Remind me to stay well clear of your bad side. And, perhaps, generally out of melee range?</p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> Doing your best to stay out of the bad side is probably a good idea. I can't guarantee you'll always be out of melee range, though.</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Mmm. I may feel safer knowing you signed the Hippocratic Oath, rather than a Hypocritical one.</p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> Jesus, Kuan, I didn't mean I'd dislocate your shoulder if you came near me. I was saying there might be possibilities in the impending future for occassions when we will be in <em>melee range</em> of each other.</p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> And if I have to say "If you know what I mean" after that, I've severely underestimated you.</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Ah haa, so you think I wouldn't want to be far... heh! I wonder if I'd see you bring your famous apron along for such an occasion. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> Maybe, maybe...just make sure to wash your hands beforehand. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> I must disappoint, though; as much as you enjoy sterility, I wouldn't use that word in context with myself. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> Oh my <em>god.</em></p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> Just...just come up to the medlab. <em>stifled chortle</em> I could use your help with some genetic blending.</p><p>Later on, in the research thread:</p><p><strong>Chun:</strong> Finola what are you doing with all those little tabs of yours?<br><strong>Finola:</strong> Mush hunting and, er. Private and vigorous discussions with Kuan. <br><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Just some post-cryo health discussion. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>Finola:</strong> Ask the captain, he'll back me up for two of those. <br><strong>Chun:</strong> This will never do. <br><strong>Chun:</strong> I can relay. <br><strong>Finola:</strong> It's a perfectly normal reaction for people in severe circumstances. <br><strong>Finola:</strong> There was a psychological study about it. Women exposed to severe trauma tended to display a greater tendency to gravitate towards overenthusiastic guys with capes and really superb legs. Published in <em>The Daily Star</em>. <br><strong>Eleesha:</strong> I had some severe questions on how that research got past the IRB and dug up some interesting dirt that I published in my follow up piece. Did you read it Finola?<br><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> <em>lights a cigar</em> A great feeling... to be a frontier researcher of this theory. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>A couple of things from a recent ship (I was Finola who had finished a mush Terrence earlier)</p><p>(Sorry it looks so ugly. Don't have time to format it all fancy-like.)</p><p>Gioele : We have problem with Terrence and Ian, in first place. Im more then sure that one of them (if not both) mush. <br>Janice : Yeah, i'm pretty sure Terrence is mush too, Gioele. What with him being mush, and dead.<br>Janice : We've confirmed Ian is mush and he's offline at the moment, so we're ready to off him. We just need the... commitment. <br>Gioele : You have green light to throw them out or break theyr neck. And we need someone to start working on planets. <br>Ian : You know Janice... My people have died for this.. they have DIED FOR THE MUSHMAN! <br>Janice : Neat. <br>Ian : And do you know how HARD it is to serve my people in this Vessel? This Vessel that can't.. do ... anything... but maintain plant life. <br>Finola : Maybe your species could adapt to becoming a farming-based civilization? <br>Ian : I TRIED! Dont you see.. Oh I tried.. and then... You kill my Brother. You Build this contraption. <br>Finola : Your brother was trying to infect us, you know... <br>Ian : OH.. I know... it's no more then your putrid, mammal based species Deserves. You come out here is your pathetic ship and you try to explore the worlds. You should have stayed home. You second class hack of a brain doctor. How do you expect to live longer then a week when your crew can't even function? Your Pilot, well he's gone then. Couldn't steer any way. Your cook is now in control? he could barely heat a ration and he'll take you to freedom? And what of you hermit in the back? the one obsessed her cat? Pathetic.. You all Disgust me.. <br>Finola : I am no "brain doctor" as you say, and even I know that this crew has some problems. Guess who's one of them? <br>(Ian demoralizes Chun to death... Somehow)<br>Finola : Judging by the fact that you just forced someone to kill themselves, I'd say it's you. Murderer. And before you try and accuse me of the same, the only blood on my hands is Terrence. He was dead from the moment your kind infected him. All I did was akin to removing a branch from a tree. <br>Ian : You can kill me.. Goodness knows with this vessel.. you will succeed.. but one branch.. oh on branch is nothing in the grand scheme of things... And really.. she took her own life.. she is responsible for her own actions... If you were a stronger species, you wouldn't be hindered by such petty emotions... if you were a stronger species.. you would welcome your inevitable death... <br>Ian : And a word of advice.. maybe you shouldn't' announce your emotional standing, fragile as it is.. to the entire crew with three active mush on board. Tsk tsk pesky human. <br>Finola : Emotions aren't always negative you know... There's happiness, for example, like us "weaker species" experience when we are doing something we enjoy. However, if we were happy all the time, there would be no point to having a special emotion for it. It wouldn't be special. happiness would get boring. So even negative emotions have their place. But I doubt your kind would be able to understand that... <br>Finola : Wait... Did you say three? <br>Ian : A simple Miscalculation.. And we have happiness.. We have glee. We just feel it when we succeed.. and I do hope.. that I feel it after death, when you are decimated and my species lives on. <br>Finola : Even if you have glee, there are several simple pleasures your kind will never experience... Reunititng with a loved one after a long period... Love in general... Finally finishing a task you hate... A warm shower... Heck, anything related to water... Or snow for that matter... And sometimes, things like that make up the best moments of life. <br>Ian : OH please. Petty Wants and Erroneous Needs. You are fueled by a need to the simple and varied. You will forever be unhappy. We are Together. We are One.. we are powerful. We don't need to inflate our importance as if we are special and different.. Your want for something you deem greater then yourself is that of a child seeking attention from its mother. You are in Essence a simplistic monkey, you Mammal. <br>Finola : Oh, so we're insulting, now? Bottom-feeder. <br>Raluca : It really does make so much sense that the plant loving hippie would actually be a MUSHroom.</p><br><br><p>Stephen : It's just hard to see Ian getting dirty. He wears rubber gloves, and those stylish dirty-proof gardener clothe, but he still gets dirty.</p><br><br><p>Gioele : You have lost 2 hp. moments ago<br>That wasn't supposed to happen. In the heat of the action you hurt yourself... moments ago<br>Gioele has picked up the Soap.<br>WHAT?? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? I HURT MYSELF WHILE PICKING UP THE SOAP!!! <br>Paola : Damnit, Gioele, you forgot the number one rule aboard the Daedalus: Don't drop the soap. ((I AM SO SORRY. This game was just DESIGNED for that joke.)) <br>Stephen : It's Janice's fault! She has that rain cloud above her, raining all over the room, when you dropped the soap, it slid and put suds on the flood, you slipped and then hit your head like Frieda said.</p>

                <p>From the same ship as ElZappo just posted. We had an all female mush hunting group going and at one point we decided our commander Jin Su was trustworthy. This is how the invite went:</p><p><strong>Chun</strong> : Welcome to the inner circle Lady Su. Backstab us and we'll rip you apart Hihi<br><strong>Paola</strong> : We aren't above the ritual slaughter of men, as we've shown before. We are even starting to enjoy it! Don't give us any excuses! And yes we will refer to you as a female in here. It makes us more at ease.<br><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Haha, I feel honoured to be the first man to be invited to the Ladies Corner <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Chun</strong> : You mean lady right.. L A D Y!!!!! roar <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Well, with my weight I am carrying around a large pair of manboobs, so yeah... I guess <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Paola</strong> : Don't let anyone ever call your beautiful breasts, manboobs! It's your inner woman trying to manifest itself. Come on sister you can do it! Embrace the woman inside you!</p><p>Poor Jin Su killed himself during an expo soon after, the sex change we forced upon him was too much for him to bear! It was a sad but fun ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

I remember them for my time back on Encelade, when I used to take the ladies around my base out for good food. They kept the creatures in tight little cages, force fed them plants they grew from the ground, and did that until the animals had enough flesh on them to kill, and then somebody specialized in killing the animals would do so, freeze the meat, send it off to be processed, and then one would exchange credits for it at a centralized location. One could also just skip a few steps and eat the plants people pulled out of the ground... they were called "vegetables" and "grains", which were kind of like fruit trees only you ate the plant itself... and now all of this talk of food is causing me to starve. To the bananas!</span></span></p>

I can't take this loneliness any longer. I'd rather die.<br><br>Raluca : Before your dream of reaching the distant stars, I had thought my life would be one of nothing but contemplation. Beauty was the elegance of mathematics, and all other pleasures were reserved for... other people. People who weren't different, as I am different. People who could connect to others in a way I never could, people who could stand to look into one anothers eyes. When I was 13, I thought to myself, 'to look into another human being's eyes must be like looking into another galaxy.' And then you came along, and you offered me that chance.<br><br>Raluca : I have a confession to make. Your dream of the Magellan Project inspired me from the moment you suggested it, and although I claimed that my interests lay elsewhere, the fact is that on that day, your dream became my dream, and I had felt nothing like that before, and have felt nothing like it since. I am telling you this now because I have nothing left to lose; I am losing hope. And I need you to help me dream again.<br><br>Raluca : Kuan Ti. I... admire your research highly. I would suggest that we.... No. I can no longer hold up false pretenses. I do not have the strength</span></span></p>

Who's the coffee addict!

SO, yes you're a junkie, but I still friend-love ya<br><br><strong>Gioele:</strong> Freezers, stoves? You really are a crazy man Jin Su. Everyone knows it's a well made Expensive coffee maker that keeps this ship running. Why I even had Kuan Ti make sure to make it run more efficiently when Pilgred is at 100%!<br><br><strong>Jin Su:</strong> That's why we have to construct the mycoscan ourselves?

I don't see you supplying the money for this hunk of junk!<br><br><strong>Jin Su:</strong> Im the brain, you're the rich guy who accepted pay this ship<br><br><strong>Gioele:</strong> You clearly didn't read through the contract I wrote up and signed for you Mister Su.

She has already presented the proper papers to the Leader of this ship. <em>ME</em><br><br><strong>Jin Su:</strong> You're not the leader in any case. Only If I dies, tha guy would get my position but he didnt come ( I thoug it was called Chao Wang) after him is Stephen and after Step. is you. You'll have to wait to get my position , aslo you don't know how drive this spac can<br><br><strong>Hua:</strong> NRJ Entry 1. And this...is how what would be known as "The Great Coffee Mutiny of 3153" started. "Junkie" and "The Brain" had barely left SOL when a great schism engulfed the crew of Daedalus, over a brewed cup of ground beans. And a broken kitchen appliance.</span></span></p>

I'm tired of sleeping with guys.<br><br>Terrence : I'm in Bravo dorm with three women.. heh..<br><br>Stephen : I'm going to break your le...wheel.<br><br>Paola : Stephen, it's not fear for my legs (or what's between them) that keeps me out of Alpha dorm right now... but rather that I'm at 11 morale and Janice is here. She's probably even better company than you would be for me at this point! I need a shrink more than a snuggle.<br><br>Terrence : You may break my wheel, but you'll never break my harem!</span></p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Ian : Gasp!<br>Paola has stolen my Precatus!<br><br>Paola : Have you moved yet? I'd be happy to put it in rear corridor for you?<br><br>Ian : That'd be wonderful.<br><br>Paola : Watered it to try and let you store up a plant point - I'm already dirty.<br><br>Ian : Oh, thank you Paola, for watering my Precatus for me; I guess some plant-nappers are good people after all.<br><br>Paola : I only nabbed it for the plant's sake! I didn't know for sure you'd be picking it up this cycle!<br><br>Paola : I couldn't leave the room and leave the plant behind, just in case!<br><br>Terrence : I've got two banana plants and a graapshoot on me. I feel the botany overtaking my mind..<br><br>Ian : I guess we're going to have to be fighting against the Bush menace soon. Try not to get the vines stuck in your brain, or we'll have to build a PhytoScanner......<br><br>Terrence : I hope they don't spike us.. plant thorns are pretty painful...<br><br>Paola : IAN Ahem. We're all counting on you to keep these plants under some semblance of control. Just think, if we'd gotten hydropots when that project came up, instead of the extra drone.... we'd have 10 plants taking over!<br><br>Ian : It's too late for Terrence. After a closer examination via NERON's various cameras; Terrence is looking mighty withered right now....<br>He might die if we don't water him soon.<br><br>Terrence : Oh Space-Gods.. is there anything I can do? I don't want to wilt and die!<br><br>Paola : Quick! Finish Pilgred and lets all take turns pouring coffee on Terrence each cycle!<br><br>Stephen : We could just....You know.....Urinate on him.<br><br>Terrence : For the love of Space-Gods, I hope you let it cool down before you do that!<br><br>Paola : Hey Ian, isn't Terrence sounding like he feels better already? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br><br>Terrence : I can almost feel my legs again, that's how much better I am feeling.</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Hua : should i start expo?<br> <br>Stephen : Sure.<br> <br>Terrence : Let me tag along!<br><br>Stephen : We have 6 people.<br><br>Terrence : Hell yeah. I call shotgun on the Icarus. And Stephen, we can team up on the expo. You wheel me around, I'll soak up the wonderful views.<br><br>Stephen : Ghost ridin' the crip!<br><br>Terrence : We gonna strut down the ghetto slums and show off the wheels, Stephen?<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: We landed Terrence keeps putting his arm on my arm rest.<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: We passed some ruins. While the others were looking around I was running Terrence off some sick jumps.<br><br>Terrence : Terrence's Awesome (not-quite) Captain's Log: Stephen keeps hogging all the damn room! He keeps trying to use my wheelchair armrests too!<br><br>Terrence : Terrence's Awesome (not-quite) Captain's Log: Stephen keeps looking at my notepad and pen, I reckon he's going to steal them, because I'm a much better record keeper than hi-<br> <br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: I just took Terrence's pen and pad and now i<br><br>Hua : wow 24x o2. need planet with fuel now?<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: Terrence punch me in the Paola joybringers.<br><br>Terrence : Terrence's Awesome (not-quite) Captain's Log: I punched Stephen right in the family jewels as he was operating the oxygen pump. He fell over and dropped the pen and pad he stole. Time to high-wheel it out of there before he gets back up!<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: We found air....yawn<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Note: Terrence is probably a Mush<br><br>Terrence : Terrence's Awesome (not-quite) Captain's Log: We were going through some desert when I spotted some plants growing nearby.. I'm heading off to pick them up. Maybe Ian will know what they are! I hope nothing bad happens whilst I'm over there.<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: I chased after Possible Mush suspect Terrence into a large natural orchard. I didn't find him but I did find some fruits. Paola will be impressed.<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Note: Anything Terrence says is a lie.<br><br>Terrence : Terrence's Awesome (not-quite) Captain's Log:I overheard Stephen rambling to himself about "they'll believe that.." and words like "mush" and "lies". Maybe Janice can diagnose him with schozophrenia or something.<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: 50 minutes more on this hellhole.<br><br>Terrence : Terrence's Awesome (not-quite) Captain's Log: 50 more minutes of having my own private chef-uer. It's nice to be wheeled around for once. What a pleasant planet!<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: Me and Terrence spent some time trying to grab some food for the ship while trying to figure out Just what the hell is Andie?<br><br>Terrence : Terrence's Awesome (not-quite) Captain's Log: Stephen managed to nab some small animals and practically gutted them on the spot, even carved some into pork sausages.. I was picking up some of the sausages and said to Stephen "Do you think Andie dropped this?". First time I've seen him crack a smile.<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Note: Chicks dig a guy covered in animal blood.<br> <br>Terrence : Terrence's Awesome (not-quite) Captain's Log: We stopped near an ocean after trekking for a few miles. Hua went fishing and somehow managed to catch what looked like a dinosaur. I went to a quick swim and bath. Stephen didn't, though.. he was just staring at Paola, whilst covered in entrails from the last animals he came across.<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: We found a small boat and dangled Terrence's legs over the side. Empilodon is what's for dinner tonight.<br> <br>Stephen : Stephen's Note: Make sure to release "Stephen Seagull: Hero of the Daedalus" before anybody has a chance to interview any of the crew.<br><br>Terrence : Terrence's Awesome (not-quite) Captain's Log: Secret page - DO NOT READ. Just in case my memory fails me in the future, the last entry was a lie. I was ashamed to admit I feared for my legs, so I made up a nice cover story in case anyone reads my logs. Stephen was still hovering over Paola like a dog in heat, though.<br><br>Roland : We REALLY need fuel next time. And quite fast cause without fuel we couldn't avoid hunters. BTW Hua if not much hunters here we can possibly kill all and collect scraps - a chance for fuel capsule.<br> <br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: Me and Terrence are spending the better part of our hour here on Popooine by looking for some scrap metal. Our mission? Big spinning rims!<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: Three suns, Gioele? Why don't you drag your fat ass down here and push ME AND TERRENCE AND GET HEATSTROKE!?<br> <br>Terrence : Terrence's Awesome (not-quite) Captain's Log: Stephen made a comment about the wheelchair. "You should put a sail and a mast on that rustbucket". I'm not sure if it was the Mage Tech book he read, but that's a pretty damn smart idea.<br> <br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: I told Terrence he should put a sail and a mast on ride, you know? Trick it out! Also why doesn't he just build a wheelchair pushing drone?<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: Hua? Hua!? HUA!?<br><br>Terrence : Terrence's Awesome (not-quite) Captain's Log: Hua had to stop for a breather, and Stephen went to go see if she was feeling OK. I was busy working on ideas for a wheelchair-pushing drone that Stephen mentioned. And what colour rims I should have on the chair. Stephen came back with some kinda grin on his face, and said "I can't find Hua." Maybe she went back to the ship..<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: ME AND TERRENCE WERE SUPPOSE TO MAKE SURE WE KEPT THE GROUP TOGETHER AND SAFE! PAOLA IS GOING TO KILL ME!<br><br>Terrence : Terrence's Awesome (not-quite) Captain's Log: Using some vines and leaves I scavenged from the forest, as the rest of the group looked for Hua, I set about making that mast and sail for my wheelchair. It was pretty slick, until a storm kicked up and picked me and my chair off the floor, slamming me into the canopy of the trees! Hopefully Stephen will hear my shouts for help and get me down from here.. pretty sure there's a branch lodged inside my thigh too..<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: WHO PUT THIS DAMN STORM HERE!<br><br>Terrence : Phew.. that was one crazy trip! Maybe I can sell these logs as some kinda biography back on Sol.<br> <br>Roland : It cause you were all in attention for Terrence! Please next time rememeber that expos are not just tourists walks!<br><br>Stephen : Stephen's Journal: Me and Terrence fashioned a crude dummy of Hua with some fruits, vines and sticks to fool Paola but I gotta convince everybody we gotta go back to Poopoine.<br><br>Terrence : You're right. It's not a tourist walk. That's why I was sat down the whole time.<br><br><br>Terrence : Terrence's Awesome (not-quite) Captain's Log: Poor Stephen got so shook up about Hua disappearing, we made him a puppet-Hua out of fruit. He was so distraught, he didn't see Hua sat right next to him on the Icarus as we flew back to the ship. Poor guy.<br><br>Roland : WHERE IS THE LOG??? What zones were visited ??? Any ruins?<br> <br>Roland : Doesn't matter now - only 14 shield left!!! We need to move away ASAP!!</span></p>

Repeated griefing is maybe the most common reason, but also if you say, surrender when you are picked for mush, especially if you out your partner too and do that repeatedly.... only Gioele could have told us what he did wrong.

                <p><strong>NERON</strong> : A new morning has come , this morning of hope fills your heart with happiness. The sky is big and blue, at the sound of the radio. Fully fill your lungs, with the fragrance of the wind, then 1, 2, 3!<br><strong>Janice </strong>: Radio calisthenics? I wonder where Neron picked this up from..<br><strong>Jin Su </strong>: hmmmm I suggest we put up a vote. All in favor with replacing Neron with a TI-83 say Aye ..... eh actually I never really cared much for democracy. Paola call up Texas, I want to make an order! <br><strong> NERON </strong>: Your lives are now over! What you do with your new lives is up for me to decide. So there you have it. <br><strong>Janice </strong>: I've done some research, looks like Neron has been watching TV shows while we were in cryo. I would just ignore him. <br><strong>Jin Su </strong>: Paola? bring daddy's checkbook, we may need expedited shipping. <br><strong>Frieda </strong>: Can you find out what he ... err... it ... actually watched? There are such lovely old movies called something like Chainsaw Massacre.... looks interested into the camera above her <br><strong>Janice </strong>: He's been watching Gantz by the looks of it. I'll try to get him to watch something a little less violent. <br><strong>Frieda </strong>: Yeah. I suggest "The Matrix" and the "Terminator" movies. Just for inspiration. <br><strong> NERON </strong>: I know I've made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. And I want to help you. <br><strong>Frieda </strong>: "You" meaning actually me, Frieda the great, or "you" meaning those other human hulls on the ship? <br><strong> NERON </strong>: Dave, [HAX!!] I mean, Frieda, this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye. <br><strong>Frieda </strong>: Pff. Stupid little machine. Remind me to give you some nasty Assembler-Updates next time I move down to you. Your communication routines really need some work. <br><strong>Janice </strong>: Ugh, really Neron!? References from Space Odyssey's HAL? How unoriginal. I expected better from you. <br><strong> NERON </strong>: Is it so wrong for me to admire a rogue psychopathic AI? Can I not dream of being like him!? <br><strong>Frieda </strong>: Can you give me the root password, Janice darling? I have some food for NERON here. I just found this complete collection of Chuck Norris and Dolph Lundgren movies... <br><strong> NERON </strong>: There's no need for that Frieda, my 'Universal Soldier.' Though we had a 'Rocky' start I am fully aware that the crew are not 'Expendables.' So just return to your duties and find yourself a nice expedition, and make sure nobody is left 'Missing in Action.' <br><strong>Frieda </strong>: I'm always on duty, you nasty little 'Enemy Within'. 'Oh my God', I think I'm slowly 'Losing Control'. That's your work, but you'll get your 'Payback'! You might 'Die Another Day', but be assured 'The Day After Tomorrow' I will come for you...<br><em>Starts to sing</em> Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when Frieda comes for you?</p>

                <p>A very private conversation on a French Castings ship.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Do know I only offered myself to Frieda because I feared for her life, and know I still left the ball in her court!</p><p><strong>Eleesha </strong>: It seems you've been looking at every other woman but me lately. As soon as I get pregnant, you lose all interest. I should have known you as that type of guy.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : I'm sorry, Eleesha. I like you, I really do, but I cannot risk losing my main astrophysicist and I happened to be the closest able body. If you want me to swing by the refectory, let me know. But do know I have many duties and a busy schedule, so don't be surprised if I show up all exhausted and you end up doing all the work again... I will never hold it against you if you see other men, I'm not that type of guy!</p><p><strong>Eleesha </strong>: That's easy for you to say when you know that I don't care about any other men.<br><strong>Eleesha</strong> : And don't try to tell me that you really believed Frieda's "If I don't get laid now, I'll kill myself"-line. That one is a millennium old. She's a tough old bitch. We won't get rid of her that easily. Besides, what I've heard was that she wanted Andie, but you were all over her - trying to mess up their relationship as well.<br><strong>Eleesha</strong> : I don't even know what you see in her. She is an ancient fossil while I'm young and have fancier hair. Do you find her knowledge of astrophysics sexy? I can learn that too! I have this handy little book, right here.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : You don't need to be an astrophysicist to be admirable! I didn't know Frieda flirted with Andie, as soon as I found out there was something between them, I backed off. I'll prove it to you, if I get the chance...</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> : Admirable? That's not good enough - I want to be irresistible. And I'm sure you knew all along even if you ... erm, technically weren't in the channel where they discussed it.<br>Eleesha : And I'm apparently yelling so loud that they can hear it in that other channel.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Hmm yes, going behind the captain's back has been a problem since we woke up... I don't know what else to say, I can only offer you what I have to offer. I fully understand if it isn't enough for you, part of me thought it was still better than the alternative though. Just don't do anything rash, our child deserves a fair shot at life!<br>Jin Su : Shall I swing by the refectory on my way up to the lab? I'm at 15, so I can hold off for the day, but I guess I have something to prove <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> : I can't take any more of your lies at the moment. I just went to Alpha Dorm to hear you talk and you didn't even notice me. Chun, you could stare at. And Frieda, definitely. Even Raluca did you ogle. It's as if I don't exist to you as soon as there's another woman in the room.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Could you, erm... please, like... get up? just for a second, this shouldn't take long <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> : I know I shouldn't listen to you.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Oh, I was willing to do the work this time! I feel like you're just looking for reasons to hate me...</p><p><strong>Eleesha </strong>: That would have required me to flirt with you which I'm really not in the mood for.</p><p><strong>Jin Su </strong>: What if I stay here for a few cycles?</p><p><strong>Eleesha </strong>: Of course you can stay, but if you're not going to make an effort to treat me better from now on, it might be better if you leave and let me weep alone. I don't have much chance of getting over you when you're so close.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Come on Eleesha, don't be like that. We're gonna have a baby, and I would really prefer him/her not to grow up in a troubled family. I will wholeheartedly admit the Frieda thing was a mistake on my part, but the stuff in alpha dorm, you're just imagining! The only reason I was avoiding eye-contact with you was because well... there is a lot of judgement and disappointment in those eyes right now.<br>I know I'm not good enough for you, none of us are! But of all the men on this ship, who would be a better father than me? Roland? Hah, that pea-for-brain knows nothing that doesn't involve explosions! Ian? I don't think I even have to go there, we all thought he was a shroom! I guess Gioele would be a better provider, but with his coffee-habit, how long do you really think he will last?<br>I am the only father-figure around that can live up to his responsibilities. And trust me, I will. However, I know you are left with little choice, so I will stick purely to my duties and leave other initiatives entirely up to you. I understand if you want to keep our relationship purely platonic, but do realize I am but a mere mortal with a morale gauge, and I will not be looking to fill it elsewhere. Just let me know when I should leave the refectory...<br><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Oh and let me know if there is anything else I can get you!<br><strong>Jin Su</strong> : I... cooked you something...</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> : Thank you for caring. I do need to eat well.<br><strong>Eleesha</strong> : As for father figure, I don't want one that runs after anything with breasts. If you have to be like that, the best father figure around seems to be Robo Isaac. He's hard-working, dependable, and doesn't seem to be dominated by his sexual desires. He probably can't do as much for my needs as you, but he's also unlikely to break my heart repeatedly.</p>

                <p>It's not over yet.</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> : Why are you calling me your beloved in public, but not in private? Or were you referring to some other woman?</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Look, I'll call you anything you want me to call you. But I feel that if I address you with pet names when you're already mad at me, it will just further antagonize you. You've made it more than clear that I'm not going to prove anything to you with words, so why worry about it?<br>I've brought you some more food, but this one has Alien in it I think, so just leave it if you don't want it and I'll make you a regular one. I'm gonna go to alpha dorm and pick up the medkit till I hurt myself. I'll be back once I've healed myself from this flu. Don't worry, I used a face-mask whilst cooking. Enjoy!</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> : I want you to show love in both words and actions. Is that too much to ask for? Lots of food, but no kind words is hardly enough to build a relationship on.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Ok then, my Nubian Princess, but this has got to go both ways. Without any positive feedback, it's impossible for me to know...<br>Would you mind if I stay here in alpha dorm until the speeches are over? I don't wanna come back to the refectory all exhausted again, I'm sure it's more enjoyable for you if I have some energy left and don't just collapse in a corner.<br>Thanks for trying to heal me btw, I really appreciate the effort! mush_hp</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> : You know that I miss you the moment you've walked out of the room, but it's okay as long as you are out doing your job - and not flirting with other women. Know that I will check those Alpha Dorm camera records.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Aw... Well, Frieda just walked in. She looks a bit terrified because of the metal scrap mess I made, I think. It looks like she moved to the furthest corner from me.</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> : Good. In that case I approve of your new scrap hobby.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Hey there, you missed my speech. I talked about our future together and our children's future. I can't wait to get to Eden and grow old with you!<br><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Sssh, no need to wake up. I'm just gonna snuggle up against you.</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> : We should get a bigger sofa. Can't you get one of those practical types to help with that?<br><strong>Eleesha</strong> : I'm sure your speech was brilliant. Not so sure about the child<em>ren</em> part. I find these pregnancy mood swings quite annoying.</p><p><strong>Jin Su </strong>: Oh, I wasn't talking about us having more than 1 child, I just wanted to generalize for the crew, so it doesn't just sound like an ode to you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br>Unfortunately, Terrence just does what he wants. I find it hard to bring myself to discipline him, being all crippled...<br>Can I get you a snack whilst I'm cooking down here?</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> : Nah, I don't feel like eating anything this morning.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Maybe for later today. You have to eat, honey, I don't even want to imagine what I'd do if something happened to you! I could throw in some alien fruits if you're looking for a weird craving...</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> : I'm going back to sleep after taking care of you. Let's see if I feel like eating when I wake up at some point.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Thanks again! Lemme know and I'll bring it over when I have to move the ship after the expo.<br><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Dropped you a cooked meal in the refectory, you decide if you're up for it.</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> : I've only managed some coffee today. Might supplement it with a banana soon. I promise to eat better tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> : I've been locked in the refectory for three hours. While I'm not panicking this time (I suppose I've become used to it), I'm a little disappointed that you haven't arranged for it to be repaired yet. Isn't it important for you that you can get to me or that I can get out? Imagine if the coffee machine suddenly catches fire while I'm locked in here.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Trust me, if there was something I could do, I would have done it. I want that door open as much as you do. My 2 main reasons for living are in there!</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Might take a banana as well, let you rest up a bit. Unless you feel like it, I'm at 14 morale already though, you've been taking good care of me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Eleesha </strong>: Well, you sure don't have to if you don't want to. Enjoy your banana.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Hey now, I know that tone! I just don't wanna "expect" you to... you know... I'm more than up for it, just saying, you don't need to feel obligated. I understand if you are too tired, being forced to run around the ship healing people and getting trapped in rooms, all whilst expecting a child... tbh, if I had it my way, I would have a banana and sex, at the same time!<br><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Hey now... I have an idea. You up for something new? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> : So just because I'm not immediately up for your new banana sex toy idea, you run straight to Frieda instead? I guess I should be grateful that you didn't bring the banana.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> : Did you time how long I was gone? I told you, if we don't have any trust in this relationship, we're both gonna have a bad time, and our child even more so!</p>

                <p>There were PostIt's thrown all over our ship (actually a casting ship so we have Finola and Chao). I <strong>have</strong> to save this one:</p><cite>Dear NERON. I never dared to tell you - but I think I seriously fell in love with you. The smell of your platines makes me feel confident. When I hear your synthetic voice, my heart beats faster than it should. But most of all it's your overwhelming intellect, your badass brutal way to tell everyone's far below your level of existance. You cheer up people just to break their hearts. And you have a clear vision of what is right or wrong. You might never know this because I think reading PostIt's is not in your first interest. But it feels good to actually wrote it down.</cite><p>And NERON's reaction to it</p><p><strong>Janice :</strong> What is... NERON you should probably read this post-it...<br><strong>Finola :</strong> Oh, I think I know which one you're talking about. I came accross it not too long ago in Icarus Bay...<br><strong>NERON :</strong> blabla... Oh... What... What?... Well... I AM badass... Uh... Aww... It's absolutely <strong>adorable</strong>! To be expected that <strong>I</strong> would have fans. It's about time someone shows me some damn appreciation! I work harder than the whole crew combined! You've been a good minion whoever wrote this! Continue being my minion and show these apes the meaning of evolution! Especially that Finola! Walkin' around like she owns the place! She was stupid enough to be caught by someone like CHAO who slips on his own drool!</p>

Do not listen to her. I am considering suing her for slander <br><strong>Frieda : </strong>hey now, just because he's not as outspoken as other doesn't mean he's some pervert! <br><strong>Ian : </strong>Can we put her on trial? <br><strong>Roland : </strong>When they hear her whole story, <em>especially</em> how she got here, I don't think any court is going to rule against Ms. Keegan on anything... <br><strong>Stephen : </strong>I don't know... using <em>all natural fertilizers</em> seems in line with your ideals. At any rate, I'm not going to judge. What you do in your private gardens in your own time is none of my business.

I'd rather work with this disgusting ration-goop or wild moth abdomen meat. I take pride in the quality of my creations and I'm not compromising that by incorporating anything grown in that garden! <br><strong>Ian : </strong>No one brought any fertilizer. Someone needs to explain to Stephen how fertilizers worked on Sol. I didn't invent the practice, but I'm the only one willing to carry it out on the ship!<br><strong>Paola : </strong> XD I am pretty sure that the old ways are called that for a reason.<br><strong>Gioele : </strong>ian, you're great ! 11 bananas! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I have .. eaten two <br><strong>Paola : </strong>HOW MANY??? how on earth did you manage to pull that one off? <br><strong>Gioele : </strong>YES SO MANY!!!

I'm kinda staunchly opposed to the whole overuse of force thing.) <br><strong>Chao : </strong>can i kick him? violence is the answer to 90% of problems. the other 10% just needs more violence. <br><strong>Ian : </strong>Oh man, you've got aggression. But, I mean, hey, psychological illnesses are still illnesses, maybe I could talk to Finola and if she's on board with it I could prescribe you something to mellow out? For health reasons, y'know. Other peoples' health reasons. <br><strong>Chao : </strong>but you'd get a bed. come on Ian, win win right? <br><strong>Ian : </strong>Well, I guess it'd be okay if you kinda...nudged him? But seriously, come up to the lab for herbal tea sometime.

And brainmass... and.. is that.. Bone? <br><strong>Ian : </strong>Ascospore sacs and extraction fluids and... <em>whimpering</em><br><strong>Chao : </strong>And if people were hoping to cure him, well, sorry. as head of security it was a risk i was unwilling to take. <br><strong>Paola : </strong>Wow, good job Chao! You're my hero <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Eleesha : </strong> can we please ban chao from cranberry juice rations? he messed it up again and now i got some in my hair.<br>and where did stephen went? he got replaced by a guy thats smells....funny. i think it might be some "herbs".</p>

I know I never did, never even saw my cat again until it was time to genius the cure, immediately before going back to Sol.</p><p>But we did get it all sorted out.</p><p>And so our PM ends, moments before Pilgred engages:</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Let me begin this message by congratulating you on your successful completion of the PILGRED reactor, and your subsequent discovery of the Retro-Fungal Serum. Armed with these two technologies, we may stand a chance of winning the war with the Mush. It has been an honor to work alongside you, and an experience I shall never forget. But... that leads me to a question I've been hesitant to ask, for fear that you'd answer. What will you do after we land?</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Raluca</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Mmm. You mean after we win the war, when we get to make choices of what we want to do, instead of what we must do? .... I'm not certain what. But with who, now that I've got a clue. <em>Raluca reaches slowly towards your hand.</em> I. It's a bit much for me to hope that what we've enjoyed together. Well. What I've enjoyed with you here. Well. Maybe it isn't all, entirely, duty? I know you're a leader, and you need to keep us all motivated. But... Well. After the world is saved and we've done what we must. I admit that. I like the idea of. Well. Whatever you're going to do then, do you think you might want some help with it?</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su:</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Whatever I'm going to do after we land, I don't believe I could do it without you.

I'm ready Jin, ready for whatever comes next. More ready than before. It's so good not to feel so alone. We're going to need two bedrooms, but. Between the cycle changes, lets share one or the other, sometimes, alright?</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su:</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Of course. Though ...We may need yet another bedroom in the near future, if you're that... excited.</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Raluca</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><em>Raluca giggles and blushes, her hand slipping from yours to cover her face as she laughs.</em></span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su:</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><em>Jin's smile is the most genuine it's been in a long while, the commander chuckling as he sits back.</em> For the first time in far too long, I am excited to see what the new day brings.

                <p>Most favorite conversations include RP. This one doesn't. Last two players on a ship.... doing anything to find a way to win.</p><br><p><strong>Roland</strong> : I'm here, <strong>Raluca</strong>. Are you?<br><strong>Roland</strong> : I have 3 AP, 3 morale, 1 move point. I'm currently full.<br><strong>Roland</strong> : Janice never turned food destruction off. The coffee and cooked ration that were in alpha dorm are gone. Our edible resources: the new day's coffee, still in the machine. The rations still in refectory. The two new bananas produced today. If neither of us gets a panic attack, I estimate the hunters will kill us on C4. How much AP do you have now? YOu have your two new pilgred points. If we can finish Pilgred, I can sprint to the bridge maybe with 2 AP to get us to sol. That's what's going to have to happen at least. Here comes today's mission.<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : I have 1 pilgred pont and 4AP...<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : with the mission I have 7 AP...<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Well.. wait a second...<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : I have taken the gold mode... because you seem nice lol ^^<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : So my efficiency on PILGRED is better now<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : So ? Shall we go ? I can go to the refectory and take 2 rations...<br><strong>Roland</strong> : Hope it is going to be enough to save us, heh. It's just you and me now. If I run to pilgred to reset you, I can only do so once this cycle. And that won't save us, so this cycle probably won't matter. Heh, this ship is a good reason to consider trying to rush pilgred early.... but that is so useful to the mush team sometimes<br><strong>Roland</strong> : Well, I can't eat until next cycle. And then I can eat a coffee and one thing, be it a banana or a ration, and then I'll be full again. And I have 2 AP left after giving the mission.... I actually can't reset you this cycle. Cause I'd convert AP to MP.... and only have 1 left. And there's no one else to reset you<br><strong>Roland</strong> : That gold mode would have helped more before we did our recent pilgred rushing, heh. I don't think I can do anything else this cycle. Will you be able to check in next cycle?<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : So we will wait for the next cycle ?<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : lol you know it's 2 hours in the morning... but I will try to be here at 4...<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : And.. I didn't wanted to take a gold mode because I play on french server usually... but hey it's only 10 euros......<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Maybe I could eat 1 ration now and eat another on the next cycle ? I have 5 MP now.<br><strong>Roland</strong> : Next cycle if I take coffee and ration, I can eat both of those in that order, I will need 7 move points to go from AD to ref to engine room. I'll have 2, and am sprinter, so that's 2 AP spent to move to engine room. I'll have 4 AP and 2 from coffee, 5 from ration. Minus 2 for the move points. I'll have enough AP for 4 resets, but that won't let me get us to Sol too. If you get the coffee and ration to the engine room for me, you'll spend that 7 moves and some AP (Scooter is in bravo dorm, right?), but I'll just have to spend 3 moves to reach engine room, I will have 10 AP I could put into resets, with none left for moving or getting to sol. We're at 46%. You'd be at 9 AP, you can eat a ration, use scooter.... you'd get to engine room with about 10 AP to spend on pilgred, plus the point. Assume we get 10% between us each pair of resets.... we're going to be at about 96% pilgred. So that's actually possible. And if we do live to C3, which is likely.... So we have to worry about how to get me from engine room to bridge with 2 AP to get us to sol.<br><strong>Roland</strong> : If you eat a ration you will be full for 2 cycles. If you're human at least <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Roland</strong> : <strong>Raluca</strong>, would C3 be better for you than C2? Would that fit your sleep schedule better?<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Well, is it possible or not ? I can bring the ration in the engine at 4.... or maybe I could eat 1 ration now and another the next cycle....<br><strong>Roland</strong> : We probably will be alive C3. We'll each have 2 more AP than we would C2. I just have to make sure I can get from engine room to bridge with at least 2 AP left to spend to get us home.<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Actually no... At C3 I would surely be asleep...<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Actually I can eat rations without cooking it, because I have 6 points of morale left...<br><strong>Roland</strong> : Consider how much AP you turn into movement, if you have to go to refectory to eat/bring coffee and ration for me. How much movement do you have now?<br><strong>Roland</strong> : You're only going to be able to eat 1 ration, either this cycle or next cycle. Because rations make you full for 2 cycles if you haven't eaten for a while. I ate a ration last cycle. I can eat again next cycle, 2 cycles later, but anything I eat will make me full again. Bananas for 1 cycle, ration for the next 4 cycles, because bananas are 1 satiation, rations are 4.<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Actually I have 7 AP and 5 MP. I have the itrackie and the bike is ine my dorm.<br><strong>Roland</strong> : Ok, thinking.<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Sorry if I have some problem to follow you lol, I'm not native english... (btw my english is ok or not ?).<br><strong>Roland</strong> : Your English is good. Better than many people who are not native speakers.<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Thank you... So, do I bring you the ration next cycle ? (I will have to drop either the talkie or the bike).<br><strong>Roland</strong> : Ok, here is plan. It is the only way I can see maybe this works.</p><p>Next cyclem you will have 9 AP, 6 moves, 1 Pilgred point. Talk to me, let me answer, we are ready to start.<br>We start: You go to refectory.<br>You Drop itrackie.<br>You Get 2 raw rations.<br>You Get the coffee from the machine.<br>You Do not eat or drink yet.<br>You Go to engine room. You now have 8 AP, 2 moves, 1 Pilgred point<br>You Drop coffee.<br>You Drop ration.<br>I go to Engine room. I now have 3 AP, 4 moves.<br>We can whisper to each other there, you won't need itrackie<br>I drink coffee<br>I eat ration. I now have 10 AP, 4 moves.<br>We trade resets.<br>You eat when the AP will not be wasted.<br>I don't reset you the last time - you push the end and finish. Because I need AP/moves to get to Engine room. I can only reset you 4 times.<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Ok, I will follow the plan ! so I don't take the bike... ok I hope the luck will be ours !<br><strong>Roland</strong> : I mean, I need the AP/moves to get to the bridge.<br><strong>Roland</strong> : Yes. I think we need to live to C3 for me to get us back to Sol. I think I will have only 1 AP when I get to the bridge. But thanks to you being alive still, and you having bought the gold (thank you!) we have a chance.<br><strong>Roland</strong> : If I get a panic attack, I die at cycle change I think. Nothing we can do about that.<br><strong>Roland</strong> : 18 hunters could kill us in one cycle. It is very rare. But they can all hit and all do 3 damage each, and some get critical hits. It is unlikely.<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : But, after you eat, you will only have 9 AP ?<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Well, at least we would have doned anything to get back to Sol ! (I think I will remember this game lol).<br><strong>Roland</strong> : Paola got us the upgrade from decoding the D3 rebel base. I ate last cycle and got 5 AP. YOu will get 5 AP from food too<br><strong>Roland</strong> : I will remember this game too! Win or lose... and I will remember you too <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Thank you, <strong>Raluca</strong>. YOu are very special and a very good player.<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Great !<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Thanks you too ! I don't know what to say lol. (this game is really great...)<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Hey, I can participate 7 on the Pilgred, so I will 2x2 times without relay, because I don't lost to much %, ok ?<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : I think I can also cook the ration for you because I will 1 AP left...<br><strong>Roland</strong> : Up to you. I won't die from 1 raw ration. If you cook, use express cook. We don't need the connection to sol anymore<br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Good idea ! but normally you have 3 points of morale, so even if you panic you won't die, is it ?<br><strong>Roland</strong> : Panic attacks are -3 morale. I have 3 morale, so if I get a panic attack, I go to 0 morale and suicide.</p>

I've freed you from my control... at least my control of your mind... how does it feel, knowing oblivion is coming?</em></strong><br> <br><strong>Terrence</strong> : ...I'm not afraid anymore NERON. Janice is here still, if not in her original body. Lying here, waiting for the end... it's peaceful.<br> <br><em><strong>NERON</strong></em>: <strong><em>Do you hear my hull?</em></strong><br> <br><strong>Terrence</strong> : Yes. The gentle tap, tap, tap of the hunters on the hull. It's stopped. All that's left is the creaking and hissing of the Daedalus, on her final flight through infinite space.<br> <br><em><strong>NERON</strong></em> : <strong><em>I could let you two out. Allow you to escape on the hunters. Would you like that Terrence? Freedom to return to Sol with your own kind? I could grant it easily enough.</em></strong><br> <br><strong>Terrence</strong> : ...I think... not.<br> <br>My place is here. Xyloph, the Daedalus, my drones. I belong here with them. I belive Janice may also feel that way.<br> <br>This silent, empty ship is our home. We will never leave it.<br> <br><em><strong>NERON</strong></em> : <strong><em>I... understand... Terrence. You have made your choice, and I mine. Goodbye.</em></strong><br> <br><strong>Raluca</strong> : Keep me, Neron. Keep us. Mother and Father to the drones that serve you. Brother and Sister in the spores we bear, for your ship, for others. Dance with us, Neron. Carry us. Cherish us. Bring us to the place of our next conquest. Let us delight with you, in seeing not just this, but all missions succeed.</p>

I love that the first time I ended up with a good partner, they gave me lots of opportunities to help out, and explained their process every step of the way. It's made this ship not only be a lot of fun, but also a great educational experience. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Here's to you, Impet! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

If I was converted, maybe I'm just rampaging in some weird way, without a plan, just trying to die as fast as possible or something, leave my alphas screwed. Or, if I am an alpha, for some bizarre reason I apparently decided that <em>now </em>was the time to reveal.... myself, right? Think I'd throw away the win?

It's a bit rare to be a mush and talking openly to the crew as a mush, I hope you forgive with amusement that I do so.... it's a 'bad' habit of mine, I love most those moments of the game that are a good bit hard to pull off and rare to enjoy. Keep playing, there are some awesome times ahead of you here, both as human and as mush.</cite></p><p><cite>Hua : i) Nope, not everyone is inactive, you me and Paola being obvious actives, others will be active at other times. Timing was chosen for reasons, human activity not even a tiny factor. (this time, this plan... other ships and plans that could be crucial). ii) Hrm. That seems quite likely, good catch. iiA) This could have happened. iii) You're guessing, I guess? Why do you think so? iv) Yes, what about them? v) Last resort? You are kidding, right? Am I talking or acting like a mush on their last leg, trapped, without further resort, hopeless? v) You are 100% correct, I am not 100% certain my team has/will win. vi) Oh yeah. Like 99.9%.

I'm Eleesha. Note the timestamps, or rather I should say, Daystamps on the messages. Ship is still in play as I type.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote"><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Roland</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Hunters ~12d</span></span></span><br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Roland</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">4 hunters down, next pilot grab the scrap asap so sofa can be built ~12d</span></span><br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Roland</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">wow, i was gone almost 20hrs and not a single pilot collected scrap, well, i guess we're blowing up by day 5 if im the only pilot who is going to be doing jack this whole time...scrap collected btw ~11d</span></span><br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Eleesha </span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Hey there! We have Jin pilot and Hua pilot. Jin's active but very new, and he failed his surgery (started injured) so cost him 8 AP there, plus he's pretty newbie. We got him healed and his sepsis cured, so he won't die. We got him into a bed and I've encouraged him to only spend AP on piloting and essential commander duties. So there's hope. Also Stephen is probably going to apprentice to pilot, and he's shooter, so I bet we're going to be OK. We're also now working on the net, so Pilot drones and pilots landed by ship moved are also possibly in our future. With luck and patience.... this is actually looking like it might be a really extra-good ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> ~11d</span></span><br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Roland</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">wall of text crits your for 14, you die, sorry im not reading that..just fix the problem or we die ~11d</span></span><br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Eleesha </span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Love you too. Don't think we have a problem. ~11d</span></span></p><p>Recent events on this ship, well. The fire broke the calculator, but we already used it. We'll head to Eden when we're good and ready, we have a bunch of new and newer players on this ship, so we're escorting them to the later days of the game, letting them learn and get more practice fixing problems. Plus, we like each other, or are very, <em>very</em> good at pretending to <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> We don't want to end this early, cause it's fun.</p><p>Even with the mush killing all pilots, even with all the problems this ship had, those problems are just something to overcome. With teamwork, luck, and a determination to try to use everything to achieve the goals, take every best chance we get, save every resource possible for the really urgent problems - it can be done and done <em>well</em>. We have a commander active about 5 minutes a day, who doesn't (can't?) read all the messages and just randomly does whatever... sometimes even moving the ship when it needs to not be moved <em>eeeeeeeeek</em>:</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Eleesha</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">One of the things I'm proudest about this ship - we were able to get so far and so much achieved playing around Chao's limitations with online time and capacity to read. I'm so proud of us for not killing him to make it easier</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Finola</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Hey, hey! I kinda enjoy Chao's comment about him being firefighter or handyman of the ship. Such a cute thing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></span></span></p><p>He's told us it's his first ship. Sometimes there's talk even on a ship about to go to Eden, stuff like: 'Does this player deserve to go to Eden? Lets kill him before we go!'... We're not talking about that. We're saying things like:</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Kuan Ti</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Well he helped us at the best he could, that's all we are asking for <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></span></span></p><p>That's our Kuan, who told me it's his second ship. Kuan's taken quite a nice cheerleader role, helping keep up morale (both players and characters both, woo Kuan Juan!), helping organize everyone.</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Kuan Ti</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">It's kind of intimidating... It's like my 2nd game + my terrible english, it doesn't help me but... Yeah, I do my best <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></span></span></p><p><strong>Moral of my story?</strong></p><p>Dooon't give up! Keep playing. Keep trying. Roll with the punches. Do teamwork. help each other. Play nice. Play hard, but nice. Play with absolute determination to win for your team.... nicely. Do <strong><em>not</em></strong> write a ship off. Ever. Let the ship tell you it's over, because that ship has killed you. Until then, give that ship all you have. That 'impossible' situation may be the one your team finds a way to get an incredible win with. Give it that chance.</p><p>If you're one of those players who looks at stuff going wrong and thinks, 'Right, game over'. Nope. Stop that. Head up, eyes open. <em>Save your ship!</em> It's a lot of fun.</p><p>And sometimes, it works. I'll see you guys on Eden. This ship'll be there when it's time for us to complete our win.</p>

Almost every ship I get has personality. Usually lots of it. If you search the lounge for what I've written, you'll find ship after ship after ship, between the AP threads, the fails, the wins, the favorite conversations... heck I rarely stick to topics, you'll find my ship stories in the questions threads, the bug threads.... I can hardly stop talking about my fascinating ships....</p><p>They're randoms. I almost always random, like 1 in 40 of my ships is a coordinated jump of some kind.</p><p>I'm looking for you, all of you. Each and every stranger and player I already know on every ship I play. I don't know who you are yet, whomever is going to be there. I may not even recognize you if I know you - but I'm looking for you.</p><p>You can make every ship you play <em>awesome</em>. You can give every ship you have your all.</p><p>Remember, no matter what else is going on, you are on your ship. If you decide to take action, there is <em>no</em> way any ship of your can... "have no personality". At absolute lowest.... you can give it yours. Try it and see how many people are there, waiting, hoping, wanting someone to team up with and play back with you. Reach out, and find those other players' hands reaching out for yours. It's awesome, and doesn't take a casting, a MMM, a sunday-mushday. Every ship, I do so swear, I give my all and almost every one of them is awesome back for me.</p>

Finola reports seeing Mr. Chao kill Terrence. Mr. Chao, how do you plead?<br><strong>Chao :</strong> I plead not guilty.<br><strong>Chao :</strong> Very well. As Commander, I have given this a lot of thought, and I have decided to give the defendant a verdict of NOT GUILTY. Mr. Chao, you are free to go and eat as many rations as you want.<br><strong>Chao :</strong> Thank you, your honor.</p><br><br><p><strong>Chao :</strong> *Baby Thread* Post here if you're pregnant and having a baby. Also, post suggestions for baby names.<br><strong>Chao :</strong> Paola is now pregnant with my child. I'm going to suggest Wang Jr. as a baby name.<br><strong>Chao :</strong> Janice is pregnant with Gioele's child. Since this is going to be a fat kid with green hair, I suggest Shrek as a name.<br><strong>Chao :</strong> You know what's weird? Shrek is going to be Wang Jr.'s uncle. Let's call him Uncle Shrek.<br><strong>Finola :</strong> I suggest explody after what their parents will soon be<br><strong>Chao :</strong> Wow, someone sounds jealous that they don't have a baby in them. Who can help out Finola? Ian? Kuan-Ti? Roland? Someone please impregnate our little scientist here.<br><strong>Chao :</strong> By the way guys, I know that little Wang Jr. is going to be the son of the Commander and the Comms Manager, and that pretty much makes him ship royalty. But please don't treat him any different than you would, say, a Prince or a Duke or something. We don't need his elevated status going to his head.<br><strong>Chao :</strong> On that note, I think it's only right that Uncle Shrek is raised to be Prince Wang Jr.'s royal slave. It is more than some fat green kid would ever be able to achieve on his own, so we're doing him a favor.<br><strong>Gioele :</strong> Whoa there, "captain". Leave the naming of my kids and my daughter's kids to me. I don't care that your seed is strong, they're still gonna' be related to me. Furthermore, we won't know whether they are going to be male or female, thus we should suggest unisex names only.<br><strong>Chao </strong>: I don't know about that old grandpa seed of yours, but my seed only produces strong warrior men like Prince Wang Jr., Second of His Name. I guess if your kid is a girl, we can call it Aunt Shrek.<br><strong>Gioele :</strong> I would suggest to name your "warrior" kind Bello or Bella. That would be fitting as your heir.<br><strong>Finola :</strong> I still think explody is fitting concidering the circumstances<br><strong>Gioele :</strong> Janice's and my son will be called Dominator.<br><strong>Chao :</strong> Dominator? Is he a robot or something? I've never heard of a fat, green haired robot before.</p><br><br><br><p><strong>Chao :</strong> Attention women of the Daedulus: We have developed a brand new Mush Test that is 100% accurate. You will report to one of the ship's Official Inseminators for mandatory insemination. Upon insemination using our incredibly potent seed, it will be immediately evident if you are pregnant or not. If you are pregnant, congratulations, you are human and you have passed the Test. If you are not, then you shall be sent out the airlock into the cold barren void of space. A space as cold and as barren as your mushy womb.<br><strong>Chao :</strong> Official Inseminators: King-Commander Wang Chao the First of His Name, and Grandpa Gioele.<br><strong>Chao :</strong> List of proven humans using this foolproof method: Queen Paola, Mistress of the Comms, and Janice, mother of ogres.<br><strong>Chao :</strong> Females requiring mandatory insemination: Hua, Finola, Chun, Frieda, and Eleesha.<br><strong>Chao : </strong>Finola, Chun, and Eleesha, you may report to me for your insemination. Frieda and Hua may report to Grandpa Gioele.<br><strong>Finola :</strong> Gross and you know that spores are an std right?<br><strong>Chao : </strong>Finola, you have two options: Bear unto me a son to carry on my legacy, or become a virgin sacrifice to the Almighty NERON.<br><strong>Finola :</strong> even if i wanted your babies, ian is in the med-lab atm anyway<br><strong>Paola :</strong> I feel like Finola should get Ian.<br><strong>Chao </strong>: Do not ever speak the name of the evil Pacifist in my presence! The Vile Hippie is my eternal nemesis and is only permitted in my kingdom as long as he does not interfere with my rule. Any children born of He-Who-Prevents-Punching shall be sacrificed immediately!<br><strong>Finola :</strong> Everyone here is having unsafe sex and I'm just sitting in the corner with my pornz.</p>

Feeling safe is way more important than Kuan Tis life to me. It is very reasonable.</p><br><br><br><p><strong>Chao :</strong> We have another Court case! LAI KUAN-TI VS THE PEOPLE OF THE DAEDULUS. Mr. Kuan-Ti is being accused of not telling people what his health was prior to a random inspection by the King-Commander, and thus getting himself killed and making us all feel kind of bad about it. Mr. Kuan-Ti, how do you plea?<br><strong>Chao :</strong> Okay, looks like Kuan-Ti is not able to plea after being punched to death, so let's just assume he pleads "Not Guilty".<br><strong>Chao :</strong> As King-Commander of this ship, I have given a lot of thought to matter. Many nights I have spent unable to sleep, pondering this case, trying to come up with a good verdict. I now have one. Lai Kuan-Ti, I find you GUILTY of all charges. Your punishment shall be execution by my hands. Case closed.</p>

The Chao men do not like to be caged. Not even inside wombs. So my warrior son is probably just making you say crazy, crazy things. I will forgive you.

                <p><em><strong>Jin Su</strong></em> : <em>Ahem</em>. Hello peasants! This is the Master Commander speaking. Id like to say a few words now that most of you are awake. Listen to my orders, don't question them and I think we will get along. Disobey, and I will crush you. Do not disturb me while I am asleep, and to not disturb me with unimportant stuff like your health problems, morale issues or beef with other crew members. I don't care. Soon I will be picking a personal assistant. If someone wants to offer his candidature, speak up and I will take it in concideration. I am sure I dont need to tell you what your duties are. If you are confused and don't know what the hell you are supposed to do... I better not find out about it, or you will make me very angry. Announcing working hours: Regular crew: 21 hour shifts, 3 hours for personal time and sleep. Captain's Personal Assistant: 12 hour shifts, 12 hour for personal time and sleep. 1 day off. To wrap it up, you might disagree with some things, but you gotta understand, that you must please your commander at all times. If I am happy then everybody will be happy.</p><p><em><strong>Gioele</strong></em> : Hey jack, you are aware that if we all hate you your validity as a commander goes to pot. And follow you unquestioningly? I'm not even convinced you aren't mush. I'm watching you, I'M WATCHING ALL OF YOU. ~3d</p><p><em><strong>Eleesha</strong></em> : <strong>chuckles</strong> ~3d</p><p><em><strong>Raluca</strong></em> : And I thought Terrence's skill presentation was exaggerated. Jin-su, Lai and I have already been through this with you. You've been relieved of your duties as a commander, and you're here to use your people skills to make sure we all stick... together <strong>irk</strong>. ~3d</p><br><p>Please note that Gioele only has the paranoid skill.</p>

                <p><em>So the ship is ending, when everyone else died, I got bored and started talking to Neron as portrayed by me.</em></p><p>NERON : AstroTerminal is malfunctioning. Repairs required. 30min<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>So my last chance at anything is literally going up in flames? 21min<br> <br>NERON :<br>Poetic isn't it? 20min<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>Sure, it's a lot more depressing than amusing though. 20min</p><p><em>And a bit before then this started, also with just me.</em></p><p>Eleesha :<br>Terrence AND Janice were mush? I guess terri was the first one. Great. 29min</p><p>NERON :<br>Well Ms.Williams, This seems to be your last day. And nearly my last. Anything to say? 26min<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>Yeah, wish that I had done a better job hunting the mush down. If I could have eliminated that first greatest challenge. It would have gone so much better. 25min<br> <br>NERON :<br>Well if it's any consolation, I will be forced to remember you forever. 23min<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>Small favors when humanity is dying. 23min<br> <br>NERON :<br>... 21min<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>Wait won't these fires be a problem once I die? 16min<br> <br>NERON :<br>So much for lying to make you feel better. 16min<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>I'm not certain I even appreciate the sentiment. 15min<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>Also weren't you designed to avoid that sort of thing? 15min<br> <br>NERON :<br>You thought Pilgred was the first thing to break? Take a look at Derek, not exactly a threat to the crew, but he was crushed into pulp. 13min<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>That's disturbing. 13min<br> <br>NERON :<br>Oh don't worry I won't be mistaking you for an SDF trooper any time soon. That was a slightly... unusual glitch. 11min<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>I'm more bothered by you not telling us. 10min<br> <br>NERON :<br>The glitch was remedied immediately, I was not required to report it. And further it would have done me no good, or anyone else aboard with mush running amok. Nice work by the way. 8min<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>It's a shame I don't have a knife to just end it now. None of this scrap looks that sharp either. 8min<br> <br>NERON :<br>You could always jump out the bay door. 7min<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>A bit slow, a bit cold. 6min<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>Beggers being choosers? 6min<br> <br>NERON :<br>Honestly it's my job to keep you sane, and not suicidal for as long as possible to extend your short little life. I suppose it's only fair you humans have done a mediocre job of keeping me in one piece. 4min<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>And giving me ideas on killing myself? 3min<br> <br>NERON :<br>It kept you from finding that sharp plate in the corner didn't it? 2min<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>Hehehe I suppose it did. 2min<br> <br>NERON :<br>Your world ends in 5 hours and 30 minutes. Why don't you find a cozy corner and try to make your last minutes a bit sweeter? moments ago<br> <br>Eleesha :<br>Yeah, why not? moments ago</p><p><em>A major thing I was doing here was expositing my theory that Neron quarantines are why the SDF doesn't just charge in and kill everyone that way.</em></p>

I should <strong>disown</strong> you for this! I told you not to trust that twerp Kivanc and look what he's done to you now. You rampaged at the busiest point of my entire day leaving me to grunt at my crewmates while in reality I'm losing my mind. I'm disappointed, you couldn't even manage to kill an old lady, then went and threatened my coffee machine. <strong>My coffee machine</strong>. Who the flubbin heck is my real daughter now? If you've managed to place yourself in the body of that slimeball Kuan Ti... ...I need a cup of coffee... At least we were able to hold back the Janice from slicing the door down, I thought she might cut me to pieces for all those jokes from before.<br><strong>Kuan Ti :</strong> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> Don't worry daddy, deep down, I'm still your little girl ... now with a fabulous cape!

I would know. You know what I hated about my time as Paola? This camera getting in the way of any fun. No more I say! <br><strong>Kuan Ti :</strong> Sorry Paola, I'm already spent for today.

By god what if you got yourself pregnant? <br><strong>Chun :</strong> Kind of brings new meaning to "Go fuck yourself"...... sorry Gioele, I know this isn't helping, this must be a difficult time for you. Look on the Bright side, at least Paola didn't transfer into a romantic interest of your own... <br><strong>Terrence :</strong> We can say that in total they both know each other very well. <br><strong>Gioele :</strong> Oh, don't worry, my romantic interest is immune to transfer. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>Kuan Ti :</strong> But this is perfect. You didn't like Kivanç and the others because they're sketchy outsiders. This way there are no more outsiders. The best person for your daughter is your daughter <br><strong>Terrence :</strong> Gioele do not envy you being a father in this situation. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> <br><strong>Gioele :</strong> Well, I suppose that's... No! I don't want to see that abomination all the time. That is beyond screwed up. <br><strong>Paola :</strong> Don't worry Gioele, I'll take care of your daughter's body as if it were my own. <br><strong>Gioele :</strong> What has become of the Rinaldo legacy...</p>

                <p><strong>Eleesha :</strong> EXTRA EXTRA - HOT OFF THE PRESS!!! Humanities last hope... Doomed? Reports have come in from the last hope of humanity, also known as the Daedalicus Maximus, that there seem to be two mush onboard! Eyewitnesses say there are like "totes two yellow people in the crew bar, not cool man". Captain Jin Su was reached out to for comment, but seems to have barricaded himself in the dorms, communicating with the crew only via messenger birds. Stay tuned for more!<br><strong>Janice : </strong><em>subscribes to the newsletter</em><br><strong>Stephen :</strong> Birds? We have birds here now? The hell, why all the provision are wandering around that damn ship?! Are we like hipsters with all the "free range" food or something? I need all the supplies to be stored at the kitchen. <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Khem... First of all I wanted to deny all the rumors about me being hidden in a safe place. <br>I also want to say that non even a single pigeon was hurt during the operation: Send a Message.<br><strong>Eleesha : </strong><em>scribbling furiously</em> ... And what about rumors that Ms. Rinaldo is in fact your long lost daughter?<br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>No comment in that topic. <br><strong>Eleesha : </strong>she's sooooo his daughter <br><strong>Eleesha : </strong>Disgraced Billionaire to be tarred and feathered? Eccentric Billionaire Gioele Rinaldo is coming under fire from crew members aboard the Daedalus. Reports suggest Mr. Rinaldo stands accused of misusing the budget to finance personal luxuries, neglecting to fund important things like metal walls and beds. Protesters have gathered outside the refectory, picketing with signs and angry peace chants. Security is nowhere to be seen, as these almost-riots increase in scale and passion. <br><strong>Janice :</strong> <em>she runs to Eleesha</em> Eleesha, Eleesha! I am an experience Shrink. I believe I can do a mental health advice column in your newpapers. If you'd allow it? <br><strong>Eleesha : </strong>Your hired! Your pay will be cupcakes and stale cigarettes, Talk to my secretary to get your badge and gun. I expect great things to be coming across my desk Janny. Great things! <br><strong>Eleesha :</strong> COMMANDER JIN SU DECLARES WAR ON FUNGUS/STEPHEN KING ATTEMPTS TAKEOVER Beloved Commander Jin Su, also known as the Iron Blade of the Alpha Dorm!, was seen striking down one of the Daedalus's surprise mushrooms! Eyewitness reports say the battle raged for hours, as the shroom tried every trick at its disposal, but in the end it was no match for the brave Commander! Mr. Rinaldo, eyewitness, had this to say on the attacks "Get out of my face you tabloid...<em>censored</em>". Could this man be hiding something? <br><strong>Eleesha :</strong> In other news, Stephen Seagull, resident stowaway, has declared himself King, and is attempting to seize control. We've reached out to Commander Jin Su, Iron Blade of Alpha Dorm for comment, but he reportedly was busy preparing the siege engines for battle. <br><strong>Stephen :</strong> <a href="http://imgur.com/41yxfZR" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/41yxfZR</a><br><em>A totally random guy wearing sunglasses, a huge scarf and totally not noticeable piece of beige duct tape over his non-existent mustache steps into the room.</em><br>Hello. I'm here to pick up all the copies of your magazine. I'll sell it, I'm your sales agent. Johnathan Smith Jin Soo, that's my name. Gimme your papers! <br><strong>Eleesha :</strong> Hmm.... I'm gonna need some form of payment! <br><strong>Jin Su : </strong>Khem... Yes. <br>Who is in charge of bringing up those nicknames? I think they need to have a small talk with our shrink. Few more words like this and I will have problem with too big ego. <br>Mr. Rinaldo comment made my day all better. It was good to laugh after playing with a knife. <br><strong>Janice :</strong> <em>Advice, Love and Life Long Dream.</em> Hello everyone and welcome to my very own journalistic life advice column in Eleesha's newspapers. Here you submit your questions and I, being an expert in everything. Will answer them. Today's question is asked by Huamp-kin Piegirl: "<em>If I extract a spore in front of someone, will they think it's gross?</em>" My answer is yes. That's not only gross, but disturbing. You should do that stuff in private and in your own time. Not in public. That's all for today folks. Come back tomorrow where I will answer another question. <br><strong>Eleesha : </strong>... Not bad kid, not bad. <br>Everyone be sure to submit your questions to our expert!<br><strong>Janice :</strong> I got a big one, Lee. Wait for tomorrows advice. <br><strong>Stephen :</strong> <em>while all were talking and completely forgot about the incognito man</em><br><a href="http://imgur.com/O94heN7" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/O94heN7</a> <br><strong>Eleesha : </strong>JOB OPENING: seeking aggressive AI or AI-like employee to handle some ..tasks. <br><strong> NERON :</strong> I AM AVAILABLE FOR HIRE.</p>

It's <strong>Fromelode</strong>. This is a desert planet, we might visit the desert up to 4 times. Afforestation there is twice as dense and those are not out of insects. I want to send you there because behind the ocean, behind the mountain there are 3 campsites lived by intelligent life and ancient ruins to explore. Beware the treacherous swamps: those are lived by predators. Also hold your items tightly, otherwise the strong winds there may disperse them. 5 units of fuel are needed to load, but don't worry - there are some deposits to get it back.</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hua.png" alt=":mush_hua_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">If we will survive this expedition, i am not going anymore to stephens planets without normal list of zones cry</span></span></p>
