                <p>More specifically, <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4683">this ship</a>.</p><p>Jin Su here, glad to have just made it back to Sol in one piece. We tried to make do without any Techs which was a little easier with two Logistics Experts, but it was disappointing when we had all the pieces for two Sofas.</p><p>Actually the first time I've really had a consistent and effective Research team to complete the cure, so cheers to Ian and Chun for that. It was good to have a couple of active people to organise things behind the scenes, even if Ian and I clashed on many issues.<br>Other than those two though, the rest of the crew petered off rather quickly in the end with a few inactives or simply not doing as much as they could. The notable exception was Raluca, who definitely came alive once the Mush were gone and finished PILGRED in a couple of days. I was somewhat worried that you had been converted, being the only one not to have used the MycoScan, but the end screen showed you as blue.</p><p>On the topic of the Mush, we expected far grander schemes to be going on than that. An inactive Gioele and one of the worst Pilots I've ever seen in Andie. She only extracted a spore once the entire ship, which was the only time she got Dirty and was soon noticed in one of her long bouts of standing around in Bays. I am sorry that we ended up murdering a human Eleesha, but Ian and Chun (in the other investigation/organisation chat) agreed that you were acting weird. With a bed the entire game, probably quite a few of my Logistics points, IT actions for your relays and the Scooter, we really didn't know what the hell you were doing with your AP.</p><p>Ian and I had a conversation about Glory, unfortunate to see him pipped by Chun with only 1 difference between them. As expected, being the only competent and active Pilot won me the top spot.</p><p>Thanks to all who did work for the good of the ship when they could, but some bad luck and poor organisation brought us back quite soon.</p>
