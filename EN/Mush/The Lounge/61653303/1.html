That broken camera was so perfectly timed.</p><p>Although, I wasn't constantly showering because I was pulling shrooms. I actually just kept getting dirty when I already had two spores. It was <em>really</em> annoying.</p><br><p>Either way, to those of you who were active, thanks for playing. Even if on the human side it seemed boring, probably.</p>

                <p>Hey there, Finola here! I had a lot of fun on this ship, which is all due to a few active players, as the overall activity wasn't great. Half the crew was inactive most of the ship, or were active but didn't talk much.</p><p>In the beginning I played for the human team, and Chun and Eleesha were my biggest allies. We comunicated and were definitely onto you Jin, and we wanted to act soon on it. But I haven't played in so long, I had no idea starting spores were a thing. So while I knew I had almost surely been infected in IB when going on the expo, I was convinced I was at 1 spore.</p><p>When the Camera broke down in AD I ran for the Lab to get to safety, but then I passed the Drone and I thought to myself, 1 cycle unprotected will most likely not be my end. And maybe you would make a move and we could confirm your Mushiness and eliminate all doubt. So I though I'd go back and TA-DA! There you were in AD, in my bed. Confirmation successful, you were clearly trying to get me, and I didn't even have to do anything! I was feeling so smug. And then BAM! You infected me once, and becouse of that damned starting spore that was all it took. I was now turned, and Anonymush was taken instantly.</p><p>After that you were quickly dispatched, and we colluded with Kuan as to how to proceed. Initially, I wanted to act as a Mimic and remain in the shadows, leaving Kuan with the task of trapping shelves to advance our cause. Both Eleesha and Chao had 1 Spore each, and my god, they were volunteering for the expedition! <span class="tid_wspoil">[I think this is when Chao hit a trapped shelf right before entering IB, but I forget if that is the case or if Kuan infected him after the expo]</span> Perfect timing, soon our ranks would double. The plan was in place, but then Frieda jumped into IB and displaced Eleesha, and I was forced to go offline by life, and when I came back Janice has recoved from being braindead the whole time and was now replacing me on the expo.</p><p>The perfect plan, ruined. But that planet had been previoisly visited by our kind, and spores were lurking in that Cristallite zone. Chao was turned due to this, and so now we had all the power we needed to bring the ship down. Chao and Kuan DESTROYED the human ranks with a couple of nicely thrown Grenades, followed by some Knife weilding (goodbye Eleesha and Hua, the most active members of the human team; and Janice too beat the dust). Chun and Frieda tried desperately to kill Kuan, but with the Armor on him, it proved too difficult. He survived with 1 HP. At that point, I realized my turn was up. I healed Kuan to max (only took 4 AP, how I love Finola) and quickly dispatched Chun and finished poor Terrence. Then a Ceasefire ensured we had time to regain our strength.</p><p>With only 4 humans left vs our 3 Mush, the plan was we would turn Frieda, as she has spores already, and I would transfer into Raluca to rush the PILGRED Reactor. Gioele would be killed, and Paola would remain as the last human to the very end, right until we decided to go back to Sol. But we didn't account for the Hunter army, sadly. In 3 cycles, we lost 30 something Hull. When I reconnected, it was too late. Only an hour left till complete and inescapable destruction.</p><p>I killed Frieda quickly and forced suicide on poor morale suffering Paola, but Gioele and Raluca where too far away, and my AP's were not enough. The ship blew up.</p><p>We met our end.</p><br><p>Thanks to everyone that made this ship a fun one! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Glad to hear from you Finola.</p><p>Honestly, from the start I knew that I had a big target on my head. Getting dirty so much (even if it was legit) and never being able to fly out hurt me. I wish I would've been able to stick around and see it all go down, but hearing that me turning you caused all that chaos makes me happy enough.</p><p>I'd love to hear some of the human perspectives, or what Kuan has to say., Hopefully people check the forums.</p>
