I can't remember everything about this ship but I'll explain my experiences the best:</p><p>The beginning of the ship when Eleesha killed Stephen, we (the mush hunting team, Chun, Derek, Jin Su, Gioele) was very suspicious of her being Mush, because it was out of nowhere, so our #1 suspect was Eleesha, the suspicion was short lived when we found out she had Gastro. For the rest of the time she was alive she was being a nuisance, not speaking with anyone (including Chun) discovering all the hidden items on the ship (ALL of them). She was only kept alive because she was tracker and got gastro. Anyway... After that the ship was pretty much silent with paranoia. After the first expedition (which I slept through, Janice <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)<br> I saw you were the one who gotten ill, but I was a cycle late so I assumed it would be too late to health check you... UNTIL you mentioned that you healed yourself in the medlab, I went to check and there was no illness treated, so at that point, I knew you were mush, I was going to kill you, but... you chose Diplomat so I thought you were playing hidden mush. <br>I knew Raluca was able to grab Genius so I waited for Paola to grab the disk... and waited.... and waited, we were waiting so long that we discussed with Chun if we should kill you or not, Jin Su assumed this meant kill, so he grabbed the blaster and two lens, I told him we haven't discussed it thoroughly and we still are waiting for the Disk, then he decided to drop the blaster and lens in the same dorm as you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> <br>I knew you were going to do something... and you did. The deface in AD meant Jin Su and me (Gioele) could no longer be in the mush hunt, so now it was only Chun and Derek in the mush hunt, I told Chun that I think it was Either Jin Su or Eleesha infected, but it could be anyone before I left the channel. <br>A few hours later they invited me back (I think because they were conflicted <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ) and I told Derek we should act before either get online, we decided to kill Eleesha, and we were right. We decided that we were mush free after this, I was a little scared that we weren't, so I checked people's humanity throughout the ship (illnesses, eating, etc), and almost everyone confirmed themselves sooner or later.</p><p>Later throughout the ship Chun told me that people were suspicous of me being a hidden mush... I found this funny because I was caffeine Junkie but gladly Chun knew it was nearly impossible for me to be one after PILGRED + Coffee.</p><p>(PS: When I said I saw you dirty in AD, I just said that so people would be more inclined to kill you, I didn't actually see you were dirty but since Eleesha was standing and there was no sign of transfer, I assumed you were trying to frame her and guessed you got dirty <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> )</p>

If I had remembered that, Janice would've died soon before she used defacer in AD. It's been a long time since I played this game. So of course, mistakes were too be expected. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I'm not sure what Eleesha intentions were. Running around the ship and probably setting off all trapper spores, so that's another suspicion she was mostly likely the 3rd Mush. She found a hidden mage book, who someone else hid it for reasons I don't know. She decided to keep it for who knows how long without letting anyone know (she was still human at this time) and then dropped the technician mage book upon her Mush death.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">By the way, was Eleesha following Chun footseps? According to room logs, soon after Chun hid the hacker kit in the Engine Room, Eleesha comes in later and finds the hacker kit. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></span></p><p>Jin Su, there was a 50/50 chance you could've died by me. We had no clue who was the 3rd Mush that was converted by Janice. We the Mush Hunting Team had an intense conversation and carefully decide which one of you were the 3rd Mush. The others in AD mostly stayed under the camera the whole time. But you Jin Su have been moving, eating a lot, so there was a chance you ate a spored food and you always went to expedition with us with Janice. Eleesha must have been in every part of the ship, so I assumed she was infected by the trapper spore and Janice converted her with the final spore. There were many possibilities, it was either you or Eleesha. So as you can see, I was basically flipping a coin here and I feared I might have ended with two tails in a row. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico"> In the end I chose Eleesha since she was the most suspicious. And wolla, she was 3rd Mush. After that, I was 100% positive that we were Mush free since Janice couldn't do much by herself in short amount of days.</p><p><cite>A few hours later they invited me back (I think because they were conflicted <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> )</cite></p><p>We invited you back because I could easily tell you were not Mush by your words and actions. <em>Or maybe I'm just gullible.</em> You were the fatherly figure of this crew. It was quite an upset to see you leave like that.</p><p>Also... Some people thought you were Mush, Gioele?? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/surprise.gif" alt=":anim_surprised:" class="tid_ico"><br>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-</p><p>I was okay to go to Sol without the Serum if the steel plates were doing more damage then our healing, I wanted everyone to return to home safely. Jin Su, if you were really that desperate to leave, we could have left you in a patrol ship and move the ship so we could continue our Serum research. Or something. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But Jin Su, what I was most furious about you was that I was THIS <strong>&gt;&lt;</strong> CLOSE to having my virginity cured! I'm not kidding! I was ready to tear down the camera and kick everyone out of the dorm to make some privacy for my new lover as soon as I saw you take the scooter with you to the Bridge.</p><p>But alas, I didn't make it in time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The game even taunted me by awarding me the "Space Virgin" title. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p>
