                <p>Talking about <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/13269">this ship</a></p><p>I started out as Paola <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/paola.png" alt=":mush_paola_50:" class="tid_ico">... Mush <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> It was sad because this ship was very active, with an incredible projects rush. I started doing my job normally to avoid being suspicious, I very quickly got the magebooks (robotics expert and pilot) and kept them for myself and secret with the excuse that there was no active confirmed human to give them to/tell them about (Chun was inactive and Derek had pushed her into a storage).</p><p>My partner, Janice, triple-spored a ration which Hua later ate. Meanwhile Andie was trying to convince the crew to kill Chun, and Jin Su moved the ship away from trader (to trade Chun) and base. I vaguely tried to talk to Stephen about Andie being suspicious but he wasn't very active and I just never got an answer in time to try to get Andie killed.</p><p>Catastrophe: Chun woke up, Kuan Ti temporarily saw a third Mush in crew bar when Hua ate the ration, mush hunt team kills Hua and Janice, I wake up to find myself bronze Paola Mush all on my own. People talk about there being little pilots, and maybe little techs... Janice is dead and only Jin Su potential leader could be a moral source, a lot of people are low moral. I still haven't revealed pilot magebook, and will very probably be killed if people discover I withheld it in this time of piloting crisis.</p><p>I wait for the evening and prepare my rampage plan. Moral base is transmitting, it mustn't be decoded. Stephen apprenticed pilot, which makes Jin Su, Andie and Stephen the only pilots. Jin Su went out for Hunters so he doesn't have much ap, Stephen can be solid and probably has ap stored, my transfer target is chosen. I pull a spore, go to bravo dorm where I find Jin Su. I hit him several times, keeping just enough ap to spore Stephen.</p><p>I go to alpha dorm to transfer into Stephen... Ian <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.vg/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"> is in the room, spiking costs 3 ap instead of one. No problem, cycle change is just a few minutes away, I lie down and immediately spike Stephen after cycle change... Transferring costs 2 ap <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> I think it's the end for me and just throw a vague accusation at Jin Su with an announcement, hoping someone will rush to finish him off without checking. Lame rampage <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It's 1 a.m. and I almost go to sleep, but Kuan Ti answers immediately, so I decide to wait a bit. If they want to kill me, Ian has to get out of the room, and if he does I can transfer into Stephen... Humans start talking, Ian talks too. Andie adresses me directly, saying they know I'm waiting to transfer into Stephen and asking some questions about Hua's conversion. I'm tempted to answer... but what if it's a trap to check if I'm online? I stay silent and continue to refresh the page... until Ian leaves the room.</p><p>Then I acted quickly, drop pilot magebook, transfer into Stephen, read magebook, finish Jin Su off, punch Andie a few times for good measure with my spare ap and take off in a patrolship. This rampage, with the horrible wait in the middle for Ian to go out and my heart beating so fast... I was just so frightened <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> Anyway I finally answered Andie and chatted a bit, then went to sleep.</p><br><p>Crew then abandoned me (and the base <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico">), rushed Pilgred and went back to Sol <strong>without serum</strong>, so I consider it a mixed victory between human and Mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Hoping to see some of you answer this post, you really were a hyperactive and very cool crew <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"> And I hope you didn't find my final effort too pathetic</p>

                <p>Chun had the apron for more than 24 hours, that's why i wanted to see her dead asap. Investigating what happened was interesting, but not too complicated, because it was the only possible option to convert the new mush. Janice got dirty on expo, everyone leaves IB except her, she uninstalls the camera as excuse to move it to Nexus (to extract spores directly in IB), superfreezer is in IB to superfreeze alien steaks -&gt; source for spored food. Hua takes a ration from IB. Good play from Janice.<br>Current meta is nobody bothers with RFS anymore, kill all the mush -&gt; go home.<br><em>Andie</em></p>

                <p>Jin Su here. Very noob move by me to rush us out of orbit, but I have had a good 3 or 4 year hiatus. On the day I died, I had a feeling that I would be killed. I decided not to log in in the morning, which proved to be a fatal mistake. Had I checked the game, I probably woulda lived. Oops.</p>

                <p>Very late on this, but I was the Chun on this ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico"> I was absent for three days due to a power outage in my area, and it's honestly a miracle that I managed to come back when I did. I returned probably about an hour before I would've been traded, and managed to make up for the lost time by helping with the investigations and sniffing out those remaining Mush (I think they'd already killed one by the time I woke up). Sadly, the Mush did a sizable blow in my absence and kept us from making it to Eden, but given how bad the start was I was happy to take that over a full loss <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
