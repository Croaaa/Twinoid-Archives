                <p>ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7666" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7666</a> (7 and number of the devil!)</p><p>Here will be an Ap-thread soon, I will edit this entry later and tell you moire about the ship.<br>I am Kuan Ti and it was an intense game again, we managed to get a human win, somehow.<br>I will tell about our troubles and fails later.</p><p>Update:</p><p>When I joined this ship I was very pleased, it seemed to be a ship with very many active people.<br>IVery strange was that our gold Frieda went inactive after selection, well, who knows. Finola, no jokes about her dying in RL again plz! ^^</p><p>On this ship, the RNG was with us, very much. <br>Paola got with her neron u√ºgrades GPU and plasma shield! Both of them saved our lives I think.</p><p>The mushes in the meantime did realize our biggest weakness: pilots. <br>And only one technician/physicist with Raluca (at least it seemed like that to them).<br>Their plans were nice and I think many crews would have been screwed up with it.<br>Not this crew though. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>What they did:<br>First mush, Hua, did realize that she is only active pilot (frieda inactive, Jin took shooter skill instead of pilot or leader, Roland was inactive and took also probably only sprinter-i am not sure)<br>She said, it would be hopeless and she would suicide<br>(side note: I am actually a bit disturbed that a mush is pretending to suicide since actually no person is allowed to suicide in the first place, well.)<br>I tried to talk her out, especialy since we got plasma shield just a little time previously. But not long after my try talking her out, Roland was suddenly active and had killed Hua. The lack of hesitation made it obvious for Ian, Eleesha and me that he was mush. So I went to get my hidden knife. Unfortunately Eleesha didn't wait for me and started punching him, Roland realized it, did flee, hide with Ian, who was fortunately active. So I was able to slice him a bit, but wasn't able to kill him. Chao wanted to torture him to make sure that he is mush, well.. His torturing did kill Roland then <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So Hua did tranfer into Roland and, killed her old body. And we killed her new body. One mush down! yes! but no pilot left <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br>But we have plasma shield, right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"><br>mhh, there is still the wave of 12 hunters...<br>...<br>what? we lost a bit hull and plasma shield is disabled? <br>Oh no...second mush, Janice did switch plasma shield off besides from death announcements, also she demoralied Raluca to death, who died at cycle change, took both extinguishers with herself (we had no extingusiher blueprint) and took off with pasisphae!</p><p>new situation: 12 hunters, no pilots, no extingusihers, janice in pasisphae.</p><p>our current projects in nexus were Trail minimizer at 90% besides of magnetic net, so discussion followed whether we shoudl try to finish net now or not..especially since we have 12 hunters and no plasma shield anymore (hull was around 30).<br>Finola did hack nexus and did switch plasma shield on again.<br>I suggested to just finish TM, move and try it with firefighter drones, I also loaded 1 fuel.<br>But Jin was inactive... And what did Chun do with the hacker kit? she hacked again nexus, just to prevent access to projects, haven't understood her motivation yet.<br>Also neither Chun nor Ian did guard AB2 unfortunately.<br>So,... noone had ap to hack us anymore and jin was inactive. cycle passed..cycle passed.<br>Chao got the commander title, he should move. Well, he was not active at that time.<br>I was able to accumulate some ap and dismantled 2 weapons for scrap, was speaking privately with terrence so he could upgrade our starting drone to firefighter.<br>We met in RC and guess what happened? Just at that time the following absurd situation happened:<br>(logs of RC):</p><p><em>Kuan Ti helped Terrence to get out of the room, brotherly help is a beautiful thing. moments ago<br>Terrence left the room moments ago<br>Kuan Ti entered the room moments ago<br>Janice left the room 1min<br><strong>Janice has picked up the Support Drone</strong>. 1min<br>Janice entered the room 2min<br>Terrence has dropped the Support Drone. 2min<br>Terrence has been hammering away at this poor Robo Rex #65. It's for the best though. Robo Rex #65 has been upgraded to Fireman 2min<br>Terrence has picked up the Scrap Metal. 2min<br>Kuan Ti left the room 2min<br>Terrence has picked up the Scrap Metal. 3min<br>Janice left the room 3min<br><strong>Janice</strong> entered the room 3min<br>Terrence entered the room 3min<br>Kuan Ti has picked up the Anti-Grav Scooter 4min</em></p><br><p>WHAT? When I saw Janice I thought that Terrence and Janice are both mushes, so I did flee to prevent getting spiked. And Terrence seemed to be fully oblivious to the entering Janice, he did upgrad ethe drone and dropped it..and Janice did grab it nstantly xD she also instantly hurried back to Ab2 and took off .<br>What we noticed later was that she also visited nexus, switched plasma shield off again! xD and demoralized Stephen very much, she must have had a very quick internet connection, I was returning to RC to maybe guard, or look that the drone is safe, but no chance for my slower connection...<br>How is such a thing possible? we thought that terrence is maybe her mush partner and Eleesha shoudl confirm it by printing the list after Janice is dead. Fortunately 2 cycles later Jin was active again, did move us away with Trail minimizer and we lost many hunters <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>(if peanutz is reading: TM worked perfecly this time, so it seems I really was very unlucky in the past with it: we had 26 hunters and lost 19 of them after moving).<br>But Eleesha died of depression, so no confirmation whether we are mush-free possible anymore. Terrence being very helpful convinced me then that it was just a very strange coincidence and Terrence was innocent.</p><p>so here we are: with 7 hunters, plasma shield at 27, hull at 20, no single extinguisher or chance to extinguish anything.<br>Only chance: Praying and finish pilgred very quickly. And it did work <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>Janice, I was a technician too! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I didn't choose technician in beginning though. I chose it very late, when Trail minimizer came up and I didn't tell anyone about it. That saved my life as well as the ship.<br>In whopping 6 cycles we managed to get pilgred from 10 % to completion (new record with technician for me i think), the dependable relaying partner Finola and Terrence , the logistics from Paola, some eating and Jin's mission in the end helped me very much.</p><p>And so we made it!<br>Btw, GPU did save us! A day before we were able to finish pilgred, there was a message: "Fire directive cancelled". We would have been dead I think, if GPU wouldn't have triggered a that time!<br>So much luck for us, we had no single fire!</p><p><strong>why that name of ap-thread??</strong><br>It all started with Finola.<br>She literally punched me in beginning of the game for making a "dumb" joke with words ( I think it was: "Frieda: I await your healing in medlab, I am patient" "Kuan Ti: ofc you are, Frieda, your are Finola's patient!" )<br>Since I withstand her punch very good (well, it was only a literal punch xD) I suggested later to name the plasma shield "Plasma Kuan Ti".<br>When the ship ended I got a real punch of Finola though, after making another joke with words <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br>(At least I was able to get intimate with her! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"> )</p><br><p>Thx, people, it was fun! <br>Special thx to Finola (such a temperamental, but dependable woman!), Terrence (such a cute newbie. He always did smilies without eyes: ) or ( or ))) - when I asked him out he said:" they are disabled like me )) " ), Paola (nice person, thx for your witching power with the neron upgrades and helping me getting ap), Ian ( dependable and experienced) and Jin (poor Jin-he was inactive because he had to go to hospital at that time, I hope he is doing well now!), Eleesha (good mush hunter, did trust me though Ian didn't trust me ^^). I also liked Stephen and Chao, Chun too despite of her hacking I didn't understand.<br>And actually also our mushes Janice and Hua were good, nice try of them, they did a promising strategy with the knowledge they had - But ... I am playing sneaky even as human <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> <br>Lesson learned for the mushes I guess: Rush strategies have always the disadvantage that you need to take care of every single detail. Even if the plan seems like a sure win, if you overlooked something, if you get surprised by the RNG or you couldn't see everything, because the humans didn't show everything they have hidden in their sleeves, then the win isn't so sure anymore.</p>

                <p>Jin Su here,</p><p>Thanks for the write up Sperbi. I gotta be honest, when I first met you and Finola I thought you two were a little bit cocky. However as the ship went on, you guys were actually pretty cool.</p><p>I remember the crew giving me the business over my skill choices (shooter, cold blooded). But the reason for the choices was simply to try something different, for fun. So I switched it up a bit, because why not <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>I had a medical issue IRL so I was pretty inactive, talk about a bad time to pick Jin Su! Luckily this flight played out fairly quickly so I didn't need to do much.</p><p>The mush actually played a good game denying us pilots, putting us on a short clock. Not much we could do with our shield and hull rapidly approaching zero. Even running from hunters with the trail minimizer I think we had 25 or 26 hunters on us when we returned to Sol.</p><p>Finishing Pilgred was unexpected, I thought we were done for sure. But this crew honestly surprised me. Everyone rallied toward the end to finish at the last minute. So it was fun to pull out an unlikely win.</p><p>Anyways that's just some quick comments.</p>

                <p>Seeming cocky is part of my Kuan Ti roleplaying. Or at least roleplaying Kuan Ti is amplifieing seeming cocky ^^<br>You were a nice active commander (in exception of the time where you got ill of yourse), so your wrong skill choice wasn't such of a desaster (but seriously, that is probably the worst possible skill combination for a silver Jin Su <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I would still name that skill choice as "fail". Not to critisize you as person, but to tell you my opinion regarding it. And I did tell it only one time, well, maybe elaborated it a bit, but did not dig further into it later)</p><p>On the other side who knows what would have happened if you had not chosen these skills-maybe Janice and Hua wouldn't have accomplished their rushing plan involving killing pilots and would have used a strategy, which would have been even more dangerous for us, so maybe we wouldn't have been able to win then, who knows.</p><p>Thx for the game!</p>

And without your last mission in time, I wouldn't have been able to finish pilgred, I thought I would be able to eat at that time again, but no, still full at cycle 1 despite eating at cycle 6, I should pay more attention at the times when I have to eat often to calculate my current satisfaction level.</p>
