                <p>Title explanation: From day 3 onwards, I killed one crewmember per day. I mean, SOMEBODY had to fill in for Chao. You know, since I killed him. With my knife. Staby-stab <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"> (ok, Terrence helped...)</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1993"><strong>This is the one link to rule then all</strong></a></p><p>Though I could start things up with Chun's last transmission, 'cause I'm proud of it.</p><p><em>"This is it. We came this far only to be squashed out of the sky by those accursed creatures. There's so much blood... I know that only the MUSH will hear this but it is my responsibility to do a last report. The away team was left in a strange alien planet. They had oxygen and enough food to survive a week at least. If you hear our distress signal, track our last know position and you may yet rescue then. The chief of security is dead... I killed him. Stabbed him, over and over again. He didn't even try to resist. Funny how these details come back to haunt you. The captain was compromised. I don't know when he was infected, but he jumped the ship right after the departure of the away team... So I killed him. Simple, clean, just one pull of the trigger and it was done. But somehow it was not enough, I keep hearing his voice, mocking me, LAUGHING at ME! That last jump... I guess something went wrong, the bridge is on fire and none of the crew seem to have noticed it! They just stand there, empty eyes staring at the void while the flames get closer and closer.... I couldn't take it anymore, I bolted and locked myself in the engine room, where they can't get to me. If you are hearing this, DO NOT board this ship. Do not try to save us. They are all infected, I'm all that is left and they won't get me. They will never get me. I know it, and the captain knows it too... He's not laughing anymore, he's himself again. And he gave me an order. My blaster still has a charge and I know what I must do now. This is Zhong Chun, acting Chief Researcher aboard the Deadalus, signing off."</em></p><p>Well mates, I actually really liked our ship, even though t'was a massacre. T'was my first time playing Chun (I'm used to playing Finola and it shows, I'm really possessive over the medlab. MY medlab.) I'll try to document everything that happened, but remember that this is from my point of view, I would love to hear from you MUSH people.</p><p>D1~2: As far as ships go, those where fairly normal days, nothing special happened besides the fact that we lacked a proper researcher (Finola decided to stop and drool in the kitchen) so we couldn't really expect to do much research, despite the fact that the rest of the science team was fairly active (why don't I ever have this many dedicated lab assistants when I'm playing Finola? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico">) Oh, and Raluca stole the cat and took it away to the engine room! I didn't think much of it at the time since I could always ask for it when I needed to build the NCC lenses.</p><p>D3-Chao was acting weird... He stopped communicating all of a sudden (coincidently just after being asked to pass a MUSH test, because of his suspicious behaviour) was constantly dirty, ate rations, consumed random pills... I know every Chao is crazy, but that is crossing the line. I got contacted by Jin-Su and Ian, who also found his actions to be suspicious and were debating whether or not to shoot him. I found it VERY weird that you would be debating about suspicious behaviour with each other instead of with Chun. I was the only trustworthy person in the ship at that point in the game and I had to make a good effort not to shoot you both instead. but in walks Chao, carrying a medkit from the lab down to my medlab. Huh. Why move an important piece of research away from the lab, and why would he need it? He didn't take off with a ship, there hadn't been a fight and he didn't report any accident. Then he takes ANOTHER random pill, and I make my mind. He's either a MUSH (and a bad one at that), a griefer or a stupid player. Since his character was not critical to the mission, that meant that he had outlived his usefulness and hey, there was always a chance that he could be MUSH! Stabby happy time ensues <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"> I couldn't finish him off, so I go over to Ian for protection and Terrence finishes him up. Sucker punched by a crippled man, the chief of security should be ashamed of himself...</p><p>Turns out that he was a human. Oh well, you can't win then all. The captain gives an speech about the importance of self-sacrifice so that he doesn't need to sacrifice himself. Good for morale... I guess? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"></p><p>After that great speech, we had a good discussion about booze and the properties of chryogenic fluid and it's potential application as licor. I tell you, that's the future! T'is not like we can get sick after we begin serving our great MUSH overlords, in any case...</p><p>D4: We finnaly were able to finish ONE research. Hooray. And we also found a good planet, so we start planning an expedition. I wouldn't go because that would be too tempting a target for the MUSH, so I didn't pay much attention to it. Jin-Su hugged a steel plate that day. Hard. With his head. So I had to cope with his unwelcome advances and healing requisitions. I move over to the medlab in disgust... But he DID make that great speech. So I guess we could do it, in the name of morale... Strangely, right after I accepted he began trying to postpone it... Well, it was not me who was going to get a depression, so too bad for him. (if only I had know...)</p><p>Jin-Su was also postponing his coming to the PILGRED, and delaying the expedition. Roland couldn't wait anymore and launched the PILGRED. We hear a slightly garbed transmission stating that they got there in one piece and the landing operation was a success... A smile crept to my face and then the entire ship shook! There was the sound of an explosion and NERON alarms went on about fires in the Deadalus. Before I can get my bearings I hear Paola's desperate screams coming out of the radio, something about Jin-Su being a traitor and jumping the ship and how she couldn't kill him despite having fired upon him a few times. That hit me hard (and knocked me to 1 morale), how could that be? Roland dead, Ian dead, Jin-Su a traitor... How could that be? They trusted you captain, I trusted you, you BASTARD! We were friends! I managed to reign my anger enough so that a few rational thoughts could surface. That could be an elaborate ploy, I didn't fully trust Paola yet... So I used my available AP to get to the hidden Hacker Kit and verify that indeed, no one had touched it. BLOODY BASTARD! (I am trigger happy and I start to see red fairly easily when someone kills the crew) I took a blaster (conveniently hidden right next to the hackerkit for just such an occasion) and took off after Jin-Su, sadly I did not have enough AP to make it past my medlab, so I try a desperate gamble: Taking a random pill. As luck would have it, I took the right one and gained 3 AP, enough to get to the cafeteria and eat a ration, gaining even <strong>more</strong> AP. I get to the bridge and noticed that Jin-Su had spiked Paola, but I couldn't understand why, so I shoot him in the head (and THAT was satisfying). The place was on fire and all the rest of the crew (excluding Raluca and Paola) were inside, empty eyes staring at the flames while droll runs down their chins <img src="../../../../gfx/square/drowl.png" alt=":drowl:" class="tid_ico">. I hate inactives <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Sadly, killing a friend left me with 0 morale so... Damn. I looked over at the map and located Schrodïnger... In the engine room <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> I had enough APs to make it there and when I finally arrive, I'm rewarded with the fact that Raluca is STILL holding on to the cat. And I would not be able to kill her before the end of the cycle. Such Joy!</p><p>But it was a sobering thought after all, and the rage-induced wheels in my brain finally cool off enough to connect the dots. The MUSH indicator is still showing TWO alive MUSH. Jin-Su had been face-Plated and would have been a fairly easy kill for anyone, ESPECIALLY someone who was already in the room with him, like Paola. He did not try to flee the scene, presumably for lack of AP. But if that was the case, why waste it trying to spike Paola? And what a nice coincidence, for her to have come online precisely at that moment! It dawned on me. I'm an idiot. And I could have killed that MUSH so easily if I had just paid attention to the signs beforehand. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"></p><p>D5C1: I bite the bullet, so I don't know what happened afterwards.</p><p>As a conclusion: Bravo for the MUSH <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>that was some smart playing at the end, killing 3 crewmembers and leaving me to kill the remaining human on the ship and dig my own grave, all in the same move <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Terrence here. Yes, I was <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">, I'm sorry to say, because you were all great. I want to say though that I didn't lie -- it was really my first time playing Terrence.<br><br>Seeing that Eleesha, my <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> partner, had gone inactive and after having also struggled as a single mush with an inactive partner for the previous two games against a ship of active people, I decided I would take a less serious approach and barely logged on this time. It seems that was enough for me to stay covered until my real opportunity came.<br><br>You guessed it - the opportunity was Chao. With everyone asking me to help take him down, it was the perfect chance for me to run out and spore like a madman, I mean madmush, especially with my partner inactive - all the spores were for me. On my way up to kill Chao, I decided to deliver the Sofa parts to the Bridge, and noticed the camera on the Bridge. <br><br>This told me instantly that there was no camera in the Lab, so I passed by the Lab on my way to Chao, and lo and behold - there was a single banana. With no camera in the room to stop me, I shoved both spores into it, then took out another spore and carefully decorated the banana with a mushroom sign with it (Only visible to <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">, of course). Then I walked into Medlab to find Chao bleeding in a corner with his limbs cut off and pills and foam spilling out of his mouth, so I punched his nose in and stuck my shoe in his mouth and he suffocated after a few minutes. <br><br>Ian, being as dutiful as he was, went up to the Lab the next cycle to check on his plants. Noting the single banana was there, I assume he didn't want it to go to waste, and so he brought it over to Alpha Dorm, where Jin Su and I were sleeping. I was aware of this, but I needed to sleep in real life. I had no idea what kind of chaos that banana would cause. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"><br><br>I woke up in the morning and everyone is dead, Jin Su left some hilarious messages in <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> chat, and the only two people left were a currently inactive Raluca and Paola (Jin Su) in the Engine Room, who finally ran out of gas to finish off Raluca. I went in, felt kind of funny, exploded into the hulk, and marveled at being able to actually walk on my own two feet before finishing Raluca off with a mighty Mush suplex. Shortly after Neron screamed that he was set free and proceeded to destroy Jin Su and I with Vanilla-flavored gas.<br><br>Honestly, if there were more active people I'd have lost. Regardless, it was a great game and I hope to work with you all (on the same team next time hopefully) again someday!</p>

                <p>Chun did a great writeup before she perished on the Daedalus as well, but only Paola (Jin Su) and I were alive to see it by then. It was actually pretty comedic on my side because initially Jin Su had no idea who had even spiked him and since I was asleep and Eleesha was inactive, he just ended up talking to himself in the Mush channel until I returned to find the entire ship already about to explode.</p>

                <p>The lesson here is never to leave in an expedition when the captain is not present. And Guji, the "inactive" cover works well, since we don't tend to suspect people we can't even remember are on the ship, but I guess is not really fun to play =/</p><p>I didn't think that NOT having a camera in the lab would hurt but the fact that you could infect a banana never crossed my mind...

                <p>To be honest I don't really like to play as an inactive Mush, I feel it kind of defeats the whole fun of deception when I'm not even playing and talking. It seems so much more fun to be just like every other crewmember and have it be a catastrophic surprise when the moment of betrayal really comes, like with Jin Su. I think I was just really exhausted from trying too hard many times as solo Mush against 10+ active players, and ironically as soon as I slacked off I got my first Mush win, although that's mainly thanks to Jin Su being a badass.</p><p>Mycoalarms can't detect food spiking, nor can cameras. The main reason it was important that the camera was not there was because I was already pretty short on AP/MP since I had to spore three times, deliver all sofa parts to the bridge, kill Chao, shower, and go back to the bridge and finish building the sofa to break suspicion, all in one fell swoop.</p><p>Simply put, I didn't have the luxury to run into the Lab, spore the Banana twice (Two spores is maximum I can carry), run out of the Lab, extract a spore, and then go back in. I had to spore in the Lab or I would have missed that crucial opportunity to instantly convert someone. If the camera was there I would have only been able to inject two spores, which means Jin Su would probably still have been a human during the expedition.</p>
