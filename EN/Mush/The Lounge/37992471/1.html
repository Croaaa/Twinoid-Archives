                <p>Curious about what people thought of this ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3771" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3771</a></p><p>I was Alpha mush Gioele. It started out as a ship with nothing unusual. Jin Su and I both rolled mush. Jin Su didn't speak at all, in general chat or in mush chat, so I was surprised when I saw he got himself killed by the crew after demoralizing an overly active Chun to death in the med lab. Probably the best person for him to kill at the time. Hua ended up killing Jin Su, and I managed to cast some momentary suspicion on Chao since he was active immediately before Chun died, and wasn't around when Jin Su needed to be killed.</p><p>So I was on my own for a while. I caught Kuan Ti with a shelf trap in the Nexus, and then I spored him twice at day change (taking down the camera, so that my shenanigans was less obvious in the Nexus logs). So then it was me and Kuan Ti against the world.</p><p>We tried to stay stealthy, but over time, people either food tested themselves or got sick, and I knew that the process of elimination was going to narrow it down to my new friend and myself. So I did the logical thing, and flipped the nearest table (onto Janice, of course). I miscalculated my AP and didn't do nearly as much damage as I would have liked to. But I was mutated, so there was no talking my way out of the situation. Kuan Ti joined me in my rampage, and after that I'm not quite clear what happened, but the ship lasted a lot longer than I would have hoped.</p><p>I didn't think this ship was particularly amazing, but the crew had a few really cool members. Chun, before she died very early, seemed very involved and active. Kuan Ti and Eleesha were both very good for newbies. Paola was the first to die of starvation and then the thick tube burned in a fire before the sofa was built, but despite this, Eleesha did an excellent job at comms. And Kuan Ti was a very good first-time killer alien, and he demonstrated a good understanding of in-game tactics and rules after a very short time to learn them in as a mush. And Raluca was pretty awesome, even if she missed a few days due to a computer crash and came pretty close to starving to death.</p><p>I really would have liked to been with this crew as a human. But I expected more mush hunting. Also, we had a mute Finola, and so I was able to take advantage by taking credit for some of her research, making it look like I was spending more AP than I actually had. Chao took to the commander role early, and Eleesha took the comms officer role early, and virtually nobody else was doing any serious mush hunting.</p><p>Near the end, that last expo with the cristalite, was probably the mush's last good chance to convert anyone new. Kuan Ti and I both had a spore extracted and ready, and Kuan Ti took the mush Traitor skill, so we were really hoping for the cristalite mush trap, and then hopefully spiking our preferred target as soon as the expo finished. Aside from that, the only person who got spored was Terrence, and anyone who hugged the cat after Day 3.</p><p>Anyway, it ended for Kuan Ti and I on Day 6. I ran the microwave and wrecked the signal, and then went to mutate and attack Janice, and Kuan Ti joined me shortly after. I'm not quite sure what happened after that, but I died the next cycle at the hands of a crew mate, possibly Choa.</p><p>For what it's worth, I would have preferred to be a human on a ship like this, and</p>

                <p>My biggest regret was not using the microwave on the Day 5 signal, when everyone was desperate to get it done with and get the morale boost. Chao and a couple of other key members were complaining about morale, and I really didn't think about it until it was too late. Hindsight is 20/20, I guess.</p>

                <p>Gioele - as I said to You in our private chat - You have my upmost respect to be honest about explaining mechanic of skills being canceled by being a Mush. You should also thank to Jin Su. Remember Chao claiming that "his lolipot" (that was me - Chun) wanting Him to kill somebody? Yep - if I would live few cycles more You would be assasinated by Chao. So Jin Su did BEST thing he could at that moment. Without me Mush hunt team lost it's (I think You will believe and support it) competent leader and only person they could trust to coordinate actions. Eleesha was doing great as my eyes at begining of game, but I HAD to delegate Her to comms early on, as Paola was brainddead (I love possibility to just seel them out).</p><p>But... Why I started suddenly to suspect You? Why? There were few reasons for that. First of all - in our private chat You said that in Your opinion asking You about mechanics behind skills that are lost when being Mush, could be very elegant and nice way of conducting a test - as Mush would for sure tried to decive me and give wrong information. In my opinion only very guilty person could think of SUCH a way. Of course that was not a proof on itself - maybe You wanted Chun to be VERY competent for Your own safety? Later You decided to take that freezer to Icarus Bay. Very good of You, but You also got dirty drinking coffe - I thought that You might use that as excuse to extract spore and trap Icarus Bay. Later, knowing that it will be most propably Hua that will be using Icarus and will be first to get into IB for expedition (survivalist and pilot) You started to Flirt with Her... Propably to do the thing and infect Her additionaly. Not granted, but nice bonus for You I would say. And lastly, and mosty... You were hurted afther taking shower. I saw it... I decided that Chun may not simply stay in the lab while Mush Hunt team is lacking Eleesha (She was comm officer). And I was about to sentence You to death...</p><p>But... WHY ON EARTH I DIDN'T DO IT EARLY? WHEN I STILL COULD? Firstly I was not sure who to trust, and if it is a wise to kill Caffine Junkie Gioele? I mean... I hate kill innocents and try to be absolutly sure to not do it even if they are "irrelevant" characters. And if Chao would be also a Mush, he would warn You and You could do something like killing Janice. When I contacted Chao in the end, I was sure and determined to kill You Gioele... But there was another problem - in my country (Poland) it was time to visit greaves of those famili members that are no longer amoung us (I am atheist, but tradition is tradition) so I decided that it will be perfect occasion to double rethink everything. Of course I decided that killing You will be best option in face of those suspicions. So Your fate was decided <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But ironical - when I was returning from graveyeard, my character went to one <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I must say I had much laught at this and was VERY interesting how things will go <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I was wondering did I managed to "defuse" any of Your traps? Because I went all way You did and was puting on shelfs items, and than picking them up... In refectory, in corridors, in Hangar and in Icarus Bay, and even in Nexus. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I hope that we will be both Hummans on one ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As I said - my utmost respect to saying how mechanics are working. I just hope that You said it to me not because you were affraid of it to be sophisticated "Mush Test" but because You do believe that informing about mechanicks should be ALWAYS honest regaldles of who You are - humman or Mush.</p><p>Fun fact - I was sure that You and Jin Su were very well coordinated, and that You as "Mush Mastermind" decided to sent Him on sucide mission to kill me as I was "too active" and "the only hope". Guess Jin Su decided it on His own <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Good Jin Su - You did best what You could.</p><p>[edit. Also - my first time posting anything on forum ^^ So... Hi ^^' Emm... I am a bit shy... ^^'']</p>

                <p>Hey, Terrance here. We already had you narrowed down to one of the main suspects for mush about 3 cycles before you went on an all out rampage with Kuan, we also suspected him suspected him. Me and Hua had a really small list which we were about to take action on, but sadly you had already took action before we could. you played well though mush. The only thing that cleared you partly Gioele was the gold project you bought for us, as we couldn't make sense of you wanting to help as a mush!</p>

                <p>Hey Chun, you're right and Jin Su couldn't have killed you at a better time, so props to him for that. He didn't communicate, but at least he knew exactly what to do. I really wasn't sure how much you suspected me, because as soon as I told you I thought you were testing me I realized that maybe it was an overly cynical thing to say, and it might have been seen as suspicious. I did extract a spore when I went to move the freezer, but that was because just like Caffeine Junkie, the Solid skill is also lost when you become mush, so I took phagocyte and ate my spore while moving the freezer and microwave. I laid one successful shelf trap, and that was in the Nexus right before I finally got around to installing a camera there.</p><p>And you're also right, I was hoping I could get you on my side because you seemed like a very active player, and getting someone like you to protect me early on would be very valuable. So I did my best to not lie to you, and to be fair I explained that the skills still show even though the mush can't have some of them; I didn't actually say that I was not mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> But when you asked me for my morale, that really caught me off guard, and after I answered I realized my calculations were off, I should have said 11 but I said 10.</p><p>Terrence and Hua, I was really afraid that you had narrowed it down to me, Kuan Ti, and one or two others including the inactive Raluca. When Raluca was inactive, I thought I had a decent chance, and I had though about finishing her off myself when she was taking starvation damage. But then she came back after her computer troubles were over, and bought a gold project as apology (which was a really nice gesture). I remember on a previous ship that some people believed that a gold project couldn't be purchased by mush, and the only reason I bought a gold project was because I wanted to test that theory (plus, it was a relatively useless project so it wouldn't hurt the mush team much).</p><p>I'm really curious about how things would have gone if we did trigger a mush trap on that last expo, and spored Janice in the alarmed Icarus Bay. The mycoalarm would have rang twice, indicating two spikings, and then it would probably have to resort to a 3 mush rampage. But since we didn't trigger a mush trap, we decided to save our spores for a better opportunity.</p><p>I knew I'd be caught eventually, so at a certain point I decided enough was enough. I would be offline for most of that day, so I began my rampage earlier than I would have liked, and with not quite a full AP bar. After I died, I ended up joining a ship as human Gioele that got kind of wrecked by the season change maintenance, so I understand your pain there.</p><p>Over all, most of the crew was really cool, I'm sorry I couldn't have given you a more worthy challenge. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Kuan TI - I felt like I did pretty bad in the game. I mean it was fun, but I felt a little out of my depth once I became mush, and every time I did something I thought "Oh damn, I shouldn't have done that." Or "I could have done that better/gone about that smarter." Which lead to a lot of wiki reading. It was a good learning experience. Do you guys have any advice or such?</p>

                <p>In the end I was hoping for gioele to die and quickly take anonymush and stay with you guys until the end of the trip. But when he couldn't take out Janice I stole the medkit and offed her and tried to off eleesha. I was one hit away from her death too.</p>

                <p>Haha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Now I do know that Golden players have one morale more than Silver and Bronze. But You were lucky that back then I simply didn't known about that. Should I know... Let's just say that lack of knowledge is sometimes Your biggest weaknes. Or maybe Your 10 morale didn't alarmed me because I honestly didn't expected anybody to be cought on such cheap trick? ^^ I am also glad to see that Eleesha was doing great job as Comm Officer... I am pround of Her <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Really! ^^'</p>
