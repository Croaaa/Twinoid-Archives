                <p>Hi, Ian here and that's the <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3390">End</a></p><p>It was a nice random ship. We had some good player which helped us to return to Sol at day 11, cycle 1 and had really some luck that it was possible:</p><p><em>1) The mushes were not that bad to us. Kuan Ti seemed to do nothing after he was assigned as mush and Chao played almost perfectly human. (But which made the mush hunting not very easy). Until one time in the journey where <strong>Chao </strong>with a full gauge of Ap tried to kill <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_eng.png" alt=":mush_pa_eng:" class="tid_ico"> Terrence, our only Technician we had at that point of time since Raluca was already dead (pilgred was at 6% and it was already around day 7 or 8...). Luckily for us he failed somehow.</em></p><p><em>2) we had a hull of 44 since day 5 and we were not able to improve our projects, too much things to handle with a small amount of people we had already at that time - already dead: Hua (starvation), Janice (starvation), Kuan Ti (mush), Raluca (staying in crowded lab for days-depression), Jin Su (misunderstanding). And we had a project difficult to finish when Terrence did already /had to do much other things: armored corricor. I said that we should advance a quicker project, but most people wanted to stay with armored corridor so we stayed with it (and weren't able to finish it until the end ^^).<br>5 of our 6 neron projects were from <strong>Paola</strong> and that was our rescue, because her last Neron upgrade was the plasma shield. I think without it we wouldn't been able to return to sol before the hunters would have destroyed us.<br></em><br><strong>Jin Su</strong>, we killed you, because you told us you got dirty from collecting scrap...but you were a human :/ ...that was sad since I think you were a nice player. What did happen exactly? I still wonder...</p><p>great people (I think): Chao (because he was a nice person even as mush ^^), Paola (she was quiet, but she did lots of useful things and her Neron upgrade was our rescue), Terrence (despite he had not much time because of work, he did what he could do and it was enough for us to win in the end), Stephen (incredible active -healing, expeditions, shooting hunters -whatever, despite he took the mage book pilot right at the beginning of the game without asking he used it well since we had not much active pilots and he killed Kuan Ti our first mush), Frieda (in the beginning she found us the planet where we got 24 oxygen-also our rescue and later she helped pretty much with important research, extinguishing fires and healing people), Gioele (a funny person, he wrote nice post-its, helped our security pretty much at the beginning of the game, helped always when it was necessary - killing mush, extinguish fires, ... and he was a great commander in the end), Chun (she healed much people and also did which was necessary like extinguishing a fire), Eleesha (she found us the hidden hacker kit and knife and had a funny death in the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> )</p><p>fun fact and cause of the name of the AP-thread: <br>One day before we returned to Sol Eleesha had 2 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> left and decided to repair the oxygen tank... it was her last action <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_calim.gif" alt=":hordes_calim:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Gioele here! Glad to see I entertained you.<br>And, as the final, absolute owner of the Daedalus, I hereby appoint Stephen owner of the Tomorrowland.

                <p>Chun here. Chao was way to suspicious, in the first days he sent me a message telling me he would find the hacker kit and give it to me. When i saw he was one of the members in the room where the hacker kit was hidden, i made a separate mush hunt chat without him. But everyone on that separate chat(including me) ended up ignoring that.</p><p>I think he got bored and decided to throw a grenade, we probably wouldn't find him without that and luckily his grenade didn't kill anyone.</p><p>I want to apologize to everyone for not being as active as i could but i was constantly out of AP and when i had AP it was used to heal someone. It started to become a little of a routine since that grenade damaged many members and the ship falling apart damaged even more. I lost motivation to log in sometimes due to being always out of AP and doing always the same thing.</p><p>Anyway, all worked out in the end, i believe Terrence saved us all with his work and it was a nice ship to play <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":tid_smile:" class="tid_ico"></p>
