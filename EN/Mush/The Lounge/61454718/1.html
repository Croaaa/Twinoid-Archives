                <p>Woke up as Kuan Ti to discover a few zombies in the lab, including a Raluca. Hull looked reasonable albeit with only one main pilot aboard. Ship was slow to fill, and we lost Raluca early on (no surprise there), and the other zombies pre-selection. The last to awaken was Gioele who found his walkie talkie and went to FBT to sleep.</p><p>Research didn't really progress slowly. Some research was completed pre-selection. CS was completed before the end of the first full day.</p><p>However, Chun in her wisdom saw it to assassinate Frieda, an astro/pilot in AD. Human. I have no idea why. So, with o2 looking low, I go to find a planet and with luck, found a 4 zone relatively safe planet (desert, mountain, ruminants, and oxygen). Chun died of fatal depression not long after.</p><p>Day 5 now and while I slept, a fire broke out in AD where I slept. The camera was broken. Eleesha left and returned. She had also removed the drone Chao had dropped in the dorm. I wake up and fix the camera. I also load fuel for my planet but did not leave enough mp to get back to a dorm and was dirty.</p><p>Terrence announces that Eleesha extracted a spore and so he assassinates her. Human, but can confirm Eleesha was mush. There was a transfer but who did she choose to become? With starting spores, and no apparent infection, could be anyone out of Roland (pilot), Janice (shrink), Jin Su (leader) or Terrence (tech). I'm still in engine room. In a back channel, Chao invited some of us because of research made or humanity proven. That included Finola, Janice, Jin Su and myself.</p><p>Eleesha had passed through medlab with Finola in. Finola came to visit me and convert me in Engine Room. An excuse for her dirt was that Eleesha slimetrapped her (in reality, Paola was slimetrapped). I now knew who Eleesha had transferred into - Roland. We both had starting spores. Roland, Janice, Jin Su (with a mycoalarm) waited in Icarus Bay. Chao was soaking up Paola's logistics and wanted to read the pilot magebook.</p><p>I head to BD claiming no ap to shower. I passed through RAS after fixing the door with a tech point. I discover the hacker kit and another pilot magebook among other things. I decide to keep the HK safe.</p><p>Cycle change came, and we arrived in orbit of the planet with loads of hunters. Janice had already turned pilot lock off as Roland said he'd be offline. About half-way through the cycle, Chao joins the expo crew and launches. O2 by this stage is at 1. With the ship looking not so well (hull quite low as well), I just about had enough ap/mp to load one fuel, extract via fertile, infect Gioele in FBT. I remembered to drop the hacker kit (my first ever transfer, I forgot to drop armor/weapons beforehand), then transferred into Gioele. He had become inactive.</p><p>Hacking took 8ap. And away we went. Was lucky there were no arack as it was D5. I head to AD and then think, I should water the plants just to see if we can cause more mischief (more conversions). With mycelium spirit, am able to extract again for free and infect Paola once. I soak up her logistics. She starts to attack me and I'm down to 3hp just before day change. Still, I get her logistics and at day change, extract again, infect, and issue Finola with a mission just in case she needed it. Finola comes online and finishes the conversion.</p><p>Now it is just a waiting game to see who died. Terrence suffocated at day change. 8 hunters had followed us. Hull was at 34. I went to sleep, awoke still alive, having lost all but myself and my old body. The hunters didn't aim very well. I died start of c5 and the ship lived another cycle until my old body's suffocation.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/12480">End page</a></p>

                <p>Eleesha/Roland here. It was a nice little intense trip for me. When I woke up, 4 zombies were already dead. But otherwise the ship was not looking bad. We had several active crew members. Apart from low O2, everything else was covered. We even had 4 completed researches. Soon after that, last person woke up and I was greeted with the message "Welcome to the cause, Dearest Mush". My partner in crime was chosen to be Finola. Our Chun had premonition, Chao had torturer and wrestler, others were looking competent as well, and I thought to myself that this is not going to be an easy ship which folds by itself. KT/Gioele has shared his experience from his perspective, but what happened with the mushes early on is known only by me and Finola.</p><p>I opened a channel with Finola and told her all the information I could gather from standing in AD. She was sleeping at the time and didn't reply for next few hours. When she did reply, she told me she had infector. As it so happened KT and Frieda were in AD and both of them had a starting spore. Chun had also joined us in AD and now she had logistics skill as well, in addition to Moh and premonition. Finola and I talked for a long period to figure out a plan that would convert both KT and Frieda using Finola's infector skill. It could be done at day change. She would need the cover of defacer skill but would not have enough AP to use it. So I leveled up myself to use defacer for her. The plan ended with her not being able to do everything on her own without my help and me not being able to be online at day change. (It really hurts that day change happens at 4:30 am for me). We thought about only converting KT but then decided against it as the risk was too much for the reward in the end. So, day 4 ended for me with a bold "ABORT" message in the mush channel. I went to bed a bit disappointed, but if we gained nothing, we also didn't lose anything on the day.</p><p>A new day was on the horizon but I didn’t knew it would turn out to be one of the trickiest day of mush for me. I woke up on Day 5 to a few surprises. Chun and Frieda were dead. Chun killed Frieda, nobody knew why. Then she died of depression herself. There were claims that some mush must have demoralized her. But we had no hand in her death. She might have used premonition a bit too much, or might have had panic attack, or both. These deaths tilted the game in our favour. Frieda was astro/pilot and O2 was getting low. But then, KT found a planet with O2 and a sense of calm again returned to the ship. KT had evolved as leader for the ship. Also, C. Serum was complete. No one would have thought of Finola as mush at this time. With me awake it was her turn to sleep. What followed was …. As I look back on it, it was a comedy of errors, interspersed with some moments of luck and good moves. I will take a break here and post some more later. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Finola alpha Mush here, I just wanted to research to my hearts content, but we had 4 zombies that starved shortly after selection happened and after seeing I was mush I was deeply disappointed, since I knew that doing research would just hinder me and my partner instead, but luckily I could delay doing much more after constipaspore since nobody relayed.</p><p>Seeing Eleesha as my partner and with almost no room for me to do anything mushy, I just chilled in the medlab, we had a plan of converting both of Freida/KT over daychange but Eleesha had to go offline 30 minutes before cycle change so timing was a little bit of an issue with defacer, and I got distracted doing something IRL and came back too late, just to see the big <strong>ABORT</strong> message, and seeing Freida had been killed by silent Chun, only to die in the next few cycles from depression, I reported Chun after I saw what happened.</p><p>After going to sleep I woke up and found out Eleesha was up to some shenanigans and had spored in front of inactive Terrence and transferred into Roland and <em>somehow</em> got away with it, and at some point infected Kuan Ti who also had a starting spore, and Roland suggested claiming being slimetrapped as an excuse to get dirty, and infect Kuan, which in reality he slimetrapped Paola.</p><p>So I waddled down to the engine room passing through Icarus bay while dirty <em>(which nobody picked up on why I walked through thank god)</em>, and converted Kuan in the engine room, then took anonymush, showered, and hobbled back to my medlab bed. Shortly after this happens the expedition takes place, with Roland on it, Kuan takes this opportunity to transfer into Gioele for more AP and hacks the command terminal, leaving everyone behind in the process on the expedition.</p><p>And all I wanted was to spearhead research so our ship would go smoother, and I just had to be mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>
