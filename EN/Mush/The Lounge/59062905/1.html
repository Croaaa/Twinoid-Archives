Pleasantly, instead of pure hate she is given reasonable advise on why should should really have take <em>Tracker</em> and so we move on.</p><p>While I'm laying there pondering the seemingly active crew I notice that <strong>Archer</strong> has woken up and entered the dorm and expertly dismantled the shower, which is a fine a thing, except he's not bothered to go and wash, and continues to not wash for sometime. I decide to move myself over to <em>bravo dorm</em> to get some quality time with the ship's <em>shrink</em> before other duties call me away.</p><p>I rest a little longer and see that the cryo system has shutdown, something has changed, I feel the taint...

                <p><strong>Evidence is a fine thing, but who has time for that?</strong></p><p>While I've been sleeping one of the highly skilled crew members, a golden <strong>Archer</strong> has been murdered in the <em>bravo dorm</em> by our head of security <strong>Chao</strong> who had briefly opened a channel with both myself and <strong>Chun</strong> to ask for permission and a mission to make the killing stating that he had been to <em>bravo dorm</em> following selection, washed, and was now missing health, but since neither of us had responded he had gone ahead and made the decision himself...</p><p>The ship is now missing half of it's <em>technical</em> staff, together with everything else <strong>Archer</strong> could have brought to the mission. I wake up and announce my displeasure with his rash actions however I have no interest in acting so quickly and losing another crew member. <strong>Chao</strong> himself however has already announced that he is waiting for the wrath of the crew for his rash actions seemingly accepting of death.</p><p>Whilst this situation is going on I decide to make myself useful and head for the <em>bridge</em> to help establish the connection and stop in the <em>lab</em> on the way back to help the research team which have been somewhat busy in the lab despite some argument about which research should be focused. As it stands the <em>constipaspore serum</em> is at some 30-ish %, whilst the <em>anti-spore gas</em> is up around 55%, I point out that I would personally have gone for the CS research first but there really should be focus at this point, and so I relay the ASG and head for <em>AD</em> to see the events that led to <strong>Archer</strong>'s death, and when I get there I see the late <strong>Terrence</strong> had assembled the <em>Lizaro Jungle</em> and was attempting to dismantle it in order to build the second sofa blueprint that was also lying in the room together with the <em>wrench</em> he has been neatly putting back on the shelf after each attempt. Dismantling showers is hazardous enough work but the also working on <em>Lizaro</em> the error of his ways was clear to see but yet he had a starting spore on him, so converting him was the first priority since if he were killed later it would be a very easy to believe fake alpha!</p><p>Speaking of Mush, my partner has contacted me during the night as well and is none other than our <em>observant</em> <strong><em>Eleesha</em></strong>, who it turns out is simply pretending to be a new player and to boot is also silver! Whilst I really don't like any fake new players for the negative stigma they bring to genuine new players I am obliged to forgive her, particularly when she's also active during the same windows as me!</p><p><em><strong>The second death, and an opening</strong></em> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It's now the middle of D3 and again thinking to maintain my humanity I send the daily mission to <strong>Paola</strong> to work on comms. which is quickly put to use, and as she's a gold <em>gunner</em> to boot I very much want her trust, but to bring some drama back to the ship, her father <strong>Gioele</strong> is not happy with the murder of one of the ships few <em>technicians</em> and so avenges <strong>Terry</strong> by killing <strong>Chao</strong> in case he decides to kill the other <em>technician</em> onboard, <strong>Raluca</strong>.</p><p>There is surprisingly little else going on on the ship in terms of excitement, the <em>pilots</em> are still completing their assignments like clockwork in between <strong>Paola</strong> shooting the hunters down, our hold is filling with scrap already and so it was a nice opening to see that <strong>Frieda</strong> has found us a worthwhile crystallite planet to visit and so we agree to visit.</p><p>So we have an opening coming as no research has been completed still by this point so the only question for us at this point in the <em>Mush chat</em> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> is who...</p>

I don't know if it's because of a complete lack of faith in the ship following the <strong>Chao/Terrence</strong> incident or if they didn't think the Mush were actually a threat at this point due to the generally low traffic in <em>BD</em> our prime target <strong>Gio</strong> has parked himself in the <em>IB</em> ahead of the crew gathering and we know this is about as good of a chance as we're going to get despite the watchful eyes on the <em>bridge</em>.</p><p><strong><em>Eleesha</em></strong> steps out of the <em>IB</em> to stop her <em>observant</em> from detecting my spikes and I move in with <em>infector</em> to get the first two spikes in without concern to getting spotted as dirty. <strong>Gio</strong> is awake however and more than likely has already decided to kill <strong><em>Eleesha</em></strong> once we get back because she leaves the <em>IB</em> to load the escape fuel as I have publicly asked for.

                <p><em><strong>Laying low</strong></em></p><p>Our timing is fortunate because before anyone can think to extract a 4th spore, the <em>ASG</em> is completed and the option is removed anyway.</p><p>I'm still calling for our 4th member to join whilst hoping I'll be online fast enough to launch us without them noticing that I'm dirty <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/stinky.png" alt=":mush_stink:" class="tid_ico"> without a reason so all the while I'm doing this I'm also praying that neither <strong>Frieda</strong>, <strong>Finola</strong>, or <strong>Paola</strong> come down to check.</p><p>They don't come down but <strong>Frieda</strong> is becoming very very suspicious of the whole situation, it's D3C7 and quickly approaching day change, and there are 3 dots in the <em>Icarus Bay</em> with neither a camera or a mycoalarm in position, and until right now not a single piece of anti-mush research in place. I'm agreeing with her and becoming more and more against the expedition myself, I don't want us to take any crew down to a crystallite planet after standing for an extended period of time, it's just asking for trouble.</p><p>We enter D3C8 and I call the expedition off and <strong>Frieda</strong> has announced that she's holding the <em>hacker kit</em> to stop abandonment, I open a private chat with her and ask her to keep hold of the kit regardless of any circumstances, however <strong>Stephen</strong> arrives around this time and so we seize the opportunity to launch and down we go. Somewhere in this period the <em>CS</em> research has been completed as well and so the "easy street" has been closed.</p><p>The planet itself is pretty dangerous and at size 12 we're not sure if we'll hit all of the desired zones. We don't have a lot of weapons with us although I have confiscated the <em>Lizaro</em> until such a time as <strong>Raluca</strong> might be trusted to dismantle it, and as the expedition goes on the away team are taking very damage although it's our newbie <strong>Stephen</strong> who's getting the short end of the stick and survives the expedition with but a single hit point! <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The crystallite zone however was not encountered, and since the expedition went over daychange I'm not willing to make an already wary crew more wary or take action against at least <strong><em>Eleesha</em></strong> who like all players who fake inexperience is really starting to sound like she knows far too many mechanics, I declare the planet too dangerous to visit and "eat" to have enough energy to be able to get back to the <em>bridge</em> and move us I take my final skill slot as <em>phagocyte</em> consume my <em>fertile</em> spore, wash to not arrive on the <em>bridge</em> dirty, and we leave orbit with me remaining on the <em>bridge</em> to help boost the bridge team with my logistics and I give my mission to <strong>Paola</strong> to help push more comms. work.</p><p>Having felt like we've pushed our luck enough by this point, and with <strong>Kuan-ti</strong> having now starved to death we consider putting a plant together for D4C8 conversion somewhere but we decide against it.</p><p>Checking in on the lab the next day however, I make a frightening discover... No one has been tending the garden, and our 2 starting <em>mature plants, have died</em>...

As the only morale source left I keep the line open and tell her to contact me with an sudden drops in morale, but while I'm talking to her she says something worrying and reminds us that we're not unstoppable...</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote"><strong>Raluca</strong>: We have an <em>anonymush</em> on the ship!</span></p><p>I don't answer for a long while but I inform my comrades, and so she becomes the next target but with it being only <strong>D6C4</strong> still it's going to be an uncomfortably long wait to be able to remove her as a threat.</p><p>In the meantime we've called for healing to the <em>IB</em> and a full Mush expedition team gathers in the <em>IB</em> with <strong><em>Eleesha, Finola, Gioele</em></strong> and myself and we launch to the surface.

We all returned dirty, and with it now having been day change as well I extract my next fertile spore and rest up in <em>BD</em>, the other members of the crew also return to dorms with the exception of <strong><em>Gioele</em></strong> who is peacefully sleeping in the <em>IB</em> albeit safe under the <em>mycoalarm</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>I sleep for several cycles and awake to move the ship out of orbit and we're back on the hunt for crystallite with a full oxygen tank, free reign over <strong>Raluca</strong>'s conversion is given so long as we remember not to be caught by <strong>Eleesha</strong>'s <em>observant</em>, the coordination takes a little time and this turns out to be a stroke of luck as <strong>Roland</strong> visits the <em>nexus</em> in the meantime to advance the current project and since we're not <em>defacing</em> and even that would be risky of course, the camera removal would have been spotted and the alarm would have been raised.</p><p>We're lucky again, and so the plan is made and the fateful team of <strong><em>Gioele</em></strong> and <strong><em>Eleesha</em></strong> move in to welcome <strong><em>Raluca</em></strong> to the fold, I believe <strong><em>Finola</em></strong> is online at this point to take up the <em>anonymush</em> shroud and so we have silently grown even further.</p><p><strong><em>And then we were seven <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> </em></strong></p><p>There might be some errors here but the collective is currently something like:</p><p><strong><em>Jin-Su</em></strong> - Leader, shooter, pilot, logistics expert / <em>Splashproof, fertile, infector, phagocyte</em><br><strong><em>Eleesha</em></strong> - Observant / <em>Splashproof, anonymush</em><br><strong><em>Gioele</em></strong> - Solid, paranoid, caffeine addict, astro / <em>mycellium spirit, fertile, infector, anonymush</em><br><strong><em>Paola</em></strong> - Shooter, gunner, logistics expert, rebel / <em>mycellium spirit, infector, anonymush, fertile</em><br><strong><em>Frieda</em></strong> - Astro, pilot / <em>Anonymush, phagocyte</em><br><strong><em>Finola</em></strong> - Medic, biologist / <em>Mycellium spirit, anonymush</em><br><strong><em>Raluca</em></strong> - Physicist, technician / <em>Anonymush, ???</em></p><p>With the remaining conversions being "easy", we're starting to arrange our long term plans and I'm to be mostly occupied with keeping our braindead (but gold) <strong>Chun</strong> from killing herself, I'm terrified of losing her and with fewer and fewer humans this is going to be a difficult task without a <em>shrink</em> onboard.</p><p>With 2 <em>logistics experts</em>, and 2 <em>astros</em>, we decide to split the beds in such a way as to give the <em>astros</em> 3 AP per cycle.

                <p><em><strong>Panic attacks for the humans, and for me!</strong></em></p><p>This reminds me that the only real threat to the ship now is NERON himself, if we fail to keep the humans alive then he'll take care of us! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/fear.png" alt=":fear:" class="tid_ico"> I call <strong>Stephen</strong> to attend the <em>lab</em> so that he can receive a speech from me together with <strong>Chun</strong>, and I head there and give a speech to help top up <strong>Chun</strong>'s morale although naturally we have no way of knowing what sort of level she's currently at, and still thinking about the remaining humans <strong><em>Paola</em></strong> and I have been keeping up our daily meeting on the <em>bridge</em>, to appear as if I'm caring for my own morale.</p><p>In the background our faithful <em>astronavigator </em><strong><em>Frieda</em></strong> has found us a planet with not one but <strong>TWO hydrocarbon</strong> deposits on it for relatively little risk, and waking up in the real world I check my phone to see the planet on the scanners, hear that fuel has been loaded and at 2 minutes to C4 I power the reactors and we're on our way! Straight after moving us however I see that my dearest <strong><em>Paola</em></strong> had actually called to see what the newest trader was thinking to trade <strong>Chun</strong> away for PILGRED but it's too late, and frankly I am against this plan anyway, we'd come this far secretly, doing ANYTHING that could risk our cover could result in the death of several of us, and inevitably the ship as well.</p><p>It's <strong>day 8</strong> now, and the last base has been decoded so we're now feeling more comfortable about <strong>Chun</strong> and also our <em>pilots</em> who have yet to let a single hunter survive more than 2 cycles, and that's including asteroids, because of this they're easily predictable, although worrying rested very often. I call for an expedition team to assemble in the <em>IB</em> but the Mush are suffering with some poor communication with several people not being able to be as active as before and we're failing to line-up to make the conversion of <strong>Hua</strong> in <em>BD</em> who has been chosen as the first of the pilots to be converted on our way to the expedition.</p><p><strong><em>Gio</em></strong>, me, and <strong><em>Eleesha</em></strong> have moved into position in the <em>IB</em> and <strong><em>Frieda</em></strong> is in the dorm keeping an eye on <em>BD</em>, but despite this we simply can't get our conversion team to strike quickly. This situation goes on for the majority of the day, but again luck is on our side because <strong>Roland</strong> actually visits the dorm to shower after repairing the door out of <em>AD</em> but since there were no camera logs there's nothing to see and he simply returns to <em>AD</em> to keep resting.</p><p>Eventually the star conversion pair get together and strike together and <strong><em>Hua</em></strong> is converted, together with a little science as demonstrated here - <a href="/tid/forum#!view/104909|thread/59051968" target="_self">The Functionality of Observant</a></p><p><strong><em>And then we were eight <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> </em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Raluca</em></strong> is awake to take <em>anonymush</em> to cover this conversion (I must have been early with my Mush skill list above) and so we manage to get this conversion done STILL in secrecy, 8 Mush, with only 2 visible on the crew bar! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/keepcool.png" alt=":K" class="tid_ico"> She's also been able to keep working away on PILGRED which was up to 31% before we even converted her and is now well on it's way.</p><p>Even so, with the first OPEN Mush log now in the open we need to move quickly and so when daychange comes, backed up by the fact that we're not going to be able to get a healthy and prepped away team ready anyway we return to resting positions and I take a bed in <em>BD</em> after extracting my fertile spore and washing (Still cautious of discover with no legitimate reason to be dirty), the new day and lack of action has given our converters plenty to rest and also new free spore for <strong><em>Gio</em></strong> and so they descend on <strong>Roland</strong> D9C1, and we welcome <strong><em>Roland</em></strong> to what is becoming a real dream for me and several of the other crew!</p><p><strong><em>And then we were nine <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> </em></strong></p><p>Only our dear new recruit <strong>Stephen Seagull</strong> remains together with our captive, yet gold, <strong>Chun</strong>.</p>

Here we are, Day 9, and we're 9 Mush, an average of 1 per day, despite the ship not starting until Day 3, a fortuitous combination of high level Mush, human errors, and quick strikes on the Mush hunters have meant that we're staring greatness in the face.</p><p>Returning to the bridge after my rest I stop by the <em>lab</em> to give another speech to our dear <strong>Chun</strong>, check and applaud <strong>Stephen</strong> for maintaining our new garden whilst he rests in the <em>medlab</em> and having the traditional love-in on the <em>bridge</em> between <strong><em>Paola</em></strong> and I, she's outright given up on reinstalling the camera, we discover that we're expecting a baby!</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/jinsu.png" alt=":mush_jin_su_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">To think... A mush/human hybrid... I'd heard about their possibility and that they existed but they were rare, very rare, the collective had noted that they had increased powers, and none of the limitations of converted humans. Naturally born with all their genome and influenced by growth they were hailed as the next generation of the Mush genome, leaders of our people to come... My heart raced but we still had a mission to attend to but my focus is now doubled on ensuring we find this promised land so that we can lure all of the remaining rebel forces to this would be haven, and once and for all extinguish the human race...</span></span></p><p>Both of our newest conversions are now awake and aware of their conversions, and with <strong><em>Roland</em></strong>'s conversion being visible on the crewbar we're now discussing <strong>Stephen</strong>, although it's seemingly difficult to get the newest recruits to understand that the ship already belongs to the Mush, all traditional Mush skill choices are now redundant and so ONLY <em>phagocyte</em> and <em>fertile</em> are worthwhile.</p><p>Also, a moral debate which started earlier on the ship is continuing, what to do with <strong>Stephen</strong>. New players are rare and must be embraced and made to enjoy and feel welcome in the game. To this end we have several voices who want to convert him so that he can be a part of the glorious whole and not an unwitting pawn. On the other hand I'm now very painfull reinforcing the potential greatness of what this ship could be, and so I would like to keep him human so that we have a kind of panic gauge, to measure <strong>Chun</strong> against. It would be unreliable but since <strong>Stephen</strong> would be able to keep himself topped up through fruit and other means, it would be the best we could hope for.</p><p>I do agree to the poor state of recruitment to the game though, and so agree that we shall convert <strong>Stephen</strong>, and I will simply devote myself to the sole duty of being an <em>astro</em> booster and giver of morale with my free phagocyte per day it would be a potential race between the 12 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico"> I could give per day (max) and the incoming storm of <em>panic attacks</em> for <strong>Chun</strong>.</p><p>Still high from our happy news, <strong><em>Paola</em></strong> and I move to bring <strong>Stephen</strong> to the fold, first I move in to give him his first tastes of spores while he still rests in the <em>medlab</em> and <strong><em>Paola</em></strong> follows me in to welcome <strong><em>Stephen</em></strong> to our numbers.</p><p>We've done it, the ship is ours there are no more threats, it's onwards to Eden or at the very least Sol with our crew of 10 Mush!</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>My side of the story won't be as long or as detailed as Enigma's but I just want to say one thing:</p><p>I have played on ships with Enigma before and I know that, if he's human, the Mushes rarely get to live more than 2 full days since selection.</p><p>I didn't feel like involving my On top of that, peopleseyself in any mush hunting so I picked Paola. I took care of hunters, did my comms work and, of course, kept a chat open with Enigma, watching quietly.&nbsp; Because both he and I know that I have a fiery personality, I did all I could to act oblivious to the fact that I'd figured he was Mush. So I gave him some random vague info on how I thought other people were Mush. I was waiting for two things: one, for him to make a mistake and two, for me to finish my comms work. I resorted to asking for all the missions instead, in an attempt to keep them out of the hands of the other mush.</p><p>When I came back on to see that I'd been converted, I was happy. I mean, fter the whole fiasco with Chao and Terence,&nbsp; the ship was overall quiet and boring and my comms work would have been finished in a couple of days' time. If they dOn top of that, everyone'idn't convert me, Enigma and I both know I would have gone on a killing spree, staring with him. Wouldn't have been the first time....</p><br><p>In any case, once everyone was converted, I did my best to help with PILGRED and heals and whatever else needed to be done. I was ALWAYS lacking AP as I never got to rest anymore. When Roland used Massive Mushification, I was gutted. Why would anyone play against their own team like that? On top of that, people's activity levels dropped too much. It was like most of them were just happy to be in the mush team but were not willing to work for Eden. We had a real chance yet the lack of activity took it from us.</p><p>Chun's death was the final blow for me. It came unexpectedly and I tried so very hard to get Enigma to wake up and take us to Sol, to no avail. When Chun died, I was deprived of AP and Frieda had used hers looking for the hacker kit which I had been holding for the past few days. In the end, we had to settle for being assassinated by NERON.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome,&nbsp; as far as Mush play goes, this was my best ship ever. I had a lot of fun and even found out that mushes can get pregnant. It was quite funny cause Jin didn't know Paola was pregnant until I announced it because, as Mush,&nbsp; neither of us got glory for it. It was even funier that it took me almost an entire cycle to even notice it myself.</p>

While I was human I thought Eleesha's newbie act was pretty suspicious, you're lucky I was first beta mush because after my conversion, there was simply no mush hunters left!</p>
