The mush (Paola and Jin Su, later Kuan Ti) were acting secretly for the most time of the ship, but on day 7 we managed to kill Jin Su because Chao saw his mush actions through torturing.<br>On day 8 our oxygen was quite low and we did search for a planet but then in the late evening the 2 remaining mush (Paola and Kuan Ti) mutated both, killed Chao and guarded the front corridor to prevent us from moving the ship.<br>We managed to kill them by the end of day 9 but did not find a planet with oxygen by this time.<br>On the next day I was really lucky discovering a planet with oxygen. Although I could analyse it only once because of AP we decided to go there, because we had no other choice with very less oxygen left. Unfortunately Gioele did die before we were able to start that expedition because we were at 0 oxygen.<br>At the next cycle we started the expo some minutes too late and then our estimated return was exactly the same time as the cycle change. We managed to gather 16 oxygen through that expo and Stephen who was participating with only 4 HP managed to survive, very lucky guy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> (it was really suprising that he started to talk at day 9 after he did not say anything during the entire ship, said he was very busy until that time)<br>So we returned and unfortunately I died because of the missing oxygen although we did return at the exactly same time as the cycle change :/ But at least some crew members should have managed it to survive until day 10.</p><p>Paola was playing mush quite good, although she did a mistake (pretending that she did only get 4 ap through eating a ration although she should have received 5 ap, used phagocyte instead and explaning it by a bug) but I did not have the heart to kill her because I was really trusting her until to that moment.<br>Also thanks to Hua, active and good pilot, Gioele, helped when he was needed and managed to kill the both mush, Ian, a new player but you did a quite good job with the gardening <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">, Roland who did kill many hunter and Finola and Chun for doing the researches, although the most of you could have been a bit more communicative <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hello Freida! Paola here. My first time as Mush and Paola to boot. It was really weird how it all worked out for the Mush. I spored 3 times at the beginning of day 2 and thought to myself "this is the one and only time you will pass for being dirty, they're going to murder you if you do it again". I spored eleesha once because she was alone in bridge with stephen, then saw the cat in the corridor, spored it and left it in the lab (in retrospect I should've saved the spores, as I thought sporing the cat meant he would keep infecting whoever touches him).</p><p>I had medlab bed alone for a while and Kuan Ti comes in and wants to do the thing, had to reciprocate otherwise it would look fishy, so I did it, transferring my last spore to him. On day 3 and 4, Jin Su had acquired 2 spores and there was an argument about Ian leaving the apron somewhere, I believe Icarus Bay. You all decided Kuan Ti should run down to Icarus to get it, and Jin Su intercepted him along the way and spored him twice in that time, converting him to Mush.</p><p>Also, the mistake you caught me in with the mismatch of AP was actually my lying to you about how much AP I actually had. Whenever I stated my AP, I always subtracted 4 and gave you that number, and I had forgot to account for the second rebel base I got, which gives an extra AP. So I actually had 5 AP at that time when I told you I had 1 AP, and thought that eating the ration would "give" me 4 AP, when really I should be at 6AP <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico">. When you told me to heal you 3 times, I was sweating bullets and came up with the bug thing as a last resort. You really got me there and I acted like a good crewmember for days after that! Hah.</p><p>I remember my other mistake was after I sexed with Kuan Ti, I posted it in public and it showed the default message "The lights turned off, da da da da", AND I also stupidly left in the part where it says "YOU HAVE GAINED ONE GLORY" <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/oups.gif" alt=":anim_oups:" class="tid_ico"> (Guessing this was for sporing Kuan, but wasn't sure). Eleesha saw this and immediately said "hmm.. got spored?" and I was sure I was going to die. I tried to bury that thread and everyone seemed to forget about it <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/sifflote.gif" alt=":-&quot;" class="tid_ico">. I saw a question in the Q&amp;A thread soon after, someone asking "Do Mush get glory for doing the thing?" and I knew that if it was Eleesha asking that, then she isn't too sure about me being Mush and I was off the hook for the time.</p><p>Then came crazy Chao, who went and murdered eleesha and some others. Bless you crazy Chao. You saved me but you were also so damn annoying, so I took great joy in killing you. I also got a kick out of Terrence's last words. "«I choose my own skills. No one forces me.»" <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I hope to see you in future ships Freida! I usually main Paola and love having a good Freida by my side, and I was pretty pissed that I got chosen as a Mush after plasma shields came up as a research choice on day 2.</p>

Besides I said that before alpha mush assigned!<br>However, after awhile someone said to give the medlab to Paola and Frieda, and since you didn't reply I just went around the dorms looking for spare beds and found none, then I resided in central corridor where soon got decapitated by Frieda.</p>

                <p>I'd like to explain my view on this.</p><p>First, I feel that my skill pick should be <em>fully based</em> on my choice. No one else should choose my skills for me. I definitely had no intention of <em>solely playing for my glory</em>. I feel that Terrence is more of a scrap recoverer than a technician. A technician has to constantly move around to dismantle and fix things. This counters his passive <em>especially since I couldn't get hold of the scooter</em>.</p><p>Look at it this way, a Hua pilot can do the same amount of work as a Terrence pilot, but a Hua technician definitely can do more work than a Terrence technician due to his passive. Even though it goes in the meta and lore that Terrence is a technician, no I do not think so. If you ask me, I'd rather have a Kuan Ti technician than a Terrence technician, and therefore I picked pilot. Unless you guys were so active and co-ordinated that you can wheel me here and there.. No I doubt so. No one even bothered to <span class="tid_strike">get me the scooter</span> tell me where the scooter is. <em>Next point.</em></p><p>I toy with the awesome kube on all my ships. Literally. At least before the assignment of mush, because I'm <strong>required to stay neutral</strong>. This is the most neutral thing to do, isn't it?</p><p>Now about the banana, yep I admit its my fault that I shouldn't have ate banana on day 1, but its my <em>only</em> fault, and if I'm not wrong I ate it <em>before the assignment of mush?</em>. If you killed me because I ate 1 banana then please give yourself a slap. Why don't you kill all the inactives for wasting so much AP? Or the guy who invested his AP into the wrong project, no?</p>

You're not <em>required</em> to stay neutral, but you are encouraged to do so before mush have been selected. Also, the purpose of this is to address ships that fill up very slowly, which so far I have yet to see or hear. Playing with the Kube is a waste of AP, and is often seen done by griefers who purposefully try to be non-productive, so I recommend you not do that since you can still do useful activities that would still be considered neutral play. In essence, don't worry about helping the humans since oftentimes mush can also take advantage of the help (killing hunters for example, depending on the mush strategy). The point of neutral play is so that we don't see a scenario where mush are selected when that humans have been given days to do a bunch of anti-mush research.</p>

I tried going to dorms but ran out of AP/MP for one cycle and in that cycle you decided to go to a dorm for whatever reason. Also, you didn't just eat a banana, you took a pill too.</p>

Even though it goes in the meta and lore that Terrence is a technician, no I do not think so. If you ask me, I'd rather have a Kuan Ti technician than a Terrence technician, and therefore I picked pilot. Unless you guys were so active and co-ordinated that you can wheel me here and there.. No I doubt so. No one even bothered to <span class="tid_strike">get me the scooter</span> tell me where the scooter is. <em>Next point.</em></cite><p>Wasn't on this ship, but just wanna say, Hua or Kuan having tech will not be the norm. It's a level 4 skill for both of them, so they'd need 255 exp invested in that character in order to have it as an option, and Hua at least would have to not be bronze in order for it to be a viable option. Most likely tech if Terrence isn't is Raluca but that still takes someone who's level 3 Raluca. Terrence is the only character who gets tech at level 2, so unless he knows for a fact that someone else has tech, I'd think he was mush for taking his level 3 skill instead of it on a ship with other pilots. Scooter can be found and gotten to him long before tons of things start breaking. If it isn't, you've most likely got bigger problems on your ship.</p>
