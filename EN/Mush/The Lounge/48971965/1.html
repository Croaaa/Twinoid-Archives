                <p>Original Janice here. I'll write something up later, but I do want to go on record and say the events of this ship are 100% because mycoscan never happened.</p><p>All three of the transfer victims had a starting spore that could have been dealt with via mycologist (since Ian mentioned he could take it), spore sucker or super soaper. It's far harder to pull enough spores to make conversions happen than it is to take advantage of existing spores. I hope the people that were against mycoscan at the start rethink their opinons. I'd have had a significantly harder time pulling anything off with 2ap spores 4 times a day with mycoscan than 4ap spores twice a day without mycoscan.</p><p>And I'm surprised no one caught Terrence's conversion. It was stupidly obvious... especially because he *tried* to get converted. (Which sits about as well with me as food tests do.)</p>

I assume KT was mush, getting dirty on purpose then volutarily pushing me to dorms <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/discrete.png" alt=":mush_chut:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">. No beds for me so I asked Janice to help me back in medlab <em>Was there for a whole day and Frieda had already spored me</em> and you guessed it.. spored me and that grumpy cat. Like an idiot I was low on morale, eating rations, Janice knew this since I told her on private chat, and so I reluctantly hugged the cat the next cycle. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Fast forwarding to D4C5 I needed to spend a few AP in order for myself as well as Janice and Frieda to maximize our plan on C8. Amazingly <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"> Plasma Shields was the next project, great cover to spend my ap on. No one suspected a thing.... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Our first plan was to rampage <em>Like all typical mushlings</em> and kill all who were in dorms. <em>Thank god for this season, at least a third of the crew already had a spore so transfering was so easy.</em> We wanted to convert Raluca to help us with our rampage but then Frieda pointed out Gioele had an extra spore changing our whole plan completely.</p><p>Half an hour before day change[D4C8], Janice wanted to rush <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_pilgred.png" alt=":mush_pa_pilgred:" class="tid_ico">pilgred and head for Sol. A terrific idea but risky at the same time. Not knowing whether the crew would be online or Ral would be on to help, we decided she needed to <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">transfer into her <em>who already had a spore</em> and rush pilgred. I could also <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">transfer in to <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/stephen.png" alt=":mush_stephen_50:" class="tid_ico">Steph <em>who also had a spore</em> for leverage/insurance to make sure we get it. <br><br>With enough AP, we managed to get 1 relay from Janice <em>and enough for her to change BIOS settings incase we kill anyone,shower, to use all ap</em> while I spent most of mine relaying with Raluca <em>who had tech and physicist</em> without having Steph for an extra relay. It was all going so well, pilgred finished <em>by me</em>, transfered into Steph killing Andie <em>almost got Hua who fled</em>... All we needed was <strong>Frieda</strong> to transfer into <strong>Gio</strong> to hit that big button home.</p>

I also noticed that Terrence was the person who entered Refectory next, that was probably the time he got spored/converted. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>when Janice mentioned that she was running around, looking for fires, I happily accepted that as an excuse, because it wasnt enough proof for me to justify killing our only shrink. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p></cite><p>You and Terrence. Christ. I was literally and only looking for the fire. You know... when we don't have fire detector, the fire could be literally anywhere and every single room has to be checked. I was silver. I had the fertile skill and eventually took transfer. I didn't even have the ability to trap rations - much less the desire to trap uncooked rations that would just get the spores cooked out of them.</p><p>When there's a fire and a person runs around (and names every room they went into) and accurately claims where a fire is or is not and doesn't get dirty doing it... it's probably not suspicious.</p><br><p>As for the mush conversion story, Terrence has it close to right, but not quite.</p><p>Frieda and I were the alphas and were discussing an overall strategy. Toward the end of the first day as mush, I see a notification in mush channel that Terrence now has a spore and Frieda saying that Terrence is the first target. Awesome, we can work with that. He's a tech so easy as hell to get dirty and cover some AP use with failed teching, right?</p><p>Some time later, Terrence asks in main chat for comforting... which confused the hell outta me because he should have been around 7-8 ap plus some because I knew he spent a few cycles in a bed with me in the room. So I pm'd him to ask what his morale was at and how badly he needed it because if my calculations were correct, Raluca should have been around 4 morale at that point and was about to be screaming for comfort. And I didn't want to waste precious AP. (I was mush, of course I didn't want to comfort Raluca without her asking... I was too busy planting seeds with others that it was fishy as hell that she hadn't asked yet... and if I were human I probably would have been leading a charge to kill her.) So I mentioned to Terrence that if it's ok with him, I'd rather hold off. That I knew Raluca was low and hell, I was about to go down to 5 at the next cycle change (which was day change) and figured I wasn't the only one. (Yes, I keep track of morale when I'm mush and will make up panic attacks later in the ship.) So Terrence suggested running off to medlab to DTT - which I really really really wanted to do because I'm sitting there holding two spores, but it would have been fishy as hell so I declined, telling him that I was suspicious of mush. He asked if I'd cuddled the cat and the lightbulb went off. Nope, I sure hadn't. So just as I was about to head off to do that, I realized medlab was wide open and offering to escort Terrence there for a bed and to save MP was a pretty damned good excuse to slip a spore in him. So that's what I did. I got him on the way up to medlab then went to give schrodie a nice little spore.</p><p>Turns out that Terrence was pretty much trying to be converted. Not a strategy I like or endorse, but it worked for us in the end.</p><p>Toward the end of day 5, Terrence had suggested a rampage that included converting Raluca. I'm not a huge fan of rampages, but the ship was full of "once a day" type players (which isn't bad, just not what I wanted to be on) that weren't doing a lot so I was bored and ready to be off the ship and kinda went with it. I was never overly fond of converting Raluca because it'd either be kinda shitty to say "Hi Raluca, welcome to mush, now you have to rampage with us" or it'd be stupid obvious that we killed just about everyone in the dorms and left Raluca sitting there untouched. Gee, wonder if she might have been converted! So we were pondering ways to make things work when Frieda reminded us about Gio's spore and pilgred rush possibilities. I liked that idea <strong>much</strong> more since it's an affirmative win rather than just "fuck shit up and hope for the best".</p><p>I spent a lot of time AP and HP planning and making sure I'd leave Janice's body with nothing particularly helpful for getting around the ship. Then it was go-time. I went through engine room, pushed pilgred, hid my trackie (yes, hid... I needed to waste an AP), went up to AD and showered twice without the soap (4ap and 8hp wasted), went into Nexus and change food destruction to on, locked research, turned death announcements off and put the priority to nothing then back to BD with just 1mp left to claim my new body.</p><p>Raluca was active and noticed what was going on, but with no trackie and no way to reach it, there was nothing she could do. Her only dorm buddy was the very inactive Derek and the only person 1mp away was the also inactive Stephen. So once Terrence and I finished PILGRED, we found the new Janice in RC. Once cycle change hit, she got to refectory to mow down some food to get some health/ap. Her doing that almost ended our mush plan... but it seems I'm not the only one that derps. (We'll get there)</p><p>Once PILGRED was done, Frieda closed our mushy PM tab and transferred into Gioele to take us home... only to find out that he only had 1ap. We all completely missed the fact that Gio had just announced last cycle that he was out of AP... and with (I shit you not) no less than 5 people standing at the bridge, he didn't get Paola's logistics point.</p><p>So I went to invite our mushy commander back into the mush PM tab... and I done derped. I invited the new Frieda instead of the new Gioele. At least at that point, everything in that thread (other than the possible rampage scenario) was already well known among anyone awake. Stephen was suddenly talking, the new Janice and Frieda both making it known they had been body swapped and having the skills (or lack thereof) to prove it. <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/Rbuf2jg.png">So I went with it.</a> It was Frieda that added all the new folks, but I did eventually add Ian on my own because casting friend and he deserved to see the fun, too.</p><p>In the meantime, the humans ALMOST succeeded in blocking our plans. Ian was guarding FC and Janice had declared a ceasefire there so Stephen couldn't push Ian out of the room to get by. They killed Gioele and knowing that Stephen was still next on the commander list, they hatched some good plans that didn't quite work.</p><p>Janice left and went to the bridge, not realizing that if she left, ceasefire was over. Ian left FC to let people through so they could eat and go kill Stephen. If they succeeded with that, commandership would have gone back to Frieda - our old Gioele. Had they succeeded in killing Stephen, we'd have been dead in the water.</p><p>After Stephen had a little fun in AD killing Andie with two punches and almost getting killed himself, he finally ran up to bridge, apprenticed Janice's diplomat skill, punched Paola off the sofa, declared a ceasefire and waited for the next cycle to change. That was the point they realized they couldn't do anything about it and prepared for the end.</p><p>After cycle change when I had two more AP, I ran up to refectory and wanted to try to solve the kube with no such luck. Stephen offered a mission to anyone that wanted it before returning us so I claimed it for kube solving. Lots of people decided to chime in that I'd never be able to do it... and I never did, but I found other things to use my new AP on. Chun had come into refectory with the knife and a few leftover AP from their failed attempt to kill Stephen and on her last attack, dropped the knife. I saw it in the shelf as I picked up mad kube and cursed the lag as I tried to drop the wrench and pick up the knife. I got it before she could get it back and decided to have some fun stabbing Chun. I only landed one stab, though. But it was a satisfying stab.</p>

                <p>Original Gioele here, later Frieda. Chun is kinda almost right, the thing is the plan would have worked fine if we both had good connections. But that's how the cookie crumbles I guess. Anyway I also noticed the Terrence getting pushed, I just thought it was being taken care of in the private chats.</p><p>Guess assuming others will get things done is risky business.</p>
