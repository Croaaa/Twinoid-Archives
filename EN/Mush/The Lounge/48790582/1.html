Was even going to ask, but dropped the idia because I don't believe in coincidences <strong>that</strong> much (we once were on same ship already, with an adorable newbie Gioelle, whom we took back on Sol, together with our mush baby).</p><p>Btw the whole move was quite risky - if Hua hadn't come online in time, Chun+Derek+Paola could've killed you (not sure they could also be fast enough to kill Hua since they didn't know she was mush too, though), fixed Pilgred (Chun had a tech book - not sure if I told you, probably only Hua knew) and thus win. Actually, that was what I was hoping would happen since I was dreaming of all the "Wuuuuut?!" + "Hoorah! We finally made it to Sol!" end messages and imagining all the shoked faces after they see you two really were mush all this time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> So when I saw discussion about inability of guarding FC, I gulped, and when 4 death messages appeared, I nearly exploded (like: HE PROMISSED IN MY FACE!!!), flipped the table and was furiously grumbling about how everything went wrong to my friends the rest of the day <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> (btw I was more expecting Hua to rampage after she gains enough ap)<br>Now my perfect story about Andie, who saved the ship by cost of his own life, delivering it to Sol intact and with all the humans still alive and ready to open their eyes to the True Light will never see the world <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> But anyway, I have another one to come, soooo..</p>

She couldn't kill me and she would die quickly with her morale. Paola was tired too... So just left Derek, and he was already seriously injured. I know you prefer go back to Sol, you already saved our ship when you was Jin Su, but... I hate do nothing when I'm Mush. I feel cheating. If the human have no chance to guess some Mush left, it isn't amusing and the researches too much progress to infect somebody.</p>

                <p>I personally don't like playing the long game as Mush unless it's the only way to win. The ships where I have infected Sol were where the Mush were able to drag the humans to Sol quickly. Besides, the longer a ship lasts, the harder it is for Mush to pretend they're human. You may not know this, but after you were killed, the Mush hunt chat were doubtful that all the Mush were gone. They were even considering making Roland do a food test to ensure he hadn't been converted.</p>

And you didn't have many active people who could stack ap for scanning + you had fuel for only 1 more expo, most likely. Fuel expo would've also reduced the chances of finding o2 planet soon, since you had to deal with launching, healing, probably re-launching, maybe losing someone in MIA forever, checking spores level and moving the ship.

Good to know you had what it took Andie,<br>I really like playing the long game too, but unfortunately I miscalculated my AP on the first spore and immediately doomed myself. I still managed to shrug you guys off for a while but I had to take my nightly leave and since I was unsure if I'd get lynched through the night or not, I just grabbed random stuff and zapped off.

                <p>Ok. So here comes the story (I might be messing up some details - it's been quite a while since the ship ended - feel free to correct me if so (and sorry for a delay - was too busy irl)).</p><p>When I saw my selection choises, with Andie among others, I decided, a nice relaxed ship as them would be just what the doctor ordered (especially concidering I was still on my vacation and work promissed to be intence after I returned).</p><p>So I wake up on a not very active, but still quite alive ship, that had about 5 people awake by the time I joined. It even had some cameras already installed - half of the win achieved, yei! I did some neutrall stuff like planting, moving some objects and shooting down remaining hunters, then installed a camera in AD and fell asleep (Chun was having a medlab bed).<br>Ship filled pretty fast and as my plane irl has landed, I got the welcoming to mush message. Well, I'm always excited with it, since I almost never end up being alpha (as well as beta <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> ), but in <strong>that</strong> body, seriously?! <br>So yes, I was an alpha mush Andie on a ship with 5 cameras (Gioelle woke up, posted several messages, installed his paranoid cams... and never came back.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> ) and quite a few gold and experienced players.</p><p><strong>PART 1. How Andie became an orphan</strong></p><p>I got myself Janice as a partner. Wasn't sure how active she'd be, but she has made some threads and seemed sane, which already looked promissing.<br>I made up coupla offhand scenarios, most of them included my dead body since I had a low level (no infector.. and moreover - no defacer on a ship with 5 cams, eh.. also only 2 people had a starting spore, one was inaclive Gioelle and 2nd one was Terrence, who was constantly hanging out in Nexus with camera, making convertion too obvious), which I shared with my partner. The best option to go with was me, taking off the camera and converting on daychange with help of my partner: that would reveal me, but she'll still be able to lay low. And with newborn beta they might do some more shenanigans.<br>But this still was a bit iffy - if people will notice her being online during the process - she's screwed. Plus I was going to convert KT - he was the most active, gold and useful (and he always ruined half of my plans by his actions later, hehe) and he was mostly active during daychange and could make noise and ruin the whole thing. After convertion I planned to transfer to Hua or another pilot and kill my old body. That should've stalled the research and reduced the time for detective games, forcing Pilgred repairs to be done sooner).<br>Anyway, plan wasn't very reliable, so I decided to go with another one: contaminating an AP pill with Janice's help (I had no excuses for being dirty and my ap was to easy to track), and then switch to the first plan. The chances of the pill to be eaten were quite high, plus I could use Janice's help to gently remind about it's existance when humans will be trying to kill my doomed body and will need some ap boost.</p><p>But, alas, we didn't get the chance to try out that one, because Janice miscountered ap while extracting a spore (probably didn't notice CS was already finished, though I'm almost sure I've warned aboout that), probably to impatient to wait and work out the proper teamwork plan. <br>Btw: CS was rushed in the first day even without my participance, which made my chances to extract not being noticed too low to even try).<br>She hasn't reported being dirty and the reasons she gave after inevitable interrogation were to suspecious to believe them (flu during the cyclechange, which she hadn't noticed at first and now it cured on it's own) + she was lacking hp after she finally showered. I was discussing Janice's suspecious behaviour in a PM with KT, who planned to check her with medikit. So I warned her she needs to act before he does, but she was almost out of ap and hoped to get clean out of this situation. Luckily, KT didn't have ap to heal her and confirm she's lacking more than 2 hp, so we had some more time. But not much, since anybody first to be awake would've done that.</p><p>So I tried to convince Janice to help me with infecting the pill, but she didn't like the plan from the beginning and prefered to lay low, hoping, suspecions will evaporate with time or that she'll get more ap to act - I didn't quite get that. But since she was going to be afk till c7 of the next day, the chances she would return to an end page were too high, so we finally agreed about the suiside mission: she had to <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/Hq2yeUJ.png">flee in a Pasiphae</a> with an Apron, which would've given me a free hand, and take some other useful stuff (iirc, it was mush sample - we didn't know Paola already decoded it's substitute since she never reported Xyloph progress, and a Nexus camera, which left Terrence with 1 spore unprotected, but he noticed that and moved to the dorm too quick to make it count).</p><p>While Janice was hanging in outer space, the crew was thinking about rushing comms and finishing projects, hoping for MN to be the next one (except for Frieda, who found it safer to drop her off asap a safer option). Comms fell short of expectation, so project was the last hope. I must note that we were planning an o2 expedition before this happened, the fuel was already in. So when commander Seagull woke up, he missed the part about mush, fleeing in pasiphae and just moved us to a planet. The project was finished next cycle and one of 3 next options was MN <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Haha #1</p><p>(Part 2 and 3 will follow soon, and I'll try to be shorter)</p>

                <p>I was really upset because I actually wanted to try out Janice as a human and it seemed like such a nice crew as well. But work is work, with one ap to wash up I managed through two cycles before Hua would notice I was dirty. In my last ship, I actually communicated a disease before going to bed, and when I came back I was dead. I checked the logs and apparently the disease had gone off in two cycles and when someone tried to heal me, they couldn't see the disease, so it was a good excuse, but with three cycles before my next visit and Hua and Kuan on my heels, I preferred to wing it.<br>Andie's plans were good in theory, but they were too sketchy for me.<br>Can't wait to know how you managed to got converting though.</p>
