                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1717">This game</a> is now over.<br>I was Chun. Things were going swimmingly for a while, although people did accuse Raulca of being mush for showering once, even though two cycles ago she said she was planning on showering in two cycles. Turns out she didn't know how morale loss worked and thought she would lose morale every cycle for being dirty. <br>Anyway, aside from that, the mush accusations were pretty sparse, so me and Finola did tag-team on research to get antispore and Mycoscan done quickly. However, I told the commander to move the ship so we wouldn't suffocate, leading to Hua's accidental demise, as she was outside the ship. After this, however, Neron reported THREE things broken in the status bar. One of them was a turret, which I believe was reported earlier. The other was seemingly the lack of a patrol ship, which we obviously couldn't just fix. We never really found out what the third one was, I think.<br>ell, I went around to try and figure out what was happening, and eventually stopped in a dorm with Janice in it to regain Morale. However, Chao suddenly started attacking me while I was sleeping. When I logged back on, I was still alive, but weakened. I reported the attack, and Kuan Ti came in and started attacking him, with me putting in the finishing blow. After that, I checked the room logs and realized Eleesha had thrown a grenade and taken out Ian to prepare for the attack, and me and Finola took her out as well, revealing her as an anonymush. The third mush (Paola) then went after me and killed me while I was out of points. <br>Not sure what happened after that, but apparently Pilgred was finished, Paola was killed, and we made it back to Sol!</p>
