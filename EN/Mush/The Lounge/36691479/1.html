Told jin su where he can find food since he were hungry . Did not expect him to become idle in a crucial moment ... <br>Came back 1 min b4 cycle chance and guess what ... Had 4 AP and some MP . Grabbed hacker kit and ran to the bridge ASAP , but came there with like 12 sec left . Pushed hack and it succeeded in 1rst try , pushed leave orbit and then .... cycle changed b4 ive managed to confirm ..<br><strong>ARE YOU SURE</strong> killed us ... really such a dissapointing end when we still had over 20 02 and over 20 HC . Should have just pushed back to sol since it has no "are you sure" confirm button ...<br>Should have checked in earlier ... Jin Su where did you go dammit ..... We were hit by 2 full HP asteroids btw and we had no plasma shield even thought this ship was great ...</p><p>Mush situation : So ive found both mush (1 were active , 1 inactive) . But stephen fell under alarm either way around at the same time i found out that he were mush . <br>And he have turned Finola into mush it seems (had no idea even thought saw her being spiked twice under alarm) , but she did not play against humans <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> So that's why stephen picked anonymous and Finola did the same <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Well i were looking forward to day 15 with this crew , but we somehow got killed by asteroids . Stupid end for a decent ship . Wish i would have made print screen while pushing leave orbit &gt; confirm button , but weren't thinking about Print screens at that time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Oh man this was one heck of a trip. I don't even know where to begin. I was your one and only , the sexy Hua on that ship. I mostly spent my time trying to pull the crew together and chatting up <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> paola <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> since we had met in an earlier ship which most of you probably know about. The MMM mush rush.</p><p>We had a mostly active ship with only raluca,terrence and frieda who were inactive but the ones who were active were all awesome. We all had our suspects of who was mush but I doubt anybody expected finola to end up being mush. I think the investigation crew, which was lead by Janice was a bit sloppy though cause I wasn't really participating in the hunt and ended up discovering the mush at just the right time. Ironically at that moment , I had dropped my I-trackie since I was moving stuff around and if I didn't jump in with Paola we wouldn't have caught stephen in time. You wouldn't believe my worry when I had no way to communicate the discovery of a mush until I remembered paola's account and sent her a private message. Meanwhile I was stuck in the corridor watching each second tick by for the cycle to change just so I can get back in the dorm and check up on the situation.</p><p>We had a few of newbies too, Ian , raluca and chao (possibly roland) were new to the game. Raluca didn't do much besides ask a bit about her role and then retreat to engine room where the evil ZZZ of inactivity slowly crept over her. Chao on the other hand was really active and willing to shoot everything in site, we had to make sure he kept the guns in his pockets until we really needed them. Ian was my main suspect for mush, especially after the last game I had. He didn't talk much and I could've sworn he was going to pull a ' Guys, I can't deal with watering the plants so can you please adopt them for me' like the other Ian did. Especially since I had to do his job for days 1-4 with my free actions. Seriously, I was the one who planted the bananas into the 3 hydropots we had and tended to the adult plants for those few days and you wouldn't believe how many times I wanted to kill him.(I probably would have if paola didn't keep me calm) Lastly we have roland. I doubt we would've lasted as long as we did if it wasn't for him considering all my points were tied up into other things. Between watering the plants, participating in projects and doing repairs I didn't have much AP to spare to shoot down hunters.</p><p>Moving on to the projects. I noticed we had a lack of technicians so I had to reluctantly level my hua up to level 4 in order to help with the projects and while we did pick the best options every time, I really disagreed with Kuan Ti with some of them. He seemed to failed to notice that we didn't have a lot of people who can spend their points towards projects and kept going for the ones that took the most time and might have possibly denied us the plasma shields since it had yet to show up. You know something is wrong when paola is getting more projects done by upgrading neron than the whole project team which consisted of mostly 3 people.</p><p>Lastly out of the whole crew I think Paola was our best player, she single handedly decoded all of the Xyloph Databases, established contact with most of the bases and upgraded neron 3/4 times. All of this was done while scanning planets in between too. If anyone deserves an MVP award for this ship it should be her.</p><p>It's a real shame to come back and see our ship get destroyed in such a silly way. We had pilgred finished and could have easily returned to sol at any time so going out this way is just insulting.</p><p>Sexy Hua over and out.</p>

                <p>No worries , when mush picked anonymous only conclusion i had were - Stephen is mush and he may have did it since he either turned Finola into mush or Panic since he were caught by alarm . It was around the same time Finola got spiked twice so did not really make a difference even thought i did not saw log of medlab . Gave up on looking at finola since she remaining clean 24/7 and kept on working at Lab . She was highly suspected and i bet that my claim after stephen died she panicked and did human stuff only . <br>If i remember i said : Finola you have no reason to get dirty . Use apron while eating and stay away from shower unless you want to die . (said something similliar at lab thread) .</p>

                <p>Sexy Hua, you give me too much credit! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>What a sad way to go. We had 02, fuel, pilgred and active players. We perhaps relaxed a wee bit too much. I purposefully jumped with *sexy Hua* from a previous ship that ended too soon, and continued to enjoy <span class="tid_user tid_user_7667088 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7667088">magekirbys</span> company. You were fantastic. Having <span class="tid_user tid_user_12903 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="12903">Darjus</span> worry about the mush hunt gave me more time to work on comms. <strong>Chao</strong> certainly was an <em>excellent</em> newbie, doing well for both action and roleplay. He was like and adorable, murderous puppy. "Can I kill something? Can I?" <strong>Ian</strong>, thanks for the coffee, and for going gold later in the game. I did appreciate it. Jin Su, KT, Roland, Eleesha ... everyone who played. You all did well as well.</p>
