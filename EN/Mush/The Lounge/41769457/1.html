I wasted a bunch of AP in the beginning getting my bearings, but once Terrence began to help me I really got into the swing of things. We got REALLY lucky with NERON projects, though; With the amount of damage that had begun to occur from hunters and such, Plasma Shield/GPU was amazing.

                <p>Hi, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"> <em><strong>Chun</strong></em> there! It was an awesome ship. Although no RP, it was really hostile system on this ship and difficult to survive.</p><p>Mush time - investigation:<br>I wanted to troll, so pretended to be Nurse. Terrence got disappointed because of this, and because of this I wanted him to help me with Mush-hunt. I got knife and hacker kit and hid them. I also took plastenite armor with myself, but no grenade. Checked radio, Grenade still in one of storages. I didn't want to find it. I let it lie where it was. I was whole the time in the Lab. Terrence was in Bravo Dorm and looked at people entering there. The shower in Alpha Dorm was dismantled before Mush selection, so I'd know who would infect people. But Gioele was inactive and no additional cameras, so I looked at people entering there, becuase there were some people beside me. Paola entered first, 2 times. At first time she took apron, at second - dropped it. I asked Terrence if she had visited Bravo Dorm. Result: Negative, so no infection, so she's got out of my suspicion. Janice tried to find Mush Sample. She visited Lab twice, so she could check if there was no camera, but she was walking around the ship and found Mush Sample in Central Corridor and took it in the Lab. She could sneaky infect anybody. Terrence reported she visited Bravo Dorm after all. I wanted Eleesha to check corridors if Janice said truth about visiting almost every room in this ship, but she was inactive.<br>Frieda found a planet without oxygen, but lots of fuel. Paola wanted to visit it asap, but I held crew until we got MycoAlarms to secure Icarus Bay, but Paola wanted reach the planet quick. She pointed out that we didn't make any research. Ian wanted some research, but I was waiting for Andie. A few cycle later, Paola convinced crew to visit the planet, Hua put the fuel getting dirty, and Jin Su moved this ship. I promised myself to kill somebody when we'd be on this planet. I was blind for everyone except Hua, who finally forced us to reach this planet. I told Terrence she was a Mush, he also suspected her, but he wanted proof, so I asked about piloting and projects. She didn't do anything, she just put some fuel, found the mage book and grenade (yeah, suspicious for me that she visited some storages) and complained about her morale. I convinced Terrence to attack him and I finished with Hua. Meanwhile, Andie got back and instead of helping with research, closed my tab with research team and went piloting, shooting and scavenging. There was just 1 hunter. Cycle later, I checked this. Alpha Bay - he/she didn't take Patrol Ship, Alpha Bay 2, he/she took a ship, a noticed the Patrol Ship had 9 of 10 charges (he/she used 2AP to shoot the hunter, 1 charge loaded in cycle change. No scraps in inventory. Janice also suspected him/her. I told her that Andie was dead. I ordered Derek to kill Andie, and he attempted to kill him/her, but got exhausted. Janice with 1 hit finished with Andie. Janice asks if Eleesha could print the LIST. If Eleesha couldn't, it meant no Mush there. I told she couldn't because she was inactive. It was good reason, said Kuan Ti. <a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/HSbX0g/287">[Origin]</a></p><p>Death queue:<br><strong>Stephen</strong> - got killed because of attempting to kill... Ian. Simply griefer.<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Hua</strong> - good blablabla, looked experienced, but I was angry because of my ships in the past that nobody listened to me about Mush hunt, and decided to kill her. Hua was unlucky that she's got picked as Mush and I was there.<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Andie</strong> - got killed very easily.<br><strong>Eleesha</strong> - was inactive and starved to death<br>But following deaths wasn't expected as the ones above:<br><strong>Gioele</strong> - was inactive, survived day 6, but Terrence finished with him because he was alive. Terrence wanted to clear this room to do you-know-what. He also suspected him as Mush who went idling and would go rampage in the middle of game. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Who did he kill Gioele? Because he was durable.<br><strong>Jin Su</strong> - he was very active in his first days, but suddenly got inactive. Because of him we were in trouble, because wave of 30 hunters damaged our ship so much in 2 cycles. And he lost title, and starved.<br><strong>Frieda</strong> - very active in her first days, but later she was very quiet. As commander she wasn't moving Daedalus despite the big waves of hunter returned, just scanning. She even didn't answer in our questions. Suddenly, the fire was put and she burned. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> Really unexpected!<br><strong>Derek</strong> - got much damage in expedition because of lots of fights (Diplomat would be really useful, or survivalist at least, Hua had been already killed), survived with 1<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">, died in the next cycle change.<br><strong>Roland</strong> - unlucky explorer. We've got a Starmap Fragment, but lost him.<br><strong>Raluca</strong> - she was really quiet. She didn't report any depression, and suddenly killed herself.</p><p>In memory: Derek and Roland.<br>PS. Yeah, your icons are the only ones which I haven't got.
