It took a little while to get the story sorted in my head but it's funny how just people can cause such disaster on board a ship. In this case a Jin Su with a strong desire for adventure as well as a persecution complex, a griefer Paola and two mush able to capitalise on their disruption of the crew.</p><p>Our story begins D1C1:<br>Paola is first aboard. She immediately hides the soap and apron then "remembers" where they are as soon as mush are selected. <br>At this time she establishes the comm link and pumps out the Neron upgrade "Magnetic Return" and gets 46% of the way through the next upgrade.</p><p>Time passes, a few crew members work on organising the ship. Jin Su pushes for early expeditions. Could be mush wanting to strand half the crew, could be the captain being a good organiser, could just be someone who likes going on expeditions.</p><p>Meanwhile, we note that we now have 4 idle crew members. Eleesha finished the tutorial, spoke to us a few times but never left the bridge. Freida, Ian and Terrence are all idle in the lab.</p><p>Since we have no active astrogators, I (Janice) get volunteered for the job despite not having the skill. Huzzah! I wasn't planning on spending that ap on anything anyway.<br>I begin scanning a planet, then I'm forced to move to B-dorm thanks to inactive Eleesha leaching Paula logistics.</p><p>D2C8:<br>First Ian then Freida both come to B-dorm. Freida grabs a bed. Neither says a word to anyone. Ian stands in the corner and stares at me with his cold dead eyes.<br>I immediately call a few active players I'm fairly sure aren't mush (Finola, Stephen, Chun) and tell them we have two potential mush.</p>

                <p>D3C1:<br>Day 3 Rebel signal arrives.<br> <br>I head to the bridge to finish my planet scan. Along the way I notice Ian and Freida went straight from the lab to B-dorm.<br>I pop into the lab and check the logs. Sure enough, both of them were registered as inactive (so full ap) and neither did any gardening or lab work.</p><p>What possible reason could two people with full ap have for needing a bed in B-Dorm? Could it be that's the only room with a shower in it?</p><p>I call the scooby gang.</p><p>The last thing we want to do is start a fight with Mush Ian and Freida in the same room when they have 9 or 10 :pa: on them and 2 spores. Especially in cycle 8 when we may fail to kill them and then let them convert one of us over the day change. Add the possibility of them sporing 4 people then transferring and we could be in serious trouble.</p><p>We decide to seperate them if possible and to also try to get at least one to spend all their ap.</p><p>We consider bringing more people in on the mush hunt, but then consider the possibility that one of the two isn't mush and potentially tipping the other off. We decide to keep our suspicions to ourselves for the time being.</p><p>Then I make an announcement that since Freida hasn't scanned any planets and is using a bed in B-dorm that anyone who needs to should feel free to kick her off the bed. Preferably with a knife or blaster.</p><p>She falls for the ploy and 15 minutes later rush to the bridge, finds a planet and analyzes it three times. She doesn't post the results.</p><p>So now we have her reading our messages and responding to them and she just spent exactly 8 ap, which is exactly what she should have if she spored twice had a sneaky shower then slept a cycle.<br>We make preparations to kill her as we have the ap to do it.</p>

                <p>D3C2:<br>A quick check shows that no more comms has been downloaded since day 1, that paola has been sleeping on her couch since then and that she has looked at the comms panel each cycle for the last 2.</p><p>She's clearly aware the D3 signal is there, is online and has full ap. We remember she hid items before play began (and only revealed them after we threatened to report her). We decide she is a griefer.</p><p>D3C3:<br>Paola again looks at comms panel but no progress is made.</p><p>So who do we kill? Freida is mush but has no ap and probably thinks her cover is ok. On the other hand if we kill Paola, Stephen will be comms officer in the next cycle and we can get the signal. We decide to kill Paola first.</p><p>A few stabs later we explain to the crew our reasons for murdering her, we tell them Stephen will be comms at the start of the next cycle and will download the rebel signal.</p><p>At this point everything fell apart...</p>

                <p>Jin Su complains that we have formed a secret cabal and are murdering people without cause.<br>He also notes I've finished scanning the planet and heads to the bridge and moves the ship 5 minutes before the cycle change.</p><p>We ask why he lost the rebel signal when we had just explained that if he waited for 5 minutes we could have had the signal downloaded.</p><p>He responds by calling me Himmler and accuses me and Stephen of plotting against him and the crew. Then he starts trying to convince people to prepare to head down to the planet.</p><p>At this point we are flabbergasted. Is Jin Su the second mush? He's been pushing for expeditions since the ship started. I tell everyone to not hop on the Icarus unless Jin Su is aboard and Chun has the hacking kit.</p><p>Jin Su asks Chun if she has the hacking kit and she says she doesn't have it.<br>We tell everyone to wait till Chun grabs the kit (which will be conveniently after we finish killing Freida and Ian).</p><p>Jin Su again makes a speech about me being a dictator and that he'll do what he wants. I'm now convinced I was wrong all along and that Jin Su is mush not Ian.</p><p>He convinces both our other pilots (yes, all three pilots on the same expedition) and Kuan ti to ignore us and launch the mission.</p><p>I'm sure at this point you all see where this is headed.</p><p>They launch despite our protests and 15 minutes later Ian grabs the scooter, dashes to the hacking kit, hacks command and moves the ship.</p><p>I may have said some unkind things about Jin Su then. It's not a total loss. Paola's single act in aid of the crew has meant the Icarus is back on board with a holographic tv.</p><p>There followed an epic struggle with the 6 remaining crew members managing to slay the two mush, get pilgred to 92% completion only to die when 18 hunters showed up with no pilots on board. Naturally, if we'd been getting 5ap per ration we would have had enough ap to finish pilgred and return home.</p><p>Amazing how one person can cause so much damage.</p>
