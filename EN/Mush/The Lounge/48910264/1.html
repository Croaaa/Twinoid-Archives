                <p>That's not telling of a story though. <br>I will try a better attempt (before I forget even more details ^^).</p><p>I want to say something about each character first though:</p><br><p>Our ship started already promising and with a good activity. development of antimush research was ok. Our starting planet had already crystalite I think and we explored it quickly. <br>Here it could be easily seeen that Jin was a masochist, who did not bother to say that he is not at full health and because of misfortunes he mostly survived every expedition he took part in only with very few amount of health left. <br>Actually a fitting ending for him would have been to die on one of such expeditions. <br>Now to mush hunting:<br>In beginning I noticed that Raluca took the knife and the scooter so I contacted her. I didn't find it that suspicious since I often do that when I am human too. She gave me the scooter back and told some paranoid worries about other crew members.<br>This convinced me to trust her for now. <br>So I typed her something like: "I will invite some confirmed humans here to start a mush hunt channel here." The funny thing was, just after I seent it, she typed in a suspicion about another crew member which just doesn't seem true (something like: " I don't like Jin escorting Gioele to dorm and getting dirty afterwards." While Jin didn't get dirty afterwards. strange...I asked again about it and she answered something different, that she didn't believe that the escorting of Gioele was making any sense and was therefore strange. Which was true, it didn't make sense... well, good for her, I invited the confirmed humans afterwards into the channel then and we get to know the location of the knife.<br>Many people stayed fully clean here, including Raluca and we also got rather quickly some confirmed humans I think. Either illness or xyloph, one food proof. <br>At the point of the food proof where Paola just drank the coffes in lab with apron to do her job it was already from a psychological perspective kind of clear that Andie was mush given how frustrated he sounded about it. <br>Also he seemed to be frustrated that we thought he is mush.<br>This made me kind of suspoicious back then too. Why did he got that strong believe, I wanted him to research that spore sucker before visitting the next planet with crystalite and mentioned that he shoudl have plenty aps for it, not more and not less I think. <br>I guess also here I should have been more suspicious how he got that strong believe.</p><p>Anyway, after spore sucker was finished and every participating crew member used it (while Andie first said that he needs someone to heal him after using spore sucker and after some moments that he actually self healed in medlab on his way to IB. Raluca was in mean time holding onto the meditkit in Rear bravo storage, but noone paid much attention to it.).<br>I was curious to see what happens in Icarus bay and whether the muhes would use this opportunity for something.<br>So we went to this expedition and...crystalite was mush trap! Ok..It seemed pretty dangerous now. In the confirmed channel many people like Terrence, Gioele and Stephen were active and wanted to kill Andie better directly after expedition. <br>To me it was kind of tense when I noticed that more and more bad events happened during that expedition to me. In the end I had only 3 hp, even 1 hp less than masochist Jin Su. So i escaped as quickly as possible from IB. But that hurry wasn't necessary. Andie seemed to be offline and was killed without any trouble.</p><p>Not a long while later it seemed that Raluca was idling in FAT and then a message appeared that she died of starvation. I thought she died in FAT, but later I saw that she actually died at bridge of starvation.<br>It was strange, but she also was rather quietly lately and seemed to not have used that much time in mush and the time seemed right it was exactly the time when people would die of starvation..so we didn't wasted too many thoughts about it.</p><p>With the one mush Andie dead we planned to doteh cure and get the last mush with it. <br>The last mush...seemed to be difficult to find. I suspected Ian most since he go dirty becaus eof forgetting apron a while ago and stayed dirty afterwards for a rather long time before showering and..well, there was not more about it. Our second suspect was Hua. But only because she was rather inactive while she seemed to be more active before mush selection (she really wrote very many messages and wrote that she was hoping for an active crew..but when she got it, she went quiet and rather inactive).<br>Terrence suggested to trick Ian somehow into eating one of the spoiled rations we had to improve our knowledge.<br>I used a great opportunity, I asked Ian whether he has aps and whether I shoudl bring himm a ration so we can work on a research together. He agreed and so I thought it will be easy to trick him into it. He really ate it, reported about having food poisoning, but when I suggested him after the research to heal him in medlab he said he has to go off, but will finish research first... And so our nice trick lead only to inconclusive results.<br>We didn't want to just kick Ian and heal him (would have been too easy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">, but especially rather too forceful for my taste).<br>I dunno what we would have made with these inconclusive informations, if my plan B wouldn't have worked. Since we were rather sure that the mushes weren't able to convert someone I planned to print the list and give it a lucky shot, whether we will find out also the second mush with it .<br>S I printed it and then I got really really surprising and interesting results. In that moment my eyes did open widely and joy filled me, joy about such an amazing mush play.<br>The results were: <em>Roland, Raluca and Stephen</em>. Sidenote: Roland and Stephen were confirmed humans or at least no alpha mushes (xyloph).<br>Now I got it... we witnessed here an amazing transfer move where the old body died of starvation. In addition with perfect timing!<br>The new body of the mush could only have been Paola or Frieda and I remembered that i saw paola eating twice recently in lab, I checked it and really, it was after the transfer move. So it was 100% that Frieda is the mush and I innoculated her, much to her displeasure.</p><p>Wow, Raluca, wow Patryk. This mush playing was really good, especially since he was only a silver player, I guess he used only the skill transfer and planned to try getting another mush via fungal kitchen, which could probably have been possible since we considered him as confirmed human (Frieda was confirmed).</p><p>Very well done! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>You would have been successfull if Andie would just have killed me after you told him that we found him already very suspicious. Or if that 50% chance of the list would have worked into your favour. <br>Patryk definitely showed that he is capable of great things.</p><p>I will finish with the story tomorrow. Though the most important part, the mush hunting, is done <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Though we cured Frieda and had no muhs left, we couldn't be fully happy.<br>Chun died in beginning of game of starvation, we lost Jin Su first and a while later Janice because of depression. Janice didn't have much time and was quiet, but when she was online she did at least what people wished her to do, I also recommended her to take the Eufurylate, she took it, but didn't eat it until it was too late and she died unfortunately. These panic attacks are really bothersome. I have the unfounded and fully subjective feeling we got more of them this season ^^.</p><p>So what did we do?<br>Of course the thing, I was most active there I think since I was so nice to always sleep with all the men who had the lowest morale, I changed partners a lot <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><span class="tid_strike">While they suffered I was their heroine and had never to worry about my morale.</span><br>Also we had luckily plenty banana trees and an alien trees with a devil fruit, thanks to Ian! this alien fruit has the bad advantage to give rejuvenation, but it was worth it since we were that low on morale!<br>Ian even took gold for extra hydropots and so we could last several days...barely. These fruits were still never enough.<br>I enjoyed this wild kinky time on ship though and the related conversations ^^</p><p>Frieda was unfortunately not as active and chatty after the curing as previously she seemed to feel a bit shamed of being cured though there is no reason for that. <br>We also tried still hard for Eden, but we had no luck.<br>Not only some people had morale below 5, we also lost 2 people on our final attempt to get 2 starmaps at a planet with crystalite and some artefact zones.<br>Frieda and Terrence were lost I think and so our commander returned us luckily before we had even the possible chance to find any of them dead.</p>

                <p>With a bit more luck with our earlier cristilite zones Eden would have been very attainable. Alas, had to pull the plug. I was fine with losing one crew to the expo if it meant we could take another change at a map piece, but two was unacceptable.</p>

                <p>Let's make it short, I won't tell the story according to chronology (maybe a bit), but mainly the point of Mush's view how the ship looked.</p><br><p><strong>Before breaking the cryo</strong></p><p>As new season appeared and I appreciated each AP gained, I claimed Medlab bed after moving around the ship doing stuff I can't remember but not so important. I went to sleep IRL when got full PA, welp I planned to do more stuff eating food but as soon as came back, became Mush, together with Andie.</p><br><p><strong>"Mush"-hunt</strong></p><p>I was Raluca yeah? Roland had already occupied my room for 2 cycles which could demolize me enough to death if there was Panic Attack because of day change without Chun, but erh, I had a mission to destroy the humanity. After Mush selection (120 glory gain in logs was accurate) Jin Su and Gioele went through the Medlab without reason which could make me worry. I found the Knife and hid it in Nexus before Gioele put the camera there and hid Grenade as well. My main reason was to decrease human's mentality that they could kill the Mush alone with the Knife. Since then they had to contact with trustworthy people to finish with someone and I was one of them (as I tried). Janice made some conforts for me in RAT, I tried to look paranoid that 3 people have visited me. Then Eleesha asked me for the Knife and I asked her to check Jin Su and Gioele. I tried to push on Gioele who was dirty and visited me in the Medlab. Told Eleesha, that if she tells me that Gioele visited me after Mush selection (which I thoroughly knew he had done), I'd kill him immediately because I had no reason to take this risk that I could be infected. And Eleesha told that he was staying in the Lab with other people and couldn't make any spore when directly entered Medlab, which didn't allow me to stab him. Eh, it failed. I had to give them the Knife when they were going to kill Derek because he was inactive and dangerous.</p><p>Eleesha was a good player, but trusted me very much and I had to trust her as well. She got to channel other people she trusted, such as Frieda and Terrence as well as Stephen who got an illness. She didn't invite Ian although I adviced as he boosted research. She didn't trust him enough. In first few days, more and more people were becoming confirmed... Kuan Ti with illness (or disorter), Terrence with disorter, Paola double-eating, Frieda and Roland as negative in Xyloph list... it went fast, the last people unconfirmed Mush-hunting were me and Eleesha, but Eleesha also got an illness soon. I was the only one who had access to Mush hunt without being confirmed.</p><br><p><strong>Crew's overview</strong></p><p>I checked all the crew beside Derek because he died too early. Excluding Chun and my fellow Mush, there were 2 spored people of 13: Terrence and Frieda. I was so surprised because I expected this season as easy for Mush because of spores spread around the human crew, however just 2 people were spored, just 2... It wasn't half of crew as I expected... it wasn't even quarter. So I had to focus on them both. As soon as Eleesha noticed the Knife is missing, I treated her as obdurate opponent, I couldn't play at with her onboard at ease.</p>

                <p>Since the beginning, as I worked out the crew a bit, I had just one plan: to look confirmed human. I was trustworthy, but it wasn't much, it was like nothing, I needed to be confirmed, this is what human cannot imagine or understand: I wanted to look confirmed, but I am Mush.</p><br><p><strong>Project: Sacrifice the partner</strong></p><p>Andie logged back as Mush after 8 cycles. She was active just once per 8 cycles, when some research was done without any biologists. She acted muted in public chat as I didn't believe she would survive long days. I didn't see how she could keep her cover, so as soon as I saw her first signs of playing, I came up with suicide mission. As Stephen had become confirmed and I was interested in him, I told Andie to remove the camera in the Dorm he was in, spike him and steal Stainproof Apron and Medikit hijacking Patrol Ship. It would really help Mush team much more than being alive and waiting for getting stabbed earlier or sooner. But she refused and it made me sad.</p><br><p><strong>Andie the partner</strong></p><p>I had a partner who was active once or twice per day, but did nothing useful as Mush... even pretending to be human wasn't her trump. She picked Polyvalent and Devoted which was the worst skill she could do. She wasn't doing research attracting more and more suspicion, and I tried to make her aware that Stephen could copy her skill if she slows that all. Moreover, she blocked the way to hijack a Patrol Ship if something went wrong as she was silver and couldn't pick Pilot. Transferring would be a terrible idea if she kept her body alive... the Polyvalent. She did nothing to look human nor to help something for Mush. I asked her once if they are spored people in her room, she told nobody was there and told that there were Eleesha, Gioele and Terrence, but Terrence was spore and it wasted me some PM to make sure if Terrence was really spored, thanks to Andie. As she was the only person onboard with research boost, I allowed myself to talk in Mush Channel instead of using private conversations and she once told my name I got so scared as I kept the rest of day repeating her that she shouldn't have told my name because of Stephen who could make Pheromodem in case Andie got killed.</p><p>Once the Mush hunt team prepared to kill Andie, I warned her but she didn't react as she should have. She believed that she could hold it more, no rampage even when I told her everything about weapon she could take. She took part of expedition, hunters had already discussed that they'd kill Andie as soon as she comes back. I told her that she had no time and she had to rampage as soon as expedition finishes, but she wasn't active then, she died, Stephen became Polyvalent. Thanks to Andie they could make the RFS, but what had she done for Mush team? Trouble. And I didn't care all the time I was Mush because I used to play with partners like her forcing me to play solo, to reach my aim I didn't need partner anymore and thanks that new season appeared it was more helpful than partner.</p><br><p><strong>Project: Leave expedition team</strong></p><p>Andie was informed that she would die soon. Instead of rampage, she came up with the idea of leaving expedition team with her there. I don't know if she wanted to call it sacrifice, but it wasn't. It was just an extermination of Mush Superiority. The plan was to reveal myself as Mush as I leave expedition team. Andie would be left there. She told that she couldn't miss expedition because crew forced her to take part. But she was about to kill, so what's the difference? She could help me to keep my cover and reach my aim, but she planned to get rid of us both, as some technicians would survive to rush PILGRED and return to Sol. It'd just annoy human team, nobody sane would do this. I needed Beta, but she didn't bring them.</p>

                <p>Thanks for sharing the story of your point of view, Patryk. I enjoyed reading it! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Maybe you find out more ways in future how to get your mush partner cooperating with you better, some social skills may even help with bad mush partners, at least sometimes.<br>If Andie didn't want to help you as you suggested, you may have discussed what she had in mind, explaining patiently why it is maybe worse and think together for another way or she could have explained at least why she didn't want to do as you suggested.<br>Trying to feed the fire of the partner's enthusiasm may help and make your situation more comfortable for you, so you don't have to struggle alone against all these evil humans who do their best to get and mostly kill you.<br>Maybe you tried it already hard, but Andie had deaf ears and my suggestion is not really needed. I hope you don't mind then.</p>

                <p>So why didn I make spores? Reason was simply, cameras spread around, no way to direct spores, no way to deface logs Eleesha wouldn detect, and focusing Eleesha wouldn melt the eye of crew, no worth AP to trap food or places which would make some people in spores but get myself killed. So I used my Mush skills to look more human. Phagocyte? Nope... there was another way.</p><br><p><strong>Project: On the way to Terrence</strong></p><p>Terrence was one of confirmed human because of cured disorter as I remember. So I got a plan to transfer into gold Terrence as silver player. Possible? Obviously possible! His skills were Robotics Expert, Technician and Pilot. Paola found Mage Book of Pilot from Xyloph. I could get access to everywhere as Terrence. My plan was to make a Post-Its in the Icarus Bay and drop it in Alpha Dorm where Terrence was. Then get the Mage Book of Pilot and hold it in inventory telling crewmates that I would hold in safe place. Then get my body starved and low HP to 1. I could also make another note which Terrence could read after his death in Raluca's body which I would shred to not drop it after her death. Transfering into Terrence picking 2 first skills would make Raluca die due to starvation and then wake up pretending to read the Post-Its when in the truth I read the Mage Book which Raluca drops. Nobody would see the log of Mage Book, just the log that I read something. The disadvantage was that I noticed how Paola was determined to hold this Mage Book in her inventory. Sad she wasn't my Mush partner, it would be done. Moreover, Terrence's RP was hard and exhaustive, I wondered if I could mimic him.</p><br><p><strong>On the way to Frieda</strong></p><p>Frieda looked for me as easy target, much easier than Terrence, to get and to act, but her mobility was so low as if there appeared the second Mush hunt channel, she wouldn't be invited I had believed. Her participation into Mush hunt was zero. She was so quiet telling just progress of research, planets scans and comments what happened in her room or herself.</p><p>As soon as 3 days of my wretched life appeared, I took the Ration but didn't eat this because it was needed to look human. Not that I could make myself dirty, but I didn't want my body fed, it would be bad for me because I was going to transfer into confirmed human and not let my old body live. Frieda became trustworthy person as soon as she bumped much research when we were on planet, meaning that she didn't make any spores but played against Mush. I didn't want to transfer into her yet because I was as trustworthy as Frieda, she wasn't confirmed. When Paola printed Xyloph List, Frieda was found as Negative which proved her humanity and it was the time my dreams were fulfilled, it was the step towards the breakthrough, she was the key.</p><p>It was around day 6. Andie had attracted too much suspicion. I didn't share plans with her in Mush channel because she wasn't required for the plan and she might mess up in case Pheromodem would come. It was cycle 4... I came to the Bridge and started to hurt myself from 14 HP to 1 HP. I took the Medikit with myself. I was holding Ration to look like I didn't eat it but held in inventory to look like human who starves because doesn't eat the ration, nobody had been able to check me starving as I had been alone in all cycle changes. But then I was on the Bridge as Raluca. It might've attracted suspicions, but nobody would kill me right then. I picked up and dropped repeatly iTrakie. To lose 2 HP it took me 15 minutes, and each pair... While doing this the game was draining the fun of playing, it was becoming more and more stressful, I hated doing this but as I didn't have another way, I kept doing this. I was scared because I had active private channel with actual Mush hunters onboard and "Online" status showed there, I was scared that people might notice this and work out that I'm chatting with Mush partner. Fortunately nobody showed any sign of activity then, especially Eleesha, who I was afraid. Cycle 4 I dropped my HP to 8 and waited for cycle change in case of room shakes and steel plates. And I healed myself once to 11 HP. Another 15-20 minutes took me to drop it to 9 HP. Then the game drained all the fun from me, I was picking up my iTrakie to hurt myself and kept doing this a whole hour, but nothing was happening. I had picked up around 600 times but HP level was still 9. I gave up, regretted I wasted AP on healing myself.<br>My plan was trying to get to wash myself. I found the first best excuse to get dirty: repairing fuel tank. I was carefully managing my AP/MP stockage. I haven't wasted any AP to repair the fuel tank, anyway I did this. I had 9 HP. I found the way that I could wash myself twice cycle 7, be on the Bridge and transfer out. The problem was that research team made Spore Sucker in the meantime. I was just scared of Frieda, she was active cycle 7 and it happened. I needed to keep her spored to cycle change. I took a risk. I went yolo to shower myself twice. It was supposed to drop between 1 and 3. If 1, then transfer on cycle change easy. If 3, then hurt myself once and transfer. But I got 2, the worst result I could take. I couldn't go to the Bridge then. I could wait the whole cycle change to gain HP. I went to the Lab to make sure if Frieda was there. I wasn't sure but I went to FAT and stayed there hoping nothing would happen to me in the next 2 cycle changes.</p><p>There were many things that could happen to ruin my plan. The least possible: MycoAlarm on the Bridge, somebody random going to FAT and hitting me to death. Even possible that it could be Gioele or Chun who just woke up from inactivity, went through FAT but hit Gioele a couple of times who guarded FC while people were on expedition. It was the time when human team betrayed Andie and when she came back from expedition so wounded, they finished her off. To ruin my plan the most dangerous was random stuff, steel plate or room shake, just single shot could make me dead and crew would laugh at this looking at me as a jester.</p><p>I found myself cycle 1 alive with 3 HP. I went to the Bridge to check if Frieda is spore - she was. I prepared myself, hurting after 7 minutes and leaving myself at 1 HP. I hoped nothing would surprise me, for example Frieda being active to extract spore from herself or just being active on cycle change to eat the ration I held. Every sign of activity from Frieda could ruin my plan. Eh, but the cycle change was coming. 10 minutes before cycle change, I woke up IRL at night in stress (I couldn't sleep anyway) and picked "Transfer" skill, looking at the timer above. 5 minutes left... I refreshed page once more... 4 minutes left... Refresh and transfer into Frieda! Go go, Astrophysicist and IT Expert. Uh... Raluca still lives, the human still lives, aware of danger, but able to shout? Oh I got so much stress as I went out for a while...</p><p>... and back I look new cycle change, death announcement: Raluca died due to starvation. There appeared some comments. Terrence's was first. He remembered my excuse that I had problem with laptop and wished Mrs. Tomescu better luck in future ships. Human crew commented that I was so good for crew and then this accident. Oh well, for my Mushy things to look human they are looking up to after "my" death. Just Stephen was so ruthless telling there was no excuse for this deed. But me in Frieda? I felt so relieved. While transferring and picking skills the activity shown in private conversation hasn't changed. I felt so relieved, all the trouble disappeared.</p>

                <p>Argh I don't have much time to make a story, I will talk like it was blablabla.</p><p>Later I was trying to mimic Frieda and talk like her. I abused being confirmed and made 2 spores with excuse of getting dirty because of using Spore Sucker getting hurt while showering. Carrying 2 spores on the Bridge invited Chun into Mush hunt and noticed that it didn't affect on my activity so I invited Hua because she wasn't clear and to make chaos in Mush hunt and force people to kill each other to get rid of suspects then more trustworthy crewmembers. I didn't invite Ian because he could make some food-test and get away. RFS was being made so I rushed so if they inject some human, I could infect food with spores so nobody would betray me in case they turn human or if killed, don't make the suspicion of Beta active. Anyway I waited meanwhile even not noticing that there's another Mush hunt. Well, Frieda was zero activity in Mush hunting, so I was quiet. Then they put some false LIST and injected me when Eleesha worked out that Raluca should've been the Mush and that's how I got ashamed waking out as human.</p><p>I picked Pilot and Survivalist skills because there were so many Astrophysicists, one with coffee boost. I was so quiet because nothing interesting to say, I was killing hunters and if not, collecting scrap. We had many scrap, there was a planet, I shot some hunters outside and took some stuff waiting for the launch because I didn't have AP to do so. If no hunter/scrap outside, I was relaying some projects then. Waiting hours, cycles... then noted that 30 minutes before Stephen joined the Icarus Bay and in the same minute he yelled at me, told I was useless lazy old bag that I did nothing all the time then took the Compass and went offline for another as he supposed days, and bullied that he'd kill me if there hadn't been morale problem because he joined Icarus Bay without Compass. Spamming my private inbox in my profile I dropped the Compass, then we took part on expedition. Paola forgot Spacesuit, Stephen was with Compass, me and Terrence got lost on the planet so we returned to Sol. End.</p>

                <p>I didn't spam shit, patryk, and you know it. I sent you one message in PM asking NICELY if you'd please log back in and drop the compass.

You had JUST logged off so I figured I could hopefully catch you. We were in a time crunch and couldn't wait for you to log back in a few cycles later.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1835388/20150917171625488.png">Here's the actual screenshot.</a></p><p>Yes, I got snarky. I was completely blown away that someone that knows the game as well as you do would take the compass knowing that we needed a diplomat and that if I were to go MIA on that planet, the rest of you would be as good as dead. But nowhere in there is an actual threat. Did I contemplate it? Sure. I never actually threatened it.</p>

                <p>Well, the whole conversation can be read better in the <a target="_blank" href="http://adremides.com.ar/Prueba/navei.html">link of Logos</a>.<br>And actually I thought we solved that little conflict already there.<br>It happened when our situation was already rather desperate and therefore some active and caring people felt a bit stressed.<br>Therefore I guess it may be troublesome starting an argument now, in the hind sight, whether people acted/said right or wrong. <br>From a rather neutral point I think Stephen and Terrence overreacted a bit. <br>At same time Paola didn't even equip a spacesuit (and had the drill) and noone made such a fuss about her.<br>While Frieda was actually active to drop the compass, I guess she would have dropped it even quicker if people wouldn't have blamed here already the same minute they found out that she has equipped the compass.<br>Also I noticed Frieda using up all her aps for piloting. That she didn't use the bed after last piloting may have been not that efficient, but well.<br>But behind all of it this is probably not an argument about facts, it is about emotions.<br>And looking at it from an emotional point of view the picture is more different.<br>After Frieda was cured, she wasn't very talkative and said not more stuff than "hunters down." or "scrap collected", she was much more talkative in beginning of game and when she was mush. It may seem ill-mannered for the active people, who talked and thought much more about what to do facing the ship's dangers, like Stephen and Terrence.<br>What I know is, that Patryk felt ashamed after being cured. I can't understand it that much, since he just had bad luck and I don't see why being cured is worse than being killed. It should be opposite I guess, because we consider the person is <strong>that worthful </strong>, that we want to cure it!</p><p>So Patryk's increased silenceness (and therefore less caring) made not a nice impression and lead to some anger though technically (looking at ap usage and such stuff ) there is not that much to complain.</p><p>What may lay hidden even more deeper behind of this (without knowing for sure of course) is that people knew at that time that Frieda was Patryk (since he posted in Fail thread while ship was ongoing) and with spacekadt and Patyk I had already a ship, where Patryk (like we know him) said only his worst reasons why he killed the mush, while he probably had other reasons, anyway, it lead to some anger, which is probably not fully forgotten.</p><p>What I am writing here, is to some extend only interpretation and some assumptions, it shouldn't be taken too seriously, but also not too lightly. Because what I am wishing for is an <strong>extended</strong> point of view regarding Patryk. <br>His mush play did amaze us! And we should remember this feeling when dealing with him.<br>He is NOT just a troll, who is bringing people on the edge of their patience.<br>In the forum he evolved more and more to a person, who must feel rather alone, facing so many bad reactions. He didn't stop his special messages, which may be interpreted as trolling (what is probably not even always the case-people were biased sometimes) and provoked often other people. Maybe because he doesn't care very much about it or because he feels just rebellious seeing so few people understanding him.<br>How he feels about some things (like being cured) may be different from our understanding, but it doesn't change his amazing performance and his big potential.<br>If he had better social skills helping to deal and work together with many kind of mush partners I guess he would be the perfect mush. Even in his curent state he is very dangerous.<br>Of course, saying that is increasing the danger that Patryk feels megalomaniacally, which may result that he feels better than many of us (looking how he is behaving sometimes he seems to have that impression already occasionally <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) . I hope that's not the case, because according to the wise people: when he is thinking like that, it will be more and more untrue.</p><p>I just want him to know, that I respect him as good player. Which doesn't mean that I agree with all of his opinions and way of thinking, but that's not the case with every person, right?<br>And I even wrote such a big wall of text for him <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>In the hope it prevents a dispute, which would have followed otherwise I think and maybe to let people think about looking at Patryk not only from the usual perspective, but some new - an extended perspective.</p>

                <p>I think you're really overthinking it a bit. I, personally, didn't have too much of a problem with Patryk. I was a bit frustrated with a good chunk of the crew who refused to put out fires, heal people, blocked up morale locations, etc. Patryk broke off communication in large (as you mentioned) after he was cured which hurt teamwork a bit. It was a little frustrating but there were definitely worse people there.</p><p>Really I think one of the things that highlighted Patryk was some of the compliments you gave him randomly about piloting. That's pretty much all he ever did after getting cured. He refused to spread his skills around (astro + pilot) and took skills that would let him focus on a single aspect of the game. This left many of the crew spread thin as he was only good (skill-wise) for piloting and expos (barely). In the off time for hunters he didn't help with healing or morale, I think he might have hit a fire once or twice but that was about it. So yeah, it was a bit disheartening to see him get good jobs when Stephen, myself, you, and Ian were moving constantly to keep the crew alive (I was literally moving every single cycle since I was the most active person, left no time for piloting). Kuan Ti was the only dedicated scanner but even he had to deviate to heal at times which made progress all that much slower.</p><p>As for the expo, it was the end of the ship. We had been talking about finishing the ship for a good day with some people wanting to continue and the others understanding that it just wasn't possible. I take caring for the crew very seriously, I don't like casualties and it adds stress when others aren't as aware so that conversation helped boost some of the crankyness for me, personally. Then we finally manage to get ourselves to the planet, myself and the diplo were ready so we went down and noticed Patryk had taken the compass which made NO sense given the zones on that planet (pretty much assured death). On a ship where so much was slowing progress, the last thing we wanted to see was something slowing progress again. So yes we got a bit cranky. We didn't say much about Paola because it would've been a waste of time to type to her. She wouldn't have picked up a spacesuit. Patryk, on the other hand, would have dropped the compass.</p><p>Patryk is an amazing mush but I feel that's all he ever cares about in the game. He pretty much shut down after we cured him, becoming your average robotic random who only does the job and nothing more. This was extremely disappointing given how intelligent of a player he was prior. It's unfair treatment the way he got spotlighted like that but the other crew does bad and continues to do bad and you learn to accept it, a good player turns bad though then that's stuff you notice.</p><p>It may have been a lucky list that caused him to get caught (of course 50/50 are pretty ok odds so it wasn't THAT lucky), but the hunters put in a LOT of effort to catch him. Our reward for it was underwhelming and later frustrating. There was a lot of talk that he would've gotten away with it if not for the list and he would have for a little while but I sincerely doubt he would have beaten us. The fact that he was caught and didn't really want to do much on the ship, besides his skill-required activities, made me feel as though we didn't bring him to OUR team.</p><p>I think that pretty much sums up my feelings about things. Last-minute crank, disappointing post-mush play, undeserved compliments, hard work going unrecognized because of a stroke of luck. All that jazz...</p>

                <p>Yeah, well... I admit, I complimate people too less and so it might have seem strange that i gave patryk a compliment though more hard working people might not get one from me on the ship. <br>But this was because I feared Patryk would be even less helpful after being cured. It seemed to me that he was really unhappy about being cured and failing, so I just thought he is the person who needs cheering up most.<br>Didn't help much I guess ^^</p>

                <p>I understand Sperbi, that's a tactic I use often, myself. Generally though I keep it very broad in public and, when I'm complimenting specific people I generally do it by PM as not to play favorites. Calling someone "the best pilot" may make the other pilots feel less adequate, especially when general duties keep them from being able to pilot (like myself and Stephen). It wasn't the main cause of the issues but it didn't help morale.</p><p>On a more positive note. LogoS, I was also supporting you joining TE and was talking about you in our IRC.

I like this server because most of the time the ships I played has tons of new chats to read when I return to game, lot of things happen even in the middle of the cycle.
