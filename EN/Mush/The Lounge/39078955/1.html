Better luck next time.</p><p><a href="http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/journal/v/323" target="_blank">http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/journal/v/323</a></p><br><p>My thoughts -</p><p>Andie Graham - Very active, managed to keep up with research while also helping out with the mush hunt. Nice playing with you but PLEASE use first names, the surnames confued the crap out of me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Kim Jin Su - Inactive</p><p>Derek Hogan - Decently active, did a good job tracking down terrence. Well done.</p><p>Lai Kuan Ti - Inactive</p><p>Eleesha Williams - Did nothing of use and stood around for most of it</p><p>Paola Rinaldo - Did not communicate and traded without permission, please ask next time, communication is key in this game.</p><p>Raluca Tomescu - Same as Eleesha but did do some things of use i guess in working on pilgred.</p><p>Frieda Bergmann - Found us one awsome planet then went inactive. Why you leave <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Roland Zuccali - Inactive</p><p>Gioele Rinaldo (originally Stephen, A Mush) - You kinda outed yourself when you said that solid would not work as currently is bugged. Terrence's mistake actually helped you as we where going to take you out in a cycle or two anyway.</p><p>Stephen Seagull (originally Gioele) - Was fairly useful but we required a bit more activity from you. If you plan to play Gioele or Stephen you kinda have to be ready for chapitanship.</p><p>Ian Soulton - Err me i guess, i did some guardening and uppercut a mush to death and thats it.</p><p>Terrence Archer (A Mush) - Did fairly well in delaying us, just was a little too obveous about it. Also the extraction mistake was a bit bad, but we all make mistakes</p><p>Janice Kent - Did a good job in keeping everyone healthy, and helped with projects. Good job.</p><p>Jiang Hua - Welcome to the game, hope you enjoyed and will stick around as your not a bad player.</p><p>Zhong Chun - Good job with helping the mush hunt, and moving our ship when nessesary. Just we needed a capitan and you could have done great things.</p><p>Good job crew, pity for all the inactivity though.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I just wanted to say: <span class="tid_sideNote">What another Andie using last names to address the crew?</span><br>Then, oh right that was me. So it's over already. Yep that was a rather unlucky trip. A ship that didn't fill up until Day 2 Cycle 2 (probably because we were all sitting around waiting for MMM-day) is usually full with inactive, newbies and failures.</p><p>We had lots of cyro-damaged folks. A really good newbie. And tons of failure. Mainly my own. &lt;.&lt;</p><p>I <em>did</em> notice the oddness of Stephens failed attempt to move Eleesha out. I <em>remember</em> checking the forum for whenever the bug was still not fixed. No idea what kept me busy then, but I just went and forgot it. Or put it really far back in mind.</p><p>We <em>should have</em> killed him right away. But there was no we. At least non I was part of then and like I said my thoughts were kinda off. When Derek reported the Nexus incident I quickly assembled everyone active and talking at the moment (plus Ian) to discuss the matter outside of GC. Again my mind was oddly off and I invited Chun really late because I just didn't think of it. Okay that's not that much of a failure...</p><p>But then.... we went on that expedition. I loaded fuel afterwards. Got stuck in IB. Nice and all. But once I was able to move again. I just rushed to my bed. <br>[I have this bed-fixation from mainly playing Raluca before the update. I glue myself to a bed now that I can claim one....] And I just went past RC <em>not noticing</em> that damn glowing red log of <em>Terrence extracting a spore</em>. Second big failure.</p><p>Another smaller failure: I went down to the Dorms, not wanting to drain Raluca off her moral. Noticed the Log (finally) and alarmed all my private channels. I even opened a new one to ask the just re-awakening Gioele to do some mush killing with all the energy he gained by idling. I should have stayed in Medlab kicked Raluca off and survived the massacre that followed but the failure was something else. Who do you think I kicked of down there in AD to get a bed? Terrence who I had just proven to be mush? Nai. Kuan Ti the idler. Why? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I don't think I did this much mistakes in my first ship. &lt;.&lt; Okay. My memory only works for a few weeks anyway but still. That was so ARRGH!</p><p>This:<br>«Sorry Andie! I've been killed during my long sleep. I hope you'll be fine without your Great Derek. ♥» made my <span class="tid_strike">day</span> well it's night now, so night though. I died before you. ;D</p>

                <p>yea we kinda should have killed Stephen earlier, I would have but pacifism sucks for helping out the mush team.
