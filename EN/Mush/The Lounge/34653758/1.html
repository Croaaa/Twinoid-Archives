                <p>So, this ship! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> This filthy, filthy ship. <br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1760" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1760</a></p><p>Was Gioele. We actually found Terrence mush pretty early - he was active but his AP wasn't going to hunters or anything that we could tell, and he took shower damage. Instead of killing him though, I fixed a broken O2 tank, seemed like the wiser choice, and boy was I wrong! Terrence mush dismantled both showers day 2, and hid some really vital items. Finola, Chun, Frieda and Eleesha (then comms manager) ALL got dirty killing him. All in all, he did quite a bit of damage. Once both showers were dismantled, only one person could shower per day. So of course, Finola got the first shower, so she didn't lose morale. At that point, myself, Chao, Eleesha, Chun and Frieda were dirty. Everyone else was clean. Notices were posted everywhere about the importance of people staying clean, the how and the why - don't fix non vital things, don't eat without the apron, etc.</p><p>So, what happens? Of course, nearly everyone clean manages to get dirty, lol.</p><p>We decided Eleesha should shower day 3 to get comms up and running, since Paola had been inactive. Paola came active right before the day change though, and yay, she was clean! So Day 3, we wanted Frieda to shower to get back to planet scanning.... But she said she wasn't active enough, so Chun showered instead. In the meantime, Hua went and tried to fix a broken turret we'd asked people to drop a drone on and leave alone, and got dirty. About an hour later, Kuan Ti went and fixed that same turret, also getting dirty, despite many of us explaining once again why that was bad. A few hours later, Jin Su gets dirty kicking an inactive out of a bed. Not 10 minutes later, Janice gets dirty kicking an <strong>active</strong> out of a bed. And then, before Paola gets any progress made on comms, she gets dirty pulling a coffee from the machine. Well, we've found who our day 4 shower will be.</p><p>Meanwhile, all these people getting dirty for odd reasons were seriously muddying up our mush hunt. Jin Su was under suspicion because he'd idled in alpha bay with the soap for 24 hours. Kuan Ti because he was dirty doing something he definitely shouldn't have done and his only skill was optimist. Chao because he'd been idling all over the place dirty from working on the wrong research. And those were just the most obvious of the options. There were more people on this ship who I could reasonably see being mush than not. Thankfully, Chao spiked an inactive in a corridor with a mycoalarm, and Eleesha caught it. Eleesha checked, couldn't print the tabulatrix list, so no beta mush - Chao hadn't managed to convert anyone despite quite a bit of time wandering the ship, and we were mush free.</p><p>Day 5, Frieda showered. She found an O2 planet and we limped along. Our NERON projects were seriously behind due to a lack of people who could work on them, but Raluca kept plugging away and we got the plasma shield.</p><p>Chun really rocked this ship. She relayed with Finola and they pumped out a ton of research. And then, she relayed with Raluca and they finished the plasma shield. And she was a sweetie to boot. Gioele was so impressed that he adopted her. Just kind of announced it as a fact and assumed she'd be okay with it. Thankfully, she was. ^^;</p><p>All in all, this was a fun ship. Returned to Sol day 6. Could have kept going longer, but we had the serum and the ship was crippled with the shower situation. So we put it to a vote, had a very clear majority, and went back to Sol.</p>

                <p>Very well summarized <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I was Chun this trip, and I found the Mush hunting very nerve-wracking, but in the end we had no human casualties, thanks to Eleesha's sharp eyes finding our second mush.</p><p>Everyone was very kind to Chun this trip-Gioele offered to adopt, Roland seemed twitter-patted, Eleesha vowed to help if bad people came for Chun, and many others said super sweet things. Everyone was great - the Hua and Roland did well shooting and gathering scrap, Raluca really rocked out her research as well as Finola, Janice kept us in good spirits (and Eleesha late game), Frieda found a great planet (and would have found more now that she was clean <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico">). Paola came on reliably around day change (post new years) and pumped out a bunch of comms stuff. Even our optimist Kuan contributed sporadically to our survival <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. If it wasn't for our super-effective kamikaze mush Terrence, we probably would have been able to go the distance. Still, it was a great ship, and I look forward to playing together with all of you again.</p>
