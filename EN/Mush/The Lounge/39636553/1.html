                <p>Hi, Eleesha here <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"> ,<br>After a nice journey with an interesting game against the mushes we finally arrived at Sol at cycle 8 of day 10. I am glad that I did my job this time very well. And here is the end:<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4610" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4610</a></p><p>We had much nice human players who were helping very much, especially: <br>Terrence, Andie, Raluca, Derek, Kuan Ti, Frieda and Roland, who was actually a new player but acted very smart. I was really impressed.</p><p>And I was impressed by Janice, our fully sneaky mush. Oh, the mush hunt was really difficult here, since we had some suspicious people (Hua-who didn't communicate and help at all), Ian (who did strange things), Jin (who didn't communicate and didn't move the ship even once) and Stephen (who did nothing than standing around the whole game).<br>And Janice was the master of sneakiness. she was always helpful, she even scanned for planets, always posted the right direction, motivated us to do expeditions, always tried her best to keep the morale of the crew very high, instantly activated plasma shield when Raluca genuised it and so on.... So I even invited her in my channel of the mush hunt and she was informed about all of our suspicions then. <br>I think she would have been successfull as mush if I haven't had luck with the list. I waited very long with printing since I wanted to try getting the mushes without it. But when we had only stephen left of our 4 suspicious people - we killed Hua and Ian, we realized that Jin was starving at one point. I decided to print it at day 7 (first person arrived at day 1,cycle 8 on the ship...).<br>And there was the BIG surprise:</p><p>On the list we had the names<em> Janice, Roland and Chun</em>. Chun was of course no mush and she was already dead because she starved-actually she did nothing in the whole game. Roland was dead as well, unfortunately Gioele moved the ship when Roland was outside with the pasisphae.</p><p>Since I saw how helpful Janice was I had the plan to cure her and so I invited almost all people of the ship into a second channel except Stephen (we thought he is one of the mushes), useless Jin and Paola (that was just an instinct of myself-i had doubts about paola since she was very slow with doing her job and decoding rebel bases. Additionally she was inactive since a day). We all agreed to cure Janice and first we wanted to kill Stephen, then finish xyloph and do the cure. After killing stephen we were surprised that he was human and now i had a little panic-what if someone of the new channel is one of the mushes.. the whole plan to cure Janice would fall apart... <br>So we decided to kill Paola, who wasn't in the channel and my biggest mush suspect. Derek should do it and say that she was on the list, so janice could feel relaxed and we could finish the serum quietly.. at leat that was the plan.<br>Killing Paola went according to that plan, she really was mush and we also said we killed her because of the list. Then I saved aps to decode Xyloph bases, but an incident happened which changed my plans: Derek wanted that someone would heal his gastroenteritis and Janice said she would help if he would bring the new upgraded meditkit to the dorm. He did it and was then alone in the dorm with Janice which worried me. So I went to the dorm with the hope to prevent any mushy action of Janice if she was planning to do something like that. Unfortunately I couldn't prevent her following move. <br>I was online again 15 minutes after daychange and saw a new mush in the mush bar, there was no suspicious log in the room (only that Janice waked up, not more), but I realized that a camera was missing (I was very sure the camera was still there when I entered the room since I feared that Janice already did something to Derek). So I got me a ration, the hidden knife and fortunately Gioele was online too, so we killed Derek together. I got a torn tongue during that process (which I wasn't able to heal until the end of the voyage-one time I tried it, failed and got a sepsis using the surgery pod of medlab-the medic skill is really missing.). <br>Janice must have realized that she was found out, she grabbed the meditkit and left the dorm. I feared she would take off with it, but after a while we heared an angry Raluca ranting about Janice, who attacked her and who was then instantly killed by that Raluca with the use of only her fists. (ah, looking at the end screen she was promoted to "Heavyweight Mush Boxing ChampionÂ» <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">)<br>And that was the downfall of Janice, the queen of sneakiness. Thanks for being that skilled <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It was a nice game, thank you very much all people involved here, we did fight very hard in the end and achieved our goal-ticket and return to sol with serum <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>(and the last days I was always communicating using general announcements becaue of my torn tongue xD)</p>

She must have thought she was going to kill or depress me to death. So many Ralucas never have the AP to resist, but being level 5, ihad all the free point skills. She came down and started swinging on me only to find I had a full 12 AP to beat her down with. Fun times, fun ship.</p><p>I was all for curing her, but she was down there swinging on me and the serum wasn't done, so I had to go Fist of the North Star on her.</p>

                <p>Oh! There's an AP thread. I just thought to check if the ship had ended.</p><p>Your dearly departed Janice here.</p><p>You have no idea how thrilled I am that you had to print the list to find me. I kept wondering where I messed up... I always knew the list was a problem and it very clever to lure me into thinking you'd wasted Paola on it.</p><p>In this case, I thought I had some help early on, but Paola failed to use her skill of slime trap, stopped talking and then went inactive. Arg. With just a bit of help, a clever trap? One of us being able to take anonymush? Ooooh, this would have been an even more delightful game of cat and mouse.</p><p>Since that was not to be, I was forced to improvise late game. Not nearly as elegantly as I'd hoped, and I considered dropping the covert Derek conversion plan when Eleesha 'happened' to show up in the dorm with Derek and I at the day change I had planned. But eh... I figured as good as time as any to give defacer a test run. I was super annoyed that it got me out of bed. Oops. Won't make that mistake again.</p><p>Since you killed Derek so quick, it was obvious you were on to me already and I never go down without a fight. So onward I went with phase 2 of the current plan: kill Raluca. Unfortunately, trying to covertly convert Derek wasted enough ap I didn't stand much of a chance. Especially not when Raluca promptly started beating me. Eh, it was worth a chance and I made you kill me and Derek, so... there's that.</p>
