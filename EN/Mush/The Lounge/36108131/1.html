Janice, Terrence, Gioele, Paola and Ian went inactive pretty fast, Jin Su just came online twice to hold his Commander title and to move from one corridor to another standing there uselessly. Half of the others just logged in once or twice the day to do their respective jobs and thus were unavailable in case of emergency.</p><p>But still we were doing good, given the situation. Until day four there were almost no hunters around so research, Pilgred and projects were slowly but steadily progressing and only real worry was our bad luck with O2 planet. One mush was standing inactive in the Front Bravo Turret and second, Hua, keeping low profile.</p><p>In the middle of fourth day suddenly 18 hunters appeared. With our pilots and Kuan Ti holding Hacker kit in his inventory currently AFK, our hull quickly get from 85 to like 30. Even Eleesha disabling the pilot lock and Chao trying to shoot some of the hunters didn't help much. Roland came online to late and got hunters down just to 12.</p><p>In the meantime, we still struggled at finding planet with O2, so when there was need to fill the Combustion chamber and hack the Commander terminal to move us, no-one had APs to do that.</p><p>Hua's attack on the Bridge at the start of fifth day was just insurance, I guess. Daedalus was destroyed just cycle after it and I believe it would be so even if she didn't kill me and Terrence and didn't break the Hacker kit.</p><p>Special thanks to people like Chao, Kuan Ti, Eleesha, Raluca and even Frieda who were really active and tried to keep us going even in the face of huge inactivity and bad luck. I didn't enjoy it so much as my other ships but I guess it's mostly because as Chun I couldn't do much with our situation so I felt most of the time pretty useless. Well, maybe we will meet on better ship in the future! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
