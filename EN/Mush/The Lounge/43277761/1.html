                <p>Comrades! I! Commisair Paobao of The Pink Revolution! Hehe <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> It was fun ship. Good one. Andie did splendid job as Mush! Or at least She did tried Her best! Hua also did what She could! So I don't count that rampage against Her (D6 so it is obvious that She was simply cornered and didn't had any more options left as to rampage). Crew was also really good! I took special pleasure in working with TuttiKuanTi. Why? Because we had very simmilar ideas about how to do things. There were very little things we didn't agreed on really. For example He believed that it would be better for me to be Comm Expert and Logistic, while I think better choice is Logistic and Shooter (that allows me technicly to get rid of that one nasty arack without wasting AP, and help on expos with no Polyvalent/Diplomat). But those are details - most of time we had simmilar ideas and did supported each other in what has to be done. Also I have feeling that when He was starting to get harsh on others I was comming in to clear atmosphere a bit. Maybe that is not true, but I have feeling that it was like that.</p><p>Anyways... Let's start from begining, shall we? Why did I choose Paola as starting character? Simple - because I wanted spend one ship in solitary, ejnoing nice story unfolds before me. And I actually got what I wanted untill I managed to get "Non Alpha List" from Xylophs. There was my name as non-alpha, and I sayed all time since Mushes were choosen under cameras (litelary), so I was comfirmed humman. So I got invited into Mush Hunt Chat. But honestly - what I can know about others when I was sitting all the time on bridge? Nothing really so I didn't brought any value into hunting. It was all Elemele's job.</p><p>I will skip most of ship and will start from where Hua started Her rampage. We were unlucky in that She decided to kill Elemele first - and Elemele was holding knife (She got it from me just few minutes before to kill Terrence - inactive). So Elemele got killed. Than with knife Janice was killed and than Frieda. We lost our Shrink and Pilot (YES! TuttiKuanTi was our Astro, while Frieda was Piloting!). I had no idea who was killing so I got down to dorms (Paola has so many MPs ready to be used) and found out that was Hua. Roland already hit Her few times, I asked for help and Chun came in and punched Her few times as well. Than I punched Her once and... Hua is dead. For Delzoup! We were from now Mush Free... But we didn't knew that actually. From this moment I started private channel with Ian about my suspicions - there were two people that technicly could be Beta Mush. One was Roland and another TuttiKuanTi. Roland was kind of... How to call Him? Lousy? Yea... Lousy player. I think He would be perfect player for Derek I think. Unfortunatly He had also tendency to stay in unmonitored rooms. That is bad. TuttiKuanTi on other hand was alone when repairing Oxy Tanks at some points... And I did remembered that there was something with Hua trying to fix them. I was stuck on bridge so I have no idea what happened really, but now - after Hua's rampage I saw with my imagination how she trapped both oxy tanks and spicked him somewhere in corridor when passing by. Was that possible? I DON'T KNOW! Why? Because I had my head in comms all the time. But I decided that better safe than sorry. We set plan with Ian - research RFS, inoculate TuttiKuanTi and kill Roland if we will not find proof that He is humman.</p><p>Roland was "found" to be humman very easily - I just reminded myself that He helped to kill Hua, while He could simply lie down all that time and do nothing. So I believed Him to be humman. Only TuttiKuanTi was left to suspect, so situation was simple, wasn't it?</p><p>But it never is simple really. TuttiKuanTi did His job very good - should I be Mush I would do it also very good, as Elemele was dead and there was no way to comfirm if we are Mush Free or not. I was thinking that He might be planing to return to Sol with us... In same time we got VERY UNLUCKY! Untill now we never got lot's of hunters in one wave. Now that we lost two of our pilots (Frieda and Hua) we were left only with Roland who was wasting AP on doing lot's of things apart from flying and shooting. We had Trail Minimiser, so what is the problem? We just move our ship! WRONG! We were VERY UNLUCKY as I said - after moving ship we had even more hunters to worry about &gt;.&lt; That was just... Aggggr!</p><p>Did I mentioned that PILGRED was at 0%?! Oh! I didn't? Well... Does not matter really, does it? After all who would be worried about such thing when we have no mush and we can simply rush it and... Oh! Wait! No Plasma Shields! And armor at 60~% So... Yea, we were kind of in a hurry. Jin Su was thinking about trying for Eden. Oh! And Oxygene was also finishing as three cycles in row we had broken Oxy Tank... Seriously - we were low on EVERYTHING! Hull, Oxygene, Crew, Food... Only Fuel was good.</p><p>We had two opposing ideas. I wanted Stephen to Apprientice Tech and finish PILGRED with TuttiKuanTi ASAP. Jin Su wanted Him to Apprientice Pilot (He was also Shooter) to help Roland to fend off Hunters. TuttiKuanTi took my side, so we outvoted Jin Su in the end. Rest was fight against time. In all this I and Ian were ploting what to do with TuttiKuanTi, but in the end we decided to simply trust Him being humman. Why? Reason is simply - Should I be Mush I would just say "TO HELL WITH THIS!" and would just let ship to blow up. There was too much frustration in coordinating all to worry about it while being a Mush.</p><p>How much were we desperate? To the point that I had to go and work on Armored Corridors with Ian (nobody else apart from TuttiKuanTi bothered to do so when we had 18 hunters!!!). Than I and Ian went on expo to bring oxygene from planet (Ian was NERON Admin so unlocked piloting for us and I set down Icarus - expedition went PERFECT! No bad event, 16 oxygene and Rolling Boulder). And finnaly I had to help TuttiKuanTi work on PILGRED at the end - but that one would be done without my help as Stephen came online at end and He would finish it with TuttiKuanTi without my help anyway. Still this way it was faster. And TuttiKuanTi was not Mush thanksfully <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
