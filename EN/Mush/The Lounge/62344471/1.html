                <p>Was an early waker as <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Frieda</strong> this most recent game, with most of the crew that was already awake lying silent in the Lab. I went about my way, doing some mandatory cleaning and organizing (moving hydropots and the apron and such) before I made a few standard threads, including my personal Astro thread. I then headed to Alpha Dorm to rest for a few cycles after my quick burst of activity.</p><p>By the time I wake again, a few more people have stirred, some from cryo, and others from their standing positions in the Lab. On the whole, the ship seemed to be a bit less active than average, which was a shame, but it was far from being totally devoid of activity. Most hunters had been taken care of by the resident Pilots in quick fashion, and there was a decent amount of progress on NERON and research (though still rather slow).</p><p>I took the opportunity to head up to the Bridge to scan for planets, finding two mostly useless specimens and reporting my dismay, as by this point, we had almost reached half <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico">, and I was worried that without a lucky break, we would be cutting it close. I returned to bed yet again, expecting not to return for a few cycles.</p><p>I wake up to find the ship in most okay shape, with most non-<img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> concerns taken care of. The plants have been abandoned due to an inactive <strong>Ian</strong>, but with no insurance policy for our dwindling <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> reserves, I had little reason to focus on anything but planet-searching. I manage to find one with <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> albeit not fully scanned, and satisfied with my work, decide to rest on the Bridge, with a seemingly inactive <strong>Gioele</strong> and a sleeping Logistics Expert <strong>Paola</strong> to keep me coming.</p><p>Our last arrival, <strong>Stephen</strong>, came shortly after, and I found myself on the side of <strong><em>Mush</em></strong>, with a very active <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> to boot. Immediately after selection, <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> and I began plotting our evil plan, with a somewhat-sluggish <strong>Jin Su</strong> providing us ample time to enact it.</p><p>We decided to use the threat of the low <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> supply to our advantage, capitalizing on the fact that by deleting my planet surreptitiously, it would be likely that we would have a scapegoat in our unwitting accomplice <strong>Jin Su</strong> when he moved us to where there was supposed to be a planet, and that with the crew distracted by organizing his demise, we would be able to watch the ship slowly suffocate.</p><p>After a few cycles of little happening except for a wave of hunters and a few <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> units being used up, we decided to speed up our plan by having me sabotage the <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> tanks right before cycle change and fly off with the rest of our supply in my pockets, leaving <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> as a mimic to watch the chaos unfold. <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> practiced her fake NERON messages in the <strong><em>Mush</em></strong> chat for a few cycles as we waited for the middle of the night.</p><p>As Cycle 3 began to dawn, I struck, using Phagocyte to fuel a tank-breaking spree, even lobbing a grenade in Bravo Dorm (where <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> was treating a few patients) to help <strong><em>Janice</em></strong>'s alibi. I waited in Alpha Bay 2, eager to take a ship to shoot any renaming traders offering :o2:, but with cycle change, I found that my partner was late to bat.</p><p>Later in the cycle, I returned to find that <strong>Paola</strong> and <strong>Stephen</strong> had beaten me to within an inch of my life, leaving me with a measly 1 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">. <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> had come online since my attack, however, and switched the BIOS lock, allowing me to fly off with only <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> left in the still-broken tanks. I made sure to swallow one last spore before I left to come back up to 5 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">, and waited for the ship to die off.</p><p>The next cycle, I came back to a death screen, courtesy of a rare Day 5 steel plate. I've just gotten word of the ship's end, and by the looks of it, our plan succeeded, though I'm excited to see just exactly how everything went down. If any of my crewmates are here, please let me know how it went after my unceremonious death!</p>

Because i didn't fix the tanks when i visited the storage, when we had no O2 anyway. So he tried to kill me claiming i would drop O2. He failed, and i spanked him because why not?
