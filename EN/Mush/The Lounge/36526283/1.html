                <p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2936" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2936</a><br>Caffeine addict bronze Gioele here. This was a fun ship, i just thought i'd share it since it got interesting near the end.</p><p>So near the end, there were three: Gioele, Finola and Ian. But before then...</p><p>We started out as a normal ship with an inactive jin su. Chun was active at the start but then never logged in again. <br>Stephen, Terrence, finola and janice were all gold. Skill books were pilot, astrophysics and medic. Finola took astro, janice took medic and i took pilot.</p><p>Right at the start, eleesha started punching raluca and claiming she was mush. Then raluca died because of sheet metal. Eleesha got quarantined.</p><p>It turned out our alpha mush were stephen and chao. I wasn't too worried about mush at the start but somebody quickly found out stephen, can't remember who it was but they asked him to post logs of him showering and he got found out because he forgot to remove the mush activity.</p><p>Then we had frieda who didn't speak english too well, eventually find a planet on day 3. Got the expo underway slowly after jin su died and chao moved us to the planet. We were suspicious of frieda and terrence because terrence took ages to dismantle the shower, and frieda was very slow to find us planets. <br>Pretty uneventful expedition, we did find oxygen and an invertebrate shell but most of the normally good events ended up hurting us.</p><p>When we moved away, chao suddenly killed chun and then mutated. Didn't expect that, but he didn't really do anything as a mutant, he pretty much just ran off to the opposite end of the ship and hid there. Don't really know why he didn't just move the ship when we were doing the expo and kill 4 of us at once but..<br>Frieda died from depression after that. No other casualties though.</p><br><p>And then we were fine from around day 4 onwards. We figured that all of the mush were dead and we did some productive human stuff. Got quite a lot of neron upgrades done, Paola ended up getting us like 5 of those. We somehow never got the shield though <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We were still suspicious of Hua and Terrence because they still hadn't really been very active and we weren't really sure what they were doing. Hua popped up the day after she went inactive, it turned out she didn't have a lot of time for the game.</p><p>We found another planet with the help of Finola and we quickly went to it because by that time i was the commander. That was the end of day 5.</p><p>Day 6 arrived, and when i woke up, everybody was dead. Everybody apart from Ian, Finola, myself, terrence, Janice and paola. I was almost dead on 5 HP. According to Terrence, he'd been body swapped with Paola and so he said Paola was mush. So we killed her. Nope. It was Terrence.</p><p>And then Janice said she was on zero morale. I ran up to the medlab to do the thing with her, but everybody who was still alive at that point was in the same room along with the camera. And i had no AP, along with everybody else in that room. We told her to take a pill or banana but she was full. No AP to stroke schrodinger, and she'd already done so. I couldn't give her a mission either because I'd already given one to Finola when i woke up.</p><p>So we had to let Janice go. In revenge myself and Finola blasted Terrence and kicked him in the face a few times and killed him since he was obviously the last mush.</p><p>And then we had a ship of 3 crew members who had no AP, 28 ship armour, 4 rations left and PILGRED at 41%. We decided to give repairing PILGRED a shot, but with no physicist or technician that would mean 1% progress each time. I didn't think our armour would last so i tried to get the last few hunters destroyed, since there was only 2 hunters outside and 2 araks, which i don't think do damage to the ship armour. But i had no AP. I made a few stupid decisions to spend my AP on rather than using the patrol ship to destroy the hunters or repairing the hull.</p><p>if either of us were a technician or if we had the shield, we could have been back to sol with only three people- but we had 28 ship armour and fires everywhere. We had 8 pieces of scrap laying around in alpha bay 2 (probably thanks to the quiet Hua), but nobody had AP to be able to repair the hull. Ian didn't have the botanist skill (he had the extra pot skill), so he had to spend his AP on the plants.</p><p>And then by D6C8, the ship exploded. I was expecting to last at least another 2 cycles, since i'm still not sure how ship damage works. The cycle before we only had taken 8 damage, but then we suddenly took 11 the next round, even with less hunters.</p><p>We never did explore the planet we were orbiting..</p>
