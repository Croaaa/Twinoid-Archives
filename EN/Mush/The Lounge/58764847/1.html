At first, we speak few words but... I do not want to talk about it.</p><p>I was coming up with plan to convert people. Eleesha was quiet to I took advantage of my yet lasting gold mode and picked up 4 skills -&gt; Splashproof + Phagocyte (accident I turned into benefit) + Infector + Anonymous.</p><p>I've spotted 4 people with starting spore: Hua, Paola, Chao, Jin Su.<br>It was convienient to be able to extract 4 spores. Not only I managed to convert Hua just for a decoy in later game, but also I regained all my energy to act as human*.</p><p>At the time, Eleesha turned inactive, Paola died and Chao was out of reach for my liking.<br>I was asked by Jin Su to scan for planets. I found 2 good and small planets to visit, perfect for solo expedition. It was perfect opportunity to make a big risk. I did. As I've forseen, Jin Su went solo on expedition for o2 on small planet I found (o2 + swamp). Once He came back, He already could take anonymoush. I was fast enough. Now, I had someone to work with.</p><p>We were planning to either convert Stephen (mostly targeted) or Janice (because her bloody knife love) but, turned out, that Janice being (trigger)blade-happy, we, or rather I, the suspect, had to act faster, before Her knife reach me (poor inactivities, my decoy and second alpha...).</p><p>Jin Su was a perfect spy... Wait. He was a perfect partner in crime. Communication was good, hadn't it in long time. No one noticed my shady move in icarus bay. We both were safe, before anyone checked, logs disappeared.</p><p>Now I wanted to go Dark Lord path and conquer the ship (as both of mushes were having dark skins and were "leader" types), but I could feel the knife being closer and closer, especially that I refused to work on PILGRED without Chun's word. Humans did it by themselfs. How convienient one could say. But no, we weren't satisfacted with returning to sol yet. We had to do something more before it. And so, Stephen joined our mission right at the end.</p><p>Funny thing, Jin took pic at the end. I took a pic early days on. Before He even joined me.<br><span class="tid_wspoil"><a href="https://imagebin.ca/v/3PPSXfyiV3nE" target="_blank">https://imagebin.ca/v/3PPSXfyiV3nE</a> dark lords of daedalus.bmp</span><br><span class="tid_wspoil">my end pic: <a href="https://imagebin.ca/v/3PPSyq5AnEgb" target="_blank">https://imagebin.ca/v/3PPSyq5AnEgb</a><br>yes, I wasted 10AP on scanning, minute before the end.</span></p><br><br><p>* - turned out to not work because no one was calculating it. Also, Janice and Stephen? claimed to see me doing less that I should. They did not take into account that there was never anyone to relay me or help with stuff, so not only my efforts to look like human and spend 100% "energy" went waste, I was still being suspected.</p><p>** - As it turned out, Janice took the bait of Hua not being damaged from starvation so they assumed Eleesha and Hua were probably alphas.

A few players were sleeping in the Lab. Some players had tutorial mode.</p><p>I was glad that <strong>Gioele</strong> listened to my instruction and closed tutorial mode. I don't even sad that he didn't keep playing and explore the game. At least part of my help has been accepted.</p><p>Mush selection happened when I was sleeping. Found myself staying human. Noticed that <strong>Ian</strong> discovered mush sample a started AG. Checked a few storage rooms in order to check starting book. Hid a grenade, got 3rd camera and installed it on the Bridge with Apron.</p><p>We had two pilots from start and the second pilot was Apprentice <strong>Stephen</strong>. He messed with scraps a tad and made me suspect him, though I knew that I have nothing better to deal with and focused on saving the ship from hunters along with Santa.</p><p>Time has come, two person became braindead in corridors and that made them being easy targets for simple conversion. Not a big deal, since I prefer to convert only active players. They help much more as <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"> <em>Darth Ti</em> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> noticed later.</p><p>We solved some hunters crises and O2 was a low and we had to look for a planet with O2. Since <strong>Frieda</strong> was a zombie, <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> had to replace her. By that time, people started to suspect him. Research went low and we had AG complete only with a half of CS.</p><p>I decided to do solo expedition, since a planet of <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> was small and safe. Also, I didn't want to invite another crewmates because they may get dirty or even spike in IB due lack of Paranoid cameras and Alarms. Got 8 units of Oxygen, 3 fruits and <em>two spores</em> right after the landing! Starting spore on me definitely helped to reach me true peace.</p><p>Returned to the game in time to get Anonymush with a hope that no one noticed that another mush appeared.</p><p>From my master, I found out my new family members : <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"> <em>Darth Zzz-ua</em> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hua.png" alt=":mush_hua_50:" class="tid_ico"> that didn't turn off tutorial mode even though I asked her at start and <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"> <em>Darth Elly</em> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico">. <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"> <em>Darth Zzz-ua</em> was like me, an apprentice of my master that joined <em><span class="tid_strike">Hive</span> Sith</em> recently.</p><p>Step by step I had to get Splashproof, Fertile and Phagocyte...

                <p>Janice here.</p><p>I admit I lulled myself into a false sense of security through the active chat, but at least it made the ship enjoyable rather than a lonely one with the very quiet but human Chun and Ian. Unfortunately I was not as active as I would normally like to be at the start of the ship, so couldn't do my close eye on all crew movements. I knew it was risky to create the group, but we had all been somewhat suspicious and/or Dirty so I gave them the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>We ended up excluding KT (who I thought was the most likely Alpha) but if anyone else had been converted I would have expected Stephen instead of Jin Su. Luck of the draw on starting spores, and the danger of expeditions even if taken solo. There wasn't enough suspicious activity to definitely murder KT; I thought that if he and/or Raluca was Mush he'd have been using Trapper and I would have long since been converted. Raluca was also suspicious due to time spent with Eleesha, my lack of knowledge of what she was doing, and what I thought was a Tech conspiracy to overplay the hull situation and rid us of all our weapons (which turned out to really throw KT).<br>We didn't really have the resources to keep KT trapped for the cure and as it turned out, he couldn't have Transferred into Jin Su because our Commander was already a Mush! I took the easy conclusion that we were lucky to get an inactive and barely active Mush selection, even with the high chance of conversion (as Jin Su will have passed on from our chat).</p><p>Overall, a better ship than I had hoped at the start, given we had - being generous - 50% activity.</p>
