                <p>Chao turned Finola here, out ship just finished up on day 13. We had a pretty decent run despite everything against us, so I'll list some things out:</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/finola_keegan.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FK:" class="tid_ico"> Was always our primary suspect, with as little as she did for the research and lying about starting a few that Chun had. Unfortunately for her, she chose to transfer into me, who had never had above have AP since the start of the ship.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/stephen_seagull.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_SS:" class="tid_ico"> Made a great commander after inactive Jin Su and Gioele finally got traded away.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/lai_kuan_ti.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_LKT:" class="tid_ico"> Shout out to the best first time player that I have ever encountered. I even suspected him halfway through the ship because he was so competent and well learned, but no, he was just a very competent new player.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/jiang_hua.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JH:" class="tid_ico"> Shout out to another very great new player, the most talkative I've ever seen.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/roland_zuccali.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RZ:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/terrence_archer.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_TA:" class="tid_ico"> Great job to our two pilots for keeping us alive against the greatest odds.</p><p>and above all, great job to everyone for making it as far as we did. It had all the makings of an Eden ship, despite only having half of the crew alive, we had nearly full shields and hull at all time, and all research accomplished. Our only failing was the inactive Janice and jin Su robbed us of reliable morale. But still, great work everyone.</p>

                <p>Terrence reporting in. It was quite convenient being a pilot and a tech, as I was able to easily juggle both skills with the help of a sprinter book (am I considered a cripple still?) Sorry about being gone for 2 days. I didn't expect to be on an active ship that would survive 10 days, but you picked up my slack <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. I never realized the reason why Eleesha didn't do anything was because she was in an accident. My best regards to her. I hope to meet you all on another ship (without half of the crew braindead)</p>

                <p>I need a mean counter for my last words. Any suggestions?</p><p>No? Didn't think so.</p><p>Just dropping in to say thanks for all the negative feed back in the mush channel. Especially the person who said I was <em>rude to everyone</em> regardless of the situation and <em>couldn't give me an example when I politely asked</em> for one. <strong>You rock!</strong> - when you don't have to stand to your words. Talking to you always turns miserable is also a very sweet thing coming from someone, who with the whole anonymity an ongoing ship comes with still has to hide in the mush channel to speak his mind. I should have kept a screenshot of all that crap and if I had known that after explaining my Paola thoroughly I would still be labelled as the bad one who ruined the atmosphere I certainly would have.</p>

                <p>Person with whom you made everything miserable reporting in, sorry I had thought that I labelled every post I sent your way, Regardless, there were multiple people in the channel that told you that you were taking things to far. It's one thing to RP someone who's angry, but reading your posts was just trudging through negativity and hostility far beyond what the post you were replying to warranted. I'm sorry that we didn't document every time you were rude to someone, but by that point I was so sick of dealing with you that I checked out of most of your posts. Regardless, you fired off on me when I asked you to tone it down with Stephen, I do remember you firing off on Chun though I can't remember the reason.</p><p>I'm sorry if you feel that the complaints against you were unwarranted, and if you still don't understand why we were upset with you after the long discussion in Mush chat I'm not sure I what I can tell you here other than the fact that your Paola was in the top five of the worst character's I've met on a ship.</p>

Why?</p><p>I don't do heavy RP on most mush ships but I have been a regular roleplayer in general for many years and I really think you need to read this: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6kxyq6/the_its_what_my_character_would_do_argument/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments...</a></p><p>Roleplaying is a cooperative activity, it's not a solo thing where you have your fun to the detriment of everyone else and it's okay because roleplaying.</p><p>FTR I was the first person to mention the rudeness in the Mush channel, and I did it there because there was anonymous rudeness <em>in the Mush Channel</em> and while I was 99% sure it was you I thought I would let you save some face with your heads-up that multiple people were getting super sick of it. I specifically and intentionally framed it as a general ship problem that we should all be trying to keep an eye on how rude we are being. But it's funny how you knew exactly what I was talking about anyway. It only turned to a conversation about Paola in particular after you copped to being the rude one.</p><p>EDIT: FTR I also gave you a heart in the end because I do appreciate that you changed your behavior when asked but now I'm really wondering how genuine that change of heart was. Pretty freaking disappointing.</p>

I'm a VERY HEAVY RP'er myself in almost all my ships, and you just gotta go arround my profile to check my past ships and see people in the endong screens praising my rp. Feel free to do so as well, even if you hadnt seen me.</p><p>Anyways <span class="tid_user tid_user_1850618 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1850618">Chime</span>, I guess Id come arround and give you a free unasked tips on rp, because Im such a charitable person, so that you dont get screamed at next time, since I'd love to see someone else start the RP in ships (besides of myself)</p><p>To be honest, I have no idea how can you be rp'ing and be so hated, like when I am Gioele I usually tell people that they are poor and therefore inferior, and how Jin is an incompetet commander for my ship <em>(and honestly, Jins are the ones I pick on the most but also the ones that enjoy it the most)</em>, a raluca I am alwayus reminding people how they are not even half as smart as me <em>(always with an irony touch of course, makes things funnier)</em> and as janice I get on eveyone via NERON vocoder <em>(Specially on myself, since it's easier to plan comebacks and all that stuff)</em> and so far people love that stuff as much as I do.</p><p>Besides of those three, and getting into the others:</p><p>Paola can be funny as hell, either you play it as daddy's kid or communist revolutionary. I tend to play it as second because <strong>THE COMUNITY IS SO ORIGINAL THAT THEY ALWAYS PLAY IT AS THE FIRST TYPE EVEN TOUGH SHE'S SUPPOSED TO HATE HER FATHER</strong>. Commie Paola is hella fun, specially with the general announcements, surely <span class="tid_user tid_user_1690378 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1690378">Aetrophes</span> can tell you, since he has seen me as such.</p><p>Kuan always must be patting himself on how great is the daedalus, and blame others when it malfunctions</p><p>Andie is just awesome. I always tell people they are infringing whatever article of &lt;insert name here&gt; intergalactic code law and always talk nice about the federation.</p><p>Chao, just be a psycho.</p><p>Roland is the only RP where if people tells you to stop, you're doing it right. Do puns always. Every time you talk The worse they are, the better is your RP.</p><p>Frieda.... Well I just play her as if she had lived since the start of history</p><br><p>And so on, just read biographies and use imagination, and you should be alright for future ships.</p><br><p>Now guess I should go, so see ya and hope i helped</p>

Why?</cite><p>Isn't that obvious? It's because I am a mean ill-natured person whose only joy in life is robbing others of their fun. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/chart.png" alt=":chart:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>I have no problem with you being upset. Or rather I'm sorry that you are upset. <br>Do you think I'm not upset or that I have no right/reason to be upset too? I haven't figured out what to write in my last words yet but I don't think the little space there will be enough to defend myself from Chun labelling me as the root of all evil. So you made an AP for the ship I was on too and I'm here because I have something to say about it. You may not want to read it and I can't force you to but I need to write this for myself because I am bothered by it and sitting in a corner to cry to myself is not an option.</p><p>Now while I still have access to the general chat I have no screenshots of the mush channel so bear with me explaining things again. (I'm a forgetful person I'll forget the details if I don't.)</p><p>Let's summarize: after being slime trapped, accused of mushiness and being made a pariah my Paola picked a fight with the one who publicly convicted her: Stephen. There are numerous ways to deal with an angry character you choose to ignore it, Stephen as someone who doesn't really role play said 'i explained why i have concerns. hate me.' (I took him up on the offer) and Chun decided take the fight and battle it out. I can draw clear connections between everything Chun and Paola said so if you were bothered by that quarrel ... remember that there are two people needed for an argument.</p><p>First though Finola outed herself by transferring into Chao and attacking Raluca and Stephen stood in Paolas way of revenge. Revenge is petty? Yeah and it looked like some sort of sick twist of fate to me that it was Stephen who guarded FC there. So Paola got some more angry. And because I noticed this was going in a not so good direction I made an OC post<em> to clarify that I don't mean to insult anyone on a personal level</em> and that I <em>would tone it down if someone felt offended or bothered</em> by it. The only ones answering to that were Kuan and Chun who said she didn't feel insulted and that my RP was <em>"both welcome and non-offensive!"</em>. ... Funny, right?</p><p>We got Pheromodem and as I said before I didn't keep screenshots but I think at first we were just explaining things for Hua who thought she was mush. I have no idea what that anonymous rudeness is you are referring to (but thanks for assuming it was me right away) but ~2 days after we got Pheromodem while I was continuing my quarrel with Chun in the thread for the first expedition the topic in the mush channel suddenly brought up rudeness and yes why of course I though it was aimed at me since I was just being very rude to Chun. So I explained my Paola and Chao threw in his piece of mind. Yes Chao did sign some of his messages but the thing is: not all messages are signed, whenever you forgot to sign some or other people took part in this discussion I do not know. I can not know. There was even a message that started with "I think you know who I am" to which I could only answer "No" because I didn't and couldn't. You said it yourself that there <em>were multiple people in the channel telling me I was taking things to far</em>. Multiple people hiding their identities in the mush channel, taking the opportunity to tell me off as group of an unknown size ganging up on me, approximately 2 days after the mush died <em>approximately 2 days after I asked whenever someone felt offended</em> by my Paola. Approximately 2 days after nobody came up to say hey I feel bothered. I was told I would be rude to everyone. I asked polity for an example. I know I was polite. I said it wasn't my intention to be rude to everyone and asked for an example so I would know what to look out for - to improve myself. You didn't give me one though. And now you tell me that you didn't document every time I was rude to someone. Did I ask for a documentation? Did I ask for a list? I asked for one simple example. You could have scrolled down and picked one out if I really was rude to everyone. You didn't, because I actually wasn't rude to everyone or because you were "so sick of dealing with me" that you just threw all that criticism at me and left without looking back. Which isn't a polite thing to do, now is it?</p><br><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> <br>So. You are upset because I am negative, hostile and rude and thus ruined the atmosphere. You already explained it to me more or less anonym in the mush channel a 'discussion' that naturally was erased 24 hours later. The explanation was along the lines of: you are rude to everyone, you are actually not role playing but just using role play as an excuse to be mean and you are ruining the atmosphere.</p><p>While I am upset about the fact that an unknown number of people ganged up on me in the mush channel, hiding behind the anonymity of the mush channel, laying down their assumptions as facts, ignoring my explanations, not backing up their accusations. Getting blamed for your inability to deal with an angry character / create the pleasant atmosphere I supposedly ruined.</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_295850 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="295850">zyzzyvette</span></span><cite><p>EDIT: FTR I also gave you a heart in the end because I do appreciate that you changed your behavior when asked but now I'm really wondering how genuine that change of heart was.

If you are asking whenever I'll only role play sunshine and rainbows in the future: no I wont.</p><p>Freaking disappointing is when you ask if someone feels bothered and no one says yes but two days later you find yourself against a wall in a pitch black room. Freaking disappointing is when the person whose role play you enjoyed and who to the question if they felt offended or bothered said no says you ruined the ship with your hostility at the end rather than getting back to the initial question the moment they started feeling uncomfortable.</p><br><br><br><p>And thanks <span class="tid_user tid_user_8514952 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8514952">havi</span> but I'm not sure where the tip in that post was. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico"> <br>I've been around for a few years I roughly know the bios of the characters and I don't usually get screamed at... which is why I am so upset with being put in the pillory.</p>

                <p>The rudeness in the Mush channel I'm referring to is you bursting at the seams to call Raluca a total idiot for choosing to genius the pheromodem, when you had no idea of the context and didn't bother to ask. As I said I didn't name you on that, because I wasn't 100% sure and didn't think it mattered. I asked that we as a ship tone down the rudeness, and at that point <em>you chose to identify yourself</em> as the person being rude. And when we did ask you to stop, repeatedly, you went on and on about how we should be OK with it OOC because you felt it made sense IC, which is when the discussion escalated. You admitted that your character was being obnoxious, and you seemed to understand that the impact was not limited to our characters, but you wanted to keep going anyway because you cared more about your own fun than everyone else on board combined.</p><p>I'm sorry but it's totally out of line and unfair for you to try to paint yourself as a victim in this. What you did was a basic breach of RP etiquette, and arguably a breach of the Mush rules (be civil, don't harm your team). It isn't your untouchable prerogative to <em>intentionally</em> design and play a version of Paola that is the most abrasive, obnoxious, and anti-teamwork version possible, then persist like this for several days to the point of negatively affecting the operation of the ship (inc picking fights in the Mush hunt chat), and if people don't like it it's because they just "can't deal" with your "role-playing". The Mush channel was not the first time you were asked to tone it down, but when you were asked outside the Mush channel to tone it down, you used it as an excuse to "roleplay" more obnoxiousness.</p><p>What you did on that ship was objectively-speaking<em> bad RP</em>. There are very few things in RP that can make it <em>objectively</em> bad - most are a matter of taste - but <a target="_blank" href="https://www.partialarc.com/articles//how-we-roll-24-its-what-my-character-would-do">this is one of those things</a>. At a certain point, it doesn't matter anymore whether that's what your character would do or not. <em>You're</em> the one who decided to make her that way. "Paola Rinaldo" is not a real person, <em>you</em> are. At the end of the day, it is you and only you who is responsible for "Paola's" behavior on that ship.</p>

                <p>Since I've now also been directly referred to I'll put my name on the record slightly earlier than the system requires.</p><p>I was the <strong>Chun</strong> for this ship, and I have been having private messages with <em><strong>Chime</strong></em> since she announced herself to me as the <strong>Paola</strong> not long after the ship finished although not fast enough for me to have not written my last words.</p><p>I have little to add to the drama side of the discussion that hasn't already been said to <strong><em>Chime</em></strong> directly or already mentioned here, the ship itself was a decent ship and could easily have gone on much longer had we not lost our <em>shrink</em> to inactivity although we did manage to sustain her to day 10/11 before losing her.</p><p>Our Mush were largely screwed following what seems to have been a genuine car accident for one of the alphas <strong><em>Eleesha</em></strong>, who said they had suffered concussion in the accident and car was wrecked so was naturally gone dealing with these things. This being Mush I automatically assumed this was an inactivity cover but it seems to have been genuine as they never returned. This left an alpha <strong><em>Finola</em></strong> to do what she could, which sadly wasn't much.</p><p>Had I known it was <em><strong>Chime</strong></em> behind the <strong>Paola</strong> I would have approached the situation differently and naturally wouldn't have called her out in my last words, should that be the case however? No, but since my limited previous experiences with her however have been positive I would have acted differently and so say here as I have in PM that <em>I am sorry to have left the last words that I did.</em></p>

                <p>Yes I did say that Raluca wasted her Genius if it was used on Pheromodem because our hull was crumbling and we had a hardly touched Plasma Shield offer in the Nexus. I can not remember calling her an idiot though.</p><p>I can see that you are so hang up on the phrasing 'it's what my character would do' that you didn't give a damn about anything I wrote about my character. You <em>assume</em> that I understood your point of view and that I or my Paola had a change of heart later on but you <em>know</em> that I was being obnoxious for my own fun and intentionally designed my Paola to be uncooperative, abrasive and obnoxious. Now that you are mentioning it... how could I forget that I'm a mean ill-natured person and I jumped on the ship to ruin things. I had no idea that was my intention and I actually believed I knew my own intentions best so thank you for reminding me.</p><br><p>And I'm not painting myself a victim I'm simply not accepting that I am the only one to be blamed for you not enjoying the ship. Aswell as telling you (and when I say you I don't necessarily mean you zyzzyvette or your Ian) what upset me. Telling me I'm being unfair or out of the line for stating my viewpoint / what upset me is the epitome of unfair though. Since it's okay for everyone aside from me to say what they think while I am apparently not worthy of having an opinion on the issue or feelings that could be hurt. And since you (Ian) are still hung up on your favourite pet-peeve phrase and apparently don't get what I've been trying to say I'll try again:</p><br><p><strong>Next time you</strong> (not necessarily you Ian) <strong>tell someone what bothers you about their character or whatever, honestly whatever it is: do it in gc or a pn not in mush channel. Because the person being the target of the critique can not see who is talking to them, how many there are and it's just freaking uncomfortable like being pushed down the stairs in the dark.</strong> And if you criticism is well meant try to no exaggerate as in "rude to everyone", "all the time" when it's not true and you find yourself incapable of providing an example. If you criticise something and are asked for an example give one it's the least to do otherwise it's just self-righteous crap.</p><p>That was the one thing and the other is Chuns/Enigmas last words. I enjoyed your Chun I really did, partly because you were role playing and partly because hardly anyone else bothered to interact with my Paola. I didn't really like the direction it was going but until you apologized for wanting to stab me (a statement from Chun that totally fitted the relationship Chun and Paola had at that point) for it being out of character I had no idea that you didn't want to go in that direction. I don't know if you participated in the discussion in the mush channel... since it was in the mush channel. So to me it was &gt;starting RP, all good &gt;RP going in a not so nice direction but no sign of you wanting to change the direction &gt;'you ruined the atmosphere' &gt;wait what?</p><br><p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_295850 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="295850">zyzzyvette</span></span><cite>The Mush channel was not the first time you were asked to tone it down, but when you were asked outside the Mush channel to tone it down, you used it as an excuse to "roleplay" more obnoxiousness.</cite> Where? I still haven't confirmed the end so where? Aside from Chun hardly anyone bothered interacting with my Paola. Yes Paola was in a dislikeable mood but nobody tried to get her out of it. I know that it's not the duty of the other players to do so, but you could have tried instead of assuming that whatever or whoever talks to her would be lashed out at. That's something I pointed out when I explained my Paola too but you choose to get hung up on your pet-peeve phrase instead. So rather than talking to Paola you, except for Chun who took up the glove, decided to wait if it clears up on itself and when it didn't because I was having fun arguing with Chun even though it didn't help Paola get out of that mood you went and told me my RP was bad and that I'm using it as an excuse for being rude. Again, thanks for clarify my intentions. I'll get back to you if I'm ever unsure of my own though process. Yes my Paola is my Paola and she is the way she is because I write her the way I do - my responsibility. It's not your responsibility to help her get out of the bad image she drove herself in but if you have a problem with her and <em>wait</em> until you can't bear it any more and lash out against me then that's your responsibility not mine.</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_295850 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="295850">zyzzyvette</span></span><cite>Also I don't think you get it, the fact that I asked for some more politeness in the Mush channel was meant to be a<em><strong> benefit for you. </strong></em> It makes absolutely no sense that you're simultaneously upset that Enigma complained in a super-permanent way that targeted you and I complained in a super-temporary way that didn't target you (until you made it that way).

I didn't know your intentions then and it obviously didn't work out that way (sounds familiar?) but thank you for trying. A PN would have been a better place for it though but really appreciate the intention to help. I'm not pissed of by the feedback, I'm upset about time &amp; place as well as the fact that others are deciding what my intentions are and point blank ignoring what I say they are. And yes I can be upset about both the temporary as well as the permanent complain. It's like being pushed down the stairs to the basement and another person locking the door behind you. Falling down the stairs hurts momentary - while being locked in is... well ask me in a year I probably wont remember the pain from falling down the stairs but I could have did of starvation in the basement by then.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><p>---<br>Now I've spend hours on explaining my viewpoint. If you don't get it you probably don't want to get it - &amp; I don't care because I didn't explain my viewpoint to ruin your fun little AP but because putting it in words helps me.</p>
