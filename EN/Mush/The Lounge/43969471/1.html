                <p>Hello. This is old man Gioele.</p><p>The ship:<a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6561"></a><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6561" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6561</a> start off pretty nicely. I've been first to awake, but this was first cycle of the first day, so we have extra bananas and coffee, and all looked good at that time. Soon, at the end of cycle 8 of the same day, ship was filled, and then first problem have arised.</p><p>I'll try to put all my thoughts there, please, complete them with your points of view, my crewmates.</p><p>Actually, our crew was divided into "active and vocal" part (sometimes less-active, but still vocal), "active, but silent" part, and finally, "part, I know nothing about". <br>Active part consists of Paola (she works miracle with Xyloph, but has really bad luck with project she get from Neron upgrading), Frieda (does some scan, but due to same bad luck there were nothing good and then we focused on short-term survival), Ian (does all he can and should and even little more), Jin Su (he was good, but he was online only half of cycles, which too add to our doom - since mush have stole our Hacker's Kit in the beginning), and me. Most of us were bronze, some silver and gold. Oh, and there was Roland - bronze too, he was our best pilot. Unfortunate accident made him leave the ship to hunt at just the same moment commander moves out. <br>This wasn't a first moment of miscommunications, but it was one standing out. Roland didn't read Jin Su's post about moving out in two minutes. When I've noticed he left the dorm, I've post a warning to him - but too late. Then I post a warning to Jin Su - but it goes unnoticed too. And then Jin Su moved us - probably without doing a headcount. So, Roland was our first loss. And we did not learn from his death much.</p><p>Next in line should be mentioned Terrence - who need to be given personal credit. He was good with drones. But unfortunately, I should word this exactly that way. We were not able to cooperate, so neither Jin Su, nor Frieda(as one of the most vocal players) nor me managed to get a common language with him. This also add points to the unsurprising end.</p><p>Next point I want to made, considering unactive or "laying in wait" players. We have Eleesha as last awakened player, and I hoped she will be active participator in mush hunt. But at one day she (and _that_ is the point) without any notifications, or nothing like that - go out and stabbed Derek (wandering around ship, absolutely silent). Next cycle he died from starvation, and she focused on Raluca(Raluca was vocal one at first, but then silent). And this was second time when miscommunication hit the fan. I asked her about what was going (in a global chat), asked all private contacts I had at the time. Some were saying "Immediate death" but we decide to wait. I've kicked Eleesha out of the bed (so that rampage cannot be continued) and asked Ian to go to our dorm - so that rampage will be harder. And I remind you, there were another thread about Eleesha misbehaviour - still, no answer from her. And when later (after 2-3 cycles) Ian left, she stroke Raluca again. And again - in silence, returning to bed after three hits. We have no clues, no ideas, and while Raluca was, probably, a mush, a potential griefer was way more dangerous - so I've killed her. Raluca was put under suspicious, and if at the end of the day she will not died by herself(being inactive, she should getting starved already), we decided we will kill her. But then Terrence come, finished her (first Mush out) and run away.</p><p>But I can stand people, don't giving a thing about what other said - as long as they, at least, say something about that in turn. Terrence was uncooperative, but he didn't hid it - so we can do plans including his behaviour. What strike me hard - was our two resident gold players, Hua and Andie -- both were pilots, and both add little to nothing to game chat. This made planning harder, and because Hua didn't reported some of Neron Upgrades she did - Kuan Ti (nice move, KT) was able to add some of this to his credit. At that point, crew list look for me that way. <br>Chun, Ian, Frieda, Paola and me were proven humans. <br>Jin Su wasn't proved, but even if he was a mush, I can respect a player who decide to win by playing, not by "waiting for a ship fall out without him". So we trusted him too. <br>Terrence wasn't proved, was acting weird, and we wasn't agree about him - but at least he was active and done some speeches (mostly about me being jealous, last word misspelled in a many different ways). <br>And we have a crew of strange people: KT, Janice, Stephen, Andie and Hua. All of them were suspicious. Three of them were silver or better, so I expect a bit more "communication skills" from them. And nothing can help us to choose. <br>First notice was breaking Neron Core, and a cycle later - Bios. We suspected there were something about, but didn't managed to point it down to KT. Later, one huge warning was broken drone. As soon as I checked there were no spikes in the room with him, I know for sure that someone of KT, Hua or Terrence was a Green Jelly mush. Unfortunately, neither commander, nor "proven team" managed to come to conclusion who to kill, and my request to kill KT was left unanswered. If we do that - than may be, we managed to come back to Sol. But history knows no "if", so... it ends the way it ends. KT awakened, tossed a grenade, mutate, kill me, try to kill Chun, and next cycle Daedalus was full of holes. <br><br>Now, I want to point some things to those, who will read it from my crew; <br>1. Please, please - communicate. Hua, if you were more vocal, we could narrow our suspects list way better! Eleesha, your death message was about you should reporting be for killing you, and need to communicate - there were not one, but two threads in discussion channel about your behaviour, yet you answer to non of them. This was when you fate was decided. <br>2. I can hardly respect "let's wait and see ship falling", even if this is viable strategy for mushed. Nice move from you, though. was stealing the Hacker's Kit, and if Eleesha come to the Storage, she probably could trace you down.. but no such luck. <br>3. Some trigger-happiness is understandable, but this ship has too much of it. Bickering between Frieda, Terrence and me can be more useful, but again - no such luck. <br>So... miscommunication killed the cat. Along with the ship. Not poor Neron work(but that too), but first and foremost - lack of cooperation. We could do it to sol even with empty Neron, but - no such luck. <br><br>And last, but not least. I want to say "wow" to some of crew roleplaying. There weren't a lot of it, but Paola(<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico">) was great, Raluca was good too - before she went silent and absent.</p>

                <p>Frieda here,</p><p>I've had my bad luck, failed scanning with 99%, got O2 zones with seismic, volcanic and then took up a generalist job extinguishing fires, repairing stuff.. Some ships aren't worth an AP thread and this is surely one.</p><p>There's little to talk about most of the crew since either I wasn't in touch or they didn't bother to communicate. I'd list some annoying factors that made this a fail ship. The supernovas are screwed, Gioele should get gold, Ian should get silver and Chun bronze. <span class="tid_strike">The rest of the crew should get 10 SDF points. </span></p><p>Eleesha - Absolutely ZERO communication; Eleesha's last words seem too absurd, If she knew Raluca was mush why does she have to kill Derek without consulting Chun in the first place?</p><p>Terrence - The perfect example of how to play mush. (Cooperation, Always reporting he is dirty and ensuring he won't get, Making sure Pilgred doesn't progress higher, Calm and friendly) <strong><em>NOT</em></strong></p><p>Hua - Experienced with tech, Gold and does almost everything from research, nexus to botany except piloting (<em>Most of the time</em>).</p><p>Andie - Wake up, Research, Sleep, rinse and repeat. (And he/she being a pilot)</p><p>Raluca - Great Alpha trapper, She convinced us to progress pilgred to 60% while I tried to stop her. (I missed her once she went inactive)</p><p>Kuan Ti - Not sure if worst or smart, Did absolutely nothing that is beneficial to the ship or to the mush.</p>

                <p>Actually, KT does some good moves. He stole Hacker's Kit (good for Mush), slimed Neron core (good for mush too, but Terrence fix it quickly), slimed Bios(not so important, but still can give us some trouble), and probably, he and Raluca were waiting for chance to hijack ship and go to Sol. (and they can do it, since Jin Su was spored). Actually, if they were just a littlest bit more active, it will be clear mush win.<br>I don't know why he slimed drone. This was a mistake.</p>
