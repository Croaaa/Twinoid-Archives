Day 12, shields and armour looking good, an active crew with plenty of fuel and oxygen left. I really feel we could have had a serious crack at Eden, but the Daedalus went berserk with steel plates on us and we weren't keeping up. RIP in peace, Janice and Hua <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Everything went pretty nicely as the Comms manager, I just kind of chilled in the bridge and did my job all game. Never quite had enough AP to go round, it must be nice for some people having an extra 6AP every day from missions... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>What was it like for the rest of you?</p>

                <p>Jin Su here. We could've had a shot at Eden if the crew were a little more active (for healing from steel plates etc.) and if Hua had been active for more of the game. (we gave up a lot of time trying to repair PILGRED with no technicians). Still, that was quite a good ship, and I was glad to be on it! It's nice pressing that return to Sol button myself for a change.</p><p>I'd be interested to know how the mush hunt went, from the mush and/or from the mush hunters. All I know is a mush hunt channel decided to kill Eleesha and Kuan Ti from being suspicious (KT being mush, Eleesha human) and then Derek killed Chun and was killed.</p><p>I was on an expedition when that happened, with no trakie. It isn't nice to see that a human died with no idea of who died, who killed them, and why. Then a mush died and I wasn't as worried. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>The mush hunt was actually very inactive in the early game, nobody seemed to be that interested other than Andie. We were also short on suspects honestly, both Mush were very low-key and didn't do many Mushy things. Kuan Ti was our only real suspect, simply because of his eagerness to rush Pilgred and how often he had been dirty. Thankfully we turned out to be right <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Eleesha died as we believed her to be very suspicious, she was active without apparently really doing anything with her AP and not really communicating. She didn't seem like a newbie on the few occaisions when she did speak, but unfortunately we were wrong about her and wrongfully killed her. It happens, this is Mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Derek caught me by surprise, I don't remember him really doing anything. Then suddenly out of the blue he appears on the bridge, kills Chun, goes "I AM THE MUSH BWAHAHAHA" and is promptly curbstomped.<img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> I get the feeling he was probably inactive for several days, which would be why he never did anything to raise suspicion.</p><p>The only reason you weeren't brought into the loop is that Andie was sort of suspicious of you still, and honestly I forget why now. Was over a week ago, crikey!</p>
