                <p>Hey everyone! Stephen here from <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3886" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3886</a> .</p><p>What a successful ship! We could have kept going for sure, but I wouldn't want anyone to miss out on Eden when we all did so well. Roland, Frieda, and Paola - you lived on in our memories and we made special memorials for you on Eden! I found an old mop to commemorate Frieda, one of those broken downloads that goes past 100% for Paola, and I just told Roland Jr. that his daddy died a hero by this sharp piece of metal that still has his blood stained on it.</p><p>So, how about a summary for the appetizer? It all began with Janice derping around dirty, only talking on the chat after Eleesha kept calling her out. I was focusing my efforts on Research at the time so I was more worried about Ian, who came back after mush assignment about the same time I did and only pinged Antispore Gas for me once before begging for a bed and roaming around the ship. Oh, how I -wanted- to follow him out into Front Corridor after I saw he was there for a good minute. But I cook my MP well, see, so I refused to waste it on such a longshot. Well, midshot. My eyes were on him.</p><p>We actually let Janice go for way too long, mostly because this entire crew was active, not a single inactive. We knew that we were going far after the mushies died, so we couldn't be reckless. I keep saying 'we' as if I played a major role in the mush hunt, but all that credit goes to *Eleesha* and a few others. I was actually bowling IRL when most of the Janice discussion was going on. I put in my vote to kill the shroom, but we would need to decide if I should Seagull her Shrink out of her before Derek slapped her <span class="tid_strike">down the alley</span> into Alpha Bay to pop a cap on her so no one in the dorm would start thinking that the death of a mush was something to develop a psychological problem over. It was a hard choice because I could have had Andie's Polyvalent, maybe we could have used another Pilot (Yeah right), or even a Technician! No, I knew what I had to do. I made an executive decision and gazed into that mushroom's eyes and felt as if I were going to swallow her whole before suddenly growing a green spindle in my hair. Devouring her soul turned out to be the right choice, because oh man, we needed that Shrink.</p><p>So Derek popped her full of lead in the next room and there was much rejoicing. One down! I stretched out and sat back because my new job was to stand over people in their sleep and whisper sweet words of inspiration for them. Someone else should detail this part more, because all I saw was<br>&lt;Stand-in actors&gt;<br>*Ian*: stahp, ur hurtin me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br>*Neron*: Oh dear. There appears to be a red substance over the walls. I hope you humans intend to clean up after yourselves? &lt;Ian: Assassinated&gt; Mush #2 down!</p><p>Geez, I didn't do much mush hunting at all :/ But that's okay, because I was preparing a delicious feast of heals, manhugs, and..god, that's all that I've done for the past 20 days, hasn't it? I need to roll mush for once.</p><p>So we had an awesome crew. Everyone was active, so we weren't able to test out slave trading. We had a Shooter book for Jin Su, a Pilot book for Derek, and a Technician book for Eleesha. We worked Paola harder than a dirty Finola in the shower on the Neron Updates, so hard that I fear she broke under the pressure as she continued updating after all the projects were done. But she was a good gal, pretty sure she contributed some data to the wiki or another forum post. Of course, Plasma Shield was the LAST thing we got but hey, with Captain Pumpkin, Muscle Hogan, Rololand Daddy, HuaaAAAWYEAH, Wheels, and Mr./Ms. Andie taking down hunters, who needed that?</p><p>So that's basically it. We flew for a good 3 weeks together, visiting the unknown and acquiring many an artifact (I still miss my Invertebrate Shells that Chun blew up). Eventually, the traders just stopped coming. Guess they didn't feel like being around D1000's and dozens of other hunters.</p><p>But what is dinner without desert? Fear not, the great chefshrink Stephen Seagull is always prepared.</p><p><em>Captain <strong>Jin Su</strong> Pumpkincula </em>- You did a great job staying on top of missions to Andie and hunters. Always glad to see an undead Captain hovering over me while I sleep giving me Logistics advice. Cheers to you, sir!</p><p><em>Officer <strong>Paola</strong> ver 10.12 WINDOWS HAS CRASHED </em>- Holy cow girl, you broke Neron! How did you enjoy being one of the first Paolas in the new season? It's too bad we couldn't get any good deals out of those traders. You were a little on the quiet side sometimes, but you did good.</p><p><strong>Frieda</strong> <em>Starscream</em> - What awesome planets you found for us! I'm sorry the Daedalus assassinated you, I wish I could have been there in time. I am reminded of you every time I look at that mop gazing up into the stars.</p><p><strong>Andie. Mr./Ms. Andie</strong> - I'm so glad you had gold mode and decided to power up Andie! I saw all those early posts about "Ew Andie" and "I miss Finola!" and dismissed them like my first alarm in the mornings before work. You, sir/mam, have shown just how awesome Andie is. I could have died from Depression if not for you, also we all could have died on expos. You didn't need no stinkin' Medic to knock all that research out, just Chun and Gioele. A+ sir/mam, A+!</p><p><em>Knock knock! Who's there? <strong>Chun</strong>, knocked up!</em> - Holy crap is that you Nathan0? Do you have any idea how long it's been since we flew together? What were the odds! So awesome to fly with you again, even if you did move my shells (I know they're not mine, but I liked them ;_; ) to CAT and they blew up the next cycle. Awesome job Chuning and staying on top of everyone's :hp:! Although, I'm surprised to see that you're still in Bronze mode. You really should get Silver, it's worth it.</p><p><em><strong>Eleesha</strong> Fixit </em>- Yeah, that's your last name. That's why you couldn't conceive, you little mush hunting Daedalus fixing awesome little lady. I know you got that tech skill by playing retro Disney video games. And it sure came in handy!</p><p><em>Mr. <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> Freeze</em> - Ah, my partner in cuisine! It's too bad we didn't have a mountain of rations to make for everyone, but we did have a decent amount. Your work all throughout the ship was spectactular and I'm glad you were able to help me freeze steaks when I wasn't around to do it. You should get Silver mode too!</p><p><em><strong>Raluca</strong> the Itty Bitty Kitty </em>- How many times did I walk out into Rear Corridor to take a nice, relaxing break only to find you bleeding in a corner? Goodness woman, if we lost you to the Daedalus too then a lot of things would have stayed broken! Great work on Pilgred and keeping us able to move around.</p><p><em><strong>Gioele</strong> and the Elixir of Life </em>- Mr. Rinaldo, my life felt complete the moment I entered your sacred grounds and performed the magical ritual for the first time on one of the few cycles you were not actually around for. WHERE would we have gone without you and your potions of power? If I had a dime for every report I saw by Gioele, I could buy Gold Mode for Chun, Kuan Ti, Raluca, and Frieda. It was an honor to fly with you and your coffee, sir.</p><p><em>Do me <strong>Derek</strong></em> - I have to say, you seemed to carry a kind of 'jock' personality that seemed perfect for Derek. Finding a Pilot book was the best thing for you. You were worth waltzing into Alpha Bay 2 every couple of cycles to check up on, A+ to you sir for your piloting and showing that we don't need Chao to beat up a couple mushes, especially an Ian mush.</p><p><strong></strong><em>This plant is diseased <strong>Hua</strong>gain?</em><strong></strong> - I'm so glad you had Botanist Hua, your dual skills between backup piloting and plant control were top notch! Be very proud of yourself for ushering in an era of Jumpkins, the fruits of our labors! We might have lost someone towards the end of the ship if we didn't have all those jumpkins to eat. It was an honor to carry your plants and help water them.</p><p><strong>Terrence</strong>,<em> the Wheels of Heals</em> - My earliest memory of you is that after deducing the Bridge was likely hit by a power surge, I pushed you towards it and you got everything fixed up before Paola could come back and beg us to fix her terminal. How did you even -do- that? I banged on the Tabulatrix once and failed, you fixed the sofa, all the terminals, even the camera that we didn't even need! And that was just the START, you were all over the place later on fixing things and taking out those hunters! We didn't even NEED the plasma shield because of you guys. Great work, crips!</p><p>Well, I think that's everyone. It was--oh yeah..I forgot two..<br><strong>Ian</strong> - You probably saw my response to your death, but if I were in your shoes, I'd have just helped Stephen finish Antispore Gas. It's going to get completed anyway; why prolong it? You can earn human trust by doing so, which is exactly what mush Ian has to survive on. You fight with manipulation and cunning. And if you'd have helped me, I would have stopped them from coming after you.<br><strong>Janice</strong> - I...did you even speak English? I hope you learned a thing or two from us about being dirty and making obvious mistakes. I can see that one of you managed to get Hua somehow, so I imagine you two would have become a threat if we hadn't put you down as quickly as we did. <br>Regardless, you two did your duty to the mush and you should be proud for it. I'm sorry that you couldn't fly on this ship with us, I'd have liked to have cured Ian after Janice died but I don't think we had the disk yet and I wasn't even on for Ian's death.<br><br>Well, that's the gist of it. I know I didn't sound at all like this in our ship but I wanted to tone down on the chat lag <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Thank you all for a good flight, I've already added you all as contacts and I hope we get to fly again!</p>

                <p>Derek Here (I swear there was a way to post the character icons here..)</p><p>10/10 sir. I remember murdering that disgusting mushroom Ian. Hours spent frantically waiting for <em>anyone</em> to drop one of the blasters, to no avail. I had to roll up my sleeves and just give him a good old fashioned punching. Thanks to Paola and I think Eleesha hurting him a bit, the absolute last hit I could make on him killed him. I told Gioele to write down something cool I said while murdering him, who sadly failed to deliver.</p>
