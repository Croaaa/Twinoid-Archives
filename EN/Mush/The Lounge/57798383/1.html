Roland launched alone into a planet which had monsters and got killed in first zone, Andie launched outside without saying anything and died. Soon we were only having one pilot on the board and crew kinda was inactive but, happily we kept it together and done pretty good. At first planet we got O2 and fuel, then continued on to the space.</p><br><p>I learned piloting from Hua, and read shooter book, with Creative in my pocket, I turned into a monster! I say even though I missed alot but, it was pretty fun to empty two patrol ship in one cycle xD or kill waves after waves of hunters! Crew were good as well, we killed first mush which was inactive, kinda got best projects and finished them with help of NP (neron), research weren't done that quickly but Paola wasn't going to play mushy so it wasn't a problem. Slowly more people died and got killed till we finally had one suspect on our list. (It was funny how in one cycle three people got confirmed by double eating <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">) So we cured her and kept going strong from there.</p><br><p>Crew was actually pretty lucky in some points, we were lucky with planets and exploring them. In our last trip we lost dodged a death zone and got the last starmap! It was actually my first eden after playing for this long! It is kinda funny but I can say, I really enjoyed!</p><br><p>This post is free for those people who want to share their story or tell their thoughts and stuff.</p>

Incomplete?</p><p>Perhaps here, on <em>New Eden</em>, she would regain that which she had lost.</p></span></div><p>This was a surprisingly nice voyage! I made the decision to pick and play <strong>Chun</strong> after running into a string of inactive <strong>Chun</strong>'s in recent randoms and with no sign of the Mush for over a week and crew and pilots dying or being killed I was worried that we'd just fizzle out, getting as low as 30 something hull without any scrap onboard, only 2 <em>pilots</em> left, one of which I expected to go inactive and abandon us, we managed to finish with new full oxygen and fuel tanks, a fully charged shield (Before we let it get battered on finding the last fragment) and the hull back to 81%.</p><p>With no Mush hunt to write about though I'll spare everyone my usual story walls, and instead hit you were a "special mention" wall instead, the story here is pretty much that with luck, and so long as people don't give up on you, you can last waaaaaay longer than you might think!</p><p>---<br><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/janice_kent.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JK:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Janice</strong> - You were a pleasure to have on board and when you were confirmed felt like the point the game turned for me, I love anyone who makes NERON part of the crew, and despite your constant panic attacks you were there for us when we needed you! Starting with 5 x +3 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico"> pills was a real blessing.<br><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/stephen_seagull.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_SS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Moustache</strong> - There's something about <strong>Stephen</strong> that just makes my female characters not quite able to get close to him, although all of my male characters end up fast friends with him! Damn am I glad that <strong>Eleesha</strong> didn't decide to kill you like she confessed she wanted to later in the game, getting an active <em>creative/shooter/pilot</em> meant we were always able to defend ourselves, thank you for your dedication!<br><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/jiang_hua.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JH:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Potato</strong> - Despite you starting off not wanting to play the ship I'm thankful that you decided to stay with us in the end, you were still active enough to make a fine partnership with <strong>Moustache</strong> and we wouldn't have made it to <em>Eden</em> without you.<br><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/frieda_bergmann.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_FB:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Best Astronav Ever</strong> - Seriously, pretty much every planet you touched turned to gold, of the 4 crystalite planets you found 3 of them had both oxygen and HC on them (One had 2 HC!), the 4th <em>only</em> had oxygen, and <em>none</em> of them had high danger zones on them. Wow! You're another one I'm glad people didn't kill when the paranoia was at it's height. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"><br><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/gioele_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_GR:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Captain</strong> - An active <em>commander</em> after the removal of inactive <strong>JS</strong> and eventually a coffee powered <em>tech</em> to boot. Solid and reliable, and I'd happily fly with you again! I particularly liked your comment after I decided to add you to the "trusted" channel - <span class="tid_sideNote">"Yes, I am indeed human! 110% human! So human infact you could make a new humanity out of me!"</span> <span class="tid_wspoil">No one did...</span><br><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/eleesha_williams.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_EW:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Eleesha</strong> - I don't think you were ever particularly fond of me, and I'm sorry that you might have felt this way. I distanced myself from you early on after a number of incidents of you being in places I didn't expect you meant that I didn't trust you at all, and I thought you were the archenemy to fear. Visiting <strong>Derek</strong> twice in a turret after selection whilst dirty (Camera I guess), getting "caught" in the <em>FC</em> while I was guarding it during an expo, and generally being the target of <em>premonition</em> for a week made me a little cold, but I was VERY relieved when you became the first confirmed human and as <em>IT/Tech</em> you were invaluable to our success!<br><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/terrence_archer.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_TA:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Mr. Wing Hat Sir</strong> - (Was a <strong>Derek</strong> quote I liked very much!) Our somewhat quiet <em>tech / roboticist</em> you were a cheerful chappy to have onboard and gave me a giggle or 2 throughout the journey! A reliable fixer-upper, despite your lack of materials to work with, you ended up as a largely devoted dismantler of <em>stuff™</em>.<br><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/ian_soulton.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_IS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Ian</strong> - First rate gardener (until I spread your plants across the ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> ), and producer of retro fungal serums and research. Thank you for your service to the mission and for being able to tap into the game despite travelling when we needed you to rush the serum. A couple of gentle nights spent together helped keep spirits high but you were always so sleepy that it never got further than that. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"><br><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/paola_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_PR:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Paola</strong> - Our cured alpha. I'm so sorry you ended up as a solo alpha as bridge staff, you were pretty much screwed after that unless you could have made some all or nothing strike, but you played the long game, and 6 others were gone before you were eventually found out through 10 days of confirmations. Active and dedicated, you were a lovely addition to the crew. I had no reason to suspect you by your actions and honestly think you did the best you could.<br><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/derek.png" alt=":mush_derek_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Turret Monkey</strong> - Honourable mention to our <strong>Derek</strong> who was a VERY dedicated turret defender, spending nearly all his energy on the guns, and when he asked any questions he was genuine and good natured. I did confirm that you had infact tried to repair the turret when you got dirty before your death, but with time pressing on you sadly caught <strong>Eleesha</strong>'s attention and your death had been discussed as an option previously. If we'd managed to confirm you somehow I'd have loved to have you with us.<br><br>The rest of the crew were either inactive, or dead very quickly, although I will mention <strong>Roland</strong> who scared the crap out of me when I thought he'd suicided with the <em>Icarus</em> but I was very glad that you only took your foolish mission in a patroller.<br><br>Thank you all for the ride! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p>

On the lush lands of New Eden her anxiety vanished and her constant panic attacks left her, but there were still humans who needed counseling! And so Janice continued to provide a constant ear for listening, and had words of advice for anyone who asked as she lived the rest of her days helping others.</cite><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"><cite>It took years, but constant therapy sessions with Janice finally curbed the AI's more psychopathic tendencies. He remained a bit of a prankster, but when the matter was important he would do his best to help the humans. The Daedalus was scrapped for parts, but Neron was integrated into their settlement's framework, where he spent the rest of his digital existence keeping a watchful eye over humanity.</cite></p><p>It was a blast you guys, I'm quite happy to have reached Eden for the first time.</p><p>I'm glad you enjoyed my Neron, he's my favorite part of playing Janice. It's great to hear that you're in TiaC Enigma, I'm a new member myself and hopefully we'll launch together again!</p><p>We really were guided by a good deal of luck, if we hadn't had the morale pills I almost certainly would have died from depression.</p>
