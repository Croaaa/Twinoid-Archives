                <p>A dead man is speaking, Jin Su here! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/jinsu.png" alt=":mush_jin_su_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Oh no!!! <br>When I log in I find myself dead.<br>I got a room shake, the cycle afterwards my illness let me bash against the wall, I got a steel plate (was dead already) and when I woudl have survived it, I woudl have sufffered from another room shake too. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But I am glad, my crew made it back. Humanity won in the end, my team won and that is the main point.</p><p>Here's the ship:</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7854" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7854</a></p><p>First thanks to my crew, it was nice how you all worked hard and cooperated very well until the end. We had the goal to reach day 10. And we did it!<br>Well, I died in the process, but that showed at least that it was time to head home, hm? ^^</p><p>All the people:</p><p><strong>Terrence:</strong> Oh, what a great newbie! Terrence was rather new to the game, but I am so glad that he participated that well into the game, he had many ideas, was very active and enjoyable. Also you managed to develop both drones to turbo and firefighter, that's nice! I guess you learned very much on this voyage and I liked that you were that willing to learn stuff.</p><p><strong>Raluca:</strong> Nice job, I am glad you survived Gioele's dumb attack and helped us that well. Pilgred was done very quickly thx to you reading the tech book. Though that was a risk too and if Paola would have transferred into you when she got turned we would have lost probably.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> Always there when needed and the only full -time pilot. Also pilot was myself (who had to help also with moral and moving the ship) and Frieda (who often used her aps for scanning)., Impressive was especially when you extinguished 6 fires in one go while only 2 locations were known. I fed you all days with my missions and they were used well <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Ian:</strong> Our active alpha mush. We thought about you being mush, but when I wanted to kill you with Roland and Frieda we decided otherwise since we had to use Aps elsewehere and we wanted to make sure that there is one active mush. Turning Paola was the right decision when your cover was blown ( Ian did join me in Icarus bay and did "accidentally" found the mycoalarm there, which I hid previously).</p><p><strong>Paola:</strong> Our Betamush. Now you understand probably why I was that careful while interacting with you after noticing that Ian had plenty opportunities to spike you in medlab. I suspected him already at that time. <br>You helped very well in Comms stuff and it would have been nice if we coudl have had you for the end game.<br>It seems that it was good that Frieda and Finola were online at the right time, otherwise you mushes could have won since you wanted to trade pilgred and hack us to Sol. I only heard about it in the Fail thread and I was wondering already why you picked up the soap before Frieda killed you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> (btw Finola, why not just helping to kill Paola instead of killing Eleesha so she could not be traded for pilgred. No Paola no trading <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> )</p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> A very caring person! Often people are not very willing to heal other people but Finola did it well. You are not to blame that the RNG killed me though you healed me already 2 cycles previously, I just had very very bad luck! Also you did your best to not get turned, I guess you played a bit paranoid, but it was effective, normally Finola is the one lieing in medlab the whole time, this time it was Paola, who also got 2 spores here.</p><p><strong>Frieda</strong>: Oh, in teh beginning I was a bit confued about your smilies which did not fit to your message sometimes. But anyway, you played very well, I enjoyed your pilot help in the beginning before scanning. And you are such a lucker <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Frieda found us a planet when we were low on oxygen and one zone was unrevealed. Guess what happened in that unrevealed zone? It turned out to be a shipwreck where Frieda found a starmap fragment. Of course! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Gioele:</strong> You seemed actually a bit suspicious to me, especially that you suspected Raluca without solid evidence. And when you just attacked her without communicating with anyone, trying to kill our only technician, our only hope for a win, I killed you. I would do it again. I hope you learned your lesson, plz speak about such things first and think before acting.</p><p><strong>Janice:</strong> The living bot. She didn't comunicate, she did random stuff, stayed most of the time in refectory and stealed the apron, you could have stayed home. Good that Finola spanked your ass before returning to Sol.</p><p><strong>Hua, Chun, Kuan Ti, Eleesha, Stephen, Chao</strong>: Inactive and starved to death in exception of Eleesha who was mush and got killed.</p><br><br><p>Fun fact:</p><p>This ship did surprise me very well. First goal was just to finish pilgred which seemed to be difficult on its own since we found in the beginning no time where Raluca and someone else were online.<br>Then pilgred was finished, so we wanted to reach day 10, but we had too less oxygen.<br>Our oxygen was that low that I thought: "If I don't find 3 oxygen in these space capsules, it is impossible and pointless and I will return us." First capsules opened: Oxygen! second: Oxygen! Third: Oxygen! Hahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>And so we went on, oxygenated ducts was finished soon afterwards and Frieda also found an oxygen planet so our oxygen situation was rather well.<br>Our biggest problem was lack of pilots then since I had to use many aps for giving speeches (Janice was goofing in refectory) or moving the ship and Frieda searched for planets. Also we had of course at one point 12 hunters, moved-14 hunters-moved-14 hunters... -.-</p><p>So many days the ship was rather quiet regarding room shakes and steel plates because of inactive people...I didn't see it coming that the ship would kill me (especially since Finola healed me from a previous room shake) before my crew returned to Sol <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>I just hope many people of this ship will show up <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

First, I did not know that Frieda was also online - and they were in the middle of the attempt. I had no time to waste. Second, Eleesha was highly inactive (and she was right there in medbay with me.) so I had a 90% hit chance. I could certainly kill her with the limited AP I had, but very likely could not have done more than roughed up Paola a little. The dastardly mush plot would have gone forward. Therefore, I chose the path that would for sure prevent the mush plan.</p><p>Sorry I couldn't save you, Jin Su. As you noted, I'd just healed to you and the ship just had it in for you.</p><p>I made sure to kill Janice because evil play like that where you purposely do <em>not</em> help your team and even refuse to let your passive skill help the crew does <em>not</em> deserve to be part of the win.</p><p>Props to Terrence as well for his excellent help as a newbie. At least you had it better than I did. My first (real) game was as a mush and thank goodness I had a kind and experienced alpha partner (Thanks again <span class="tid_user tid_user_1820888 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1820888">TradeFederation</span> if you read this!) I hope to see more of you around!</p><p>Sorry we lost you to the Mush, Paola. We really wanted to cure you, but your plot left us no time (so good mush move on your part. Only luck (in the form of Me and Frieda coming online just then) kept you from winning.</p><p>Ralucca: Sorry we butted heads at first. I couldn't (and still don't) understand why a human ralucca wouldn't share PILGRED status. Glad you turned out to be human and we got along after that. Trust is so hard with a braindead Chun.</p><p>Roland: Awesome job firefighting and piloting. Sorry you had to carry so much of that burden.</p><p>Ian: Even though you were the enemy, nice plan to win, (not) sorry we had to ruin it. I appreciate the nice attempt though.</p><p>Sorry I don't have time to mention everyone. Great ship, good fun. 10/10 would voyage in a decrepit deathtrap again with all of you (except Janice.) Kuan-Ti, people like her are why you should have made airlocks on the Daedalus.</p>
