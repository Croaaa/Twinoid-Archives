                <p>You can find the game here: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/10778" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/10778</a><br>I know it's not a perfect english but I hope it will be clear enough for you to read.</p><br><br><p>This is a late story now, cold as the ashes on my body’s space grave I guess. I died on that ship but hey, did you know that we mushes, we never die.<br>I woke up as a perfect human without any conscience of being myself. The body was moving by itself, thinking it was a real human like all the others. Until BOOM! One damn neuron which died during the woke-up process has been properly replaced by one of its neighbour, creating a new way of communication and allowing the transformation process to take place.<br>And here I am, fully awake, and taking the lead of <strong>Janice’s body</strong>, a female listener. Damn, that’s not my preferred choice cause intellectual are less easy to fight. I can feel its influence already, all the information I’m taking from it suggested me that is was a perfect opportunity to *manipulate or convert*.<br>That’s was the plan A, but if you have a plan A, you obviously need to have a plan B, that’s the rule. Grenade? Check. Plan of the Grenade? Check. Knife? Check. Blaster 1? Check. Blaster 2? Check. I’m ready for a full rampage plan B. Indeed.<br>Now time for the plan A :<br>Andie, Derek, Raluca and Kuan Ti have a starting spore. I can feel it even if I knew too late for Kuan Ti. My brother <strong>Hua</strong> seems to be asleep right now, I will need to plan action with it later.</p><p>I know for a fact it’s a bad idea to directly go to BDorm, but I’m a lucky mush. The shower is still up alpha dorm. I mutate to prevent my body to take any injury because that was the first thing they were going to check, that’s why Janice’s experience is telling me. One bed was free for a full day, so I waited a little like a nice Janice before taking it and letting my body to a rest.</p><br><p>Next time I had the opportunity to speak with my brother. I think something is awfully wrong with it. It seems slow, not really responsive and most of show no real desire to do anything than pretend. I’m sure it’s the cryo, but I hope that in a few cycle it will be fixed as it was for me.<br>A new day passes and I try as much as possible to use Janice’s experience to hide my actions. I’m working hard nexus, while no biology expert is present on the lab. That’s my luck again even though a camera is there… until an expedition takes place. Gioele removes the camera Nexus. Raluca is there. She has now 2 spores. I press my brother to act, but no response. Gioele takes on of my traps. I think I didn’t mention it to you before, did I? I put some traps to infect people, and infect they did.<br>Gioele was the first one, Roland was one too even if I was hoping for something else. Stephen took one too but that’s another story.<br>Gioele and Stephen went to the planet to explore and came back very badly hurt. I knew for a fact that Gioele was around midlife and Stephen was 2/3. That was my first opportunity to go for plan B… But I decide to stick with plan A. I manage to get Chun to give me the medikit and heal as a good human Gioele twice and Stephen once. I try to build some trust here.</p><p>n the meantime, humans decide to kill a sleepy Jin Su. One human less. Less than a day after if I remember correctly, Terrence dies of hunger. That’s pretty good… Until I hear about Andie who woke up… and she took Polyvalent…. Damn. I was using every bit of time to extract and infect alone as I can.</p>

                <p>Andie wasn’t really active but his bonus in research was really not welcome for me…. Until the humans decide to kill him shortly after. They killed HIM. WHAT A LUCK! It’s so convenient that I can feel something in the body react to it. I think the heart was pumping faster. I was going to say good job guys but fortunately for me, Janice’s part was kind of shocked… and so was I now. I have to pretend to be a human, remember?<br>I require some explanation and got none. Gioele took the initiative so I checked for a link but he was human. I checked again but he was still human. Thank you Gioele for this free murder. 3 humans down.</p><p>I’m talking a lot with Chun but I feel something is wrong. Even though I didn’t extract anything day 3 (we started day 2) hoping for the non-responsive Hua to get a chance to extract, I could feel she was into me a little. That was kind of strange so I started to save my energy, and I didn’t had to try hard because I had only few relays. After 3 deads the moral should be low, so I began to complain about them killing this easily people… And Chun asked me for hugs, C7 or C8.<br>That was occasion number 2 to switch to plan B. I had the means to kill some of them. I decided to stick to plan B so I hugged her. Like a good damn human.</p><p>It is now day 4, I didn’t had a bed but I was doing some psychiatry shit Alpha Dorm. When I took control again, the Armor of the vessel was around 34. The ship was going to explode really soon and it wasn’t in my plan. I took a wrench and decide to repair the hull myself because it was critic, like a good human. I was INCREDIBLY LUCKY because I manage to get a +20 with the 4 metallic we got without using a lot of energy. I manage to hurt a little myself during the process. Time to extract as much as I can before taking a shower, let’s switch to Bdorm.<br>My mutation protects me from taking any damages but Chun is really upset to see I’m hurt. I tell her why but she found it odd. I ask my human part and it doesn’t see the point neither. She heals me to check if it’s a big wound or a small and discover it’s a small. I can still feel her eyes on me more than it should, something is going really wrong here.</p><p>I had to leave the bdorm soon than I would like, I guess it was to activate the shield. We were going to move soon so I hoped the shield wasn’t going to regenerate too much. The big moral signal booster was going to come the next day, so I had no reason to go back to a dorm. It was time for me to press my human mascaraed and help the research time because they were really late. I went there, got my mushy cat (little thing is nasty and put a spore on Stephen. Good cat.) And worked on constipatore to finish it. I had no more hope on Hua and didn’t talk to her anymore.</p><p>Chun eyes where even more on me, so while it was time to be hungry, I gave her back a blaster to let go of some steam. I knew it wasn’t working because she started to bust about “The mush are the one more human than the human”. I was pressing her to kill Gioele but she was utterly confident he was human without telling me why. He was on no list and his action helped me more than anything. He was a good mush… I mean human for a mush… I mean a human. He was a good mush as a human. Damn. You know what I’m trying to say, are you not?</p>

                <p>They didn’t had a lot of proven human, one of them was Derek. The other one was Stephen I think, I can’t recall. Why was she so sure I was mush and Gioele was human? That didn’t make any sense. She had little suspicion on other humans, I could feel it. First Paola, then it was Ian because he was shielding me, as all Ian does if they stay on the lab. She asks me if I find Paola strange. Of course she was not, she on her time. Did she it? Yes yes she did, I’m pretty sure I saw her. Don’t be afraid she did.</p><p>It’s day 5 or 6, I was working research (still late btw) for a full 8 cycles. It was growing more and more boring and I was going to go for the B plan because the ship was useless… But I felt something in the air. We don’t modify the host body this mush but something was going on, they start to organize themselves. Was I the subject? It seemed so. Wow. Just Wow.<br>Less than 1 cycle later, Derek started to punch me. He was working on the research not long before so he almost took me by surprise. One, 2, 3. I’m not in a good shape. That’s pretty bad, time to move while he is punching. I can’t use the grenade right now.<br>I run as fast as I can to the dorms, and the nexus, I transform Raluca who should be at least mid-energy, read who is the strongest between Kuan Ti, Roland, and Stephen… And chose Stephen. Good pick, he is full life and full energy. I was going to steal Derek’s for the fun but we don’t have fun. I gave Derek his second spore to help <strong>Raluca</strong> convert a proven human, or Hua…<br>I took the knife, killed my old body to remove them from any source of moral, run to the deck and read the new found biologist book to prevent them from having the RFS and save any of the other mushes, or Sol.</p><p>I then busted as much as I could, given them false information as candies. They started to suspect Ian, so he put directly 3 bananas on his system. A shame it was on the good side, really. I gave everything as fast as I could to Raluca and Hua (informations) to help them win.</p><p>Stephen was solid so they lost their energy into me. It was part of my plan too, to give some edge to Hua and Raluca. Eleesha event tried to shoot at me. Funny, I took her pistol. It took them almost a full cycle to kill me.</p><p>They failed. Hua died like she lived. Raluca who I studied the most didn’t move neither. Slaughterhouse welcome.</p><p>Only Roland was left as a pilot. They rush the pilgred and came back. It’s just a matter of time before they will become part of us. They can’t stop us, they can’t “heal” us. Tomorrow is another day, and they will find other mushes back to Sol. I guess they are all dead now.</p>

                <p>Hi, mushy Janice!<br>It's me, Gioele. Your best friend among humans <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>That was a damn good detective flight. Mushhunter' mind have been blown away few times and now I am really surprised that you've done all this alone. I've missed all the action about killing you, but I was nominated by Chun, and Eleesha to understand what exactly happened and Derek was required to be reconfirmed as human or mush.</p><p>Even earlier we were suspecting Hua a lot, and we were getting very sure when she didn't eat. Besides, Chun was almost sure, that you are mushy, Janice. I wasn't so sure in this, by the way.</p><p>So, we've had a lot of different versions, and our first solution was to kill everyone in BD, cause we were sure Hua was a mush. But she did not get up while camera was away... anyway we killed her. So, who is the third one? And how many mushes are under anonymush? Looks like pilot were a target, then we need to kill Roland. But wait, why she removed camera in Nexus and didn't even turn off the shield? Okay, let's kill Raluka and check the list. Okay, we're lucky!</p><p>Indeed they are lucky, I still have enough AP to kill 5 people at once <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"><br>While waiting, I was almost ready to kill Eleesha and Derek.</p>

                <p>Derek here. I still wonder how you managed to notice me punching you. I was staying in lab for a long time, 40 minutes or so, and then began to kick you really fast. Only 5, at most 10 seconds passed between the first kick and your run to dorms.</p><p>We suspected very seriously that in a mushhunt group there was a traitor that warned you, so you've prepared for the plan. There were five of us in it: Chun, Ian, Gioele, Eleesha, and I [Derek]. Gioele and Eleesha weren't proven humans, so they were at the brink of death. Luckily they both were proved very soon.<br><br>It was really surprising to see that you did everything alone, as Gioele said before.</p>

                <p>NotJust :<br>A good plan never holds. You have to make last minute arrangement... but it's easy when you are full life to think of it, a lot less easy when you have 5 life left.<br>My contingency plan was to remove all the cameras to prevent you from understanding who was the new mush between 7 people and remove the shield. I was too much on a hurry because everyone was online and forgot about it. I missed the opportunity with the AD because I was still carrying the "Grenade plan" with me (full inventory). I didn't read the message and was in a hurry. + Chun was the only one in AD and Derek just came... Infect Derek was almost fun to let everyone think he was the 3rd but it was already too late cause even Frieda, who wasn't even in the hunt saw the fight + the new mush + Chun + Derek and they were already talking about it.</p><p>I still don't understand why Gioele was so trustworthy. I was expecting his death more than anything but it never came.<br>With more relays than most I was pretty sure you were going to kill the other mush if possible to try to give me the serum (Genious Raluca). I didn't understood your choice to kill me. I don't find the logic neither.<br>Good job netherless.</p><p>Hua did ate (Chun bring her a coffee a day before) but I heard she was kileld because she wasn't willing to eat 2 days after in order to remove a fire. That's what killed her. This one I understand.<br>Raluca I understand too, she was such an easy prey to convert and because of the shield was a little too obvious I guess, good job.</p><p>Innokentiy:<br>I knew something was taking place but I wasn't sure exactly why. "Are they going to attack me? Naaaaaa... They have nothing against me, they won't... No no, they are planning to kill me but how? I didn't made a lot of mistakes, just some but too thin to remove their only psy. The starter mage book wasn't the psy (guess) and Paola's wasn't really interesting. Why remove me from the equation now?".<br>The intuition used against me helped me on this, because I remember cleary reading something on internet and I stopped suddenly and thought "CHECK MUSH". There is was. I was lucky <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br>I don't know if you could say "a lot", but I tried to convert the ship, I find it much more stressful and entertaining.</p><p>Venom :<br>When you are not a proven human most of the people feel that. As a pilot, check what the others are doing is interesting but as you can see, Hua was playing human. Not easy to detect she was a mush.... So you take your job seriously and try to survive. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
