                <p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7968" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7968</a></p><p>Hey there, Alpha Frieda here <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This is my second time being Alpha. I even made a screenshot of this <em>epic</em> moment <a href="http://i.imgur.com/iSsE8UO.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/iSsE8UO.png</a></p><p>My Alpha partners were:</p><ul><li><span class="tid_strike">Jin Su, lvl 14 gold mush </span></li><li>Eleesha, lvl 10 silver mush</li><li>Ian, lvl 14 silver mush</li><li>Raluca, lvl 11 silver mush</li></ul><p>And I was lvl 16 gold as always</p><p>When I became mush, I was shocked that <em>all</em> my partners were suspicious as hell, and Chao even tortured them several times. Good thing that I was a "confirmed" human in the "mush hunt channel" so I knew exactly what was happening. I never went to Bravo Dorm, and I was never dirty. I was planning to ask my partners to do the dirty job from the very beginning.</p><p>How did I become a confirmed human? Apparently they counted my AP when I was shooting hunters from a patroller ( I nommed a ration in space). I also ate some fruits in the Lab right before I became Mush. I learned later that those fruits would have given me <strong>Extreme tinnitis</strong>, but I became mush before that kicked in. In hindsight, if the humans had paid any attention they would have noticed that I don't have illness, which is a serious evidence of mushiness.</p><br><p>Chun wanted to kill Eleesha, so the first plan that I proposed was uncovering all the blasters and dismantleing them to stop the humans from rushing the natamy rifle. Unfortunately, when I came back online after sleeping IRL nobody did what I said, they researched the natamy rifle and Chun started safekeeping it.</p><p>So I decided that we need to act before it's too late. I asked who was online, Ian was the only one who replied. The plan was:</p><ul><li>Transfer into Finola (I was the one who told her to safekeep the disk)</li><li>Read the technician book in BD, dismantle the Mush Disk and the shower ( Kuan Ti was safekeeping the book all the time, but he decided to drop it for some weird reasons)</li><li>Hide the apron</li></ul><p>Of course she was supposed to die in the end, but that sacrifice was totally worth it, wasn't it? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/sifflote.gif" alt=":-&quot;" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I knew that without the disk, pheromodem and dead Eleesha they will be unable to check if they are mush free or not, so that was very important.</p><p>That's why I created a few plans and proposed them to my mush comrades:</p><ul><li>Good old Pilgred rush. Eleesha and Raluca rush Pilgred, I wait until they reach 50%, transfer into Chao and push the button</li><li>Oxygen extraction. Extract 18 oxygen capsules, break the tanks, declare 2 ceasefires in BB and AB and guard them</li></ul><p>They said that both are good, we discussed it a bit and agreed that we should rush Pilgred. Oxygen extraction would have been to painful to behold. I sent 7 gold days to Raluca to pick Fertile and Phagocyte to be 100% sure that they can finish it, and they decided to start it on day change. Raluca extracted her free spore right before the day change and went to the Engine Room.</p><p>It was looking pretty good even though A LOT of people were active, they advanced it to 60% so I picked Transfer, Fertile and Phagocyte and started moving to Chao so I can transfer and push the button. I was ready to extract my free spore and kick out whoever is guarding FC even if Chao is out of AP. But the most unexpected event happened:<br><strong>Chun one shot killed Raluca in the middle of pilgred rush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></strong></p><p>So I stopped moving there, came back to FC and pushed the "Guard" button to pretend that I'm actually helping humans. They bought it without problems</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Chun</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Great reaction as for Granny ^^ Maybe I should reconsider forming Elite Chun's Guardians Batalion made up from only 1000+ years old? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></span></span></p><p>For some weird reasons Chun was talking with Eleesha in the Engine Room, so I decided to take advantage of that and told her to "confess" that we're mush free. Her words really made a big impact on "the mush hunt".</p><p>I was guessing that the secret "confirmed humans" channel existed, in order to win their trust I decided to try my luck and bought the Survival Kit from my vending machine. Some people argued that mush can buy it, but I guess the info in the Q&amp;A thread totally confused them and they invited me in there and called me "confirmed " as well.</p><p><strong>God, that Survival kit was the best 4 klix that I ever invested <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></strong></p><p>Not only it "confirmed" my "humanity", but also Paola got curious and opened it, and <em>got dirty</em> in the process and became top suspect in an instant. That was so suspicious that Chao came to her, hit her multiple times and tortured.</p><p>And even after that they were <em>still</em> suspecting her. Chun almost killed her with the natamy rifle. They shot her x3, punched x2 and Gioele also punched her once. How she survived all that is beyond me...</p><p>I was feeling pretty comfortable being a "confirmed human". Honestly, I was hoping to infiltrate Eden, but their luck was so bad that I decided to abandon that idea. 4 cristalite planets, a ton of intelligent life + other artefact zones didn't give any starmaps at all. Not a single one. I knew that I can't afford to wait until D20 for them to reach Eden. I was waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike.</p><p>One time I spotted that Chun hid the hacker kit and the knife in some storages <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BVHYt1x.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/BVHYt1x.png</a></p><p>I was making some great plans about them, but unfortunately Ian noticed and adviced Chun that she should re-hide them <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>They were still paranoid that there might be mushes onboard, they were going to confirm everyone by giving them spoiled fruits and such. And they wanted to rush the Mushovore Bacteria which would have destroyed my emergency plans.</p><p>On the very last expedition they visited yet another Mush Trap, a bunch of people got spored and I realized that this is the perfect opportunity that I was waiting for. I went ahead and executed my plan.</p><p>The plan was to transfer into Terrence who said that he was going to be AFK for a long time, therefore he must have had full AP bar. <br>I transfered into him, converted Janice and we went and finished Pilgred. Then we tried to hack the command terminal but failed our first time. She declared a ceasefire on the Bridge, we waited there and succeeded next cycle.</p><p>The End. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/W5CngaA.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/W5CngaA.png</a></p><p>I hope to hear your perspectives of the story. That was a really exciting and FUN game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hey, Aerial. Not on this ship, but I was asking Europa how she is when I tried to brag about my awesome human team when I was Mush, and how I tricked them.</p><p>She told me she just joined MS and first game was very frustrating. She played as Chun, it was day 5 when she suffered PILGRED rush which turned up to very high %, and about Ian transferring into Finola to get Mush Disk and dismantling it (I know how easy to dismantle Mush Disk). She told that the ship was real battlefield, she couldn't trust anyone and there was no way she would drop the Natamy Rigle even for a second. Did you really want her to make her heart attack or what? On her first ship as CHUN?</p>

                <p>Roland checking in. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>My hat goes off to the mush on this one and you guys deserve the win. While we had a good and active human crew, there was some information that was to closed hold. I wasn't a big fan how we kept confirmed humans so quiet to the masses. If that info was public, I think we could have made things a bit more difficult for you. Since I was operating outside of the human only channel, I was pretty much forced to only focus on flying. I love the mush hunt, but felt I was side lined. Oh well, thats just how some games go I suppose.</p><p>Still, it was a great time. First time with the sleeping shrooms and I thought it was awesome.</p>

She played as Chun, it was day 5 when she suffered PILGRED rush which turned up to very high %, and about Ian transferring into Finola to get Mush Disk and dismantling it (I know how easy to dismantle Mush Disk).

My story goes as:</p><p>I woke up as alpha as the second one on day 2, Eleesha was already a mush. As i was really unlucky with dismantling shower, i knew i will be suspect after dumping so many APs, even tho i was still human at that time. Along with fast researches from Finola, I and Eleesha (who was suspicious too) decided that we will lay low untill more mush are awake, so we can use the potencial of <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_progressive.png" alt=":mush_mush_progressive_1:" class="tid_ico">+<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/three_mush.png" alt=":mush_three_mush_1:" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>As third, Ian woke up. with this, we agreed that we will keep waiting for opportunity and will try to play it for asphyxia, if we will have chance and O2 will drop a bit more. We were thinking that Ian will just let his trees in inventory die.</p><p>As fourth, Frieda (Aerial) was awaken and things started to get in motion. Aerial suggested that we should dismantle disk, cause without Eleesha on human side, they can never know if they are mush free. This was well executed and we gained this advantage (although i dont know if it wasnt better to use tech book to rush pilgred easier and finish right there..).</p><p>As stated in Aerials' review, then we decided to go with pilgred rush and the time was set for daychange (with phatocyte+fertile and pilgred point reset on daychange). We did the math and knew that it will be almost for sure that we will finish it with my 2-3 attemps per 1 Eleesha relay. Frieda should transfer to Chao and take us to Sol after we finish it. Plan was set and ready to go. It was a good plan..</p><p>..then a lot of activity were going on, lot of people were online, but we decided anyway to risk it and rush it, as weekend was starting, and me and Eleesha wasnt able to agree on next time we both will be online to execute it. Also, i was about to be full on AP after daychange and keeping my bar full would be suspicious, so we gave it a go..</p><p>..and then, problems came up. I remembered that the game had almost no lag the night before (it was 11am for me when the plan was in motion), but when i started moving from FBT to engine room, every room change took about 30 seconds, so i didnt make it to engine room to spend my pilgred point before daychange. But we had lot of reserve % to finish <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_pilgred.png" alt=":mush_pa_pilgred:" class="tid_ico">, so i was still very confident that we will make, but then i saw Eleeshas message(while writting her when she has to relay) that Chun is in motion. Along with the fact that i hurt myself three(!) times while progressing pilgred, i knew that time is of the essence more that ever.. last thing i saw is that chun is in the room, she hit me for 7 HP and pilgred is 82% after reset from Eleesha. After i clicked the button, i saw im dead, so it didnt progress..</p><p>As aftermath, i saw that Chun had APs for just 2 shots and it took maybe 3-4 minutes before another member showed up and started punching Eleesha. While i was just too clicks away to fnish pilgred and i had enough APs to finish it without relays from 82%.</p><p>So here is conclusion: i had 16HP(thanks to gold from Aerial), while Chun had only 2 shots from natamy, with first hitting for 7HP. If i didnt hurt myself three times in the process, i could have 50% chance of surviving the other shot and finishing pilgred.. So you human were quite lucky, but also Chun did really good job!</p><p>Thats the end of my story. The rest was aranged by Aerial and was executed really good. Thanks to him for our victory <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Its not totally foolproof, a clever Chao might work out that you are searching to block his torturer. Especially if you've searched more rooms than you've entered. Doing no mushy actions at all is a much better way to beat torturer. If he has to do 3-4 punches, plus healing you afterwards, you can waste a lot of his AP just by walking through bravo dorm.</p>

                <p>Aerial, you forgot my favorite part. After (mush) Ian became Finola for the disk, (new mush) Finola had to go to BD for the book. I'm assuming you were trying to hide that the disk was dismantled so you also defaced the room. The only people in there were Chun, Kuan Ti and Janice</p><p>Kuan Ti and Janice got up and moved right away so everyone made a case of Finola + one of them being Alpha, while the other was a Beta. Why else would mush deface a dorm? It didn't help that Kuan Ti dropped all his safekept stuff to follow Finola, which ended in Finola picking up the stuff he was keeping. It looked like coordination. It also didn't help that Kuan Ti was supposed to be the one safekeeping the book Finola used to dismantle the dis</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Well, if we ignore the very strange circumstances of my death, it was a very fun game.<br>Since no one except me and Chun knows the whole roleplay deal, let’s just skip the speculation. Hopefully it didn’t ruin your experience (and my sincere apologies if it did).</p><p>YOU SHALL NOT PASS! – screamed Aerial and started to guard the Bridge, when Pilgred rush failed. Two mushes were slaughtered in 5 minutes. Two were already dead. They thought they were safe…</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> I was Kuan Ti</p><p>I remember we started slow. My investigation into Janice brought no fruit, she just liked bravo dorm and that’s it. She also regularly picked up medkit and went ahead to check on crew, or researching the pomade. The bottom line – medkit was always out of place, and many crew were injured anyway.</p><p>Stephen was a rushy type, quick to judge, but fair mostly, did some strange paper spams and alarm hiding in Icarus, but was overwhelmingly active and helpful at all times. Chum ‘been a teamplayer. Was thinking to give him gold later on…</p><p>Terry and Roland were busy irl, Raluca stayed in the Front Turret (?), poor Paola couldn’t work because something always happened (Apron gone, comms broke, Aerial’s survival kit dirtbomb exploded into her face), and Gioele was solid caffeine junkie, pushing crew human relativist. Eleesha was there for the taking <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico">.

I saw defacer on my mobile screen while sitting in a traffic jam. Me and Jancie wiggled a bit, trying to figure out what was going on. Last around the dorm was Finola (obviously mush), and I thought we had a rampage. She took a few punches from me, then, knowing I couldn’t finish her off, expecting to have a few spores in me, I decided to take shelter with Ian in the Lab. Ian initiated the conversation. He was skilless Finola in the body of a botanist, no i-trackie on him. So I plugged him in through my link with the rest of the crew. Frieda died shortly. Unfortunately she was able to dismantle the disk by reading a book I dropped in BD to take Medic and Astro from the Bridge. I reported it in one of the threads. Looks like my reporting of it was ignored as no one took Tec book to secure instead. I should definitely been more meticulous about this <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>Many crew were confirmed humans by then. Me and Hua were probably the ones crew would suspect the most. Our main exploration pilot had some trouble launching our expos, so I was suspicious from the start. But after we spent a lot of time in pm, she attended every expo and my suspicion evaporated. It was obvious she was just a bit confused on the correct course of action with all the messages around. In the end Hua did well.</p><p>In the middle of the night we had a pilgred rush. Me and Chun were online and she did a great reaction once she saw Eleesha flanking to the Engine Room: rushed there and put a bullet in Raluca. I received a message from Chun, and soon poor Elee was done.</p><p>YOU SHALL NOT PASS! – screamed Frieda and started to guard the Bridge, when Pilgred rush failed. Two mushes were slaughtered in 5 minutes.</p><p>Poor Chun. She was almost the single sole protector of the ship this game. I’m sure everyone tried to do their best but with Chao burdened with commander role and Eleesha mush, Chun was alone, paranoid and stressed. Confirmed Ian tried to help her as he could, but what could he see while staying in the front? Although constantly doubting everyone, Chun did a very good job. Big hug to her.</p><p>Aerial steamrolled everyone again. He couldn’t, of course, done it without the help of the entire mush team. Good job guys!</p>

I tried to do what I could but... my apologies. in the end I was unable to do much at all. the mushes played really good. I was already dissappointed with being Terrence though cause... I HATE playing him. I think I tried once and I hate him so much -.-... SIGH. I'd rather be someone else. but not Eleesha or Chun cause I just didn't have enough time for those characters. Chun... wow, you were almost ALWAYS online and did a really good job. thank you everyone for the ship. I still had a lot of fun.</p>

Ok - AP was started not by me so I will not put MY AP standards here. Insted I will try to fit in. Which means... You will not see 3 or 4 messages filled with wall of text made by me this time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Insted there will be really short one.</p><p>First of all - congratulation to <span class="tid_user tid_user_8092972 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8092972">Aerial</span> and rest of his Mush Team on pulling off such win. That was really interesting way to play as Mush (to get hidden untill D10 and fool people that one is comfirmed humman WITH the help of Q&amp;A!!! - remember this lesson everybody - Question And Answers is a LIE! Just like a cake ^^).</p><p>Secondly... I said that once during ship, but I will say it here once more. I am sorry for that incident with TuttiKuanTi (<span class="tid_user tid_user_8436632 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8436632">technolass</span>). It was stupid. It was childlish of me. It was totally not necessary. And it was wrong of me. So I am sorry.</p><p>Thirdly - I am sorry that I am putting my input only NOW, but that is because I was at work, and reading all messages also took a lot of time. So... Here I am finnaly.</p><p>Problem is of course that NOW there is not much to add into story. Of course, I could write few tomes of story that was going on this ship, about my thoughts that were going through my head [everybody who ever read single one of my APs (and there were whole 2 in total AFAIK, will know that this is what I usually do describe], but I don't see any point of it really. Insted I will comfirm that I had fun from begining to very end of ship. I didn't liked role which i had to do - to play as Chun when I really hoped to play as Mush is just disapointment - but I did tried to do my best. And... I tried my best to RP my little Chun in rather crazy way. That lasted untill... Let's just leave it behind - it ended at some point. Case closed! Move along! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I hope that You enjoyed what I showed You... I can assure that I did many diffrent RPing styles with diffrent characters and once I had even pleassure to RP Ian as a singer that was creating poetry <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">And had Chao in duet <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I do hope to show more on next ships... OMG! Why am I talking about THIS even? I should have concentrated on story from my point of view!!! GOD DAMNIT! Not again! I will end up propably spamming long text of wall! SORRY! That is part of being me. And I am very good at being myself, so nobody else has to be... And that meanst it will be as it needs to be done. Ok... Ok... Let's go on, shall we?</p><p><strong>WORST PROBLEM I HAD TO FACE</strong><br>With Mush waking up on every possible cycle untill D5 has ended I litelary could not form any and all gropus. Sure - there were formed groups here and there... They consisted from 2 up to 5 diffrent characters (including me). But I had to leave them behind every now and than JUST because they had random chance to "wake up as Mush". If any of them would get infected, it could be found out in logs... Or defacer could be noticed if somebody is observant eoungh. But sleeper Mush? Nope! No warning. POOOF! One cycle humman - another cycle Mush. And no mention about it in logs - no mistake made, no one spiking or crossing same corridor in same time... Conversion without any proof of happening <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> That litelary rendered every and all comfirmed hummans to be unimportant untill D6C1 (or D5C1 - but I choose to not risk). And YES! If somebody was comfirmed humman at D5C6 or 7 - I still didn't risked bringing Him in. Only exeption to this rule was <em>Ian</em> (Finomino Bambino before Transfer) who was played by <span class="tid_user tid_user_8073024 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8073024">Tpyo</span> ^^ You have no idea HOW glad I was to have You on board with me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> It is ALWAYS a pleassure to see You <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> It is funny since I do show emotions all over the place on my ships. You? None of that! Hahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Ok. I stop now, since I don't want somebody to call me drunken &gt;.&lt; Point is - sleeper mode for Mushes not only means I have no idea how many of them I will have in the end, but I also could not really trust anybody till D6C1.</p><p><strong>MY PARANOIA</strong><br>Yhh... I was pretty paranoid. I was seeing Mushes in everybody around and I always was affraid that they managed to infect somebody from my close comfirmed hummans team. In the end - this time I was kind of right... Kind of. Since there was no conversion (I am NOT counting Jannice at very end). Insted I made one, single mistake of believing in what I read in Q&amp;A. This mistake let me to overlook MANY things Frieda did. Yes... Great many! That was an exellent move Frieda! And also worthy lesson for me in future <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> But... I AM AGAIN TALKING NOT ABOUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT!!! So... I constantly had doupts in my own judgment, in other players, in their motives... I felt cornered and I didn't really had anybody to trust in 100%. Exacly how Chun should feel. Too bad that I didn't picked Her! I was forced to play as her &gt;.&lt; Seriously - had I any way of choosing my character, I would not picked Chun for sure. Not for my very first ride with MS. For that one must prepare himself. I could not. So no wonder my paranoia was getting better of me at many occasions.</p><p><strong>IN THE END...</strong><br>In the end I woke up today before going to work, logged in and just when I started to think that MAYBE Eleesha was NOT lying, I saw that it is over already. In fact I logged in only for few minutes, only to check if there is anything that should be ugrently done... What I see? Case Fire on Bridge, Janice turned into Mush and She is holding HK. I should have to hide it somewhere, but got distracted day before and totally forgot about it. Than gain - it was worth only 5 AP which Mushes had anyway so I don't think it really changed that much. What to do? Only thing left is to congratulate Mush Team their win and go to work, right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong><em>I can only say two things. Firstly - I showed You my best. I could not be better than I was. I hope I managed to turn this time into something interesting and fun for most of You.<br><br>Secondly I must say that people I met on this ship... Not all of them, but some of them, brought possitive impresion of Mush Superiority as Group into my personal opinion. So it changed drastically (in a possitive way).</em></strong></p><p>Thank You! And... See You next time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <em>Europa hugs <span class="tid_user tid_user_8436632 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8436632">technolass</span>... And gives gentle kiss in cheeck to <span class="tid_user tid_user_8073024 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8073024">Tpyo</span>.</em> (who will as always just ignore all emotional layer and will go straight to buissnes... If He will have any buissnes at all <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> )</p><p>PS. Nice to see <span class="tid_user tid_user_1598888 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1598888">PatrykSzczescie</span> that You choose to be gentle, resonable and civil this time ^^ Big thans to You! Train it hard and some day You might stop getting Yourself into troubles. Will hold my thumbs for You <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>PS2. WOW! I just managed to NOT have to create 2 or more messages! Totally unlike usual me ^^</p>

                <p>Well, I was joking with Europa that if she's Chun on MS, she'll simply end up in the Nexus guarded by Chao in Rear Corridor. And no, she wasn't as active as you thought. She's just active around the day change. Once I asled her in early morning, I received an answer in late evening. That I instructed her that she must be active, that mushroom were sulking while she was sleeping, finding the way to make it to Sol. <em>Indeed, I was right.</em></p><p>And I told her that she should've acted like she played with 15 Aerials! <em>and shoot these ones which play worse...</em> There aren't any things he doesn't know. Don't hide important items in storages, <a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/RILe0w/8">never trust your body</a> if you aren't Chun... so give the Mush Disk to Finola for everybody know that it's given, but tell her in PM that she must hide it in central turret and close the PM before Mush transfers into her...</p><p>But OK, I must admit I wouldn't make it better... unless the accident with Hacker Kit in the storage... They'll remember you as the best Chunny the Chun they ever had because who would forget YOU shooting Raluca in her head while she was finishing PILGRED... and poor Eleesha who couldn't do anything just look her last moments.</p><p>And Aerial: how could they notice your lack of AP, didn't you access the AstroTerminal and pretend to scan a new planet in hope for mankarogs or whatever?</p>

After (mush) Ian became Finola for the disk, (new mush) Finola had to go to BD for the book. I'm assuming you were trying to hide that the disk was dismantled so you also defaced the room. The only people in there were Chun, Kuan Ti and Janice</p><p>Kuan Ti and Janice got up and moved right away so everyone made a case of Finola + one of them being Alpha, while the other was a Beta. Why else would mush deface a dorm? It didn't help that Kuan Ti dropped all his safekept stuff to follow Finola, which ended in Finola picking up the stuff he was keeping. It looked like coordination. It also didn't help that Kuan Ti was supposed to be the one safekeeping the book Finola used to dismantle the dis</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p></cite><br><p>Yeah, I didn't trust Kuan in the slightest after that. Who protects a medic book over tech or pilot? It's not like the mush are going to research us to death.</p><p>We had a few other cases of humans doing things that looked mushy. Paola claimed there were mystery pills despite being able to read them and Hua rushed to water the plants in the middle of the day when we had no shower and a missing apron.</p><p>BTW the survival kit didn't actually do anything, you were still the confirmed human that guarded FC, yey sleeping mush!</p>

It's enough that you own Stephen Gioele Chao Ian and all weapon and you're immortal, and some other people to support, infect more people, and contaminate the crew.<br>Try some luck in random ship where you may start one of two Mush, not hidden. Interesting how far you'd go away.</cite><p>In most cases, our castings are harder for the mush. You can't feign being bronze and pretending to be inactive only goes so far (we can see every player who was ready beforehand and all silver / gold players are supporters). You won't have one of our castings missing a camera or getting defaced and not getting noticed. Something as simple as trying to hide the mush sample generally results in an early mush death. The mush can't wait for the ship to explode or run out of oxygen and nearly every ship has an active gold chao with torturer with a full research crew that knocks out 2-4 researches in the first day (if not first cycle if they aren't dealt with).</p><p>On a random ship there might only be 3-4 very active players (including yourself) who could hunt the mush out. If the mush wasn't picked from one of those 3-4 players then you generally have a human victory. When <em>you</em> are picked as mush, now there's only 2-3 players that can root you out and you can make some risky moves in converting the others to essentially own the ship as mush. No such luck on a casting, if you sacrifice yourself converting the most active player then you'll still need to act immediately (as areial did) since you probably can't hide.</p><p>While it was a mush victory, it was still only a pilgred rush. Most of the mush were killed off and we ended with excellent hull + plasma shield, nearly full oxygen, and jumpkins + heat lamps. It had to be Mush+Humans to sol because no other strat would have worked (save maybe for rushing chun down and transfering to chao / ian). Besides, the real victory was how areial convinced us she was human and the social games such as guarding FC when the first rush went sour.</p>
