                <p><strong>(Warning: Not advised for mycophobia-suffering users. I wonder how did they even touch these forums, though... <em>Also ot I have a very light version of mirmecophobia, which means I fear ants, though not non-scary monsters...</em>)</strong><br><span class="tid_strike">______________________________________________________________________</span><br><strong>Sentient Mushes</strong> (latest version here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kypmjgvdctcaxc8/SentientMushesvv13b.pk3?raw=1" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/kypmjgvdctc...</a> ) is a spin-off of this great game (which I never did play, but my friend inspired me with it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> ) which runs on the <strong>ZDoom</strong> ( <a href="http://www.zdoom.org" target="_blank">http://www.zdoom.org</a> ) engine, which is a source port of Doom itself, which if you don't know ( :O ) is a very classic FPS from 1993; source ports are changes in the source code of games that makes them more advanced, etc. ZDoom is a overhaul of Doom sporting more modding capabilities, like over 9000!</p><p>The use of ZDoom and the Doom engine also means this spin-off will be quite capable of maintaining the retro/classic feel of the original "amuscarian game", while adding a flavor of shooter to it.</p><p>You start as the antagonist though... Not sure how many people will this <em>trigger</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Currently, this is an addon for <strong>Chex Quest 3</strong> ( <a href="http://www.moddb.com/games/chex-quest/downloads/chex-quest-3-official-release" target="_blank">http://www.moddb.com/games/chex-quest...</a> ), which is another ZDoom game. That's because the spin-off, before hitting adult age, will yet need something to grow in... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It does also need some light to grow with photossynthesis. Anyone willing to help me with the lanterns?</p><p>The official IRC channel is <em>#sentientmushes</em> at Zandronum IRC (available at Mibbit or via any IRC client at irc.zandronum.com).</p>

                <p>Sorry, in most forums there is a edit button, but I couldn't find it; either way, I wanted to add that the story board is the following:</p><p><em>Sometime, a millenium after in Earth, you were in the middle of execution of your hideous "lightly" plan. However, you receive a call. Some alien race is attacking Earth, just as you though it would be safe to take over those four-limbed pricks! "There are aliens all around attacking us! They name themselves...", a tensious break in the call, "the Branx! We can do anything in exchan- *static*\" You have a new task. Save your race, and then save this race; remember, no corpse infection!<br><br>You try to escape to Radeo in a spaceship, disregarding the call (while killing or infecting all Branx in your way), however the escape is detected and the small escape pod is captured by the Branx sentinels!<br><br>You escape the Branx interrogatory, unlike the rest of the crew, who didn't even see you sneaking aboard, and you got it - this is really wrong! You find a Branx rebellion group and fight along them.<br><br>You find Chickenstein, but there is a giant cybernetic thingie guarding it - the Dominator!<br><br>You defeat the Dominator, but Chickenstein escapes in his way to Tamina.<br><br>In "Chickenstein's Nemesis", you intercept his spaceship, you hideously follow him and destroy it before it even touches Tamina!<br><br></em>(from this point onwards, the storyboard is just a sketch for Sentient Mushes II; we just finished two maps on Sentient Mushes <strong>1</strong>!)<em><br><br>However, Radeo is destroyed right as you kill Chickenstein. It bursts in an explosion. You see a giant crater of lava disappearing with the planet. Some meteor hit it!<br><br>You receive a distress call from Aldebaran. A mysterious one.<br><br>Mid your journey, you find what will soon become your best friend in the story, Drake, a red dragon, very similiar to you, but slightly taller.<br><br>You decide to see what's going up, but it's a trap made by a giant cybernetic chassis with a cat in the top! 'It seems way too familiar', you think!<br><br>You defeat the cat. (lol)<br><br>You get to Earth, where you find out between the time's advanced industry, one of them sends a distress call by a Secretly Rebel Worker (SRB). "Hey mate, there's something chicky going on. I'm a rebel worker in this industry, but don't tell anyone; they are doing some giant military robot for no reason in this New Earth Government!"<br><br>You got to investigate, but as you approach, you and Drake listen beeps. "Uh oh!"<br><br>Dr Syntetic, the brain that started it all! The Branx attack, the evilination of that random cat.<br><br>You defeat him, and the Universe is saved now.</em></p>
