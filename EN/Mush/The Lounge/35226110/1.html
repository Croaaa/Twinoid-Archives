                <p>The ship was this one: <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2073"></a><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2073" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2073</a></p><p>Kuan Ti here and I stole Paola's <em>babe</em> hoping it will make it instantly recognizable to the people on the ship. I was also considering calling it "Roland the sneakiest mush EVER". You can start spilling the beans about your story because I want to know it. I'm just sorry I wasn't online at the right timing to be able to heal you with the serum. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This ship was one of the best I ever was, most people were active and very talkative. The mushes were Roland and Eleesha, that even if her stay was short, got the nickname of general Eleesha by the way she was acting. and she printed the list on day 1 and was refusing to reveal the names to everyone causing quite a drama with us ending up voting for her to drop it and she eventually did it. But only at the bridge so that Paola could make an announcement of the list. Which ended with me, Terrence and Stephen running after her to the bridge because there was a knife in front corridor and we were afraid she would take it to kill Paola. Eleesha's name was on the list but we still gave her another chance... which lasted about one cycle. Then she thought sabotaging a patrol ship was a good idea, I was watching her movements in the tracker and was able to easily figure out what she had done. My dear Paola finished her off right after.</p><p>We had really bad luck with planet scanning even if Frieda was doing an amazing job. Seems a combo of oxygen and volcanos was the favorite in that part of the galaxy. But eventually we started finding some nice planets to visit. On our first expo we had to deal with the fact that Jin Su was only logging in once per day so we got everything ready, announced the expo and then just waited for him to login. But Hua, that never said a single word on the ship decided it was a good time to go outside on a patrol ship, afaik there were not even hunters outside (but there may have been a couple) and to stay outside. Because of our almost inactive commander situation we would either have to chose leaving her to move when Jin Su was online (and he went idle the cycle before he came online so it ended being Chao moving the ship) or wait for an undefined amount of time because she wasn't communicating and then hack the terminal. We chose to leave and seems she didn't really like the choice... But Hua, if you happen to ever read this, there was info about going on an expo as soon as Jin Su was online all over the chat. It's not our problem you weren't reading or talking to us at all... And after this we were left with just one pilot... mush Roland...</p><p>We did a couple more expos where it seems we were having some really bad luck (did you had traitor Roland?), on the same double expo to one planet we lost a drill, rope, compass, lost Ian twice and then Roland too.</p><p>At some point when things were getting complicated with the hunters we decided we couldn't have one commander that was online just once per day so, even if we were fairly sure that Jin Su was human, we decided to kill him. I was sorry about this since he seemed to be a newish player but we really needed an active commander. The title went to Chao that was not super active but was helping a bit more... until he suddenly died of depression... Then the new commander would be Stephen... Stephen wasnt online much and wasn't very talkative either. We were suspecting him to be a mush even if he was working a bit in neron. But we knew at this point that the mush was being helpful (because everyone still alive was!) and Stephen was my strongest suspicion. So we decided to kill him and he turned out to be human. The good thing about this was that Frieda became commander so we finally had an active and trustworthy commander!</p><p>As for the last cycles, I have no idea how we managed to last from day 9 cycle 8 until day 10 cycle 3 with just 13 armor and 26 hunters after us... Frieda couldn't be online at this cycles so Paola and I decided to try to go back to sol on day 9 cycle 8. Except that we failed to hack the terminal (well, better saying, when we hacked it we had no ap left to go back to sol...). Then Finola came to try and the same thing happened to her. We went to day 10 cycle 1 and miraculously we were still alive. Then I went to sleep and woke up today to find that Raluca saved us all on cycle 3! Really impressive that we lasted so long.</p><p>Again, this was really a great ship and I enjoyed a lot playing with all the active ones and I hope we get a chance to be on the same ship again. And enjoyed a little more the conversations with Paola, Frieda and Roland, the initial "trusted inner circle" started by... Roland (how could you do this to us?! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"> )</p>

                <p>Hey <em>babes</em>, Paola here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Wow what a ship that was, definitely far and away my best so far <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> Everyone who was active (as in actually spoke and took part) worked at peak efficiency. We started out with Eleesha acting like Chao, which immediately caused suspicions, the whole thing with the list was really stupid on her part. She should have risked a few days then printed it - even if we'd caught her then she could have assisted the very capable Roland in his Mushiness. I happily blew her brains over the wall and was satisfied that we only had one more Mush to deal with <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So our voyage went on - never have I seen so many people working together on Neron and Research, it was <em>beautiful</em>. I must admit I had something of a <em>golden touch</em> when it came to Comms. Every time I updated firmware of that <em>sweety</em> Neron, he gave us a great project: Extra Hydropots, Armoured Corridors, (I think) Anti-Grav Thrusters and Trail Minimiser. Alongside the plasma shield and a few other great projects that we secured in the Nexus, I thought we might be in for a shot at Eden. Sadly this wasn't to be...</p><p>Every expedition we sent out met with sufficient failure to make our position less tenable - I think Ian got lost twice on the same planet once! It was pretty depressing. Combined with only one pilot, and a succession of insuficiently active Commanders (till my babe Frieda) we were forced to set our sights on Sol.</p><p>This went pretty well - we completed Pilgred and decided to see how long we could last. Freida was Commander and, as I'd finished up Comms, I took the Hacker Kit and preserved AP just in case we needed to move quickly. A sound plan or so it seemed. One thing nearly foiled it utterly. During the course of the voyage several Mush search committees had formed to find the last Mush on board. Everyone was active and <em>seemed</em> to be helping out, and once the suspicious characters were dead (Stephen, Chao etc.) we had literally no idea who the Mush could be - everyone was just being so <em>helpful</em>. In retrospect I imagine that Roland was probably wasting AP and not dealing with Hunters as effectively as he could - but during the flight I trusted him <em>utterly</em>. He was the instigator of most of the Mush search committees, and I treated him as a go to guy alongside that utter <em>babe</em> Kuan. So when, as I was snuggled on my sofa with my hacker kit on the bridge, Roland came in - I did not think anything of it. To be completely honest I almost asked Frieda to leave so that we could Do the Thing for morale/he-has-been-a-<em>babe</em> purposes. Thankfully I didn't - I actually left for about ten minutes and when I came back, <em>oh my</em> the betrayal. Roland had done his best to murder me for the Hacker Kit, and by best I mean best - he'd shot me, and stabbed me, and he <em>cut off my ears</em>, ruining my <em>gorgeous head</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> Frieda, lovely <em>sweet</em> Frieda, saved my life - I'm still not sure how - whether she had the Med Kit already on her, or if she ran to find it, she healed me and kept me alive until Roland ran out of AP. He escaped to the lab. We had the <em>serum</em>, but a red mist came over me - Roland, my <em>babe</em>, who I trusted so utterly, had turned out to be the one think I hated the most: Evil Mushy Mush. So I took my blaster and I blew him apart. The cure was better off on Sol anyway.</p><p>So yeah, a <em>wonderful</em> ship. Much <em>love</em> and many <em>cuddles</em> to all of you who took part <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Oh and we made <em>two</em> sofas. Crowning achievement right there <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

It was not looking that great at the start though, as Chun wasn't only hope, and our initial Commander had a very limited availability, morale would have been our main issue but luckily our Janice did a great work keeping it up as much as possible, and Paola's rebel friends helped us out as well. Ah the wonders of the youth...</p><p>The important parts of our trips have already been told, so I will just talk a little about my job on board.</p><p>Our prime objective, besides Mush hunting, was to find a planet with oxygen. The first few planets I found had none, but had a good share of <em>volcanoes</em>... hateful things are those, I tell you.</p><p>I was starting to loose all hopes but we were lucky enough to have a designer with some astrophysicist skills. Kuan Ti came for help and found us a little planet with oxygen. The planet was however not ideal to my eyes so, as the Commander was still taking nap when I myself woke up the next day, I decided to go for a new scan. Maybe I would be lucky this time and.... finally found a planet with some oxygen but I had one more analysis to carry and ... <em>volcanoes</em> were not missing either... <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>After we filled up the tanks with oxygen, the planet scanning went rather smoothly and the bad luck seemed to be gone... only to be found back ON the planets. But maybe that wasn't really bad luck, and someone's doings, after all ?</p><p>Little note for Paola : when Roland came for you, I was resting my eyes a little, but the noise woke me up. I didn't have the Medikit on me, but as I knew it should be in Bravo Dorm, as I had left it there the last time I had used it. I only hoped that Roland hadn't thought about picking it up before coming to the bridge! I believe he must have used all his strength on you and that Neron protected you until my return. I told you he had a major crush on you!</p>

                <p>Ian here! I've gotta say that this voyage was really something! It all started when we realized that Chun didn't take 'Humanity Last Hope' trait, but focused on medic instead. The morale problems were stemming from that. My lovely plants were moved in the beginning of the flight - from Hydroponics to Lab. As only botanist on board I've taken utmost care to plant sweet, delicious bananas and help the crew by delivering both food and O2. As a side note - the botanist book went unused until the end of the game (:</p><p>One of random Neron updates given me more Hydropots, yet by twist of fate (and a fire in the Lab) some were taken away from me. I've spent most of my time either in Lab or Dorms, but of course took part in two expeditions... sadly both of them were pretty disastrous.</p><p>While I pretty much wasn't around when mush hunts were commencing I also find it strange that only Stephen was suspecting me to be a mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">. Because of my absentmindeness there were a lot of situations when I've got dirty without good reason. Anyway, Roland kinda got me with his turning - but like I wrote before, the fight was long over when I logged in.</p><p>In the end I was thinking that we're going to die either way, so actually surviving and moving back to Sol was a great thing! I also saw that Hua was pretty upset about us leaving her, but still... we couldn't really do anything else - also wasn't there an asteroid on the way? (not really sure about that tho).</p><p>Ah, as the side note I've got to say that I suspected Raluca of being a mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">. And it seems that I wasn't alone. Sadly fruits that could be used to prove somebody human nature were lost in the fire.</p><p>Now that I think about it there was enormous number of fires on Daedalus! Suspicious, right?</p><p>As a side note - who ate like five bananas on the last day? Was it Roland?</p>

                <p>Ok, this is the story I wrote as soon as I got killed. I have to tell you guys, it was hard playing against you.. especially when some of you had hope for Eden. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":tid_shy:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>___________________________________________________________________________</p><p>So here I am, on a new ship, another start. Mr Zuccali aka The Rol-train aka Elite Pilot aka the destroyer of hunters.<br>But not this time, this time I feel strange. There is something in me, something that wants to take control of me. I'm not sure what it is...<br>Crewmembers are defrosting from their cryosleep. We all laugh and take positions, doing our own things. But when the last person became awake, something changed within me.<br>I'm not that funny Roland anymore. I feel a hatred for 'them', those pathetic <strong>Humans</strong>. I want to destroy them, I want to destroy everything that's dear to them. Their friends, their family, their love, their... <strong>HOPE</strong>!</p><p>On a secret channel I heard another crew member mumbling about death wishes to those humans. I recognize her voice, it was <strong>Eleesha.</strong><br>I'm not sure if the infection changed her personality. She became a general, trying to make life horrible on the ship with rules and punishments.<br>I wanted to protect my '<em>new kind</em>', so I asked her to take a low profile. But I was too late... she went berserk and was slaughtered very quickly.</p><p>Shit, this can't be. Now I need to kill them of all by myself. I already learned four skills: Phagocyte, <strong>Traitor</strong>, Trapper and Splashproof. Thinking that <strong>Eleesha</strong> and I could spike people together.<br>Now I need to do it all by myself, but I didn't even have a reason to be dirty so I couldn't explain myself. I needed another strategy, and I needed to stay low, very low.<br>I needed to be trusted, so I talked to <strong>Paola</strong> who acted like one of the leader's on the ship. I said I trusted her and that I had a tool to expose the Mush. She trusted me and together we talked a bit about who we could trust.<br><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> was the next person added to our '<em>inner circle</em>'. The three of us looked at every action taken and I tried them to believe those simple humans were Mush. Every 'dumb' action became a discussion and soon we had a 'could be mush' list.<br>My plan was succeeding and they all trusted me. They never asked what my morale was, if I was hungry.. nothing. <br>The antispore gas was completed quickly and after some cycles it was even harder for me to extract spores. I knew this would happen, so I had to rely on my <strong>Traitor</strong> skill.<br>And boy, this skill comes in handy. As the only pilot of the ship, I was sure to go on expeditions.</p><p>My strategy as only Mush and with almost no chance of converting people was my only good Mush-skill and my ability to talk.. to persuade..<br>Those humans had problems with moving the ship thanks to an inactive <strong>Jin Su</strong>. If we killed him, then <strong>Chao</strong> became Commander. But 'the inner circle' thought that <strong>Chao</strong> could be a Mush.<br>Third in line was <strong>Stephen</strong>, who was also a Mush suspect.<br>At that time we invited <strong>Frieda</strong> to our circle and she would make a good captain.<br>This was my time to try out my human language. I came with the plan to kill three people at once. First <strong>Jin Su</strong> for inactivity. Then <strong>Chao</strong> who eated 'their' rations for shooting at Hunters with turrets and as last <strong>Stephen </strong>who also was on 'our' Mush list.<br>Things didn't went well for me and that filthy <strong>Chao </strong>became a good commander so they stopped after they killed <strong>Jin Su</strong>.</p><p>I came back from my daily routine shooting Hunters (I still was trying to stay low, and wait for a perfect opportunity to create chaos), when I heard some whispers in the dorms. Those <em>small creatures</em> talked about a Serum, a Serum to cure the infection.<br>My human side came back, he talked to me: <em>the cure is there, you can be human again, feel how love feels, how friendship feels</em>. No, I didn't want to become weak again. I am <strong>Mush</strong>. A creature above those pathetic, small, weak, fleshy creatures.<br>But everytime I slept, I dreamed about flying patrolships. Flying above Sol, sometimes even above a new Eden. Smoking a cigarette, enjoying the flight. But that was the old Roland. The new Roland didn't need any of those ships. Didn't need a Sol and definitly didn't needed a Eden. A mush-free world.</p><p>Then came the expeditions again, we lost <strong>Ian</strong> twice thanks to my skill.. but he still found us right before we launched the Icarus to the Daedalus. And then I came lost, but they came back for me.. are they really friends? NO! They are small, weak and need to be crushed!<br>It was day 9 now and the Serum was finished. I know they could heal me, but I choose for another life. I took a blaster and knife, and went to the Bridge. There was she, <em>with her lovely purple hair and her beautifull smile</em>, did I felt love again? It couldn't be, I was a <strong>agent of Mush</strong>. They don't feel love.. or was I still a bit Human?<br>My brain took over and pulled the tricker, and another time and another time. I was out of charges but know there was no way back. <strong>Paola</strong>, <em>my dear</em>, was still alive and I wanted her dead. Maybe I could see her in the after life, maybe thén we could be together. I grabbed my knife and stabbed her a few times, and she still wasn't dead. I was exhausted and felt a strange substance under my eyes. It felt like.. like.. <em>crying</em>!<br>I runned away to the lab, but the Serum was gone...</p><p>A few seconds later, <strong>Paola</strong> came in. She shot me, a filthy mush.. she didn't stopped shooting.. and then there was nothing. Only darkness. No chance to be with <em>my</em> <strong>Paola</strong>, no chance to smoke some cigars with <strong>Kuan Ti</strong>, no chance to hear the stories from <strong>Frieda</strong> about how earth was before the infection.<br><strong><em>Goodbye my love, my friends, my ship.. my humans.</em></strong></p>

                <p>Hah! Nelioka, a great story! I enjoyed just reading about your glorious sneakishness, with a human flavor on it. I'm a stranger to your ship, but couldn't resist to congratulate on your performance. You all did great, but mush always get my sympathy as they are alone, outnumbered and hunted by everyone around. Sometimes it's hard to resist helping humans, as they really get in your head and you start caring for them. Things get even harder when human saves your life a few times. It totally demolishes your mushiness.</p><p>So the story Nelioka gave is indeed a warm hearted one. Be sure, he felt just the way he wrote, as playing as mush on a good ship forces you to fight your own moral principals, betray your friends, and, most of the time, no one knows how you feel, and no one cares. When mush is revealed, it is killed immediately, without a moment of hesitation. No one even writes you a good bye note.</p><p>Good job not taking the serum btw. I know how hard it is sometimes not to shout out "heal me dammit!" But that is the glory of mush. You have to stay your character no matter what.</p><p>A question, if you will, about your survival strategy. 10 days is a lot of time to covert. You had your trapper skill. You didn't used it because you were afraid that without anonimush your cause could be jeopardized if humans reveal they have an active mush? Or you simply couldn't find the means to get enough AP?</p><p>PS: high five Ignatia on your roleplay</p>

First of all I was Roland, who can't get dirty for being a Pilot. So if I extract some spore's, it will already cost me 2 AP to extract and 2 AP to shower. To trap a shelf, that would be 5 AP total. Second problem was that I needed to stay very low, because they were watching everyone very closely. So after a while, when Finola and others finished a lot of research, it would cost me 7 AP trap a shelf again and shower after it. And third: as only Pilot on the ship, they would notice it if I didn't spend my AP killing Hunters or launching Expeditions.</p>

                <p>Sorry for the late reply. Terrance here <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/terrence.png" alt=":mush_terrence_50:" class="tid_ico"> <br>My computer went bonkers at the last day and I had to sent it in for repairs for around a week or so. I only got it back today.</p><p>And I knew it. Roland is Mush. The fact that the spreadsheet you did was so haphazard and there is no information entered for your own row when you should perfectly know for yourself clued me in to something suspicious. Also, you first started one of the major chat and brought up the notion of killing Jin Su, knowing that after we kill him we will have to kill two more people for the role to land safely in Freida's hands.</p><p>Tried convincing the rest about it though, but with two major chats having you in it I have no choice but to create a third with Kuan and Paola who unfortunately didn't believe me. But it is all good.</p><p>As for the rest (even you too Roland) I love you guys. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Even with the rocky start we ended up fine and it was pretty lucky we have two sofas on the bridge.</p>
