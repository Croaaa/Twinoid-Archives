                <p>Hey! The frustrated <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"> here! (It's my first time doing an AP Thread so don't kill me)</p><p>During some time after Mush-Selection our mush Terrence went berserk and attacked Janice (Which is a failure). Some of us thought that the other mush might be inactive because Terrence might've been bored because his buddy is braindead and wants to escape from the ship.. Ralu made the last blow to Terry. Then Stephen started to kill the inactives. ( Idk but I'm sure that it's him because he killed most of the crew.. Including me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">) But the plot twist is.. It was not an inactive..</p><p>To prove that I am human.. I triple ate a banana (since my plants were very abundant on bearing fruits! YAY!) Paola confirmed it.. We only have 3 confirmed humans that moment. Chun, Stephen, and I.</p><p>Regarding of the Subject! Our CHUN always forget to drop the APRON! ( I might've suspect that she's using mobile because she's focused on the research area) since I'm Ian, I needed to use it for my precious plants and for doing research ( I read the Biologist magebook). Out of my frustration I hit her with my knife! (She died because of her injuries before the cycle I was killed)</p><p>I'm starting to suspect Janice since it might be just a Mush Tactic that Terrence attacked her for us not to be suspicious of her.. Guess what? She isn't! I knocked her off the bed and after few cycles! BOOM! I'm dead! I was killed by Stephen.. That's the only story that I could tell since I died before the remaining crew went to Sol!</p><p>Note: Roland was the other Mush, he's been very quiet that's why we didn't suspect him that much.</p><p>You can see the Honour List here<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8434" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8434</a></p>
