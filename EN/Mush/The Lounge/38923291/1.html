                <p>What a trip! Kuan Ti here, and I would just like to say that this is what Mush is all about. Success and failures, drama (maybe a little too much), and working together. But let's break it down for the people who didn't come along.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4251">End Page</a></p><p><span class="tid_strike">-BEGIN TL;DR</span>-</p><p>The start was a little rough. We had a wonderful fresh newbie Ian, who was already eagerly going about his duties. However, he made two mistakes: posting that he was dirty and had no idea how he'd gotten that way, and left out part of his actions that seemed very suspicious. I'm sorry that we killed you, but that's how the game goes sometimes. Better luck on your next ship!</p><p>Then our apparently inactive Derek woke... and turned out to be a griefer. He grabbed all the weapons he could get his hands on and went for Chun. Unfortunately for him, she was online and had the knife. He seriously hurt her and deafened her, but she survived and was able to receive help.</p><p>Next, was the first Bed Tantrum. Our pilot Andie, also fairly new, staked a claim on a bed... and was very displeased to find it occupied when they returned from shooting down hunters. The first we knew about it was a chat message that went something along the lines of "HOW COULD YOU WAAAAHHHH" (yes, actually 'waah' ). It got obnoxious very quickly, but eventually it blew over. (Andie later proved themselves fairly useful and pulled their weight. As such, I'd like to apologize again for being cranky while I thought you were being an entitled brat.)</p><p>Then, <em>the</em> Bed Tantrum. Hua returned from Piloting and,seeing Janice in a bed, was displeased. Janice should not require a bed, she thought, oblivious to the hard work Janice had been doing in Neron research and coordinating morale. Janice is only good for standing around to help boost people's morale, she thought. So she sent Janice a message asking her to get out, and when Janice declined, she punched Janice out of the bed and took it.</p><p>We did not learn of it through Janice. Eleesha, who was sleeping in that dorm, reported it and asked Hua to explain herself. Janice's response was to beat Hua to within an inch of her life. An argument broke out in the chat, with Hua and Janice screaming at each other, and Eleesha and I asking people to calm the heck down. Hua eventually subsided, but not before knocking Janice out of the bed again to prove her dominance.</p><p>Janice lost it, laying into Hua again and taking away the sliver of life she had left. When Eleesha and I disapproved and told her that the reaction was completely unjustified, she raged further. She spent the last of what had apparently been a full AP bar (contrary to her claim of needing the bed more) throwing punches at Eleesha, telling us that we should go ahead and kill her; she felt that without her, the ship would die from lack of morale. So we did. While her skills were extremely useful, we did not want such a toxic attitude as part of our crew.</p><p>Things started to look grim, then. We still hadn't done ANY anti-Mush research and had no leads on any suspects, meaning there were a lot of possible spores out there. Eleesha got to work, and finally found something odd: Raluca had barely done any work on Pilgred - only as much as the free Physician points would do, yet she hadn't put any AP into Neron projects. Not only that, but of all the people that could have relayed her, Jin Su had - apparently on private request, since he made no mention of the fact that he was back there. Eleesha scoured the logs until we had enough proof, and sure enough, Raluca was Mush. Unfortunately that meant that Schrodinger had to go as well, since he had been cuddled since the Mush were selected. Additionally, it put further suspicion on Jin Su, as he had not only relayed with Raluca without visible request, but he had been the one to bring Schrodinger to where he was accessible to the crew.</p><p>We knew Jin Su had to die, but our oxygen was critically low. So we played off like we didn't know, and organized an expedition. Jin Su "went offline" in Icarus Bay, willing to be a body especially since we knew there was still a mush out there. Stephen joined him, and Paola and Terrence were on their way together after a morale boosting session. So it caught us all by surprise when the expedition launched - with only three people. Jin Su had waited for Terrence to enter the room and clicked the button before Paola could follow. This made us worried - Stephen had been sarcastic and rebellious in chat, objecting how the Mush Hunt was being handled, and thus was suspicious, Jin Su was almost certainly a Mush. That meant that if they had the right skills, we could lose our only technician to accidents. Imagine our surprise when Terrence came back, alive and fine, the ship had gained full oxygen.... and it was Stephen who got lost planetside.</p><p>Frantically, we tried to plan a rescue, hindered by the same poor coordination that had hindered the Research. Stephen even requested that we leave him if we couldn't be bothered coming down to save him. We were sure that Jin Su would try to leave if we went down to get Stephen, dooming the ship, but if we killed Jin Su then, Stephen would have died from morale loss.</p><p>Then, Jin Su made his move. He grabbed the soap, a fire extinguisher, and a container of fuel, and flew off the ship in a fighter. Demands that he return were futile, since not only had he resigned himself to his fate, but he had dropped his talkie and couldn't hear us. We hurriedly launched the expedition to save Stephen while having the Front Corridor guarded, so he couldn't land and jump the ship, but he didn't even try. After we found our lost cook and a bit of discussion, we jumped the ship, leaving Jin Su behind to his small victory.</p><p>After that, things fell into place. We were gifted with the best mage-books: technician, biologist, and diplomat. Terrence and I (with the help of the tech book), started working on Pilgred. We started researching again, led by Chun (with the Biologist book) and Eleesha, who had plenty of AP to spare since she wasn't tracking mush anymore; working on Pheromodem to be sure that we were mush-free (it would at least inform us if people were getting spored). Mycoscans showed us all to be clean. Andie took the Diplomat book to help us in the quest for artifacts, extra drones were made, Neron updates gave us Plasma Shield and other wonderful toys. Unfortunately, it was too much. Things were breaking down at an incredible pace, the hunters were swarming, and our new commander, Gioele, was having trouble getting online. Without a regularly active commander, we didn't have a good chance at Eden, so we finished the serum and returned home.</p><p><span class="tid_strike">-END TL;DR</span>-</p><p>This has been my best and most eventful ship yet. Special shoutouts to the crew:</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> - for being one mean, mush-tracking machine. Seriously, I am glad I wasn't Mush because you were scary good.<br><strong>Chun</strong> - Didn't talk much in chat, but you were there helping with research and you were a <em>Sex Demon</em>. I think you alone were responsible for a great deal of the morale boosting going on. I'm sorry about your coprolalia, but it was pretty funny.<br><strong>Terrence</strong> - for taking one for the team and being our Technician, as much as you wanted to play with the drones. Also for hilarious RP and being a chill dude in general.<br><strong>Paola</strong> - the COMMS master! I'm so sorry you got steel plated before anybody could see you had been hurt, and I wish you and Terry Jr. sweet rest among the stars. If only you had stayed on the bridge even though all the coms work was finished!<br><strong>Roland</strong> - for being the experienced player and knowing what to focus on. Your hunting skills were invaluable.<br><strong>Andie</strong> - for being quick to learn and taking our teasing with fairly good humor.</p><p>Hope to see you all again!</p>

                <p>Eleesha checking in. Definitely an interesting voyage, and glad to be part of it. Don't play Eleesha often because I consider it the most intense job, especially since I RP it as an overzealous mush hunter (although I don't do full immersion RP when there are clear newbies), which is to be honest emotionally draining since it's a pretty abrasive role and requires me to be suspicious of everyone even when it's mostly clear that the mush are dead. Also this was an especially high pressure ship because of the slow research and griefers - the inactivity and inefficiency in the ship was sufficient to cloak fairly aggressive mush play. I had some very public fights with Stephen, but to be honest that mostly only occurred because I didn't really think he was Mush - the actual Mush I never openly cast doubt on until shooting them in the face. Not that I didn't suspect him...he just wasn't my top two suspects.</p><p>I'm still surprised more sporing didn't go on - not really sure what the point of being as inactive as Raluca was while dirty if you're not sporing, Also, sorry about the early death Ian - but you honestly accidentally did pretty much the most suspicious movements and actions pretty much possible and didn't have the experience to correctly report your actions when asked.</p><p>As the ship wound down, I didn't really have much to do except blow most of my AP gardening - it was crazy how many plants were getting diseased. Also, does coproralia usually last that long? Felt like Chun had that for half the voyage!</p><p>Psst, slight inaccuracy on Janice having a full AP bar, I concluded that she had spent her entire AP bar of 8 attacking Hua with murderous intent and stopped when she ran out of AP. Then after getting knocked out of the bed again, she went to the kitchen to eat a ration, then came back spending 2 AP killing Hua, then after she raged further, 2 AP attacking me. Annoying to have to spend the AP killing her since it was near the end of the 3rd day which is when I usually have enough evidence to kill the first mush and it made finishing off the first mush by end of day far more difficult than it should have been.</p>

                <p>Ah, that makes more sense. I remember just counting attacks and being surprised at how many she launched. It was such a waste - of AP, of her abilities, of a pilot.... if they had both just calmed down, there's no telling how far we could have gotten.</p><p>As for Chun's corprolalia, I think it's one of the conditions that can only be cured by a pill or a Shrink. Too bad our Shrink decided we weren't worth the effort. I think she got it from helping to kill Raluca.</p><p>Thank you so much for putting up with us babies and sharing your knowledge!</p>

                <p>Hi there, Eleesha and Kuan! I was Terrence. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It was really a fun ship. In fact, it was my first ship to last day 10 and will be forever memorable and close to me. Now that you list the helpful people, I am amazed that it took only 8 people to make this ship last. I was and still am positive that we will be able to make it longer and in fact go to eden, if it was not for our inactive captain, sorry Geiole I just have to say it. Well we have Frieda who is constant in her dedication to finding us planet, abeit not that talkative, and Andi with her diplomat plus the babel module that makes us in theory a beast in finding artifact. Roland is active enough and is experienced too to keep those hunters, I mean aracks and trax <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> , at bay.</p><p>It was also good to remember that in the first couple of days, we were in such a peril. We have not finish antispore gas at day 2 if I remember it right. And project to research ratio was in a staggering 4:1 I think. Eleesha even though she showed sharp logic and dedication has lost some of her credibility because Stephen had challenged her in general chat with long paragraphs worth of suspicion after Ian, an innocent hippie, was killed.</p><p>Well, regarding Eleesha. The moment she presented all her evidences and logical deductions I immediately throw off my suspicion of her. She was so dedicated that I can't help but pity the Mush, I know it's a grave sin to pity the mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> . I just don't like the constant banter between you and Stephy though, it dampens the romantic mood set by the stars that can be seen from the windows of the Deadalus. But it's all good, because when we go back to Sol you're in my "People I miss back in space."</p><p>Also Chun. You talk like, in internet slang, a russian teenage dirt bag. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> But I can attest to Kuan's testimony that you're a sex machine. Thank you for keeping my friend's moral at bay and picking up the pace in research. You did well!!! Thank you for finishing the serum on time and for securing the mage bok from the mush by reading it without our knowledge. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"> About that sex machine thing. You guys remember that I posted in the moral thread something like; "Im sorry Paola, Chun did something horrible to me." You know what did she do? She <strong>rape</strong> me. (No further comment)</p><p>Like with the other crew, I can't help but be sorry for Janice and Hua also. They killed each other for a bed. Boy on earth, you would make headlines in a tabloid. Well Andi, it was partially your fault. You started it. But don't worry it was one of my funniest moments in Mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I feel bad for Jin Su too. I remember I was one of the first one to wake up and he seems nice. I am in an impression that he just wants to play a good human Jin Su. It was sad that the mush fate has dawned upon him, dooming his chance to play a good human and denying us a good captain. Maybe this is the reason why he choose a "light" last resort to screw us humans.</p><p>Also Kuan! Thank you for the relays and wheelchairing !!! You also fix a lot of things going on the last days!!! You move and work from the bridge to the engine room almost everyday that I consider you a martyr! You're a chinese superman, and I mean it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Roland too, your hands are full with hunters already but still you try to manage doing menial but useful stuff like looking for equipments and searching for fires.</p><p>Andi, your humour and quirkness did me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But please, don't be too bratty on your future ships, you're lucky that we are a tolerating bunch of crew. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Anyway, thank you for doing your job. Our plasma shield is barely scratched, thanks to you and roland and some ship moving.</p><p>Eleesha and Stephen. drop your seriousness once in a while. You two were great. Thank you!</p><p>Paola!!! I pray every day for your soul in heaven! Also Terry junior. Damn, you were such a painful lost. For completing all the rebel base and upgrading plasma shield, neron repaid you with a steel plate. What cruel misfortune!</p><p>Thank you too for playing in the mush channel! I was the one who requested the fuel-eting skill of mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It is interesting to note our main problems going on the final days: ration, fuel, fires, moral, and equipment. Well for a ship that lost Janice and Jin Su early we did superb in checking our moral! So kudos to us!</p><p>Well there's more I''ve got to say but it's lost on my mind. I just want to elaborate that this ship was fun. It was a pleasure being with you guys. Thank you. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p><strong><em>Roland</em></strong> here! Man what a crazy ship that was. By Day 2 or 3 there were 4 Humans dead and 2 Active Mush still rooting around.</p><p>Eleesha was brutal, I had never seen a true Eleesha before (they usually AFK or are half effective) and it was a sight to behold. I felt really empowered until we kill innocent Ian. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> Still all the evidence pointed to him. It didn't help he gave false or forgotten information (he swore he was clean before the dorm, but there was simply no time to slime trap. He HAD to have gotten dirty gardening or something!)</p><p>Then Derek going griefer and then Hua and Janice committing suicide and us no closer to figuring out Mush.</p><p>Still we had clues. Jin Su had done some planet scanning even though Gioele and Frieda were somewhat active and had astrophysicist. After those first frustrating days Eleesha printed the list early and we got really lucky that several of the names on the list were already dead.</p><p>I still disagree that we should've let Jin Su live. He was secretly relaying PILGRED with Mush Raluca and doing stupid stuff. I know we needed him to do commander things but I think at that point even semi-active Gioele would've been a better bet. Once Raluca was dead I think that was a clear sign to Jin that we were on to him or real close. STILL he did start that expo and got us O2 which was a terrible idea considering how low we were. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>All in all if we hadn't lost Hua and Janice to a stupid bed fight I think we would've gone the distance. Andie was just a smidge sporadic and she was the only other Pilot on board. She also wasn't Polyvalent which is terrible.</p><p>Still we did make it to Day 10. I was still half sure that Eleesha was slow playing Mush after all this. Demanding to finish mushovore before Pheromodem just seemed like stalling so the Mush channel would clear, and as it turns out, it didn't take as many AP as she said it would. I wasted quite a few MP and AP wandering the ship checking logs to make sure there wasn't. Also Frieda was being semi-inactive, barely talking, and dumping planet after planet.</p><p>I appreciate the hard work of all the remaining actives on the ship. Chun was hilarious, Stephen did some good work in the end despite almost have another hissy fit with Eleesha early on, and Terrence and KT did serious work in the backfield.</p><p>See you guys in another ship! Would really like to see what Raluca and Jin have to say about their plays. I'm still confused as to their plans. I'm assuming they were going to quietly advance PILGRED and then auto jump to Sol, but that works best in the background. Just do PILGRED as normal but ask for an artificially high stop threshold (lots of people will do 80% forgetting that if Raluca is Mush that last 20% isn't that hard with a relayer). Jin could have played legit (and Raluca) and if you had just done that until PILGRED was close, you could just auto-won.</p>

                <p>Paola here!</p><p>I loved that ship. It was a pity I got steel plated so suddenly. It was full of paranoia and I loved how we had two or three mush hunts at the same time, and even in the end we weren't sure about Eleesha or Frieda being humans. Maybe we weren't that lucky with inactives and griefers but it was intense and how a real game of mush should be, feeling you can be backstabbed at any time.</p><p>It was a pleasure to play with you all. Eleesha was brutal, Kuan and Terrence took care of our ship, Andie created some fun situations and Roland as the veteran who was protecting all of us.</p><p>I died while carrying Terry Jr in my belly. Neron hated me after upgrading it with that new plasma shield. What a bad luck.</p><p>Hope to see you again in some other ship.</p>
