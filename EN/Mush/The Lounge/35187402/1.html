                <p>As a start, let me say that this was one of the worst ships I have ever seem to play as a MUSH. And that means you were doing a pretty damn good job! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2156">please follow this beatiful and finely crafted link</a></p><p>By the way, I was Hua.</p><p>D1: Slow day. The ship was filing slowly, so we all could play paranoia-free for a while, while the lab crew hurried to finish the Antispore gas and the rest of us joked about how it would come back to haunt the ones who were chosen to be MUSH. Gioelle (or Chao) tells us that he got two extra cameras for this game.</p><p>D2: With the ASG finally completed, I comment about how I really would not like to be a MUSH in this round. As fate would have it, my page reloads to shown me that I have been infected and my message was posted <strong>after</strong> the selection. Talk about bad timing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> But it's ok, none of you seemed to mind that strange timing and I get around to see who is my MUSH partner: Frieda! Great! With her scanning for planets and me being a guaranteed member of the away team we would be able to wreak havoc on expeditions. A shame about those spores, though... I kept trying to hail her in our MUSHy hive-mind communication but receive no answer. I landed to produce some spores only to discover that she had already made two of then. Annoying but manageable, I could make more on D3. Frieda then proceeds to spore someone in front of a camera within the hour, is killed and leaves me alone. All the while the research team is cracking their backs to produce antispore alarms. It's also by this time that Kuan-Ti starts acting in a really suspicious manner and we get to murder him <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"> too bad he wasn't a MUSH <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>D3: The alarms are done. So just as a recap: We had 5 cameras, 5 alarms and I still hadn't been able to produce a single spore <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> Quite the despairing situation from my side, but good luck for you guys <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> it's by this time that I formulate my plan: With Frieda out of the game, you would have a hard time finding planets and restocking in oxygen. So that would be my weapon of mass destruction: <strong>AIR!</strong> Or lack thereof. What I really wanted to do was sabotage an expedition, then when we were back to the Deadalus grab a bunch of plants and jump into space, leaving you to suffocate. Before that, I would have to be more human then anyone else, to be always above suspicion. But temptation would come all too soon...</p><p>D3 (still): The RNG breaks both fuel tanks AT THE SAME TIME! And just after Raluca had passed by then! It was fun to see the paranoia taking over, too bad another linch mob wasn't formed...</p><p>D4: That fire! I initially set out having the real intention of putting it off. When I finally found it, I noticed I was the only one looking for it... And temptation won. I left the room planning to wait for the end of the cycle and run back carrying all the plants to that room, effectively burning it all away and destroying the pots permanently! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p><p>And then Raluca walks in and puts it out <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> I'm left with one question: Did she notice that I was on the room after the fire had started? Was she talking with people she could trust and planning on putting an end to my days? I could not afford to wait and be brutally murdered in my sleep. So I went off, took both of our mature banana trees and jumped on a ship. At best you would have me tagging along for a few more cycles, giving me the time to kill the plants I had and steal the other ones. At worst you would leave me behind and I would take half of the oxygen production of the ship with me, forcing a death by suffocation or an early return to Sol.</p><p>I didn't have much to do or to plan up on the Epopine, so that's the reason I had the time and inspiration for all the crazy speech <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So, fellow crewmates... What was your viewpoint on the things that happened?</p>

                <p>We'll I played as chao and just let me say raluca was silent about it at least as far as I know and in my opinion you really should of waited to put your plan in action cause I don't think literally anyone suspected you prior to your speech and even then I had to literally remind some people you were mush and have said as much on the open channel also we were closer to dying of armor loss then 02 oddly enough</p>

I fell on the trap of assuming all the humans were played by Sherlock Holmes and you would see my every little last move.</p><p>I wonder what would have happened if I had enacted my plan (albeit to soon) but had kept quiet about it. Raluca didn't pay attention to the logs (assuming by the fact that everyone was still surprised of me being a MUSH) and even Ian didn't check the logs to see that I had taken half the plants alway (cause otherwise you would have taken me back to the ship and killed me there instead of stranding me).</p><p>But funny how you almost died from lack of armour, since until D4 there had been no pursuit at all <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink2.png" alt=":wink:" class="tid_ico"></p>
