In over a year of playing this game pretty continuously this ship was only my third time being selected as alpha mush. And I had an active, experienced partner to boot! It was glorious. Definitely the most fun I've had on a mush ship in a long time.</p><p>Terrence here, by the way. Apparently that's what I have to do to roll mush.... my second time was over ten months ago, and the only other time I played as Terrence.</p><p>Hats off to alpha mush partner Jin Su. You were spectacular. <br>Also huge thanks to Jin, Paola, and Gioele staying up late for the mushing hour on a few days.</p><p>Full summary from my point of view coming shortly.</p>

                <p><em>How we ended up with 9 mush to Sol</em></p><p><strong>Phase 1</strong><br>Day 2, ship starts. Jin and I selected as mush. After discussing our goals for the game, we agree that we wish to convert the ship, and that rampage is not to be considered unless all other options are closed to us.</p><p>I establish myself as an active, productive member of the crew. As a gold level 3 Terrence, I'm certainly a valuable member. Build the sofa, shoot some hunters, the usual. I also make my standard posts trying to organize the team.</p><p>I start <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/f39af5893a21d9ab5d2f9f685f2c85b1.png">arguing with Ian</a> about the validity of doing mycoalarms as first research, end of day 2 I think it was. I would have said the same thing whether human or mush, and was very, very tempted by this conversation to prove my point... with the knife. It was cycle 8, Jin and I both had 2 spores on us, and Jin had mycelium spirit, phagocyte, infector and fertile... so 5 spores coming to us at day change, one of which would be free. And the knife lying on the shelf. We could have killed half the crew. But where's the fun in that?</p><p>Second day, Jin and I converted Kuan Ti, who turned out was once a day login, fairly new player, who had gone offline in front corridor. We'd gone on a quick expedition, and it was time to leave orbit.... problem: Jin Su miscaluclated his AP from turning Kuan Ti and was stuck on the bridge unable to leave orbit. He blamed it on a broken lateral reactor, claiming he couldn't leave orbit and was going to bed. He was immediately under heavy suspicion from Hua, Gioele and Paola. Next target: Paola, since she and I were the main pilots and trapping bays to get her seemed easiest.</p><p>When Jin woke, and decided to leave orbit, Hua also decided to go collect scrap in the pasiphae, and did so in the seconds between him checking a turret to see if anyone was outside and clicking leave orbit. Hua was dead, the pasiphae lost, and Jin Su more suspect than ever. Thankfully, Paola compared the time stamps on him leaving the turret and her take-off to confirm that yes, it truly did appear to be an honest mistake.</p><p>At this time, I could have simply stopped piloting and the ship would have blown up. I was the only one doing it. But we were determined to lead these humans to peace and prosperity.</p><p><strong>Phase 2</strong><br>With Jin Su under heavy suspicion and no idea how useful Kuan would or wouldn't be, I worked hard to establish my humanity. I faked gaining AP from eating a ration while piloting. I opened up a pm tab with the humans we assessed to be the biggest threat to our mission of bringing the humans peace- the Rinaldos. I suggested to them that while yes, it did appear that Jin Su was mush, I couldn't handle piloting by myself, and given that Janice was terribly unreliable, we needed his leader ability as well, so we should find the other mush and cure him.</p><p>I also began talking with Eleesha, who immediately shared her suspicions with me. I did my best to guide her, while not doing so too well... for instance, she was suspicious of Ian for not being at full health, even though he has never been to bravo dorm or dirty. I pointed this out. I gained her trust. I asked her when she was going to print the list, she wasn't sure, and took my advice to print it sooner rather than later, since we had little research and she had no clear suspects. Myself, newbie sprinter Roland, Eleesha, Frieda, Raluca and Chun were on the list. Eleesha immediately declared the mush on the list to be either Frieda or Raluca, probably Raluca, and wanted to kill her. I did my best to stall, since we wanted to convert as many as possible, and I hoped to do a convert-and-kill on Eleesha to get a list mush dead and buy us breathing room.</p><p>However, Jin came up with a better plan. A bold plan, one that wouldn't work on a ship with anyone active collecting logs, or with research being completed (at this point only antispore gas was done, if I remember correctly). We refined it, and right before day change, acted.</p><p>We readied 2 spores each. Jin went up to the bridge about an hour before day change. Knowing that Paola at least was online, I entered the bridge 30 seconds to day change, took down the bridge camera, and spiked her once. Jin Su delivered the other two spores, left the bridge, made two more right at day change. He came back and we turned Gioele as well. I put the camera back up, detoured to the lab to fix the apron which had been broken in a fire, and went back to bed. Kuan Ti and Paola took anonymush. We were now 5 and humans none the wiser. We held our breath and waited to see if any would enter the bridge and see the logs of my taking down and putting back up the camera with four of us there.... No one did.</p><p><strong>Phase 3</strong><br>From there on out, we didn't bother much with subtlety. Eleesha tried to kill Raluca and failed because no one would help her. I spoked to Eleesha and Raluca one on one to try to diffuse the situation. It worked for about a day, and then Eleesha got impatient and killed Raluca. Eleesha panicked at having killed a human, and food tested herself, so there went the idea of a convert-and-kill to pin her as list mush. Ian had also food tested himself, using bananas instead of planting them... during an O2 crisis no less. When questioned on this, he responded that he was saving the pots for alien fruits. As a human, I would have pointed out that you can graft onto young plants and his selfish play was actively hurting the ship. As a mush, I had bigger things to worry about, and simply decided that I'd rather shoot him with the natamy he was working on instead of converting him.</p><p>We ended up converting mostly inactive pilot Frieda and killing her, with Gioele going to far as to pick up the mycoalarm in the room she was in so w could turn her, then put it back, declaring in chat that it was useless in a room with a mush. And there was the dead 'list mush.' We could all relax a bit.</p><p>Attention then turned to Janice. She was mostly silent, wandering through bravo dorm and the refectory several times... possibly eating many rations without cooking them. She was also holding the knife at that point, and went idle in the lab for quite some time instead of a dorm, despite being asked at the beginning of the ship when she was in the medlab to always make sure she can get back to a dorm. Eleesha kept asking where her AP was going.... where indeed? I can only assume she was the one relaying research with Ian, but when Eleesha speculated, Ian never volunteered this information... I do not know whether or not Eleesha checked this for herself. I spoke with Janice one on one... she would not drop the knife for Eleesha, who she deemed paranoid, but she would, and did, for me.</p><p>Ian finished the natamy, Eleesha grabbed it and brought it to the dorms, ready to blast Janice with it. I suggested we ask Jin Su to do it to see how he reacted at the idea of killing our 'known mush.' It wasn't a suggestion I expected her to go along with, but I only needed to stall her until the end of the day, when we could awaken more. It was, quite simply, an attempt to prevent senseless deaths, and it worked. Eleesha ended up dropping the natamy in RC and going to sleep. I collected it.</p><p><em>(to be continued...<br>Edit: Or not... good lord that is a giant wall of text and I need to be less in love with words)</em></p>

In the lead up for the expo, i grabbed 3 spores before the expedition, Terry grabbed the other 2. i used one on Kuan Ti and ate the other two (since i was going on expo, i couldnt really show hp loss from sneaky showers.).</p><p>We only managed to do it shortly after day change <strong><em>which broke the lateral engine</em></strong>. i quickly loaded fuel, got dirty loading fuel and grabbed 4 spores, ate 2, took my only shower with the soap and started countdown with terrence to time his anonymush. 30 seconds later we still had 2 mush on the bar, but had a new brother.</p><p>unfortunatly, i managed to forget the 1ap cost for infecting and was onthe bridge with 2mp and 0ap. and i had loaudly been proclaiming i would deorbit us for planet scans <strong>facepalm</strong>. So i just put in all chat i couldn't deorbit us for some reason and that i would do it once i woke up. this of course made certain people suspicous about me.</p><p>Then came my second mistake, i woke up relativly early, i checked the turret and the map and no one outside, all our pilots on the map, and Hua all alone in alpha bay. seemed like such a sad timing, i had used my infects for the day.</p><p>So, i take us off and. Bam, Hua is dead. wait what? This is my first time abandoning a person and i panick. i tell everyone willing to listen it was an accident (it was) and that if they check me going in turret and Hua taking off they could see that it was just horrible timing. i also now realised why Hua was in alpha bay 1 alone unprotected.</p><p>after about 15 minutes of panick attacks, paola verified my story, and me and Terry really wanting to have Hua join us (he said she sounded expierienced), i am a mush and killing her accidently does give us an edge.</p><p>Oh, and Kuan Ti is active. He was just akward time zoning and logged of in FC. something like that? he wasn't super active but would soon be very usefull.</p><p>Paola and Gioelle seem to be real close father and daughter and worse, onto me. but Thanks to silver tongue Terrence Mad Wheels Archer, there were other suspects. still, we were having troubles finding strategies until i suddenly had my first super daring plan. See Frieda was a Pilot, once a day thing and Kuan slept in alpha dorm. so Gioelle was our astro person and the three of us shared the bridge.</p><p>The plan was a double conversion, at day change. Terrence would remove the camera we convert Paola, i grab new spores in turret after day change and we convert Gio. we hang back the camera and we go back to BDorm.</p><p>as a bonus, Kuan was totally loving the plan and was going to take anonymush. as a risk reward thing, Paola was online (i think probably related to rebel bases being cycle 1?) during that time.</p><p>SO on that day, Paola gave me a bravo dorm excuse as a <em>mush test</em>. she wanted me to do speeches in the bridge and the dorms for morale. so, 2 speeches and a stealth shower later, i had my 2 spores. i think asg was finished by now but terry still had 1 spore left, so he only needed the 3rd spore of the day to be fully ready. In the end, it went perfect. we got paola, Kuan got anonymush, we got giole, paola took anonymush. perfect.</p><p>didnt see that coming <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">. The team that was leading the jin su is mush team was converted. Team eleesha had the list printed with terrence on it but due toi terrence being the most smooth talker ever, team eleesha had 2 suspects. Raluca who failed to report dirty once or Frieda, who just took off fighting hunters all the time. Terrence was trying to buy time and prevent those two off killing each other so we could recharge spores.</p><p>we ended up working on 100s of plans there but in the end due to eleesha (who was also on the list) killing raluca and proving she was human by vomiting all over, we had to convert Frieda and kill her. since Gio took anonymush, it looked like we just gotten one of the alpha mushes. thanks to some horrible acting skills on our part, no one noticed the set up.</p><p>For our next plan, i suggested a green jelly double conversion in both dorms, wich could only work if the green jely happened in two diffrent days. we ended up not green jellying the cameras (no one had green jelly) and gues what happens? the cameras in both dorms break cycle 6 and cycle 7. and Derek suddenly got his second wind, thinking up green jelly (nope).</p><p>SO, we decided, our next double conversion is Derek and Eleesha. cause Ian cant really kill and Roland, Janice and Chun are low active people (Andie and Stephen were inactives and died).</p><p>So, Paola removed the camera this time, i triple spored eleesha and she and Gioelle converted Derek. Terrence stayed in Bravo dorm and could claim to be still human. no anonymush this time.<br>everything went perfect until ...</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://i60.tinypic.com/1iybgw.jpg"></a><a href="http://i60.tinypic.com/1iybgw.jpg" target="_blank">http://i60.tinypic.com/1iybgw.jpg</a></p><p>Roland managed to catch two people out of three dirty in alphadorm (missed me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">) in the 10 second sthey were there but failed to mention that there were suddenly 3 mushes.

                <p><strong>Phase 4</strong><br>Day change 5 to 6, we converted Eleesha and Derek. They were both in alpha dorm, along with Janice, Roland and Kuan Ti. We did it quite simply, using the same strategy Jin and I used on the bridge. Paola snagged our final weapon on her way down in case the humans decided to react. Then she removed the camera from alpha dorm a couple minutes before cycle change. Jin Su spiked Eleesha before day change, then twice after. Paola spiked Derek before day change, then she and Gioele spiked him after. She put the camera back up. Roland noticed, but did not question Jin Su's activity, only the Rinaldos. We did a quick thinking, and based on <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/8445db8da8bcdca15c6e27c24878550c.png">this earlier conversation</a>, where Ian wants mycoalarms in dorms due to a random camera break, I suggest Paola justify it by saying she was moving the camera because of that. It was a flimsy excuse at best, but there are 4 humans left, 3 barely active/inexperienced and Ian who could not retaliate, especially given that we had control of all weapons. Paola delivered <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/2f3acb1e664d56edb4ab703694b4ec0b.png">her reasoning</a> and was not questioned again. Oddly enough, Roland does not comment on the fact that where there was before 1 mush on the bar, now there are 3.</p><p>When Eleesha and Derek came online, we found out that they were level 11 and 14 mush, respectively, so we got our third and fourth mycelium spirit mushes. (I had finally gotten the exp and taken it about a day prior.) This shocked me, as I had assumed both of them were pretty new. But was a nice plus. In keeping with her general playstyle, Eleesha extracted our last daily spore which we'd asked Derek to do since he had fertile and could do it for free, and would be around to use it. Didn't muck us up too badly.</p><p>Next day change, we got Ian and Janice, and Paola transferred into newbie Roland so that we would have another active pilot. Now-Roland read the tech book, and over the course of the day he, non-tech Kuan Ti and I did PILGRED from about 10% to 100.</p><p>Then 17 hunters decided to appear when none of our pilots had AP. So Chun was killed and we went back to Sol without converting Now-Paola...which was a shame... they <a target="_blank" href="http://i.gyazo.com/a2fd74c3d0216ccf748bc2bff01f6e67.png">took the transfer rather well</a>.</p>

                <p>Janice here. If you doubt me for going into the refectory to eat 3 times (AP of which I spent on research, without a relay buddy) as well as accusing the most likely to be dirty member of the crew, who you killed in the end, I was not like to trust you. And yes, I was a really bad Janice, that was my first game ever interacting with Neron and the Nexus; it was only my most recent game where I have come to fully understand the abilities of Janice as a morale booster.</p>

                <p>Yeah, doing research or projects without relaying is generally not a good idea... unless you have a skill for it and do it twice before a relay because 1:1 isn't possible. I probably would have explained this to you, and pointed out to the others that you looked more newbie - no shrink skill in medlab before selection, some misconceptions about game mechanics which you mentioned one on one to me, but... that would have went a bit counter to my plans. ^^; Glad Eleesha didn't get the chance to murder you before we got to her. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Hope your other ships go better for your side. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
