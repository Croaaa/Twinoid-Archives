                <p>This was my first time playing as a Mush and the experience was so funny that I had to share it in the forums here. Hope you guys enjoy it. After playing Bronze for so long, I finally succeeded in leveling up Kuan Ti to Level 4 and choose the Technician skill. All ready to help the crew out until...</p><p><strong><em>Prologue</em></strong><br>After the long cryogenic journey, the Kuan Ti, the Grandest Architect of the Daedalus steps to admire his creation. But what is this? He feels weird and funny. Undeniably euphoric and powerful, he has joined the powerful Collective known as the Mush. Thus begins his journey to to the Dark Side. Sweeping through the Daedalus with his almost telepathic and telekinetic powers, our Hero quickly grabs the Two Blasters and the Scooter, before anyone of the other members find out.</p><p><strong>Partner in Crime</strong><br>Unknown unbeknownst to Kuan Ti, another formdable Mush in the form of Paola had grabbed the Plasentite Armor, a grenade and a Knife. She also took the Hard Boiled perk before sleeping peacefully for the whole day to plan for the next days dastardly deeds.</p><p><strong><em>Day 2 Begins</em></strong></p><p><strong>Opponents 1: Roland and Raluca (the Human Wonder Duo tag-team)</strong><br>Whilst Raluca was sleeping, our Grand Architect went around sabotaging what he could including hiding the Neron kit at the Nexus Room, hiding the wrench at the Rear Corridor, hiding the Medikit at the Front Storage. After that, he spored two spores.</p><p><em>Mistake 1</em>: He posted about fixing something and becoming dirty although this was not the case. He then took the soap and showered.</p><p><em>Mistake 2</em>: Totally ignoring overbearing nagging by Roland to dismantle the shower blah x2...</p><p><em>Mistake 3</em>: Moving the Medikit from Medbay whilst Roland was around, which was spotted by him.</p><p>This raised the suspicions of Roland and Raluca tremendously, but they could not act as only about 8 crew members were currently active.</p><p><strong>First Strike</strong><br>All this while Paola was secretly communicating with Kuan Ti. At an opportune moment whilst the Human Wonder Duo were probably doing the Thing at the Bravo Dorm, brave Paola took the cat and intend to say hello to our duo at the Bravo Dorm. What she saw was such an unspeakable perversion of human act (a threesome), that she dropped the cat out of sheer horror. In a rage of Mush, she unintentionally threw the grenade that she was holding. The following epic action ensued.</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Paola's adeptly wielded blade makes a huge gash in Roland. ~2h <br>Roland wakes up calmly... ~2h <br>Janice has been slain by Paola 's blade. ~2h <br> Janice is dead. Cause: Assassinated ~2h <br>Janice's face contorts when Paola removes the blade which they just stuck in them. ~2h <br>Raluca punched Paola but hit their protective clothing. ~2h <br>Knife fights rarely end well, Paola carried out some major health cuts... on Janice. ~2h <br>Raluca punched Paola but hit their protective clothing. ~2h <br>Raluca punched Paola but hit their protective clothing. ~2h <br>Despite a good dodge, Janice has lost a little blood ~2h <br>Raluca punched Paola but hit their protective clothing. ~2h <br>Paola unsheathed their blade and tried to attack Janice but missed the target. ~2h <br>Raluca caught Paola with a majestic uppercut... ~2h <br>Raluca punched Paola but hit their protective clothing. ~2h <br>This is reminiscent of watching fencing lessons. With a lucky strike, Paola perforates Janice's defense with ease. ~2h <br>Raluca tried to punch Paola but missed. ~2h <br>Raluca wakes up calmly... ~2h <br>Knife fights rarely end well, Paola carried out some major health cuts... on Janice. ~2h <br>Paola unsheathed their blade and tried to attack Janice but missed the target. ~2h <br>Knife fights rarely end well, Paola carried out some major health cuts... on Janice. ~2h <br>Raluca is lying down... It's good to just stop and take a break. Destination : the land of dreams! ~2h <br>Paola unsheathed their blade and tried to attack Janice but missed the target. ~2h <br>Raluca has picked up the Schrödinger. ~2h <br>Raluca wakes up calmly... ~2h <br>Despite a good dodge, Janice has lost a little blood ~2h <br>Ploc...poc...poc...pschhhhh...Paola dives for cover while the others are standing around staring into space. Hey, there's a roc... ~2h <br>Paola entered the room ~2h <br>Paola left the room ~2h <br>Paola has dropped the Schrödinger. ~2h <br>Paola entered the room ~2h </span></span></p><p>In the Aftermath, Roland sends out an-all out SOS to all crew members to attack Paola but in vain. Only Chao, Jin Su, Frieda, Ian and Kuan Ti are active. The rest are silent. Each will have an extremely peculiar reaction to this event.</p><p><strong><em>Day 2 AfterMath</em></strong><br><strong>Kuan Ti's reactions</strong><br>As Kuan Ti entered Bravo Dorm finding the remains of Janice plastered on the wall, he raged at the death of an innocent. Unfortunately, this did seem to convince the Human Wonder Duo tag-team. They dared to accuse me of being the second Mush. The conversation as follows:</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Kuan Ti :<br><br>Got dirty attempting to repair stuff. Will bathe once I have enough AP to do so. All out of AP for the moment, so will come active on Day 3, hopefully. TQ!<br>~1d<br><br>Raluca :<br><br>I think you are 2nd MUSH Kuan Ti<br>~1d<br> <br>Kuan Ti :<br>If you want to fling baseless accusations around, fine! I'm done here. Will come back in tomorrow to see whether I'm still alive and can help you out, then.<br>~1d<br> <br>Roland :<br><br>i asked for a tech to dismatle only the shower in alpha dorm , we will have the showr in ravo dorm for taking showers. what i don´t like is that you are kind of stalling when you should have dismantled the alpha dorm shower right when we asked for a tech. also you went to the öab took a bandage and did not work on any research , so i am sure you had enough AP to dismantle the showrr but you didn´t. so either you are a mush stalling or you are a noob who has no clue how to play as a human. making inventory items thread is a noob idea they think it is useful but it is just wasting your AP and MP on something that all 14 humans can get fdone while each one of them is doing his job. so if you are a noob admit you are and start doing what experienced players ask you to do (just go to alpha dorm and dismantle the shower) if not then you my be a mush.<br>~1d<br><br>Kuan Ti :<br>I tried fixing the Patrol Ship that you mentioned, but failed because I couldn't find the DAMN WRENCH! And I'm not sure why it's missing!<br><br>I conserved 1 free tech point because I wanted to dismantle the shower. Which I can do now, but then you guys won't be able to shower! Whatever, I'll come back tomorrow and if you want to murder an innocent whilst there's a Mush running around, please go ahead. And I spent so much effort creating the Inventory Thread for you guys too. Blah!<br>~1d<br></span></span></p><p>Although this did little to allay their suspicions, they had no choice but to leave Kuan Ti alone. He was the only active Technician and having read the Mage Book, Radio Expert, he was also the alternate for Paola.</p><p><strong>Raluca's reactions</strong><br>After committing the Grand Heresy of accusing the Greatest Architect of being a Mush, Raluca was promptly punished for her unforgivable sin as follows:</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">NERON : A-True adjustment : title reassigned. New « NERON Admin » : Finola. ~1d<br>NERON : [Hax?!] Raluca ? … Raluca !! … Filthy undeserving little thing!! [Hax!] Raluca !! [Hax!] WAKE UP don't abandon me without saying anything! You!! [Kzz] Mother... [Hax!] … *Death registered : Raluca, cause « Fatal Depression ». ~1d<br></span></span></p><p><strong>Roland's Reactions</strong><br>This was an experienced Gold Player with the skills of Pilot, Free Shot and Dashing. A powerful killer combo! After escaping from being killed by Paola, he waited patiently to hatch his counter attack. After building up his AP from sleeping and eating, he was planning to come to the Alpha Dorm where Paola and Kuan Ti was sleeping. Would this be the end of Paola and Kuan Ti? Stay tuned for the next exciting episode.</p>

How? By coming to Alpha Dorm to take a nap. To paraphrase his exact words "Hmmm, I'm tired, this would be a nice place to take a nap". And lo and behold, both Mush Paola and Kuan Ti were protected by the Pacifist aura projected by Ian.</p><p><strong>Frieda, the Cunning Old Coot</strong><br>Pretending to be totally innocent, Frieda posted her announcement on the findings of her planet scans without a care in the world. It was as if she didn't even heard of the Mush before! Her announcements in the midst of the Chaos was disconcerting to say the least.</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Frieda :<br><br>Final Results- Sopibon Lumis, 6 West<br><br>2x high temp, intelligent life, forest, 4x oceanic, o2, desert<br><br>If Roland has sprinter skill and goes on expedition, we can cover the whole planet in one expo.<br>~21h<br>NERON : A-True adjustment : title reassigned.

After Kuan Ti left the Alpha Dorm to 'help' the crew, Ian left soon after. Frieda the nasty old Coot came to Alpha Dorm with a full set of AP and the following epic encounter ensued:</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Paola is lying down...

Although his crew pleads for his help to to refuel the engine and move the ship with the arrival of 12 hunters, he refuses. His exact words of posterity as follows:</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Jin Su : well I suppose you should load fuel first and then I come. you got some bloodbath there so I fell myself safer bein' outside with these little cute fighters. Besides I'm out of ap anyway ~10h]</span></span></p><p><strong><em>Day 3</em></strong></p><p><strong>Death of the Roland, Hero Extraordinaire</strong><br>A cat and mouse game begins between Paola and Roland as each tries to attack the other whilst they are sleeping in the opposing dorms. Having gotten the worst of the exchange, Roland cowardly slinks away to the Medbay to rest, only to find Eleesha sleeping and inactive. His decision? Simple:</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Roland is lying down... It's good to just stop and take a break.

At beginning of Day 4, Paola spored her again. Realizing that something was wrong, she wisely rush to the furthest area in the ship, to the Bridge. Unfortunately, Kuan Ti was already on the scooter in hot pursuit and spored her on the Bridge, finally converting her into the Mush Collective! Her final words:</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Paola : <br>Nice surprise attack Freida, but I was well aware you would do that and I don't go down that easily!<br>~9h <br> Frieda : <br>Can't blame an old lady for trying!<br>~7h <br></span></span></p><p><strong>Jin Su, Cowardly Commander Extraordinare</strong><br>Having had enough of hiding on the Patrolship, he finally returned to the Daedalus. He refused our generous offer of a truce to move the ship from the Hunters so we could survive another day. His WORDS OF WISDOM for refusing, are recorded here for posterity for all to see.</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Jin Su: I fell myself safer bein' outside with these little cute fighters<br>~3h <br> Jin Su : <br>indeed. I'm stick with 'pilot' skill while being secretly warned that Kuan Ti is as a second Mush agent. Or did you really think I wasn't able to move ship 'till some1 told me to?<br>~3h <br>Kuan Ti : <br>Jin Su - As you are aware, we have assumed control of the ship. Kindly report the amount of AP and MP you have currently. We require you to move the ship for our mutual survival. Are you able to refuel the ship by 1 unit via the Rear Alpha Storage to the Engine Room and then all the way back to the Bridge with 1AP to spare?<br>~4h <br>Show all 3 replies. <br> Jin Su : <br><strong><em>I'm touched, really...

The ship was left with 3 Mush - Paola, Kuan Ti and Frieda. The only human was Jin Su. Fittingly we all went out in blaze of glory as the ships was blasted to bits.<br><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><br>NERON : Death registered : Frieda, cause : « Daedalus destroyed ». 9min <br><br>NERON : [Hax!] Haha...

                <p>LOL - I never suspected you, Kuan Ti. Obviously we all knew Paola was mush. (I was Frieda, btw)</p><p>For the record, my run to the bridge had nothing to do with getting away from anyone and everything to do with "oh shit the ship's going down in the next cycle - go get some more glory with the few AP I have!"</p><p>There's nothing Mush can do with Frieda's announcements of planets and the whole crew should a) have input on where they go and b) know that they're going. The worst you could have done (and many mush HAVE done) is change the fuel levels and fuck up the destination.</p><p>I'll admit that the first few days of this ship were disheartening with Paola attacking and killing everyone under the sun and no one doing the first thing about it. (Seriously Jin Su? You couldn't even land to attack her? <strong>COWARD</strong>) It didn't help that I was mostly afk for holiday/family stuff so wasn't as active as I like to be to try to rally the troops.</p><p>On day 3, I kept hoping that Paola would get sick of me trying to attack her and come after me. Not that I tried to make it easy, but I wanted sweet release from this ship. Then she and Kuan Ti turned me and I was suddenly bummed at how fast we were going to die! I wasn't going to be home from Mom's after Christmas dinner to enjoy the mushiness!</p><p>It's really too bad we went down so fast.. but Paola's comments after each death were absolutely priceless!</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">NERON<br>Death registered : Finola, cause : « Fatal Depression ».<br>Paola<br>You see?

If I had the two spores still with me and we had done the thing, we would have turned you into the Mush sooner.</p><p>We wanted to kill Jin Su fast and convert you into the Mush so that you could move the ship. Yep, Jin Su was so scared that he went of patrolling almost the whole of Day 3. Read his comments about MushRaped, hilarious <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Yeah, Paola's comments after each deaths were great. Sort of an eulogy for them. I was hoping she could come here to post them as my posts were getting too long. Thanks for posting them here for completion sake. Guess you were really busy during Christmas!</p>

                <p>Well, Ian really helped us out during the critical period there. We had a good R&amp;R session with him protecting us! I see that you're quite an experienced player.
