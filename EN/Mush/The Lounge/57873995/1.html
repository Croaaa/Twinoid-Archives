                <p>This ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/10777" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/10777</a></p><p>Have you ever reached the point in your game that Eleesha declares the ship mush free, both mush are dead, and suddenly the doubt hits you...<br>"What if Eleesha is Mush?"<br>Ever saw your fellow crewmembers disassembling cameras and thought to yourself:<br>"Wow, if I were mush here, I would have a BLAST"?<br>Well...</p><p>On joining the ship, I saw we had a very good Chun. Brutally efficient, she ran a tight ship. All weapons hidden, logs collected, events scrutinized... every mush's worst nightmare. Well, except that she did not have Lethargy or Dodge, but hey, sure beats a vegetable in the lab. The rest of the ship? Umm...</p><p>Lets see.<br>We had Toxic Su, who spent most of his time screaming at everyone on the ship about how nothing was done by D2 (When he woke up) and how useless we were. Oh, with specific hatred turned towards poor Poala for not doing comms fast enough.<br>We had Unintelligible Ti who spoke in monkey sounds and tried to get in Raluca's pants (or something??). All I know is that there was biting involved.<br>We had Chaos Agent Ian who ran around the ship, stealing random items and generally being unpredictable.</p><p>We started well, research a bit slow, but Chun quickly found the mush sample and I camped the lab, relaying everything that entered. Research wasn't super quick, as Raluca and KT preferred to get PS done instead, but we got the basics done around a day after mush selection. All in all, within reasonable tolerances. After research was done, I started my mush-hunting in earnest, collecting logs and checking suspects. Since Chun was keeping an eye on Bravo Dorm, I took up station in Alpha Dorm. During this time, a mixup between Chun, Jin Su and Paola resulted in us losing the D3 base and the yummy AP that came from that. Oh well.</p><p>I had barely gotten comfy there, still watching occasionally, when the next thing I see is a little window that says "Welcome to Mush!". Seems I had started with a spore and Roland had taken the opportunity to deface the dorm and convert me. To make things even better, he had not picked anonymush yet, leaving it to me! Ballsy, but it paid off. I picked it and nobody saw a thing. At the exact moment this happened, there were exactly 3 people in the dorm: Me, Roland and Inactive Terrence. So my first words as a new mush were "Well. Now you gotta get away with that little move." Boy oh boy did we get away with it.</p><p>Hua had gotten herself stranded in space and wouldn't be back until morning. KT was busy relaying/biting/doing certain other dodgy moves with Raluca in Nexus (under a camera, we had paranoid, Coffeemancer Gioele) and when he came back the same cycle that the defaced happened, he noticed nothing. I cannot stress enough how much of a crucial moment this was. Two people had a chance to spot the deface (and a few more in subsequent cycles, but that was understandably harder to see) and neither noticed. This allowed me to get away with being mush completely. Of course it was only a matter of time until Chun came in to see what was going on here and then the game would be up! Therefore Roland volunteered to rampage and remove her from the board.</p><p>His initial plan was to get a blaster and kill Chun. Who had armor. Note we had no lenses. So his odds of that succeeding were... low. However, what we also had was an inactive Derek in the lab! Tracking Chun's movements via the logs I collected I also managed to narrow down the locations of where the weapons were hidden and I could point Roland to only a few rooms to search. Plan made, Roland found himself a blaster, defaced BD (to sow confusion) and went and fetched himself a Derek suit. Turns out, Derek was still IN THE TUTORIAL! That means we didnt get the 12 AP we had wanted, but just 8 AP instead. We wanted to kill Raluca as a secondary target (she had genius and we were afraid of an instant cure/mush chat thingy) but he did not have enough AP. Chun died with nary a whimper to Derek's fists under the deface and Derek went to hide under CHAOS AGENT IAN who was busy opening a hellgate in FC. I think.</p><p>More next time! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":tid_smile:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>At this point the confusion of the deface really kicked in. Janice was in the room when the deface happened and screamed about Roland being mush upon his first deface, but then proceeded to run around like a headless chicken looking for weapons (while Chun had hidden them all). The result? She looked suspicious as hell, despite making the alarm. Of course, we had not counted on Chaos Agent Ian! While my friend in his Derek-Suit was sleeping peacefully, Chaos Agent Ian finished his preperations in FC and scooted up to the bridge where he began trying to seduce Paola into his wicked ways with some canny and irresistable flirting. This left poor Derek without the dubious protection of his dark sorceries. I took the opportunity to go punch him a few times until I hit his armor. What I didnt realize was that Derek had been starving and he was down to 6 hp. My punches took out 3 <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This of course made me dirty and gave me a perfect excuse to extract some spores and make my home in BD. Gioele finished Derek off a little later (sadly) but the damage had been done. Stephen, apparently confused by what had happened, proceeded to kill Roland's old body (since Janice had screamed that it was mush) and then apparently convinced Janice had lied to him, tried to kill her too. He ran out of AP.</p><p>With the mush dead, everyone was tense. A second rampage was likely (haha). Nobody really did much except gather up AP to weather the coming storm. Or perhaps my crew was just horribly inactive. Either way, not much happened for a while. Stephen was a prime suspect (I gently steered the humans to him) except that he had gotten a psychological illness when Chun died. However, he could still have been converted AFTER that so he wasnt quite in the clear. We discussed what to do with him, but Hua interceded and convinced us not to kill him.</p><p>And then Stephen finished the job on Janice, right after she cured him. After which he promptly ate a pill and 2 bananas (I think). So now he was confirmed human, despite murdering our only source of morale on the ship (besides Toxic Su's leadership, which he never used, since that would be too much like helping his team instead of flaming them for being noobs and why are the mush not dead yet you all suck). Hmm. Even Hua was tempted to kill Stephen at this point, but we couldn't get a proper hitsquad together. Gioele had the knife and was not active at the time, and Stephen was the only person with Shooter on the ship.</p><p>Eventually, we decided not to kill him since he actually did have a valid point. Janice WAS present when the deface happened. She could have been converted or even have been another mush. Some communication would have been nice but... oh well. Not like he was the LEAST communicative person on the ship. Everyone had forgotten about Dark Agent Ian, who suddenly realized that he had plants he needed to have taken care of as they were crucial to his dark designs and shouted at us for having ruined them (after having neglected them for 3 days to prepare his evil summoning). Apparently angry at us for having let some of his precious plants die, he changed tack, instead taking from us what we love as well. He stormed into Bravo Dorm and threw down the fire extinguisher (the one Chun had hidden that he had found), most likely after emptying its contents drawing horrid, mind-wrenching runes on the walls, and grabbed the medkit. And the blaster. After which he promply lay down and went to sleep. What foul purpose he had in mind for them we could only imagine in our darkest dreams...</p><p>Oxygen was startin to run low and Frieda was having no luck with the scanning, the only planet with oxygen she had found also having a nice little seismic event on. Out of pure desperation (and because this ship was being too much fun to let it die of something so stupid as lack of oxygen) I scanned us an oxygen planet! Mostly. I was tempted to lie, tempted to remove the oxygen, add some dangers... in the end I settled for not finishing the scan and went back to bed. I specifically TOLD everyone that was what I was doing and I would finish it that evening... but they couldn't wait. Off they went, right to my partially finished planet with oxygen and cristallis. Only to discover the planet also had VOLCANOES. Fun!</p><p>Not that that stopped Toxic Su and Inactive Andie. Grouping up, they took the risk going down as only 2 people (one of them just launched, I dunno)... where they proceeded to have a lovely stroll, picking up a nice, shiny starmap fragment, some oxygen, and waving at the volcano as they strolled past, suffering no more than some minor cuts and bruises along the whole thing.</p><p>More next time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":tid_smile:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Unfortunately, this was the exact herald of the end times that Ian's Chaotic benefactors had been waiting for. His dark plan was coming closer to fruition and we realized we had to do something. If we did nothing... we would all die. Human, Mush, we all stood up together as one, screaming defiance at the coming darkness! Never before has mush and human taken hands (unknowingly for the human, fair enough, but that in no way reduced the sense of comradery on both sides) and said "NO MORE FOUL DARKNESS! YOU. SHALL. NOT. PASS!"</p><p>And yet... Ian's power of lethargy was too strong. The entire ship was in its grip. Nobody could move. Nobody could wake up. Our rage was not enough... except for one man. One light in the darkness stood up. He gathered all our combined rage, all our hopes and dreams and he stepped forward to face this undefeatable monster. Gioele. The man. The legend.</p><p>He dove into Bravo Dorm like a chubby Bruce Lee, whipping out the knife and in one smooth movement struck out at Ian... and discovered that in his roll he had gotten turned around and stabbed at thin air. He spun around to stab Ian again... but in the process lost his grip on his knife, sending it flying out of his hands to where it nearly took my hair off and clattered against the wall. Quickly, before Ian could realize what had happened, he waddled over and after straining a bit, managed to get his knife back in hand. With a flourish he stabbed at where Ian had been moments before... but Ian, ever the canny Chaos Agent had moved over to the wall to fix where someone had drawn a penis over one of his eldritch, mind-rending symbols to Cthulu. Now even Gioele, glorious fighter of hope and humanity that he was, started to feel the effects of Ian's lethargy. His coffee... had become heavy. His trackie... had become heavy. His ration... had become heavy. So he ate it. His knife... had new purpose. Given strength by the food... he screamed in rage and lunged at the smug, deranged looking Ian...</p><p>His knife went deep. Very deep. It plunged right into Ian's vile heart and with a look of shock on his face... Ian died. Right there. In a single blow. We were saved.</p><p>Well. For a given value of 'saved' considering there were still 2 mush on board the ship, one of them completely hidden. Luckily for the humans, Andie had been hard at work on his secret project: Mycoalarms! It was 95% complete and a single relay from finished. Then all the insecure spaces aboard the ship could be properly protected against the mush menace!</p><p>What could a poor mush do but take advantage of this? I sauntered up to the lab, completed the alarms and was the helpful mushy who delivered one to medlab, now having the perfect excuse to go in there. Kuan Ti had at some point been thoroughly rejected by Raluca (maybe he didnt bite hard enough?) and was draining his sorrows in Andie's lap in medlab, possibly trying to score some sympathy tail. I had spiked the cat earlier and Kuan Ti had been the lucky recipient of that spore, putting him at... 1. Good thing I was a lvl 14 mush. I sidled into medlab, quickly converted KT, had Paola pick anonymush and dropped the Mycoalarm. Smooth. And then there were 3 mush again.</p><p>At this point I did something stupid. I tried to MANIPULATE my own teammate (KT) into getting himself killed, knowing that if he dies, all mush are hidden and I can simply proclaim the ship mush free. Unfortunately, he did far better than I anticipated. He removed the camera in the nexus and spored Raluca as I told him to... but then reacted when she spotted him and transferred into her body before killing his old one. He smoothtalked his way out of it when, listen to this, HUA came to his defence.</p><p>"No look, I know KT turned out to be human, but I am sure he was just noob. That is why he removed the camera." The fact that Raluca was now suddenly hiding in the rear turrets did not seem to arouse suspicion from the crew... who looked at ME to tell them what to do (as far as they were active at all). Now I was stuck in a bind. I knew the old Raluca had been gold, new one was bronze. His speaking had subtly changed and lets face it... this was obvious as FUCK. And yet I would have to be the one to proclaim him mush or nobody else would. And yet if I covered for him, I would put myself in a STUPID risk. Doing nothing was no option, ship would die at that rate. I had to do something.</p><p>After stalling for a day or so, I finally came clean to my new mushy friend and apologized deeply for what I had done, at the same time congratulating him on far exceeding my expectations. I mean, it sucked that Raluca died, I would have loved to convert her, but it did technically screw the humans over as they only had 1 tech now (Hua). In the end, I decided to discover and kill the new mushy, after leaving him a nice message. I do hope if you are reading this you will forgive me.</p><p>I grabbed the knife (Gioele had been convinced to leave it for us) and headed back to "check" on Raluca's skills. I made the alarm, Stephen grabbed a blaster and came to help, and I took the opportunity to spike him once (all conversion would have to happen through trapping now, but prep work could still be done manually). Raluca died and I rushed to the bridge and giggled to myself as I proclaimed the ship mush free.</p><p>More next time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":tid_smile:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>The next day dawned with people suddenly realizing that the combination of a lack of Janice and Chun was having a rather punishing effect on their morale. Paola had already gotten us BOTH morale bases, but all that had already been burnt through. There was some complaining and cat hugging, but regardless I could see that for this ship the writing was on the wall. How would anyone be able to coordinate enough to Do The Thing when people are online for at most 5 minutes?</p><p>Luckily, Frieda had found us the most GORGEOUSLY beautiful planet, with oxygen, fuel, crystals, a shipwreck and none of the 'Deadly Three' (Seismic, Volcanoes and Mankarog). Frankly, if Eden was off the table I would have settled there instead. Maybe take the Daedalus apart and build myself a little cottage by the seaside, slowly work on converting all the natural fauna and flora to mush... ahem! Anyway. With our last mush dead (haha) and morale plummeting, we managed to finish Pilgred after I picked tech strategically when it was almost done so that I wouldn't be asked to eat to finish it. Hua did all the grunt work. Now, our only shot at Eden was to hit that planet for two starmap pieces! Hey, it has happened!</p><p>This game was the first one where I have seen a human remove the BD camera for a mush. A dirty mush, I might add. In desperation, Stephen removed the BD camera so we can have some fun later, but we never got around to it. In desperation to keep the ship going a little longer and buoy the humans spirits, I even revealed the Shrink book that I had hidden AGES ago when it seemed morale was going to be a thing (it had been our starting skillbook <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ). Yep, nobody had remembered that we had one after I updated astropad not to show it. Stephen read the book and went to do his shrink thing... but of Inactive Andie there was no sign. He was comfortably snoozing in medlab, forcing the rest of us to use Bravo Dorm if we wanted to do any horizontal gymnastics.</p><p>In the end, we never did do the expo. Without Andie's diplomacy it would have been dangerous as hell, and although I was active, I simply did not have enough AP to do all the things that needed to be done (white flag built, plants taken care of, expo launched, etc) and despite pleading and begging, nobody else stuck around long enough for even a conversation (except Paola and Stephen right at the end). In the end, Gioele took us home after nobody but Frieda could even be active enough to vote on whether we should go home or not (she voted against, Gioele voted for and I was my usual vague self so that my arse is covered either way).</p><p>And what happens next, is another story...</p><p>All in all, this ship reached the golden zone where mush could act freely... but could not keep the ship itself alive against its own nature. If we had just remained hidden, the ship would have died. No humans had any interest in the mush hunt, preferring to leave it all to me. But at the same time, none of them were active enough to be able to be converted (they would have to pick anonymush when we convert again and I didnt trust them to be sufficiently active).</p><p>My endgame human skills - Tracker, IT expert, Observant, Tech. The last two were only picked at the end.<br>My endgame mush skills - Anonymush, Fertile, Infector. Yep, never picked a fourth and finished without picking splashproof. I simply took the burn. I used both bandages in medlab and sneakily self-healed once, as well as asked the crew to heal me once later on.</p><p>Thanks for reading! If you were from this ship, feel free to add your own thoughts!</p>

                <p>An excellent writeup indeed. Not on this ship, but it was an enjoyable read <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Gotta hate when conitions are right for something truly amazing to happen, but then the ship RNG blows up in your face. Still, it was a solid win for the Mush!</p>
