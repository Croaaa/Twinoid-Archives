There had been so many people waltzing through Bravo Dorm it was almost impossible for myself and Chao to keep up.

                <p>So first, a bit of backstory. The ship before this, Peanutz talked me into joining because our choices matched. She was human Chao, I rolled mush Stephen. Had a partner on that ship for whom only conversion was an option, and conversion without sacrifice. It was a very organized ship with Peanutz Chao and I didn't think that was possible, so I decided to sacrifice myself and take out Chao and Eleesha, so that my partner could try things their way.</p><p>So, Peanutz and I were dead again, and once again, our choices matched. I was iffy on joining a new ship, but pass up a chance for Peanutz ship? Naw. So jumped, once again Peanutz was human Chao and I was mush, this time Janice. Only this time, the crew wasn't quite as organized and my partner was Noted Jin Su.</p><br><p>For those who haven't shipped with me, I'm an avid RP'er and somewhat of an amateur writer. Each of my characters have a backstory and motivation. I do my best to make them complete people. For this ship, I decided to revive an old Janice from a ship that died very quickly prior - among other things, she has a daughter back on Sol, who has been mushed. She's very driven to find the cure and get back to her kiddo. Only this time, I rolled mush, so she had a very different motivation there. It was a lot of fun playing with this personna. :3</p><p>But anyways! Jin and I knew that we had to get Chao. But how? Jin placed a couple of traps, Terrence picked one up. We largely laid low and I worked on the mush hunt, got myself fairly trusted. Made a list of probability of each person being mush, with Jin somewhere in the middle. Really pushed at Eleesha, Hua and I think Gioele, if I remember correctly. In the meantime, Chao got twitchier and twitchier at a lack of obvious suspects. When he asked me if we should print the list, with 5 names on it, I went with yes. But then.... Eleesha went idle at very much the wrong time. Eleesha was a high level suspect - what if she was stalling and discussing things, what if she was going to rampage? Enough groundwork was laid... It really didn't take much if any pushing at that point for Eleesha to die - mostly just held his hand and waited for him to do it. Better yet, he got sick from killing her, so known human. Perfect convert target.</p><p>Jin and I were sitting pretty good, but time is not on a mush's side. I suggested a high risk plan to convert Chao that thankfully we didn't end up needing to do. Instead, Chao went idle in a turret. Welp. Clearly, time to convert. Jin went in and stuck a spore. I went in and stuck the other two, then immediately started PM'ing a known human (Stephen) about having seen Jin in there and 'oh no what if Chao was converted!?' Then followed it up with Jin claiming it was to check and see if anyone had been in there, since it had been a couple of hours. Chao had told me in private that he wasn't actually out of AP, that he had 3 but 0 MP and he didn't want to convert. Since the crew was assuming he idled there because he was completely out, I had a plan for him to eat a ration and show he'd gotten energy from it and was still human, thereby clearing both Jin and I when he used the mycoscanner and said 0 spores..... but.... he ate without the apron before he saw my message, and got dirty. So we ended up sacrificing Jin with his permission &lt;/3, and stalling the humans regarding the second mush (they still had several targets, thanks to Chao being the hunt leader and his management of things).</p><p>The making of the cure was hilariously slow. Our main research pushers weren't online at the same time as others, Finola wasn't around enough for relays, etc. I put priority to research and pushed it as much as I could. XD Chao told the humans that since I was a suspect, he had me thinking they were going to cure someone else, so it wasn't a danger for me to work on it as long as I didn't finish it. When it was finally done, he 'decided' to torture me, found his proof and 'cured' me. Of course, we coordinated so that I was online to run away to the Neuxs to 'try to flee' given NERON admin and all that... and be away from eyes who would be able see the lack of skill reset. So it was done, and I put on a <a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/a/rTzK7">performance for the crew</a> which I was pretty pleased with.</p><p>And... they bought it. There were holes, sure, and Chao was half convinced that everything we did would scream that we were mush. I linked him to this song a few times <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bESGLojNYSo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bESGL...</a> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And, we were careful to seem human. We probably could have stuck around and converted after found the third star map piece, but it mostly amounted to deciding that the crew had played as human and should end as human, and get a nice surprise on their endpage. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So yeah, lots of fun! I really enjoyed RP'ing a mush couple with Peanutz. :3 Oh the discussions we had. And we made a mush baby! But Peanutz, you KNOW, Janice was totally piiiisssssseeeeed at those last words/actions. He anticipated HER actions and circumvented them! XD S'cool, I'm sure she'll get over it especially when they're successful.</p>

                <p>Goood morning. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So... this was a fun ship to play, although, as Rainy said, it made me quite twitchy at some points. The mush-hunting part was a bit frustrating, with either too many suspects (lots of people who got dirty or went through BD, plus those who could be laying low because they had no reason to be dirty) or not enough (everybody was doing their job, everybody got hungry at the right time, no real suspicious behaviour). I was stuck in the lab helping rush mycoalarms in the first days, which made it impossible for me to watch BD closely enough, and the reports I got from Eleesha were a little too vague for my liking. At least at first. Which eventually led to her murder, encouraged by Janice (hrmf, you evil manipulator)... and she turned out human.</p><p>And then, I had to idle in that turret and be afk for a little less than an hour. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Sure enough, when I came back, I had been visited by three people... and I was mush. We quickly decided that it had been too obvious and that we needed to sacrifice one of us, so I tortured Jin Su and he was killed. Now was the tricky part, because I had to lead them to suspect Janice and eventually to "cure" her, but I had to leave enough doubts to avoid someone running to stick her with the serum immediately. There were quite a few confirmed humans at that point, so I narrowed the list of "suspects" to Janice and Gioele, using the fact that the second spore could have come from a trap (since Jin Su had been able to transfer to Terrence without spiking him, it meant that there could be spores around the ship, and Gioele could have done that). I also somehow managed to convince them that we should ask Janice to set priority to research and "use" her to rush RFS while we would tell her that we wanted to cure Gioele. As she said, it took almost a day to finish it, which was quite stressful, because the timing had to be perfect. We both had to be online, to make sure that nobody else grabbed the cure, that Janice could pretend to flee, and that nobody saw that she didn't lose her skills. I actually snatched the bottle right under Chun's nose, who was online at the exact moment we finished the serum. I fully expected it to backfire, and yet... it worked. We both went underground, patiently - well, more or less patiently - waiting for the three starmaps, the last two being found on the same giant planet complete with a big scary Mankarog.</p><p>And there we are, settling on Eden with our mush cat, and expecting the first Eden baby - the first Eden <em>Mush</em> baby.</p><br><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_8370521 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8370521">krihypha</span> : I couldn't have been mush if Janice had really become human again. A mush couldn't have cured his partner for real, and a cured mush couldn't flatly lie and say that the ship was mush free. That was our main concern in the last days, actually. If one of us died or was exposed, the other one would be revealed too.</p><br><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_8797719 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8797719">pyro__maniac</span> : I got rid of the serum almost immediately, I was too scared of curing Janice accidentally. I believe I stuck it into Raluca's... arm, when Janice and I ran into the Nexus while she was pretending to escape. (Using RFS is completely invisible to everyone, including to the person who injects it <em>and</em> to the person who receives it if they're human. Only cured mush have a special message in their logs, the one that Janice copied in her RP "confession".)</p><br><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_25055 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="25055">groomsh</span> : Hey, Granny. So that was you ? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Yeah, it <em>was</em> easier than it should have been. Janice actually said that she had Infector, which meant that she and Jin Su could have been able to spike me three times (which they in fact did). And yet the lab people let the potential beta grab the cure and use it himself without batting an eyelid. There was no reaction either when I immediately asked permission to stay dirty, when Janice helped Raluca rush Pilgred, when she kept research locked even after projects were completed. Nobody even considered doing pheromodem. And nobody found it suspicious that Janice and I avoided most expos, asking Stephen to apprentice Diplomat to avoid the risk of illnesses. I stood on the bridge during expos, whistling and thinking that it could have been so easy to abandon the unsuspecting team if our plan hadn't been to infect Eden.</p><br><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_1268679 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1268679">Rain</span> : Oh, I knew that Janice was going to be pissed that I forced her to go to Eden instead of going back to Sol to save her daughter. But I'm sure that Chao will find a way to be forgiven. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I had such fun roleplaying with you, first as the human chief of security suffering from a pathetic fear of animals, then in public as the commander who was furious to have been manipulated by his therapist, while in private Janice taught him what it meant to be mush and they finally admitted their mutual love. It's really more fun when you convert me instead of killing me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> ♥</p>

                <p>Aww Flash, thanks, but I'm sure others have managed.</p><p>Peanutz: It's like Janice told Chao - people see what they expect to see. Sure, there were holes in the logic, there were things to suspect, but if people bought the initial story, it would take big things to throw up red flags at that point, because they're seeing things through the lens of mush free ship and time to try for Eden.</p><p>Groomsh: Awww.... I really wanted to do some RP with Frieda. I was actually pretty cool with the idea of continuing the ship a bit to maybe convert you, or at least chat with you more! But that would have been a silly risk.</p><p>Pyro: Pheromodem was definitely the big part of the reason. Phero wasn't a huge risk for us at that point, UNLESS Chao or Jan went on an expedition that got mush trapped. But there was a human reason for locking research, and a good one - we didn't need our more random players pushing research when there was Eden to find, people to heal, fires, etc. I'd have switched it if anyone asked me to. Was pretty fine with the fact that no one did, to be sure. I'm actually against pheromodem regardless of which side I'm on. A good hunter (granted, you don't always have one of these) can use pheromodem to find any mush that does a mushy thing no matter how sneaky they are, or simply wait and use process of elimination if they do nothing. So the only option is rampage. Which... Jin and I could have rampaged this ship, easily - very vulnerable to tech rampage, then pilots with leftover AP. But that wouldn't have been fun for anyone.</p>

She didn't do any mush hunting of her own, but she was active in the lab and helpful with ship security (mycoalarms, hacker kit, pilot book...). She was even online at the exact moment RFS was completed, and I was really scared she would pick it up before me. I literally ran out of medlab with the vial. But I had laid down my excuse before starting RFS, by telling you that Janice wouldn't want to be cured and might try to sabotage it by using it on someone else. Or that she could rampage, transfer, take off, when I started torturing her, so I had to be able to "cure" her as soon as I got proof.</p><br><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_1268679 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1268679">Rain</span> : I know, but I saw things the way I would have seen them if I had been human, and I couldn't believe that it had worked so smoothly.

                <p>Grats on win! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":tid_happy:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I was Paola on this ship. I had a feeling things were too good to be true with how things were going, but I been pretty busy this week with work to notice. Only my second ship though so I'm not sure how much I would have been able to catch, you guys were theory crafting hardcore haha. Was a great play though. I wish I could have been more active in the hunt since we had such a good crew this game.</p><p>Also for Rain and the others who were RPing you guys were great!</p><p>I hope to have more ships like this in the future, lots of fun.</p>
