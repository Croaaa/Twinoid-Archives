                <p>Hello!, Amateur comedian Roland here!</p><p>A ship without a Chun nor an Eleesha, This should be fun, I thought at auto-selection, and it was!</p><p><strong>The mush hunt</strong></p><p>Firstly, We had a "mini-griefer" on board, Gioele, who killed Finola, the most active member on the ship, and the one who helped push out investigations, because she "treated him badly". We killed him and, Guess What, Human.<br>Our next suspect was Stephen, who passed through Medbay with Raluca sleeping on it, I killed him, and guess what, Human. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"><br>Next Suspect, Kuan Ti, who got killed by Chao, <strong>He was mush</strong><br>Next suspect, Hua, she had reported nothing during the ship, not recollection of scraps or shutting down hunters, Chao killed her, and she was human <em>This is starting to become a trend, isn't it?</em><br>Next up, after making the pheromodem, we discovered the last mush was Ian, who, after kmnowing he was ousted, rampaged and killed Chao and Frieda by mutating, I went to save the day, and shot him twice and killed him using my bare hands. Which left us with 6 crew.</p><p><strong>Among the hardest survival</strong></p><p>We were 6 survivors, Me, Jin Su, who was a pilot, Janice, Diplomat and Shirnk, Paola, only comms expert, Terrence, Robotics Expert.<br>Paola died due to injuries, sadly.<br>We began repairing PILGRED, at the beggining, progress was very slow, we couldn't get togheter to work on it, Janice, Raluca and Me got it up to 66%, and Jin and Ralu finished it!<br>We were very lucky, since no huge waves of hunters came to destroy us with just 2 pilots.<br>Oh, I also... pulled some moves on Raluca <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Thanks to Raluca, for being the last tech and helping push out PILGRED<br>Thanks to Janice, for being our shirnk, healer and subsistute reasercher<br>Thanks to Jin Su, for being my pilot companion and a good commander!<br>Thanks to Chao, for being a good mush-hunter<br>Thanks to Finola, though dying early because of a Griefer, you were instrumental to limitting the mush's capabilities.<br>And thanks and congratulations for Terrence on that nova, for discovering planets, though you were a little inactive in the last 2 days, you still helped with planets and fixing stuff when us pilots couldn't go.<br>Anyways, An awesome ship despite the hardships.
