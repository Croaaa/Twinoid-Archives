                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1875">End page.</a><br>Phew. An MMM ship. Possibly the longest voyage with ending day 22.<br>What can I say apart from the praises? We got the mush quickly, the second one even turned back to human (only to go afk and starve...). After that it was a race against the RNG and..oh boy.</p><p>I was Eleesha on this ship. You know, the character I posted about being boring and uninteresthing a few days before this ship? After refreshing for 3 minutes and already being late for the MMM Jump, i was "ehh eff it" and spent XP to make her reliable. I'm guessing that on any other character it would have been different for me. Still, nothing can compare to my Golden hair!</p><p><em>*Khm-khm.* </em><br>Look at the end screen. Now look back here. I'm riding a rolling boulder with LOADS OF ALIEN BOTTLE OPENERS! Now look back at you. Is that a water pill in your hand? Well we even figured out how to use that!<br>Seriously, we had the bum sector of space, with drunkards everywhere. Bottle openers, boulders and lots of drunk alien life wanting to fight us, until Janice's diplomat got effective. Fortunately we found nice planets, no volcano spam or things like that.</p><p>The funny thing is...after getting every research, every project (kudos to Paola and her quick upgrades), it actually became boring (for me at least). Not much to do apart from being an Eleesha on a mush free ship, doing stuff sub optimally. At the end of it, we got into the ritual of "extinguish-heal-check other people-repeat", with not much challenge there apart from either having enough AP or not. It wasn't interesthing as we did EVERYTHING and simply...we weren't lucky enough. With mush dead early, people active and doing their jobs to great effect, it was simple, pure, dumb luck on whenever we get a star map or not. Number of expeditions is 26, and we gained one star map..and twice mush trap maybe? Once at least.<br>Also the dark side of Twinoid, horrid and laggy chat system, even on day 19, as I scrolled to find an unread part, I suddenly saw the "Hello"-s from the first day. Then crashing almost and being laggy, as we were around v7 of the Health Thread. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> So far it wasn't annyoing for me, but on this ship I suddenly realised what people on the forums argued about.</p><p>Since this ship was filled with forum active people, I'll let them speak here. Also it's like 2am here and I'm sleepy as hell, even though I wanted to write an epic saga about it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Ian and Chao got killed by RNG even though they were carefull, they deserve mentioning.</p><p>The most..perplexing person was Jin Su. Barely active as a captain (I even raged in the forums about it), not doing much and still upholding his attitude AFTER WE CURED HIM OF MUSHINESS. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Still, he gave me a week of golden days after I said that I'll have no skills to use it for great effect, and I think he may gifted some other person too. Then went afk and died slowly. <em>Ijustdontevenknow.jpg</em></p><p>I'll get out and sleep now, and gg everyone, it was fun and something special. 22 days of relying on each other is..unique. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><strong>Edit:</strong> oh and I almost forgot: Finola and Roland, two people whom are probably not forum goes, they deserve mention for doing their best, even though they got killed soon. (Or killed. <em>Cough. Cough</em>.) I would mention Terrence but...he simply behaved badly, so naaaah. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>EDIT 2!</strong> I just have to point out that our ship has (according to the rankings on this server) the biggest glories! Janice being the top 1 in this server, our Hua the 3rd, and I'm 9th..even though I barely shot any hunters, nor did my passive glory gained much. Next Eleesha in the rankings is 26th, hehe. Also almost all of us are in the top! WOOOHOOO!<img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/loc/fr/notes/Omg.png" alt=":teacher_hsherlock_1a:" class="tid_img tid_parsed" style=""></p>

                <p>I was the Stephen of this ship. I <strong>LOVED</strong> it. The crew was HYPER active, to a scary degree. I was the 2nd to log in and the first thing I did was make the usual threads ot Inventory, health, etc... Who'd THINK that they'd get filled up so quickly and so much that we'd have a SEVENTH health thread to avoid lag? Honestly... As Eleesha mentioned, we were unlucky with Star fragments, but still, we gathered a good collection:</p><ul><li>5 Alien Openers</li><li>4 Circuit Jellies</li><li>3 Water Sticks</li><li>2 Boulders</li><li>2 Shells</li><li>2 Liquid Maps</li><li>1 Alien TV<br> <br>I learned a LOT during this trip, and I truly wish to have half of the people of this voyage in a casting, if possible, when the function is implemented. Ian's hard work at analizing the expedition gains inspired me to create my Excel Analizer Sheet (Shameless promotion). Chao was a Hyperactive fool with a heart of gold... Really great crew, a darn shame those two died so early. And we TRULY wanted to reach Eden, but it was getting too hard, we were sacrificing sleep to keep going... Maybe better luck next time! I heard the French record is Day 24. What say we beat that next time?</li></ul>

                <p>It was a glorious battle, after a long investigation....nope.</p><p>I don't think Jin Su even did anything mushy. He was barely active as we nagged him to commander the ship (which may have been a valid delaying tactic), but he obeyed as Chao flailed his gun around. He didn't really contribute much to the mush team. Same with Raluca, but at least she tried.<br>The simply answer is: The cat. After finishing mycoscan I announced to try and pet the cat, which Ian did moments before me, saying that it is trapped. Being an MMM paranoid ship, NOBODY, and I do mean NOBODY used the cat and it was picked up only once. By Raluca. Hmm. If I remember correctly, room logs just barely went into past cycles enough to see this action, and from there she was good as dead.</p><p>As Raluca said on the end game, we were active. A lot. Someone went into engine room? Questions and gun pointed to head as maybe spiking occured. I as Eleesha went there to check up, I messaged and announced first. Funny thing is, there was some miscommunication between the two mush, as Jin Su got caught for going into the engine room "to relay the pilgred", which Raluca didn't ask...but later remembered "she may have said something like that", pointing more fingers to Jin Su. If it wasn't for the cat, Raluca wouldn't even been a suspect. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>hey guys, Kuan Ti here</p><p>This was a fantastic trip, after so many ships where I had to struggle with over half of the ship being inactive I felt so refreshed <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Definitely joining next MMM and a week break will do me some good. The ship was awesome but also tiring, because seeing so many active people made me want to be even more active. I bet most of us did some sacrifices because of it, I for one slept less (stayed up longer) but it was well worth it and would repeat it anytime! Especially with a good crew.</p><p>About the trip... Well even though we tried our best the star maps just weren't coming but I suppose that is how Twinoid makes their games, try harder, spend money and maybe RNG will finally like you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br>I feel a bit better that no other ship reached Eden (sorry for that other ships, it's just how I am!) because then I would be even more annoyed with RNG. We will get there next time!</p>

                <p>Janice here, I apologize for the wall of text in advance, but when you hear <em>let's not take the babel moduele, we want steaks</em> you'll know this ship is <strong>SPECIAL</strong></p><p>Day 1 Joined a few minutes late wondering if I managed to catch an MMM. One look at the 100+ messages I had to read answered any questions I had pretty quickly. Things went smoothly, even though I was super paranoid at first since <strong>Janice</strong> is a good mush target if you want to mess with a team, especially with a mushy <strong>Jin Su</strong>.</p><p>Our first attempt at mush hunting was hastily ganging up on newbie <strong>Roland</strong> who was just just doing newbie things.. I feel sorry to this day, he seemed eager to learn but we just thought he was "playing newbie" as a strategy.</p><p>Days went on, we caught the mush, cured <strong>Jin Su</strong> because he really kept pressing the serum subject and we thought he would be a great addition to the team if he was that interested in becoming human. It put a smile on my face to see how he was trying to communicate his desires without breaking any rules. After we cured him, nothing changed with his activity level, I had to hack to move us then he ended up starving himself. I still think we could have used <strong>Reluca</strong> as she sounded like a competent player.</p><p><strong>Terrance</strong> was another interesting case. He would idle for extended amounts of time, wake up, ask to be healed, and go back to sleep. He did help out with some hunters from time to time but we finally decided the AP that went into healing and comforting him far outweighed his contribution to the team.</p><p><strong>Finola</strong> was a newbie, who helped out religiously at first doing research and helping with heals until all research was done and she had to focus on school, starving herself to death and probably feeling overwhelmed that she was thrown into a ship so active and demanding.</p><p>It's the details which make this ship special. You could find little bits of daily notes containing some pretty interesting roleplay fiction by <strong>Ian</strong>. I looked forward to these and "read them enthusiastically" every chance I got. I was really sad to wake up and not find him among us, I really liked the bugger.</p><p>*Chao* was roleplaying the hyperactive role very well! I even wondered if he ever slept in real life, as he was around <em>every single cycle</em>! It is thanks to him and his expedition organization efforts that I got as much glory as I did. His infatuation with the lovely <strong>Chun</strong> was interesting to watch. Who knew a googly eyed sociopath would be attracted to such a delicate thing. <strong>Chun</strong> kissed our booboos and helped <strong>Stephen</strong> provide us with comfort food. Her help was invaluable.</p><p><strong>Hua</strong> and <strong>Stephen</strong> had a rather interesting relationship, he was supporting her ever expanding figure (with lots of humor and jokes) and she was feeding his ego as a proud cook of gourmet weird alien parts. <strong>Stephen's</strong> arms kept me feeling good and warm inside, and he did not mind me spending time with <strong>Gioele</strong> and <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> from time to time. Hey! Variety is the salt of life!</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> had an unhealthy relationship with <strong>Eleesha's</strong> hair, which made up for some interesting reads. Applying duct tape was his solution to everything, but he did it so diligently that we didn't mind! As for <strong>Eleesha</strong> she was the jack of all trades, walking around proud of her hair polishing any spots we missed.</p><p><strong>Gioele</strong> did so much on the ship that he actually missed on sleep during the dreaded cycles 2 and 3. The cycles where everyone was asleep. I still don't know how he pulled it off, but my hat to you <strong>Gioele</strong>! I forgive you for smashing my nose when I had chicken pox.</p><p>I could swear that <strong>Freida</strong> cloned herself somehow. How else would she be able to scan, kill hunters and arrange expeditions all at the same time unless she had some sort of super power? These old bones never failed us.</p><p>Sad that <strong>Paola</strong> was not around to see us go back home, but she did her job well and got lucky with NERON upgrades. Within a few days we had everything we needed from comms center. Well done <strong>Paola</strong>!</p><p>Had it not been for one last very unlucky expedition which almost killed <strong>Gioele</strong> and me, leaving us without food or fuel, we would have lasted a few more days.</p><br><p>This was truly a great ship where people did not butt heads even though many were knowledgeable. We disagreed on some issues but then voting usually took care of any problems without any of the parties causing drama. It's that ability to band together, work together and stay organize is what helped us get this far. It was the different personality, humor and plain interesting people that made the repetitive and stressful cycle of <em>heal, fix, heal, extinguish, heal, comfort, heal</em> bearable.</p>

                <p>An amazing voyage with a fantastic crew. One of the best experiences I have had in any online game.</p><p>We did 26 explorations on 21 different planets. Mostly from day 6 to day 16 while the extremely active Chao was commander. At least once, we managed to explore different planets in cycles 5, 7, and 1. We visited 4 cristalite sectors and about 30 intelligent life sectors, but the only star map fragment we ever found was in a shipwreck on day 8, I think.</p><p>On day 17 cycle 1 Chao was killed when he got hit by a metal sheet, a room shake, and an electrical spike at the same time for a total of 12 damage. An absurd case of bad luck as we were generally very careful with healing people all the time.</p><p>This left me as commander. I was already losing faith in our lack of expedition luck and while Chao’s death didn’t cost us that many action points, it demoralized us and it meant one fewer player who could always be relied upon to be online for expeditions. So, we went from an expedition-heavy strategy to a survival-based one where we only scanned when Janice or Frieda had full IT points. Freeing me from scanning meant that I could help a lot with other stuff.</p><p>In the last four days, we made 3-4 1-fuel-jumps per day to constantly flee the hunters. This worked fairly well. At the end, we still had full hull, half shield and 4 scrap metal to repair the hull if needed. However, it meant that we slowly ran out of fuel. And as neither fuel nor steaks got replenished and our last expedition attempt was a disaster (the best event we had was wandering), we couldn’t keep flying forever even if we we’re doing well on most other parameters. Could we have survived to day 23? Probably. Day 24? I don’t think so.</p><p>What worked well:<br>- IRC channel. Started on day 5 it saved us thousands of in-game posts. Not everyone used it all the time, but all the active players visited now and then. And a few seemingly shy players (Frieda and Chun) got considerably more communicative in the IRC channel. I never had any serious lag in-game, but I also rarely had much more than 300 posts in total in the four threads I kept as favorites.</p><p>- Four turbo drones. They and Kuan Ti kept the number of broken things fairly low until the very end. One time three drones used two cycles on not repairing the astroterminal, but at another we had an electrical spike in the engine room, breaking everything. I dropped three drones there and it was all fixed next cycle. <br>Firefighter might have helped prevent drones from breaking a few times, but I'm not sure how useful it was - we never relied upon drones to put out fires.</p><p>- Ian’s jumpkin garden with heat lamps. Having lots of jumpkins is obviously good, but it worked really well here. Most of the players were in European time zones, which meant that Janice sometimes was the only one online in cycle 3. Then it was fantastic that she can fix everything by eating enough jumpkins and even help keep her morale up at the same time. <br>We usually carried the plants around during the day and dropped them in the garden at day change (we never figured out whether heat lamps work if the plant is held by someone in the garden?). We still managed to lose a few plants when the fires magically appeared in the garden just when Paola hadn’t been able to pick up the plants because of connection problems.</p><p>- High activity. Obviously. But simply the 20 seconds it takes a person to log in and tell whether she (and her dorm) needs healing or not will save a lot of movement points in the long run.</p><p>- Steaks. Okay, we were usually disappointed when intelligent life yet again gave us steaks, but doing many expeditions with two survivalists brought in enough steaks to make our two chefs run out of cooking points by freezing them a few times. This meant that we could eat a lot of rations which helped compensate for our somewhat low player count.</p><p>- Thermosensor. Everyone understands the value of diplomat and babel module, but I find that the thermosensor is often underappreciated. It is actually very useful when you’re visiting 16-sector-planets (or larger) and you’re only really interested in the two intelligent life sectors as you can then usually avoid doing a second expedition. <br>Strongly recommended if you have a diplomat.</p><p>Mage books: <br>Biologist: Finola - who was bronze medic<br>Medic: Ian – our two biologist+medic players made great progress in research. Finola wasn’t very active, but Ian was and managed to alternate with her when she came online. They died at almost the same time early day 13 as Ian was lost and killed on exploration and Finola starved. <br>Robotics Expert: Eleesha – who needed a new job and gave us a nice set of upgraded drones as Terrence wasn’t reliable.<br>Chef: Chun – obvious choice when we decided not to give her one of the research skills</p><p>The mush:<br>We were fortunate enough not to have suicidal mush, but instead a pair who was trying for an early Sol return. This meant that went we got them, they hadn’t caused any real damage – the worst was that Jin Su had wasted time.</p><p>Raluca used genius to give us the plasma shield day 1 and showed that she was a knowledgeable player, but was busted when the mycoscan revealed that the cat was infected – few cycles before she would have been able to finish Pilgred.</p><p>Jin Su was a mystery. He was a gold player who had bought a skin. As mush he was an inactive and inefficient commander – which he probably overdid as many wanted him killed no matter if they thought him mush or not. He might even have been killed before they would have been able to finish Pilgred, but I am not sure on the exact timing. I believed his inactivity to be a front hiding a good player and thus called for him to be cured rather than killed when we got Raluca. <br>After he was cured (around the day 4/5 change), he was very active for a few hours and even gave gold days to a few players. (How he decided that Eleesha and Chao were those who needed gold most at a time when he knew there was no more mush is another mystery.) Then he completely disappeared and starved to death. It was so abrupt that I guess something happened in his private life.</p><p>When you make many explorations, strange things can happen. <br>- The exploration crew returned from one expedition and wanted to do another immediately. They didn’t notice that Chun had entered Icarus Bay to freeze steaks while they were away. This resulted in a second expedition with Chun randomly selected as participant instead of Janice the diplomat. Not ideal.</p><p>- Another time there was some confusion about whether we should heal minor damage before leaving. This resulted in Janice picking up the medikit at the same time as I launched the expedition. So, we went on expedition with the medikit. And as Janice went to bed while we we’re away, she was still holding the medikit for the next cycles. This meant we couldn’t do another expedition, but it also meant that we couldn’t heal her before she came back online. We were quite worried at the time, but luckily she survived the cycle change.</p><p>- Janice usually slept standing in Icarus Bay so we could use her on expeditions even if she wasn’t online. Which we did very often. One time the exploration returned and we could deduce that Janice was the one who was ill, but we had no way of knowing how nasty an illness it was. She hadn’t taken any damage on expedition so we couldn’t heal her. To be able to heal and cure her, I decided to punch her once – and immediately busted her nose. (But at least I cured her of smallpox.)</p><p>- We managed to lose the compass (early), a blaster, and a rope (and some post-its) along the way. I brought a camera on several expeditions hoping to lose it, but no luck. <br>Players were regularly lost and found on days 7-12. Then Ian was lost and unfortunately died. After that hardly anyone was lost for the rest of the expeditions.</p><p>- We generally got a nice set of projects completed. The only less useful one was the anti-gravity thrusters – the one time we tried it, it still resulted in a landing accident.</p><br><p>A great game deserves a long post.</p><p>/Gioele, tired and proud commander</p>

                <p>Another point:<br>- Predictability: We only had two reliable pilots (Hua and Frieda). They were very active, but could of course not be online all the time. They were very good at informing us when they would be online again which helped a lot in planning so we could decide when to send someone to the 2-shell-turret and when to wait.</p>

                <p>Hua here! o/ As i said 22 days and 2 cycles of fun. Our ship was far from perfect -but even this just made the journey better.</p><p>Some things ill never forget: - like the huge fight between Ian and Chao in the first days when our pacifist&amp;botanist was trying to convince everyone that we HAVE to build Old Faithful and the crazy-eyed "bloodthirsty" Chao who was against it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> At that time i thought that my world was upside-down but then they clashed again a cycle later - this time Ian wanted the White Flag but Chao again said no and everything went back to normal : ) Curse the RNG for killing you so early Ian <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Our first expedition - when Chao made us explore a dangerous planet equipped mostly with post-its but noone complained because he was holding the the only blaster/s on board. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Our last expedition on day 21 - when the RNG almost killed us all on one of the safest planets we explored for the whole journey. 7 accidents in a row is just not fair. And our joy when we barely survived ( with 2-3 hp each ) ( despite our expectations for a huge haul of food/fuel and artifacts )</p><p>The horrible way our commander Chao died - he was hit by a steel plate, electrocuted and shaken to death on the first cycle of day 17. Neron on the other hand was quite happy....<img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> Strangely Chao continued to report broken equipment days after he died - we were quite spooked when we saw that our Neron administrator is not behind it. Maybe you were trying to look after us from beyond....<img src="../../../../gfx/square/zombie.png" alt=":zombie:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And of course the hundreds of intelligent life forms that gave their lives so we have enough alien steaks for the journey. As Hua i really appreciated your sacrifice.</p><p>Special thanks for Chao and Gioele - best commanders i ever had. <br>Janice for all the hugs she gave me - and the patience to listen to all of my problems ( mostly about my figure and nightmares that Stepehn is cooking for other people ),I<br>Ian - great mush-hunter and n1 botanist ( your Jumpkin legacy helped us to the very end )<br>Stephen - best cook in the galaxy ( my figure is a big proof of that ), <br>Kuan Ti - for keeping the ship together ( tho i really think we should take more duct tape for the next trip ) <br>Frida - we were a great pilot team <br>Eleesha - the firefighter with best hair in the galaxy <br>Chun &amp; Paola - it was a pleasure playing with you two</p><p>and of course <br> <br>'Death weight" Terrence - i think for the 17 days he was with us he logged less then 10 times - and did something useful for only half of them. Going inactive for days at a time but not before picking up important equipment like the scooter or lenses or just taking a bed. You are the living proof that you dont need play to reach 300+ glory and enter the top 70 leader board A true hero for the inactive mush community. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I thin we did great for a mixed MMM&amp;random ship. We probably had at least 1 more day in us - but we were quite tired in the end so we decided to return home and try again later.</p>

That's long, especially for my second Mush game ever.</p><p>The first few days, projects got cleared SO quickly, it was amazing. After a time however, around day 9-11, I almost had nothing to do, since everything was so efficient and our sole objective really were expeditions.</p><p>I must confess I have been a little inactive then <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico">. However after a few days, the realization of our long run set in deeper, and I became more active (Especially because of that IRC, it's a much better communication tool than the forums).</p><p>In the end, if we weren't so unlucky, we could've gone for day 23... perhaps 24.</p><p>If (and when) castings are released on the english server, I definitely want to be with you guys<img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.</p>
