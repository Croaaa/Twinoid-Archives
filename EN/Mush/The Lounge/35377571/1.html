                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2299">The End</a></p><p>I'm doing an AP, not because this game was awesome or memorable, I just figured I'd like someone to do an AP of the game I've played, but better to just take the initiative and do it myself!</p><p>I'm playing <strong>Ian</strong> here and I only have one question. <strong>Who took my bananas?</strong></p><p>I figured I'd just hang back this ship, I played Chun on the previous one and was basically consumed by this game all hours around the clock so I figured I'd just relax, be Ian, be a bit weird and calm in the chat - and not hunt mush at all, I'll leave that to the others. Just wanted to tend to my plants.</p><p>I am partially responsible for the mush victory, and I'll come clean here further down, because it's all a bit of fun and I know full well why mush had it easy this game. The entire human team were led to believe by strong conviction that Raluca was human (<em>and she was, most of the duration of the ship</em>) and that ended in an easy Pilgred repair. I'd love to hear additions, because this is my own view of this round and I certainly didn't see and know everything. Take this post with a grain of salt. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In the end I never got to do much work at all, because of the eat-two-food test, the crew consumed all my bananas and I didn't get to plant any new ones. I strongly spoke out about this, was ignored and I thought I'd be killed any day for condoning mush-tests of that kind.</p><p>Now to the part where I <strong>sort of</strong> lost us the game, ofcourse not intentional, I always want us to do our best and I'm in for the long run. When my bananas were gone in the <strong>laboratory</strong> and the logs didn't say anyone picked them up (no cameras, and probably no one in there, so might be why) I searched because I figured they got hidden. I was wrong. I found the <strong>Hacker Kit</strong> of all things, so I immediately wanted to tell Chun. She wasn't available for a private chat, having played Chun I know communication can be quite busy, so I asked her to contact me through the public chat. She did, but not before I told Roland that I had found it and need to get in contact with Chun. Roland was the self-appointed leader of the ship since Jin Su was most likely brain-dead and Roland seemed to be the one trying to organize most things. I got in contact with Chun, she asked me to *hide* it in central corridor. I went there and saw her standing there.</p><p>Here comes my error, and now I know the importance of "wasting"/"saving" 1 AP. I asked Chun if I really need to hide it since she's there. I dropped the kit and waited for an answer. Eventually 1.5 hours later the cycle was turning over and no response, so I said, I'll go to a bed, please tell me if you need the thing hid. I didn't say, but my intention was to not waste the 1 AP because I tried to both be a good botanist and a good researcher. No answer, later I see Chun write in the public chat that Frieda picked it up and asked her to give it back.</p><p>No one probably thought this was the biggest scariest thing, that Frieda had picked it up, since everyone believed Raluca to be human. No one, I guess (atleast I had no clue), thought that PILGRED was anywhere near complete.</p><p>My first two ships have had one mush either "suiciding" the first day or been removed by Neron, which has led to either an inactive mush or one that cooperated with the human crew, this is the first ship I have with active mush that actually try to do something, lesson learned. Well played mush!</p><p>Personally I wanted to thank <strong>Finola</strong> for role-playing with me, it made me not feel too alone in a very chaotic ship. My last thoughts go to my plants... I loved them.</p><p>Next ship!</p>

                <p>I had it sitting at about 50% and then when I was turned, I just sped completion with Terrence. The original plan had been to hack the terminals, but we actually had a backup.

                <p>Yeah, Terrence here. I managed to get a early spike on Raluca when she asked for PILGRED to be reset. I figured that returning to Sol was our bets shot, so I tried to double spike her at the end/start of the following day. After that I was waiting for another day to pass so I could spike and body hop into Chao, but then Frieda found the hacker kit.</p><p>Quite the strong start for the humans. I was halfway tempted to just dismantle the other shower and use dirt trap on as many people as I could before grabbing the fire-extinguishers and apron before blowing myself up in the Pasiphae.</p>

The Hacker Kit incident definitely was a stroke of luck, being my third ship with the two first one having basically no mush, I never thought a victory could happen that fast.
