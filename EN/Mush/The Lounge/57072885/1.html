Plasma shield, net (no escape for mush), 5 pilots, 2 techs, strong research team, active Chun.</p><p>First big mistake of human crew was not shooting trader with PILGRED. We had inactive to sell, clear sky and trader was there for a several cycles after game start. The reasons I didn't sell Derek for PILGED at the begining of game - I was not sure Eleesha will be able to finish my job and I also wanted both of us survive. But Eleesha came too late so we left this trader.</p><p>I decided to wait and play "human" as long as I can. What choice did I have? My partner left me, Eleesha became inactive, and soon humans killed her because she was not starving. I couldn't become dirty without being suspect, I had no reason to visit BD, so I just waited. I wished they will start kill each other. A lot of them made mistakes. Dirty Paola, Jin Su who often did strange things, a lot of people dirty and crossing BD, a lot of them eating food they didn't cook.<br>I made no any mistake. I calculated all my ap. I marked all the cycles I consumed food - I never could be catched as not starving person, and I always was looking for opportunity to hide this additional ap from rations.<br>I was active, nice, communicative, helpful. Time on my side yet.<br>But they didn't kill anybody, just Hua at D11. I just told she is dirty and they killed her. I didn't push, never blamed anyone. All other time they just do their job. So did I. I spammed mush channel to let them think there is more than one mush here in case they will finish pheromodem. And I hope it worked.</p><p>D12C3 was the final point. I still waited and hoped to see any of last techs die from steel plate or fires, this would give me a good chance for clear victory with transfer to another tech. I gave them big planet with big chance to die (too many zones). I also had a plan to take last oxygen or turn shield off with <em>bypass</em> skill. <br>I also hoped to take another body just for little glory (my glory was zero because I survived so many cycles)<br>All this actions could lead to my fail because with 2 techs you can easy finish PILGRED so my main goal at this time was surviving. Self healing. I didn't understand why am I still alive with all this proven humans - I was ready to run anytime.</p><p>Janice entered lab. I am ready to run. Janice has knife, I know it. But she just consumed banana and left. I followed her on my tracker. She entered nexus and did some change there (I saw message from neron in main channel). And I realized she <strong><em>turned shield off</em></strong>. I hoped she did it to catch me may be, or may be it is some kind of method to restart shield, I don't know. But no, it was not for surviving but for death of all ship.<br>Next hunters attack wiped out almost all our hull, we had only 3% now. <br>This is where I felt a little frustration. All this days of hard work and this end was unfair.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"><br>I pointed on this action in main channel, I still saw opportunity for humans to win but at the D12C3 Daedalus was destroyed. I think it was Gioele who took off patrooler and finished us all.<br>Victory? May be. But I don't like when humans don't fight when they have a chance. And there was a chance.<br>So this is the story. May be first game where I didn't use any mush skill and didn't extract any spore at all.<br>I really liked all the people on this ship and I hope to see almost all of them in future games.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
