                <p>Okay Darjus let me break it down for you seeing as you continue to post about how stupid the crew was and how "it was a giant noob ship".</p><p>I was Andie.. I was asked to kill you. While initially I refused and didn't want to, eventually I had to give in and go through with it because even if I didn't you would have been dead within a cycle or two due to other people killing you.</p><p>Here are the reasons you were killed, broken down for you so you can stop your shit talking all over the forum.. Or not, whatever.</p><p>1. Firstly, before mush selection you took all of the items (including weapons) and moved them to a secret location, never bothering to update astropad or telling us where the items were. I asked you MULTIPLE times in general chat and in PM where you put the weapons, in case you got turned to mush. You ignored me every single time. After mush selection you went to wherever you took the weapons and hid them without telling anyone. I PM'd you telling you that you must PM Chun and tell her where these weapons were, and that I would be checking up with her to see if you had done this.</p><p>2. You were very arrogant and rude to just about everyone you came in contact with, especially new players. While this isn't exactly a crime in itself, you graduated to publicly accusing about 4 people of being mush on the first day and said they acting sucpiciously. This only made yourself look bad/suspicious and ended up making the crew turn against you.</p><p>3. You entered Icarus Bay with Frieda alone in there and no camera/mycoalarm. This was for an expo you explicitly said <strong>you would not go on.</strong> If you do not want to go on the expo, why are you entering an unprotected IB with someone in there?</p><p>4. When you chit-chatted with me, there were multiple "Get up" actions which can often mean mush trying to hide their actions. The second time you chit-chatted with me there were THIRTEEN "write" logs. The day before, you told me you would come and chitchat with me so I could see your actions, only for me to see a complete list of you making 58 god damn post-its in Icarus Bay. On an expo we didn't need Post-its on, in a place you shouldn't have been (this was after you entered the first time, by the way), when to my knowledge, they made it so that there is no benefit to having a post-it in a room when there is a fire.</p><p>5. I gave you so many chances and hints that you were under suspicion it wasn't even funny. In retrospect I shouldn't have even done that because it just would have tipped you off if you were mush. I tried to look at it objectively and put my frustration with your behavior aside. I told Frieda I was not going to kill you. I said we needed to wait. In the end, Frieda or Derek were coming to kill you within a cycle or two regardless. I asked you about the manual "get up" and you arrogantly laughed at me and said "WTH, does it matter how I get up?". I asked you about the post-its, you laughed again. I asked you if there was anything already in the logs that I could go and look at to prove you were human. You said no but that you had been clean 100% of the time (which really doesn't mean anything when you are in an out of a shower room constantly). For the record I am against mush tests and stated I was NOT requesting you to take one, but this was me basically trying to hint to you that hey, you need to stop acting like a damn mush because people want you dead.</p><p>I wasn't going to comment on your "fail thread" post because I didn't want to get involved but really, when you go around talking crap about your team members when they treated you fairly and tried their best to deal with your attitude, it is pretty piss poor. This is mush, accidents happen. Time to get over it.</p>

This is stupid you know <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> It was funny for me since it was such a terrible reason to suspect someone being mush. I did tell you that i did not knew about it since i never ever looked for mush like that . <br>Made post it notes in case of a fire and does it matter if i made 20 or more ? Usually people do make 20 or such <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Frieda accused me of making fake Neron posts and that was 1 of her reasons to kill me as well.</p><p>Ye you did say stuff about being against food test , should have realized that you want me to take one . Next time just say so since i were always ready to do so if needed . Died while taking ration for food test lol .</p>

                <p>Not on your ship but I can totally see why the crew would turn against you... maybe you should try to explain your actions a bit better. Anyway, not my issue just wanted to add that those post it masses aren't necessarily made because of that rebutted theory on saving things from fires but in case a fire breaks the block and leaves you unable to create them when needed. Though you could still use rotting food, the t shirt, plastic scrap and such.</p><br><p>And I don't think this thread is a good idea. There's the thing spaz said and we already have the Missed Connections thread so if these call-outs are just for arguments sake then... yeah no.</p>

                <p>No clue why I thought that? I guess it was because you ignored my repeated questions about it and Chun confirmed you hid weapons but she understandably didn't tell us where.</p><p>If you were checking on Derek and I missed the message/forgot then I apologize. It definitely wasn't on purpose.</p><p>With the "get up" action, it was always (to my knowledge) seen as a suspicious move back when Chao had torturer. Mush would manually get up out of bed in order to help hide previous actions in case Chao came and tortured them. I could understand one "get up" action but this was multiple. Then the next day with 13 post-it actions in the chit-chat log I really had no choice but to let the crew know. While it is perfectly reasonable to not know about the "get up" thing, you need to look at it from our point of view too. To us, you were trying to hide things and then making excuses we couldn't verify.</p><p>I did not want you to take a food test. I desperately asked if you had <strong>previously</strong> done anything definitely human because Frieda had literally just told me that if I didn't kill you, she would be doing it herself in the next cycle. I had been telling her to wait and needed concrete proof. Definitely not trying to throw Frieda under the bus here, ultimately it was still my choice to go and kill you and I take responsibility for that. I think her view was really justified and don't blame her for thinking that way. I always refuse mush tests and never ask people to do them, I thought I was clear in that. There was no hint for you to go and take one, the hint was "hey you're under serious suspicion please don't do anything silly". Sorry I thought I was clear enough without completely giving it away.</p><p>Anyway, all in all it was a misunderstanding and I am sorry you got killed. I started to enjoy our PM chat despite being rubbed the wrong way at the start. I hope your next ship ends up better for you and more enjoyable!</p>

Standing up only appears when you click the "Get up" button.</p><p>Now let's end this discussion here. Spaz explained why the thread wasn't a good idea in the first place and, as Chime said, there is already a thread to find people from finished ships. And if you have scores to settle, then do so in private messages, not in the forum.</p>
