                <p>Well this ship is still going , i just want to take few words and explain some stuff. I won't reveal some important information , just want to say some words about how bad luck i am in this FUCKING LIFE! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So mostly Frieda or Chun from my ship may read this here guess they were TE fellas xD</p><p>Anyway i start play Jin, it was weekend night that i choosed him. Ship was SO active for sometimes, which made me happy since i could start RPing and felt like keep going. But after that i woke up i saw this message after MANY ships going on "Welcome to Mush!" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> Then <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"> was my reaction , Why? i was happy to be mush after such a long time second reaction was due to fact i knew i couldn't be much online for some days after this. As some of my friends here know i got accepted in Nurse college and now am a nurse student. Its a pleasent thing but its didn't let me that much free time you know.</p><p>So i tryed my best at first to get some idea about ship. Start gathering information on how many spores people got and messaged my partner sometimes. I just wanted to take very slow at first and was like "Alright just for now keep looking ship and when i came back after few days i can start the game!" such a stupid idea i know <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So before going for college i saw Terrence visited BD with no reason <strong>facepalm</strong> why? cause with Chun and Frieda we had it was near impossible to just slip away. I told him to becareful and make up some reasons for it, if not just fly out soon after i said i am going offline, ((not sure if he read mush channel or not)) and when i came back we do something together.<br>That night i just peeked at game for a second saw Terrence is dead and most of important research are done in blitz speed. That moment i created a good plan to rampage, i would convert Kuan ti in AD and rush to BD and attack Hua, then transfer to Janice and finish Hua off. Then declare ceasefire till next day to do more damage. But as some may know we have a festival in Iran called "Yalda Night" which is first night of winter and that night i had my brother as guest so couldn't get online that night to finish my job ((Plan was supposed to be C8 since with terrence death they had MB)) Well long story short they sold Janice and destroyed this plan <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> but my baddest mistake for myself was when i got on PC in morning i didn't plan to click on mush icon but i did and got online in game ((Got woke up from inactivity )) so after seeing how plan is ruined i tryed to do some good stuff around by speaking and finally extracting in that day. But then after so manys hours after college came to see i am dead.</p><br><p>Soooo whats the point of this topic?<br>1. Sorry Terrence, I hate inactive partners like what i was. We could do some good damage but i wasn't online to share the idea with you ((Since with my skills lvl 14 mush i could get two of most important characters in 2 cycle ))</p><p>2. Good job to human team, they played really nicely but come on its just hard to not panic after seeing 5 research is done and one of your partner is dead xD</p><p>3. to myself i should learn to take some risks at some points , I could ((in time i was playing )) before going get some good chance to extract and even infect but i couldn't continue it since i kind of was afraid of being exposed <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> lol i know right? Such a pussy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But god sake i enjoyed from the ship even thought i couldn't do shit <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"> So see you guys flying around â™¥</p><p>((Will post link after ship is done))</p><p>((P.S: Paola it was good to kill me, since if i was cured i couldn't be that much active afterall , Gioele will make a good commander <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> But after few days weekend will come! So not sure <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ))</p>
