                <p>Hiah! Your trustworth, never sure what should think Finola here! (<a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1874">Comes from this ship!</a>)<br>Well, what to say... I've enjoyed this ship soooo muuuch, that I can't even explain it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Every single action or word from somebody was making him suspicious for me! To the end of our run I still wasn't sure about that we've already killed all the mush. I think I could do better on this ship- actually I think that my decision changed the future of Janice first, and then of the whole ship. If I would use few more AP to come to Janice and heal her, If I would be more decided that we shouldn't trust Jin Su... Your death, Janice, actually started the "chain of death". Eleesha, Kuan Ti, Stephen- they suicided because of your lack. I've even wrote speeches for every of You, after your deaths ^^ Sadly also, that I couldn't manage my AP totally properly- I was doing sometimes unnecessary actions, while I should spend most of them on researches and ask more decidedly for resets. We wasn't able to research Retro Serum at all :c I've noticed too late my many mistakes. Return to Sol... Well, I don't know who moved the Daedalus, but yeah, we couldn't do anything more I think. <br>Kuan Ti! I've tried save You, brought a pill, but You were offline much more often from few cycles <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> <br>Well then! Thank You so much! Thanks for funny conversations, brain-eating discussions, words of hope, smiles, helpful hands.<br>I will always remember how great it was to talk with You, my trustworth friend Ian! <br>I will remember that You spoiled your tomato soup on my lab desk, Stephen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>Our discussions about who is mush with Terry and Kuan Ti, and then Eleesha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>Your late, but hopeful actions in the end, Paola.<br>Your heroic charge for oxygen, Hua!<br>The mission which You gave to me, Jin Su <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> <br>I will remember all of You, comrades, I will try! Thank You again!</p><p>PS I've saved maybe half of our private discussions and the funniest public ones xd I wonder that there were maybe three times more private discussions than I think <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And I will probably never know about them, awww <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
