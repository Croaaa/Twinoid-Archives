                <p>The ship started promising, lots of active people (some thanks to a TE jump), several techs that got plasma shield done in an heartbeat and just a few inactive people.</p><p>I was really excited about the ship, until the last person joined and I was selected as mush. Don't get me wrong, I love being mush but I knew it was going to be hard with an active crew. Kuan Ti was my partner and he was also active and gold. Being gold and high level gave us some more options but the humans were playing well and it was hard to find a way to carry our plans. We thought about several options, trapping bays to get pilots, green jelly and defacer could be options to spike people but they were always risky since it could get targets on our backs (and probably the fact that I usually play Eleesha makes me more paranoid that anything will be seen as suspicious <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">). And while we were trying to figure the best action, Paola went officially inactive and I became comms manager, dream job for a mush.</p><p>There were a few things helping us, we seemed to be both trusted and we were on a chat with Chun and several humans. A scrapmetalgate situation got some suspicion on Jin su and later on Raluca but everything got clarified before anyone got killed over it. KT also managed to get one spore on Janice by trapping central corridor.</p><p>But then we reached day 4 and mycoscan was done, Janice said she would scan herself soon, natamy riffle was the next research being done. Chun was using premonition a lot so we would always need to be careful for a mushy thing not being the last one done. Chun was also nice enough to bring a cooked ration and the apron for me to front corridor, removing what I hope, would be an excuse to get dirty.</p><p>So our options were getting reduced, the only plan that would bring us a sure victory was to rush pilgred (that was at 52%) and jump back to sol. And so we did it, we had ap saved and we finished pilgred, I transfered to Jin Su and returned us to sol. We were extremely lucky that we were trusted because Chun was online and she saw me moving pass front corridor but just thought I had missed her message and not that I was going to do something fishy. If she had guarded the corridor we would be finished (but KT only finished pilgred after I had already transfered and was at the bridge to decrease the chances of someone reacting).</p><p>I'm sad that the ship ended so fast, it would have been fun to keep playing with everyone. It wasn't a super exciting plan but it still gave us an adrenaline rush doing it and, more important for us, a mush victory. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

I was planning on making it up to you guys, but then I got tricked in my sleep :&lt;</p><p>This was a really fun ship, though. Kinda sad it had to end so early, but I don't blame our mush.

                <p>And to think that I was soo nice and hugged You Elemele! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>You might be surprised but I contacted privatly Chun not so long time before Your victory (C8? C7? Something like that) and I said my concerns about You Elemele. I never had any suspicions about Kuan Ti, but You did looked bit fishy to me. No apparent reason - nothing logical. Just my "inner feeling". Of course because of that I didn't pointed finger on You screaming "MUSH!". Insted I asked Chun how much does She trust to You, and I said that I think our chat has been compromised <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Looks like I should trust my feelings even more than I thought <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Your Central Corridor trap has been foreseen by me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I saw that Chun put there coffe, and that few people went through there. So I said to myself - there is good chance we do have trap here. At first I wanted to drink it, and than scan myself - but 3 spores were possible, so I ended up carrying it back to Chun so She will drink it. From that moment I waited until Scaner was ready - logs were copied and stored saefly in notebook <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> If I would see that spore - Jin Su or Kuan Ti would HAVE to be reason behind that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But apart from that - nothing special on this ship! 4 days are too short to actually be able to say anything more interesting.

Even more now that I do know You were aiming originaly at total conversion. While I would never play to make it easier for You both, I am VERY sad it didn't worked out for You <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> Ah... Well... Happens <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>EDIT: Oh... And... Um...

                <p>So I walk into the dojo, feeling a bit cocky for no particular reason. There's a crowd of bright and eager faces gathered inside, ready to spar. We all bow to each other and begin our warm-up exercises.</p><p>Then I hear a voice call out: "<em>Step into the ring, and I'll be with you in a moment.</em>"</p><p>I crack my knuckles and stretch one last time, waiting for the opponent to make a move. Flickers of motion in my peripheral view catch my attention. I whirl around and take a few jabs, swiping at nothing but air. I lose my balance and stumble as the shifting shadows taunt me. Slowly I begin to circle the ring, sweating and breathing hard. Finally, I catch a fleeting glimpse of movement and I lunge toward it, screaming "SHOW YOURSELF!"</p><p>The next thing I know, I'm lying face-down on the training mat, and the master whispers into my ear: "<em>You hesitated.</em>"</p><br><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/zhong_chun.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_ZC:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chun here!</strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It's hard to explain why I was so <em>delighted</em> with this <strong>utter defeat.</strong> My first ship was destroyed by Hunters, mainly due to inactivity. My second ship, I was the first to be killed by a human griefer, followed by a bloodbath of revenge murders that eliminated most of the crew. My 3rd-6th ships were all easy Human victories.</p><p><strong>I had never experienced a real take-down by a skillful Mush team.</strong><br>I was beginning to lose faith in the challenge they're supposed to represent.<br><em>But now my faith has been restored.</em> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I selected Chun because I wanted to try my hand at the hunt, but I didn't feel like I was ready to attempt Eleesha's role yet. I thought it would be fun to coordinate the investigations as the central hub of Human trust. I did get a good glimpse of that experience, but I wish I had had more opportunity to gather clues and piece it all together... Next time, perhaps...</p><p>I roleplayed Chun with a weary resignation to her fate as a lab rat, and with PTSD anxiety from being the sole survivor of the horrors of the Tamina incident. Janice was a fantastic Shrink, keeping "files" on everyone, taking notes on our behavior, and asking probing psychological questions. So there was a natural chemistry between us that was a lot of fun to play. I was planning to "prove" to everyone, once and for all, that my psychic powers are <em>REAL!</em> But my RP really slipped once I started focusing on the hunt. It's hard to stay in character under pressure. I'll have to work on that.</p><p>Ahh, Eleesha... Kuan Ti... All those subtle misdirections... <em>sigh...</em> <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/surprise.gif" alt=":anim_surprised:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>At least I don't have to say "I trusted you!!" I watched you both pretty closely. But you never gave me any reason to suspect you until the very end. I suppose I should have studied my logs more.... Did you even do anything that a Human could have detected? (I mean, before the obvious.)</p><p>I have this impression that Eleesha is one of the best characters to be as Mush. Free roam of the ship. Pivotal to the hunt. Ample opportunities to orchestrate mayhem, with little or no accountability. But a Mush <em>Nepsy</em> Eleesha? Well that's practically a guaranteed death sentence for the Humans! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I did start to suspect you toward the very end, Eleesha. Just a gut feeling, like Janice said. It seemed like Comms was progressing slowly. So I brought you some food to help speed it up, or possibly detect a discrepancy in your energy use. It was basically a trap, but I didn't know how much pressure you were already under. If I had known what reaction it would provoke, I most certainly would have guarded the corridor! Lesson learned. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p>You know, I even specifically mentioned on Day 2 that we don't want to push research too fast, so we don't force the Mush to act in desperation. I realized after the ship ended that I could have controlled the pace by withholding Chun's presence from the Lab, which would have fit perfectly with my Lab-weary roleplay (although it might have angered the humans). But I didn't attempt to manage the pace at all, simply because I didn't know what a reasonable pace would be. I think I've gained a better understanding of that now.</p><p>Well, I could go through the play-by-play of the <span class="tid_strike">wild-goose chase</span> Mush hunt if anyone is curious. But this is already a wall of text, so I'll wrap up for now.</p><p>I had a great time playing with all of you. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Hats off to Eleesha and Kuan Ti for their stealth and swift execution. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"></p>

(I mean, before the obvious.)</cite></p><p>Not really, the most suspicious from me was what I wasn't doing. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> The only thing you could have caught was lower health after taking a sneaky shower, I removed a spore in d2c8 and took a sneaky shower right after. I didn't take splashproof because I wanted to leave my options open so I lost some health. But thanfully right after on d3c1 there was a room shake that could explain me being lower health (i just lost 1hp on it).</p><p><cite>So I brought you some food to help speed it up, or possibly detect a discrepancy in your energy use. It was basically a trap, but I didn't know how much pressure you were already under.</cite></p><p>The thing is, I was ready for that trap so if pilgred wasn't so high that we could make a move, I would have eaten it and phagocyte the spore I had for the extra ap. But it made me suspicious that I was being suspected. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Regarding Eleesha as mush, I really think she's one of the best chars to be mush and specially if you're a lvl 5 Eleesha. Technician can give excuses to be dirty, it's easier to infiltrate a mush hunt, you can wander around the ship, you can be in bravo dorm to "keep an eye on who goes there" (and I really do that as human too so it's not a mush tell for me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">), access to the list (or to be anonymush and say there's no mush left)...</p><p>And about the pace of research, it's really hard to balance. As human I do the same "mistake" of wanting research done asap, cameras everywhere, mycoalarms and then I'm left thinking "well, how i am supposed to find mush now if they can't really do much besides rampage?". For me personally, antispore and constipaspore are not big issues since I'm a high level mush so fertile and mycelium can balance it back. But mycoalarms + paranoid gioele protects most of the rooms. And mycoscan makes it more difficult if the crew is good at scanning themselves.</p>

                <p>Hello, the most charming guy of the crew is now here! I was Kuan Ti, and I do apologize also for the short trip!</p><p>Nepsy explained better than I'll ever do what happened. And yes, Chun, we tried to stay undercover so we wouldn't be suspected. I picked Splashproof, so no one would test me with the Medikit. What no one realized is that I was fixing things and advancing Projects with free skill points! So it seemed I was active, but my AP were for Mush stuff!</p><p>Even for my dirty status... I reported once in the Dirty Thread, and another time in any of the other thread, so it wouldn't be suspicious, but there would be a report. And Chun, when I opened a tab with you to say about Jin's scrap metal situation I knew you had a tab with other people to discuss it. I just wanted to be part of it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>About the coffee: Yep, it wasn't spiked. I knew no one would drink a coffee from the shelf... But they would click the shelf at sometime, so I picked Trapper and did it.</p><p>About PILGRED: I relayed Raluca just ONCE. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> And it was only for having an excuse to be dirty. I didn't trap ER, but I was grateful she was dumping a lot of points there. It turned out to be our final plan. I stood in ER, and waited for Eleesha to transfer, arrive at Bridge. And then I finished it. I even had time to wave goodbye.</p><p>Europa, this is the second ship we go together. You, human me, mush. You were Jin Su, I was Hua. We shared ideas in a tab, and then I got converted in one of the bays. You PMed me after the ship to ask if I was mush the whole time. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Thank you all for the RP, for being active. When I saw myself as Mush in a TE jump I said to myself "I'll last 3 cycles". Thank you Nepsy for the partnership, it was great!</p>
