We get Plasma Shield, Fire Detector and Extra Drone</p><p><strong>D4C7:</strong> We finish Mycoscan and then, <em><strong>MASSACRE</strong></em> Deaths: Roland (mush) Hua, Terrence, , Giole (mush, transferred from finola), Kuan Ti and Raluca</p><p><strong>D4:</strong> After the massacre, we've begun a trade, very few o2, we decide to rush PILGRED</p><p><strong>D5:</strong> PILGRED is at 49%, We traded a hydropot we got through proyect for 12 o2.</p><p><strong>D6C7</strong>: PILGRED finished, came back to SS (a few mins ago)</p><p>In my opinion, I made a lot of mistakes on this game, but I also learned my fair share of things, thanks to Kuan for that!</p><p>Anyways, I think if we had pilots we may have reached a lot more, but, oh well. Better than Nothing</p><p>Ship Link: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/11172" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/11172</a></p><p>-<img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico">DefenseLover<img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"></p>

A lot of my partners on ships were bronze or silver. And "planning a rampage" isn't that big of an achievement. It's just "yo, I can't be assed to try and actually work towards a mush win so let's just fill our AP bars and kill a bunch of people" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Besides, as I said, Chun made it super easy for you. You had the location of all the alarms. And we had no idea who the mushes were. The long game could have granted you another mush, but you had no patience. Rampaging is on the same level with running off in a patroller. On both my last ships, the mushes simply uncreatively rampaged. I played techs on both of them so of course I died first. It annoys me when people justify the lack of skill slots for their laziness.</p>

                <p>Being a high level gold mush and mush life for conversion route gets smoothly and the most fun way to win I think. Being a bronze mush and in active ships also being a silver mush makes the conversion route very difficult instead (anonymush is already one skill slot which may be needed unless victim gets converted indirectly or at good timing).<br>It would at least need much planning and overlapping plus long activity times of mushes plus the occurrence and usage of the right moment.<br>Something which can not be expected, it is rather an interesting exception to witness.</p><p>I like people who go for conversion, i am actually also one of them, but conversion people have still just their reasons, not THE reason to aim for it.</p>

                <p>When humans are smart and active, even a rampage may require extensive pre-planning, smart timing, and solid skill choices to pull off successfully. Not to mention good target prioritization and crew activity awareness. I never rampage right out of the gate, but there is often a point where continuing to play the long game is likely to get you cured or killed, and you need to switch tactics if you want a shot at winning. Time is a mush's worst enemy.</p><p>Alas, poor mush. Blamed for cheap play/luck when they win, suffer backseat strategists going "well actually" when they fail.</p>

So in terms of time, they had plenty of that to at least convert someone else.... Roland did good in his skills choice. Finola? maybe..... The fact that Fino chose Transfer right off the bat locked up their options. And Roland was so good at playing human nobody even turned to look at him and say "this guy might be mush". I also don't mind a rampage when you're out of options entirely or when you're simply exposed one way or another.
