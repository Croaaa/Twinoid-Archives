                <p><strong>Day 1 </strong>- I wake up as little Janice, getting ready to make the crew happy and to make some alien friends on expos. I look around and the crew looks amazing, several gold players, plasma shield geniused already. I was getting excited about it and when the last person joins I get the dreaded "Welcome to Mush" message. It was just my second time as alpha mush and the first with a very active crew so I was interested in see how I could do. Eleesha was my partner, none of us had really many excuses to be dirty. I was planning on taking sneak showers whenever I got a chance to spore and to go to bravo dorm without looking too suspicious. Having IT points to help cover some ap usage (if the crew forget about it) was nice. So I dared to spore twice on d1, before antispore was finished. Eleesha was going to build the sofa to cover for dirtyness but by a second Gioele was faster and they both posted they finished the sofa, with her being dirty for "it". She said it could have been a bug but I was almost sure she was going to be killed. But Gioele decided to demand her to do a mush test and I started arguing with him against mush testing. Not because I was mush but because I, as the player, think mush tests are incredibly ship and they ruin the fun of a proper investigation. Gioele didn't like my arguments and my (honest!) suggestions about how to do an investigation and wanted me to do a mush test too. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> I think if he was less insistent on mush testing and more on properly investigating Eleesha he and the crew would have acted much more quickly. So thank you Gioele for creating a distraction, you were very helpful for us, mushes.</p><p>We both picked tracker (+ splashproof) and then I picked fertile and anonymush. I trapped nexus, Eleesha trapped one of the bays. My first spore was picked by Raluca and hers by Roland. At the end of d1 antispore and constipaspore were finished. Mycoscan was going to be next and we knew we had to act fast if we wanted to convert someone. Eleesha risked going to the engine room and spiked Raluca on her way (she was in a rear storage). We got lucky again that the crew thought it weird but didn't act.</p><p><strong>Day 2 -</strong> I was hoping Raluca was going to nexus to get the second spore I trapped there but Gioele went there and got it. But soon after the opportunity arrived. Thanks to fertile I was able to spore without costing ap and when Raluca and I went both to nexus to relay on some project I spiked her, welcoming her to our team! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Day 3</strong><br>After this we had to lay very low. Mycoscan was ready and Gioele and Roland's spores were found. Eleesha was under close watch so she was going between medlab and lab. And I didn't dare walk in bravo dorm on d3 with fear it would become too suspicious. I was wondering what we could do when Gioele decided to help Raluca with pilgred. And by help, Gioele meant: wanting to finish it. They took it to 87% before they ran out of ap. The crew said to stop immediately but Gioele kept arguing that he wanted his coffee. Even I argued against finishing pilgred before mush were killed (hey, i was trying to look human! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico">) but with that % Raluca would be able to finish it alone easily. So that bring us to...</p><p><strong>Day 4</strong><br>We all found a time we could be online (which made me wake up earlier... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico">). With all anti mush research done and natamy riffle being the next, we had to do something drastic or risk getting caught. Eleesha tried to kill Chun, Raluca finished pilgred and then gave the final punch to Chun. I grabbed the hacker kit and ran to the bridge. I declared a ceasefire there because I didn't want any violence. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"> But it wasn't even needed, I was able to hack the terminal on my second attempt and took us back to sol. Flawless victory for the mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Final Note</strong> I feel bad about "ruining" what looked like a great ship but it's part of the mush job to do it so... And with so much anti-mush research done quickly it becomes really hard to try to convert more people (specially with so many active people as we had).</p>

                <p>Oh no, I'm not disappointed in you guys, you played your role quite well (except for the suspicious Pilgred bump and the fact that only 5-6 unverified humans ever entered bravo dorm) for the cards you were dealt. If we had killed Eleesha after the sofa debacle then It would've only been a matter of time before we could flush you out, Janice.</p><p>But we humans got too greedy. Pride comes before a fall, and apparently a grumpy Gio who wanted 32 daily AP to spend who the hell knows where <strong>(It was day 3, no crucial part of our ship maintenance was compromised (not hull, O2, Fuel, crew health, research progress, NERON project))</strong> comes first. I had delusions of another 15 human (though with 3 inactives) long ship. His argument, if he comes on to attack the crew (all the vocal active ones were against blanket food testing) for their "stupid roleplay", will likely be that if he were commanding the ship then Eleesha would be dead and Pilgred would be completed on D2. Be that as it may, it's hardly fun to go through food tests for any single person who makes a mistake. Maybe he'll learn a nice lesson about food tests when he gets a triple fungal kitchened banana on a later ship.</p><p>Jin Su out!</p>

                <p>Oh, and Janice, now it makes more sense that you agitated for a "better planet" from Frieda. Frometa had several Illness zones that could have outted you if memory serves correctly. I was just so convinced that Stephen was an Inactive mush (who starts a game on Saturday with Silver and just decides not to play? EXP farmer?) and that Eleesha could be benevolently saved after we pinpointed and killed our inactive mush. Little did I know that Janice who made lovely Neron conversations and worked at least semi-convincingly on NERON and research, would have <strong>Fertile</strong> to elude the most dedicated AP accountants.</p>

                <p>In terms of contingency plans if none of the inactive bronzes were Mush then the most logical 2nd suspect would've been you, Janice. I still had a tiny sliver of reasonable doubt in my stomach from almost killing a Janice on my D27 ship. it was pretty much 90% sure Eleesha was a mush (but i thought there was a 50% chance that she was acting solo) then after that, a little bit of suspicion on Chao (who could've been a very convincing "acting" bronze noobie), and medium suspicion on you, (Jan) and a little bit on Hua. I was hoping to get a planet with either cristalite or more swamps/insects to verify more humans, but you gauged the situation and (because of "busted" investigation channel that you got to spy in on) made the right decision to force Sol when you did.</p>

When he picks his skill, instead of being installed automatically like they used to, the cameras that don't fit into his inventory are just "knocked over". They're visible both on the shelf and on the wall, but they don't work. You have to pick them up and install them.</p>
