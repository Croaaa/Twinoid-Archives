Y'all were a great crew to work with - but had you waited one cycle longer, Frieda, I would have murdered you - and given that I'd already stashed the hacking kit, that would have guaranteed an impact by the asteroids, because the Captaincy wouldn't have moved in time. Damn you!</p><p>It was an interesting game; our Chun was basically an axe murdered and tore a swathe through the ship. Highly entertaining. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Basically, what happened was that Chao and Jin Su flipped me early on Day 4; Chao had been boobytrapping shelves and I ran across two of the things, then Jin Su spiked me while I was poking around in the Refectory. Sloppy of me to be out of the dorms that long, I was wandering the ship looking through the logs. Jin immediately flicked on the Anonymush skill, and nobody was the wiser. Our Alpha Mush weren't subtle enough to be undetected, but they they worked fast, and they worked to a plan. They were more effective than everyone thought they were!</p><p>What I've learned, which I will be keeping in mind for next time, is to be extremely bloody wary of anyone who tells people where to find things. Also, when playing Eleesha, plan moves better. &gt;_&gt;</p><p>I had intended on collecting Paola, but decided to bide my time once I realized that the MycoAlarm research was done. Deploying that gave me a window on Raluca, but I didn't decide to make the call entirely until I knew that a lot of people had passed through her room; Jin spiked her once, then I hit her in Cycle 8 and five minutes later in Cycle 1, then immediately went Anonymush. My intention was to throw suspicion on her due to her not doing much of a job fixing Pilgred, but Chun killed her before I had the chance!</p><p>Anyway, after that I worked to make myself invisible. I've dropped occcasional contaminants in the rations, and spiked people when I could, but with three cameras and five mycoalarms in known locations, my opportunities for spikes were rare. Nonetheless I had Janice at 2 and Paola at 2, and a few people at one - had we made it to D10/C8-D11/C1, I was going to mess with every camera at once, kill Chun and flip two people, and die horribly as people worked me out. I am sad that I didn't get to cause that chaos, but with everyone being careful and hanging out under cameras or alarms, it made my life difficult.</p><p>Still. Love your work, guys, it was a good game. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Jin Su here.<br>I see our new mush pulled through well. Congratulations on ruining those human's game. Janice and Chun, if you read this I would like to point out that Raulca has no reason to not be dirty, and therefore her being dirty isn't suspicious at all. It was a lucky guess. You know what else isn't suspicious? Picking up a gun as we're about to go on an expedition to a planet with potentially hostile creatures. Just putting that out here before you kill a human by accident in a future game.<br>Anyway, I really enjoyed this as my first mush game with other active, competent mush! The crew certainly kept us on our toes, but that stopped being a problem once the head of anti-mush security joined our cause.<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"><br>Trust can be your downfall in Mush. It can also be the only thing that keeps you alive. The hard part is figuring out who is worthy of your trust...</p>

                <p>!Raluca was a less lucky guess than it first looked like, part of the reason I wanted to turn her was that I figured her slow PILGRED progress and constant dirtiness would make her an obvious suspect.</p><p>But man, if Frieda had delayed things one more cycle - I was going to beg her to do so, but I couldn't stick around for Cycle 5 due to RL stuff going on - I could have murdered her.
