                <p>Definitely agreed, and not just because (in the interest of full disclosure) she was my dog and the OP is my fiancee. I understand that people have and will continue to lie about off-ship problems in order to gain an edge. But that doesn't mean you should respond with mockery or insults, because you should be better than the cretins who would do that. Right? We're all human beings, words can cause a lot of harm (or sometimes just a little.)</p><p>Beyond this immediate case, nearly every ship I've been on has had insulting messages posted in general chat or left on end-screens, denigrating others' play as 'stupid.' It's really tiresome.</p>

                <p>The thing is we can't really stop people from being asses, if they have a genuine reason to believe you are mush it isn't likely to be sanctioned unless there was some form of slander (for lack of a better term) involved or there is no clear way for you to have done anything (i.e. you never left a dorm for the time since the so called excuses were made) I was in the middle of a ship when my cat (who was older than me) got hit by a car and I skipped a lot of cycles and in the end was killed by a moronic Kuan who thought the same thing that's happening with you</p><p>The issue is people have their own morals, some will lie about their real lives because there's no way to track it back, this causes trust issues and honestly if someone in our situation had used such a thing I'd be suspicious, but I definitely wouldn't kill over it, other people are less trusting, I've been lied to dozens of times about these 'IRL scenarios" and have honestly lost my sense of sympathy to people in your situations simply because I can't guarantee the truth is what I'm getting. As much as I agree with a change it's unlikely to happen and even if it did I don't think we'd see much actual change</p><p>As for the whole insults left on end pages or general chat: Mush is a game where unless you're playing in a casting, odds are 9/10 ships are going to be utterly disappointing and failures, eventually this stacks up and people get annoyed, this just leads to constant insults and honestly we can't stop humans from being human, people get pissed and they should learn to vent their anger constructively, best thing I can suggest is join a casting</p><p>I may seem inconsiderate, I honestly don't know if what I'm saying will offend you because I'm not too good with sympathy, I always seem to come off as an ass, but I've gone through similar situations and honestly I can't do more than share my opinion on the matter</p>

                <p>You can say this is an unofficial rule, but it's "Don't be a dick."</p><p>Even if it's legal to lie about some RL circumstances, it subsequently makes it harder for people who <em>genuinely</em> have these things happen to them to be believed. "Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me." <strong>Lying</strong> about a sick or recently deceased relative (or pet) for sympathy is <strong>not good gameplay</strong>, and I consider it to fall under "being a dick." - So don't do that. It's an ethical line drawn from the <em>health of the community</em> standpoint, and people shouldn't cross that line just to cover for Mushy behavior.</p><p>The reasons why are obvious: When people have these things actually happen to them, and they tell the truth, they might get killed just because other players lied for sympathy on previous ships. It unnecessarily adds insult to injury, and if the positions were reversed, most of us wouldn't want to deal with people harshly mocking us on top of the loss of a loved one. It's ultimately bad for the playerbase, because I've seen people quit playing other games over similar incidents.</p><p>So, lying about being busy due to work or school is one thing, and most of the playerbase has to deal with one or both of those. There are plenty of other understandable excuses, <em>without</em> having to resort to lying about a pet/relative/etc. Mush CAN lie; hell, they're supposed to lie in order to maintain their cover. It's what they lie <strong>about</strong> that I'm trying to rein in, here.</p><p>I'm <strong>not</strong> saying that these excuses are a guaranteed way to cover for Mush activity, and they <strong>should not be.</strong> I'm also not suggesting that an excuse about a pet or relative must be taken as fact, and provides any form of immunity against being killed. That couldn't be further from the truth.</p><p>What I am saying is: <strong>"Don't be a dick about it, and don't lie for sympathy"</strong>. You may not get sanctioned for lying about something so horrific, but it IS a dick move, and the effects will definitely ripple out to affect other ships. The only effects on the playerbase as a whole are negative, since they bring out unsporting conduct in other players.</p><p>Now, this applies to the human teams: People are <strong>not</strong> supposed to be slinging personal attacks and abuse at each other, and that IS against the rules. <strong>Quit it.</strong> Be on your guard, but be willing to show some compassion as well. If you have to ask yourself why, you've completely missed the point of this post.</p>

                <p><strong>Simpler solution</strong>: don't talk about real life events in-game and don't use them as reasons. Just go inactive if you absolutely have to and tell your crew exactly that if you want to.</p><p>Mookat, I sympathize with the loss of your (fiancé's) pet but I do not sympathize with you and your fiancé's campaign on the forums against this one person that was rude to you (or your death as a Mush). Your evidence of "growing intensity of cold-heartedness and rudeness on every passing ship" is anecdotal at best (to put it mildly), self justifying to your point at worst and not something I can recognize from my own gameplay experience. Yes, people can be rude and they shouldn't be because it often takes away from the fun but as long as they don't break the code of conduct then you should also expect that it's something that's going to happen and not set yourself up to get hurt by it - in my opinion. You're basically asking for a change of the rules because someone was slightly rude to you after killing you for going inactive.</p><p>There's no need to turn this into a "war on dicks".</p>

                <p>Hi Paola. <br>Chun is dead, she hanged herself. <span class="tid_sideNote"><span class="tid_strike">And we're still without oxygen resource.</span></span></p><p>I understand where your anger comes from and I'd probably be raging aswell. <br>But Chun only said <cite>It's shitty to use real life problems as a mush excuse</cite> and that pretty much equals Spazticus "Don't be a dick about it, <em>and don't lie for sympathy</em>" well at least the later part. Alleging you lied under your death message clearly counts as <em>being a dick</em> so I am not going to argue about that. The player should't have said that even if he believes it. Believing being something you can't force someone to. We could argue about whenever his/her killing reason were legit. I am not sure about it. I mean it's common to kill idle Jin Sus to move the commander title but you weren't inactive, just not very active and AP restricted by other means. You never know what exactly brought the people to kill you until you ask, but when you are dead you can't. And I don't know how valid a killing reason has to be - generally people go around killing on hunches more than often. If they are right they act like they knew all along and were 100% sure &amp; if they are wrong everyone else goes "Why the fuck did you do that" even if they secretly planned to do so aswell. But as far as I know bad reasoning is not reportable or I would have reported the Hua two ships ago, which I am glad I didn't because after talking to the player I know that he's actually pretty nice and had better reasons than the completely ridiculous one he mentioned under my death message. I am not trying to say that this Chun had some awesome reasoning, you never did anything mushy so that'd be hard to find. But:</p><p><strong>T</strong>he problem doesn't lie in people lying about personal matters or getting killed because someone is unwilling to believe them, but in a general disrespect for the other team. It's one thing if you couldn't get along with someone the whole time and can't help but dance on their grave (/under their death message). I do that. I mean I unintentionally piss off at least one person per ship and apparently managed to piss off both, you and your fiancé, on different ships for the same reasons. But there are to many people that love to put the blame on those that can't argue back. It's cowardly and vain. If you dislike someone/something tell them right away and if you didn't don't make fun of them afterwards.</p><p>Dead humans get to read how their teammates say that it doesn't really matter since they weren't important - or that they are dumb for failing to save themselves. And dead mush get the whole crap about how bad they were as mush, how uncreative, how boring, how they should have done this or that, bla bla bla.</p>

I'm sorry, Flash (too many with your name and no pic to tag), If you thought I meant this as a personal attack against our Chun, because that wasn't the intent behind it--More so to talk about player conduct, as this was a recent and very raw example. I know you think my example was "anecdotal at best", but I didn't feel a need to go down memory lane over everyone who's been a dick to me, and moments where the shoe is on the foot, because I think most players have experienced this.<br><br>While we could choose not to tell people what's going on in our lives, it feels wrong to me to leave a crew and go radio silent for a day without any explanation whatsoever. I'd rather be able to say, as a person playing a game "real life stuff has come up, i'm so sorry" than just disappear, and hope that people can respect that. Whether you're a mush or human in the game, you're a person behind the screen, and that means mutual respect is in order. <br><br>This isn't something that can be easily enforced in the rules, and I feel for the mods who have to hear about stuff like this when it does come up. It's not just about people who lie about RL situations and those who doubt them, either. It's also just about people critiquing other people's game play. If we could try the following, i think it would greatly help the game, and it's something I'm trying to do myself. We all have bad days, but at least strive for it:<br><br>1) No personal attacks - If a ship decision comes up and someone is trying to do something you don't agree with, tell them why their plan won't work, not that they're stupid or an idiot or (I can't believe I read this on a ship) "retarded" &lt;- Never, ever okay.<br><br>2) Don't lie about real life events. - This makes you a bigger jerk than the person who reacts to them badly. It's bad gameply, as <span class="tid_user tid_user_6826491 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="6826491">Spazticus</span> said. Do better. Learn the game so you can do better.<br><br>3) When someone tells you something is going on in their personal life, give them the benefit of a doubt. - Maybe this makes me a bad mush hunter, but I'd rather be a bad mush hunter who is sad about your sick grandma with you and than a crappy person who assumes your sick grandma is a lie. Use actions in game to make decisions. (NOTE: Our chun told other people in the game that she had evidence in the game against me, and that's great; I was mush and it's good that she caught me, but she didn't have to make unnecessary comments after. Just say WHY you killed someone). <br><br>4) If you kill someone in game, and want to say something about it, just post why you killed them. "Sorry, I noticed you were dirty and you didn't have a reason to be" or "We thought you might be human, but you were interrupting the game play a lot for the other players with some of your actions and you could not communicate".<br><br>5) Don't be afraid to apologize. - We have ALL been dicks at some point in our life, and at some point in the game, myself included. I do have a little temper, and sometimes I say things I regret. When I do, I try to message the other player and apologize. If they're dead, I may apologize on the end screen or send them a Twinoid message. Be a human. Humans make mistakes, but can make up for them. <br><br>thoughts?</p>

                <p>Or, you know, we could call people out on it when they're being rude, instead of taking a stance of 'well yeah this sucks but nothing to be done about it!'</p><p>Personally, when I see rude play, I do try to contact the person directly, usually (if directed at me) in a PM with some sort of 'I feel like you're being rude with ___, maybe we can talk and come to a better understanding,' type of message. Sometimes, if the behavior is getting to me, I have to take a step back before I do it. But I still do it. Sure, it requires effort and sometimes gets a bit of a backlash, but more often than not, if approached reasonably, the other person has a reasonable response. Most of the people playing this game are not trying to be jerks. And if someone doesn't have a reasonable response, well you tried, and then it's time to report and/or walk away depending on the severity.</p><p>Now obviously, the person it's directed at can't really address rudeness if it's on their death message.... but other people can, and should. Just because it is not directed at you does not mean you should wash your hands of any responsibility for saying 'this is not okay.'</p><p>That is how you change things.</p>

                <p>I'm pretty sure there is already a rule for not killing people for this kind of stuff ?</p><p>I've had it happen to one of my ships (evidently I was mush, but could have not been and would have made no difference), where I was killed because I was "inactive". On other ships I was able to say that I cannot connect during c2 to c7, but this one did even give me the time to do it and even said it was the reason for my kill in the discussion thread thing.</p><p>Sadly I suppose the only way is to report the person who did the killing, or at least the one who decided to do it because of it since it is the only thing that can be done. People will be rude and not care, or be completely understanding and emotional, its not a reason to kick you out of the game.</p>
