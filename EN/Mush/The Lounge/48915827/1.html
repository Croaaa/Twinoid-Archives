                <p>Good evening, humans and vampires. This is your resident stowaway, and <strong>not</strong> your resident cook. For the last time, <strong>I am not a chef</strong>. It would be a grave mistake to ask me to prepare even a simple sandwich.</p><p>Anyway... I woke up one fine night on a strange ship, feeling completely frozen and surrounded by strange people. A young woman with pink hair, a grumbling technician with a cat in a foul mood, a <span class="tid_strike">man</span> <span class="tid_strike">woman</span> person waving enthusiastically at the ships firing at us from outside, a gardener wailing about his plants being burnt, an old woman wearing some kind of witch outfit. I also met a fascinating young woman with incredible hair and amazing energy, who immediately dragged me into bed (can't say that I complained, though).</p><p>As we were preparing an expedition on the unknown planet that we were orbiting, we learnt some bad news : two of us were Mush spies. We managed to launch a hastily organized expedition, with Kuan Ti holding the hacker kit, and during which Janice lost her walkie, thus becoming mute for five days.</p><p>Soon after, Jin Su raised the alarm. Eleesha, coming from the lab, had appeared dirty on the bridge. Her reasons were not convincing and, after a few discussions, I was sadly forced to execute my lover. That was our first and only sacrifice to Delzoup, the Goddess of Mush Hunters.</p><p>In the days that followed, we tried to discover who the second mush was, and if they had managed to convert someone, but they were proving elusive. One after the other, the crew members got confirmed. Some people starved, others were ill, and the Xyloph list confirmed five or six people. The mush hunting channel was getting more and more crowded as we kept inviting confirmed humans. Andie, Jin Su, Terrence, then Paola, Frieda, Derek, Ian, inactive Gioele, and finally Hua, Raluca and Kuan Ti. Eventually, only three suspects were left : Roland, Janice... and me, who was starting to feel uncomfortable as the only non confirmed human of the channel. Pheromodem had revealed nothing, so we decided to try our luck with RFS... but on who ? Since Ian was holding the serum and was asleep, we had time to discuss, including the possibility of forcing a food test (or worse, a Natamy test) on the remaining suspects.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">You know, guys, discussing the possible murder of a suspect right in front of him is never a good idea. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></span></p><p>At some point during the night, Janice gave me a fright by going to the lab, where Chun was staying, along with semi-inactive Derek who probably had full AP. Not too subtly, I grabbed a blaster, ran after her, and watched as she quietly relayed research, constantly keeping an eye on her skills and Derek's. Eventually, she went back to bed, and in the morning Andie was able to use RFS on her... and yes, she was our second mush.</p><p>She didn't confirm that there were no other mush left on the ship, though. Interestingly enough, Roland chose that moment to catch an illness, making me the last non confirmed human. I felt some stares and worried glances in my direction, and again demands for food tests were made, which I refused. Unfortunately, Jin Su caught me with a pumpkin head (I rushed to bed so as not to be seen, but it seems I wasn't fast enough), I must say that I was a little disappointed, because I would have loved to keep on the paranoia for a little while. But... oh well, we were officially mush free.</p><p>We dedicated the rest of our trip to finding the starmap fragments, which has rarely been as easy. It took time, but I think that nobody ever got lost on a planet, and we brought an amazing number of jumpkins from the planets we visited. And so, after one last peaceful expedition which gave us three artefacts including the third starmap fragment, here we are, about to start the final trip to Eden.</p><p>Thank you for that ship, everyone. With a special thought to Ian, who died tragically, another victim of the murderous Daedalus, and who would have deserved to come to Eden with us. And to Frieda, my old vampire partner. Another Eden with you ! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">The ship hasn't ended yet, and should go to Eden in about an hour or two. But as I should go to bed, I am already posting the AP thread and will add the link for the ship later. Will also explain the vampire story later, unless Frieda does it before me.</span></p>

                <p>Hello, First-mate, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/jinsu.png" alt=":mush_jin_su_50:" class="tid_ico"> Jin Su here and what a fine AP thread you've created! I'll just go ahead and save you the trouble of looking for the link yourself since I just ended the ship about 20 minutes ago.</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8353" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8353</a></p><p>You have covered the events of the ship pretty well and I have to say that it was quite lucky that I happened to see Eleesha caked in fungus when I did or this ship might not have been such a pleasant ride. One thing <span class="tid_user tid_user_516 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="516">Peanutz</span> didn't mention is about how careful and cooperative our mush hunt team was. Even at the point where we had nearly the entire ship in the chat we all had a voice and say in what happened. We were confirming the humanity of at least one person per day and going over the activities of suspects with a fine toothed comb. Even the night before Janice was cured with the RFS I was in contact with Andie, Ian, and Chun discussing the remaining suspects actions. Particularly I was watching our Stephen's aka <span class="tid_user tid_user_516 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="516">Peanutz</span> movements around the ship and everything he had eaten up till that point. You might not have known it but most of the times you left Bravo dorm I would wait for a bit to check if you were dirty coming back in and grilling you for every detail that you reported so I could check up on it later.</p><p>I really hope that Janice was still playing coy when she said the mush side was boring I'd love to hear the mush perspective in the AP thread. I always enjoy hearing the mush plots and how they manipulated the ship from the shadows. Since Eleesha was killed so early and Janice wasn't able to talk until Brainsync I suppose there wasn't many chance for her to social engineer, but I can still hope for some juicy tidbits.</p><p>Overall I had a blast on this ship and it was a needed change from the murderfest my past few ships had been. The only thing that really bummed me out was once we cured Janice most of the crew forgot how to report important events let alone do some idle chat from time to time. Oh well!! I hope to meet most of this crew on a ship again but maybe next time I'll be part of what is creeping in the shadows... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Raluca here. Sorry I wasn't as active as I could have been. I work best in Mush when there is an immediate situation that requires my attention, such as a broken oxygen tank or a mutant in rc or something. There was so little going wrong while I was on that I eventually got bored and started foc using on real life things. <br>But then we discussed the end of the ship and I decided to become a rebel against the cruel vampire overlords. Really curious to see where that came from by the way.</p>

                <p>Some random ships turn out so great. I was your <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> Janice.<br> The RP on this ship was great from Day One. I had to try to explain to Eleesha that this whole thing wasn't part of her vacation, and when Stephen didn't know about the Daedalus I assumed he had developed amnesia; I had a my work cut out to mentally prepare them for what was to come:<br><cite><br>Stephen : What do you mean, "trip" ? Aren't we on Sol ? <em>Leaves the lab, wanders through the next room with some strange devices, and enters a smaller room with windows. Horrified gasp.</em> But... but we are in space ?</cite><br><cite>Eleesha : <em>laughs </em>Sol! Of course not! <em>straightens herself</em> We are in no other than Floston Paradice you silly!<em> laughs some more</em> I got these tickets here for a fabulous price of 100000 space credits! A bargain I'd say! How did you even got on board? I though room service should be dressed in smoking jackets for such prices.</cite><br><cite>Stephen : Room service ? <em>Straightens himself.</em> Do you even know who I am ? ... Actually, it wouldn't be a good idea for people to know who I am. There are no policemen here, are there ? <em>Coughs.</em> Anyway. I am not from room service. Although I never paid for any space cruise or anything like that. ~20h</cite><br><cite>Janice : Both of you might want to sit down. Yes, we are in the middle of space. Sol is quite some distance away, but I'm sure our captain will have us back there in no time as soon as he wakes up. There's nothing to worry about, you see, the Daedalus is a state-of-the-art ship. It's complete with the finest artificial intelligence ever designed. You're all in safe hands, believe me. We have nothing to worry about, unless the Mush managed to...well actually forget I said anything about them. They've probably forgotten all about us.<br></cite></p><p>And of course within minutes, the two of them couldn't keep their hands of one another. It makes what happened next even sadder! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"><br><cite><br>Eleesha : Oh... Hurts everywhere. That immature butler ... or cook ... or ... that animal was so rude <em>smiles remembering</em> I need a way to take my thoughts away. Are you in AD? I would like to take advantage of you methods.</cite><br><cite>Stephen : Butler ? Cook ?? Now there, I am not a servant. I... actually, I don't remember what my job was. Maybe I didn't even have a precise job, although I know that I'm a very fast learner. But... where was I ? I can't let you talk about me like that. <em>Grins mischievously.</em> I know you liked it, sweetheart. But I won't tell anyone, I promise.</cite><br><cite>Janice : Come here dear, I will see you in Alpha Dorm right away. Tell me where he hurt you. I'm here to help.</cite><br><cite>Janice : As for you Stephen, maybe you'll remember more after some rest. Sleep does wonderful things for the mind.</cite><br><cite>Stephen : HEY ! That's private ! What kind of sick shrink are you anyway ?</cite><br><cite>Janice : Shhh. I know what I'm doing. Sharing her experiences will make Eleesha feel more comfortable, and in time that will make it easier to adjust to her new surroundings.<br>Stephen : I refuse to have her share <strong>our</strong> experiences. That will definitely not make me feel more comfortable.</cite><br><cite>Janice : Come now Stephen, don't you want what's best for her? All my sessions are confidential, you can be assured that all the juicy details will stay between me, her, and my journals.</cite><br><cite>Stephen : <em>Stephen flushes</em> What... I don't... Of course I want what's best for her, but talking to a crazy shrink who wants to hear "juicy details" is not what's best.</cite><br><cite>Eleesha : So here I was, lying there, doing nothing in particular... And then he comes in. And then he does <em>this</em>, and <em>that</em> ... oh, and also <em>this</em> , and I do <em>that</em> ... which is, of course, was only the beginning...</cite><br><cite>Janice : <em>nodding and scribbling furiously</em> A-huh...ooh...goodness...I see. And how did that make you <em>feel</em>?</cite><br><cite>Stephen : And... WHAT ? I did what ? She practically... <em>coughs</em> No. No way. I shall not reveal what really happened.</cite><br><cite>Eleesha : ... <em>lying through her teeth </em>Oh, you know... And then he proposed to me, like they always do. And I refused him, like I always do ...</cite><br><cite>Janice : Marriage! But with his condition? You did the right thing saying no. There could be a Mrs. Stephen somewhere that he can't remember just yet. No one wants to be a homewrecker. Let's talk about homes. Was your childhood home happy? Or could that be the root of your problems with this ship? After all, this is the new home of sorts for all of us.</cite><br><cite>Eleesha : <em>giggles</em> Oh I have a beautiful villa on the outskirts of Silicon Valley, opening a majestic view to the countryside ... <em>falls asleep</em> Very nice... nice place... Zzzzzz.... Home... my... my home.... <em>as Eleesha falls asleep she becomes more serious and seemingly desperate</em> Zzzzzz.... Xyloph 17... Federation crumbles.... Fi... Finola... <em>tears burst through the eyelashes while she completely forgets herself in the sleep</em> </cite><br><cite>Stephen : A Mrs Stephen ? Married, me ? See, there's no ring here. <em>Stephen shows his left hand, then squints at his finger, on which there's a slightly paler band. He shakes his hand.</em> Anyway, I... I don't want to get married.</cite></p><p>But eventually, the ship filled up and....Me and Eleesha were Mush! That was an excellent result, she was Lvl 11 Gold, I was lvl 14 Silver so I felt pretty good about our chances even though we were facing in extremely active crew. Everyone was active and fairly talkative except Gioele and, of course, that Derek. Derek never responded to any of our PMs or talked at all, he only picked a skill (Shooter...) around Day 7. The only person who ever got through to him was Kuan Ti, who told him he was "RPing" and that's why he wasn't communicating at all. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As Stephen already mentioned, something pretty important happened right after Mush Selection, when I lost my Itrakie on our first expedition. Ian had accidentally logged off while holding the Block of Post-its, so we all launched only holding the necessary items...and of course an alien decided he wanted mine. I only brought it out of Mush paranoia; for some irrational reason I wanted to be able to see anything that happened while I was away...it wasn't worth it. Being forced into silence after such a talkative Day 1 had its good and bad, but overall I think it was definitely a hindrance. Sure, no one thought it was weird when I spent most of the game under-the-radar; the few times I went by the Bridge to check up on things were the only times I could hear or speak to the ship. But on the other hand, it meant I had no chance of being part of the Mush hunt, and that ended up being a very important disadvantage. We also lost Frieda in that expedition, so after the expedition I hopped up to the Bridge to report the expo history, and logged off hoping Grandma would be dead when I got back.</p><p>But she survived, and I returned to find the research drive was in full swing, and Mycoalarms, oddly enough, was the first project we wanted completed. Eleesha was using IT points to push it along and appear human. We had decided to more or less take things slow, be cautious. But I pointed out that Jin Su, on the Bridge had a spore. We discussed converting him before the Mycoalarms arrived. Unfortunately, there was a bit of a miscommunication here. I had assumed that Eleesha had already gotten her spores, since she had moving around a lot earlier in the day. But in order to spike Jin Su, she had to extract. Also, she decided she wanted to go for Frieda and have me take Infector in order to do it. In her words, it was because Jin Su "wasn't active enough" (Oh, honey... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> ), but I still I thought that was way a bad use of one of my only 2 skills. So a plan quite a bit different from the relatively safe one I had laid out developed: she extracted in FC, went to the Bridge "to check on Paola's progress", and then spiked Frieda. I was worried when I was able to refresh and see that she was dirty on the Bridge...Jin Su was being talkative in the main chat...I held my breath...but Jin almost immediately reported that Eleesha was dirty on the Bridge. Originally, I was supposed to bring the mycoalarms to the Bridge and convert Frieda before dropping it, but Jin ran to the lab and put in the alarm as soon as he saw Eleesha.</p><p>I knew she was going to be killed at that point, though she did her best to talk her way out of it. I had a plan: Derek had a spore on him, so all she had to do was shower once or twice, use Defacer in AD and then transfer into Derek. That would allow her to disappear for a while and end the immediate danger of her being killed. For some reason, she didn't do it. :/ She said she was low on AP, but then there was a cycle change while she was in a bed so she would have had the 2 AP that was required to transfer, the self-harm was just bonus. I also just realized she was carrying a spore, and could have just used Phagocyte if she needed AP. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> I suppose I never made it clear to her that she was certainly about to die. She said she was chatting with Stephen, so I guess she thought she was convincing him. But there was no way, considering the circumstances of her being clean in the lab and dirty on the Bridge, that anyone as experienced as Peanutz would let her live. After about half an hour into the next cycle, Stephen killed his lover. We wept. Mushovore, Constipaspore, and ASG were all up within a day.</p><p>So I was alone. Eleesha died d2c8, iirc. I survived as a solo Mush until roughly Day 8, Cycle 3. How did I spend my time? What were my plans? Find out soon... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

Honestly bringing the mycoalarm to the bridge only happened because I wanted to check Eleesha's activities. Also Eleesha might have survived considering it took a whole 1 1/2 hours going over every possibly and situation on how she could have gotten dirty. Our Chun, Ian, and Stephen were very oppossed to killing anyone without concrete evidence. What condemned her ultimately is she claimed to have eaten in FC however she had entered the lab several cycles ago with her iTalkie, Scooter, and a ration dropped on the shelf. Reviewing the logs revealed that she never picked the ration back up and infact could not have eaten when she claimed! If I had gotten anymore worked up during the discussion the ship would have started to playing "Pressing Pursuit ~ Cornered" from the Phoenix Wright OST over the loud speakers. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Oh yeah, the mush hunt was really fun, if only a bit tense (those talks about mush tests really annoyed me, and Andie saying that a Natamy test was the same as trying to force someone to eat a jumpkin... well, that's the best one I heard in a long time). But Jin Su is right, it was admirably controlled and careful. We made sure that all confirmed humans stayed that way and knew who the others were, so as to avoid unnecessary murders. At the same time, the mush and the last suspects didn't know just how many people were confirmed. It was lucky, or Janice would have probably jumped into Derek and done some real damage.</p><br><p><cite>Particularly I was watching our Stephen's aka Peanutz movements around the ship and everything he had eaten up till that point. You might not have known it but most of the times you left Bravo dorm I would wait for a bit to check if you were dirty coming back in and grilling you for every detail that you reported so I could check up on it later.</cite> I didn't know exactly how carefully you were watching me, but I knew that you kept watch on the refectory. And I was aware that I had been dirty more than the mush and had been sleeping in BD from the beginning - strange ship, really... Some days I was completely alone in that dorm. Killing Eleesha wasn't complete proof of my innocence, and <strong>maybe</strong> I could have waited until the cured was used on the wrong person. The idea that I could be mush after Janice was cured was preposterous, though, even without her confirmation.</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_7657999 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7657999">1412</span></span><cite>Raluca here. Sorry I wasn't as active as I could have been. I work best in Mush when there is an immediate situation that requires my attention, such as a broken oxygen tank or a mutant in rc or something. There was so little going wrong while I was on that I eventually got bored and started foc using on real life things.</cite><p>Yeah, the ship went almost too smoothly for a long while. It took a little... ahem... insisting and grumbling to get people to understand how to stay safe, but otherwise, the crew was remarkably active. I didn't even know which skill to take with Apprentice, since we had all the ideal skills (three astros, two techs, three morale sources, three potential diplomats, and I don't even know how many pilots).</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8035782 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8035782">HoboNixon</span></span><cite>I really hope that Janice was still playing coy when she said the mush side was boring I'd love to hear the mush perspective in the AP thread. I always enjoy hearing the mush plots and how they manipulated the ship from the shadows. Since Eleesha was killed so early and Janice wasn't able to talk until Brainsync I suppose there wasn't many chance for her to social engineer, but I can still hope for some juicy tidbits.</cite><p>To be honest, she didn't have much room for plots and manipulations. For one thing, being mute for five days didn't help. And then, the crew was way too active for a solo mush. Bravo Dorm was closely watched, mycoalarms were done fast enough to cover the unprotected areas, the other research were finished pretty fast too, including pheromodem... of which Janice was warned in advance, since people couldn't help announced its progress in public. I'll never understand that... "Hey, mush, we're going to access your channel soon, so please stop talking and acting, so that we find nothing". Anyway, apart from transferring to Derek or sabotaging the cure, there wasn't much to be done. As for conversion, it was almost impossible.</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1833769 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1833769">Ferhago</span></span><cite>I suppose I never made it clear to her that she was certainly about to die.

As Jin Su said, Ian, Chun and I wanted to make sure that she couldn't have got dirty between the bridge and the lab, and we were about to make a decision when Chun voiced some doubts about vending machine food. That made us hesitate a little, but basically Eleesha was dead the minute she was spotted dirty. She tried well, though. I particularly liked the way she tried to worm out of confiding to Andie, saying that if he was mush, he could easily change the actions revealed. But all in all, there was very little doubt about letting her live.</p><p>(Why did you remind me of that, Janice ? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico">)</p>

                <p>Hello everyone! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":tid_smile:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"> Eleesha here, to brag about a terrible room service, stolen luggage, and rude lackeys that punch you to death.</p><p>Basically Janice told a great story, and because my trip was so short, I'll just add a few things.</p><p>First of all it was a very fun and pleasant experience, crew was very nice and almost everyone on this ship was friendly and helpful. I loved how Terrence and Ian punched in to support our RP with <span class="tid_user tid_user_516 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="516">Peanutz</span> and <span class="tid_user tid_user_1833769 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1833769">Ferhago</span>. And I particularly enjoyed <span class="tid_user tid_user_7657999 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7657999">1412</span> as Raluca, that did her ropelay perfectly. We had a very nice Paola and surprisingly aggresive Andie, which was a nice addition to overall friendly crew. I want to apologize to <strong>Chun</strong>, with who I kept a channel opened at all times and acted human, sharing "investigation" with her. I'm not sure she was keen to be deceived, but she surely was happy to receive some guidance, and in the end, it was from mush. I want to mention that all advice were real, and they are valid in case I was human as well. Thank you for the nice game everybody!</p><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_1833769 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1833769">Ferhago</span><br><cite>she decided she wanted to go for Frieda and have me take Infector in order to do it. In her words, it was because Jin Su "wasn't active enough" (Oh, honey... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> ), but I still I thought that was way a bad use of one of my only 2 skills. So a plan quite a bit different from the relatively safe one I had laid out developed</cite>It was a different case. Just a moment before we went with the plan, I was contacted by Frieda in private message, I knew she was online, and thus could be immediatly helpful as mush partner, because we were on a verge of securing the Bridge with alarm. We were planning to convert a Bridge inhabitant on cycle change, but Jin was going to move the ship and leave next cycle. So Janice would have no opportunity to spike him, because she had no spores either, and had to go out to the lab and return to get alarm as an excuse. She would also be dirty there, so she would have to come back to the dorm immediately. By that time I assumed Jin would leave to the Bridge. This was the primary reason I chose to convert Frieda instead of Jin. I have to admit that decision was indeed rushed by me, it was hasty and obscene to rush into the Bridge dirty with active <span class="tid_user tid_user_8747164 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8747164">Komachi</span> and <span class="tid_user tid_user_8035782 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8035782">HoboNixon</span> in there. But I guess the point is, it was a bad idea to plan any of us going to the Bridge dirty with such active crew, non of which was safe.</p><p><cite>I had a plan: Derek had a spore on him, so all she had to do was shower once or twice, use Defacer in AD and then transfer into Derek. That would allow her to disappear for a while and end the immediate danger of her being killed. For some reason, she didn't do it. :/ She said she was low on AP, but then there was a cycle change while she was in a bed so she would have had the 2 AP that was required to transfer, the self-harm was just bonus. I also just realized she was carrying a spore, and could have just used Phagocyte if she needed AP. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> </cite></p><p>You forgot I explained that before entering the dorm with Stephen I took splashproof, so that I wouldn't flash red while taking a shower right in front of active Stephen. That was before I knew I was spoted. So I couldn't possibly lower my health with a shower. But I could have done it with my tracker. But since I was actively chatting with Chun, Fireda and Stephen they would have noticed I dropped it.<br>Another thing that I mentioned in our mush chat, was that with 2 skills already selected (<em>splashproof</em> and <em>fertile</em>) I needed 2 slots to take <em>defacer</em> and <em>transfer</em> to cover my tracks in the dorm, there was no room for phagocyte. I needed 2 ap with Ian in the dorm to transfer and 2 ap to deface and I needed to go to the Lab and take a cat, making sure not to drop the walkie and lower my health without suspition. And I didn't have even those required to transfer. All I could do, is try to convince Stephen and everyone not to kill me immediately and win time for cycle change. (which happened actually, but Stephen took me down before I logged back <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":tid_razz:" class="tid_ico">)</p><p><cite>I suppose I never made it clear to her that she was certainly about to die.</cite>Good thing you didn't have to do that. I wouldn't offered you a last resort plan to convert Stephen under camera, convert another one immediately, and ceasefire the dorm (we had 3 diplomat skills in our possession after all and I knew weapon locations) if I wasn't sure I would die. But at that point you convinced me that we can save myself "without you moving a finger and exposing yourself" by doing that transfer/deface plan. You were actually right in the end. I did lived until cycle change. Just failed to log in time.</p><p>It was disappointing for me to find out that you were indeed inoculated, exactly how I told you would happen, if you stall. But I still take the blame for mush failure, because I died first, leaving my partner in a difficult situation, alone, against a competent crew, with powerful research unlocked. I hope we can do it again sometime, and have a glorious mush win together <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=":tid_clink:" class="tid_ico"> Oh, and now when I saw who you are, I remembered our fun game with me mush and you Chao! It was a great dance we had.</p><p>And thank you again for the game, everybody. Pity I can't really discuss anything happening after day 2. Happy Eden, humans.</p>

I hope you don't think I was being too harsh in that last post, I really was just sad to see a good partner go so early.</p><p>But I did promise to explain what I did following Eleesha's untimely demise, so here we go:<br> After Eleesha was killed, the humans quickly started doing Mushovore, and the other core researches. Paola, who was playing her first game but doing an incredible job, unlocked Finola's List and instantly confirmed just about half the remaining people on the ship as humans - including some who might have never been confirmed otherwise. I knew Pheromodem wasn't going to be far behind, and all the humans had <em>at most</em> one spore. Jin had 1, Frieda and Hua had 1, and most importantly, Derek had 1. Derek was confirmed by Finola's List as human, so in spite of him being next to useless, everyone had to let him be. He idled most of the day, didn't communicate, had no skills...he was exactly what I needed. <br> I had never extracted any spores, or visited BD. This left me in a rather decent position following Eleesha's death to try and stay under the radar. I ate when I needed to, taking a banana on D4 and fake-eating a ration on D7. I visited the Bridge once a day or so and tried to use people in AD as mediums so that the crew could contact me for morale. I saw this as the best play in a tough situation. Things might have been very different if I hadn't lost that Itrakie. It shut me out completely of the mush investigation; if that hadn't happened, I would have at least tried to join up with Stephen (who I naturally expected to have been leading the hunt) and essentially try to do what he did - slowly cross out suspects until there were only a handful left...and me. He contacted me once some time in the middle stages to explain why he was moving in and out of Bravo Dorm so frequently, so he was clearly prepared for that. Nevertheless, even after I was cured a few people were still nervous about him, so it seems like it would have been an even more interesting game if I just hadn't been muted.<br> But I had to play with the hand I was dealt. Knowing I was just one Shrink against 12 competent humans, it was going to take a lot of luck for me to pull out a win. I needed to wait for "the right time" or else I expected the humans to be strong enough to bounce back from losing even four or five people. I had two advantages: A. I was a Diplomat; after my initial attack, I could declare a Ceasefire, to rest and prepare for a second attack B. I was carrying a <strong>Diplomat</strong> Mage Book, which meant that after I transferred into Derek I could attack and then rest up again for a third strike. C. Eleesha revealed the location of the Grenade (although I never did find out where the knife ended up), and there was a Grenade BP in Bravo Dorm. Even with all this in my corner, I didn't think I could win without the humans starting at a health disadvantage. I wanted to kill two or three humans with Grenades, in addition to killing Stephen <em>first</em>, before I took my first break. It was ambitious, but I needed to inflict major damage in my first body for this to work. The only way this damage would reliably happen was from an expedition. But the humans had a great stroke of luck on those. We found a Jumpkin on the very first trip, which meant we had a full Garden up in record time and stopped looking for food/fruit planets. Secondly, our Astros for a long time had trouble finding planets with artifacts and our expedition rate slowed down significantly. We only did 9 expeditions the entire journey, and <em>two</em> of them were to the planet we started at! Being muted made once again became a headache, because I couldn't predict <em>when</em> we would end up at a planet or when the expedition would be over. We had LBU, so I could swoop in right after it ended and let the grenades fly. But until Day 7 (getting that base took a while) I couldn't know when to move! Even after we got the base, our next expedition didn't take place until after I was cured. Since expeditions were looking less and less viable, my next best hope was to wait for late-game events to start hurting <em>everyone</em>. That wasn't a great option, seeing as Derek would probably get healed from that damage the least out of anyone. I was going to have a less-then-perfect new body. But this was the option I was relying on when I noticed the cure was 70% done. It stalled at 70% for quite a while, until I signed on early Day 8 and saw that we had finally finished it. <em>Now</em> I had to act. I ran to the lab to see where the cure had gone, and found that Ian was holding it. Stephen showed up literally right behind me, and we both put on a smile while we relayed some minor research project. From private conversations, I figured that Raluca was the other suspect. All I could do was remind them that Raluca had never asked me for any comforting and that I hadn't seen her since before selection, but then I was still asked to comfort her anyway. Curious, I stopped by the Nexus and saw that Ian hadn't been by - probably a good indication that she hadn't been cured. But that also meant the only thing I could do was go back to bed. Even if I had started attacking, Ian was never going to be a target of mine; there would have been no way for me to get the cure from him. I would just be pathetically ruining someone else's game and I would <em>still</em> lose as soon as Ian showed up. All I could do was hope they cured her in the morning, that I somehow wasn't killed right after they realized she had been human all along, and wait. But the next time I signed in, Andie had cured me. I expected at least a pop-up, but there was just a brief log entry three cycles back letting me know it was over. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br> Then I found out that Raluca was confirmed human thanks to starvation right about the time they finished the cure, and that the choice of the serum was actually between me and <em>Roland</em>. Apparently they went with a "Cure One, Kill the Other" approach, and they chose to cure their Shrink. Both Roland and Stephen were proven human within a day or so, but if I had somehow made it another day, I think the random events started to get severe enough that an attack might have worked. I've always wondered what a Mush rampage late in the game, after Day 10 or so, would look like, but I'll have to wait some more to find out. There was still some a little bit of fun RP after my demise, especially one-on-one with Stephen. But unfortunately I didn't know that even if you have the game open in another window the game doesn't load older message after you confirm your last words, so I lost a lot if it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"> I did get some of the vampire stuff though:<br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/OhFr2In.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/OhFr2In.png</a><br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/mnUy36H.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/mnUy36H.png</a><br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/kXsAU9m.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/kXsAU9m.png</a><br>And of course, there was this little moment.

                <p>It was a nice Freudian slip, yeah. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Ah, that scene in the lab, both of us politely passing the apron and exchanging about research over a cup of tea, while wondering who was going to shoot first... I am still mad at Andie, though. He had the nerve to whine that "we waste time, it's horrible" because we were having that maddening discussion about mush tests, but actually the only reason we were wasting time was because Ian was holding the serum. And he was holding it because our genius of an Andie had decided to finish RFS in advance, forcing us to keep if safe. If he had listened to us, then he could have finished it at the right moment and we would have cured you immediately.</p><p>But then we wouldn't have had that interesting meeting in the lab. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And we wouldn't have had that... ahem... "fascinating" debate about mush tests, in which I learned a lot of interesting things, for example that forcing someone to eat a jumpkin isn't a food test, or that a Natamy test is the same as a food test. I don't think I'm going to miss that Andie...</p>
