                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1895">The End</a></p><p><strong>I'm sorry if this story/ap is badly written, I just want to write about this, in hope that one of the others will see it, because I would like to know who the active players were.</strong></p><p>I'm probably not going to be able to do this story justice, as it is my very first time waking up on the Daedalus. I was Frieda Bergmann this game, it was actually the only character I got to choose on my first ship and I enjoyed trying to make the best of it.</p><p>The <strong>first few cycles</strong> were very strange. I'm going to say that we were lucky, because what I can only think of as inexperience in the game, <strong>Gioele</strong> triggered some sort of mutation and made it very obvious that he was <strong>mush</strong> and it was quickly announced on the walkie-talkies, <strong>Eleesha</strong> dealt with him and we were already having a nice start. Unless you count the fact that in this game we had quite a few inactives. I think Eleesha took some lethal damage, because she bled to death in a few cycles/days.</p><p>A little later Raluca commits suicide, I'm guessing she couldn't stand the company she was with.</p><p>Roland starved to death.</p><p>Paola said "Hi" in russian, stood on the bridge all alone for a few days/cycles and then saw no meaning in life and got lost in depression as her morale waned.</p><p>I don't remember just how many days and cycles, but research and neron upgrades along with Sol just went nowhere. I think most actively Ian and Finola worked in the laboratory and tried to get us some needed anti-mush things. Antispore Gas and Constatipaspore Serum (?) later got researched much thanks to them I believe.</p><p>Stephen who was braindead, stood in the central corridor, only staring at the door to the refectory. It must have been something in his history preventing him from entering the kitchen, perhaps his chefskills wouldn't cut it for this crew? He must have had anxiety over preparing the best space-food possible, because he just stood there silently, not moving a muscle. In comes Chao, guns blazing and makes Stephen easily fit into a shoe-box. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"> Neron announced the death of our ship's chef and Chao simply took his walkie-talkie to his mouth and whispered "sorry for party-rocking".</p><p>The old lady I was I couldn't sleep easily when there was a psychopath roaming the halls murdering innocents, so we decided to take care of him. Hua, the <strong>Queen Bee</strong>, buzzed over and stung him down. I felt a lot safer after that, he was not mush but we didn't really care - he might as well have been, he hadn't killed someone for so long and we were unsure how many more he'd take with him.</p><p>This entire game we were struggling with hunters, evading them by trying to move the ship, I scanned quite a few planets and gave a lot of information, basically where all my AP went. In the end, decisions took a long time, and I had to personally talk to Jin Su that if he doesn't do anything, we have to deal with him. He sprung into action and all of a sudden we started moving the ship.</p><p>I titled this thread with my "before end-game" thoughts. I had been thinking for a long while how Janice was inactive, she had been given the Neron Admin and Comms title. I thought about who of the 8 others left could be the mush, and it dawned upon me that it must be her. I had a private conversation with Hua and Terrence and said, Janice is my #1 suspect and here are the reasons. No upgrades done, no communication with Sol done and she doesn't seem to utilize her awake time to anything beneficial, yet she scurries away sometimes from the dorms.</p><p>Just about 5 minutes later she attacks me, trying to lower my morale. Luckily I was at full morale, but she took me down quite a bit. I panicked and started shouting in my walkie-talkie to my good shipmates Hua and Terrence, as well as broadcasted that <strong>it's on Queen Mush</strong>, you're going to die. The camera caught everything! Ian later checked the dorm and saw, yes, it was true and broadcasted a confirmation.</p><p>The last few cycles, I had no energy left, I couldn't even move. So when I did get points I ran after Janice, Hua kindly gave me a banana to help me in the fight, and in the end I fought the Queen Mush in the refectory, I nabbed the coffee and tried punching her a few times. Sadly it was like trying to hit a mongoose, I kept missing and wasted so much energy. She got away from me and I never caught her. I took a nap in the refectory, and later in the Alpha Dorm.</p><p>What I didn't know was, I thought Janice was the Queen Mush since the start, but learning afterwards, Kuan Ti was the Alpha Mush. He had gone under the radar, well played, I mean, he was suspected because he was reported dirty and hurt a few times and his replies never really added up, he was caught early to not report why he was dirty. But, he crept under the radar anyway.</p><p>Jin Su had been mushed, which wasn't a total surprise to me, but I couldn't confirm his fungi-ness. It might have been why threats got him into action changing the ships heading, because we would have had to kill him if he didn't move the ship.</p><p>While I was asleep, our ship was torn apart by hunters. We had so many things that needed to be repaired, and eventhough Terrence pulled the weight of ten men repairing things, he could not keep up being almost entirely alone on repairing the ship.</p><p>I wish to thank Hua and Terrence especially, but I really enjoyed the company of all the active players this game, very well played Kuan Ti and Ian. Janice, I wish I could have dealt with your mushy face, but now I'm hyped towards my next game and hope some of you guys see this and can comment.</p><p>An honor playing with you all, thanks for a great first game! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></p>
