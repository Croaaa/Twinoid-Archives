                <p>- - <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5707" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5707</a> - -</p><p>Janice here,</p><p>Thank you all for this great ship. You can't know how happy I am that after all that, we found the last starmap piece at the very last possible moment and managed to crank out the starmap calculations! You are all glorious golden gods. I may or may not have started out this ship forgetting how to pick up Schroedinger mid relay while drunk. <a href="http://aberrantentity.com/mu-jk-herekittykitty-rs.png" target="_blank">http://aberrantentity.com/mu-jk-herek...</a></p><br><p>The ship started typically enough. Usually I don't wait for mushday Sundays, but I'm so glad I got placed in this ship! I could not have asked for better. Raluca was really active at the start, though she had to go a bit more quiet for reasons - I hope all goes well for you there, dear.</p><p>Getting into the voyage, the rest of the crew landed gold with Gioele getting caught very soon. As Janice, I was pretty much insulated from the main mush hunt, up until the point Derek did some weird things to make me panic and invite some random people in<a target="_blank" href="http://aberrantentity.com/mushhunt-mmm.txt">.</a> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> The chat sort of snowballed from there into a long, continual discussion over who was doing what, who was confirmed, and who would slowly be invited in.</p><p>Eventually, our other mush, Frieda, was pretty screwed, and I feel for her. While we were discussing our few remaining crewmembers we weren't sure about, she took anonymush around the same time she did her daily rounds - and I happened to notice it right away.</p><p>At that point, we were still not sure between three people - Kuan Ti, Eleesha and Frieda. Though the timing indicated it was probably Frieda, I couldn't be sure if I just hadn't noticed the anonymush getting taken at some earlier point. We ended up Natamy rifling KT and eleesha to prove them human and punish them for their inactivity <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"> .</p><p>So, with Frieda the sole remaining mush so far as we could figure, she was given the cure and we were on our way</p><p><strong>THE POST MUSH HUNT GAME</strong></p><p><em>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</em></p><br><p>Our luck in the post game was so brutal Andie and myself at least were both ready to take a long vacation from Mush after this ship was over. We found something like 6 Alien TV's for artifacts and lost three very dedicated crew mates in 3 seperate MIA's - Jin Su, Hua and then Paola. Every time someon got lost, they got buried under rocks.</p><p>A quiet sense of ennui settled over the ship, and eventually we were all going through the motions with little hope we would find anything before going to Sol. There was much discussion about going to sol, but in the same expo that Paola was lost, on day 15.4, we found our first starmap piece.</p><p>That faint glimmer kept us going. After losing Frieda to something or other, I scanned a planet and found one with cristalite. This happily earned us our second piece.</p><p>Finally, we were stoked - there was a chance. Though everything was falling apart and on fire, we tried for a few more planets. My second planet didn't land us anything very useful, but as a final plunge into the fray, Stephen blind scanned a planet and discovered cristalite - and we decided to expo it. Me, Andie and Stephen headed below. After downing a Skinner, I earned the ire of the pack, and three successive predators hunted me down and tore me to pieces.</p><p>But not all was lost. The rest of the expo saw many dangers, from the sound of it, but at last, at the very last, they found their last cristalite piece. They must have had to rush the calculator, and then take the journey to Eden. They had done it.</p><p>Well done, my friends. I hope to see you all again out there sometime soon!</p>

                <p>Alright, I was Stephen. Let me just post my diaries.</p><p><strong>The Prelude</strong><br>Our escape to an unknown quadrant in the hope to buy time to finish the anti-mush research did not go unnoticed by the Mush Collective. We suspect that at least TWO crew were converted to the Mush. As we went around our daily tasks, I am relieved that only Roland appears to have suffered permanent brain damage from the cryogenic freeze.</p><p>We had a flying start with Raluca, our resident Genius completing Plasma Shields on D1C1 itself. Our crack team of Ace Pilots consisting of Hua, Terrence, Andie and our Commander Jin Su made short work of any Hunters that were buzzing around. The gardens were well tended with Ian and Chun helping out. And Terrence and Raluca were acting as our Techs. Paola was an excellent Comms Officer whilst Janice made sure we kept our sanity.</p><p>As for me, I was lazying around helping where I could. Mainly, I was an apprentice to Andie and learnt his 3-in-1 skill which would serve me well in days to come. Both Andie and I, together with Ian focus on anti-mush research. The Nexus projects lagged a little behind, but was still fine.</p><p><strong>Opening Act 1: The Mush Hunt (D1~D4)</strong><br>The question was ~ who was the MUSH? It was quiet, too quiet... and we were all starting to get edgy. Then, we had a lucky break. Chun somehow had a premonition that Gioele had done something suspicious. When he accidentally brushed by her, she had a flash of insight that he was an infected Mush. Rallying the crew, he quickly had him eliminated. And it was correct. We were estatic that we had killed the Mush but who was his partner?</p><p>Tensions mounted as hours went by. Everyone was expecting the Mush partner to out himself and go berzerk but... Instead, this Mush was a cunning one. A day passed and the agony was unbearable. Tempers flared up between the crew for the smallest of infractions. Even though we had taken out the first Mush, somehow it made things worst. As if the last Mush was taunting us...</p><p>The Lab research team decided we would focus on Mycoscanner to test the crew. As we feared, we found Eleesha had been infected with a spore. She was at the Nexus alone, so it made sense she could have been spored. The other possibility was she was a Mush herself trying to pull a wool over our eyes. The only other person that was dirty was Kuan Ti. Acting very erratically, he went to both the Nexus (whilst Eleesha was there) and the Engine room. He came back dirty and showered at Bravo Dorm.</p><p>Our last suspect was Frieda. Although she was an ancient crone, surely she could have done better work in Astro scanning? However, she had never left the Bridge and we deemed her the lowest priority.</p><p>Finally, we completed our Pheromodem hack, which gave us access to the Mush records. Unfortunately, there was only a chilling taunting message when we finally deciphered it. I cannot remember the exact words, but I remember the CHILLS up my neck when I read it.<br><strong>"<em>IT IS SO LONELY HERE. DON'T WORRY, I'LL STRIKE AT THEM WHEN THEY LEAST EXPECT IT!</em>"<br></strong><br>Paranoia increased triple-time. All active and willing crew members were subject to our special dietary test to ensure they were not Mush. In the end, our only suspects were Eleesha, Kuan Ti and Frieda. The lab team worked triply hard to complete our highly experimental MUSH CURE. We had to find out the Mush to administer the cure. Not only was this important for us, but it was for the whole of Humanity. A mass manufacture of a working and tested cure would do wonders for the struggling Rebel Bases on SOL.</p><p>As we were debating, the last Mush acted up again, pretending to give up and asking for a cure. IT then took Anonymush, thus nullifying our ability to determine whether he had successfully identified and cured the last Mush using the RETRO FUNGAL SERUM aka MUSH CURE. At the same time, Frieda became active, went to the Refectory and took out the Refrigerator and dropped it at Bravo Bay. And went back to the Bridge again? Coincidence? Did she trap the Refrigerator? What the hell was she up to? We were all extremely tense at her erratic behaviour.</p><p>We finally hit on the plan to use the Natamy Rifle on our 3 fellow crew members. The extent of their injuries would give them away, as to whether they were infected. Kuan Ti at the Bravo Dorm was tested first and he passed the test. Although we healed him again, he suffered grevious injuries both in body and mind and soon passed away. Next up, Eleesha and Frieda, both at the Bridge. Long story short, Eleesha was not mush and she got a broken foot courtesy of the Natamy Rifle. We then ganged up on Frieda and injected the RFS into her body.</p><p>SHE FOUGHT WITH A SAVAGERY beyond her years. She scratched, screamed, threatened us, kicked, yelled, elbowed and used every trick in the book. When we finally subdued her, she begged, cried, pleaded for mercy promising that she was not Mush. All in vain. With the injection, she lost control over her body. All manner of noxious and indescribable fluids leaked out of every orifice of her body.

                <p>Heya, Andie here. This ship was not in Lady Luck's good books, but we prevailed. As the sole person who was found after getting lost on an expo, I have to say I don't think I've ever been so stressed out by this game... in a good way. Where other ships usually quit and go to Sol, we soldiered on and it sucks that we lost so many people (especially Janice right at the end). At any rate, I'm sure it was an interesting sight in Eden; a burning, broken ship filled with an exhausted crew.<br>P.S. Looking forward to the end of your script, Stephen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p><strong>AGAINST ALL ODDS!</strong></p><p>Alright, I was Stephen. Let me just post my diaries.</p><p><strong>The Prelude</strong><br>Our escape to an unknown quadrant in the hope to buy time to finish the anti-mush research did not go unnoticed by the Mush Collective. We suspect that at least TWO crew were converted to the Mush. As we went around our daily tasks, I am relieved that only Roland appears to have suffered permanent brain damage from the cryogenic freeze.</p><p>We had a flying start with Raluca, our resident Genius completing Plasma Shields on D1C1 itself. Our crack team of Ace Pilots consisting of Hua, Terrence, Andie and our Commander Jin Su made short work of any Hunters that were buzzing around. The gardens were well tended with Ian and Chun helping out. And Terrence and Raluca were acting as our Techs. Paola was an excellent Comms Officer whilst Janice made sure we kept our sanity.</p><p>As for me, I was lazying around helping where I could. Mainly, I was an apprentice to Andie and learnt his 3-in-1 skill which would serve me well in days to come. Both Andie and I, together with Ian focus on anti-mush research. The Nexus projects lagged a little behind, but was still fine.</p><p><strong>Act 1: The Mush Hunt (D1~D4)</strong><br>The question was ~ who was the MUSH? It was quiet, too quiet... and we were all starting to get edgy. Then, we had a lucky break. Chun somehow had a premonition that Gioele had done something suspicious. When he accidentally brushed by her, she had a flash of insight that he was an infected Mush. Rallying the crew, he quickly had him eliminated. And it was correct. We were estatic that we had killed the Mush but who was his partner?</p><p>Tensions mounted as hours went by. Everyone was expecting the Mush partner to out himself and go berzerk but... Instead, this Mush was a cunning one. A day passed and the agony was unbearable. Tempers flared up between the crew for the smallest of infractions. Even though we had taken out the first Mush, somehow it made things worst. As if the last Mush was taunting us...</p><p>The Lab research team decided we would focus on Mycoscanner to test the crew. As we feared, we found Eleesha had been infected with a spore. She was at the Nexus alone, so it made sense she could have been spored. The other possibility was she was a Mush herself trying to pull a wool over our eyes. The only other person that was dirty was Kuan Ti. Acting very erratically, he went to both the Nexus (whilst Eleesha was there) and the Engine room. He came back dirty and showered at Bravo Dorm.</p><p>Our last suspect was Frieda. Although she was an ancient crone, surely she could have done better work in Astro scanning? However, she had never left the Bridge and we deemed her the lowest priority.</p><p>Finally, we completed our Pheromodem hack, which gave us access to the Mush records. Unfortunately, there was only a chilling taunting message when we finally deciphered it. I cannot remember the exact words, but I remember the CHILLS up my neck when I read it.</p><p><strong><em>"IT IS SO LONELY HERE. DON'T WORRY, I'LL STRIKE AT THEM WHEN THEY LEAST EXPECT IT!"</em><br></strong><br>Paranoia increased triple-time. All active and willing crew members were subject to our special dietary test to ensure they were not Mush. In the end, our only suspects were Eleesha, Kuan Ti and Frieda. The lab team worked triply hard to complete our highly experimental MUSH CURE. We had to find out the Mush to administer the cure. Not only was this important for us, but it was for the whole of Humanity. A mass manufacture of a working and tested cure would do wonders for the struggling Rebel Bases on SOL.</p><p>As we were debating, the last Mush acted up again, pretending to give up and asking for a cure. IT then took Anonymush, thus nullifying our ability to determine whether he had successfully identified and cured the last Mush using the RETRO FUNGAL SERUM aka MUSH CURE. At the same time, Frieda became active, went to the Refectory and took out the Refrigerator and dropped it at Bravo Bay. And went back to the Bridge again? Coincidence? Did she trap the Refrigerator? What the hell was she up to? We were all extremely tense at her erratic behaviour.</p><p>We finally hit on the plan to use the Natamy Rifle on our 3 fellow crew members. The extent of their injuries would give them away, as to whether they were infected. Kuan Ti at the Bravo Dorm was tested first and he passed the test. Although we healed him again, he suffered grevious injuries both in body and mind and soon passed away. Next up, Eleesha and Frieda, both at the Bridge. Long story short, Eleesha was not mush and she got a broken foot courtesy of the Natamy Rifle. We then ganged up on Frieda and injected the RFS into her body.</p><p><em>SHE FOUGHT WITH A SAVAGERY</em> beyond her years. She scratched, screamed, threatened us, kicked, yelled, elbowed and used every trick in the book. When we finally subdued her, she begged, cried, pleaded for mercy promising that she was not Mush. All in vain. With the injection, she lost control over her body. All manner of noxious and indescribable fluids leaked out of every orifice of her body. It was a nightmare to watch, but over a course of an hour, she finally stopped trashing. We cleaned up as best we could and put Frieda to rest on the sofa at the Bridge. She was still breathing. In the next few hours, she finally talked. <strong>We were MUSH FREE!</strong></p><p>With full shields, a crew of 14 people all semi active, it seems that Eden would be easily within our grasp. Our would it?</p>

                <p><strong>Act 2: The Excruciating Expeditions (D5-D10)</strong><br>Upon eliminating the Mush, things were looking so bright. Ah~ the inexperience of youth. The joyful and unabashed doe eyed days that I will never experience again... these brings tears to my eyes.</p><p>As second-in-command, I looked up to the Great Strate-Guru Jin Su. In my eyes, our Commander was an all-knowing consummate God. Oh ~how wonderful was he? Let me count the ways:</p><p>1. A great Leader ~ he had the potential to comfort all of us during great distress but did not deem it necessary to do so, leaving this role to Janice, knowing full well they were both capable of doing so.</p><p>2. Logistics Expert ~ just being in the presence of the great man, made everyone feel able to do more. In fact, it was more than a feeling at times. I was able to do more at times whilst he was beside me.</p><p>3. Strateguru ~ oh, the way he was able to do the tiny delicate adjustments in the way points, coax the engine into erratic behavious prior to our warp jumps and delicately scramble the enemy software gave me goose bumps. We lead several enemy Hunters into jumping into a fiery Sun that way without firing a shot.</p><p>With him firmly in Command, I sunk into a deep sense of comfort and we went about our tasks with admirable efficiency. All critical lab research was done quickly with minimal fuss especially the Super Soaper and Meridon Scrambler. Our Nexus projects went along swimmingly and we completed all the major projects like GPU, Trail Minimizer, O2 ducts, Fire Detector and Plasma Shields.</p><p>On the Gardening side, Ian had great luck. With his green thumb, our Nexus projects ~ Hydrophonics Incubator, Extra Hydropots and Heat Lamps, we had more fruits that what we knew what to do with. Plenty of fruits went to waste, those early days.</p><p>As we went with our expeditions, we did not have the best of luck. All our expeditions at Crystalite zones were met with Mush ambushes where we got spored many a times. With our diplomats, all the Intelligent Civilizations gifted us were mainly TVs (4 in total?). We were lucky and got a Magellan Liquid Map and two alien boulders. However, what we needed were Starmaps. But then our Nightmare started...</p><p><strong><em>#Jin Su</em></strong><br>On one of our early expeditions post Mush, we lost Jin Su in a freak accident. He went missing on a zone. We thought we'd find him easily but our expedition team found him alright, dead! In our distraught, we buried him with the tools he took, namely the drill. With our fuel only at 20, how could we replenish our fuel to continue our journey? It was a disaster in all respects.</p><p>The mantle of Command weighed heavily on me... sigh.<br><strong>SALUTE TO COMMANDER JIN SU ~ ONE OF THE BEST LEADERS EVER!</strong></p><p><strong><em>##Hua</em></strong><br>His death spurred on our fiery spirit to carry on and reach Eden in his memory. With this in mind, we once again furiously went on in search for the Starmaps so critical in our search for Eden. Hua's perky behaviour cheered us up tremendously. However, on another so-called benign planet, Hua went missing. You must understand we were FRANTIC with worry. Yet another missing expedition team mate! How could this happen. We frantically searched for Hua but found her dead. Our sprits sunk.</p><p><strong><em>###Paola</em></strong><br>With the loss of Hua, we had to call for reinforcements. This came in the form of our beautiful Paola, determined to reach Eden and avenge the death of her father at the hands of the Mush. So, thus we carried on. On a treacherous ocean, we huddled together in our small boat trying to cross it. I gripped Paola's hand tightly as the waves got higher and higher. Our shipped rocked wildly and my hand slipped... When I looked back, Paola had fallen overboard. We tried searching for her.... oh how we tried. But we found her dead.</p><p>I was despondent. Was it time to go back to SOL? It seemed so, three of our finest had died on MIA zones. It seems we were cursed.</p>

                <p><strong>Act 3: The Glimmers of Hope (D11~16)</strong><br>On the very same expedition that Paola had died, we finally found our first Starmap. It looked beautiful, a crystaline artifact glowing with lines. But all I could see was the blood of my fellow comrades, Jin Su, Hua and Paola that had paid in blood for that artifact. At times, I wanted to dash the Starmap to pieces, for I could barely restrain myself in sadness. Yet, the crew urged me to carry on, so I did. Only out of a sense of duty and responsibility.</p><p>During this period, Frieda somehow died. I was too numb to react, merely nodded and carried on. Kuan had died earlier due to his injuries, so did Roland, which was brain dead. How many people were active now? Too few to count. Ian, Andie, Chun, Janice and Terrence were the core crew and I could somewhat depend on.</p><p>And so the expeditions carried on and we when we were almost ready to go back to SOL, we found another Starmap piece. Spirits were lifted out and we decided to carry on. However, D15 on, fires were flaring up almost every cycle. Equipment started breaking apart. Hunter waves came in larger numbers. Our shields were almost depleted.</p><p>I fell into a deep slumber at end of D16. I never expected the shocking events of D17 that was to come. It would <strong><em>CHANGE MY LIFE FOREVER!</em></strong></p><br><p><strong>Act 4: Chaos Supreme (D17C1)</strong><br>I trash around reliving the nightmares of seeing three of our finest crew members dying whilst being lost on expeditions. Jin Su’s death left me shouldering the burden of Command. Then Hua’s death took out the life from the crew as all of them turned gloomy and serious. The worst was Paola’s death. I had the premonition was holding onto her so tightly. Oh ~ how I wished I was the one that drowned instead… As I trashed wildly, I suddenly awoke drenched in sweat in the medlab bed. And what I awoke to was a nightmare!</p><p><strong>A HUGE FLEET OF 37 HUNTERS</strong> had descended upon us. The alarms were ringing wildly but it seemed as the entire crew was dead. I tried waking them up. Calling them on the Communications Channel but they were silent as death. Was I all that was left of the crew? Was I still asleep and dreaming? I stumbled in blind panic as death beckoned.</p><p>Pure madness and rage descended upon me. Fueled by the crop of jumpkins left at the garden and adrenaline, I loaded in shot after shot at the Aracks via the turrets. Most of them missed, but I eliminated two Aracks with a third still out there. I slumped onto the turret seat drained awaiting death.</p><p>It was only then I heard the sweet voice of Chun…. Oh, I wasn’t all alone after all. She mumbled something about pilot and then it hit my head that I should have taken out a patrol ship to eliminate the Aracks. I ate the remaining jumpkins on the dorms and did just that before landing. I put in 2 fuel into combustion engine to the planet Janice had found earlier, East 2 Fuel! It had 3 Intelligent Life zones, where we hoped to find the last Starmap Fragment.</p><p>I then rushed to the Bridge to move us. But something stopped me…. I had the urge to scan a planet on the terminal. And I did, but failed at 80%, wasting 3AP. I stared at the screen, waste another 3AP on a blind planet scan at 99%? <strong>WAS I MAD, CRAZY AND INSANE?</strong> Yes, maybe I was. But I did it anyway. It said, West 4 Fuel, 17 zones with 2 zones uncovered by the Magellan Liquid Map artifact. Crystalite and Desert. I couldn't analyze the other zones as I was dirty and didn't have enough AP anyways.</p><p>Without any consultation with the rest of the crew, I went to load in another 2 fuel into the engine and rushed back to the Bridge to move us to the new planet. Was it madness? We would find out soon enough.</p>

                <p><strong>Act 5: A New Hope on Predator Mountain Nation (aka ‘Tumbledryer’ Planet) D17C2</strong><br>On cycle change, surprise surprise… We had 5 fires breaking out including at the Lab and the Bridge. The lab was broken as was the gravity simulator. Undaunted, I, Andie and Janice went down on the Icarus to the Predator Nation. 15 unknown zones and 1 desert and 1 crystalite. It was madness, but what choice did we have? I couldn’t scan, being dirty and the rest of the crew could hardly expend precious MP to move to the Bridge and back to Icarus Bay. So, down we went.</p><p>Upon reaching the luscious O2 filled planets, it was a mountainous place filled with vicious predators. After Janice fell down a mountain once, we carried on. Soon, we were being shadowed by dark, panther-like predators. They followed our every move and kept an especially keen eye on our only female, Janice. Something about her scent or hair-do, triggered them off. Both Andie and I meditated and focused on our peaceful auras to try and subdue these predators deadly and aggressive tendencies.</p><p>Alas! One of the Predators attacked and hurt Janice badly before backing off. Seeing red in turn, Janice viciously lashed out and killed one of the Predators yielding us three stakes. Janice gave as good as she got! Unfortunately, this provoked the other Predators to attack. Another two descended on Janice and ripped her to shreds.</p><p><strong><em>RIP, Janice! You were the pluckiest, most beautiful therapist we could ask for. I salute you for your bravery and courage.</em></strong></p><p>Both Andie and I were horrified but there was little we could do. We had to go back to Icarus and return with her body. We needed to re-group and re-supply on the Daedalus.</p><p>In the meantime, Derek our intrepid firefighter had died in an apparent suicide after losing his will to live. He had, of all things, two panic attacks! I don’t know whether to cry or to laugh…</p><br><p><strong>Act 6: The ‘TumbleDryer’ Strikes Back (D17C2 midway)</strong><br>When we returned, it appeared that Terrence and Chun finally awoke. My faith in the team was restored as they were dauntless and insisted on going for the expedition to find the last Crysalite. After healing up and saying our prayers, we were ready to head back to the Predator Mountain Nation.</p><p>In the meantime, poor Ian was stuck with two brain-dead ladies, Raluca and Eleesha. Our hippie Gardener managed to walk on fire whilst carrying the drone back from the Dorms to the Lab, and had time to relay on the Super Calculator all without getting dirty. Amazing! Until today, I don’t know how you did it!</p><p>Upon return to Predator Mountain Nation, it finally dawned on me that there was about <strong><em>SIX MOUNTAINOUS ZONES </em></strong>and <strong><em> 5 PREDATOR ZONES</em></strong>. Predators again dogged our every turn targeting again the only female member in our group, Chun. Thankfully, we manage to ward most of them off, with Chun suffering some minor injuries. Still, we trudged again against all odds and reached the crystallite zones. And Andie found the final STARMAP! Hallelujah! Yet, we had another 5 zones to go before we could reach back to the Icarus. Why couldn’t we go back straight away? So, we trudged on until we had two zones to go, before reaching the Icarus. In the meantime, it was now D17C3.</p><p>The fires had spread again, now there were<em> 9 fires</em>. The drone at the Lab fixed the Lab and Gravity Simulator. Thanks, Terrence for feeding crack to the drones! Your expertise came in useful. Still, could we even make to Eden if we survived the expo?</p><p>LAST TWO ZONES…. The last one was O2, cos’ Terrence forgot to bring his spacesuit but could still follow us. So what was the PENULTIMATE ZONE? An imposing sight… Ye GODS! A damn<strong><em> VOLCANO!</em></strong> We were quavering in our spacesuits sans Terrence. My knees felt weak and I almost fainted. The other team members were also at the end of their limits. Would this be the end of us?</p><br><p><strong>Act 7: Return of the Jed(en)i (D17C3)</strong><br>NO! We the Jed(en)i Knights (oops…) would not give up. We will carry on. Anyway, luckily for us the volcano was dormant. We traversed the area quickly, got 24 O2 and left the planet. Unfortunately, we still had the flaming wreck that was the Daedalus to take care of.</p><p>With the most excellent teamwork between Ian, Andie, Terrence and myself ~ we managed to complete the Supercalculator, finish triangulation of the Starmap pieces and I moved us to Eden. It was difficult but we managed with proper co-ordination and excellent timing.</p><br><p><strong>Postscript</strong><br>Many centuries after the founding of the Eden Empire, the tallest statues in the whole Capital were of those of the proud crew of the Daedalus. Their adventures are forever written in the annals of History and will be remembered for all times.</p><p>As our entire warship fleet assembles, all of the Mush serum are in readiness. Our strategies and tactics all mapped out carefully in accordance with Commander Jin Su’s ‘ART OF WAR!’ <strong>Onwards to victory, onwards to freeing SOL from the clutches of the Mush Collective! The Jed(en)i Order will prevail!</strong></p>

I ate like 9 jumpkins in that cycle alone and the crazyness of going to that last planet really took the cake.

                <p>Hey crew!</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Raluca Here!</strong> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico"> (The Ral Icon eludes me at the moment.)</p><p>WOW..... Just WOW..... Never thought we would make it.</p><p>Started out with that ship 1 hour and 15 mins late to the MMM (First one ive tried do get on) Due to a <strong><em>VERY</em></strong> intense DotA 2 match. First person that I met was Janice, who gave me some hugs to buffer my morale, as it was looking pretty good of a ship and I didn't want to waste a skill slot for Detatched crewmember. So I made my rounds as the resident Tech/Physicist/Genius/Designer and the first thing I noticed was <strong>PLASMA SHIELDS</strong> In the <em>FIRST</em> group of Neron Projects! I talked to Janice about it, and we decided that it wouldn't be against the rules to go ahead and get it D1C1. So I finished up with genius and my day as Ral and went to the back of the ship so that I could get some sleep in real life.</p><p>The next morning I wake up to see a Twinoid PM from my friend from the <strong><em>previous ship</em></strong> <span class="tid_user tid_user_8131233 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8131233">SaltyStan</span> saying that he missed the MMM too, but his ship looks really good with a plasma shield D1C1 and was wishing me luck! I laughed at him and told him your welcome because I am Ral and gave that to him. He told me was Ian there. I was extremely happy he got on with me again! <br><span class="tid_wspoil">I told him to cut off contact with me outside of game, as it was against the rules. So don't worry! The last message sent was agreeing not to use PMs or abuse the system to check each other. <em>Our anonymity was preserved</em>. </span></p><p>Ill continue in a bit. I gotta go take a walk before I run outa time! Be right back!</p>

                <p>Well I suppose the next thing that happened was Janice having a Panic attack because Derek left the Dorm 15mins before day change. (Mental image of Janice huddled in the corner, crying, trying to hold all of the blasters.) I felt like the voice of reason trying to calm the group down, and telling them to prepare, but not go at him guns blazing. He ended up coming back and it settled down pretty quickly as he had a Psych illness from killing Gioele earlier (I missed the whole thing, I just woke up and he was dead). Then Jin Su made himself a HUGE target, by going back getting dirty loading fuel for an expo and then making 50 post its BEFORE chatting with Andie. I was almost ready to kill him myself, but he was doing well for the crew and being helpful and friendly (Except for when he threatened my cat, where I responed with a long written essay on how I was going to kill him and make him suffer which seemed to shut him and everyone else up). So anyways we went on and on and narrowed the list down till we had found Frieda simply by timing. I said we should rush the serum so we did, and then they also rushed the natamy, even though I didn't think it was necessary. Shot up KT and Eleesha, and then sprayed Frieda and we were mush free.</p><p>Well sorry if this isnt fancy or seems rushed. I'm on a schedule here. I'll Stop in again and continue on, I have a lot more to say and I'd be happy to explain about later in the ship.</p>

                <p>Well we start up on the expos and nothing after nothing after nothing shows up. Literally every single trip we went on after the O2 one had Seismic Activity, because that was the <span class="tid_strike">easiest</span> <span class="tid_strike">safest</span> <span class="tid_strike">most desirable</span> only way we could find starmap pieces. We ended up finishing all Neron Projects around D8 and the research soon after. Our numbers then began to dwindle, after Jin Su died, and others followed suit.</p><p>This is where things get a bit problematic for me, as I said, because of my health. It's nothing life threatening but I was missing a lot of school for it and it is just unpleasant. I took a trip up to Rochester Minnesota to Mayo clinic, and my time online was cut a lot due to travel time, appointments, and spotty Wi-Fi. I managed to get on just enough to stay alive. <em>I'm willing to tell you what all was diagnosed and whatnot, but I don't wanna steal the thunder of the thread so it'll be in the spoiler at the end of the post.</em></p><p>To be honest, I didn't even realize Jin Su was dead until I saw people calling Stephen (Previously really quiet and seemingly half-ass-activity) commander, and him filling the part just as Jin had. Suddenly Stephen is the big dog here and we are flying under his orders, same as before but I missed Jin...... Even if he threatened my cat..... (Stephen still did a great job stepping up and filling the role. Not tryna downsize ya bud.)</p><p>I keep up my half-ass-activity of scanning planets and eating the rotten meat that Stephen seemed to have hid around the ship, but to no avail. I found Crystalline <strong>ONCE</strong> and a scan after that I found a <strong><em>Volcano</em></strong>. So I gave up and went roaming the back section of the ship to try and keep the Hull at 100 and fixing doors, oxy tanks, etc. when I could.</p><p>The only other exciting thing that happened to me was that once Stephen said we go back D16C1, but before Janice found our "Last ditch effort" Expedition, I had a full AP bar and took a Patrol ship out to shoot down 3 Hunters and a Trax (No sniper helmet or lenses) . I gotta say for an Astro, I'm a crack shot.</p><p>When I got on the next day, we suddenly had talk of a starmap piece, I personally thought, "Meh there is one. Not like we are gonna get the other. Someone should go back before we start losing more people." And well, that was yesterday, and here I am. <br><strong><em></em></strong><em><strong><br>And thus, Raluca the recluse, arrives at Eden, in the burning pits of <span class="tid_strike">hell</span> Rear Corridor.<br></strong></em><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">Now for me personally, I still have more tests that haven't come in. (Biopsies and whatnot) But at Mayo Clinic (Famous really big doctor's clinic at Rochester MN) they found that I had Narcolepsy, 2 Stomach ulcers, Depression, and my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.healthline.com/health/autonomic-dysfunction#Conditions4">Autonomic Dysfunction</a> (I had been diagnosed a year before. Also only skimmed through that link there, cuz even I don't wanna read all of that) Had progressed into "POTS" (more or less the same thing but different name and worse.) POTS and AD can both cause, and/or be worsened by the previous conditions, due to the fact that to treat it you need to eat Healthy and Drink a lot, (stomach ulcers really take away appetite) Sleep well (narcolepsy) Exercise, (hard to do when you feel like crap) and eat salt (cause stomach ulcers? I dunno bout that but I just don't like salt.) Now the next step is to go to some sorta Chronic Pain Rehab Center, which is like a 3 week day camp, so that I can function on days where I don't feel well. Gonna treat the other stuff and change up my routine before I go there though. (3Hr schooldays rather than 1day and then crash for the next 4 and work my way up to 4-5 etc. until im back full days.)<br> So that's kinda where I am at now. Like I said, nothing to sweat about. Just unpleasant. </span></p><p>By the way, I have off-and-on been playing this game since it was in Beta around the time when just about everyone had the beta key, and this is my first ship to make Eden!</p>

                <p>Paola here. I'm so glad to hear you made it to FREAKIN EDEN in the nick of time!</p><p>After I died, I told a friend about it and mentioned that this was my first complete Gold playthrough and it was the best 10 EUR I ever spent. I stand by what I said, now more than ever. I was already satisfied thinking we would go back to Sol after our fifteen-day space picnic, with a single starmap piece as a souvenir. Actually reaching Eden, though? Wow.</p><p>What can I say. Stephen's retelling of our adventure was EPIC. Jin's spreadsheet was a priceless resource, even though I was often too lazy to update it. Ian, I'm sorry about the jumpkins. Hua, you were the most trustworthy human ever. Raluca, I'm sorry about your health issues, but I assure you they didn't keep you from being productive and cool. The rest of you, you fulfilled your duties brilliantly.</p><p>P.S.: My last words ingame were #cantstopthesignal! How cool is that!</p>

                <p>Hi Joey/Paola!</p><p>Glad to see you read the AP. It was one hell of a roller coaster ride wasn't it. I'm so sad we lost you on the expo. It was tragic, because after we lost you, we found the Starmap piece and I was thinking well, we should be able to save you. After all, we couldn't be so unlucky in getting 3 for 3 strikes out, right? Unfortunately.... <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":tid_cry:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It was an EPIC journey right till the very end. We could have easily gotten a squad wipe with that last VOLCANO zone... <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/eek.png" alt=":tid_eek:" class="tid_ico"> But we didn't and made it to Eden. I think it will be hard to top this journey. I'll probably take it easy on Mush from now on.</p>

Yeah the prayer gave reply and i am not a <span class="tid_wspoil">mush</span></p><p>So i started of an <strong>Anti mush channel</strong> having <strong>Chun, Andie</strong> as our initial confirmed. We chose andie as the ship completed gas, C-serum, Myco alarms on the first day.</p><p>The mush got no hopes for sure from those killing researches, neither they can do ramping due to the super activitiy of the crew. I was very happy being not a mush as i have to go on grief in such a ship.</p><p>Chun warned not to invite any more people in to this channel as they might be converted after we confirm and the channel was going for 2 days. Chun found out luckily the already dirty <strong>Gioele</strong> was really a mush by her premonition. Then <strong>Derek</strong> killed him with Chun guidance. Yeah derek got a phsyco disease and we confirmed another human. So did we confirmed Raluca, Jinsu.</p><p>But there was nother <em>Antimush hunting channel</em> running on with <strong>Janice,Hua,Raluca.</strong></p><p>When we completed phermoderm and natomy rifile. We are all merged into one and we found parnoid messages running in the second antimush hunting channel. They suspected every active people without calculation of AP. But it was fun. Then as stephen described there was natomy rifile testing going on with our left out suspect of <em>Eleesha,Kuan,Frieda</em></p><p>So the final mush was converted, the first expo itself brought surprise with <em>Andie</em> lost. But she was lucky to be found alive in second round. From that onwards compass was owned by <em>Andie</em></p><p>From the second expo i joined and was seriously hit by the RNG gods. Lost more HP. I decided not to participate.</p><p>But excitement never go, i joined the third expo where again i got hit more, and to the bad luck we lost Jinsu. But he infact told in the <em>Chat, good luck crew if i found dead</em> It happened so that he was found dead <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":tid_nooo:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":tid_nooo:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>On fourth expo i was lost and thought this was the end for me. Damn i am going to miss the ship. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":tid_razz:" class="tid_ico"> But the luck was with me, i was found alive by <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/jiang_hua.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JH:" class="tid_ico"> Hua.</p><p>The fifth expo also got zones to be get lost. So i stopeed going to that. But the crew survived some damages and they returned.</p><p>The sixth expo i joined again cheering myself, no gain without a lose. But <em>Hua</em> faced his fate in this expo.</p><p>Then we lost Paola, Janice.</p><p>Overall the <em>Planet scanned and expo carried out are totally weird as there was minimum 2 people to get lost or siesmic activity</em></p><p>But when we found the last <em>Starmap</em> It finally gives reply all those sacrifice for the <strong>!EDEN!</strong></p><p>Still it was very sad to lose important active people like <em>Jin,Paola,Janice,Hua</em><br>This ship survived only by activity as there was not even any <strong>Gold project sponsor or Klix spent</strong></p><p>Wish to meet you all crew in my future game too.
