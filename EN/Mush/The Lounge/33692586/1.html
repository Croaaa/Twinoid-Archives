                <p>So this ship had it rough. If we had any very experienced players, they hid it well. Only 9 of us ever communicated - and both of our Mush were among them. I was possibly one of the more experienced players, and this was just my second game. I was Finola, and I activated gold when this ship started. I was the first aboard it.</p><p>Chao, a first time player, and Terrence, who was possibly our most experienced player, and myself sort of became a team. We three were the most active players who communicated, and an emergency occurred Day 1, with our Jin Su, who had never spoken but who had selected Cold blooded as his only skill (+3 AP with each player death), decided to attack Hua who was asleep in a dorm bed, first with kick off, then with three blaster shots. Hua survived, Hua was offline at the time, but Chao was not. I coordinated a private chat with every player who had ever spoken, we passed sentence on Jin Su and Chao and I attempted to kill him with the knife. We failed to finish him, then Terrence rose from his bunk to strike our insane commander down, who was reported for his play. Chao's tongue became torn during the fight, preventing him from speaking further for some time. Terrence and I both became ill from witnessing the death - with gastroenteritis. We trusted each other from that point, and we accepted Chao as probably human as well.</p><p>I'd initially made a common newbie mistakes thread, and included on it cooking all the food - had asked people to go slow on the food and to talk about it before cooking it. Our Stephen, a first time Stephen who said he was not brand new but still pretty new, commented in that thread to say he knew not to cook all the food. During D2, Stephen decided to cook 4 meals, eating one himself and leaving the other three to lie in the kitchen, then went to Bravo dorm and picked up, but never dropped the soap. He did drop a white flag - I had no idea what that meant at the time. But I did remind him to drop the soap, other people needed it too and not to walk out of the dorm with it. He answered hours later, completely oblivious to any harm caused, inviting people to enjoy the food left cooked in the refractory and saying that he couldn't drop the soap because he used it to make the white flag. And our ship still had at least two Mush aboard.</p><p>Court was adjourned, I at least was certain Stephen was Mush. He was slain, this time with me striking the last blow (poor Chao, unable to score the killing blow a second time in a row) but was proven human. Poor confused newbie Stephen - if he'd *asked* before doing what he did, he would have been told Don't! Not yet! His final words were «Either Finola and Chao were mushes and cunning ones, or they are simply fools.» - but as many players know, there is more risk than value in leaving cooked food lying in a camera-less room with mush aboard, and destroying the only bar of soap before the anti-mush soap can be made, leaving us to take 2 AP showers, and not even asking if this is a good idea or not first is not exactly a great idea.</p><p>What sort of newbie thinks that a white flag is more useful than the only bar of soap? One of our threads talked about how to use that soap to save AP when washing too.</p><p>Chao seemed especially shaken by this second human death. He suggested that we slow down and collect more evidence before we killed again.</p><p>Depression had already claimed Racula (who had logged out in the nexus, still looking at the terminal - others, including the assaultive Jin Su had crowded in there for several cycles - why, without a camera there? None of them ever answered. Janice died as well on D2, starving to death, still standing where she had first left the cryofreeze.</p><p>By this point we -still- had not completed any research or any projects. The mush sample had been hidden, I found it on D3 and started working hard on anti-mush research, hollering for relays which I got some help with, especially from Chao. I took to sleeping in the medibay, warning everyone to stay away, let me sleep in peace.</p><p>Late on D3, Frieda walked in on me, stayed for a minute, and walked out. I chewed her out for it, but by this point we were low oxygen, low hull, low morale.... Neither Terrence nor Chao were eager to kill her. I couldn't use the medibay any longer, too much risk, so I moved to the bridge to stand under the camera at least.</p><p>Later I had to sleep and was gone for about two and a half cycles.</p>

                <p>When I woke up, all was in chaos. For one, I was now a Mush. For two, Paola was dead - she had removed the camera to spike me the third time, claiming she believed a Mush had sabotaged it and it was causing our connection with sol to be disrupted. Frieda was indeed the other Mush, and she had spiked me in Medibay. The first spore I'd gotten from a trapped shelf at some point earlier.</p><p>Chau and Terrence were sure that Paola had converted someone in the bridge when she removed the camera. The three possible candidates were myself, Frieda, and the utterly idle Kuan-ti. Terrence openly speculated that it was possible that Frieda was already Mush (I'd made that accusation as well, before I'd been converted, I was MAD that she had walked in on me, and thought being Mush was the only reason why to) and that I was the likely convert. Oxygen was down to less than a day's worth, hull was around 30, we had hunters on us, Chun, who had never spoken at all that game, was attacking Chao on sight with her fists, not even picking up the knife when she was in the same room with it (probably thought Chun was mush, but was included in all private conversations we had and never spoke- I reported her for being unable to read English).</p><p>In all this chaos, I decided that humans couldn't possibly win, but I was low ap, low moves, why not be human for now? There was an oxygen planet found, 3 away - I told them to kill me if they thought I had to be mush, but first let me load that fuel. I loaded it honestly, then waited in a bed, talking openly and as helpfully as I could with Chao (I had to drop my communicator to load the fuel, lost the conversation with Terrence, and he had 3 conversations open, couldn't invite him back. But I could talk to Chao, who I knew was a first time player. He was sure I was Mush, but not quite sure enough - he felt the same way about Frieda. I told him I couldn't think of any way to prove I was human, so I'd just do what needed to be done and wait for him to decide. If he had to kill me I understood, and I wouldn't fight back if he did - I was -certain- he and Terrence were human after how they killed the Mush Paola. I was human I said, but couldn't prove it - if they had to kill me, at least I'd done all I could to help the ship first (if they had attacked me, I very much would have done something about it to fight back - there'd been 3 spores left on C8, so I spored and ate all three. I had far more AP and moves than I admitted I did).</p><p>Kuan Ti, Gioele, Ian, and Eleesha all suicided about that time, none of them having ever spoken to us.</p><p>My partner wanted to kill everyone, I wanted to convert... I felt there was all the time in the world, no way could humans win even if we sat down and tried to help them do so. My partner slew Terrence (who had attacked her, but failed to kill her) then fled. I felt so, so very sorry for Chao, so incredibly alone on the ship. A first time newbie, so trapped. Oh how I wanted to convert him to the winning side.</p><p>I offered Chao the deal I explained here, not intending to break any rules, but later worrying that I had: <a href="/tid/forum#!view/104909|thread/33654933" target="_self">Is this within the rules?</a></p><p>I then slew Chun, rested for more AP, wondering what exactly to do next, especially because I'd broken my tongue in that fight, and now couldn't speak -or- hear (I guess tongues hurt enough to make you deaf). Chao, Hua, Frieda, they were all offline or pretending to be. There was some 5th idle player alive, but he suicided the cycle after Chun died, leaving just us 4.</p><p>The next cycle I went to slay Hua, but could not finish the kill. I rested, then realized demoralize was probably the more effective and certain method, so used it. The next cycle a falling ceiling killed Hua before I could learn if my demoralize was enough. I inherited Comm officer - and with it I could make announcements, even without my tongue!</p><p>So I explained my tongue's injury and wished the final human, Chao, well - confirming at last for him that the other Mush was indeed Frieda (only us 3 left, 2 clearly Mush). And kept watch, intending at the very end of the cycle to demoralize him - I had just enough AP and moves to get to him and do that - but none to escape and I knew he had his three free blaster shots still from the new day (I'd used all 4 spores killing Chun and trying to kill Hua). We were also down to 1 oxygen at that point.</p><p>I was watching the game every few minutes, just in case I could catch him start to move before he reached me and tried to shoot me - and I saw him start to move. I announced 'Good morning, Dave' (2001: A Space Odyssey Hal 9000 AI-that-goes-crazy reference) and watched - yep, he was coming for me, not the other Mush. So I dodged around, evading him, using up the AP that I'd intended to use to demoralize him, but preventing him from getting a shot off at me.</p><p>What I didn't know was that though Mush don't need to eat, don't need morale, water hurts them - but they still do need to breathe. Chao had gotten into a space suit (I knew this from room log); that was fine, demoralize works through a space suit - but that next turn I was the one that suffocated, leaving an offline Frieda and an online Chao two rooms from her, still with his free blaster shots, to decide how that game was going to end. It's over now.</p><p>I'd picked the [AP] name 'learning hurts' while still humans. A ship full of inactives and partial and complete newbies - what a way to learn. And after I picked that name, wow, how fitting a name it remained. I was surprised to get the golden supernova, and surprised at how very much the two Mush wanted me turned as the 'leadership' of the humans - I'd told everyone it was just my second game, and ha, leadership? We died D5, no research completed, no projects completed. We -reached- a planet, but no expo was possible at that point...<br><br>Still, we did learn. It's just that learning hurts when it's like that.<br><br>Any of you guys I shipped with reading this? What can you add to the story? Stephen, I'm especially sorry about your death - if you had talked FIRST, then acted, you would not have died. What you did was a decent set of actions for a Mush or a griefer to do - you were not reported though (at least not by me) as I believe you acted as you thought best. Learning hurts, yeah.</p>

                <p>Hi, I'm (was) Paola and I'm (was) a Mush.<br><em>Hi Paola!</em>...</p><p>A little story why Frieda and I choose you, Finola, to infect. I was already trapping shelfs and I believe Ian got a spore. But then Frieda told me she infected you in the Medibay, and since you were one of the most actives we came to the conclusion to make you a Mush. You already had one from a shelf and Frieda infected you the second spore. After that you became aware and fled to the bridge, so there was no way we could spike you a third time.</p><p>The ship was falling, hull was almost zero, oxygen was almost zero, hunters attacking us, but I wanted to make that last spore count. So I tried to lure you to use the shelf at the turret. Too bad you didn't had any MP left so that plan didn't work.</p><p>As a last resort I decided to remove the camera, convert you to Mush and say that I believed the camera interrupted the connection with Sol (because of all the newbie action's that took place at this ship, I thought you people would believe me <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":tid_smile:" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>Obviously Chao didn't believed me and killed me. But my goal was achieved, I made the 'Leader' Finola one of us! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I was really excited for this tread because I wanted to know how our story ended. What your thoughts were when you came online as an agent of Mush. What people where saying in the discussion tab. Wat Frieda did when I was dead. Who won?! All those questions are finally answered and with that I would like to say:</p><p>Thank you crewmembers of the ship 'Learning Hurts', thank you for this great game where I had fun playing as a Mush!<br>And especially thanks to Impet, for your story. It was really amazing to read it and you're a great story teller! <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":tid_happy:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>And thank you, dearest Paola. You gave your life to get me - which was really unnecessary! I had 2 spores! Did you know that 2 spores grow a third? If you'd waited a day or two, I would have become one of you without any further action. And there was no rush - the ship was falling apart, dying, we couldn't hold it together. We were so demoralized from Jin Su and Stephen both being human, and how few actives we had, how little communication except for the Terrence-Chao-Finola triad... that we weren't even killing probable mush - like Frieda - I was sure she was Mush! - anymore. And I didn't suspect Paola at all... at least not more than I suspected anyone else.</p><p>However, that was my first experience as being a Mush. Thanks to your sacrifice, I had a very different story to tell! Instead of relaying the fight to save the ship against impossible odds, I get to be 'the human so important to convert that a mush chose to die to convert me', which is one <em>heck</em> of an impressive honor. And then I got to play through the end of the game - and got to have the top glory, which I assure you - I would not have had if I had remained human <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/bg.gif" alt=":cool:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So I'm like a really blessed newbie - Game 1 I got to win as with the team as a human, game 2 I got to lead the glory with a sort of win as converted Mush, and wow, the story of my conversion - a story you gave me. Thank you! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"> and all because of you!</p>

Something I did like to see, too bad it cost me my live and I couldn't see the consequences.

                <p>Hi Frieda! I knew I'd been spored three times, I could see far enough back in the mush chat to see my first sporing from the shelf. I was wrong (but didn't know at the time) and believed that you guys could have just waited to turn me into a Mush through time once I'd been spored 2x. I've since asked around and found out that's not true! I'm so very glad to know it's not.</p>
