                <p>"To those brave souls that undertook this journey, I salute you. You risked all for your brothers and sisters stepping out onto this dangerous journey that would inevitably lead to our deaths. You knew the dangers and you stepped up to the challenge fully knowing the risks involved. <br>Your story ends here with you. No records of your deeds will ever return to Sol outlaying your bravery, courage, and sacrifice. You will miss out on any praise for your glorious achievements. But this adventure was more than. Those brave souls such as yourself did not come here seeking praise, rewards, riches or celebrity status... you did this because it was needed for our species to survive. It is regretful that what you have accomplished will die here with this ship. For your dead could have filled history books. It is with my last breath that I thank my fellow agents of mush. It was a great journey and you have made your Captain proud. May mush prevail! Captain Jin Su out."<br>~ Jin Su <br>Day 5, Cycle 6</p><p>Hello everyone that took part on voyage ####. This is Jin Su (Alpha Mush) reporting in <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>I was really excited at the potential of this ship till I found out I was mush... I quickly realized that my days would be numbered quickly if I made any rash or risky moves. So in order to survive, this would have to be a long play game. <br>My first opportunity to strike came at the expense of Frieda who was being rather bossy on the main channel and not being very cooperative. When she stated she wouldn't do her job till the mush were killed, I knew she was my largest threat and had to be killed quickly. Chao was already suspicious and right fully so. I would have been too. I gave him a few words of encouragement and sent him after her. With his actions, there was one less mush hunter on the ship and it was human on human violence at that.<br>Racula stirred up the pot quite a bit drawing in a lot of attention on this. It really did force me to lay low for about a good 24-36 hours. I managed to trap a few shelves in the back of the ship and await my traps to go off before figuring out how to convert. It wasn't more than an hour later, Racula sprung a trap. Both Finola (Other Alpha) determined in 24 hours we would both strike out at Racula and convert her. It was extremely risky to do since I knew Eleesha covered all the room logs with a fine comb looking for trouble. I then took Anonymush so not to alert the crew. This must have been about Day 3.<br>You guys were extremely lucky on your first expo. I was trying to stall you guys from launching till I could be online so I could ditch six of you on the planet. Lucky for you guys, you managed to pull it when I was sleeping. My hat goes off to the human crew for pulling off the expo too, from out of orbit to boots on the ground looked to be about an hour. That is really really good. I've see my fair share of crews take 24 hours to get an expo going.<br>I pushed hard for NCC lenses because I infected the cat. I think only Paola was infected by that flea bag... it seems Chun saved the entire crew by working the project mostly by herself. Plan failed for the mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br>Well at this point, our ability to convert was nearly impossible with the research completed. People were dying off from starvation and the amount of Mush suspects became smaller and smaller. I knew Finola was about to be killed off by the mush hunters and I didn't want to see her die.<br>On D5 C4-5, Racula and myself launched our attack into Alpha Dorm. Grenades, Blasters, and knives were used to paint the walls red from the human race. We managed to kill off Chun, Gioele, and Chao. Racula then transferred into Eleesha and I killed the vessel that was Racula. During the stab fest, Paola made had me rolling on the ground when she stepped into the room. Hung out for a minute then walked out as if nothing had happened. Mean while a stream of names are flashing down the main channel of people dying left and right at our hands. Roland logs in and I blame a body transfer with Paola who appears to have gone off line. He spends what I assume most his AP/MP trying to figure out what happens. The ruse only lasts till cycle change when Paola dies of moral.<br>Now in Bravo dorm resides Finola (Mutated), Jin Su (Mush), and Eleesha (Old Racula/Mush) facing off against Roland, Hua, and Ian. Hua logs in, looks around, and splits without saying a word. He takes off in one of the fighters. I make my move to spare him a quick death by running to the Bridge to pilot the ship... only to be thwarted by an Arack.<br>Things slowed down a lot at this point as everyone was out of AP and were all sitting around waiting for three hours to pass so we could exchange a few punches only to wait for the next cycle. I think everyone was kinda hoping to be the next person to die. <br>Well it is now Day 6, Cycle 3. Half the ship is on fire, half a dozen hunters are attacking us, and two asteroid about to impact us now. The ship is at 5 hull and will be destroyed next cycle. We tried to make an effort to repair Pilgred, but our RL schedules wasn't going to let that happen. So I leave you with this AP as we sit here on our final hour waiting for the hunters and fire to finish us off.</p>
