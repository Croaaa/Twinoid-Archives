                <p><em><strong>Note: If you were on this ship and haven't clicked "Confirm End Screen" Please report Chun.<br>That was very selfish and unfair to all of you awesome players.</strong></em></p><p>How do you report a player for a forced Sol Return from the Ship End screen?</p><p>Here is the not so brief history, I was Terrence, one of the mush - Kuan Ti killed Janice, destroyed all fire extinguishers then transferred into my Terrence body, stole a bunch of items, [the usual, soap, apron scooter etc.] and tried to escape but failed because I didn't have much AP/MP. He "hid" his i'trackie in the same room he did the transfer [fail]. So we got rid of him pretty fast. The crippling blow was from destroying our Fire Extinguishers. We banded together, killed the 2nd mush which he exposed by leaving an open private channel with it on his walkie talkie which showed up immediately as i picked it up in my new body. 2n mush was Raluca, our Stephen did excellent job in saving his Apprentice skill to copy Raluca before killing her. We had fires spread in 5-6 rooms, all around us Moved half of the food supply to Engine room to finish PILGRED Reactor. Paola worked feverishly to contact KALADAAN and keep our morale up. Jin Su was spreading motivation. Several people bought Coffee Thermoses for the work ahead. We had 2 new players do excellent job with our guidance, Ian taking care of our plants while in full crisis mode. Whole Alpha bay side engulfed in flames. New player Andie also excellent job, only a pilot but we took the time to teach him about the game, hope he had fun, flew out to kill hunters and gather precious scrap for the diminishing Hull from fire damage. Our Gold Hua tag teamed with Stephen eventually and PILGRED was finished. Frieda had found us a planet with O2 and Food. Fuel was loaded, Commander changed ship direction. *We [thanks to our generous Frieda] donated MT Passes for our personal crew Best last Hope* the excellent player who was mr. Derek Hogan. He leveled up to 3 and took *Firefighter*. He took out 3 fires, purchased vending machine food to take care of the other 3 fires in the next cycle. O2 tanks were blown in the fire, So we rushed those rooms first. I repaired the hull to 89 [we had 8 more spare metal Scrap] fixed the tanks deployed the drone in Engine room and went to rest. Then traders show up that gave us 8 O2 and 2 Fuel. All is nice and well. Gioele will wake up, take 4 cycles of coffee and rush Retro-Fungal Serum.... mission accomplished right...wrong... Chun takes hacker kit and hack-jumps to Sol.<br><br>This is Day 4 / Cycle 4, <br>End stats were 20 O2, 89 Hull [8 more Metal Scrap] Firefighter donated to crew member, several food items purchased from vending machine, O2/Food planet locked on Astronav and ship heading adjusted, ready to jump. 12 people active/alive and giving it our all, working together against all odds. <br>2 mush killed, 1 human killed by mush, 1 human starved [was inactive] <br>So I'm pissed, please tell me how to report this CHUN player.<br><br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4597" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4597</a><br><br><strong>Below, I attached a series of questions and answers from the Q&amp;A thread, in case some you visiting happen to read this and maybe one day are in the same situation.</strong><br><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8095259 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8095259">Kyubey</span></span><cite><br><strong>Answer about forced return</strong><br>While you are still on that screen - <a target="_blank" href="http://rghost.ru/56447271.view"></a><a href="http://rghost.ru/56447271.view" target="_blank">http://rghost.ru/56447271.view</a> you can select any post and press "report" as usual.

Once you've confirmed your last words, you have no further option to report someone from your ship. That doesn't rule out the possibility of someone else from your ship reporting an offending player, however. The fact is, we don't investigate unless a report is filed, and more to the point, it's because we <strong>can't</strong> investigate unless a report was filed by someone from that ship.</cite><br><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8276512 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8276512">SmirnoffPete</span></span><cite><br>But there was no way for me to be sure who to report, I may false report an innocent player unless I click on confirm then manually click each person details to see who was the hacker.

No apologies are needed, since others reading this may also benefit from the answers. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br><br>We generally can't sanction someone unless they were the direct subject of a report. So reporting yourself, and stating, "I don't know who did this, but..." isn't going to facilitate an investigation, for example. The judges can't do anything about such cases. (While the mods sometimes intervene with manual sanctions, we generally leave it up to the judges.) As Adoncia stated, you can view your ship's End screen before you actually confirm your last words. This is most helpful in case of a potential Harmful Return.</cite></p>

Derek took down 2 fires and bought a Rice treat for the remaining 2. I fixed the hull back to 89 points, we had 8 more spare Metal parts. Fixed the O2 tanks. Paola did a Alien Trade for 8 O2 / 2 Fuel. She was ready on the comms to rush KALADAAN for +6 morale. Frieda had a O2/Food planet ready to go. She was saving AP for pilot stuff, Hua was saving AP for pilot stuff and Andie was great too. Andie went and got us all that Scrap Metal. Jin Su aligned the ship in the Planet direction heading, gave out all the speeches he could, He patched himself up with pills, I had a banana saved up for emergency for someone in need. Plants were fine, thanks Ian. The Serum was as good as done, the situation was contained. And then , i come on to refresh for cycle change,,.. boom we're done game over. I was furious when I wrote that.</p>

                <p>Okay, she's been reported. Now, onto more specifics of the game!</p><p>So I started with the usual - Waking up from cryo, not taking any skills, not really saying anything until the mush are assigned. I woke up just in time before cycle change to snatch up Medlab bed, so yay! There were only a few hunters left so I decided to turret them off in the very likely chance that I would be human and went to bed to wait for mush assignment. I make a note about Terrence/Paola/Frieda/Hua/Kuan Ti, they seem to be skilled players and I'd need to watch out for them. Eventually, mush assignment occurs and I'm human as usual. I let everyone know that I'm Silver L6 and will pick up wherever we're weakest at in the game after we figure out which mage books we get. Things go pretty smoothly until I wake up to find a grenade in mine and Ian's faces in the Laboratory, courtesy of Terrence.</p><p>That damn cripple! I knew he was suspicious! I decide to make an executive decision and take Creative, oh god I love Creative when it comes to killing mush. I noticed he took the apron, too. Oh no, I know -exactly- where he's going, and who that blip in Alpha Bay is. I gotta hurry! Unfortunately for him, he left behind the Thermos of Coffee that I left for Gioele. I drank 2 coffees and saw Ian in the mushroom cloud looking just as shocked as I was. Ian fought back against the mush the best way any Ian could - through supporting me with a ration and a knife and confirming information for me. We traded heals to pick ourselves up from that grenade (Why did you throw a grenade in the Lab anyway with only me/Ian/inactive Roland in it while Bravo dorm had more people and not 3 AP cost..?) and met up in Central Corridor for the item exchange. Geared up, I swooped into Alpha Bay and caught Terrence preparing to take off. Real imaginative, wheels. This one's for Janice! *Stab*</p><p>So one mush is dead. Interestingly, it seems Kuan Ti dismantled a Fire Extinguisher here. "ORLY?" I thought to myself as I used this clue to deduce that Kuan Ti was the second mush. Clearly perfect evidence! I created a "Let's kill Kuan Ti!" thread and invited everyone on board except him and requested a kill on sight for him, that is until I moved a few inches to the right into Bravo Dorm where Kuan Ti was waiting next to a mountain of evidence proving his innocence. Of course, a would-be transfer victim set up to be killed by the rest of us..I learned not to fall for <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1587">that trick</a> a long time ago. It would seem that the original Kuan Ti was the mush, he began by killing Janice and spiking Terrence's body then transferring with him after dismantling our fire extinguishers. DIRTY! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/stinky.png" alt=":mush_stink:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So I called back the "Kill Kuan Ti request" and even invited Kuan Ti, former Terrence, into that thread himself to show just how much I knew for certain that he was confirmed human and a victim of transferring. Rather fortunate for us too because he turned out to be the driving force using lots of bolded letters to get everyone else to work together on Pilgred and the serum. Oh wait, I forgot about Raluca. Yes, Kuan Ti told me in private that he noticed Terrence had an empty private whisper open with Raluca. That -was- suspicious..but what if it was a trick? We kill our Pilgred support, turns out to be human...could have been bad. I'd have done something like that before rampaging, anyways. So we rested on it a bit until a fire kicked up in Central Corridor. Well crap, already? No fire extinguishers, Bronze L1 Derek, unimaginative Terrence may just get his easy mush victory after all. <strong>WRONG!</strong> It may have set a time limit on us, but like hell was I going to let a mushroom win -that- easily. You have to -earn- your victory when you're an <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> Agent of Galactic Supremacy <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">! We had the power to finish Pilgred and return home before we all burned to death and doggarnet, I was going to throw Raluca's body in the reactor to fix it if I had to. However, there was the slight problem that the other mush was still alive and could very well not be Raluca. I came close to suggesting the dreaded, probably even illegal <strong>blanket food test</strong>. I figured, if the mush want to use a dirty tactic in making it so we can't put out fires, why not let the humans use a dirty tactic in finding the second mush? I couldn't think on it anymore; I had to go to the Engine Room. Something was calling me.</p><p>When I arrived, I saw Raluca standing in a corner with her hands in her pockets. The room saw very little activity over the past day, she seemed to have gone into the Nexus and come back. I pointed my knife at her while making my way to the Pilgred reactor. <em>0%</em>. That did it, what has she been doing this whole time if she hasn't even started Pilgred!? In a fit of creative knifeplay, I gutted the mushroom while learning the secrets of being a Technician from her before throwing my knife down. Mush #2 dead. Good riddance, let's go home. If she won't fix it, -I- will. Unfortunately..I developed a fear of crowds for some reason. I guess I imagined a mob of people with exchanged Terrence/Kuan Ti faces with cat bodies? I don't know man. But it sucked.</p><p>Here's where Kuan Ti really started to shine, calling for Pilgred's repair and managing the crew as best as he could to get everyone efficiently where they needed to be so we could turn this rampage around and shove it in Terrence's face. Pilgred was easy enough to fix between me and Hua (Had Tech), although that was more thanks to Hua and the others resetting her because Jin Su and Chun idled in the Engine Room after I asked them -not to- due to my sudden fear of crowds. The problem was the cure...we had lots of hands in the Engine Room and no one in the lab trying to synthesize it. After we got Pilgred fixed, Kuan Ti worked with the others to get everyone pinging that cure. In fact, things were beginning to look like we wouldn't have to fly back so soon, since we had 3 very generous people on board willing to upgrade Derek to Gold Mode so he could learn Firefighter. SPECIAL thanks to Paola and Kuan Ti for making that offer and for Frieda for actually making the donation. This is probably the best part about this ship, Derek seems like he's been flying for a while so I'm very glad he got to get upgraded for all his ships going forward. Thank you so much for his sake, Frieda!</p><p>So Derek began to heroically throw his body on the fires, putting them out one by one. It looked like he was going to succeed, hunters were under control, Kuan Ti bought him a thermos of coffee and Derek bought himself some food from the vending machine. We were going to come out of this alive, make the cure, and reach Day 10! I went to bed for the night as it was 3:30 in the morning for me confident that Kuan Ti was rounding up the others to finish the cure. Then I woke up to this. I typed out my end game message thinking things got out of control and they did what's for the best, but something was bothering me. What if Raluca was a beta? I'd hate to leave smug words on the end screen for Terrence only to find out there was a master mush plot going in which Terrence and converted Raluca were meant to disguise someone to fly back to Sol with us. I'd have done it, anyway. So that's when I popped on here, almost embarrassed myself on the [AP] Damn you, Stephen! thread, and saw this.<br><br>And that's our ship! It may not seem very interesting to the outside eye but it's a good reminder to show what this community really does for each other. Sure, we often disagree, go on for pages about what's a bug and what's bad game design, suspect and kill each other while violating each other's bodies..but in the end, we're all in this galaxy together. For every griefer who wakes up and kills Janice or Chun, there is the Kuan Ti who brings a ship together. For every Jin Su who wakes up and demands that the crew follow his orders or die, there is the Frieda who donates her personal savings to the Derek who can single handedly save the crew. For every Chun who wakes up and curses everyone out and goes inactive, there is the newbie Ian who diligently tends to the crew's hope despite fires burning all around him while he begins his journey on this wonderful game. We may all be from different parts of the world, but when the going gets tough, we band together and show what teamwork in mush can really do.<br><br>So thanks guys, it was a short flight, but a damn good one. Been an honor flying with you! I realize how grumpy I might have sounded towards Terrence mush, but I'd still like to see him post in here his plans and ideas that may not have been able to come to pass as well as everyone else who was on board!</p>
