                <p>Hey Roland! Deceased Hua <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hua.png" alt=":mush_hua_50:" class="tid_ico"> here! Wow, it was a great ship.<br>To be honest, I woke up just terrified I'd be mush. First on the ship, just off a pretty good RP ship as Roland. And to be honest, when I was first playing, every Hua on like every ship was <strong>Mush</strong>, it was a trend. So I was terrified I'd be Mush - and happy when I wasn't. So, the mush-hunting began.<br>First target was Jin Su, I did not trust him. Of course Kuan Ti died of starvation early off so he wasn't a problem (he's usually a suspect of mine too). Actually, the ship was pretty calm: We had a good Frieda, but she was a bad-luck Frieda (new, not Mush it turned out, she was on the Xyloph list as confirmed). Went on an expo which was fun to RP as Hua. And then - things got interesting.<br>I got on one day and there was a dot in engine room with inactive Raluca. I had already had a communications channel open with Janice, so it was she and I together who went back and looked. I think myself, <strong>Janice</strong>, <strong>Paola</strong> and <strong>Jin Su</strong> were all through there rather fast. I placed a mycoalarm and stood with her for a bit, but we made the decision to off Terrence and wait for Raluca, since she was inactive and PILGRED was at 7%. Well, Terrence of course was mush. (Need I mention he was sitting in ER, dirty?)<br>So that's one mush down. The second one, I must say, was rather elusive. Our expo gave me rubella and at the same time poor Janice got a cold, both were healed by Finola and <strong>confirmed human</strong>! Yay! Soon after I went up to medlab to try out our new mycoscan that Finola built (we had an excellent Finola, by the way) and found out that Ian had double-ate - confirmed human. Didn't invite him, yet. Later, I saw that Stephen was vomiting all over the place, so he was confirmed. I finally started the mush-hunt channel. Chun was inactive, sadly, so she was not involved. Meanwhile, I was communicating close with Finola (you were great, BTW!) and she wanted to work on RFS, with me telling Janice her progress. Eventually, she finished it, and we decided she would drop it in AD and I would pick it up (later I think that was a mistake?)<br>But in the ordeal of bringing the RFS, Finola accidentally ate twice - a pill then a ration - <strong>confirming her human</strong>. She was invited to the channel. The next morning, Jin Su was vomiting - he had been our prime suspect, but he was confirmed human now too. Which only left Gioele, Chao and Roland, as the Xyloph list cleared Frieda as not being Alpha and she geniuinely seemed to freak out over her starting spore. (Somewhere in all that, Raluca starved - Janice thought she was mush but turns out, no).<br>Well, I laid out a plan and everyone agreed: We'd take out Gioele who was doing nothing, then if he wasn't the Mush take out Chao. Or something of that order. And only if it wasn't either of them (which I at least truly thought it would be), we'd RFS <strong>Roland</strong> so I wouldn't be alone in piloting.<br>Let me note here that I was the only tech. <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_eng.png" alt=":mush_pa_eng:" class="tid_ico"><br>Roland put together a grenade, landed it on me, transferred into Chao and finished me off. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> Well, now I'm gone. And though I hear Chao did pretty good in your old body Roland at taking out the hunters, it was sadly not enough. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br>It was a great ship and I miss it. Fun characters, good RP, first Italian Roland I've seen. It'll be great to see you all again!</p>

                <p>So, here goes my experience as mush on this ship. I chose Roland, because I like shooting stuff. Besides, I wanted to RP an italian hot stud, and I had a dictionary opened, which I used to replace certain phrases with bono bene italian signs!</p><p>Mush selection. I'm one of them! Phuf. First thing, contact my Terrence accomplice on private channel. Don't want no Pheromodem sneaky people reading our chats! Unfortunately, it was very sad - Terrence didn't speak a word to me.</p><p>I do a NERON relay, extract two spores, wash in BD, lie low. Crew finished ASG and CS in like...5 cycles? A mushs' dream <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I saw on the mush chat that Terrence infected Ian (hence, he had level 2 spores) and went to ER, dirty. I think he tried to infect Raluca, but hit her by mistake. His Ian infection was mostly useless, as Ian was hardly active. Of course, crew spots this immediatly. I try to tell Terrence in private chat that he is sabotaging himself and me, since he will give humans more antimush research. He doesn't reply.</p><p>I got shooter points, so I offer to kill him, to attempt to gain some credibility with the humans. The deed is done. Janice gets a sickness. One more confirmed human. But! One less tech!</p><p>I decide to take trapped and trap the RC, as all the other areas are protected by cameras. Janice eats one spore, but that's the extent of my actions, as crew finished mycoalarms. This will prove to be the last spore I extracted in this game.</p><p>From here, it's a really quiet game of pretend-to-be and dreadful panic building up. I see the research progress at a blistering pace: mycoscanner by like day 4, day 5 spore sucker, crew cleans itself of the spores (Janice and Ian mostly), so much for my trapper skill. I do one "easy" hunter run, and do a big hunter run, killing two trax and 4 hunters, hoping it would dissuade the crew from suspecting me in the first place, but rather somewhere down lower, as I need time. In other news, Raluca dies of starvation. Tech count: -2</p><p>Crew goes on expo. Commander is with them, HK secure - no luck to hijack daedalus.</p><p>I ding the next level as mush - TRANSFER available. I breathe out. At the very least, I've got an exit plan, if I'm not RFSed before.</p><p>A wave of like 17 hunters appears. I'm full AP, but this time I lie low. I see that crew finishes RFS, Natamy rifle - the lot. My options are thinning and I can only hope that the low tech count combined with the missing Plasma Shield will give a chance for the ship to blow up. A couple of cycles pass, crew deal with the hunters, but armor is now at a respectable 31.</p><p>Day 7. More people get confirmed as humans. Someone gets tortured, I assume to prove the humanity. Inside, I feel like my options a becoming very limited. It's hard to describe this feeling, of a lone mush. All I see is the growing list of research and the inevitable doom. Eleesha will sooner or later print the list, and then I'm ducked, I'm thinking. So, I muster my courage and decide to go on a spree.</p><p>My hope was to take out all the pilots and techs of the ship. Which would leave Daedaluus crew with the idea to do Pilgred by 1%. I assemble a grenade. Pick up a blaster that is left carelessly in BD. Boom, Jin Su and Hua take damage in BD. 3 blaster shots on Hua. Proceed to maul her with my fists. But armor is doing it's job! She's alive. I've got 3 AP I need for a transfer, so I head into the alpha dorm, transfer into full AP Chao. Go back to BD. Here a massive fail happens: I forget to select wrestler skill, so I do bring down the gold tech/pilot/super motivator Hua and pick up RFS that was...on her?? But ultimately fail to kill Jin Su. He must have been very low, but not dead. This mechanical mistake cost me a lot! One can see that this was my very first transfer, eh?</p><p>I try to play stupid a bit in chat, but the crew is smart, they figure out the transfer. Later I find that I could've done this much more smoothly, but honestly the panic was so high that I just wanted to do something, as I felt the doors closing in on me.</p><p>I hold the armor and Ian is in Dorm, so the crew needs to wait one cycle before they can kill me. I'm still hoping to kill Jin Su, so I see him get out of the dorm. I chase him down, but through lag/my inability to orient without a talkie, I miss him. Crew finish me off in a storage place. //The end. <br><br>I have to say in closing, that the human crew was very active and very determined. I was obviously not included in a "trusted" list, despite my best efforts to get into it. That's a plus. I wish we could've been on the same side, but alas, such is the fate of this mimic/somewhat succesful rampage mush.</p>

                <p>Hey people, I was <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/finola.png" alt=":mush_finola_50:" class="tid_ico"> on that ship. As a forenote, I saw this ship getting pretty far honestly, although I felt that projects were a fair bit behind and I was concerned by the lack of techs (primarily due to the deaths of Raluca and Terrence). But anyway, my story.</p><p>So I woke up as Finola, with just medic at the time as I am a silver player. I get tarted as soon as I wake up with organising items, trying to put them into the right place with my OCD. Afterwards, I think I just settled into a routine of research and asking whether to pick Diplomat or Biologist or Nurse. In the end, I decided to use up some MTPasses I had lying around as it seemed like a pretty solid ship.</p><p>I actually remember you guys accusing me of being mush since I didn't relay one of the key researches, but I was asleep during that time, I can't do both at the same time! XD. Research went really well, but I felt that Neron projects were fairly slow</p><p>From what I remember, I talked to Hua (or butterfly, or was that me?) with her callsign. The Terrence thing happened and went, and I soon realised that Hua was the only tech on board, making her quite the valuable asset being the only one to improve pilgred more than one percent.</p><p>Fast forward a bit and I saw that some people wanted to see the mush killed. At this point, I was not a confirmed human but I knew that Hua was. I decided to pledge my assistance to the whole mush hunt, and I can't remember if I or her suggested to complete RFS. Either way, I was relaying it, telling her that and telling me when Janice (a biologist/IT expert as well) had relayed it. Not done anything like that honestly XD.</p><p>It was at that point where I ate a couple of things, I think it was a pill and a fruit or something, to try and help me to finish off RFS before I went to sleep. I then realised that I accidentally confirmed myself human, and double eating is something I frown upon. Before that, I tell her that I'll drop her RFS so that it is in a confirmed human's hands. At this point I join the mush hunt channel.</p><p>I put forward my list of suspects, from top to bottom: Jin Su, Gioele, Roland, Raluca, Paola/Freida at the bottom. As you know, they started devising a plan on how to use the RFS, and also who to kill. People started to finish off Natamy Rifle, which then gave us the two major anti-mush tools: The cure, and the Rifle.</p><p>Fast forward a bit, Jin su becomes confirmed human which completely baffles me as he was my main suspect and I had a <em>whole</em> load of evidence stacked up against him, and then Roland rampages. He then kills Hua and transfers in to Chao. I then realise that our chances for a quick return hope were crippled, as we have no techs to complete pilgred. Hua, I'm so sorry you had to go like that. You were a great team member.</p><p>I then decide to propose a mad plan: We keep Chun (who is highly inactive) alive, and prepare to trade her. We keep visiting planets, do Neron projects etc. but we would look out for trading ships, which could give us pilgred for our Chun. With the Neron boos, Plasma shield would be a bit more doable, and perhaps by the time we got pilgred we'd be close to calculating coordinates to Eden. This is unusually optimistic of me, however after 10-11 months of playing and no Eded, not even once, I was desperate to exploit every chance we had to try and get there.</p><p>However, we met our demise as the hunters got the better of us and no scrap left to maintain the hull, let alone the techs to leave dedicated to do the job. However, it was a great journey for those who were active.</p><p>So, Thanks to:</p><p>Hua - being such a great buddy on that ship and being so active to keep the ship kicking<br>Eleesha - for compiling all of those logs, being a active mush hunter is a tough job!<br>Janice - for also being active<br>I can't think of anything else I can say, but to those who were alive and active (+ Hua!) you were all great!</p><p>Thanks!<br>Zazyman, Finola.</p>
