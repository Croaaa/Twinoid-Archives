                <p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1994" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1994</a></p><p>After 16 ships playing as human, I finally got a chance to be alpha mush! And as my favorite character: Eleesha! The ship in general was a good one to be mush in, there were way too many inactives and humans making way too many mistakes. But there were also some good players and I’m sorry for all the lying, cheating and manipulations I’ve done.</p><p>Anyway, here is my perspective of what happened on the ship:</p><p><strong>Day 2 </strong></p><p>I was one of the last ones to wake up from cryo on day 2 cycle 1 and soon after waking up I am welcomed to mush! First thing I do is to check who the other mush is… Stephen, oh great, someone that was already on the blacklist of the ship for cooking way too many rations on cycle 8. I tried to talk with him on the mush channel and got no answer for almost a day so I started with my own plan. I removed two spores, showered and started thinking about who to try to convert first. My first pick was Jin Su since I noticed he was a gold player with 4 skills and seemed a good target. As soon as I got a chance to spike him, I did and then laid back for several cycles. I tried to look as human as possible, communicating a lot and just watching how the humans were starting to fall apart.</p><p><strong>Finola’s death</strong></p><p>Chun took the mush sample and went to spend her time in a turret. For me this was great as antimush research would be delayed. Then next thing I know is that Roland is trying to kill Finola because Finola picked a camera on bravo dorm shelve to bring to medlab. Roland injured Finola and she had to go to surgery. I was thinking of doing some social engineering to try to convince one that the other must be mush but I didn’t have to since Finola admitted to having another account claiming she could have more accounts as long as she didn’t play on the same ship. I told her she was wrong and that she could only have one account and she proceeded to say she would delete this one and said goodbye. She died of depression on day 3 and I’m going to count that one as a kill for the mush team. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Gioele’s death</strong></p><p>We were on the middle of day 3 and Stephen kept being silent so I decided to remove two more spores and trap alpha and bravo bay, hoping Roland would catch at least one of those spores. Roland was the one being more active and I was feeling sorry for him in a ship with so many humans being inactive or not doing much and wanted to bring him to the mush side. And while I was waiting for hunters to come and him to take off I noticed that Gioele went to engine room ro reset Pilgred. And stayed there during cycle change. Some time later I see on the mush channel that one of my trapped shelves spored someone… Who? The silent Jin Su that went to engine room to hit Gioele and was now with 2 spores. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Gioele had been staying in the engine room for 2 or 3 cycles and Raluca had to leave to a turret to be safe. So as day 3 started I went to the engine room to give 2 hands to Jin Su, one to welcome him to mush, the other to kill Gioele that was acting so mushy… ops, seems he was a human. Kill 2 for the mush team. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Framing Janice and outing one mush</strong></p><p>In the meanwhile, my initial mush fellow had given signs of life and had decided to sabotage some things on the ship (a turret and a patrol ship I think which removed the spore i had placed on alpha bay) and to cook as much food as possible (he was doing this even before mush were assigned…). Not exactly discreet but due to a general low activity of humans no one was rallying to kill him until… Janice that hadn’t say a word and was all the time in nexus had turned of death notifications, turned off the AI inhibitors and started moving around. I thought it would be a great time to try to blame her as mush and was following her around. I saw she went to center bravo storage and did nothing there. But I also saw there was a pilot book on the shelf so I hide it and then used my free search to find it again. Since no one had gone there for ages I could try to blame her for hiding the book. But I kept tracking her steps and that lead me to the refectory… big mistake! Stephen had spored in front of an idle Kuan Ti and it was visible in the logs. I waited at least one hour thinking what I could do, if I didn’t tell the crew about it my cover that I had been working so hard to keep could be blown. Janice had been in the refectory before me, cooked twice and left, not saying a word. My fellow mushes were offline so after thinking for a while I decided to open a chat with Roland and tell him I knew who the two mushes were: Stephen because he had spored and Janice because she was on the room after the spore, said nothing, hide a book, changed bios settings and cooked more than once reducing our rations even more. And I also said that Janice should be the first one to die, so that I could be neron admin and change the settings correctly, hoping with this to save some more time for Stephen, so that he could help our cause more before being killed.</p>

                <p><strong>Janice and Stephen</strong></p><p>Hua and Roland eventually attacked Janice and ops, of course she was human too. One more kill indirectly caused by me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> At this point Roland asked me to explain myself since I had said Janice was mush and she wasn’t. But in fact, Janice behavior was so bad that if I was human I would have pushed for her dead… but never before the confirmed mush Stephen. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> After this, Frieda enters the kitchen and finds Stephen mutated. She, Paola and Hua eventually manage to kill Stephen and finally get one mush down. At this point Chao and Terrence had died of starvation so there were 5 humans dead and just one mush.</p><p><strong>Raluca’s conversion</strong></p><p>Jin Su and I were discussing who to bring to our side next. I still would have liked to convert Roland but he was staying in the camera protected alpha dorm all the time so we went for an easy target: Raluca. Jin Su spored her once during day 3, I went to the engine room to “reset Pilgred” and trap the engine room. By the end of day 3 she had two spores on her and the next day Jin Su finished her conversion and took anonymush. So on day 4, we were back to 3 mush and just one showing in the bar. I felt a bit bad because being Raluca’s first ship, she wasn’t totally aware of how vulnerable she was to being converted. But I was happy to bring one more human to the winning side, if I could I would bring them all. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>The grand finale!</strong></p><p>After this, we started thinking it was time for the great mush show off. There were just 4 active humans left (Roland, Frieda, Paola and Hua) and morale was starting to be a problem. So of course Jin Su announced a speech in bravo dorm during cycle 8. Ian was also idling in bravo dorm, so it wasn’t the best place for the massacre but considering there were some people there already it would be too suspicious to change location. But as we waited for the right time, Ian stopped being idle and went to sleep in medlab! To help with the finale, I decided to assemble the rocket launcher, I had the tube from dismantling the shower the day before (it was supposed to be for the sofa but that was never built), there were scraps in alpha bay 2 that Roland had gathered. And the BP was luckily in the engine room. So Raluca brought the scraps to the engine room, I brought the tube, quickly assembled it and went back to the dorm to wait.</p><p>As the time approached we were getting impatient and Jin Su and I decided to start the plan a little earlier. I went to get the knife and waited in bravo bay. The grenade was in bravo bay and Jin Su came to grab it and went back to to throw the grenade. As soon as he did it, he left the dorm and I entered to throw the rocket. Roland was dead right away. I grabbed the knife and stabbed Paola until she died (and got a torn tongue with it). Then Jin Su shot and stabbed Frieda but she wasn’t going down so easily. As we were waiting for Raluca for backup, Frieda woke up and decided to attack me once. She barely did any damage and left the room right after. As far as we could track her, she went to medlab to stay with Ian… Raluca had come to help us in the meanwhile and the three of us just laid down for a bit because a new day was about to start.</p><p>At the day change, 2 more deads… Kuan Ti and… Ian! Frieda was now unprotected but for good measure, Jin Su threw a rocket and her and she died right after. Only two humans left… Hua and Chun. Raluca went to alpha dorm to try to kill Hua, she did great damage but couldn’t finish the job so Jin Su gave me a mission and I was able to finish her. Just Chun left, idling in a turret. I removed spores and phagocyte and went to the turret to kill Chun. She was also hard to take down and Jin Su had to come to my help. He shot her but she was still standing. So we were left with a game of patience, I had the rocket launcher again and was waiting patiently for next cycle… and Chun died of starvation. So Raluca, Jin Su and I were finally alone and we just had to wait until neron finished us. Out job was done.</p><br><p><strong>Some final notes:</strong> (in case you actually read this <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)<br><strong>Roland:</strong> I really wish I could have turned you. You were so active and helpful. You and Hua did a great job keeping the hull intact until day 4. Sorry for tricking and lying so much to you. I hope we get to be on the same ship one other time, preferably with less inactives/griefers and on the same side (same for everyone else active actually).</p><p><strong>Raluca: </strong>I hope you ended having some fun on the ship and will continue to play mush. I can assure you that you’ll find ships with more active crew and where it’s fun to play as human or mush. Any question you may have, feel free to PM me.</p><p><strong>Jin Su: </strong>At one point I doubted if it had been a good idea to spike first because you were so silent on the main channel but you ended being a great mush partner.</p><p><strong>Thread name: </strong>I was planning on writing this as neron after the killing spree started but my torn tongue prevented this. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>The list!</strong> I was happy no one asked me to print the list because I was afraid to see my name on it. Specially as people kept dying. By curiosity on the last cycle after everyone was dead I went to print it and: <em>At the very least one of them were an agent of Mush when we fled Xyloph. I'd bet my life on it... Janice , Jin Su , Gioele , Eleesha and Stephen . But which one…</em></p>
