                <p>Hey team, this ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4548" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4548</a></p><p>I was Frieda, and an Alpha, with Jin as my partner.</p><p>I'm starting to get smarter about being Mush; soon as I knew what I and my partner was, I sent him a PM letting him know I meant to play a long game (at least not immediately berserk) and to act as human as I thought I should until I saw a victory chance high enough to risk getting caught - and that I hoped he'd join me, but if he wouldn't, please would he be sure to spike at least one person during his murder run (and not kill them, of course), with my preferred targets being 1) Ian or 2) Janice.</p><p>Jin said he was willing to play a slow game, then he went mostly inactive (ooh! Well, that is a way to play slow...)</p><p>My first scan found a 16 zone O2 volcano otherstuff planet; volcano found with 3 zones left unexplored. I gladly and honestly reported that, saying that I'd save it as our emergency O2 planet.</p><p>My second scan was a 4 zone O2 safestuff planet, an actual 'one person with the compass should go, no possible chance of any harm or loss'. I reported that too, just dishonestly, with another random zone in place of the O2, and gladly deleted it.</p><p>The rest of my scans were trash planets, and I honestly reported and deleted them.</p><p>The D2 bananas were not planted until D2C8; a bit of nexus got rushed but not so much research. I was fine with anything; I wasn't going to make spores or do anything that seemed un-human or un-reasonable until I had a very good reason. But it was late D2 before antispore gas was up. No matter; I wasn't making spores anyway. Neither was Jin.</p><p>We had a D2 fire, which Jin was around for; we both searched part of the ship, but no humans did. I urged him to not search everywhere, just report honestly where he did look, and report honestly if he found it; then I went to bed. Several cycles later it had spread once; Some humans had reported looking for them, no one had found it. I found one, predicted the location of the other, reported that information, and went back to bed. Mmm, yummy AP - I had a bed. By Janice. So sweet. And I had it all game. Janice shared some time in the other dorm, but she was mostly in bed beside me. So little morale reaching humans, mmmmm so sweet.</p><p>Late D3, Paola was inactive, Jin was inactive, Eleesha had been quarantined, so Stephen, alone on a camera-less bridge, was now comms officer and commander. He had already thrown inactive Jin and Paola around, and had gotten Jin into the lab and Paola into front storage. We had a merchant trying to trade with us, wanting a player for Pilgred.</p><p>I decided to get at least one of D3 spores into him, made both the D3 spores under the guise of dirty while eating, went back to shower, got to the bridge, checked for a suddenly there camera about a hundred times, then spiked him. Some thought later, spiked a coffee he'd dropped on the shelf. Scanned and reported garbage planets a tiny bit, then back to bed.</p><p>By the time I had some AP again, Stephen had drank my second spore. I was not as high AP as I'd like to be, but the Pilgred trade wasn't done yet, so I used phagocyte to get the third spore to him and in him, not even doing anything planets, just grabbing Anonymush (I'd also taken splashproof, phagocyte, and fungal kitchen). But there was a chance, a chance; he could quickly sell Paola and then jump us to Sol, given that he had the 4 AP to do both things. Better than a transfer to him; what if he lacked the AP?</p><p>Gave Stephen detailed information in the PM he was invited into; he cooperated, but Jin came back too, getting commander title. Jin didn't understand how to jump to Sol and logged off before he could be explained to, but spend a lot of AP doing I dunno what, so he Kept the title.</p><p>Humans got upset about Pilgred; Janice checked the engine room, saw dirty Raluca there, a sofa BP, a scrap metal, and freaked out; she slew Raluca. She explained that she hadn't realized that the sofa was already built on the bridge and she thought Raluca was doing all sorts of mushy stuff, but that was a second sofa BP she now understood.</p><p>I planned with Stephen; sooner or later either he would get the AP to hack, I would get the AP to hack (I had 3 more AP then him, and as IT expert my odds were great), or he would get Commander back from Jin being killed so we could move or from Jin just going inactive; but wait and let humans do everything. We only needed Stephen -or- me alive to win; it was more important to keep cover then rush. I made sure he understood how to win without me, that he understood how I would win without him, and then we waited until I had 9 AP - Jin was still listed as active, but wasn't with us - and then I got the hacker kit that still wasn't being held and took us home. Only cost 2 AP for the hack, too. But I wasn't going to risk not having enough when I was in to spend 2 more to get back to Sol.</p>
