                <p>Jin Su here. Yes, <em>I was Mush</em> from day 2 onwards and I am horribly ashamed for abusing the trust of my crew mates. Well, perhaps, that's not quite true. I loved it.</p><p>This was an interesting ship. We had a relatively large number of active, yet inexperienced players. First big mistake was that Bravo Dorm had no cameras. I started out as a normal human, but the alphas <em>Terrence and Roland got to convert me to Mushhood</em>. I was surprised, because at that time I slept in monitored Alpha dorm, long after having left unmonitored Bravo Dorm. Terrence uninstalled the camera in Bravo Dorm (!) and then proceeded to convert me to Mushhood. As it turned out, Terrence had also spiked in front of his Mush buddy Roland, leaving a big red blotch of Mushiness in the logs.</p><p>Terrence decided to go to the Nexus and transform there. Frieda attacked him in the Nexus and almost killed him. If the humans would have succeeded, they would immediately see an extra Mush, because Terrence had Anonymush. In the Mush channel, Terrence and I agreed on a drastic action. <em>I would be the one to kill Terrence</em>, resulting in two big benefits: 1) me immediately choosing Anonymush and hiding our real strength and 2) ingratiating myself with the humans. We said our goodbyes and Terrence bravely bared his neck while I struck him with a lead pipe. Sad, but glorious.</p><p>It worked like a charm and <em>allowed me to set up an inner council of trusted members</em>: Frieda, Chun, Paola, Raluca and myself.</p><p>First thing that worked the Mush way, was that Hua was outside fighting hunters. I set an ultimatum and threatened to fly the ship away if she did not return. The crew fell in and gave support to this ultimatum. Thus, we flew, <em>leaving one of the most valuable pilots behind</em>.</p><p>When we arrived at the planet, I intended to choose Traitor and go with the crew down to the planet. However, I made a big mistake in my AP calculation because <em>I forgot that Mush cannot get AP from food</em>. There I was in Icarus Bay, with 0 MP / 0 AP. I had to make up an excuse for having nothing at all, so "my belly was already filled with other food". How unfortunate. If we could delay the expedition with 3 cycles so I could get my AP.</p><p>The expedition crew was extremely impatient and very driven for results. An admirable bunch of good people, that's for sure. They got the whole thing going with Stephen as the candidate pilot, and me sleeping in Alpha Dorm. While the expedition was on the ground, <em>Roland and I tried to draft a quick plan for leaving them all behind on the planet</em>. He would load up 1 fuel and bring me a pill for +3 AP. The fuel was loaded, but when I took the pill, it had no result at all. Darn, and the logs were a trail of incriminating evidence. Shortly thereafter the crew came back and if they would see the logs, that would surely raise eyebrows.</p><p>So, that's when I decided to tell that I was talking to Roland, getting him to cooperate. The crew was suspicious of him because of his inactivity and strange behaviour. I told them I asked Roland to bring me a morale pill, but he brought the wrong one. Sounds quite implausible, doesn't it? Somehow, it didn't sound implausible enough. <em>I was not suspected</em>. Pfew. We quickly moved out of orbit, where new hunters awaited us. Roland shot down a single hunter and the armor kept being pummelled, all the way down to the thirties.</p><p>At that point, Stephen stepped into a patrol ship and destroyed all hunters. He failed to report he was outside. Frieda had just discovered a new planet and it was okayed by the crew. <em>Great chance to get rid of yet another pilot</em> and navigate the Daedalus into a new danger spot, now that this one was too safe. This would leave only reluctant Roland and me to deal with the threat. Two unwilling pilots.</p><p>We arrived at the planet with a grand total of 14 hunters. The crew already suspected Roland of being Mush. But now, after my abandonment of Stephen (which I pinned on him not reporting being outside), <em>I was also under scrutiny</em>. I noticed the chatter going down considerably and I saw that private channels were opened in which I was not involved.</p><p>To "help" me with my morale issue, <em>they were trying to make me eat a banana and a pill together</em>, in the same cycle. The game has a rule that makes Mush feel satisfied after everything they eat, whereas a human can eat a banana and a pill in the same cycle. When I stated I still had the morale pill on me to help others out, the chatter almost completely died down.</p><p>I offered to give a number of speeches in Alpha Dorm. Roland and I were busy scheming against the crew, <em>organizing a grand demoralization campaign</em>. Frieda has been a bit too forthright about her morale situation, so we thought we could off her with one action. Roland attacked Frieda and Chun for respectively -2 and -4 morale. I attacked Paola for -6 morale. Paola died, Chun and Frieda lived. Roland and I decided to unmask him as a Mush and also frame him for the death of Paola. The idea was that I was still in the trusted group and could coordinate with them the counter-attack.</p><p>The ship was <em>down to 10 hull</em> and we still had to convert Raluca. So we decided to fly again, to delay the inevitable with yet another cycle. Roland loaded up the fuel and I flew the Daedalus out or orbit. Raluca was converted to the cause just one cycle before everything went to hell. It ended with a bang and shattered dreams for humanity.</p><p>Kudos to my team mate Roland for his boldness, Terrence for his understanding and Chun, Frieda, Finola Stephen and Raluca for their great teamplay.</p>

                <p>It was an interesting game to say the least. It got to apoint where everyone was under scrutiny for being mush. When you ann roland were both unwilling to take the test and so many excuses not to be around it all got much too fishy. I was more than expecting to be converted by then, although I expected at least one of the spores to have come from Terrence when he was in my engine room for no reason. All in all, good fun, good ship</p>
