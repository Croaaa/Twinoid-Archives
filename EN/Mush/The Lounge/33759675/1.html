                <p>Chandra,were you Frieda or Paola?<br>Dr. Fi here by the way <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Well to write a little more about this ship,its safe to say this was the most paranoid ship I've ever been on <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This ship started on the MMM jump day,and things were looking good,seemed like we have 15 active player at the start(turned out to be around 12)...</p><p>On the first day Chao and Hua killed the captain (after discussing it with with with others) because Jin Su picked up a knife and got defensive about it saying he has the right to it as a cpt. and he 'seemed' suspicious,ohh and Raluca somewhy decided to sleep in the dorm and he cut her with that knife accidentaly,so that was the first day for us,Chao became the new cpt of the ship.</p><p>Second day with the help of a lots of player we were progressing with the anti-mush research like crazy,and it was time to place the Myco-alarms but Chun was kind of unresponsive so they just sitted in the lab and we were trying to figure it out whom to trust with it when Hua suddenly took 2 of them and went to the medlab..This seems silly now but back then taking them without announcing and hiding it were suspicious,we searched the room to find the alarms and Chao thought she might have hid both of the alarms in the same room to sabotage their effectiveness..</p><p>After that a little later I searched the room as well and found another myco alarm,she left the room,went to the B-dorm where ou weapons were and dropped her walkie to pick up as much weapon andd armor she could <img src="../../../../gfx/square/eek.png" alt="8O" class="tid_ico"><br>That kind of scared everyone at the time and the team decided its time to make the natamy,so I started working on it and with the help of Roland and a mission from the cpt. we finished it in a few minutes,and they went and killed poor Hua...<br>Later Janice told me it was her who told Hua to take the alarms,since she saw that she is sick and thus not a mush...<br>So 2 humans down no mush yet...</p><p>On the 3rd day we wanted to start already with the expeditons but Frieda proved to be completly useless in her job drawing attention to her...<br>In the end someone came up witha suitable planet and at the end of the day Chao gave the order to go full speed ahead....to the opposite direction....<br>Ha said someone told him the planet is that way,but he went inactive and didn't came up for 17 h so Janice decided its time to get a new captain or we will suffocate...poor Chao was human of course but we couldn't wait any longer..Gioele as a new cpt. yay <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Frieda suddenly came up with a nice planet with oxigen and 5 fuel cost and was ignored completly by everyone,and we went to the planet Eleesha found (around 5 O2 remaining...)</p><p>In the mean while the resaerch went smoothly,I made an extremly good progress and had the idea<br>to start tetsting the crew with the spore sucker,so we could find the mush and stop killing each other..<br>Janice died the next day,a horrible accident on the expo,but the oxigen were secured for a while for those who remained...</p><p>We wanted to do the tests,but barely managed to test me by Roland who became sick,so I could conduct the test on others...I was ordered by the cpt. to take the shrink book and save the day,but paola who had the book cut all contact withme,not answering and went to the dorm saving Raluca instead of me...Chun died from depression...</p><p>So that was suspicious for me,but got the tests going,tested Kuan Ti and Raluca,both humans,so 4 humans we were sure of including me...things got more ugly at this part...<br>Eleesha told Roland to do the thing with her because she has 1 morale,but he was afraid from her and passed the chance,and Eleesha didn't die at the day change,making Roland more suspicious...<br>At this point we killed Frieda whom we knew was mush..<br>I wanted to test Eleesha too,but we somehow missed each other with a few minutes and the ship was on the verge of exploding,the 3 of us decided to risk it since we probably die anyway if noone comes up,fist target became Elee,silly idea because she was a human and if we manage to do the test in time,we might had a better ending...</p><p>She wasn't mush,only 3 suspects remained,Terrence,Paola and Gioele..<br>At this point Roland wanted to off Gioele for playing too good,but he was at my side helping me the whole time,so I knew he cannot be mush,and we went for Terrence because he most of thetime idled in rooms without camera(at this point we knew Jannice trusted her and that he had a mental illnes earlier,we just couldn't think straight,Raluca said Paola couldn't be it because she is such a nice shrink and saved her from dying,on the other hand noona realy knew what Terrence spent his Ap other than building the sofa)<br>We offed Terence at this point who was of course human... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So,we waited a cycle to get some energy and wanted to go for Paola,I was still sure that Gioele can't be the mush and only they remained..<br>But then Gioele came up and didn't say word,after a while we saw him dropping his talkie...then he went to the room next to the dorms...and we kind of freak out imagining him starting a rampage since we knew he had the knife,and noone knew where the natamy rifle was,or the grenade exact location,so we jumped at him at the same time and killed him....poor old bastard,I always liked him <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"><br>I took the knife from his dead hands and slit Paola's throat after that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"><br>Thats how we hunted down the mush,it was extremly sad.....<br>Well Raluca and Kuan died from moral loss at the day change,Roland and me died after the hull finally gave away....we deserved that I guess...</p>

                <p>The adventure of Hua was short but I died IRL from laughter after I died in game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Day 1.8: I wake up 20 seconds before the day changes and waste a hero day <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Day 2: So now I sit in the medlab for a while to wander about life and what to do on the ship. Obviously I get a message from Rolland to kill hunters, which was obviously a good move to start the game. So I go and take off with my mad skills to fight the hunters, surprisingly I discover that Roland only used 3 shots and then stopped and did nothing so I kill the remaining 3 hunters and go for sleep.</p><p>The rest of the day had a lot of messages (really a ton of them, until you're done reading and refresh there would be more). The top of the things that I remember happening are: Raluca moving cameras without reason...Giole repeating in every message that he was never in a dorm which I could see in the logs that he did... Giole constantly asking people to go check logs in rooms and what not... Jin Su stabbing poor Raluca with a knife to get her off bed after discussing with Chao not to hit her because Chao had the wrestler skill!... Terrence idling in a storage with the sofa blueprint and the other materials for it... Roland running around the ship doing odd jobs for him and going for sleep... Frieda getting dirty "from a ration" and going back to bridge until next day...</p><p>Then Jin Su came back, started ordering people around and making no sense and filling the place with messages. We asked him to keep the inventory updated and drop the knife, but he first didn't admit he had it and then claimed he should keep it and will not drop it because he's is roleplaying a dictator or something in that style. I really thought he should die but calmed down for a while because that would be going too far. Just a few moments after I calmed down, I got invited together with Janice/Finola/Frieda to a channel where Giole and Chao were discussing to kill Jin Su. After letting them discuss it even further they were still planning to kill him, however they were hesitating and didn't want to be labelled for his death so I jumped in and started shooting! Chao jumped in as well but got injured and I had to finish Jin Su off because we didn't want any half measures. That's how the first human died.</p><p>Day 3: This day was more peaceful and we were trying to do research and projects while terrence was sitting this time in the bravo bay, later chao joined him in the bay and became a big suspect along with giole in my eyes. I had contracted a disease after killing Jin Su which we cured and I hoped I could now be more trusted by the others. Later in the evening, when I noticed that the mycoalarms were completed and there was nobody in the medlab, I decided I'll go take the alarms and hide one in the medlab and sleep there a few cycles. I have no idea where they were discussing who can be trusted to hide them, I never saw anything about that. From the moment that I took the mycoalarms there immediately appeared a lot of messages about how suspicious I am and that I am not to be trusted. I had no time to reply to all of them and blamed Giole for letting everybody know that I probably hid a mycoalarm in the medlab. Immediately Chao appeared as well and found the alarm and picked it up and left. Obviously in panic I say he's a mush and came to infect me and that's why he went into trouble to search and pick up the alarm (seriously if there's an alarm in the room do not pick it up). I decide to hide the other alarm now that Chao is gone and lie down again but realise it's not a good choice because I need to leave and will be offline for some time. In result, I decide to flee for my life away from Chao and grab all the weapons and hope he can not kill me until humans come back and save me from him. After being shot with the natamy rifle for 6 damage(reduced with armor) I got punched to death by Roland (This guy killed more people than hunters on the ship from what I can see). <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>LOL, oh man. The <em>nutcracker</em>. Why did you guys waste AP killing Gioele? He died in Alpha Bay *2*, going away from you in Alpha Dorm. I was, by the way, trying to save your asses by finding the scrap metal. Since you didn't seem to be doing much about the ship about to blow up. No, let's attack the old man who doesn't fight back. That's what the whole ship was into, anyway.</p><p>Even if I hadn't dropped the walkie talkie, you guys remember that there's more than one medical condition and status that *silences* players? The post it notes are all the way in Icarus Bay, what did you want me to do! But really, the computer really did break up on me, to the point where I couldn't open any chat tabs. IF the game loaded. So to give you all a fighting chance, <strong>I dropped the Hacking Kit</strong>. A LONG LONG LONG time before I was able to log back on to stroll to my apparent demise to the bloodthirsty mob. Of course when I wake up, the Hacking Kit is still there, and you're all killing each other in the dorms. Very sophisticated gameplay <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":tid_razz:" class="tid_ico"> I'm pretty sure people were in and out of the lab, and you never checked the shelves.</p><p>Inventory, inventory, inventory. Couldn't secure the Refectory, or do basic things like check rooms for items. That and we could just never get a hold of Chun. When the items aren't tracked, of course you can start cooking up ideas of where the grenade and rifle are.</p><p>And by the way, I said Gioele hadn't been in the dorms since the first day, which was all the way true. If our sprinters (or any of the millions of people in Bravo Dorm) had confirmed it, you could see I wasn't lying about any place I went. I left Bravo Dorm that night and <em>never returned</em>. To either dorm. Thus I could never have gotten a shower EVER. Therefore if I was clean, <em>I was clean the whole time</em> until the end when I heated up some food and got dirty.</p><p>Hua, regular crew almost never place the mycoalarms themselves. So much as moving a mycoalarm will get you shot on sight on most active crews, and reaching mycoalarm usually means they are. That, and I had no idea you even had a disease.</p><p>EDIT: Terrence, you were suspected because I saw how you organized the ship before we all got there. Then you stopped posting in the Inventory Thread that you started. And languished in Front Storage, when you get free MP from almost anybody in the crew. Same with Frieda, though hers were way more obvious. Every time we could get people to agree on Frieda, we'd gotten distracted and were out of AP. Hua probably retroactively doomed us by leaving it all to one pilot.</p><p>I still want to know why Jin Su went off the deep end. In the end I told the PM that he might be human, but we couldn't have a commander who deflected about something so important.</p><p>For that matter, why so many players choosing to be shady at the same time?! That was just screwed up, and that's putting it mildly.</p><p>Had fun flirting with Dr. Fi and Roland, haha. I <em>did</em> suspect Paola, but by the time we had an effective test for her, everything went to hell again. Like I said, first people to be tested would be Raluca and the bridge crew. Never came to pass, like a lot of things. The Shrink book was a massive chance on my part, and I knew it could backfire, but I just didn't have enough inventory slots, and I was pretty sure I was on the Bridge with one or two Mush. Hah!</p>

What was that, Day Five? I'd slept on the sofa for untold cycles, and seen you standing right there. Not exactly, well, <em>tracking</em>. And it's a valid Mush strategy to start sabotaging your own job description, so you were kind of one step ahead of Raluca in terms of doing Shady Things and then Getting Defensive about it.</p>

                <p>LOL, I didn't order any of those hits. We discussed it for a long, long time. Janice was the one who wanted to get rid of Chao. The reason I gave that first huge order was because Chao had tourettes and couldn't talk, and everyone else was offline.</p><p>And that's a *we*. More than one person. If you go and do something on your own, and five people have <em>no idea why</em>, guess what'll happen? We can't distinguish you from a griefer. The reason I stayed in one place was because I was helping Finola with the research and tending the plants for oxygen. Meanwhile, all the people with AP and MP were all, we have nothing to do. If I'd just taken that sprinter book earlier, I would have done the checking myself, and then what? You all suspect me of being mush anyway.</p><p>And by the way. I was in the dorm at the same time as mush was assigned. And Jin Su was awake and talking to me, and never reported me as dirty at any moment. And then after that, I spent all my AP walking up to the Research Lab because Finola called me. Tell me when and where I could have gotten a shower to cover up sporing?</p>

When there were 2 mush around, and there's only 2 witnesses, y'know, we who are sitting on the other side of the ship want some *proof*, because that's a pretty serious action and a crazy allegation if not true. If Jin Su had just come clean when he did it, when several of us were online when it happened and he was talking to us, there would have been no problem. His actions were what ultimately decided the trigger-men. Not our little conference.</p>

                <p>That, and after we discover that Hua hides two mycoalarms on top of each other, we were pretty sure we made the right choice.</p><p>Addendum: The other reason I played it safe for the whole game was the command structure. Sure, Chao is just ahead of me, although I did beg him to stay on the Bridge, and he continued to rove around the ship.</p><p>But the person after me was Stephen. Who checked in mid-game, restarting the inactivity clock. Who we never cleared of being mush, until he did keel over. And I knew how much of an AP drain the Hacking Kit was, and who do you guys trust with it? Finola and Roland, neither of whom can be spared for that.</p><p>And then after that I just had no AP left to move given I had triple duty.
