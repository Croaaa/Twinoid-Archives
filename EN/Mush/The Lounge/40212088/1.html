                <p>Derek here. This was an MMM ship. (Or it formed during that time at least.)</p><p>Prior to MUSH selection, Stephen and I were talking about if both of us were MUSH how we should do a dual-wrestling rampage. (Because that would be awesome.)</p><p>Right after MUSH selection, Chun murders Frieda. Frieda was asleep and Chun killed her and took her bed. Well, not the best start. We had to kill Chun (who was silent), but the MUSH didn't take advantage of the situation, which was decent. (I would have just grabbed grenades and took out the dorm she was in as that would essentially nullify her griefing, but I'm a jerk.)</p><p>We had some really crappy NERON projects to start with. Until Plasma Shield popped up. Raluca was a Genius, so we were set! Ian joked about how we should make the Pneumatic Distributor....<br>Then the Pneumatic Distributor was finished.</p><p>Well, needless to say the crew was ready to kill someone. Fortunately, it turned out to be Stephen, our first Alpha MUSH who had copied Raluca's genius skill and used it to complete the junky project and block us from Plasma Shield. (A rather interesting plan.) He also read our Biologist book.</p><p>He didn't do much else though, even though we had a grenade, and TWO grenade BPs. Well, this must be answered for! So, after some people smacked him a bit, we came up with another interesting idea: Turn of the inhibitors and grenade HIM!<br>So, I used Wrestler to toss him form the dorm and ran out and used it! At this point, he came clean about him being a MUSH, and asked just how many injuries can one person have. I responded as any good MUSH hunter would: I said "Let's find out." and then promptly shot him with a blaster.<br>Which killed him. One down, one to go. We also had Raluca use Genius on the cure. (So it was used for something good at least.)</p><p>We then carried on. Three of our pilots didn't talk much. Hua and Roland, both of whom actually shot down hunters, and Andie who used turrets instead. (And did Glory research instead of normal research.) She was all but inactive, UNTIL we did our first expo, then she came awake used a turret to shoot down one hunter, ran into Bravo Dorm (with the shower) ran out (without doing anything) and went to Icarus Bay. (She was ONLY a pilot, keep in mind.)<br>Odd behavior to be sure. She started the expo with 9 health and it went a little bad. (Not super bad.) Well, we killed her as soon as we landed. (And by we, I mean me.) Not a MUSH. (I'd really like to know why she ran in and out of a shower room.)</p><p>One 'pilot' down. Our hull at this point was taking some dings. And we didn't have Plasma Shield. Roland went out to shoot down hunters, and didn't land. (And didn't say when he'd land or anything, frankly.) There were still hunters outside and we were at a planet, so we couldn't even scan. Now, this wouldn't be a problem, EXCEPT that he got sick on an expo.<br>(Janice also got sick, but from Ian not reporting that some fruit caused sicknesses, and she ate one. A rather devious food test. Especially when one of the illnesses was Psychotic Episodes...)<br>So, do we abandon a human, or wait? Well, we waited for cycle change, and he didn't land. It was late at night and most people were asleep IRL, and for all we knew he might be also. So, rather than risk us taking more damage and having him not land for another cycle, I moved the ship. (By hacking.)<br>I'm not happy about it, but what can we do? (Also, we had warned our pilots earlier that they should always land, so there's also that.)</p><p>Well, when I get up in the morning, I find that Hua, our last non-talking pilot had also went outside, and Jin had moved the ship and abandoned her. <br>Fortunately, she was our last Alpha MUSH. Well, probably, because unfortunately, we had a third MUSH! So, Hua had taken AnonyMUSH. The question was, was Hua converted or did she convert someone.</p><p>We discussed it and figured that since Stephen had been in the area with Raluca (to copy her skill) that Hua had probably converted her. (Ian mentioned that Raluca had mentioned Hua entering a storage room that she was in.) So, we figured that Raluca was probably a MUSH. So, we cured her. (Remember, that ironically she had Geniused the cure earlier. Not that she had much choice in the matter.)<br>Raluca told us that we were clean (which Eleesha confirmed) and that Hua was a quiet MUSH as well. (Raluca had gone effectively silent and had isolated herself in the Engine Room, which we had taken as suspicious. Another reason we cured her, was we were worried about a possible fourth MUSH rushing the Pilgred with her.)</p><p>MUSH clear, we were safe! Except that RNG decided that now it could randomly set fires almost every day (on half the ship) and have huge hunter waves. Well, we managed to stay alive, but sadly it was too much for our two pilots and our crew to manage to get starmap pieces (we found one) and with 17 (or less) hull left we returned to Sol.</p>

                <p>Hello there, Crew. <br>I was Jin Su here. Maybe not so active as a captain should be, but tried to be on when I was needed. <br>It was really good ship and it was a pleasure to be with you all on it. Too bad we had to deal with things like Killer Chun and big hunters wave from the very beginning. Seems like a Mush Danger wasn't enough to keep us occupied. <br>I can understand why Stephen decided to act like that... With Hua as a partner he couldn't do much. Still I hate him for taking away from us a Plasma Shield. I'm really happy that I was able to run, before he finished transfer. <br>I must say most of the people did they job amazing. I love ships where Paola is so hard working with Neron upgrades. Derek and Ian did amazing when searching for the other mush - sorry for taking fun from you. I really checked the map a few times before moving the ship, but Hua had to leave it in a moment I was pushing the button. So... Bad luck for Mushes, good for Jin Su. <br>I still think Ian had some killer instinct. Hunting people, poisoning them, taking care for plants more than for humans! One crazy bastard! I still feel sorry for losing you just before getting back to Sol - I guess that really deserve to be in the Fail Thread. <br>It was also fun to read all those talks between Derek, Janice and Neron. <br>Anyway... Just wanted to thank you for those who were active and helped us to reach day 16. I must say it wasn't the ship I imagined it would be after joining in the time of MMM - but taking the circumstance... we were amazing.</p>
