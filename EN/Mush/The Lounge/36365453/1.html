                <p>It feels so strange to not have to log in before each cycle change, Im feeling very restless...<br>Jin Su here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> For those who missed the ending - as planned, we were all supposed to meet mid-cycle 6 at the Bridge for an epic speech, group photo and historic 'push of the button'. However Raluca went offline with the medkit and we had work out a Plan B in case people in the dorms could not be healed before cycle change. Hua rushed to fix the command terminal and dropped off a vitamin bar to give me the stregth to 'push' <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Suddenly, with 15 minutes to spare, Raluca showed up and ran to the dorms with the medkit. The game was freezing up for me so much, I had a 30 second lag with each refresh, we were scrambling in the dorms trying to heal everyone in time and communicating by pm like crazy. <br>With 18 seconds on the clock and no update on statuses, I felt I had to push the button. The game froze for several minutes (kept closing and opening different browsers trying to understand what had happened) and I for a long while didn't know if I'd launched us to Eden in time or if I was too late and we had casualties at cycle change or if all had been healed and I had been too hasty. DID WE heal everyone? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Raluca here. Truly, this was a magnificent voyage, setting off on the first day of the month and ending on the last. We started, as such things tend to, with a mush hunt, gradually identifying who the potentials were. and regrettably coming up with a couple of false positives. Gioele, we owe a collective apology to. Less so to Roland, who was <em>so sure</em> that he hadn't left any sign that he was a mush, and who was planning on staying incognito.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, the list of suspects shrank to the critical point. He was rightfully killed, and I used my genius to instantly produce the cure, which was administered to the last remaining suspect, Jin Su. Fortuitous, as it turned out, as once his humanity was restored, our commander was a round-the-clock rock about whom our journey was built.</p><p>We had a couple of inactives: Stephen and Chun, the latter of whom we kept alive for a few days, the former we, er, didn't. We had one active player die after we had switched to the expeditions phase, namely Eleesha, a victim of shoddy construction and poorly reported health. We had no less than sixteen hundred-post threads documenting everyone's vital statistics, and hers was the last fatality.</p><p>Once PILGRED was repaired, shortly after the Mush were dealt with, I picked up a botany mage book, helping to grow our ever-larger Bumpjunkin farm alongside Hua and Ian, safeguarding the pots through each cycle change whilst running about fixing things, repairing doors and putting out fires, The botany skill also helped on expeditions: I was one of many crewmates who reached double figures on away teams. I 'got lost' once (I was staying behind on the planet to keep Frieda company, that's my story and I'm sticking to it!) but no-one was ultimately left behind.</p><p>The quest for map pieces was long and arduous: Every single crystalite vein we visited was a mush trap, else someone got lost. We racked up a phenomenal amount of artifacts, with piles of alien can openers in easy reach of every technician, globs of circuit jelly in the nexus, ironically a few days after we'd completed all possible research, and so many water sticks that we eventually used them as chaff on expeditions after our post-its got burnt.</p><p>Romance blossomed on board ship: Kuan Ti read a psychology mage book, which promoted him up to 'tolerable' in Raluca's eyes, since spending time with him didn't make her actively unhappy. The Captain and Frieda got along exceptionally well as well, I'll let the others fill in any details they wish to add on this front.</p><p>The end came about one cycle earlier than we were planning for: There was a mad dash to try and get everyone out of single figures in health towards the end of the penultimate cycle. Unfortunately there were a couple of folks too injured to risk the turnover, so with literally seconds to spare, the Captain punched in the jump to Eden, guaranteeing that all eleven of us made it.</p><p>It was a truly magnificent endeavour. Everyone put in an amazing shift, doing their jobs and quite often someone elses'. No matter how bad it got, we remained on top, keeping everyone healthy. putting out fires, fixing the most vital broken things cycle after cycle. I won't forget putting out six out of eight fires in a single cycle, that's for sure.</p><p>So, ladies and gentlemen of the lounge, I give you the finest crew of the Daedalus yet to fly. At time of writing we have a monopoly on the Glory top 3, five out of the top eight, and every one of the Eden eleven is the highest-rated exemplar of their character. Beat that!</p>

                <p>Chao. <br>Intimidation was my game. Obviously, I'm probably not a fun person to play with, if you are a sneaky Mush.</p><p>Early on, my main suspects were Kuan Ti and Janice, well, it was more Janice. Obviously cause they were on my list and Kuan Ti was always vouching for Janice. Though, it was cause he thought that if you were Mush, you lost optimistic and the shrink ability/effects...</p><p>Gioele, the poor sod, was asked to move the freezer cause he had the solid skill. <br>From my perspective: He said something about taking more AP/MP to finish moving it. Terrence and some others jumped on it and killed him. I'm assuming that English was not his primary language. I'd personally have let him continue alive and never ever mention to him that anyone suspects him... cause Serum possibility and he has not entered the dorms after mush phase...</p><p>As for narrowing people down... with the mush doing nothing. Well, people one by one, on their own decided to take the food test to prove their humanity. Jin Su actually outed himself by doing the Mush Dirty skill on Terrence and Hua. As everyone else they were with, alone in the corridors were proven to be human. Hua at that time went to prove she was human and Terrence had done so earlier.<br>Knowing that Jin Su was one of the mush... I went and asked him some very very important questions about the after mush-phase...</p><p>Well, in the end of the Mush phase, there were 3 people who did not do the Mush test... Roland, Jin Su and Chao. The crew had murder in their eyes, Ian even announced that blood was going to be shed. (Janice had done the test around a cycle earlier...)<br>I(Chao) was going to do it, to prove to the others that I was not a Mush... since I was on Eleesha's list along with Roland... but got hit by the stupid lag/flash not loading thing.</p><p>I had gotten dirty cooking the ration and was on my way to the lab to nom it.... I was also carrying my trusty blaster. Anyways, I tried for over an hour, trying to load up the flash portion of the game, but ended up having to leave and go do work. So there was only one thing I could do as a show of faith to prove that I was not Mush... as they hovered around, in anticipation, howling for blood.<br>I dropped the blaster(since that portion of the game UI did not need flash to operate) and told em to kill Roland and stab Jin Su with the Serum.<br>Thankfully, I came back to find that they had trusted me. I took the food test afterwards anyways. Sadly, though, I could not be the one to kill Roland.</p>

                <p>Since we are talking about the mush hunt, this is what I wrote at the time (and it was Hua and me who got dirty not Terrence and Hua):<br><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">D2C3: Hua claimed to have gotten dirty without doing anything. I had seen her earlier standing around in Alpha bay, not under camera protection. A bit curious. I woke up to a "You're filthy" message, which made me even more suspicious of Hua. Good tactic to bring up Slimetrap as a mush skill, use it on someone else, claim you got targeted as well, and thereby cover up getting dirty from producing a spore. The only other person that possibly could have targeted us both was Jin Su. So, one of those two definitely has to be mush.<br><br>Hua did food test, human. So, Jin Su must be mush. But who is the other mush? <br><br>1. Exploration, cycle 5: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/2946," target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/2946,</a> with Jin Su as pilot, to avoid abandoning of the expo. Got O2, 5 alien steaks, and a couple of alien fruits, but also quite a bit of damage to the team and no artifact. Possibly traitor skill involved or just unlucky? Ian and Raluca barely make it with 2 HP left, Jin Su 3 HP, and Kuan Ti 7 HP.<br><br>Stephen is inactive, gets killed since he drools on the bridge and gets all of Paola's extra AP from logistics. Other than that, everything is quiet. Sofa has been build, and we got the Blaster gun. After that Neron projects are being halted until Paola upgrades Neron, so that we get a couple more projects before finishing them in the Nexus. Pilgred is halted at 50% to avoid a Mush rush to Sol.<br>Mycoscan gets researched, everyone is at prefungal level: zero. Super sleeper Mush!<br><br>We need to find the second alpha. Access to Bravo dorm/shower is restricted, everyone stays under cameras at all times with the exception of Raluca, who swears to kill everyone who enters her cubbyhole in one of the rear turrets.<br><br>D3C5: Things become critical. Through voluntary food test and illnesses, all but 4 people are cleared of any suspicion: Jin Su, Janice, Roland, and Chao.<br>Chao has been very helpful, very involved in the mush hunt, although we had a second channel with confirmed humans for planning. Janice kind of suspicious, helpful with Neron projects, but very quiet, and no one knows what she's been doing with her AP since Neron projects were halted. But, leveled up to diplomat. Clever way of making it more difficult to kill her, or just a not so active human? <br><br>Roland kills hunters if they turn up but isn't involved in anything besides that, even though he obviously likes talking, even roleplays a bit. Or he has a slightly annoying sense of humour IRL, who knows. Well, and we already know about Jin Su.<br><br>D3C6/7 So, human crew gets restless, especially Ian, who seems particularly blood thirsty for a peace loving hippy. Finola, Paola, and he decide to rush research of the Natamy rifle. Eleesha is supposed to print the list ... and I don't know what the rest of the plan is. We need to get really lucky to get only confirmed humans on the list, and not Jin Su as the alpha mush. IMO, we should try to lure them out somehow, but I don't understand why we have to rush things anyway.<br><br>List contained Roland and Chao as possible mush. Now Ian wants to kill Chao, because he's less useful than Roland, the pilot. Yeah, that's not how that works. I open up a private chat with Chao and ask him whether he wants to do a food test. He agrees, cooks a ration, gets dirty, goes to front corridor (the "killing team" is assembled in the lab) - and everything lags for him and he's stuck there. So, Chao is dirty in front corridor, everyone panics. OTOH, Roland, our other suspect for mush, stalls on distributing post-its. He's sprinter, so the best man for the job and it costs AP. If he's mush, it would make him less dangerous. He claims he's at work and would do it later. Plausible, but could just as well be that he's talking to his mush partner, planning a rampage, and doesn't want to lose AP.<br>Meanwhile, Chao drops his blaster and goes back to work IRL, still dirty in front corridor. Paola grabs the Natamy rifly, checks whether Chao did indeed drop the blaster, confirms, and goes to kill Roland. Who is indeed the second mush! Phew. <br><br>We rush serum and I inject our Captain with it. A second of doubt passed, then it is confirmed, we are Mush free!<br></span></span></p>

                <p>Couple of words about my fellow crew members: Just incredible.</p><p>Quite a few logged in 6 or 7 out of 8 cycles, and the team work was just brilliant. We got to day 27 with relative ease, because everyone constantly communicated and checked the chat. As I said in my last words, this is how it's done. But the most amazing of all was definitely Jin Su, who for the last couple of weeks or so checked in <em>every</em> cycle, even in the middle of the night, to see whether or not he needed to move the ship. Kudos!</p><p>He and I were also the inhabitants of the front of the ship, with him sleeping on the bridge and me in the medlab, so it was almost natural that we should find together. Our's was not a love ship, the rest of the crew was curiously hesitant to take some private time but I like to think that Jin Su and I somewhat made up for that. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>On the other end of the scale was Chun. I don't know what happend to her, she started out relatively active but suddenly went completely inactive. She hadn't eaten, either, and soon started starving. We managed to keep her alive with 2 heals a day and a few hugs until day 14 cycle 8. <br>Now, it is entirely possible that she had private issues she had to take care off or was affected by the terrible lag like some of our other crew members. That's all understandable and just something that happens. But she did log in a few times after that and shortly became active again - just to do nothing. She got reported as an XP farmer, and I hope she gets a sanction, because there is nothing that explains why you can't just post a sentence about what is going on if you're able to log in. And for all that inactivity she got more glory than Eleesha, who didn't communicate as much as she should have but other than that was an active and helpful member of the crew.</p>

Spending 12+ AP just like that and not finding anything useful feels just terrible. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But that's reminds me. I posted this on the ship already, but maybe others find it interesting as well. We found 116 planets and did 43 expos. I have the expo logs of 38 of them.</p><p>During these 38 expos</p><p>- we wandered through 285 zones</p><p>- of those, 51 were potential artifact zones, 9 Cristalite zones, and 61 potential MIA zones. We never visited a planet with Manakrogs, seismic activity or volcanoes.</p><p>- we found 20 artifacts including 2 starmap pieces in artifact zones, only 1 starmap piece in a Cristalite zone. We actually suspected that Cristalite zones were somehow bugged for us because we got <em>6</em> mush traps and a couple of MIAs before we found our last starmap piece in a Cristalite zone during our 36th expo, on D20C6.</p><p>- we lost a crew member 12 times, all of which were found alive thankfully.</p><p>- we did our very last expo on day 26 cycle 8. I personally think that this is our greatest achievement, to pull off one last expo in the middle of raging fire, falling debris, and constant hunter waves. I might have imagined it, but I think at one point we jumped away from 60 hunters. Insanity!</p><p>- the crew members with the most expos were Janice (29), Hua (25) and Kuan (24), followed by myself (18 ) and Chao (17). Jin Su and Raluca went on 11 expos. Paola (1), Eleesha (2), Finola, Ian (both 6), and Terrence (7) mostly held the ship together while the expos were underway but came to the rescue if it was necessary <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hua here. Glad to read from you all again!</p><p>It was a great ship. We made it to Eden on Day 27 - Cycle 5 in a rush, while we planned to end our journey the next cycle. There were 7 or so fires around, around 8 broken doors and over 20 equipments malfunctioning. Apart from that, however, everything remained fine: we never ran out of resources (lowest fuel was what, 17?), only once got hit by asteroids, had a full Jumpkin garden providing food and O2 and the best crew we could ever hope for.</p><p>Too bad we killed Gioele, I'm also sorry about that: should have suggested we shot him twice with the superfast-researched Natamy Rifle and no more, since we could have misunderstood what he said about his :pm: conversion. Oh, well. In his place, Frieda became our Caffeine Junkie - only without the extra AP. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The best decision we did was to cure Jin Su. He was somewhat silent as the Mush captain, but once he got the serum... wow! Always online, ready to fly wherever and able to find the right coordinates even when waking up in the middle of the night. A born leader, that one! And still everything we decided was based on consensus. I'll miss such a communicative ship.</p><p>I was afraid I'd get killed during the Mush hunt, since I went AFK for a while in Alpha Bay and Jin Su/Roland slimetrapped me. I reported right when the dirty status kicked in (was staying in Alpha Dorm at the time, with no way to have gotten dirty... unless I had extracted a spore), but who would believe me? Frieda got slimetrapped as well, and (since I'm not against it) I think we both did the food test right away. The Mush list narrowed down, and we were sure Jin Su was Alpha. I never knew how you guys found out about Roland, but Paola killed him, we cured Jin Su (would have never made it to Eden without him!) and suddenly the Mush hunt was over. Day 3 it was?</p><p>After that, our glorious journey started to really show. Our two Astrophysicists, Frieda and Kuan Ti, managed to find us enough good planets to keep up two expeditions a day. Around Day 8, we were surprised when we weren't on orbit in cycles 4 and 8. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Still we were a long way from Eden. We favored artifact zones over anything else, had a Diplomat always available and yet only got bottle openers, water sticks, circuit jellies. How frustrating! Our first starmap fragment took a while to show, but when we got it we knew our way to Eden was paved. The second piece took so long to show I think we almost gave up, but after that the third came in somewhat quickly. From a cristlite zone, surprisingly, since all those gave us before were Mush traps. Damn you! Shipwrecks gave us more starmap pieces than cristalite zones. Not even a traitor could have given us such bad luck!</p><p>When we had guaranteed our way to Eden, we decided to end the journey around Day 20. But we were doing so well! It was time to discuss what to do, and most of us wanted to keep going. We saw some MMM ships had already ended (going to Eden even before we had the starmap) and were sure we could make it among the top ships of the season. Some raised their voice towards Day 25, while others were sure we could make it as far as we wanted, aiming towards Day 30.</p><p>Day 25 came, and there was so much to deal with! Fires showed up almost every cycle, things would break without end and hunters appeared by the dozens each time. Like Raluca, I had to put out 6/7 fires at once while fixing crucial stuff around the ship. I joked we could have one technician stationed in each storage (there were four of us) and everyone would have stuff to do every cycle change. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We decided to push a little further, but taking it cycle by cycle. By that time, everyone was online at least 6 cycles a day, so we could count on each among the 11 of us who survived to cure people, put out fires and fix stuff when needed. I don't think around then there was even one cycle in which someone didn't get hurt. Even picking up items was risky, with chances of "that wasn't supposed to happen" sky-rocketing. We had to report our health and morale constantly, and there wasn't a single one of us who wouldn't help controling all the damage going on. I'm so proud about being a part of that crew!</p><p>On Day 26, after our last expedition (how bold is that!?!), we decided to jump to Eden the next day. It was the end of the month, we had been going on for so long and there was nothing left to achieve. Hell, we collected scraps on Day 21, went on to find food on Day 26, had our way to Eden guaranteed... what else was there to look for? Consensus was we'd push the button on cycle 6, since that's when everyone was online. RNG decided to trick us once again, however, and - with O2 and fuel tanks broken, Bridge all up in smoke and patrol ships in all bays not available - there were 6 or 7 fires going on, with most of the crew below 9 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">. It was too risky to keep going, since that same cycle we had Jin Su lose 12 HP to shock + steel plate+ room shake and Bravo Dorm had exploded in fire, with triple metal sheet hits and room shake getting us to around 4/5 HP. It was time to go home. Not a single one of us could lose the glory to reach Eden after so long - either we all live or we all stop right away.</p><p>To anyone curious: there's still one MMM ship flying. They will probably beat every single record. But we had our own victory, and enjoyed every single AP-intensive cycle of it.</p><p>Our reign won't last long, but it sure was fun!</p>

                <p>Kuan Ti here. <br>As I said before, this is my second ship, and a MMM one at that! I hope I was useful to all of you guys, I really did my best <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> All thanks to our great crew and especially our amazing captain !</p><p>Now my personal thoughts about some aspects of the ship:</p><p><strong>Expeditions</strong><br>I found expos the most fun part of this game, so I participated in almost all of them and got a ton of glory.<br>Actually, they were pretty hard and even though we were doing expos twice a day, we couldn't get any Star Map Pieces for over two weeks. We have had 6 mush traps in a row <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> <br>Nevertheless, we never gave up, we fought for each artefact and eventually we managed to gather 2 mappieces on Shipwreck zones. <br>But still RNGesus was brutal with us, we were constantly fighting against all odds to get that final Starmap Fragment. On day 19 after another failure we had a discussion about what to do next, and some of us already lost hope and decided to go home to Sol, and only the determination of majority kept us from that harmful return. I'm proud to say we overcame this obstacle and had a very successful journey.</p><p><strong>NERON Projects</strong><br>Unfortunately, we were very unlucky with project pool, so we had to choose between crucial endgame projects:<br>- Blaster Gun against Magnetic Return<br>- Automatic Sprinklers against General Patching Up<br>- Extra Drone against Trail Minimizer<br>I think this is the main reason why we returned on D27C5, if only we had more luck with projects we would survive a lot longer.</p><p><strong>Researches</strong><br>Everything went very smooth, thanks to our awesome research team! The only project we couldn't finish was Spore Sucker, mostly because it's completely useless.</p><p><strong>Crewmembers</strong></p><p>I was focusing on projects in early game, scanning planets in midgame, and fixing stuff as a Technician until the very end. Also I read Shrink mage book and I was helping Janice boost morale of the crew.</p><p>- Janice - the best partner ever! She was doing her very best to help me with all the projects, and we managed to finish them all without any relay from the rest of the crew, the only exception was Plasma shield (obviously). She was also very helpful as a Diplomat in expos.</p><p>- Raluca - one hell of a woman! She repaired Pilgred, instantly researched Serum with her Genius skill, and finished the Plasma Shield in a cycle. Lately in the game she read Botanist mage book and grafted a lot of jumpkins. Absolutely amazing performance, she also charmed me and became my lover in the end.</p><p>- Jin Su - the most devoted captain I've ever seen, I couldn't even imagine how hard is it to set alarm every cycle just to make sure everything is alright and move the ship when needed. Curing him was definitely a great idea.</p><p>- Ian - we have similar fighting spirits, man! He was a great bronze player, even though he was reluctant to play his character at the beginning. When he disappeared in the middle of the journey I was really worried if we had to kill him to save the trees, but he solved his IRL problems and continued to do his job perfectly.</p><p>- Frieda - annoying 1000 years old granny! We were always fighting over the planet scanning, even though all the crew wanted me to scan to maximize the chances of finding good planets. Nevertheless, she was doing her job really good, and we found 116 planets thanks to her! (I found only 43 of them)</p><p>- Paola - Frieda's best friend! She never listened to me at the beginning when I said to focus on upgrading NERON Core instead of Xyloph DB ( probably because she was suspecting me of being a mush, she said I was №1 suspect in her suspect list ), and as a result we didn't get good projects in the project pool. Otherwise she was perfectly doing her job, and she was helping a lot in the mid to late game killing hunters with Pilot mage book.</p><p>- Chao - the best mush investigator! Even though he was suspected as well, he was really involved in the mush hunt, his ideas were interesting and he didn't kill anyone who was not a mush. In the mid to late game he was busy delivering coffee from Refectory to the Bridge. <br>By the way, Chao, in the two times I've played, I have never gotten to be Mush. So I didn't know if the Optimist icon disappears or not <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>- Terrence - the best hunter killer! Too bad we couldn't play Terrence-trolley because of his lags. He did an excellent job upgrading all the drones, and was killing hunters and collecting scraps afterwards. He also fixed a lot of equipment, which is extremely valuable in the endgame.</p><p>- Finola - perfect nurse! She was very good at healing people when she finished all useful researches. We wouldn't have survived that long without her help.</p><p>- Hua - the most reliable explorer! She was fixing stuff, killing hunters, launching expos, and also she was helping me a lot when everyone was sleeping in Cycle 1-3 with extinguishing fires and fixing broken equipment.</p><p><strong>Defunct crewmembers</strong><br>- Chun - inactive №1. She was pretty active first 4 days, but she simply became inactive after the mush hunt. We hoped that someday she will return to us or at least explain her situation, and we were healing her and boosting her morale everyday, but she was just logging out without saying anything. Reported for XP farming.</p><p>- Stephen - inactive №2. Killed for staying inactive on the Bridge and consuming Paola's logistics.</p><p>- Roland - the mush! I'm really sorry that we had to kill him, he was so good pilot! His roleplay was also pretty interesting.</p><p>- Gioele - the caffeine junkie! Everyone is really sorry that he died by mistake, the journey would have been much easier if he were alive.</p><p>- Eleesha - the detective! It's a shame that she died because of steel plating, but she didn't even report her health status.</p>

                <p>Gioele here. I think I should explain myself.<br>First of all: you asked me to carry Freezer to the I-Bay or at least to the CC, that was me talking about moving it to the B-Bay after counting my APs/MPs. When I got it in the Refectory, I had only 1AP and now MP left, so I had no chance to see that moving with a heavy object in my inventory cost me usual 1MP(my AP was transformed into 2MP on the Refectory-&gt;CC trip). Before that I noticed 'Heavy Object' in my status bar and went to the Wiki, where I found out that moving heavy objects costs you one more MP. At that point my logic told me that Solid skill just makes you able to carry heavy objects, not reducing the cost(and, as I said early, I had no chance to check it without possibly leaving myself exposed in the B-Bay in the case of the fault). So I just picked "Better safe than sorry" option and left it in the CC ending up in the Lab under the protection of the camera. Kinda sarcastic that that was not the safer option.</p><p>P.S.: Terrence and others who decided to kill me. Haven't you realised that I was the last to join the ship, so when I joined, mushes where selected immediately, so I would've be a mush from the very start and just would not have taken that damned 'Paranoid' skill? Ugh...</p><p>P.P.S.: Congratulations, you've done a good job keeping my ship alive.</p>

                <p>Kuan Ti, since you still don't get it. If there's an Astrophysicist with 2 IT points/day on the bridge who doesn't need to pilot and can scan twice a day easily with a couple of coffee and a ration, you don't waste 2 AP to run to the bridge from the dorms to scan, eating coffees, 2 jumpkins and 3 rations min a day to be able to do it, just because you think scanning is more exciting than doing your actual job as a shrink. If I had eaten half the rations you did I could have scanned 3 times a day. And why did you read the shrink book if you didn't plan on actually comforting people?</p><p>I came online each single day at cycle 3 with maxed AP and 2 IT points ready to scan, and you still would try to find a planet cycle 2 or when I announced that I could finish a nice planet the next cycle. You were the one person who ate the most rations on the ship - not a pilot, not a tech, not Paola, <em>you</em>. We constantly had morale problems after Chun died, and still you'd ignore all that and insist on doing my job. It was a waste of AP and rations and I was annoying to you to somehow get this through your head but apparently I wasn't very successful.</p>

                <p>Just a comment from the peanut gallery, but it was Kuan's second ship.</p><p>I know that I didn't understand much about efficiency my second ship, or even how to understand an explanation like what you just gave.</p><p>I don't know how you/you guys tried to explain to him on ship, and of course he's had about 35 days of play total, but failure teaches a lot about what 'doesn't work and mustn't be done'. Both of his ships were human wins, the first a D11 return to sol.</p><p>It might not be possible for him to understand that efficiency stuff until he's struggled through a few ship deaths, where he might just realize, 'wow, if I did this instead of that, then we might be alright now instead of dead really soon'.</p><p>Congrats to you all though, on succeeding despite differences in strategy and understanding!</p>
