                <p>Since I was killed before the ship ended, I have no idea when the ship actually got destroyed, but I imagined it would be sometime around now.</p><p>I was Jin Su and..oh god. It was the first ship that actually made me mad. Raluca, oh you precious, lovely person who was more detrimental to the ship's health than most of the mush I have ever seen before. Without being a mush of course. I was thinking of reporting you, but when I got killed by Chao (I could still read him saying after a discussion: "Oops."<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">, but eh, I guess you had your reasons for being...hostile. Yeah, let's just say that.</p><p>There is no end screen as the ship is either flying or ended but not all people ended it (since most people were AFK). So the biggest quistion would be, who was the second mush? I'm genuinly curios to see if it was another AFK person, or someone really undercover as we saw no sabotages to the ship.<br>Apart from that, I don't think we had much of a chance, Sol would have been the only answer, the low activity would have only meant that we could get 1-2 expo then Sol before everything falls around us.</p><p>Still it was fun, if for the human side of the things, a new experience where almost everyone was inherently hostile to everyone. Yay. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Here's hoping someone reads it from that ship. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I was Janice, and you and absolutely everyone else were simply incredible. When Raluca accused you, I felt certain she was right... and that Ian was Mush, too. I thought that all the way up until the end. The assassinations, the mystery, the slow-creeping despair as the end came closer and everyone was holding on by the skin of their teeth... Incredible. Roland was using Anonymush, laying low and converting people. Very clever. By the time we got all the mush, the crew was half gone from assassinations alone.</p>

                <p>Hi guys, Eleesha here. We actually managed to hold on for another few days. After Chao killed you we dogpiled him and JUST about took him out, but I took a serious injury in the process. We needed to heal up... and then Roland popped up and murdered Chun in plain sight. We thought we were done (I had smashed arms, Janice had weapon phobia) and that Ian was mush too... but it turned out that he'd just gone AFK without his tracker at the worst possible time - whilst holding weapons!</p><p>So we dogpiled Roland instead, and actually survived for another couple of days after that, but there were just too many hunters and trax and only six living crew... I made a number of mistakes that I wouldn't if I'd known a little bit more about the game but it was overall a fantastic game. ...Chao was terrifying, and that despairing moment when Roland killed Chun... followed by the hope when we actually turned it over.</p>

We decided to kill him to prevent other "random" kills, but when we had got him, things popped up in more clear fragrance. He was <em>MUSH</em>!!! But, wait... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"> He had gastro desease before... How did he get it? He wasn't Alpha! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/idea.png" alt=":idea:" class="tid_ico"> He had caught the desease before he was infected! But in ship's status bar we could see 2 mush's corpse... What did it mean? Right! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/surprised.png" alt="8D" class="tid_ico"> <em>Active alpha</em> had been hiding under <em>Anonymush</em> skill since he had converted Chao! Chao was great target, as all the time he was in rooms alone separated from others! So <em>MUSH</em> still alive??? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/omg.png" alt=":omg:" class="tid_ico"> I really suspected Gioele and that was my mistake... We could catch Roland before Chun's death.</p><p>I pretty sure, that Chao&amp;Roland's plan was to inject wrong amount of fuel into the chamber to lose planet with O2... Chao said in main thread that <em>Roland already had injected fuel</em>(!!!) But there was only <em>one</em> unit, as noticed Kuan Ti. We should turn our attention to this fact, but we didn't do this... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So <em>Mushie</em> had 2 mistakes: Chao's gastro and impatient. Roland really had a chance to hold on longer, if he would didn't kill Chun! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cross.png" alt=":X:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway after massacre we stayed in team of six crews: Gioele, Eleesha, Hua, Kuan Ti, Janice and Me. And really every neron's project and researc that we did before helped us a lot!!! Magnetic net, lenses, additional pots! We managed to get self-sufficiency about O2! We DID go to expo at least. That wasn't so productive, but funny! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Hope, Kuan Ti saved my diary from there. I forgot to copy it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Grats to Eleesha and Hua! Despite of the fact that their were novices they helped a lot to the team! Eleesha was quite good as Comm Officer<img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"> and Hua learned to fight hunters' waves with very intensive efficiency.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>May be the main fault was Raluca's rage that dropped us down very hard. Don't know, but, <em>Raluca</em>, Jah forgives you! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Awesome jorney! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p>

I am guilty of playing with the MAD Kube - but can you blame me? Luckily, Ian did pull us through in the end by getting back on at the right time.</p><p>My major kudos goes to Ian, though - he really helped us a lot with his analysis of the situation no matter how crazy it got. Also, the expodition that we did go to was a blast with his journals. Here they are:</p><p><cite> <em><strong>Ian's diary. Mystical exploration. Day 1</strong></em> Kuan Ti landed our ship succesfully. I don't give a (bleep) how this mad-computer-geek, that lost his eyeglasses managed to do it, while Gioele was snoring in the rear part of Icarus. All the time of our flight I was trembling from fear of waiting our possible death, that can occur on the planet. Thanks to Eleesha, love of all my life, that after many years we was separated one from another after Tau Ceti, she at least was with me in Icarus.<br> <br><em><strong>Ian's diary. Mystical exploration. Day 2</strong></em> We have found oxygen, but very little amount( 8 units). "Pray Jah, that I have my banana babies," - I said to Gioele. He answered that Janice was vomiting because of banana diet last night and we should find another food on this planet. Kuan Ti agreed with Gioele, that banana's salad, banana's soup and banana's bread don't combine so much with black coffee...<br> <br><em><strong>Ian's diary. Mystical exploration. Day 3</strong></em> At the morning suddenly we found out that Gioele woke up earlier and went somewhere. He was standing behind a rock with Alien TV in one hand and alien's heart in another. He tell us that this alien asked some clean water, but Gioele wanted to save it for one more cup of coffee for later, so he decided to find compromiss with peacefull "gypsy" by alternative way... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"><br> <br><em><strong>Ian's diary. Mystical exploration. Day 4</strong></em> Here is really hot... hot... very very hot... All the day we was wandering in desert without a tip of cold water. Strange that Gioele still feel good. All the night that maniac was watching new TV and now he tells us 5862 parts of new alien serial named "Aliesus' passions"... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> Anyway in this weather Eleesha got wet soaked and dropped her combinezone. Guess, you understand, what I mean... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br> <br><em><strong>Ian's diary. Mystical exploration. Day 5</strong></em> We met alience again... They wanted to take back their TV and Gioele even started to cry:"WHY CHAO LEFT US???"... at once Eleesha explained them, why we need this TV and aliens were so excited by her arguments(hope you get, what i mean <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> ), that they gifted her with Invertebrate Shell. They said something like:" ハァァガレメェフ" ... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"><br> <br><em><strong>Ian's diary. Mystical exploration. Day 6</strong></em> I'm full of this noodles and bananas. Enough... I wannt some meat,meat,meAT, MEAT!!! sadist Since we had eaten last steak made from corpse of unlucky-lucky Roland passed two weeks.... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> Ouuuh! Tasty moth! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> It's edible... But these moths really looks like elephants! Anyway... Great taste! cute<br> <br><em><strong>Ian's diary. Mystical exploration. Day 7</strong></em> And what do you think? Whole the family of this poor moth, that I had eaten yesterday, arrived to us... They wanted revenge for their "little Smurly". We escaped from them into one of these deep caverns and took a break there. Occasionally, Kuan Ti, that can't see quite good without his eyeglasses ran into a wall and broke it... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> That's story how we found some oil... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br> <br><em><strong>Ian's diary. Mystical exploration. Day 8</strong></em> Time to come back to Icarus. Fortunately, we had ropes to leave caves via holes in ceiling. At the last moment we saw a scorpion that catch Eleesha's rope from below, but she didn't look surprised so much... She said, that she'll tie a new one from her beautiful hairs... omg<br> <br> <em><strong>Ian's diary. Mystical exploration. Day 9</strong></em> Again this stupid desert... What do we need all this oil, that we found, for??? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"> During this night Kuan Ti just for joke smeared us with this oil... sq_out Jocker, bliad... . As morning came and sun arised Me, Gioele and Eleesha ignited from high temperatures.... Thanks to Gioele's stock of coffee... He put down it immediately... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> P.S. That's all. We lucky returned to Daedalus. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br> <br><em><strong> Ian's diary. Mystical exploration. Epilogue </strong></em>Forgot to tell the main part from this adventure.... When we almost got to Icarus a mad rabbit jumped out of bushes and bit Gioele for his ass...

                <p>Hi, Roland here!</p><p>It was pretty hard the Mush job here. Finola and I were alpha mushes, but Finola went AFK without doing a single Mushy thing (the only thing she did was working on antispore gas lol). We had a paranoid Gioele (which means 5 cameras), and the antispore gas was finished before I ever knew I was a Mush. So it was hard to find targets.</p><p>Anyway, I managed to convert Chao by myself (I had to spike him 3 times, I took out medlab's camera for the last one, but nobody suspected me), and picked Anonymush just after it.</p><p>My plan was to convert someone more (Ian was the next on the list), but I had some problems. The first one, Chao hurried and killed Jin (yes, he wanted to move the ship so we cannot find oxygen, but the timing was not good. So I was alone again, thoug job). The second problem was I wasn't able to get online for a entire day, so probably when I got back, the ship would probably already been destroyed. So the only thing I could do was doing the highest damage posible, and that was killing Chun (and probably could have killeed someone else if Ian hadn't took the knife).</p><p>Finally, Ian, you had an spore (taken from the cat, which was a Mush agent), and I could have spiked you when I went killing Chun. So, if I could have been online the next day, you'll have been converted, but I had some personal issues so only one posible thing for me to do.</p><p>Anyway, I really enjoyed this ship, and it may have gone far if I wasn't Mush. Hope to see you in some other ship!!</p>

                <p>Chao here. Mwahahahaha! What a great ending to my killing spree. So many eggs cracked to make that omelette, and then Roland turned me into a mush right after I kill Finola!
