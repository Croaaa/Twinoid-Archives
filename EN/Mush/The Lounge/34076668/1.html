                <p>Greetings, comrades of the Daedalus! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> Kuan Ti here to provide you with an awful summary, as promised! Our ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1396" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1396</a></p><p>Ours was a mostly active ship. Chun jumped right in to take charge of the research team and Mush hunt right off the bat, and Finola managed to get quite a few Research projects out the door. Janice and I managed Nexus projects, Raluca stayed in the back turret, but closely monitored the PILGRED, and Ian had a bit too much fun with his bananas. Paola was a Rebel/Xyloph pro, Stephen proved very helpful in the beginning, and Gioele served as a second shrink at the start of the ship. Our Frieda did a great job scanning planets for us, we only lived long enough to visit one. Between that one planet and Ian's mad gardening, though, we had plenty of O2 the whole game. Terrence .... you know, in retrospect, I have no idea why no one suspected Terrence. He had Robotics Expert, but never once talked about his drones. Gioele was active up until just before he was turned to Mush, apparently, and worked with Chao and Chun on the Mush hunt. Hua and Roland kept us out of hunters, and I get the feeling the Eleesha did not have much experience with the Mush hunt. If I'm recalling correctly, our Jin Su was the only inactive, at the start. Last, but not least, the <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico"> lived in Bravo Dorm along with our pink lemonade shower (which I, sadly, only got to enjoy once).</p><p>Poor Stephen was played well, no waste of food in the beginning, helpful throughout the ship ... but was the first human brutally murdered for delivering food when we started starving. Our clever Mush, you see, turned their first victim right around the same time as a ration was eaten, and he had the misfortune of being dirty from cooking, so it was decided that he was too suspicious to live. He marked our first death, killed by Chao under orders of Gioele, Terrance, and Chun. This started a rash of human slaughter, as we all turned against one another.</p><p>Though next was Jin Su, who starved to death. RIP. Your death was out of our hands.</p><p>After that, Janice took a gamble and killed Eleesha, convinced she was Mush. Then Chao killed Roland for odd behavior. Gioele, in turn, killed Chao for having killed two humans. Panic rippled the ship at that point, as it seemed rash decisions were being made at every turn with little to no evidence or discussion, and all of those killed were fellow humans. Chun, in response, set up an elaborate testing system to try and pinpoint Mush by hyper-monitoring point usage and activity.</p><p>During our testing period, a fourth Mush was born. There was a period of uncertain activity, then Chun died of depression. Hua was murdered for claiming to have given up on the ship early on, in spite of her excellent pilot skills. Then Frieda was murdered, Terrence mutated, and we hit the last legs of our journey.</p><p>The humans tried to take a last stand, but with MushIan, we were unable to take any of the Mush out. Janice went on a rampage after them, but ended up dying of depression. Raluca was offed next, and then only Paola and I remained. The Mush were trying to convince us to move the ship to avoid hunters, but we instead chose to sacrifice our ship and take a few pot shots at the Mush before giving in to the inevitable in our comfy, Alpha Dorm beds. I'm pretty sure Terrence died from injuries given to him by Paola in the end, there, too.</p><br><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> All in all, an awesome ship, and, as I stated on board, my first RP ship, so you'll all have a place in my heart forever. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"> I have some scraps of our conversations at the end (which was, by far, the most fun leg of the voyage), which I'll put up a bit later on. Now it is time to give my fingers a rest and maybe get some coffee, though.</p>

                <p>Hi Kuam Ti! Hi all others!</p><p>Paola here! I really enjoyed the last hours of the ship. But I have to admit I did not like the ship in the first cycles… There was no hope for humanity, Chun turned out to be a nurse instead. Also Jin Su was inactive… Only thing that made me not to give up the ship that early was the fact, that there was nearly no post out of character. I liked the feeling of the ship and continued as well as I can.</p><p>I did comms-managers duties and burned every single AP of the first days into bases, xyloph and NERON. I got every single Xyloph DB entry, Chuns Ghost was one of the last 2 entries and was unlocked about 5 minutes after her death…<br>The rebel bases came every day at C1, that was a hard job for me, since I am regularly sleeping through that time, so I decoded the rebels signals most by C3. That went well for every base except the one that gives the blaster bonus. This one I missed, because the ship was moved to a planet about an hour before I got up in RL.<br>So I cared for NERON with APs that were not used or needed for rebel bases after finishing Xyloph and rebel bases. So I managed to upgrade him to Version 3.</p><p>To do that I burned really every AP, since I did not knew when I would be able to connect again. In the late evening I came back online and discovered that there are 4 mushes and 3 humans left. Also there were a wall of text, long as the great wall in PRC…</p><p>I read the WOT and was excited about the RP that was there between the mushes and Janice, I tried to save Janice somehow and ran to the medlab, kicked “wheely” (as I called Terrence from the first day on) right in the face. Since he was with Ian it burned my AP completely to hit im once. The MP that was left were used to get away from them and go to A-Dorm. Filthy as I was, I felt into the bed right beneath Kuan Ti.</p><p>I convinced him to give me the blaster, because I wanted to redeem Gioele, my Father, from mushiness. But it was a trick. With the blaster and the last bullet I ran to the garden, to where Terrence and Ian moved in the meantime, shot and kicked for Terrence each one time, both measures were a success, at least one a critical success as it turned out a cycle later when Terrence died by his wounds. But I when that happened I already was in bed. It was a simple escape I tried. I just ran away. I planned to reach B-Dorm but somehow miscounted MP and got lost in the ship, ending up without AP/MP in CentreBravoTurret. In RP I sent Kuan Ti a last message about a faint, and an huge OOC post in which I thanked everyone for the great last hours. Kuan Ti in turn spend me a mission, so I could get back to the dorm. I dropped the blaster for him, hoping he could do anything with it eventually and went to bed, IG as RL…</p><p>I woke up in the morning and was surprised, that the ship made it through another 2 cycles then. Even more I was surprised that Terrence was hurt so much, that he bled out <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Thank you all everyone! A realy great ship! I really enjoyed it, despite the doubts I had at the beginning.</p><p><strong><em>NobbZ</em></strong></p>

If there is a confirmed death but no deathmessage then you will see only the braces: «». You can see an example when looking at Eleeshas message.</p><p>If the braces are missing, then you can tell, that the player hasn't confirmed his death so far.</p><p>But you are right. All three shone by their inactivity for their last cycles…</p><p>For Gioele I think he logged in and saw that he is mush and lost interest and left game.<br>Hua propably left the game completely after we tried to push her to do more for the ship than simply idling in the corridors and patral ships…<br>And for Jin Su, I can't even tell if he was in tutorial or had a tutorial free game…</p>

                <p>Hua was sami-active from the beginning I guess. Later on when she's read about "Ian's Banana" thingy, I guess she's lost interest till the end of the game. I think some people just can't take jokes like that <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/oups.gif" alt=":anim_oups:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Jin Su died on 3rd day cause of hunger or something like that, so... yea. He was inactive from the very beginning.</p><p>Gioele... If only we had him active... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"><br>Edit: Thanks to Gioele and Chao we had this chain of deaths after all... ;-;</p>
