Lucky for me was that i was just active at cycle change and noticed me getting more and more hurt. So I quickly did flee, and escaped with a patrol craft into safety. Btw I also got hurt by taking off and had only 3 hp left then ^^.</p><p>Well, Chao did still more damage since he pulled 5 spores and phagocyted them.<br>He killed Stephen, Raluca and tried to kill Janice. At least I was able to tell her where the knife is hidden and she was active to hurt Chao pretty much and kill him actually in the end because of an injury. But she was killed by Roland, the other mush., who did take off after hurting also Chun a bit.</p><p>well I left him behind and that was it.</p><br><p>Every other crew member was inactive and braindead. they didn't finish tutorial and died of starvation or morale loss.<br>But we 3 mushketeers did shine! <br>Eleesha, Kuan Ti and myself, everyone of us did work hard together a pilgred (while I focused more on giving them morale and moving ship away/killing hunters) and... we made it!</p><p>I am very proud of you two, you will develop into great players, you are already great players!!</p>

                <p>Hey team! Chao checking in.</p><p>Mmm. This was my first time playing Chao. I've got a few other characters I have not yet played.</p><p>Sperbi knew I was on the ship. He asked to follow me to it. He knew I was there and very likely knew who I was, and I felt a bit cornered from the moment I realized I was mush - even before he confirmed he was on the ship.</p><p>The ship had a fairly high number of not-finished the tutorial folks, 6 of them.</p><p>This was my assessment of people at the start and during my rampage:</p><p><strong>Jin</strong> was gold, 4 skills, active, sharp, fully able to be a leader.<br>Chao, gold, 4 skills, me and mush.<br><strong>Stephen</strong>... a bit quiet. Gold and 4 skills Got threatened by Finola pre mush selection, for having solidly pushed her out of medlab - she was taking the medlab bed and people had injuries. I stepped in to stop that.... he died the cycle after mush selection, so never got to know him well, but I bet he was a strong player who just never got to show it..<br><strong>Janice</strong> bronze shrink. Aware of morale duty. Gave me a comfort pre mush selection, very very appreciated because we didn't have Chun at first day change, and hey, rampages are a thing, could happen. Did dorms duty - and probably had a real role in why humans won the ship for both her dorm duty <em>and</em> her actions (and luck!) during my rampage.<br><strong>Finola</strong>... a touch quiet early game. I was unsure her skills, gold status, and skill as a player before the rampage. During it I got to see she was active and smart.<br><strong>Kuan</strong> bronze designer, aware of projects, tentatively considered him a newbie, was definately active. Spoke very little, a willing follower.<br><strong>Raluca</strong> bronze Physicist, aware of pilgred, got pilgred to 11% pre mush selection. I requested she stop pre mush selection, warned of pilgred rushes. Definately at least occasionally active.</p><p>So.... 7 actives. Course, I only named one of the real stars of the show. More to be revealed...</p><p>These three I classified as Wild Cards, I had no idea if they were likely to be good or bad players, actives or inactives:</p><p><strong>Gioele</strong> Pre mush selection, moved himself to refectory, and that was it. I got there D1C8 - he was there, but no coffee poured, still two alien fruit in the refectory. Mmmm... One was a jumpkin. I ate the other, took the coffee, and planted that Jumpkin <em>immediately</em>. Had to, cause.... day change. Food destruction coming. It was SO PAINFUL to not be able to carry that jumpkin at all times. Pre mush selection, can't..... But Jumpkin.... I settled on holding it through cycle changes, then dropping it right after. Spirit of the rules upheld! As was the baby plant, as high as Chao-arms can reach upwards. Oh yeah, I'm talking about <strong>Gioele</strong>.... So no idea if he was going to be active again or not. Bronze solid.<br><strong>Eleesha</strong> Went from joining the ship apparently directly to a bed in bravo dorm. Had not moved since then. mmmmmmmmmmm. That can be any sort of player. Bronze tracker.<br><strong>Roland</strong> Just like Eleesha.... oh yeah. Except, he was my alpha partner. No idea about him, he'd been in bed a while, was probably overflow on AP. Silver pilot shooter, as I recall. Also in bravo dorm.</p><p>The remaining cast of 6 people were mostly inactive to totally inactive, at least to start. Ian had left the lab and entered and left the refectory, made it back to FC before he just... stopped. Alright, that's tactically important. All the other 5, everyone not named, was talkie-less in lab, never moved, so a time bomb of 5 morale points waiting to go off in about 16 cycles.</p><p>Oh, and honorable mention to the RNG, of course. RNG was definitely involved in this ship.</p><p>Jin and Finola rushed Constipaspore, got it to upper 80s I think. I thought and thought and thought about how I wanted to play this ship, what the strengths and weaknesses of the humans were....</p><p>But I'm out of time. What I did and why, later, for those interested.</p>

                <p>Very much influence had time of mush selection, it was not long before I was waking up and checking the game/finding sample and tech book. If mush selection would have been just some hours earlier, I would just have been sleeping and everything could have been different then I fear. Maybe better, maybe worse, but definitely different.</p>

I may be bronze but I have been on a hand full of ships just have not wanted to go gold yet but players like you guys make me want to. (setting on 1117 xp lol).</p><p><strong>Jin Su and Eleesha </strong> you two are the awesome really hope you see you again</p><p><strong>Chao</strong> going on a rampage may not be the most fun or intriguing way to be a mush but it is a legitimate option especially on a ship where a lot of the crew are inactive no need to play the long game I would have probably done the same thing myself.</p><p>Over all this ship was one of my worst in terms glory but one of the most fun I have ever been on and I hope to see you all on board the Daedalus again.</p><p>P.S.

                <p>Typo, yep, here's my rather delayed 'rest of the story', where my reasons for not transferring out are covered.</p><p>So.</p><p>I'd refreshed a bit after mush selection, found I'd been picked. Again.... recently I average 1 of 3 games as alpha mush. That was my 4th time in 7 ships as alpha mush.</p><p>I looked at everything, thought about how I wanted to play this.... considered the number of inactives, the known skills of the visible actives, my skills.... and the fact that I felt 'identified' by Sperbi. I figured I knew who he was, Jin.... but I figured he'd expect a certain range and type of play of me, presuming I was human. Sometimes I've played with that before, but I decided this time, no. I didn't want to. Not as Chao with his unique strengths and weaknesses. This time, this ship, I thought I had the best chance for my team to win, and would have the most fun, by acting immediately.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8073024 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8073024">Tpyo</span></span><cite>Interestingly enough a while back I had a game with Spazticus where he did the same thing - so clearly mush rushing is condoned by the SDF.</cite><p>But of course.... <em>any</em> legal strategy is... well. Legal. Your intention is strongly what matters, and my intention was to win that ship for my team. That's 100% legal.</p><p>Rushing is by far not the only strategy I recommend or use as a mush... Various other AP threads discuss this, from my point of view as mush at the time. I too have been a human chiding mush who rushed as 'should do better next time'.... When I do this it's by showing them as clearly as I can that I have defeated their plan and lost nothing important from it. However this choice of mine was tailored to the ship. It could have beaten this ship, though some luck got involved. No plan is foolproof. A player is not wrong to try and use a strategy that only <em>might</em> win. As long as you are trying and following the other rules, heck yeah I condone you.</p><br><br><p>I did not have crazy eyes, hadn't leveled Chao enough for that yet (Did mention it was my first time playing him, mmm?) No antimush research finished yet, but Constipa really close.... alright. Think....</p><p>So I'm going to rampage as Chao. I can go hide behind a 'did not finish tutorial' Ian, who is alone in FC. As Chao I can easily have plenty of moves to leave and return to him if and as needed. It's important to stop anti-mush research; no comms officer so I probably should grab the mush sample, right next to Ian, great. But only if the survivors are likely to think of rushing antimush on me.... if they can be kept too busy to do more anti-mush, I can ignore that sample. Will see. I have 11 AP right now, 8 moves. We have a Stephen with apprentice, who has been active, we have a Raluca physicist who has already started Pilgred (it's at 11%, I've warned already not to continue it early for fear of mush pilgred rush). No techs. No functional comms officer seem likely. A rare ship without comms, cool, since I'm mush.</p><p>I don't know what the starting skill book is, but it's probably not important. Do I wait another cycle for max AP? That might be a good idea, but with constipaspore at 90%.... nah. I'm done waiting. My partner hasn't answered me yet; he was last visibly active D1C8, when he joined the ship... he apparently took down hunters and went to bed, never said anything then, hasn't yet (my rampage began D2C4, mush selection was C3)</p><p>He could be anything, anyone.... but my window of greatest rampage power is linked in part to constipaspore.</p><p>How to help myself the most? Alright. Skills: Fertile. Mycellium. Phagocyte. Hard boiled. Oh cool, medkit's in my room too.</p><p>Plan: Kill Jin (only detected strong human leader, and gold - and said he hid knife somewhere), conveniently he is beside me in alpha dorm right now. Kill stephen (gold, potentially dangerous skills, apprentice is perilous too), conveniently <em>also</em> beside me in alpha dorm. Kill Raluca (control pilgred progress), currently in engine room, 3 moves away. Kill Janice (morale control, sharper, tighter time limit), in bravo dorm. Move to Ian, rest, re-evaluate, make further plans.</p><p>So I snagged my skills and started to pound on Jin. RNG was with him, as was a nice set of fast reflexes and a well trained urge to frequently refresh the page: I had a hit, miss, hit, miss, hit .... and a fleeing Jin, who ran to Alpha bay and launched, and screamed about the mush attack.</p><p>To his credit, he didn't suspect I was a griefer <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Mush attack all the way.</p><p>Mmmmmmmm.</p><p>Well, Jin is alive, that's disappointing, well done Jin. However, he's badly hurt, I punch for minimum of 3 damage, so he's down to at highest 7 health left and possibly all the way down to 1 health. He was low AP from helping rush constipaspore; he wants that finished but didn't reset it again, Finola was the last to report progress (84%) Tempting to help finish.... Jin didn't reset, so he is low/no AP, but had a cycle change in bed.... Kk, he probably cannot land for at least 2 cycles. He ain't dead..... but temporarily out of action for sure.</p><p>On to Stephen. Miss, hit, hit, miss, hit.... and AP getting low.... time to spore and Phagocyte. 3 spores popped, all 3 eaten; net gain of 8 AP, 2 spores left for today. Hit... Stephen is STILL alive, holy eep. Hit, and dead Stephen. Heh, thanks RNG, 7 attacks to kill one player, 5 attacks on another who isn't even dead.... Damp sadness.</p><p>On to Raluca! Enter through rear alpha storage, drat no blaster.</p><p>Miss, hit, miss.... Come ON, RNG.... Spore, sacrifice to the RNG.... hit, phagocyte cause I must.... Hit, miss.... RNG! What are you doing to me! Spore, phagocyte.... plan is looking borked indeed.... hit, and Raluca dead.</p><p>.... Kk. 7 <em>MORE</em> hits to kill one more human. I swear when I am human killing mush suspects I have way better luck than this. Fie! Fine. Probably I should forget Janice for now and just go straight to Ian.</p><p>I head through rear bravo storage.... and find a blaster. Oh. Oho! 4 shooter points, so. Yeah. Lets still try for Janice. Oh yeah, and this precious baby jumpkin, heh heh heh. Hidden there, right in rear bravo storage. Now I can carry the blaster (and itrackie and medkit).</p><p>Dorm! Janice! Ooh, no camera. That was nice to know.... wish I'd known that sooner. Pow pow pow. !!! Miss. Miss.... Hit. And a special message. She lost her balance and fell over. Injury? Could be. I can hope. I have like 2 moves left, and 2 AP. I want to make sure I can run to Ian if I face attack (so far I face only messages from a frantic Jin). I spend 1 AP to try and punch Janice.... and hit. Yay.</p><p>So now it's a waiting game. Much depends on who logs in next.... and what they think. I had already told my partner something like:</p><p><cite>A pretty skilled player knows I am on the ship. Probably already suspects that I am mush. I have decided to early rampage, I will be using all 5 spores (I have taken mycelium spirit) for today. I'll be doing my absolute best to cripple the ship, players-wise.</cite></p><p>Now I tell him approximately this:</p><p><cite>If you also decide to rampage early: Please focus on active, easy to kill targets. Jin is currently off ship and probably won't land again (he launched from alpha bay) until he believes someone can rapidly heal him. He is currently almost dead though. Janice is also almost dead. Kuan is known to be active. Finola is known to be active. Ian is in FC and is a great person to hide beside. Jin is gold, and knows where the knife is hidden, getting him dead means the knife can't be used against us.</cite></p><p>Well. I sure don't want this wait to be boring..... and people can get confused. So it's time to counter Jin's claims. Well, if Jin is a mush.... why would I attack Janice? Ahh. So I post a counter claim, something like:</p><p><cite><em><strong>Team</strong> Janice is mush</em>. She is currently in <strong>bravo dorm</strong>. There is no camera here, so watch her close for transfer, if she loses skills don't finish the kill, she jumped into someone else. <em>Jin is mush</em> He is in space off of alpha bay, we will have to get <strong>magnetic net</strong> project to force him to land by hacking the ship, or just hack the ship and move to kill him. Jin killed Stephen and Raluca. Following Jin's trail, I saw that Janice must be a newbie. She spored in the engine room with Raluca there, probably spiked Raluca.</cite></p><p>Sure, anyone checking roomlogs is going to see proof to the contrary... I was the one who spored in alpha dorm and engine room, and killed those folks. But not everyone checks those logs.... some people just read messages and start to kill. It <em>could</em> work, good enough for me. Jin and I yell back and forth counter claims. Finola connects, talks, she uses the little moves and AP she has left (she had participated in the research rush that almost finished constipaspore) to check logs. She takes a bed in alpha dorm after.... great. She's incapacitated for a bit, not enough AP and moves probably to do anything else.</p><p>Refresh, refresh, refresh, talk with them both, refresh, refresh...</p><p>Partner connects! Tells me I'm probably going to be dead before day change, and that he's going to lie low, then tomorrow probably take mycellium spirit and phagocyte and rampage as well. I ask him, if he's going to do that, to take MS <em>now</em> and give me today's 6th spore if he's planning to not use it either. I suggest that he possibly as well or alternately helps kill Janice now, then explain why Kuan should be the next target, because he should have AP (unlike Jin and Finola), is reachable right beside us in the dorm (totally unlike Jin off ship) and is known to be active (unlike almost everyone else on the ship).</p><p>Partner doesn't answer. An hour of refreshing and rarely talking happens.</p>

                <p>Refresh, refresh, refresh, gotta go to the bathroom. Refresh, refresh.... Okay, going.</p><p>Get back. I've been stabbed 4 times. Janice left the room, came back and attacks me: Miss, hit, hit, hit, hit. Heh. If I could have only had that kind of aiming luck <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Last stab was a minute before, the first 2 minutes before, so attack is over. I have 6 health left, and an injury that I understand does nothing, is bugged: 3rd degree burns over 90% of my body. Now, I'm already dirty, and it's supposed to kill you if you get dirty, through infection.... but it's bugged, and I'm mush - I don't get infections.</p><p>I even tell the humans I have it, haha. I can still run to Ian, but I do want to shoot Janice first with the new blaster charge and 4th shooter shot after cycle change (was why I hadn't run to Ian yet) and I wanted to punch her twice (I'd have the moves to reach Ian without converting AP) to help ensure she died before I ran to Ian. 6 health is far from ideal, but it's still going to cost like heck to finish killing me by Ian.</p><p>My partner reconnects, minutes to cycle change. Decides to stand up and finish killing Janice -then-.</p><p>SHEESH.</p><p>If he had done that earlier, before she logged in, got the knife, and stabbed me!</p><p>But now he is made as a mush too, or will be, once the roomlogs are read.</p><p>He appears to be not thinking much, maybe already panicking? He doesn't even grab the knife that dead Janice dropped, until I remind him to.</p><p>I try to strategize with him. I expect to be alive after cycle change. Cycle change comes.</p><p>Me, a mush, is dead from sepsis, a disease.</p><p>My partner apparently panics further. He <em>could</em> use mycellium spirit and phagocyte himself a spore, but he doesn't (only 5 spores made all ship.... I made all 5). He doesn't follow any of my suggestions, doesn't even run to hide by Ian so he is a scary live mush threatening Jin just by being alive (Jin is nearly dead, remember), and a threat to everyone, who has to spend 3 AP to attack him at all.</p><p>No. My partner ends up launching into space without apparently attacking anyone active. So Jin, smart, experienced, dangerous player, knows exactly where the last mush is. He lands, runs to eat, coordinates fuel loading, and moves the ship. Cheap, fast kill of the second mush. Sadly, I suspect that very fast and inexpensive kill of mush 2 helped humans far more than it did the mush.... but my plan didn't let me gain much of my partner's trust, oh well. I totally failed to anticipate what my disease meant.</p><p>Had I known, I would have <em>had</em> to have my partner heal me once at least with medkit, and showered for 2 AP (I had it, all I had) before cycle change. That would have saved me for longer, but I didn't know. I could have survived a shower even without a heal, but with probably just 2-3 health left. Now I know about 90% third degree burns, and being mush.</p><br><br><p>So I say to you, Finola and Jin, who belittled what you understood of my strategy and choices in the chats of that ship - fie. My plan <em>could</em> have won the ship for mush. I believe you guys had a struggle to win, even with how it all actually played out. Since when has that been <em>boring</em>? Luck was a HUGE part of this ship for both sides.</p><p>Do not put other players down. Defeat them, yes. Show them their plan was bad, if it is. Don't just call it boring. Every plan, mush or human, can be countered. You guys successfully countered my plan, well done. I failed to counter your plans, well done. But that does not mean I played wrong, and sure as shooting I am not on your ship as a mush to entertain you, humans. I'm there to win, just like you. If I bore you in the process.... keep it to yourself, 'say' it by defeating me faster and with obvious, even contemptuous <em>ease</em>, not with rude words. I have the right to play for my own pleasure, to make my own choices, unless and until I break the rules.</p><p>By the way - all of you - you all have that right too. Your play belongs to you, and I will defend you playing the way you want to play - as long as you are not breaking any rules. I like to think that's one of the reasons why I am a mod.</p><p><em>Oooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmm</em></p>

                <p>Some observations :</p><ul><li>When blitz attacking a crewmember, you can decrease the chances of them escaping by pushing the attack command in rapid succession multiple times without letting the game refresh. This has the downside of preventing you from stopping should anything catastrophic happens in the process (weapons critical failure, for example. But in this instance, it doesn't effect you)</li><li>When abusing pacifism or crazy eyes, it is key to locate and prevent the opposing team from using the weapons on you. Either pick them up, hide or dismantle. Characters with kick out ability should also be your primary target if you plan on going all out with this method<br>At least you went after Jin Su and the knife first thing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></li></ul>

And with the morale bombs in lab, that connection wasn't even established.</p><p>In such a case I would be tempted too to do a rampage. Reason why I often don't do it is...that I am just very very rarely a mush, at least it feels like that to me ^^. So I want to enjoy the time being mush every single minute. When I am able to enjoy it... <br>I still remember a ship of mine long time ago where I was on a MMM ship. I took the most easy way to win with pilgred rush. Because we both felt very pressured, we thought someone is suspecting us already and...we have that chance to win, why ignorig it? Wouldn't that be even playing against our team a bit to deny such a great chance when we have the feeling they would get us rather sooner than later? Well, who can stop a physician/tech Raluca with a Jin as partner...They couldn't.</p><p>And our game was really not boring, so I should rather be grateful <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/oups.gif" alt=":anim_oups:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>___</p><p>But on this ship here, RNG was fully on our side. I was able to find interesting stuff after mush selection (the knife and the tech magebook, which I did hide both) and that I did survive your first attack (I was indeed your best first target) was a big help for human team.</p><p>At first it didn't seem like it though. I saw many inactive people. Finola told actually also in research thread she would be away for longer time. That she was awake after a while to confirm you being mush was totally unexpected (but she had because of research also almost no aps).<br>But besides from that noone was awake. And I wondered whether there would come even anyone online soon and able to do something and would even be able to understand the situation fully. I don't like staying in that patrol craft not able to do something!</p><p>Not doing anyhing? well, that's not entirely true, but what I did, didn't help really. Maybe here I also did a little mistake, but noone did see it in the end. Well, maybe it wasn't a mistake, maybe anything else would have got me killed..In the end we won, so maybe I did everything right regarding my ship actions?: <br>What you haven't considered was that I had the skill cold blooded. That skill helped me btw very much on this ship, where in the end 13 people died and never so many at same time that I lost any ap of cold blooded</p><p>So I was without aps in space, but after you killed Stephen and Raluca I already had 6 ap again.<br>Now I remembered from my earlier ship inspection , that NOT ONLY IAN IS IN FC, but also someone dropped the PLASTENITE ARMOR there &gt;.&lt;<br>I thought you would obviously hide there as soon a spossible and without much thinking I landed again with my 6 ap, went to FC, did just pick up the armor and did take off quickly again since I was that low on hp (3 hp).<br>In the hindsight I wonder whether it would have been better when I would have saved my aps and waited until someone tried to kill you to help that person. But I expected you with hardboile and armor with Ian, which would have been big trouble for us... and I had to be quicker in FC than yourself...<br>But now I am sitting in patrol craft again, unable to do anything again and seeing that noone else is there to do anything :/</p><p>The crew seems so inactive...and who can I trust, I don't know the second mush? <br>Wait, Janice was active before mush selection, maybe, just maybe she will be active again and can do something, I hope so, because otherwise there is probably not much hope ( I had similar expectations who is active and who not like you posted it in your first answer, Impet). She could be your mush partner, then I would have a big problem, but... chances are low, especially since you rampaged alone, with the active Janice as partner maybe you would have waited a bit longer..? I have to risk it! So I was writing with Janice, actually even before you told in public chat that she is mush (which relieved me, so I did write to the right person! ) . I told her about the location of the hidden knife and whether she could kill you when eating something. At same time I feared every second that you would transfer into her and know then about the knife... But you didn't, probably because you liked your strong Chao-body. <br>And luckily, just in time, Janice was awake, did her best to kill you, did give you that fatal illness...before being killed by Roland shortly afterwards.<br>Her sacrifice was essential for us, a great move!<br>So..Janice and Chao dead then, Roland in space, enough ap for me to get rid of him again <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And then the struggling and the great time of the 3 mushketeers began. In the begnning I thought we would be 4 mushketeers, but Finola died unexpectedly before being online to tell about her big morale problem. Also with my aps I tried to give eleesha and kuan a bit morale, but Finola was in a different room and..we had many new problems. Hunters.</p><p>Oh, luckily Kuan Ti and Eleesha were awake, and very willing to help and it was a great time with them. We figured we could only focus on pilgred. While I tried to take care of the hunters. 8 hunters. For one person a big problem.<br>What did we do? My friends helped loading fuel and so I moved the ship. 8 hunters again. Moved again... 8 hunters again. <br>Moved again...<br>4 hunters! Yes!<br>Ok, some cycles no damage and now only 4 hunters. with eating and shooter points no problem.</p><p>At same time Kuan and Eleesha made big progress ( Eleesha read the tech book).<br>When we got 8 hunters again, I killed 4 of them since I was offline for some cycles afterwards.</p><p>Pilgred did progress..</p><p>But at day 3 cycle 8 I faced a personal problem: morale. With Eleesha I already did the thing at day 2, I also hugged Schroedinger already. But I had only 3 morale left and Chun was dead at that time.<br>Eleesha had trouble with her internet connection, she actually did want to do the thing with me before day change and afterwards, but.. her internet broke down again.<br>So I had only 1 morale after daychange. One panic attack and I am done. Even with doing the thing.<br>So with Kuan I prepared to finish pilgred at that cycle. And gave both of them morale, so...in case Eleesha doesn't return they will survive and finish pilgred without me. <br>But she did return. Just at the time when I wanted to decide use aps to run away from the current new hunter wave ( I think 16 again :/) again and go to sleep. <br>And therefore we were able to finish pilgred with our combined effort <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And especially all the three of us!</p><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_8288031 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8288031">tiska</span>, yes, I only thought you were a new player because of you being bronze, you did very fine, thx for waiting at day4c1 for Eleesha to return! I am glad you enjoyed the game though we had so much trouble. Or because we had so much trouble and made it still? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And Eleesha, I now see it was even only her second game. Very impressive!</p>
