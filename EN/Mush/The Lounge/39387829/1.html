                <p>Forgive me for the pun, I just had to.</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4390" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4390</a></p><p>An MMM ship, with many great people on it. I was Jin Su, your glorious captain, always hoarding a bed somewhere to fly both in, or out the Daedalus.</p><p>The mush hunt was fun, and oh so underwhelming, with one dying on the first few days (IT IS ALWAYS STEPHEN OR JIN SU!), while the second one hiding undder the hood for a good amount of time. Most researches were done, the circle of subjects got fewer and fewer until we had to do a Natamy Rifle test. Roland was the second one, who got (DUN DUN DUUUN) RETURNED TO HUMANITY. Then proceeded to starve to death only a day after. <em>Siiiiigh</em> At least he gave lots of work to the mush hunting team since he was inactive in his mush days, as after them. Yay.</p><p>Since I was the captain I was left out of the loop for a good while before getting ill, so others may know what happened during these times.</p><p>Apart from that everything was great! Neron projects were completed left and right, Paola did <em>EVERYTHING EVER</em>, research was done at the same rate, it's great! Except that even with 3 people actively scanning most of the time, our planet results were utter *words redacted*.<br>Since scanning is such a gamble, I would even say that we can be happy for all the o2 planets, since Fuel and starmap fragments were so scarce most of the time, hence the bad title pun.<br>We tried, and could have hardly done more I think.</p><br><p>Let's see the crew from the captain's perspective...</p><p>We had a newbie Eleesha, who did the tutorial on the ship and never came back. Couldn't sold her.<br>A Derek was...alive? I think? Said something once before dying. I actually have no diea about him, apart from the fact that we couldn't kick neither of the two to a storage.<br>Hua was...I don't know. I was thinking and decided to report her on the end screen for possible XP farming as noted there.</p><p><strong>AND YOU GUYS WERE GRRRRREAT!</strong><br>Andie, Chun and Ian in the lab, working and healing diligently when needed.<br>Frieda, Gioele and Paola, all day on the bridge (or refectory) pushing lots of buttons (then Frieda got lost. May she rest in peace, her I-WIN button probably broke).<br>Terrence and me sleeping in the dorms for pilot duty (even with only one pilot, then two -&gt; three pilots we were in a good shape all times) and keeping up everything in shape with Kuan-Raluca. <br>Janice keeping our morale high, needing loads of speeches after she unfortunately died.</p><p>I'm not giving you guys enough credit for all the work you have, so be sure to check in and tell why you were the best! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>(Terrence, I'm waiting on your response if you were right or wrong.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)</p><p><strong>Edit</strong>: Oh I almost forgot. In case you couldn't read why did we return to sol, Raluca/Gioele/Terrence agreed that returning to sol was the best scenario now, as we had a hard time keeping up with the random events. We could have stayed for 1-2 days at least, but having low o2/fuel with steel plates and panic attacks every cycle would mean that at least one person would die. Raluca started this and we agreed that it would be a high risk gamble after so many days of scanning. I would have waited for a longer time for others to react, but I'll IRL sleep soon, so it would have been a few cycles where somebody would have died (with me, at least two people were critically injured, and Raluca having panic attacks all the time), I decided on this. Sorry for not giving you more time, but I think eventually this would have happened.</p>

                <p>Chun here! Roland's inactivity certainly made the hunt hard and Jin Su was a little difficult to trust from our end until sickness got him confirmed human. We resisted the idea of a blanket food test, determined that we'd get that sneaky mush somehow or another. Gioele finally stepped in and said enough is enough, we need to get the Natamy Rifle and Ultra-Healing Pomeade fixed. And who can blame him? 7 days without Pilgred coffee is harsh on a poor Caffeine Junkie. Our suspects were Roland (Got dirty early in around the same time Stephen did), Janice (Left the shower dorm and re-entered immediately according to Kuan Ti), Derek (Was never on, when he did get on he was suspicious in general), and Hua (Dirty, had Medkit for a while, barely on). Since the ship was MMM and Stephen died so early (For saying he lost 3 HP when picking up Freezer), we figured Mush #2 would either give up mushery and hope to return to Sol or straight up quit and decided to go inactive.</p><p>Raluca took the Eleesha issue into her own hands and killed her off before we could sell her. Pretty sure we confirmed her starving, too..but we forgave Raluca since she was such an all-star tech. Even if she held onto the Alien Bottle Opener all the time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Don't remember who killed Derek, but he ended up dying before we could trade him off, so that left Janice, Roland, and Hua. Terrence, Frieda, and Kuan Ti hadn't shown any confirmed humanity but they did a lot to earn our trust so they were a part of our 'secondary' mush hunt. Kuan Ti had been doing a good job keeping an eye on suspicious activity and sharing it with me.</p><p>So we reach the Natamy Rifle point. Gioele hungrily picked it up after the awesome Andie and Ian helped me to finish it along with the Pomeade and teamed up with Raluca, who had the cure since I was at work, to begin unveiling our 7 Day sneaky menace. Janice was the first target, that dorm thing was just too darn suspicious. Bang! Healed up, she checked out fine...although she wasn't very happy about being shot <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Thankfully she had plenty of AP lying around to get her injury fixed. Gioele and Raluca weren't ready to give up though; Roland was next. Bang! 1 heal, still not full. Raluca took hold of her trust serum and jammed it in his neck, mush on the crewbar removed! HUZZAH! I've never seen a mush cured, so good job again you guys!<br>....except, Gioele was out of energy and had to go and no one was on to keep an eye on Roland to keep him cured. I got back from work a minute before cycle change, made a long post asking where Roland and the Medkit is so I could effeciently get him healed and back to the Lab, cycle changed, and Roland died. BLARGH! We wanted to interrogate him, too..Ian told me not to blame myself but if I had gotten home just a bit sooner I could have probably saved him.</p><p>Mush hunt aside, we had some real bad luck. The fires were vicious, I cried a little when we lost half our plants. Scans didn't go so well either it seems; I wasn't really paying attention to that since I was spending most of my time on healing.</p><p>All in all, this was a fantastic ship, I'd love to fly with you all again! Ian and Andie were such awesome research partners, we shared Medlab very well and ensured a healthy flow of AP between us. Gioele was the perfect Gioele, I fear for how much sleep he might have missed IRL getting coffee. Poor Paola got stuck updating Neron to insane levels by the slave driver Kuan Ti. We had Biologist, Botanist, Chef and Shooter mage books. I wasn't able to finish glory research but we got some done.</p><p>I gotta sign off now, hope to see you all again in another life!</p>

                <p>As a first time Ian, I'll probably be plenty disappointed with the people I have to work with in the future.<br>Chun and Andie were just the best lab partners I could have asked for. <br>Literally nothing compares to those two awesome people I had to share the lab with.<br>And Gioele finding that jumpkin just made this the greatest experience.</p><p>I was thinking Jin Su was a traitor mush because of how much bad luck we had on the first few expeditions, but that bad luck made him sick too, so there went that theory. The bad luck never stopped though.<br>And the unusual amounts of strange items being broken also fueled my paranoia, as cameras and equipment broke. <br>Trying to make sense of it got Janice shot first as the mush test began. Sorry, Janice! You really had been helpful. We just didn't think it could have been a coincidence. You were in the lab 4 cycles before the camera broke.<br>And we really did get lucky when Gioele (I think it was) healed Roland after testing the natamy rifle on him. He didn't know that it always said "Healed for 4<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">" so he based his mush test on a bit of a false number. It worked out though! <br>Oh and thanks for being so generous with your gold days Gioele. We probably wouldn't have made it this far without you. You too Kuan Ti!<br>And I'm sure we would have gotten farther had Janice still been alive. A shame she got so unlucky with the hunger/steel plate combo.</p><p>After the mush were all gone, and my beautiful jumpkins had all matured I thought we were set for life. Enough oxygen to last 31 days, all you can eat, life was good. <br>Then fire happened and we were down to 4 plants and oxygen was leaking and nobody noticed until we were in the most pickled pickle. Things were breaking left and right, and I just had to abandon the research lab since there was no way we could keep researching in an environment like this. It think this was the saddest time I experienced on this ship. <br>We had gotten all the meaningful research out of the way though, including the calculator.</p><p>We had just a few cycles left of oxygen when we set out on our last expedition. We managed to get the oxygen, but lost Frieda.. I didn't get to know her very well, but she had been great on expeditions and she saved Terrences life just before she got lost. Her survival skill left Terrence with 1<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> after the expedition. We went back for her, but she was crushed under a rock.<br>After that we just couldn't keep up with repairing the ship and spent all day every day healing and repairing. And Ralucas morale situation was really worrying me. And when Terrence also started getting low, we decided that it was time to go home.</p><p>Oh, and Paola that crazy lady got Neron upgraded to 10. Too bad we couldn't last long enough to properly get all the Neron upgrades from the core. And its really too bad we got so many bad projects from those upgrades. But congratulations and well done!</p><p>I think of all the ships I've been on, this was the one I'll remember the most. <br>But it already feels like a distant memory. How it all started and how it got to where we were at the end, it just feels like so many things happened. It feels like it was so long ago. <br>Every day had its challenges and victories with research and planting. And later just staying alive was the challenge and not dying was the victory.</p><p>I've probably forgotten a lot of things, but all the active crew were great. I really was lucky to be in a ship with so many active and friendly people.<br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/CjSA1EW.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/CjSA1EW.png</a></p>

                <p>Andie here! You guys were a blast to fly with, even if things did get a little hairy at the end. (At the start of Day 13, I got plated and electrocuted at the same time - brought me down to 4 or so health. And there wasn't a single cycle after that that I didn't get at least a room shake. I swear that ship was trying to kill me!)</p><p>I'm still fairly new to the game, and I was honestly hoping to be Paola or Raluca - something where being a bronze player wouldn't hurt the ship too much (I have them leveled up to have Logistics and Technician.) But as soon as the choices came up, I knew I had to prevent Yet Another Pilot Andie from ruining the party. I'm glad I did. Our research team was amazing, and the whole crew was just fun. Everybody played with an eye to their role (Gioele in particular had some amazing banter); but even when we had grumpy old men clashing with bright-eyed youngsters in chat, the atmosphere was friendly and everybody cared about keeping each other alive.</p><p>Derek was mostly inactive, though he did come back once just to be a bit of a butt (he took a bed with full AP just because somebody had pointedly mentioned it was being left open for somebody else). After that, he just let himself starve until a steel plate ended things. Roland was an exciting moment - risky test out of desperation, positive diagnosis, and cured! - but he had been gone long enough that he was marked as inactive the next cycle, and since he wasn't on to tell us about injuries, he bled out faster than we were expecting. Hua was having some difficulty in real life, and she did come back to ask if we wanted her to stick around, but starved to death without saying anything else.</p><p>It was a shame the planet scans just weren't panning out, but in the end we couldn't keep up with all the repairs and healing that needed done. Still, this is the farthest I've ever gotten, and I want to thank all of you for your hard work.</p><p>Special thanks to-<br><strong>Gioele</strong>, both for amazing interaction and for being the driving force in the Mush hunt. The rest of us were more cautious and maybe too much so; you made sure that what needed to be done, was.<br><strong>Chun</strong> and <strong>Ian</strong>, the other two parts of the research team. You both worked hard, yet were willing to give up the medlab bed on a moment's notice to make sure somebody else got a turn. You were also great at communicating and arranging relays to push things out, even if we were doing them secretly. Chun especially deserves a round of applause, for managing all this while having to work around a road trip! Ian, I'm so sorry about the Jumpkins, that was just the worst luck.<br><strong>Paola</strong>, for plugging away at Xyloph and updates at our request, even if it was boring to sit up on the bridge the whole game. Thank you also for being willing to trust me especially.<br><strong>Kuan Ti</strong>, for the gold project and other generous donations to ensure the ship had all the skills it needed. I also think you aren't a native english speaker, so double thanks for being willing to do so much organizing - I couldn't even imagine playing in another tongue!<br><strong>Raluca</strong> and <strong>Terrence</strong>, for fixing things almost as fast as they broke. There was just too much for you two to handle, even with the drones helping, but without you we never would have gotten as far as we did.</p><p>(If you aren't tired of my novels yet, I also kept a journal for this ship - <a href="http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/ship/v/4390" target="_blank">http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/ship/v/4390</a> )</p>

                <p>Just finished reading Andies Journal. It was fun reading it and suddenly remember things that happened way early in the game. I had almost forgotten the lunch Chun bought us, and who were and weren't trusted, and what projects we did. And I completely forgot how suspicious we were of Derek before he died. <br>I had to laugh when you mentioned the success karma we had built up on day 3. <br>It sure did come back to bite us in the end.</p>

                <p>Gioele here. It's a shame the planet scanning wasn't on our side, Frieda seemed to get endless volcanoes and mankarogs, and the amount of swamps and forest planets I found drove me up the wall. We had such good luck with the scans on the first days where we just couldn't stop getting cristalites and we were worried about fuel of all things. Too bad that 2/3 of those gave us MIA and in the later days a dead Frieda <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">. It's sad she and Janice didn't get to join us the rest of the way.</p><p>But despite that, This ship was amazing and filled with people who knew their stuff and were fun to talk with. It was one of the only ships I've been on where I wasn't bored to log in during the mid game where the mush are all dead and everyone wanders looking for things to do. Roland being fairly inactive made the mush hunt pretty scary and intense suspecting the wrong people and wondering who was going to rampage and ruin our chances, by sitting in the dorm quietly. Even if the medkit test was actually false in this case since I jumped the gun and shot Roland when he wasn't on full health, that little box pretty much caught both of the mush at some point.</p><p>And heh, yes, moving from 12ap per day to 28ap per day not including jumpkins and time spent in bed is a suprisingly good motivator to kill mush as quickly as possible. Checking my statistics, I think I went from a little over 10 coffees drank to 66 on one journey. But really I've had bad experiences with waiting and watching when it comes to finding mush so I tried to push us away from caution, guess it worked <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">. Not to mention that kicking down that door with Raluca and shooting that mush that kept us paranoid for 7 days in the face was satisfying as hell, curing him is probably one of my favourite moments I've had in mush (I may have played that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GwjfUFyY6M">celebrate</a> song about 5-10 times and gotten it associated with mush now).</p><p>In terms of the individuals?<br><strong>Jin Su</strong> - Even though we got off on the wrong foot, and I threatened to kill you during the oxygen crisis (<img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> so embarrassing when we invited you into the mush hunt chat and I'd left that gem of a comment in there). You were a pretty cool guy and you were mostly around when we needed you to move the ship, launch the expeditions and keep morale high.<br><strong>Terrence</strong> - The wheelchair pilot god that basically became Roland once you had gone gold again, without you around Jin Su would have been swarmed by hunters out there, we wouldn't have had all the drones and we wouldn't have made it nearly as far as we did.<br><strong>Andie</strong> - Fun to talk to and gets props for probably being the only person that stayed in character for the whole trip (sir!). Great help on the mush hunt and on the research team, it's going to be sad going back to bronze pilot Andie's that never talk that's for sure.<br><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> - Kept the mush hunt progressing in the early days and the ship interesting in the later days, it was a great idea with the neron updates as we ended up with nearly all of the good projects available.<br><strong>Chun</strong> - With the puns that could cure cancer (or the mush in this case), fun to be around and kept the crew alive when steel plates were becoming a fact of life aboard the deathtrap. Getting you the biologist book skyrocketed our research efforts as well.<br><strong>Ian</strong> - Even though we lost half the plants, those jumpkins were extremely helpful and your mycologist probably saved me from being turned by Roland (perhaps that's why he gave up?). Let the pumpkins reign for centuries to come.<br><strong>Raluca</strong> - The tech machine, at times when I wanted to give up and go home with everything smoking and broken, I'd suddenly see the malfunctioning equipment count plummet, as you whisked right under me and fixed everything in sight.<br><strong>Gioele</strong> - Inactive and dumb as bricks. (going through everyone's names as I see them on the honors list)<br><strong>Paola</strong> - Spent pretty much the entire trip on the bridge going "update neron, update neron <img src="../../../../gfx/square/drowl.png" alt=":drowl:" class="tid_ico">", but it turned out to be fruitful as we became showered in presents from neron. Happy you had the strength to press the same button for 2 weeks straight and stick with us.<br><strong>Janice and Frieda</strong> - You may not have been able to join us to see the finish line, but maybe you'll be happy to hear that without you, your respective fields began to crumble as morale became a serious issue and we never got a good planet after Frieda died.</p><p>Now with all that done? Time to buckle up and go through Andie's journal, as I opened day 2 and saw it was almost as long as this thread I knew I was in for some good times.</p>

                <p>Paola, the Neron Master, partial time botanist and Princess of the Pumpkin Kingdom.</p><p>It's a pity we were so unlucky with starmap pieces and expeditions in general but it was a really fun experience. Hope to see you all again soon!</p><p>It's the first time I reach Neron upgrades version 10 and it was a painful experience. Every participation in the last level was around 2-5% but I guess it was worthy. It's a pity we haven't taken advantage that much of it.</p><p>The mush hunt was amazing until Roland died from inactivity. Such a sad end for that.</p><p>Thanks to:<br><strong>Jin Su</strong> - Well played commander. We were suspecting on you being mush until that expedition where you got ill. You were always where we need you to be.<br><strong>Frieda</strong> - The bridge was so empty after you died! Thanks for all your planets and scans, which help us a lot in the early game. I guess one of the reasons we haven't reached Eden is your loss. <br><strong>Terrence</strong> - Your drones were soooo useful. We couldn't make it that far without them and without your help dealing with hunters.<br><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> - My overlord and slaver. You did pretty well organizing Neron Upgrades and Neron projects. And your planets which saved us of suffocating. I won't forget your funny speeches.<br><strong>Chun</strong> - It's always hard to find a good Chun but you did it amazingly well. Thanks for keeping me alive from all the steel falling from the roof.<br><strong>Ian</strong> - My botanist partner! Well done taking care of our plants. I can feel the same pain when I saw those four hydropots burning. I hope you don't have any complains about my plants neither.<br><strong>Raluca</strong> - Stuff were broking and Raluca were always fixing it. Well done! I think it's the first time I see Raluca curing a mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Gioele</strong> - You were awesome! King Pumpkin will always rule our destiny! You were the driving force of the ship.<br><strong>Janice</strong> It's a pity you died. We had some morale issues in the late game because of it. Bad luck.<br><strong>Andie</strong> Second ship in a row we meet. I recognized you from our previous ship before but I haven't said anything about that because you were RPing really well. Well played again! It's always a pleasure to play with people like you.</p>

We may have laughed at you as you died but you did your duty to the mush and we're curious to see where those 2 spores went. We're going to know who you are at some point anyway. You too, Roland!</p>

Day 10 on that ship was much harder than day 20 on my previous ship… We were too busy in real life: Janice, Roland, Darek, Hua are dead cause of problems IRL.

I’m glad that you can use golden days on another ship ( <em>Will it grant you silver status afterwards?</em> ) It is a pity that our roles were so different on the ship. <br><strong>Derek Hogan: </strong> [ <em>Victim of starvation</em> ] Person who died of starvation without Inactive status and with bed usage <br><strong>Eleesha Williams: </strong> [ <em>Drooling machine</em> ] The tutorial was too hard for this person <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Frieda Bergmann: </strong> [ <em>Must scan planets <img src="../../../../gfx/square/zombie.png" alt=":zombie:" class="tid_ico"> </em> ] Did her job well... Died like a hero. <br><strong>Gioele Rinaldo: </strong> [ <em>All hail the Jumkin King!</em> ] Most of the fun RP moments were connected with you my friend! Thank you for being on that ship! You did your job well and your glory is love of whole crew of the ship. It is a pity that we had no time for a good conversation about space travels with cup of coffee and cigar.<br><strong>Ian Soulton: </strong> [ <em>Don Juan of Daedalus</em> ] Make love not war. The phrase was interpreted by Ian literally and most of women of the ship gained morale through that guy! Good and reliable buddy who did his job well.<br><strong>Janice Kent: </strong> [ <em>Silent beauty </em> ] She was listening about all problems of the ship without any word… It is a pity that silence killed her. <br><strong>Jiang Hua: </strong> [ <em> Silent Pilot </em> ] On day 10 she told us about problems IRL and died on the next day. <br><strong>Kim Jin Su</strong> [ <em>Can I kill him?</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"> ] I instigated crew to kill you 3 or 4 times during our voyage. I think you are a good player, but commander's role is very hard during MMM ships, so don’t take it if you are not confident in your abilities to log on every cycle! No hard feelings. ( <em> We all know that you launched ship to Sol because you were the first in my Eden-kill-check-list! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> </em> )<br><strong>Lai Kuan Ti:</strong> [ <em>Your loyal servant</em> ] With Kuan Ti I was trying to be an expert in Neron projects. Most of them were created or recommended by my character or Raluca. Calculation, Science and Design! That's what led me through the whole game ( <em> Besides calculation on Neron Project and Starvation time I've made some improvements to Andie's spreadsheet. That was fun! </em>) <br><strong>Paola Rinaldo:</strong> [ <em> Jumkin Queen. Neron update addict <img src="../../../../gfx/square/drowl.png" alt=":sq_drowl:" class="tid_ico"> </em> ] <em> Would you kindly upgrade Neron to level 10? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> </em> What I have lost in Raluca… I have found in you. It was pleasure to encourage a young genius girl for greater deeds... and after to see that Paola is eager to help a ship even after comms is completely done! Nice to meet you!. It is a pity that I forgot to mention you in my last words <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Raluca Tomescu:</strong> [ <em> Alien Bottle Opener Fetishism </em> ] It’s great to have an active Technician on board and it is great sadness to have him silent. We were unable to raise your morale most of time because you were writing in chat without reading it. Please remember one thing: it’s crucial to share critical equipment like Bottle Opener with team! Even if you trying to RP Antisocial character.<br><strong>Roland Zuccali:</strong> [ <em>Dead hope of Daedalus</em> ] Played like inactive mush and died like inactive human. <br><strong>Stephen Seagull</strong> [ <em>Fastest death on the ship</em> ] So many mistakes! So fast dead! <br><strong>Terrence Archer:</strong> [ <em>What can possible go wrong?</em> ] Solid player with crazy ideas and a little bit of RP. It was fun to see dancing drones in bravo dorm and your paranoia about Paul! How it feels… when you regaining ability to fly? <br><strong>Zhong Chun:</strong> [ <em>Hello Nurse!</em> ] Great mush hunt, Great research work, Great help to the ship in all aspects. It is a pity that you didn't have time to RP but it's not important with such active person like you!</p><br><p><em>P.S. It seems that I need to improve my English skills a little bit more <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":sq_confused:" class="tid_ico"> But I hope that it was pleasant to speak with me during our trip. </em></p>

I'll let you know if I stay silver or not; my new ship will enjoy three-skill Janice at least, but my talkie and tracker have stayed separate items.

                <p>You did tell us, and I was appropriately amused/slightly worried. XD I think the closest I've had to a mush dream was some sort of cross between it and TF2, staged as a water balloon fight in some mansion? The red team were called "mush" and could infect the blue team, but allegiance wasn't hidden and it seemed more like an organized game than an actual fight.</p><p>(Also because I promised to report earlier, no you do not get silver for gifted gold days. A pity, but I suppose it's only fair; they'd get a quarter of the sales because people would gift the other three weeks they bought to spread the skills.)</p>

                <p>Nowadays, I dream about something that might be entirely unrelated to mush and yet somewhere along the way it would work its way in. I remember dreaming about an oldschool Resident Evil styled game where I saw Chun dying in a corner and trying to make my way to her to go heal her but I fell through a crack in the ground and died. Then I woke up as Kuan Ti staring down the crack I died at but the camera angle was looking up at me from below so I could see a pattern on the ceiling, marking where the traps were. I woke up before I could use them to get to Chun :/</p>
