                <p>I was the commander of a ship, and i used to give a lot of speeches in the beginning, of our trip, after that i became a healer - healed Janice and Hua and some others. I jogged good on the ship, conversing AP to MP really well. Also i got a Magebook Pilot and shot some things.

                <p>We're a D12C1 returned to Sol ship, surviving against all odds. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>First Griefer</em></p><p>For starters, ship began in D1C7 and filled in D2C2. Sometime between that, Griefer Chao went around hiding everything important. Soap. Apron. Mush Sample. Blaster. Sofa BP. Both the Banana Plants. Pots. Other important things that I don't even remember anymore.</p><p>He also picked up Armor and Blaster, ate both bananas and a Ration. Just so he could try to kill me...by emptying his clip into me before replacing bullets with his fists. He came pretty close, but I survived because of pure luck. I had 2 HP left at the end of it.</p><p>Of course, being out of AP wasn't going to stop him from griefing, so he accused me of being a mush who spored in a turret (untrue of course). Fortunately, his particularly foul and potty mouth turned the crew against him. They trusted me over him, and chose to kill him. Janice made the killing blow.</p><p><em>First Mush</em></p><p>It wasn't very long after the griefer's attack when Mush Stephen suddenly threw a grenade into the Lab with Kuan Ti, Chun and myself inside. Kuan Ti died instantly. But he was an inactive, so we didn't really care. Stephen proceeded to pummel Chun into the ground, intending to kill our Nurse. He failed. Not that her survival made any difference. She didn't have Only Hope AND she was inactive!</p><p>Finola soiled her delicate little hands by plunging them into Stephen and ended him. My, there's more to that lady than meets the eye!</p><p><em>Second Mush</em></p><p>Our other mush was a lot more sneaky. I couldn't spot anything right away. For a few days, I wondered if the last much could be an inactive.</p><p>Then, a few red flags came up. <strong>Janice</strong> lied about starving. Well, MAYBE lying. No one really knew how soon a new player can start starving if they skipped tutorial. Janice complained about getting hurt lots by picking up objects. It wasn't proof, but it certainly raised her profle. <em>to be continued....</em></p>

                <p><em>Sleeper Griefer</em></p><p>Turns out, Paola was a sleeper griefer. At the start, she grabbed a plant an went inactive until it died. Then in Day 6 or something, she woke up suddenly and killed Gold Roland, our very active Pilot. She died of depression in the next cycle.</p><p>This was bad for us, because most ships don't survive long with only one pilot. So, active Jin Su read our Pilot Magebook and became our backup pilot to Hua.</p><p><em>Second Mush continued</em></p><p>Back to the second mush. I noticed some AP discrepency in Janice, but I couldn't be sure if she was semi-active or actually mush. It wasn't until we built Mycoscanner when we knew for sure. You see, I was infected with 2 spores...which was odd because I'm ALWAYS in Camera rooms!</p><p>Thus, I concluded that our second mush was a Trapper, and started examining the old logs to see who could've trapped me. Janice's name came up again. Using this new information, I sent Jin Su, Terrence, Frieda and Hua to check their infection levels, too...and sure enough, what they had was consistent with my hypothesis that Janice was a Trapper mush!</p><p>This created a dilemna. Chun didn't have Only Hope, and Jin Su was expected to spend all his APs on piloting. Killing Janice would end us, as we needed her shrink abilities.</p><p><em>Cat and mouse</em></p><p>So, we worked on a secret plan to cure Janice of her mushieness. It lead to some rather amusing exchanges while we were trying to trick each other. Some examples:</p><p>- <em>Janice</em>: I'm so clumsy - I got hurt picking up [some item]! Can I get healing?<br>- <em>Jin Su</em>: Healed you for 3HP.<br>- (In secret private chat) <em>Eleesha</em>: Don't heal her too many times...we don't want her to have the ability to secretly extract more spores!</p><p>Or another example:</p><p><strong>(Janice still hasn't changed CPU Priority to Research for days, despite being asked a few times, and we desperately needed her to do it to research the mush cure!)</strong></p><p>- <em>Eleesha</em>: Nah I don't think Janice is mush. I think she just missed this thread by accident. Anyway, let's try asking her again to change the BIOS setting and we'll see.<br>- <em>Eleesha</em>: Eep how embarrassing, posted in wrong thread!<br>- (In secret private chat) <em>Eleesha</em>: p.s. I intentionally posted in wrong thread, and I totally don't think she's human. I just wanted to "encourage" her to change the BIOS setting asap. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br>- (1-2 cycles later) <em>Janice</em>: Oh oops I somehow missed this! Sorry! It's changed now.<br>- (In secret chat) <em>Finola</em>: She actually did it.</p><p>While we were working on the mush cure, I even had to send still-clean Hua to intentionally trigger traps set by Janice because many of us (including myself) were really close to being converted by her numerous traps! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Needless to say, we completed the cure soon-ish and injected Janice with it. We pretended to not know Janice was mush right up to the very end, hehe. Fun times. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

What caught my attention was when someone announced in the general chat <strong>"Stephen threw a grenade in the lab!"</strong> This was my second ship and I didn't even know there were grenades on the ship, so I pretty much fell out of my chair! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/fear.png" alt=":fear:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Needless to say I did not recognize the true gravity of losing Roland to that griefer, but I was sure learning a lot about griefers! I had some concern about Roland because the others who were active were saying various things to the effect of "oh noes!" and then person I know IRL who told me about Mush game explained to me Roland is the Hunter killer and without him, well, you're pretty doomed. Great.</p><p>I am a gamer through and through so I decided it didn't matter if the ship was doomed, I would keep playing and learn as much as I could from playing Terrence. Turns out this was a very fortuitous choice as Eleesha whispered in my ear <span class="tid_preRoleplay">Eleesha</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Hey, how dedicated are you to finding our second mush? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> </span></span> LOL. <span class="tid_preRoleplay">Terrence</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Well, how can I resist such a pretty face offering to wheel me around and do things for her?<br></span></span> Actually, because I was still very knew, what I really said was probably something like...<span class="tid_preRoleplay">Terrence</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">I'm totally into it but I'm stuck in this room!</span></span> and then Eleesha explained how another crew member can help Terrence get around the ship with limited movement points.</p><p>So I teamed up with Eleesha to mush hunt, and more importantly to carry on lots and lots of <strong>mush research</strong> since Finola had been murdered by that mush Stephen. I don't know how many times we passed the Stainproof Apron back and forth to relay the various research....</p>

I've since read more of the Mushpedia and it made me laugh, recalling these exchanges.</p><p>The best part of the post-mush-hunting was going for the glory and always when I would see fires or hunters or broken equipment alerts, and I'd think <span class="tid_preRoleplay">Terrence</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Oh, we're so dead this cycle change.</span></span> there would be Eleesha in chat saying <span class="tid_preRoleplay">Eleesha</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">It's not as bad as it looks! Let me do some calculations.</span></span> and then she'd come back with this plan of how the two of us would move around the ship and fix things in that cycle, or shoot some araks from the turrets and then move the ship. I also upgraded two of our drones with Firefighter and Turbo and we'd just drop one where it needed to be.</p><p>Oh, yeah, and I was having so much fun that near the end I upgraded to gold so I could take Pilot. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> That was great fun, having Eleesha wheel me into a patrol ship so I could go shoot some hunters.<img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/cool.gif" alt=":anim_cool:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Yep. <strong>Good Times!</strong></p>

                <p>Hehe, oh yeah, good memories...I had so much fun in that ship, and a lot of it was because of how awesome Terrence was! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Oh, it turns out, I always doubt myself just before using Mush Cure! The same thing happened in my current ship, you see. I suspected someone. We rushed the cure. And then...well, you know. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Thanks for your recap, Terrence! That certainly brought back lots of good memories.
