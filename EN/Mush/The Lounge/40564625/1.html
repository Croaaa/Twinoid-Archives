                <p>End ship link: <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5058"></a><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5058" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5058</a></p><p>Jin Su, partnered with Stephen.</p><p><em>Many of you may not understand what the 'TE' in the title means.</em> Some of you will. I'll explain more about that one later, I have plenty of time to brag in this one.</p><p>Let's begin with the beginning.</p><p>Before I even jumped on this ship, I got a premonition. Call it whatever you want, but fifteen or so minutes before the cycle change where I would jump onto the ship, I got the feeling I'd wind up as mush.</p><p>My suspicions were soon confirmed, soon after the ship filled, I received my message that I was MUSH. But, of course, I was not alone, I received the aid of an old friend this time, a competent partner, and a skilled one at that. Immediately, we geared up for the long run, both of us having high level mush.</p><p>Despite our general skill and respective experience levels, there's something to be said for the crew. In particular, Raluca, Roland, Eleesha, Hua, and later Gioele, who were the true saviors of the ship. I'll explain their parts in our eventual rampage a little bit later. For now, what you need to know is that my partner and I both were gold and geared up for an early phago/fertile combo.</p><p>The crew was incredibly hyperactive, and movements were difficult. I can tell you honestly, there were many, many heart pumping moments where I couldn't be certain whether or not I was going to get caught, watching as the moments unfolded. Knowing that any number of things could happen to stonewall us. One of the most difficult of tasks was finding out reasons to be dirty.</p><p>The ideal Jin Su is never dirty, and the ideal Stephen never needs to be dirty, but we were lucky. Fate smiled on us. Two expos in a row, Stephen got dirty. The third expo, I got dirty. Extracting spores came easier, and we were able to move freely. But our biggest issue didn't come from from that, it came from the activity of this crew, and, as the title says, the eventual reason for the Mush rampage.</p><p>Stephen jellied the AD camera once. I'd scheduled a speech to give myself reason to be down there at the time of the camera breakage... Stephen latched a spore on, but Raluca fixed the camera 8 minutes after breakage. It was the beginning of our struggle.</p><p>The second green jelly came at the worst time possible, cycle 5, which was 6:00 A.M. for me. I decided to stay up late for it and ended up having to do a solo expo... where I got an illness event. I pretended to 'pass out' and watched in horror as Eleesha came in the room and healed me once, signalling the end of our chances at a long ship. Roland fixed the camera two minutes after breakage, and Stephen barely had time to spore him the second time before it went back up.</p><p>I made my way to AD and took a bed, claiming I didn't have the AP/MvtP to get back to bridge (which was true). Janice was then... killed right in front of us, obliterating Stephen's last cover.</p><p>We rampaged at D6C8</p><p>At that exact moment before we began our rampage, Hua shot me once. We had to move up our time table, smashing no less than 5 AP from my bar, not letting me get the sleep AP, forcing an early phagocyte because it was with the natamy, and not allowing me to issue the mission to Stephen. I completed the conversion of Roland in BD and he joined the rampage, myself killing Eleesha, and Stephderek killing Kuan-Ti and Raluca. We were all out of AP by then because of Hua's efforts.</p><p>Gioele woke up, went on a coffee rampage, and proceeded to kill all of the MUSH, leaving 7 human crew aboard, one drooling in AD for inactivity (the Derek Stephen had transferred with). Gioele tried to lead the crew to Sol anyways, but it was doomed to fail. Pilgred was at 0%. I watched until the end. Regardless of our differences, Paola, Ian, you did well to survive that long. The odds were stacked against you.</p><p>Whatever the case, there's a question I posed at the beginning of this AP that I have yet to answer. You see, TE is the name of a meta... My meta. It stands for Towards Eden, and I would not be lying when I say that I have never been more proud of them than I am now.</p><p>Among other things, the day this ship launched was my farewell jump. The last ship I would be on in Mush for another ten months, since I knew I had to abandon the timesink. If you doubt our efficiency, you'll just have to note that of the 16 players on this ship, a solid 8 were TE players.</p><p>Now don't get me wrong! Just because we like playing together, doesn't mean we won't try to kill each other if we're on opposite teams. Gioele, in fact, the person who killed us, was TE as well. We're a family! We're just a bit dysfunctional, eh? I'll let you in on a group joke, Gioele finally gained the coveted distinction of completing 'AAA', Always Assassinate Aaeni. Don't ask me where they got it, cause I dunno.</p><p>Whatever the case, I'm proud to say we're pretty legit, and we're fantastic at shaming MMM players. TE members are known not only for the D2C8 MMM rush, wherein I proudly returned a full ship to Sol, but also for the MMM Eden trip... with Mush aboard. You're a badass, Sage. Genuine badass.</p><p>I sought permission from them for this final AP of mine for a while to reveal TE because I wanted to be able to brag about them, and I can honestly say I've never been prouder, because I know they're some of the best damn mush players on this server. Roleplayers and members of one great big family, where we all abide by the rules and expect every member to do the same. We try our best to bring a whole new standard of quality.</p><p>So, keep us in mind when you're on a ship that seems waaay more awesome than it should be. TE members are everywhere, from random jumps to group jumps, filling up MMM ships and even just regular weekday jumps. We'll try our hardest to be that extra standard of quality for people to measure up to, and bring one more level of amazing to every ship we find ourselves on. I owe my success in MUSH to TE, and my continued playing of MUSH to them as well. It wouldn't have been the same without such a fantastic group behind me.</p><p>Thank you, Mush, for bringing me all of these amazing people. Thank you, TE, for standing behind me always through thick and thin, from practically the beginning.</p><p>I'll miss you all.</p><p>Aaeni out.</p>

                <p>You forgot to say that you are also infamous for bringing an awesome ship to Sol on d7 because you clicked the wrong button <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico">! (Yes, I'll always remind you of that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> ).</p><p>Congrats for the remaining players for lasting this long! I kept checking to see when the ship would be finished. In case it's not obvious by my avatar, I was Eleesha.</p><p>As the ship was filling up I was just hoping for 2 things: 1, I didn't want to be mush, 2, i was hoping Aaeni wouldn't be mush. Alas, the first one came through but not the second. This was one of the hardest mush hunts I had to do, both Jin Su and Stephen were on my short list of 4/5 top suspects but they were playing very, very sneaky and I don't really like to kill people without being very sure they are mush. I was keeping an eye on logs, I was keeping an eye on ap spent (didn't help that some active people were not reporting their ap properly), keeping an eye on suspicious behavior but there were still not many strong leads about mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p><p>On the last day I was alive, we were again low on o2 and after I hacked us to a planet, Jin Su launched a solo expo. I saw that there was swamp in the planet so I knew there would be a chance of illness. When he was apparently offline after the expo ended I decided to go heal him once. I knew it would be a chase game, if he was mush and there was an illness I knew he wouldn't give me the expo link but that would give me enough security he was hiding something. If I hadn't healed him, he could have claimed to have a migraine that disappeared on cycle change.</p><p>But that was also when everything went lose with alpha dorm camera being broken again and Roland getting a second spore. Janice had showed up online just minutes before (and minutes after I hacked the terminal after asking if she was around to do it). Together with the fact that she had decided to go pick the grenade was enough to get us to kill her with the natamy. Turns out we were wrong and she was human. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> That really affected me, if there's something I truly hate is to be wrong and kill an innocent human. I admit we could have still gone with killing Stephen and Jin Su but I wanted to have some extra security and went to print the list. If Roland was telling the truth, the chance of there being beta mush would have been low because the mush were never given many options to convert people. The list came with Roland, Gioele and Jin Su's name. It was enough for me and I asked the confirmed humans chat to kill Jin Su <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"> but... no one reacted. I had very little ap, Hua had gone offline with the natamy riffle, Paola had left the PM after I printed the list because she said I wanted mush to win with printing it. So after 5 or 6h waiting for reactions and help, I just went to sleep irl. And when I woke up, Jin Su had already killed me.</p><p>Could I have acted earlier? Yes. Did I have evidences to act earlier? No, the kills would have been a gamble. I read after my dead people complaining I stopped them from killing Jin Su earlier but if you were all so sure, you could have take the matters in your own hands. Also Ian, I hope you don't think you are a genius for saying Jin Su was mush after 20min in the game. Because you had absolutely NO evidence at the time. The only thing he did was leave the lab and go to the bridge saving his ap. Which is what I expect a pilot to do. (I won't miss you either!)</p><p>But to the really important things:<br>It was great to play with most of you, and I'm glad I got the chance to get on a ship with you again Aaeni! (I just hate that you outplayed me and that I didn't get to AAA myself!).</p><p>I will take the chance to thank you in public for putting TE together and inviting me there. I hope we get another ship together when you're back, and hopefully we will really go towards eden on that one!</p>

                <p>Roland here.</p><p>I was converted under a camera during a mush rampage while online. I tried to join in with the few AP I had, but didn't really achieve anything with my grenade throwing and few hits at Gioele. In hindsight, I should probably just have helped finish Terrence off. It didn't matter much as the alphas' rampage was sufficient to kill the ship (even if it took a while longer than expected), but it did add to my general feeling of frustration on my last day:</p><p>As human I had known that I had two spores, but had had no way to remove them while the only person with a research skill (Ian) seemed to ignore me and only care about gardening at the time. <br>I was also fairly certain that Stephen was mush after Janice's death, but I couldn't get the confirmed humans' approval to kill him. They didn't know with the same certainty as I did that I wasn't lying about my spores (which was a major part of the evidence) and I guess my presence on the list didn't exactly help. I could have tried to kill him myself, but I didn't have that many AP and I guessed it would have looked rather bad if I made an unsuccesful attack without approval.</p><br><p>At least I got to play with Aaeni before he wanders off. It is always a pleasure to meet good mushes who try the long game and only resort to rampaging when they have no other option.</p>

                <p>It was around 11 hours from the medkit incident and a little less from when Janice was killed Other than myself, Janice was the only one that could have jellied and spored in Alpha Dorm both times. I was pretty sure one of us would end up dead while I was at work. Instead we both were able to fill our AP bars until day change.</p><p>Also, I don't think anyone saw what happened after Ian (last human alive) got plated, but it was pretty amazing. I know I was the last to put in my final words, so you guys probably didn't see.</p><p>Anyway, right after the final plate fell, Schrodinger knew he had to act, and soon. He hatched a plan with NERON for a cycle until the titles passed to Schrodinger. He galloped to the Nexus with the mush disk, formatting it, then filling it with all of the astronavigational charts, as well as a copy of NERON's core. He flipped off the pilot lock with his tail and crawled into E-Street with the disk. Moments later he has NERON's core up and running on the patrol ship's computer, and plots a course for Cat Eden. Schrodinger prepares himself for an epic catnap.</p><p>After a couple years, Schrodinger lands on Cat Eden, greeted by all the other ship cats that manage to outlive the humans. He gives his new friends a meow, and lives in cat paradise happily ever after.</p>

I'm curious to how someone managed to kill a human with a natamy. It's extremely difficult as surviving 3 shots confirms the person as human, which is a maximum of 12 HP damage on non-mush.
