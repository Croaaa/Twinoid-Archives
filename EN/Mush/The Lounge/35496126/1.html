This game really showed what Mush is all about. It has been the most active - and most successful ship out of all whopping 4 ships I have been part of. More important, the most fun one. Thank you all so much for this truly memorable experience!</p><p>Not only was everyone from the active crew nice and helpful, we also had loads and loads of chatter going one. I feel a bit sorry for Kuan Ti, since I might have talked a bit too much and in too confusing ways. But I guess antisocial and autism can show in many different ways.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">-</span></p><p>It all started off quit and calm when we awoke. The first cycles went smooth and Ian, who had apparently been among the first to awake, prepared a whole pile of organizational threads - which really brought us on track. He also made a newbie help thread, pointing out essential things to those who where all new and shiny. Morale was good, Schroedinger was strolling around the ship freely and we managed to build a sofa for Paola relatively fast. I spend my time alone in the Engine Room, plaguing the rest of the crew with my nonsensical chatter while they managed to manage the vessel we would name the DEAD ALL US later.</p><p>Sudden panic struck me as a bloody-minded attack on my morale revealed a mush aboard the ship. Right at the moment I decided to press a few buttons in Neron's project terminal Janice came down to the Engine Room. I suddenly felt much less inclined to continue my journey on this doomed vehicular entity. In sudden panic I immediately called Chun and told her in blunt words what had happened. The sudden loss of 4 morale left not much doubt to her. Our glorious captain Jin Su was also consulted, who seconded Chuns assumption. The fact that Janice had been silent, holding the soap while stinking like cheddar in Neron's Core also did nothing but reassure the thesis that she must have been infected a long time ago. Jin Su did not hesitate to grab a blaster and a knife, valiantly charged into the room, shot the wall and finally stabbed Janice to death. Neron confirmed her death and that she indeed was a mush.</p><p>In the meantime our crazy cook Stephen had been very efficient at cooking rations, even though he was commanded to not touch the kitchen equipment until requested. Chao, who had been drooling over blasters and turrets alike, was given the order to make him stop, but Stephen somehow managed to kill him. He also hid the blasters in the Refectory, where our investigative captain found them later. Roland finished off Stephen in what was quite a fight. Neron happily told us Stephen had been a human, no signs of mush infection.</p><p>As the days went by Paola did a great job on the bridge, gathering useful information from her rebel boyfriend and therefore gave us a lot of Neron projects for free. A list of samples we received confirmed only that Jin Su was no mush, all other samples had been inconclusive. She was enjoying her sofa much, I guess. Eleesha however had been drooling in the front corridor for a while. Around day 6 we cleverly came to the conclusion that she would have starved by now if she was not human. Jin took a blaster and shot her right in the face! Once more Neron happily announced Eleeshas death along with the information that we all were wrong and she was not mush at all.</p><p>While we made good progress with Neron, Ian's little farm kept on growing and we had a surplus of oxygen and bananas, Chun became more and more frustrated as the research did not progress further. Finola had been all over the ship, but none of us could actually tell what exactly her thought processes where. She researched useless stuff, if so, pushed on Neron project from 55% to complete within minutes and never spoke a word until she surprised as all with a rather long announcement that she was not mush and could not talk because of ... reasons. She surely was high on the likely-to-be-mush list. But the inner circle of the not-so-likey-to-be-mush did the best to stay calm and vigilant. Kuan Ti and Roland where both keeping us from killing anyone without enough evidence. And so Finola proceeded to do whatever she did.</p>

                <p>Kuan Ti, Terrence and myself continued projects while Ian helped out Chun with the reseach. Jin Su spend his time commandering us about - and he also ate all the bacon! After we finished the last project Kuan Ti proceeded to help with planet scanning, all the while Roland and Hua impressed us with their shooting skills. It must have been around that time where Paola joined an expedition and went for a swim in the ocean that was found. A deadly deathtrap it was! Her body was found later beneath a rock, alien ants all over the place - and the smell! This was a hard hit to most of us - not me, of course. What would I care?</p><p>Shortly thereafter we had to leave Hua behind as we concluded the risk of asteroids hitting the DEAD ALL US was too big to take. I still wonder what would have happened if we had waited. But it was a decision for the greater good, and rightfully so.</p><p>In a genius moment I completed the research for the retro fungal serum, also to scare the mush aboard since we still had no clue who was a true human. But we stayed vigilant, discussed and continued our journey as we had already found two starmap pieces.</p><p>Around day 10 (more or less) we finally got rewarded for our patience. One mush had made a mistake and spored right when our fearless leader entered Bravo Bay. I happened to enter seconds later and thus could confirm his observation. Chun, who not only had been our main researcher but also kept the most valuable items, such as the hacker kit, the armor and the serum, rushed to the scene and injected the serum into the veins of a person who never was even close to the top of our mush suspects list. Frieda, or the old hag, as she used to call herself, had been mush all along and we never knew. Only Kuan Ti suggested we might have a deep cover mush, but at this time Finola, Gioele and Terrence where the most suspected.</p><p>I am pretty sure Kuan Ti also did not trust me, but I wouldn't have done so, either - especially after one of our planned trips failed, as we never reached the planet. As I had fueled the engine I was a suspect, obviously. Of course I knew I had done my job well. I never found out if Frieda - who had found this planet - fooled us on purpose, or if indeed a mistake led us to empty space. Fortunately this was a non-critical point as we had plenty of fuel and oxygen left.</p><p>Frieda was happy to be human again and spent her time well helping Roland to rid us of hunters and collecting scrap. Terrence patched up the hull now and then while I was on repair-everything-that-breaks-oh-and-also-make-lots-of-coffee duty after PILGRED was fixed.<br>The DEAD ALL US really began to troll us now whenever it could. At least one oxygen tank both fuel tanks broke each cycle. Doors stopped functioning randomly and multiple fires had reduced Ians banana farm to a sad 4 trees, which he proceeded to convert into jumpkins.<br>While Frieda told us what little she remembered of her mush phase, we were pretty sure that all the mush threads had been dealt with, otherwise the next top suspect would have been the starship itself!</p><p>But we managed to keep on going! At some point Gioele starved to death, but he never had done anything useful at all. Finola and Terrence were taken from us shortly thereafter as the DEAD ALL US did not seem to like them much. They also failed to tell us how healthy they where, so nothing could be done about this. Gioele could have survived, as food never was a real problem. Our magnificent Jin had taken the duty of the chef - naturally, and prepared fine rations for the crew. I stuck to coffee and fruits for most of the time, but had to snatch a ration here and there in order to keep up fixing the ship. Luckily we had been given an alien bottle opener earlier, and surprisingly this somehow helped repairing things. Do not ask.</p><p>And then, in the final cycles of day 16 we managed to reach one last planet, one last hope to find the missing piece of the starmap. We decided that we could not go any further, as we did not have the means to keep us healed and patched together. In an unequaled team effort we steered the vessel towards the planet, fueled by alien oil instead of fuel - both fuel tanks were broken and we did not have the means to fix even one of them. The planet was a disappointment though. We even lost Chun, but thankfully she waved the white flag in the midst of the snow storm, which was a brilliant move. After an hour of running after us she finally caught up and we were reunited. No map, but we all survived. Jin Su plotted us a course to Sol and we returned, not only proud but also with the knowledge how to cure mankind from the mush infection and one living proof that it worked. at day 17, cycle 2, we entered a stable orbit and went on forth to free humankind.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">-</span></p><p>Thanks to, in no particular order (You all were such great people! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico">),</p><p>- Jin Su for being the best captain I can ever imagine - every ship should have one like you!<br>- Ian for his patience, understanding, not touching and his love for plants - which we ate.<br>- Chun for safeguarding our treasures - and our lifes - being helpful all the way.<br>- Frieda, both for being a patient mush and an active member of the crew after being cured.<br>- Roland, the shooting star of shooters - doing a wonderful job keeping them hunters away.<br>- Kuan Ti for his allrounder talents and not killing me.<br>- Paola, the overexcited commas manager for being awesome at your job.<br>- Hua, for helping out with the hunters - until we left you behind.<br>- Chao, for what you did. I am sorry you had to go so early.<br>- Terrence, master of drones, for actually trying and being helpful.<br>- Janice - for trying to be a mush and scaring the hell out of me.</p><p>Gioele,Finola and Eleesha not so much. I guess the cryosleep did not do you well.</p><p>Stephen... no words for you.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">-</span></p><p><strong>No touching!</strong></p>

                <p>Chun here. Not much I can add to your rundown of events. It threw me a little early on with your RPing (as I haven't had many do that on previous runs), but it certainly led to some very interesting reading between yourself and other crew members.</p><p>Stephen never spoke up to defend his actions, was sad to lose Chao in the attempt to rectify the problem.</p><p>Finola was lucky. I had told Chao to kill her, but then she finally spoke, so I rescinded the order till a consensus could be reached, cooler heads prevailed and her execution was stayed. Our situation towards the end wouldn't have been so touch and go had she concentrated on just healing like asked, but I guess she thought other things were more important.</p><p>Leaving Hua was a definite blow to the ship, but eating a couple of roids at the time wasn't a very appetizing thought.</p><p>Losing Paola and Terrence in your aforementioned manners were also hard blows, as losing any active and helpful member always is.</p><p>In the end we were stretched thin trying to keep the ship in one piece, keep each other from dropping dead (no thanks to the ship), and organizing explorations. With the long RL work hours I was putting in towards the end, I fully expected to come home and find myself dead, but you guys were amazing at keeping it together. And that's the moral of the story kids, with just a handful of active members you can accomplish great things.</p><p>Was a pleasure flying with you all, hope to see you down the road sometime.</p>
