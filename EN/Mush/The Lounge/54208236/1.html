                <p>Alpha Mush Finola here. I'm sure there's at least a few of you wondering: "What in the heck was she thinking?" <br> <br>Well frankly, when I got picked mush I had actually just woken up, when I stole my mush sample, it didn't occur to me to just <em>hide it</em> and not pick it up. I did an had to deface the room to cause the maximum amount of doubt and chaos possible. And from there that became my goal. Roland was the other alpha, I had caused enough confusion and doubt to get you guys to kill Terrence first, and Roland was giving me live updates as I fed into as much doubt as I could possibly generate. The longer I could delay the research, the better off Roland would be.</p><p>So yeah, basically from the start once I was Finola and I saw that mush alert, I knew I was effectively dead. But I needed to cause as much of a delay and confusion as I could. I think I did that very well. I see Roland managed to convert Eleeshan and reconvert Finola somehow. I also see the humans seemed a bit...scattered with their shootings and murderings. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Base plan was to take out the techs essentially, not a hard task seeing as we managed to get you guys to kill one, even if Stephen apprenticed him and I managed to stall long enough to steal one away....although I revealed the magebook I had hidden wit the mush sample, <strong>then forgot to read it or grab it before I left the room.</strong> I'm sure Stephen found it immediately.</p><p>I'd really like to know what else happened/what Roland did, because he did far better than I expected honestly. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> I didn't actually expect any more converts as much as I did transfers and murders.</p>

                <p>Hi guys. So I'll explain everything after hua's/terrence's death.</p><p>I had until d4 to extract spores freely. At this day, the constipaspore was done and extracting correctly without letting the hunters destroy us, as the only pilot of the ship, was pretty tough and it obviously became impossible after the appearance of the trax and arax, even though I had the daily mission thanks to this status of mankind's only pilot.</p><p>Anyway, I was basically trapping everything I could reach and was giving hints to Eleesha (since she had a starting spore). I remember a post-it in the rear corridor, gloves from the bravo bay. I was really afraid of the list in fact : I was part of the mush hunt channel so I thought I was safe from it, but if the list were to be printed, I would be killed for sure.</p><p>I also brought bandages to Finola with a little present for her : a spore. I wanted both Eleesha and Finola converted since they were the most annoying one with their skills. Lucky me, after an expedition I ended up hurt but nothing gave me any disease. I just asked Finola to get the Medikit from the trapped Alpha Bay 2 and to heal me.</p><p>To get back to the story, Eleesha was finally converted around midnight. Unfortunately, Janice was connected and told everyone. I didn't want to get along since I had a plan so I tried to buy some time to Eleesha. After le begging time, I managed to let Eleesha survive. She unfortunately didn't reconnect so the whole plan (infecting Finola one spore each and beating some cook's butt in 3v1) was a failure.</p><p>Since we didn't get the list, we had to look at the mush hunt channel and either kill the one who weren't on it or rfs them. That's what the humans did, and it appeared none of the 3 suspects were Mush. At this very moment, the game took a really good turn. Meanwhile, our O² was started missing and our hull needed some repairs.</p><p>Fortunately, the mush hunt thread started splitting : I was lucky enough to join a thread without Janice. Everyone was lost and doubts started overflowing : we reviewed who had a real reason to be in the thread : diseases, ate twice, victim of a transfert, and me, thanks to one single joke I said previously in the mush hunt thread, about a supervitamin bar I ate that beacame a supervitamin shit pending on my butt. Anyway, we reached a conclusion (after the really funny Frieda's death I must say) : Janice had no real excuse, just good work, but no biological reason to be here. And this would be the reason why she wanted to kill Eleesha so quicly : so she can't print the list.</p><p>Of course this was all wrong, she was a human. And then the humans were done. We were on a life-threatening situation : we still needed that o² and the hull was about to be lost. I thought it would be a good time to rush Finola, so I spiked her twice before and after midnight. I didn't hide it at all and went to the bridge stealing the logistics paola's bed. I thought I could stack at least 9 :pa: to infect stephen so finola could transfert into him and take out one of our two technicians.</p><p>Little did I know, Chao was an early bird and started beating the living mush out of me. Kuan Ti ended the work in the Medlab. (damn and I was asking for one weapon since Eleesha's infection to kill her, but nobody liked giving me dangerous items <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">). The humans also did another good thing : they activated the plasma shield they got thanks to neron's update (stupid microwave, can't ruin paola's job before she does her update <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> ).</p><p>I'm pretty sad to be honest to have died so early : the game was about to get really interesting with this sudden comeback from the humans. But it looks like Finola did a great job after her old pal died. I'm <strong>dying</strong> to hear her story.</p>
