D1C8. We did some recon. Paola and Frieda had spores from start. Strong but semi-active research team. 3 pilots but not very lucky with hunters. Only 1 tech. Chao with torturer skill.<br>On my previous 2 ships mushes were revealed by torturer so I warned Gio to not make any suspicious moves and to wait for opportunity for a good attack. We waited.</p><p>D3<br>I worked as commander, moved ship, sent missions, I found and brought mush sample to lab at the same cycle we had it. I went down to the planet, was lucky enough to not get ill. Team started to trust me. Gio did almost nothing for humans, a couple of relays and loading fuel (excuse for extracting spore because it was too boring for him to do nothing) and this is why Chao tortured him and revealed the fact of extracting spores. This is how action started.</p><p>We had Frieda in Icarus bay. She was inactive and last words from her was about her illness she got on the planet. Nobody tried to heal her and to know if she is human. She just stood in Icarus with one start spore on her.<br>Chao shouted in main channel about Gio and started to kill him. I told Gio to go and transfer but to close all tabs first. <br>I was on the bridge, I saw in mush channel Gio put second spore to Frieda, after this I saw Gio came here and Paola went away. <br>- What are you doing here, buddy, go and hide under Ian, - I asked in private channel and after it I realized Gio has no any skill. Transfer. And he did not close tab<img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"><br>No time to lose, I am sure he swaped bodies with Frieda may be and she just came here to warn everyone (he probably hid Walkie-Talkie) and only seconds before Frieda in Gio's body will shout. And Paola, she must be afraid and went for a weapon and ration. I started to kill. It was easy, Chao did almost all work before. Gio is dead. I reported in main channel he was not mush.<br>- Must be transfer, - said Chao, - and it must be you, Jin Su.<br>- No, - I said, - I never left bridge and I saw Paola run away. <br>And this is when I realized it was really Paola who is mush now. All clear now. I just made my parthner suspect number one. Oh, how I was mad about all this situation.<br>Paola-mush invited me into private channel and told she had no time to think clear. I told everything I think about mushes who don't close tabs before transfer, especially <strong>after he was told to close it</strong>. She said she was sorry, it was just panic. Well, it's ok for now, - I said, - let's see. what will they do<br>Paola knew she has not much time to live so she started to cause as much damage as she could. She used astro book she found. She removed camera in AD. She hid under Ian. And more. She warned me when she had 1hp left. Go and kill me. This is when I came. One hit and alpha Paola is dead. Mushperium will remember your sacriface. I killed mush.</p><p>I saw many people who think mush can't kill or do any damage to another mush. Have no idea why. There is nothing about it in SDF-rules. But the fact - people think you are human if you kill mush. Now humans trust me. For a while. I need another parthner or more trust of humans.</p><p>My second plan was to wait Frieda on the bridge and convert her there. People come to bridge not very often and usually they don't notice if someone removed camera. No red logs - everything is ok. And the fact they didn't notice removed camera in AD confirms it. So my plan was to remove camera on the bridge, spike Frieda, return camera.<br>But Frieda was still inactive. May be starving. Humans had not much suspects left. Risk is high. So this time it was my turn to start doing mushy things.<br>I came to Icarus, put third spore to Frieda (thanx for setup, Gio), took anonymush, did 1 shot and reported Chao and Roland in mush hunt channel why I think she is mush. - She told she was ill and illness consume health and she is still alive. And she was not proven. Ok, - they said and killed Frieda. Easy swallowed my bait. 2 mushes dead. Jin Su, you were right! All green on crew tab. We are mush free (no Eleesha to confirm). Low morale, low hull, low oxygen level but we can do it! Let's survive.</p><p>D4<br>I hoped to get to Sol with crew but at the next day I calculated my chances. Humans still had no Paola's list and it could show Frieda was not alpha. I was low in health and could be killed by any steel plate. They could notice I never ate and I couldn't hide ap from rations. So I just waited until 4 of them went down to the planet to fill our oxygen tanks and well, I moved the ship<img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>4 deaths. 4 morale swiped away. Angry humans came and killed me. So it was the end. Last 3 of them committed suicide same cycle ater they killed me because they had zero morale. And only cat left on board. But it had spore on it too. I put one on it before my death. Just in case.</p>
