There were hunters and they had already dealt some damage. That must have knocked me in the cryochamber and I broke my finger. However, Andie was peacefully asleep on medlab bed. I send a message and next cycle, the bed is relinquished and I perform surgery. Not an easy task but I succeed. My finger is good as new although it was a messy/dirty operation. I run to the refectory to grab coffee and a ration to go out into the fresh air of space. Those hunters were destroyed.</p><p>I send Andie another message as there are fruits in the refectory. I manage to drop a hydropot in the corridor. One of the fruit was accidentally eaten, but the other was planted.</p><p><strong>Day 2 </strong>saw another wave of hunters but I am still the only pilot and am in no fit state to take many out. Stephen, a new player runs round the turrets and is able to damage some. I then shoot more but only partially damage. A couple of cycles later, I am still the only pilot and ask for a cooked ration. Stephen is quick and delivers. I then shoot all but one which was turreted.</p><p>Chun is awake but unreachable.</p><p>I had posted a message suggesting to delay in the installation of cameras until at least 12 people had awoken.</p><p><strong>Day 3 </strong>sees me start at 4 morale. I go in search of fruit but find none. The plants had not been looked after. Not everyone is awake yet. I send the main channel a message for hugs from Janice when she awakes. She does deliver so I am a lot happier. I go and do a scrap run.</p><p>I was offline when yet another wave of hunters appeared. Then, the final crew member woke up - Jin Su. He flew out and destroyed the hunters but stayed out in space. D3C8.<br><strong><br>Day 4.</strong></p><p>The first cycle, there were yet more hunters. I grab the coffee and down it in front of Stephen. Then I head to the lab for a banana as I needed morale leaving a bright red log there too. Still quite low and it would only be a matter of time before Chun starved. I ate a ration while in space.</p><p>The planet is a decent one with oxygen. We should explore it. Frieda reports that she has loaded fuel - only 1, and was dirty. However, Hua and Janice (diplomat) await in Icarus Bay. I collected more scrap and saw Jin Su still out in space C6. I send Hua and Janice a message saying about the commander. Jin Su landed later but returned to the bridge. I thought there was no point in waiting for the commander. I picked up the compass from Bravo Bay where I spotted Frieda dirty. I then unload the fuel and take it with me on the expo. Jin Su had walked through Icarus bay while Hua and Janice were waiting.</p><p>Terrence was returning to the game after a long hiatus so I sent him a message with a few details to get him up to speed again on the game. I let him know what I was doing and suggest he keep an eye on the fuel gauge. I also note Frieda had been dirty for a third time. I let him know the progress of the expedition. Hua is worried about dying on the planet. Insects gave us a steak x 2, and Janice gets an illness. We get 8 oxygen (better than 0). Nothing else to report other than one fatigue. <br>I am out of ap when we head back otherwise I would have healed Janice. I was going to suggest in the main channel that she be healed. However, as I was about to depart for the engine room, I feel a change in me. I am now mush. I loaded the fuel, and the sneaky one had taken anonymush. I discover I had picked up spores from 2 traps - guessing Bravo Bay where the compass was, and in ER when I had taken the fuel. I looked at the mush skills I could take but was lucky not to pick anonymush (I've seen before the alpha mush and the newly converted take anonymush at the same time). I got dirty loading fuel. The fun then begins in the mush channel.</p><p>CS had been completed and all the spores had been taken for the day. I then chose fertile and mycelium spirit so I could extract on the way to bed.</p><p>Gioele, who was a caffeine addict and astro, pushed to get Janice healed. Janice replied that she was at full health (I knew that was a lie from the expo in progress screen, but I thought Hua would have picked up on that too). We get into a debate about mush tests. Anyway, Janice never got healed that cycle and miraculously, the "migraine" healed itself.</p><p>The connection to sol was made early in the day. However, it was also the day the shower got dismantled and he got dirty.. Terrence had inadvertently picked up the camera but hadn't gotten round to installing it for a few cycles.. Paola was in Bravo Dorm to seek the safely of a cameraed room. The sofa gets built this day too.</p><p>Others who have visited Bravo Dorm: Frieda (she had a bed, and appeared to be relaying projects), Hua, myself, Janice. Gioele. Ian brought the soap.</p><p><strong>Day 5</strong>, I behave as human as I can. Terrence is asking questions. I still have to tell the truth but maybe not the whole truth so help me RNG. Terrence had asked, "What is your policy on killing Mush? How much evidence do you need?"</p><p>I replied with:<br>Some ships act on little evidence - getting dirty for example, holding apron for a little bit longer, forgetting apron. Genuine mistakes even. Anything that doesn't quite add up. However, I like to have more certainty just to be sure as newbies do look like mush. Exceptions - Commander and Communications officer. You can move the ship (if lucky) with a hacker kit, but no one else other than the comms officer can do comms work unless it is over their dead body (and the title moves on at cycle change).</p><p>There was a question over the astropad. It looked like the wrong one was being used. This let me also use the excuse with Terrence that Frieda was having problems with astropad.</p><p>Jin Su had passed through medlab. With the fuel loaded, Jin Su moved the ship but this was after the day 5 signal started to transmit. +6 morale not forthcoming. I started to worry about Janice's morale if she were human. Raluca had taken the cat with her after NCC had been completed. However, she brought the cat back to AD. Janice hugs the cat putting a spore on the feline.</p><p>Two dots moved through AB and CC together. I worried they'd be going after Frieda but in fact, they were relaying mycoalarms and finished them. Terrence updated astropad in medlab but Gioele returned to AD.</p><p>We were planning who to convert. We wanted Terrence but thought Gioele would be the better bet as he would likely be online first. I thought Terrence was in a time zone far far away and would be asleep as it was the middle of the night. With Frieda looking so obvious, we hoped she'd be able to take down the AD camera, but due to offline issues, she wasn't around. I took defacer. Janice and I bought had infector. Gioele was converted at the end of day 5.</p><p><strong>Day 6</strong>. We think we must get Terrence onboard. I pondered about the mycoalarms but, hey, no one mentioned the defacer in AD. Stephen and Kuan Ti had been active and relaying projects.</p><p>Ian was being vocal about Paola. Said she was mush. Paola had decoded the day 4 base. We had a Polyvalent Andie and a Diplomat in Janice. No Xyloph. No Neron upgrade. In her defence, the sofa was late build and a camera was late to be installed.Ian attacked Paola, and Paola attacked back. I decided to weigh in, this would take me through medlab and spike Terrence. I only had the one spore available. I also had a blaster with 2 shooter points. No BBBRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNGGGGG!!!! On the bridge, I consider carefully who to shoot. I chose to shoot Paola. Not much damage so I head back to dorms. I think it was Frieda and Janice who added the final two spores to convert Terrence.</p><p>Ian kills Paola. Jin Su wandered into BD, didn't say a word. So, we kill him. Who else to convert?</p><p><strong>Day 7</strong>. We convert Raluca. Janice had visited her turret a couple of days ago but gave hugs. This time, she spiked once. Terrence didn't have the xp to transfer and then take tech on top of phys to complete Pilgred. I finished her off.</p><p>Pilgred hadn't been started but they got it up to 35% while I slept..</p><p>I awake after sleep to discover huge amount of hunters. Wave of 20. I do what I can and take that down to 16. Gioele moves the ship but we still lost hull - now at 40 with 12 hunters outside. C8 sees the hull drop to 13. Plasma Shield is the project in the nexus. Janice and Terrence finish it off and it buys us some time. Hua had gone semi-inactive but managed to get 4 of the hunters.</p><p><strong>Day 8</strong>. Well, first cycle, we have 5 oxygen. Not a lot. The plasma shield won't hold for long and Pilgred is still a long way off. Not many humans left. Stephen managed to get Brainsync decoded. We thought we'd convert him. Gioele and Janice see to that. Hua is converted by Terrence and myself (under camera and mycoalarm). Kuan Ti is assassinated.</p><p>Only mush alive, although one is still green in the bar. No mush died in the making of this ship.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/10331">The End</a></p>

I was happy to have been selected Alpha Mush. Frieda was my partner and she was active so that made it even better.</p><p>Our first victim was Roland. Frieda had spiked the ER and some other place at the back of the ship after she loaded 1 fuel. We'd been all waiting for Jin to come join the expo but he didn't come. So Roland removed the 1 fuel and came to launch. Lucky for us, he grabbed the 2 spores Frieda used earlier. Unfortunately the planet had 3 zones that could give us illnesses. To make matters worse, I was the one who got the illness <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> It was Smallpox too. But of course, I quickly claimed I got a Migraine.</p><p>Of course, once the expedition finished, I was quick to bring Roland on our side, before he could leave IB. At the same time, we posted the expo result link and I announced my "migraine". That triggered Gioele's paranoia or something because he was really insisting on me getting checked with the Medkit. I swiftly protested claiming I was at full HP and that purposely healing something as minor as a Migraine is pretty much a Mush test. Some people seemed to agree, others didn't. My refusal made Gioele and Stephen suspect me but the matter was dropped as soon as the cycle changed and my Migraine miraculously healed.</p><p>In any case, research was making progress, in spite of Chun's death of starvation and of our lack of comms work. Roland, Frieda and I decided botth Gioele and Terrence were our biggest threat as Terrence kept actively trying to find us and Gioele kept pushing research. When the Mycoalarms were finally done, we knew we had to act and get either Terry or Gioele on our side to be able toobtain the location of those pesky things.</p><p>Our initial target was Terry but he managed to slip through our fingers as he moved to the front of the ship and Gioele took his place in A Dorm. Roland and I had to resort to defacing A dorm at the end of the day to do it. Lucky for us, the defacer went completely unreported and possibly unnoticed. Once we got Gioele, we started planning Terry's conversion. He was in the medlab and, according to Gioele, he was unprotected.</p><p>Ian gave us the perfect chance to act as he started accusing Paola of being Mush and the two started attacking eachother. So Roland, Frieda and I converted Terry and now there were 4 mushes on the bar since I had taken Anonymush when I converted Roland.</p><p>After we got Terry, we spent a lot of time planning and coming up with ideas and strategies. We brought Raluca on our side the following day and we were gonna go for a PILGRED repair and Sol return and we even got PILGRED a little over halfway done. By then, Ian had died by lack of Morale, Andie got demoralized to death and Jin Su was disposed of on "suspicion of being Mush". But our only pilot was Roland and he was Mush. Sure, we had Hua but she was inactive most of the time. We had to resort to finishing Plasma Shield in order to gain enough time to convert Stephen on D8C1.</p><p>After Stephen's conversion, Roland and Terry converted Hua as well and I knifed Kuan Ti to death leaving us with a ship full of Mush. Roland and I even tried for a Mush baby but it just wasn't meant to be <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As I said before, this ship has been awesome for me. Roland, Terry and acted like a command center since we were the most active and the others followed our lead. Props to Terry for staying up until 4-5 am on occasions just for the cause.</p>

It wasn't the greatest in terms of coordination and activity, and I had trouble with timezone differences, but the few people that were active and chatty made it an enjoyable ride.

Somehow, I always come across someone like this on each ship, and really, you are the people that keep the game alive.

To be fair, I've been playing consistently for a year and I was only ever close to regular, human Eden twice but never got there in the end. You'd have to get REALLY lucky for a Mush Eden. Slip under the radar if you plan to infiltrate n a human crew doing it or have a very active crew and very active and resourceful Mushes to get the whole crew converted and keep Ian alive to prevent NERON blowing up the ship.</p>
