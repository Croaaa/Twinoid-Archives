                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3761">Game End Scoreboard</a></p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> here. All sorts of weirdness happened on that ship; somebody hid the Soap in Front Storage before the game even began (which is against the <a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Neutral_Play">Neutral Play</a> rules), which led to Chao's undeserved death since he was the only person to visit the Storage post-Mush.</p><p>After that, we've had a Hua suddenly snap and rampage through the ship. She didn't manage to kill anybody, but she did convert our Roland as well confuse the living hell out of me by vomiting all over the place during the fights. This led me to believe that she couldn't have been alpha - after all, Mush cannot contract diseases - but it turns out she was, since she got herself a <strong>Disfunctional Liver</strong> by throwing a grenade, which is an injury which also causes Vomiting. Urgh!</p><p>Basically, my investigations ended up being a really embarassing farce, because Chao was human and Hua was alpha, entirely against my assumptions. When I printed THE List and it had two names on it, Ian and Hua, I was sure of my final victory against the Mush. After all, I "knew" Hua wasn't alpha, and THE List only prints Alpha Mush, right? So, clearly Ian must've been the last alpha! How wrong I was, and how wasted the Retro-Fungal Serum was.</p><p>Sigh. At the end our ship exploded from hull disrepair and everybody burned to death. Oh well! At least I had all rebel bases and Xyloph DB slots unlocked (since our Paola Mush was inactive and I took over her job).</p><p>In the end I regret nothing, though, since the ship had nice and fun people on it, and it was interesting to know that I can be outplayed and out-mindgamed by griefers as well as <em>the game itself</em>, rather than the Mush themselves.</p><p><strong>PS:</strong> I reported the Soap incident, so whoever hid the soap before the game started, and therefore completely screwed up my detective work, can look forward to sanctions.

                <p>I was Janice.</p><p>In the end, this is a ship we'll remember Ivi. I was completely thrown out of role play early on due to almost killing you and for cycles on I wish you had died to clear you from suspicion! I followed Chun's orders though and restrained myself. My Janices are usually serene, would rather never hurt a fly.... Right. In the end I blamed it on being in love with Stephen! (You didn't know Stephen, I only realized after you died - human!).</p><p>At one time or another I suspected almost every one else on this ship, and I bought into Eleesha's "find" that Hua must have been beta I also saw the vomitting). Hua! I bet you could never believe what drama came from throwing that grenade! Suspects everywhere! Two things I never told Hua: 1) Terrence told me he was down to ONE health before escaping from you. 2) I didn't see the three mush on the list, and I doubt anyone else would have either if you had taken anomush as you planned. Something you said, and eventually Terrence PMing me about the possibility of a third mush (I was like "NAAH, Hua planned to spike someone twice, don't worry she didn't get to do it" once after day break - everything happened five minutes to day break and onwards - I am always an optimist!) made me actually look on the little men at the top, and we had three mush!! Damn those eager project relayers? Or was it Roland's patroller that got him? Also, did you have splashproof early on or not? As I said I did suspect you for staying in bed a little too much, but then you seemed to do the right things when you didn't, but then you had lost health right after getting yourself cleaned up. So I kept my eyes on you. And there was no excuse for walking into the Alpha Dorm without any free beds, seemingly straight from BD. Refresh page saved the day and you got interrupted! Yes! Having the cool to use up your tech points and the luck to disassembling the drill in Icarus for when you got the grenade showed your true evil!</p><p>Throughout the game I felt I was running catch up to make up for almost assassinating you Ivi (well once it was established you were human!). However, I was SO frustrated with you for using the serum without consulting anyone. Just because one mush is identified doesn't mean you want him cured! I believed Roland was beta at the time and felt he was most important to save as the only pilot. Even if it had been Gioele he was an active commander and it should have been discussed.</p><p>We had luck with the Xyloph list too, although it came late it threw out my idea that Gioele was the missing Alpha. Not taking caffeine addict is convenient for mush and although active, he didn't communicate much. I was pretty sure we didnt have a mush Tech on the ship because nothing was happening to Pilgred. Gioele checking it and projects a lot without saying anything kept me from trusting him.</p><p>I learnt a lot on this ship. The final was that Roland got "sick" on expedition and I thought that meant he wasn't mush after all (leaving Gioele as the main suspect beta mush, so relieved to have a human pilot!). Turned out of course that mush can seemingly get "sick" and not have it actually catch on. Having AP for standby healing straight after expedition would be the only way to guarantee it.</p><p>Kuan, I never knew what you used your AP from, except that one time when you and Terrence saved the ship from five hull. I should have been trusted human then, I used up so much AP to get it repaired twice just before we got down to five. Frieda you should have talked more, there was no indication either way if you were mush or not. Finola, you did your research but rarely said a thing, kept the medlab bed empty and research was delayed. At least until I spoke about using it. Raluca, you did great, why did you go?! I was frustrated at theories by all crew were not thrown in all through the investigation (I often felt I was talking to myself, everyone else keeping their own counsel/not participating - ah the mistrust!).</p><p>With better AP control we had so many pilots and techs we should have reached SOL. If it wasn't for Hua! Ah, well, drama also well remembered.</p><p>Janice out. <img src="http://twinoid.com/img/icons/mush/janice_kent.png" alt=":tid_mush_tease_JK:" class="tid_ico"></p>
