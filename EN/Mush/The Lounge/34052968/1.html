No idea why...</p><p>I was Raluca on this ship and I was suprised to find out Eleesha was a mush... after she showed me the light. Granted I had been the one pushing for testing and checking... and then remained dirty from more or less day 2 until the end of the ship...</p><p>My first action, Convert my baby to the side of the mush. MushCat forever!</p><p>I missed my big chance to convert both Janice and roland, who both had 1 spore each around dayroll but with Hua in the room... I chickened out...</p><p>Stephen went nuts, cooked all rations before dayroll, and ended it litterally just before we went to convert him...</p><p>Chao... you just need to learn a few things, in that just acting on suspisions is not enough... I was human when I got you to kill the human Kuan Ti.... a action as a mush I laugh on now.</p><p>All in all, Great ship other then the idlers and people NOT *banana* talking as much as they should have been.</p>

                <p>I was Jin Su on the same ship. In the end, somehow I suspected you as the last mush, but there was no proof other than your eagerness to get rid of Roland. I think he was determined to go after the most inactive ones one by by one and Ian hand't talked too much was hoarding the armor. Still, thanks for filling the fuels as asked <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Didn't really suspect Eleesha at all, should've, nothing she did worked very well. I wonder how Roland figured her out. Stephen going nuts was the highlight, 30 mins rush to try to save the foods, which wouldn't have worked even if he hadn't taken the hacker kit. Thanks for the good game.</p>

                <p>Actully, near the end there, Im more worried about greefing... Even if I had not been the mush, I still would have commented about how he was starting to play against team, just killing idles as he was was pointless. infact....</p><p>If you do the math, it takes 3 days from joining a ship to start staving, assuming your not totally new, then 2 days to die from health lost from starving(you get a few back from day change). That alone means human idlers will die by day 6 at least, and you can start checking them when they hit 3 days idle for damage assuming that damage has not hit the room, and you can keep checking, the moment they come back from a cycle change without having health damage they are mush and then you can kill them.</p><p>But to be killing people randomly, that is playing against team, and they need to be reported for, Which I did report him for playing against the humans.<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Having been on a few ships before, I have to say the worst way to go is to be active, and randomly killed. For that Kuan Ti, I am sorry for getting you killed, but you were not talking about what you were doing.</p>
