Since Finola was "cured" and said there were no more mush. And yet, four living mush on the end screen. The curing bit... might have been a bit exaggerated. &gt;.&gt; <br>Or maybe even completely fabricated. &lt;.&lt;</p><p>The explanation: Alpha mush Finola and Ian, converted inactive Janice early to throw off suspicion. Then they got Chao. Finally on the last day, they got me (Raluca). I couldn't believe it when I woke up mush then, upon examination of room logs, realized Ian had removed the mycoalarm from my room previously and neither I nor any of the several people who had been through since had noticed. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Too much to keep track of on this ship on my own. :/ So I then geniused the mush cure serum to use on Finola, as had been planned when human... Only I used it on Chun and only claimed to have used it on Finola, taking anonymush myself at the same time. Finola handily agreed that she'd been cured and was now human, and that she'd been alpha with Janice partner, and unable to convert anyone.</p><p>Hua, I thought, for sure, would call bullshit on this. After all, we'd had 0 mush on the bar, then a new one just a bit earlier, and she'd noticed it. Frieda seemed pretty sharp too. I held my breath and waited for one of them to call me out... but I was the leader, and I'd just geniused the cure, why would I lie?</p><p>Why indeed... <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>For the record, mush cannot become unanonymous once they've taken the skill. There was no other explanation for that new mush on the bar than a new mush, so Finola couldn't have been the only one. That human bit of my mind wanted to yell this, to flail about and declare that logic dictated we had at least 3 mush at that point, possibly more... but.... well. That human part was so very small when I awoke this morning.</p><p>So our mush played pretty well. However, they also didn't have much in the way of opposition. I really felt like I was the only one doing any mush hunting, and the amount Raluca can do is rather limited. That being said, the main killer of this ship was hunter attacks. Jin Su logged in once a day for a cycle or two, which inevitably led to him not being there when we needed to move the ship. Roland went mostly inactive, leaving only Hua to pilot. She did her best but... well... And the hacker kit was nowhere to be found. None of the humans I spoke with knew where it was, and after I was converted, found out the mush hadn't hidden/hoarded it either. If we'd have had any mush hunters, perhaps they'd have seen where it went early on, but alas... a mystery it will remain.</p><p>Diary: <a href="http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/ship/v/3150" target="_blank">http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/ship/v/3150</a></p>

                <p>I was Ian. Did anyone suspect me of mush before we ended? I let a plant die, sure, but I needed ap for sporing and stuff so I stayed in the dorms. I realize now that my strategy here WOULD NOT work on MMJ ships. Ian picking up mycoalarms x2 (chao in the RC then you in the medlab.) I was surprised you didn't call me out for either one. It was easy as without early mycoalarms, we got Janice then Chao. Raluca fell next and then we could have gotten one more person at least before the ship died completely. Gioele killed stephen and I still don't know why. That only helped the mush side even though he wasn't on our side LOL. I have to say though that mush Ian and Finola was hard. Both of us shouldn't be able to leave the lab without being called on, which we weren't :l. Raluca all alone in the medlab even with a mycoalarm is dangerous, Chao standing in the RC alone, easy prey. Janice was inactive so we slowly got her, kinda took long as I usually never play mush. Btw, humans had more honor at the end though <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Some more is explained in my journal link in the first post, if you care to read it, the last entry kind of summarizes what happened and whatnot. ^^</p><p>Heh, I suspected you a little bit since early on, never knew where your AP was going... but other people were also doing random things, so not too strongly until you moved the mycoalarm away from Chao to protect yourself somewhere you shouldn't have even been. Plan was to cure Finola, which took much longer than I though it would given I was just waiting to genius it... but varying factors such as Chun wandering out of the lab right when we got the genome disk then going offline for another day... &gt;.&lt; If she hadn't have done that, I think this ship would have been a human win. Plan was, cure Finola, ask her who other mush were.... on the off chance was somehow wrong about Finola, take care of Jin Su myself, ask Chao to kill you before we went back to Sol, with his shooter points. Flaw in that plan, of course, was that he was also mush by the end. ^^;</p><p>Chao is the one I never figured out, because I assumed he'd kill a couple of people very quickly if he became mush, starting with myself and Hua. Would have ended the ship very swiftly that way. Turns out was a faulty assumption though. When he was converted, and you both took anonymush, it was pretty clear he was the only one other than myself who was active to be converted around that time. I joked with him in private that if he had been converted, I'd be offended if he didn't come after me. Heh. When he didn't, I figured mush took anon because could, to see about causing paranoia against one of us or something. ^^;</p>

                <p>Yeah....ya know, I had a feeling something was funny when I was standing at the Command Console, my hand moving back and forth over the "Return to Sol" or "Advance" buttons. Seeing the rest of the story now, if I had gone to the planet, you mush-all would have converted me or had Chao kill me, or oxygen would have run out...clear mush victory no matter what. Nonetheless, the ever changing nefarious plans of Raluca for the human or mush team, played out and she masterminded a stunning return to Sol on the mush team in the end. Well played Mush! Especially Finola...it's hard to be mush Finola!</p><p>I did see that Ian had moved a mycoalarm....but it seemed too late to do anything about it with the oxygen so low, so many hunters and asteroids. He seemed fishy letting that plant die.</p><p>Finola had to be mush, and I have seen the cure work, so that could be true. Honestly, it was always worrisome to have Raluca laying in Medlab even with mycoalarm.</p><p>And that damn mycoscanner, I mean really, without someone there looking at the logs, why believe what someone posts in chat that looks like they're spore free?</p><p>Chao, he seemed faithful for a while, then flaky. Who knows, I thought, maybe he's got a thesis or a math exam?</p><p>But yes, Frieda, I did put my thesis first. The deadline was approaching fast and somehow I was on a long running ship that had a small but active, vocal crew and no hacker to be found!! I think you mush all had an advantage with Eleesha not really mush hunting, at least as far as I could tell. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hua reporting here.</p><p>My inexperience decided the game, that was just my third ship and 2 previously ended on day 3, so.. i know now i shouldve checked if Raluca really applied cure, but tbh, im just learning game mechanics and dont know which actions are public and which secret, etc.. <br>The other thing is that i said there were mush in bar, then isnt and there is was again - i knew that there must have been new mush and pointed that out, tho noone said anything about that so i thought that its somehow possible (transfers, repick skills etc) - again, my inexperience in game mechanics.. In the end, again, i shouldve verify the curing..<br>I think we were too blind with the list that there must be one mush, so we didnt think about others except the list - otherwise Ian should be suspect no.1 as ive treated/watered plants at least 15 times, so he didnt do anything basically - i thought he is just inactive, but it was mushy thing..<br>Finola - excellent job, you played it very well!<br>Raluca - thanks for all those advices and chat, it was nice and really helpful!<br>Gioele - the most useless player, i dont get why did he kill Stephen and not saying anything..<br>-why was Stephen so rude? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>In the end, i really enjoyed this ride, it was so intense, i was contantly sleeping, eating a lot and i was still short on APs for killing hunters.. and ive treated plants a lot meanwhile.. Sorry that i wasnt much hunting and paying for attention for that thing, but im noob and learning mechanics first :/</p><p>The only things that irritates me a lot are points.. this game need some serious rebalancing in points matter, cause i dont get it why alpha mush are so low in ranking even tho they did excellent job.. and i dont get why rolland - he was so inactive and not really helpfull.. <br>anyway, i enjoyed it and thank you all for this experience!</p>

                <p>Oh god, did not expect the ending, I though that it was gonna be all lovey dovey but there's the mush to sabotage things up <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Grandma Freida here btw <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>My last ship before this was a successful mush victory done by me as alpha mush (Frieda) as I murdered almost all of the crew by assassination and deppression, it was made into an AP thread here too. And I can attribute that success to the powerful excuse of "Sorry not doing job, mush flash is crashing so I have to be <strong>afk/away</strong>" And going into the ship, I reckon that that excuse would only be used by stupid and lazy people like me which is not the majority of the community. Imagine all the laugh I made, when I realized that I become a victim of this same tactic also, So KUDOS to the mush team! Though it was a tragic ending for human, it is nevertheless fitting for the mush team who clearly has the more desire to win here.</p><p>For the first few days until eleesha prints the list, my main suspect was really Ian and second is Terrence. Ian's drama of being inactive is quite obvious to be honest, especially when it was found out that you don't have the inactive status even though it seems that you're constantly n comma in bed. But it all dried out when Stephen rage at me for being to aggressive and accuses me of suspecting everyone else "without" basis.</p><p>Due to seemingly inactivity of the majority, it really comes to me as a surprise the fact that the mush has converted many people. You succeeded in making me believe that Janice was one of the alpha mush and my most conservative estimate of the total mush on board was 2. Also, i never suspected Finola as being the mush because the research seems to be on time. And that the last mush was either Roland and Jin Su.</p><p>Thanks again to the mush team for giving the voyage a memorable, epic and twisted ending. Cherish it guys, you so deserve it! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But even though if we have to put the ending aside, the voyage was still memorable and epic, thanks to the small group of active people trying to keep things interesting and sticks to the bitter end. I'm talking about us, <strong>Jin Su's angels</strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Oh Raluca, you sexy bitch you never did once show a slight inclination that you have fallen and was made into a seductive devil. I have this slight curiosity of those hearts sprouting from your body. It was not cupid's hearts, but tiny little pink mushrooms all along!</p><p>and a little bit of facepalm to Chun's wandering. If she has the slight sense of direction, Raluca would finish the cure before becoming a pink succubus.</p><p>and also to Eleesha, here's a little advice my dearie: "You're a detective for god's sake, you need to talk a lot!"</p><p>And to Geiole, what the fudge are you thinking, Mr. Billionaire? I though coffee only makes you drowzy, not stupid! Oh poor Stephen, he's is a minor offence, smoking weed. it's tolerable even in grade school.</p><p>To our little cute Paola. Good job my dear, you did contact all the rebel base including the day 1 <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> and like eleesha, please communicate in the future.</p><p>To Jin Su, the chinese lover boy with thesis problem. I forgot to tell you that your grandpa was my ex, deal with it son! The text screen cut my message. The full text was: <em>"...To bad captain's put his thesis first before our welfare, that's a joke. You're handsome, so is your grandpa <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">"</em></p><p>To Hua, you're braver than roland. Keep eating in space but don't get dirty <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> You're more trustworthy than any Ian I met.</p><p>To Raluca, thanks for the leadership you showed girl! I learned a lot from you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Though we only manage day 6 and one planet exploration, I consider it a cinderella story so thank you all for making it happen.</p><p>A little sidenote, on the day our ship returned to sol I notice that we only have so little rations (about 4), I know we ate a lot but it can't be so little since we hoard so many alien steak in our expedition, what happened? Anyone knows? Or will it be lost to oblivion like our poor hacker kit? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
