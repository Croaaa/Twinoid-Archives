I also played horribly - RL and lag kept kicking my butt mid-play, and I spent more time idling next to beds and in hallways than I can ever recall doing in another game. Sorry guys.</p><p>Still, we made it to Eden, thanks entirely to the efforts of my crew-mates. Well done.</p><p>Thank you to Jin Su for giving me most of the missions. Having a bed + devoted... it was a heady mix. And I did enjoy your mission messages <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"><br>Janice, you did extremely well, and congratulations on your pregnancy. Perhaps I should have been more faithful, but there was also moral Emergencies.<br>Chun and Ian, thanks work working with me so well in the lab. You guys got things done very quickly.<br>Gioele, thanks for being a rock and finishing Pilgred.<br>KT - thanks for the fun times, and all the effort you put into planet scanning.<br>Frieda - thanks for failing to kill Chun.<br>Paola - You have the most interesting style of trying to have people help you. Also, I learned not to play with guns.<br>Roland &amp; Derek - thanks for being excellent pilots.<br>Hua - I'm sorry you died so quickly on this ship. We sorely missed you, especially at the end.<br>Eleesha - what happened?</p><p>I also found out that Andie can make people pregnant</p>
