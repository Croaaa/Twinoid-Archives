                <p>...nearly reached Eden!</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3885"></a><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3885" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3885</a></p><p><strong>Hello crew, this is Alpha-Mush-Commander Jin Su speaking. </strong><br>First to say it was an absolutely awesome ship, lasting till Day 17 and might have lasted even longer if I hadn't this accident on my mobile with hitting "Extracting Spore" instead of just scrolling up the page while Frieda was in the same room. Also a shame Random Number God didn't provide us with the last Starmap fragment on this last expedition after having nearly 5 days scanning without a single crystallite zone.</p><p>But let me tell you how we managed to trick you all and nearly reached Eden from the beginning.</p><p>When I woke up with my comrade Roland I already had this mission from the collective to seek out for this place called Eden. So it was clear from the first day that our goal would be to be a sneaky part of the team and reach this new hunting ground. <br>Luckily I was in contact with the lovely Paola right before cycle change and due to the lack of an active Chun we found ourselves starting the "Mush-Hunting-Channel". I offered to do a food test any time and expected from Paola to stay clean all the time. Of course the food test was never possible for lack of AP or inactivity or other things.</p><p><strong>Converting Raluca</strong><br>Roland and me made use of all 4 spores in day one, but had to eat some of them to cover our mushy actions. For we extracted several spores right after cycle change, doing secret showers we still had enough spores ready to turn our first victim. Raluca was obviously the best victim for she was mainly inactive and standing in Engine room the first time. We spored her twice in day 2 and Roland could easily give her the last shot in beginning of Day 3, immediately going Anonymush. So short, so easy. After being converted Raluca never said anything again and didn't even move.</p><p><strong>Getting rid of Eleesha</strong><br>This one was the most nasty thing I ever planned. We first thought that our Eleesha was quite unskilled and mainly inactive - but she wasn't as we had to learn soon. For I was very helpful and actively "fighting the mush-menace" she trusted me and contacted me about suspicious actions. I told her of course being part of the secret Mush-Hunt-Team what Derek could confirm (he was proved being human by eating twice at this time). So I had her trust when she told me that Roland was clean when going to shoot hunters and dirty after coming back. His excuse of "checking and loading fuel" couldn't stand of course, but luckily Eleesha had no contact to the Mush-Hunt-Team but to me.<br>I didn't tell the Team, just told some other quite unintersting stuff she reported to me and so the active hunting crew thought Eleesha wasn't very valueable - some were even convinced she was mush herself. But it was absolutely obvious that we had to get rid of her.<br>So I planned and prepared a situation suitable for our final strike into relative security: <br>In day 4 we were in the situation of having 1 spore both. Earlier this day I already told Ian to stay out of the dorms because there might be some Mush-killing-action and we didn't want to lose AP. Then I told the Mush-Hunt-Group of Eleeshas suspicions about Roland (a whole day later than she reported it to me). For it was no 100% evidence and our plan could only work on day change I proclaimed I would interrogate Roland before we kill him, trying to trick him into lies. Of course Roland wasn't online till 1 hour before day change and I could manage to prevent Derek from killing Roland just out of suspicion. I told Eleesha in C5 this day that she should save up AP for we would go after Roland in D5C3. Poor Eleesha.<br>After doing a faked interrogation where Roland told me a wrong morale value and I telling him that that's not possible - exactly 60 seconds before cycle change - Roland entered the Dorm in which Eleesha and me were, removed the camera, spored her once and transferred into her. I immediately spored Rolands old body once, went out of room and after day change produced a spore and re-entered dorm. Roland (now Eleesha) did the same and spored old Roland the second time. I gave him the last shot and took Anonymush myself. Then I cried for help in all channels that Roland was after me and fled from the dorm. Eleesha, helpful as she was, attacked Roland immediately and Derek was a bit pissed that Roland was already dead when he entered dorm.<br>(The whole action took 90 seconds and was the most adrenaline-pumping thing I ever did in mush).<br>So we had our first confirmed dead mush.</p><p><strong>Going into the shadows</strong><br>Now it got very easy for us. There was some distraction from my side about spores upon me etc. but in the end it was obious that Raluca was mush when she didn't starve to death at the end of Day 5. So Derek finished her - glad he could kill someone - and we had our second dead mush at beginning of day 6. Of course Eleesha now wasn't able to print the list and the whole crew could breath up. I guaranteed that Roland didn't transfer into Eleesha and pretended that we had a secret codeword for this case - as I had it with Paola.</p><p><strong>Boredom and Research</strong><br>The days were now something between boredom and pain - at least for me because I couldn't stop being the always caring, glorious commander. All without any AP from food. Our Research team did damn good and due to Constatispore-Serum it was also no longer possible to get a little AP from sporing and Phagocyte. Long story short - I wanted to go on with something suitable for my evil mastermind. I first though about turning Paola, but that would have been a very big cripple of our team for she was the one in the end who held the ship together, being always everywhere. I also got a bit afraid of the activities of our Lieutenant Graham for Pheromodem would doom us if we would spike any other person - what I actually wanted to do. Also I had the feeling it wouldn't be appreciated by the collective to let this Andie-thing research an Anti-Mush-Serum.<br>So the next victim was selected easily - and so was the plan. I had some private talks with most of the crew members and it was quite easy to convince the very devote Lieutenant to do some physical action without a camera. Eleesha spored her once when she was standing in Icarus Bay so it only 3 nice little events from my side were actually needed. I could convince her to do it the last time at a cycle where our hyper-active Paola ususally wasn't this active. So it was easy to get her take Anonymush in time without anyone noticing.</p><p><strong>The End</strong><br>The end is told very quickly: For nearly all of our AP was needed to heal crew members, seek out crystallite planets and doing morale speeches it was not possible to extract many spores at all. We really tried hard to reach Eden, but in the end we had too less luck in finding crystallite planets.<br>There was still a little planning for the end because we wanted this to be a bit more than just hitting the Return to Sol-Button, so we delayed my final speech to D17C1 instead of D16C8, I convinced Hua to get to medlab so Eleesha and Derek had a dorm for they own (Eleesha spored Derek to level 2 the days before by being very nice to him) and Andie and Eleesha could easily turn him. At least they could if Eleesha didn't eat her spore by accident and Andie was too bloodthirsty - sigh....<br>The rest you all know: speech, little rampage, return to Sol.</p><p>Oh yeah - what about this spacecows? That's simple: I'm really afraid of space cows. I met them on one of my only 2 expeditions and only throwing a grenade on them saved my life. Really.</p><p>(Now OOC:<br>It was a really awesome ship but very exhausting and I am not sure if I'll try the sneaky way again soon. It's a pain to calculate every single AP, having excuses for everything in mind and especially not getting any benefits from food!<br>Outstanding thanks to all the people I had nice RP with and especially to Paola who was one of the main reasons we only lost 1 person till Day 17. Hope to hear from you.<br>I hope I see all of you actives again!)</p>

                <p>Alpha Mush #2 aka Roland aka Eleesha reporting in! That was a lot of fun, probably one of the most exciting ships I've played on. For a first game as the mush it was pretty insane. Some tactical errors as Roland made him the perfect target for the first mush death, with some pretty intensive planning by JS and some quick actions on both our parts we pulled off quite a little show for everyone. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I hope everyone else had as much fun as we did!</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Sergeant Derek Hogan here. Welp... Kinda disappointed that Hua had higher Glory in the end. I guess I shouldn't have passed on all those expeditions after all; 3 Glory a pop... Guess I won't be immortalized in any scoreboards any time soon!</p><p>Anyway, pretty impressive ship overall. I didn't have a single thought about any Mush being left over, since survival turned into sort of a day job at the end. I remember having concerns about Eleesha, and I also remember that I wanted to motivate rushing the Serum to cure Eleesha just in case, but apparently I completely forgot about it and then just went on with the assumption that we're mush-free. Stupid of me! Ah well.</p><p>I absolutely haven't expected the Roland switcheroo; extremely well done! As old Eleesha said, it is sort of a lesson in that I should've just immediately killed Roland instead of waiting for people's approval; but after a seriously bad Eleesha round (in which I killed several innocents) I had no trust in my investigative abilities anymore and decided to ask the consensus. I don't know whose idea it was to put Jin Su in the confirmed-human channel, considering we had so many of those, and I did ask around how/when he got confirmed, but never got any concise answer. Ergo, the Mush-hunt phase of the ship was a total mess... as usual.</p><p>As great as it is that we reached Day 17, in the end I can't help but feel that the round was immensely "meh" in the end. Bad hunting, bad decision making throughout, and a boring late-game with plenty of drama largely involving Paola... however, what the Mush accomplished behind the scenes is, of course, amazing. Hats off to you.</p><p>Also, I managed to secure a bunch of Mushpedia data, mainly about Andie, alien trading and pregnancy. Not only that, but I got to kick people into storages to send them off into space! Good times.</p>

                <p>Nr. 5 alias (Sub)-lieutenant Andie Graham reporting back to the SDF.~</p><p>I remember my human self being quite suspicious of our Commander as he was declared human for no apparent reason. But like everyone else I was completely fooled, feeling save once we had two dead mush showing up in the crew bar. <br> <br>After being enlighten with the spirit of mush I got a different view on things. <br>Maybe my human self should have noticed that the commander wasn't very eager to get those two spores washed off. Maybe the conversations about races and whenever fighting the mush is the right thing to do should have made me worry.</p><p>But that was nothing in comprehension to the obvious things following my conversion.</p><p>I mean... Lemonhope Star<em>spore</em> Kim-Jiang? And then asking in the forum whenever Confidential works for Mush Andie after having posted log parts of our public conversations earlier. Uh-h I felt the Damocles sword above our heads. <br>But damn shit nobody noticed. I guess that was using up our luck. <br>Sadly we didn't get the 3rd Starmap fragment and Jin Su accidentally extracting a spore with Frieda present was, even for him, a bit to obvious. So we had to go <em>stabby-stabby</em>. Which I personally don't regret. [Though I wasn't the only one who wanted to stab Paola + you wanted to turn everyone except Paola which isn't quite nice either ^^']</p><br><p>Hats off to you, Jin Su and Eleesha Zuccali for pulling an amazing stunt.</p><p>And special thanks for the gold days which sadly didn't come to much use except for... killing Paola. <em>That</em> - wouldn't have been possible without Devoted. Which gives the situation it's own irony as I know she wasn't very happy, with you having given me gold days in the first place. Yeah ... I really love that part. It gave back the amusement she robbed of me.<br> <br>I'm not really a fan of being mush but with the way things went I'm really glad. <br>The ship was real fun to bad we couldn't turn Sergeant Hogan at the end.</p>

                <p>Terrence here! Am I really the only guy you lost before Day 17 and after our Mush hunt was supposedly complete? Wow. Good job on that, considering all of the fires and shakes and those damn oxygen tanks that would not stay fixed.</p><p>On that note: I feel like Hua deserves the top spot in the rankings just for being Queen of the Oxygen Tanks. I don't know how she did it, but she almost always beat me to repairing them, and they blew almost every cycle.</p><p>As for the game overall: It was kind of "meh" from my perspective after Day 10 or so. We weren't worried about mush (though, it seems, we should've been) and all I had to do was roll around the ship fixing everything (and, occasionally, complaining about Paola using all of the Anti-Gravity Scooter charges.) A lot of sleep-and-recharge-AP.</p><p>I was mildly sad that I died, though. I swear I logged off for maybe three cycles and during that time went from 10HP down to zero.</p>

                <p>Gioele The Last Human here.<br>[sips from the last cup of Arabica on the ship]<br>Being paranoid, though, I felt that something is amiss with The List and Eleesha - maybe there was some subtle difference in the manner of posts or something. And, well, I confided this fact to none other than our glorious shroomperson Jin-Su. He told me that I was wrong and... and I believed him. That was it.<br>If it was somebody else, then probably I could vouch for making Pheromodem - I considered it would be really interesting thing to fiddle with. But I guess it was my dislike for Andie that got in the way. Well, he was suspecting me, a proper Caffeine Junkie, in mushroomness, and I felt antagonistic...

Playing at all was quite difficult. And it felt awful having strength only to log in for a few minutes, to update my status and pour my AP into scanning. Still feeling woozy and dizzy, but now I won't have stress of "suddenly remembered about the game, sloppily and sickly fell out of the bed while reaching for a mobile and scared the life out of my beloved wife" moments. It's nice moments to remember, but not that nice to experience - kinda like boot camp, I guess.<br><br>Anyway, best ship I ever had.</span></p>

                <p>Hey - first day without mush since 17 days. An odd feeling if you aks me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now that you mentioned it Derek/Gioele I remember that some of you told me about their suspicions of Eleesha. It's always the absolutely right thing to speak with your glorious Commander about such concerns <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Derek, I'm also sorry to having snatched away all ladies except shroomy Eleesha from you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Andie/Chime: I told you nobody would notice. Mysteries are always easy to look throuhg if you know the solution, but it's damn hard to notice anything if you are sure for *10* days that no mush are on board anymore.</p><p>Gioele, I hope you are well again. I always hoped you will join our RP-train and actually do something against the fact that the Commander, twice as old as your daughter has a romantic relationship with her.</p><p>Just read the last words of Hua. Made me feel a bit sad. Lovely Bumpkin, I really hope you join us here in this thread. I also hope Eleesha (the original one) will join once the game is announced as over.<br>Though I'm a bit sorry about I actually think Paola will be too upset to join this thread at all.</p><p>Hope to see you all again.</p><p>To keep my last speech for eternity I'll just post it here.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">Dear crew,<br>unfortunately I have to tell you that this planet was our last try. We tried very hard, everyone gave his best, I know. I have to tell you something. I have to tell you that I am *proud* of you! Although it is obvious that we did only make it to this point because of my outstanding gloriously-great leadership and astonishing wisdom, everyone of you supportet this journey and was at least somewhat beneficial. Even if we didn't achieve Eden, I am very proud of you, my crew, for surviving this long on a ship falling more and more apart by bad design <em>severe look in direction of Kuan Ti</em><br>I would have really liked to reach the new hungting ground in Eden. But it seems that this strange Random Number God was finally against us.<br><br>Unfortunately I still had some flashbacks from my intermezzo with these nasty spacecows and accidentially removed a little spore right before Frieda's eyes in D16C6. You can check the medlab logs if you want. I am very thankful you didn't notice it before so I am able to say these last words.<br>Before we return to Sol where our friends of the SDF will make sure you are all introduced into our collective, I have to tell you that I really enjoyed studying the human nature.

Also a shame Random Number God didn't provide us with the last Starmap fragment on this last expedition after having nearly 5 days scanning without a single crystallite zone.</p><p>But let me tell you how we managed to trick you all and nearly reached Eden from the beginning.</p><p>When I woke up with my comrade Roland I already had this mission from the collective to seek out for this place called Eden. So it was clear from the first day that our goal would be to be a sneaky part of the team and reach this new hunting ground. <br>Luckily I was in contact with the lovely Paola right before cycle change and due to the lack of an active Chun we found ourselves starting the "Mush-Hunting-Channel". I offered to do a food test any time and expected from Paola to stay clean all the time. Of course the food test was never possible for lack of AP or inactivity or other things.</p><p><strong>Converting Raluca</strong><br>Roland and me made use of all 4 spores in day one, but had to eat some of them to cover our mushy actions. For we extracted several spores right after cycle change, doing secret showers we still had enough spores ready to turn our first victim. Raluca was obviously the best victim for she was mainly inactive and standing in Engine room the first time. We spored her twice in day 2 and Roland could easily give her the last shot in beginning of Day 3, immediately going Anonymush. So short, so easy. After being converted Raluca never said anything again and didn't even move.</p><p><strong>Getting rid of Eleesha</strong><br>This one was the most nasty thing I ever planned. We first thought that our Eleesha was quite unskilled and mainly inactive - but she wasn't as we had to learn soon. For I was very helpful and actively "fighting the mush-menace" she trusted me and contacted me about suspicious actions. I told her of course being part of the secret Mush-Hunt-Team what Derek could confirm (he was proved being human by eating twice at this time). So I had her trust when she told me that Roland was clean when going to shoot hunters and dirty after coming back. His excuse of "checking and loading fuel" couldn't stand of course, but luckily Eleesha had no contact to the Mush-Hunt-Team but to me.<br>I didn't tell the Team, just told some other quite unintersting stuff she reported to me and so the active hunting crew thought Eleesha wasn't very valueable - some were even convinced she was mush herself. But it was absolutely obvious that we had to get rid of her.<br>So I planned and prepared a situation suitable for our final strike into relative security: <br>In day 4 we were in the situation of having 1 spore both. Earlier this day I already told Ian to stay out of the dorms because there might be some Mush-killing-action and we didn't want to lose AP. Then I told the Mush-Hunt-Group of Eleeshas suspicions about Roland (a whole day later than she reported it to me). For it was no 100% evidence and our plan could only work on day change I proclaimed I would interrogate Roland before we kill him, trying to trick him into lies. Of course Roland wasn't online till 1 hour before day change and I could manage to prevent Derek from killing Roland just out of suspicion. I told Eleesha in C5 this day that she should save up AP for we would go after Roland in D5C3. Poor Eleesha.<br>After doing a faked interrogation where Roland told me a wrong morale value and I telling him that that's not possible - exactly 60 seconds before cycle change - Roland entered the Dorm in which Eleesha and me were, removed the camera, spored her once and transferred into her. I immediately spored Rolands old body once, went out of room and after day change produced a spore and re-entered dorm. Roland (now Eleesha) did the same and spored old Roland the second time. I gave him the last shot and took Anonymush myself. Then I cried for help in all channels that Roland was after me and fled from the dorm. Eleesha, helpful as she was, attacked Roland immediately and Derek was a bit pissed that Roland was already dead when he entered dorm.<br>(The whole action took 90 seconds and was the most adrenaline-pumping thing I ever did in mush).<br>So we had our first confirmed dead mush.</p><p><strong>Going into the shadows</strong><br>Now it got very easy for us. There was some distraction from my side about spores upon me etc. but in the end it was obious that Raluca was mush when she didn't starve to death at the end of Day 5. So Derek finished her - glad he could kill someone - and we had our second dead mush at beginning of day 6. Of course Eleesha now wasn't able to print the list and the whole crew could breath up. I guaranteed that Roland didn't transfer into Eleesha and pretended that we had a secret codeword for this case - as I had it with Paola.</p><p><strong>Boredom and Research</strong><br>The days were now something between boredom and pain - at least for me because I couldn't stop being the always caring, glorious commander. All without any AP from food. Our Research team did damn good and due to Constatispore-Serum it was also no longer possible to get a little AP from sporing and Phagocyte. Long story short - I wanted to go on with something suitable for my evil mastermind. I first though about turning Paola, but that would have been a very big cripple of our team for she was the one in the end who held the ship together, being always everywhere. I also got a bit afraid of the activities of our Lieutenant Graham for Pheromodem would doom us if we would spike any other person - what I actually wanted to do. Also I had the feeling it wouldn't be appreciated by the collective to let this Andie-thing research an Anti-Mush-Serum.<br>So the next victim was selected easily - and so was the plan. I had some private talks with most of the crew members and it was quite easy to convince the very devote Lieutenant to do some physical action without a camera. Eleesha spored her once when she was standing in Icarus Bay so it only 3 nice little events from my side were actually needed. I could convince her to do it the last time at a cycle where our hyper-active Paola ususally wasn't this active. So it was easy to get her take Anonymush in time without anyone noticing.</p><p><strong>The End</strong><br>The end is told very quickly: For nearly all of our AP was needed to heal crew members, seek out crystallite planets and doing morale speeches it was not possible to extract many spores at all. We really tried hard to reach Eden, but in the end we had too less luck in finding crystallite planets.<br>There was still a little planning for the end because we wanted this to be a bit more than just hitting the Return to Sol-Button, so we delayed my final speech to D17C1 instead of D16C8, I convinced Hua to get to medlab so Eleesha and Derek had a dorm for they own (Eleesha spored Derek to level 2 the days before by being very nice to him) and Andie and Eleesha could easily turn him. At least they could if Eleesha didn't eat her spore by accident and Andie was too bloodthirsty - sigh....<br>The rest you all know: speech, little rampage, return to Sol.</p><p>Oh yeah - what about this spacecows? That's simple: I'm really afraid of space cows. I met them on one of my only 2 expeditions and only throwing a grenade on them saved my life. Really.</p><p>(Now OOC:<br>It was a really awesome ship but very exhausting and I am not sure if I'll try the sneaky way again soon. It's a pain to calculate every single AP, having excuses for everything in mind and especially not getting any benefits from food!<br>Outstanding thanks to all the people I had nice RP with and especially to Paola who was one of the main reasons we only lost 1 person till Day 17. Hope to hear from you.<br>I hope I see all of you actives again!)</p></cite><p>Great story man, it reminds me of the first time I was mush when we took down a camera and did a transfer right as the day changed. We lost a mush in ours too due to some things going wrong as people became active during the day change, but I remember the adrenaline <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And we did end up winning that ship! It's too bad about your cell phone gaff, it sounds like you are a master mush.</p>

                <p>Eleesha here. All this great planning was possible because I was extremely annoyed by <strong>Paola </strong>and was busy in real life. I undestood Jin Su was mush right before going to sleep on C8. I was sure I wrote Derek about this (but seems I did not) I also wanted to contact Paola (though I promised not to talk to her untill the game ends) and tell her that I was going to kill Jin Su right after Roland but she didn't have free tabs. When I found myself dead and read the logs I thought this ship will end in a Day because missing camera means 100% transfer... I've seen this too many times and hoped others had seen that as well. I really hoped Derek would understand everything too. I told him that Jin Su and I agreed to Kill Rolnd on C4 and when they killed him/me on C1 I thought this and missing camera was also too obvious. Anyways good job. And if Paola reads this he/she should really change here way of talking to people. Well and on my next ship I had the same situation: mush trying to hold me off killing. Didn't last long this time. Thanks for the lesson. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p>
