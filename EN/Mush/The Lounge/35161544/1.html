                <p>As title says, there were 5 mush in the game and we have succesfully slaughtered all the crew. Alpha mush Gioele here. Other alpha was Finola. <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2089" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2089</a></p><p>I gotta say I've had just unlocked Gioelse Paranoid skill and really wanted to give a hard time to mush with those 5 cameras, while doing some RP. Usually I want to be a mush since its a rare occasion but not this time. And well, it picked me up. Finola was in the same situation as she told me - she just wanted to be a good researcher, rushed the gas, and well... ended up Mush. Thats some lesson for you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I never do anything that would put any party in disadvantage untill the roles are set.</p><p>Anyway, I'm not really good at recapping things but basicly what happened from my side.</p><p>As a bronze alpha mush that didnt have to take anonymous asap, and as I've learned from previous games that Trapping is a powerfull skill, I decided to go with it. So I started my mush activities by extracting 3 spores and Trapping some shelves in Icarus bay and rear storage. Chao ended up with a spore. Later i think Frieda also got one. I really had the urge to turn Raluca that way early on, trapping and then going there resetting the pilgred, since she was told to stay in a turret. Terrence appeared to be a very active gold user, and was really an appealing target. Still I decided to concentrate on whoever got the Icarus bay/ Rear storage spores first. Some time later I saw chao standing in Rear corridor, and spored him another one.</p><p>Research went forward, mycoalarms were almost done, and we urgently needed to turn Chao. Unfortunately he started to hide in the dorms all the time and there was no way we could do it. At some point I thought that maybe that was his plan - to stay exposed and get mush waste their spores on him. <br>Anyway, Janice had a spore from Finola. I was playing as if i was semi inactive, spending most of the time on the bead since the 4AP per spore thing kicked in, and having to wasg each time and then heal myself secretly in the lab just ate AP like crazy. After faking eating, Finola said that Janice was vulnerable in the Lab and that we could turn her. So I rushed to the lab and and we did it.<br> I thought that Finola was bronze too and knew she had chosen some lvl 7 skill. It was a risky move but I was a bit desperate to turn someone, no matter what the consequences. Much to my surprise, Finola took anonymush and I was in not a such a bad situation afterall! Ive ran out of AP and needed a reason to show up in lab and get dirty, so asked for some fake cover up as if I did some research and it seems nobody noticed. <br>Janice turned out to be a gold user, and that turned her to be even better target than Chao. <br>At this point chun had placed around the mycoalarms so we had to be careful. Raluca switched to working on Nexus projects, staying in the rear corridor. Thats when Janice I think decided to try the luck and just spored her. We then didn't have much trouble to turn her completely, and as Janice did it she also took anonymush. So we were 4, while it showed 2.</p><p>It was around day 6, Mysoscan got finished, Chao still had the 2 spores, that didnt let me breathe calmly. The general chat was pretty quiet in regards of mush hunt, nobody shared the Tabularix in public and so I knew that there was already a circle of trusted members, private Anti-Mush league as some would say formed and brainstorming the ideas. I felt that they would eventually start to kill most suspicious people, as there were only 2 dead inactives and it was already a day 7. For the last 2 days i havent really done anything in regards of research, was sleeping in Medlab acting inactive, and felt that they would come and get me. <br>So I've decided to act. Chao was in the laboratory now under the mycoalarm, with Chun, Ian and Finola there. I've decided to make up a story that camera from the bridge had to be installed in the lab instead of mycoalarm because it detects more things and nobody goes to bridge anyway. Atleast some kind of alibi, right? So I went into the lab, only to realise I FORGOT to spore. Facepalmed, went back to medlab, spored, got back, removed the mycoalarm, turned Chao, went to bridge, put myco, took camera and installed it back to the lab. <br>In the result of such manipulations I was dirty and had no chance to get to dorm to wash. So I sat there thinking that I was a toast. Chun would come online, see me dirty removing mycoalarm... and a new non-anonymush Mush. Plus, after I lied on the bed, Ian came into the medlab and left. I dont know what he was thinking but I felt he saw me dirty. NOW there was really no chance to get through the night. One of the fellow mushies then told me that removing/installing a cam can get you dirty, and that calmed me for a bit but again, raised a question, whether I should report it ASAP or no. We decided to not to, and it was a right thing to do. Chun had apparently went inactive, nobody seemed to come inside the lab to see what I had done.</p><p>Janice then decided to get violent and went to the dorms, attacked Hua. Wasnt the best move and I think we should have waited to expose ourselves as we had 2 anonymush and there were still 8 active humans. Anyway, she wasted all ap, but didnt finish hua, and then decided to go to Icarus bay and switch bodies with Frieda who had a spore for god knows how long. Some confusion about why Janice attacked Hua started in the main chat and Finola just went there and finished him. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Kuan Ti then fell for the trap and went and killed Janice without no questioning, saying something about NERONs only friend bonus being gone and thus she was a mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Couldn't be any better, we didn't have to kill her ourself. High five Kuan! xD</p><br><p>Anyway, Frieda, to whos body transfered Janice had some ap, so she Mutated and killed Roland and Terrence in a moment. I decided to mutate too because Chun had Armor and killed her. Despite Chun being inactive, she had a knife and posed a real threat. Plus, I counted on the -2 morale on the day change. We acted a bit too early, it was cycle 4 I think, but oh well. Raluca was also there, she grabbed the knife, armour and went to kill Paola.</p><p>The only problem now were 3 Humans in Bravo dorm - Ian with his pacifistm, Kuan and Eleesha.</p><p>Unfortunately I couldnt be there to protect Finola and Frieda in time as I planned. Kuan and Eleesha had their retaliation. Thinking now about it, we should have probably went to bravo dorm all, to be also protected under Ian. Anyway, humans didnt want to let themselves get killed so easily, and so they went out for some banna supplies, also brought a cat to the dorm. The cat didnt help though - After day change, just before we went in for a final blow, Ian died of depression. Oh yes, such a sweet death. I had 4 Ap, planned to hit eleesha once and now had 4 tries! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> We slaughtered her, Raluca stabbed Kuan but he managed to escape, although not for long.</p><br><p>Wow when you start writing, you actually begin to follow what was going on. Anyway, it was a very cool ship, I really enjoyed it despite my first negative reaction when I saw I was mush. Hope that during this new ship I wont be one...gotta relax for a bit. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Thanks all mushies you were awesome. Human team I think got unlucky, plus they had a new players Eleesha and Raluca who i think despite everything did a great job. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>P.S. I wonder if we would have went with Ralucas suggestion to fix pilgred and punch it to sol would give us mush more Glory? Not that I care about it much, I had definitely more fun seeing all those NERON death announcements one after another, but we would technically be alive then.</p>

                <p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> here. Great job on the mush side. There were 5 mushes and I was thinking mush were 2 inactives or at least weren't turning others. I thought we were doing pretty good. Projects were going really well, research was a bit slow though and so were comms because of an inexperienced Paola. Anyway, we had a pretty active crew, so I thought we might make it to Sol, if only we'd find those damn mushes.</p><p>But then suddenly on day 7 a 3rd mush showed up on the bar and Hua was killed. I noticed Finola's post (or was it Frieda?) about Janice hitting Hua and noticed while in nexus that NERON's only friend bonus was gone. I know some skill effects are lost when becoming mush and thought that one was among them, so I killed Janice, assuming she was the 3rd mush that showed up in the bar. Realized my mistake after killing her that I didn't check if she still had 3 skills, which she probably didn't have because of a gold player body switching with a non-gold player (sorry about that Frieda/Janice). I then knew Finola and Frieda were mush, Finola was already on my suspect list because the slow research progress after finishing antispore so fast (and finishing off Hua confirmed my suspicions).</p><p>Still there wasn't much I could do, since I was the only human online at the time, so I just went to BD where Ian was. Then the massacre happened and all humans aside from me, Ian and Eleesha were killed (RIP Terrence, Roland, Chun and Paola). Bit later on Eleesha logged in and told me Gioele and Chao were also mush, which left us with only the 3 of us humans in the dorm. Eleesha went to pick up some food for us with the scooter and the 2 of us went to finish off Finola. Frieda was already killed by Eleesha on her own by then, so it was 3 vs. 3. (Eleesha, Ian and me vs. Raluca, Chao &amp; mutated Gioele)</p><p>Then Ian got online and told us he had only 1 morale remaining, so he would die on day change if he didn't gain any morale. There still were 1 or 2 bananas in the dorm, but Ian was apparantly full, so he couldn't eat them. In the meantime he had went out to take the medkit and healed 3 of my 4 diseases and my HP from 3 to 12. When I got back later that cycle, I took the scooter and went to grab the cat for him in return. (I had 3 AP and no MP at that moment because of the diseases.) Anyway, it looks like Ian didn't have the AP to hug the cat after healing me and Eleesha or he didn't come online in time because he died of depression on day change. Immediately mush swarmed us in BD and killed Eleesha. I punched Raluca off her bed with my 2 AP I had remaining and ran to the other dorm with the 2 MP, but to no avail as I was killed quickly afterwards.</p>

You've done a great job in playing mush and also motivating me. I can't believe how much luck we had with all of these little coincidences. And how the ... could Chao, who got two spores in the early Day 2, remain human for so long, aaah <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/tusors.gif" alt=":anim_out:" class="tid_ico"> , that nearly made me crazy....</p><p>Few additions to your story above:<br>I started this game as Medic/Bio and then became Alpha Mush. You can't imagine what a bad combination that was....You can advance each research for more than 15% with just 2 Ap. This makes it so obvious if you don't research, but yeah, they suspected me but didn't act....I'm such a lucker <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/cool.gif" alt=":anim_cool:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Well, in the first days i wasn't sure about how to play the mushie side of life, so i just tried the Slimetrap skill, Not very successfull...and with the antispore gas, i got my first spore at day 3 or so. I was a little bit pissed....and Chao was still under cover and not reachable. Frustration rose and I just spiked the first person not under a camera.....guess who......yeah, of course, Janice.</p><p>Back to business in the lab, I advanced the mycoalarms to 80% and waited for the next day to finish. That was the moment, when Janice suddenly arrived in the lab and stayed(every nerve was strained and I just hoped for the f** day change before Janice would leave the lab) ....Day changed, she was still there and yeah, you mentioned it, I screamed for your help and we got her ...... Such a lovely moment <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"> ..... I was silver, so i activated anonymush and we were fine.<br><br>With Ralu it was quite similar. I saw someone alone in the rear corridor, so i went done there and yeah, Ralu, alone in the room. It looked like a trap, I was pretty sure, that it has to be a trap(hidden mycoalert). But yeah, I scrambled through the log, there were always more than 2 people in the room, so no hidden alert and yeah, I was already there, what had I to loose? <br>Together with Janice you finished the job next day and nobody noticed it. I still can't believe this ^^ but maybe, sometimes you just need a big portion of luck.<br><br>Then the hell had begun. It was so confusing and without any organization, Janice tried to kill Hua, but failed. I finished it and with a human killed and Janice transfering out of danger, I just stated: "Hua wasn't Mush, so janice must be" to reinforce Friedas positon. Well, Kaun ti acted as we wanted him to do (he already explained why) and Janice was dead quite fast. Frieda started her massacre and with two more dead human's, I couldn't breave anymore. I just laid on the floor and laughing my a of. Such a cool moment xD <br>(btw. i wrote the number of dead humans simultanously in a mibbit chat with other mushie players, and everyone just asked, what the hell i was doing... <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/sifflote.gif" alt=":-&quot;" class="tid_ico"> )<br><br>Then Eleesha attacked Chao, but failed. When she was out of Ap, I healed Chao. Not my best idea on this ship....Eleesha realised that I was also mush and killed me together with Kuan Ti. Quite booring end for this great ship.<br><br><br>Nice to see that you were able to hunt down all humans and finally finished them. Ahhh, what a great ship. Big thanks to all mushies, you've done such a great job! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p>
