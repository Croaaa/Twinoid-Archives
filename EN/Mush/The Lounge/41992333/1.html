Hope that you guys will stick around and find this thread from the endpage (or maybe message you guys when names are shown, although that could be too late), as there was potential there for good players. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Apart from those three, I would like to honor Jin Su for being a good captain, which is rare in itself.<br>Roland and Eleesha were active too, grats on that. By activity here, I mean that they were alive on the ship 6+days and do visible progress.</p><p>About the ship...well... nothing much happened. The typical tropes of barely getting an o2 planet before suffocating, after 2-3 projects/researches barely any progress happens, not finishing Pilgred until the last minute was there.<br>Only difference is that the mushes weren't outed in the first day but...just layed back, trapping all day all night I assume. Mycoscan showed that multiple people had 2 spores on them, by day ten. That is 10, TEN days where they didn't really do anything just trap, and yet not a single mush infestation seemed to happen. Strange, as Raluca was killed, then Derek, that nobody was turned. Still, they managed to kill our Chun, but at that point it didn't really matter, as Janice was afk from the start, and Jin had to do speeches anyway. Would have they killed him, or me (as the only technician before Eleesha got the book and the only scanner after Frieda died), it would have been much worse. Even killing Roland would have meant that after our Plasma shield dies (which it did once), we would simply get shot down.<br>Still, I coudl argue that by laying low, they bought time as we weeded out the inactives, since our anti mush group was...less than effective, for various reasons. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So...what else can I say? We got a handful of good people, some mushes who certainly had their reasons, and about half a ship of inactives, or barely active people who only logged in 'till day 3. Most of the inactives were "less important people", like Gioele and Stephen, we were fortunate to go this far, but it still took a toll on the ship, as by day10, I beleive we reached the point where our AP had to be locked down on keeping the ship, and us, alive.</p><p>At least I returned to sol with a hot coffee in my hand. If only I could have finished the damn Kube...</p><br><p>Edit: Just remembered: Kuan Ti, you died 1 cycle away from getting o2. Why? BECAUSE GIOELE TOOK AN o2 CAPSULE OUT! Was swiftly killed, for that, but it was noticed way too late. To this moment, I'm hesitant if I should have reported Gioele for indirectly killing you, or not.</p>

                <p>Jin Su reporting in. Somehow it felt like we never had enough AP to go around, even though it seemed like our activity level should have been sufficient to go on longer. I tried to lead the mush hunt several times, but it was frustrating because there were something like 5 players spending so little AP they could be 8 AP every day sporing. I remember the first human we killed, Andie, had gone 3 days without doing anything except showering twice. What the heck else are we supposed to do except kill you?</p><p>As for the slow mush progess, they were actually eliminated day 7, and Raluca didn't get dirty until day 6, so Derek was the only one sporing. I have no idea what Raluca thought she was doing, but she was not contributing to the mush team in any significant manner. I flagged Derek as my most probable candidate for being mush around day 5, but I was reluctant to kill him as he was doing more than several other players, which is sad because he was spending 8 AP/day sporing and showering daily.</p>
