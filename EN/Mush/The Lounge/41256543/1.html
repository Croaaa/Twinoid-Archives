What a journey... vampires and a kidnapped Teddy bear, mush traps, a sneaky mush, a Houdini cat, mush traps again, heroic drones, a friendly Mankarog and mush traps <em>again</em>...</p><p>Our trip started 20 days ago, and our first alpha mush, Kuan Ti, was killed rather quickly after a courageous attempt at defacing the logs in Alpha dorm and spiking me. Then followed a maddening hunt for the second mush that lasted about 10 days, and which nearly drove us mad from trying to decide who to cure and who to kill.</p><p>"So, should we cure Raluca ?"<br>"But she geniused the serum, so either she's not mush or she doesn't deserve to be cured."<br>"Should we kill her, then ?"<br>"What if she's human ?"<br>"Then we should cure Roland, and if he's human, we kill Raluca."<br>"How about Hua ?"<br>"No, I don't think that Hua's mush... but it's possible."<br>"Well, I don't think that Roland is mush."<br>"What about Frieda ? What do we do about her ?"<br>"And Janice ?"<br>"Ok, so we cure Frieda, and if we're wrong, we kill Raluca, Roland, Janice and Hua."<br>"No, we should cure Hua and then kill Raluca, Frieda, Janice and Roland."<br>"What if we started by curing Roland ?"<br>"As for me, I don't think we should cure anyone."<br>"But we might kill innocent people."<br>"Then we cure someone, but who ?"<br>"How about Stephen, by the way ? No offence, Stephen, but you're not confirmed human."<br>"No, I'm not offended, but I rather suspect Eleesha."<br>"But I told you, I can't be mush, I killed Kuan Ti."<br>"Okaaay, then should we cure Roland ?"<br>"No, should we kill Raluca ?"<br>"I think we should cure Frieda. Or Hua. Or... or Frieda, actually. Or maybe Hua ?"</p><p>By some miracle, we ended up curing Frieda, who <em>was</em> our second mush, without killing anyone. But with a few migraines. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Then we began our quest for starmap fragments, exploring countless cristallite fields and encountering mush trap after mush trap... after mush trap (5 in all, I believe). We had almost given up hope when we decided to choose between two cristallite planets, one with a Mankarog and fuel, or one with no Mankarog and no fuel. The beast turned out to be a fluffy, friendly monster who gave us an artefact, but Hua got lost trying to find the last starmap fragment. We rescued her, fled the planet (who knows what fluffy monsters become after their nap ?) and decided on a last-chance planet, our worst expedition, which did allow us to find the last fragment, but also proved to be deadly. We scraped together all the food left on the ship, jumpkins, rations, coffees, fruits, even the remains of poor quarantined Derek, in the hope of calculating the coordinates of Eden and moving the ship before the end of the expo, but failed and couldn't save Andie. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> Frieda eventually hacked the command terminal and launched the trip to Eden after the expo, without waiting for our vampire commander to wake up (what kind of a vampire sleeps at night anyway ?).</p><p>And now that we've landed safely on the Promised Land, Chun and Eleesha have the honour to invite you all to their wedding, after which they plan on living a long, happy life with their baby daughters. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Stephen here.</p><p>I enjoyed the long mush hunt. I find that it's much preferable to mush who rampage early. <br>We did have a lead on Frieda (who didn't do anything actively mushy or visit bravo dorm) as she seemed to need a lot of morale - something like d4c8: confide in Andie, d5c3: Kaladaan rebel base, d5c5: confide in Andie again - but we didn't act on it and got distracted by her decision to stay guarding Front Corridor instead of transferring to Jin Su who strangely had been left out of one of the expeditions. Some of us may have been refreshing like mad at the time, but Frieda couldn't know that and it might have worked anyway...</p><p>In the end, we made the call to cure Frieda because we had cleared 10 players of being alpha mush and Eleesha and I were considered unlikely mush due to our involvement in KT's death so it was down to Frieda and Hua. Not the most satisfying way to get there as half of those cleared had done food tests (which I strongly dislike) - some more intentionally than others. Without those tests it's quite possible that humans would had been killed before Frieda.</p><br><p>I get bored on the long, well-run ships, but that's not the fault of the particular crew. I find that the late-game mechanics are not very interesting, and Eden is too luck-based for me to get excited about.<br> <br>At least the final expedition was exciting with me taking 12 damage from fatigue and accidents and our risk-loving diplomat getting killed while visiting the first seven sectors - on a planet with eight possible combat events. That could have ended much worse for the rest of the expedition crew, but the last two events were peaceful.</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_25055 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="25055">groomsh</span></span><cite>(just look at the number of found planets - <strong>127</strong> !).</cite><p>127 is (probably) not the actual number - the counter just doesn't go any higher.

Didn't get to interact with you much, but kind of surprised when on D19C8 you were quarantined! <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_surprise.gif" alt=":O" class="tid_ico"> And I didn't even get to eat your corpse. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> At least you took the quarantine in stride though, so good on you!</p><p><strong>Eleesha </strong>- My lovely fiancee and the most amazingly beautiful mush hunter! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"> Also the father of my daughters thanks to wonderful science from Ian and Andie! I can't wait to spend the rest of my days with you in a lovely house on Eden raising our daughters together! You were amazing with activity, always around to fix O2 tanks, give out heals, give me a wonderful time in the lab <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico">, and trying to find mush when there was nothing mushy going on! And the best part is you stayed with me even after...revelations that would have turned most people away.<em> Chun kisses Eleesha again</em> Oh, and we should definitely do something about that perverted Houdini cat, I don't trust it.</p><p><strong>Frieda </strong>- Dedicated planet scanner and former mush-turned-human. Was kind of sad you didn't use Infector + Fertile to come help Kuan Ti convert Eleesha in AD, and also a bit sad that as mush you were sending us to such amazing planets, but I can understand how the suddenness of what happened coupled with being mush Frieda on such an active ship might have scared you off. Regardless, you found us a lot of cristalite planets and we couldn't have made it without you! And believe me it was a pleasure to jab a needle into you. Thanks for hacking us to Eden in the end!</p><p><strong>Gioele</strong> - Sorry it wasn't all cocaine and hookers for you this trip, and I'm sorry about you losing your daughter. Maybe you and Hua can start a new family together, as I'm sure the two of you will have more <em>coffee breaks</em> together. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Have to say, never got a chance to see a caffeine junkie/astrophysicist Gioele actually make such good use of the skill combo! Most of the time they're stuck doing healing rounds. Was fun to play off your RP though there, and I think I'm kind of glad you didn't have a child with Eleesha (no offense <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ). <em>I still wouldn't mind seeing if you are better in bed than Ian though, just don't tell my fiancee <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> </em></p><p><strong>Ian</strong> - Our dedicated botanist and scientist! You and Andie like I've mentioned killed research. It was crazy how fast you two got things knocked out! And because of your efforts, I'm pregnant ON EDEN with Eleesha's daughters. Thank you! And don't worry about that planet, it was hardly your fault that Andie died. If it wasn't for you, we'd be on Sol instead of Eden! Oh, and it's a nice feeling being on Eden without mush this time isn't it? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Janice</strong> - Uh, how did you survive this far? Never once spoke AT ALL. Actively ignored any PM we sent, but I guess you had your use. Kept us from suiciding when we asked for hugs.</p><p><strong>Hua</strong> - Lovable pilot, kept up Gioele's morale and killed some hunters with Roland and Stephen! Happy to have you around doing whatever we needed! And I'm really glad Frieda was mush so we didn't have to kill you! Sadly my activity seemed to always be when you weren't active and vice versa, so didn't get nearly as much direct interaction with you as I would have liked. Regardless, thanks for the sapphires! They bring out Eleesha's eyes perfectly. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> - Evil vampire who kidnapped Teddy. Need I say more? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> (Sorry, would have liked for you to officiate a wedding on board, but the steel plates and room shakes got in the way. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> )</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> - Mushy designer that sabotaged the ship for us! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> It's a shame that despite your efforts you were caught off-guard by Observant and then Stephen AND Eleesha were both watching you when you did your thing. Still, you tried your best and was just terribly unlucky. Your ghost proved to be a nuisance though, jamming the O2 pump and breaking the O2 tanks all the time. Would have been nice to have you around though!</p><p><strong>Paola</strong> - You will be missed. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> It was sad to lose you, I'm sure your father is having his own issues. Kind of wished you didn't food test yourself, but I knew that you were determined to do it. You were good while you were around, despite the newbie mistakes you made with comms, which are completely understandable. Maybe we'll name one of our daughters after you when we get settled in to Eden.</p><p><strong>Raluca</strong> - Not much to say, except that your activity made you the greatest target (really, why didn't you care if a potentially mush-Paola could trade you away?) until you food tested yourself. Would have liked to see more communication from our resident female vampire, but I guess that's how you types are? Oh, and thanks for giving us the cure! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Roland</strong> - Pretty quiet fellow, but kept up your job killing hunters really well and made sure we knew what you were doing. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Also, was kind of messing with the hunt when you joked pre-selection about green jelly and sure enough! Green Jelly was used. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Stephen</strong> - Your activity was rivaling Eleesa's at some points! <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_surprise.gif" alt=":O" class="tid_ico"> <em>Chun still doesn't trust the filthy cross-dressing stalker</em> You were good and reliable, and proved extremely useful helping out wherever needed, be it shooting hunters, healing people, or participating in expos. It was also nice to play off you for RP purposes, just don't touch my wife ok? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Terrence</strong> - You didn't have very many active cycles, but you were nice when you were around. Would have liked a bit more communication but you got the job done when you could, be it repairing people or O2 tanks.</p><p><strong>Chun</strong> - We don't talk about her in civilized society.</p>
