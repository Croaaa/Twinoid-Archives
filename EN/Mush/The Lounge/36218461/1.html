                <p>Dear Crew,<br><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2798">Game Honors</a></p><p>I was Jin Su and we started so strong!</p><p>Finola messed up by extracting a spore while Gioele was sleeping in medlab. Kaun Ti entered near the same time and ate some pills. The crew leapt into action and we had both mush dead before the end of day 1!</p><p>And then we got a star map on our first expedition. Such a great begining.</p><p>Unfortunately, Hua was a tasty treat and took all the damage on the second expo. This left us with me as the only pilot. Hua, your loss hurt, but we tried to go on so your death wasn't in vain! We lost Stephen on another mission and found him dead under a rock. Very upsetting and that spelled the end for us. We returned to Sol.</p><p>Special call outs to: Hua- our first loss and great, eager pilot , Stephen - we couldn't survive long without your blue slop, Chao who never got to use torturer but was a great second, Paola who manned the comms, Janice who kept us sane, Chun who made sure we had all the bananas, Gieole who kept the ship together, Frieda who kept on top of planets, Raluca who got us coffee super fast, and Eleesha who was ever quiet, but always helping.</p><p>Thanks for making it fun run!</p>

                <p>So why we jumped back to Sol, in case anyone is interested.</p><p>It was the aracks, asteroids and trax combined with the cascading deaths (including a player who had been active). We had 40 shield rapidly decreasing. I tried to jump us away from the last planet, but we had aracks show up again. Chun took out most of them, but we couldn't quite get them all. I asked if we wanted to go back now or hold out a little longer and those who were active at the time. Gio had only 4morale and we just couldn't handle the enemies coming at us. If we could have gotten shield or a pilot book.... but looks like we used up good luck early on. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway, with the active crews input, I made the call to jump before we lost anyone else to suicide.</p><p>The stupidest death was our inactive Terrence who woke up day four, or so, and jumped in a patrol ship. We had pilot lock off so someone other than our pilots could launch the expo. He made some comment about being stuck in space, but as we had magnetic net, it seemed like no big deal. However, we somehow left him behind? No one is quite sure what happened there.</p>
