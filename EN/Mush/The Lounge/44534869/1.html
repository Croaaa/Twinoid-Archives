                <p>Ship end link : <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6772" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6772</a><br>Soo i was Kuan Ti in here, This ship was cursed from first why? You ask : 1.No techs 2. If you gather all people post that they done they won't get 40% of my posts <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ((And thats sad <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">)) 3.I can say no good pilots 4. A griefer Janice that killed herself in first cycle she woke up 5. just 2 gold players and others were bronze mostly and some silver too .</p><p><strong>General View</strong><br>Ok when i woke up i go worked on projects and establish signal, and go for a sleep other came in at first they seems kinda active people some n00bs that i offered my help to them and etc.<br><strong>Me being an Asshole</strong><br>I should say something that i am ashamed at first of this game i become an ass that made game go a little wrong. So after mush selection,When Ian asked for pots i go to gather them and ran whole of ship, This was sad since a mush would do that ((But none done a relay so i was bored)) Tryed signal and some other stuff and get back to dorm. There i find out "Dang they may think i am mush" ((I was human)) So i opened a chat with Chun and there i was like an ass said to not kill me and i am ready for any test and stuff. Ok i say i was wrong but Chun here done something that get her killed later ((kinda)). Told me i am suck and close chat with me then opened some others so i can't get her to chat again. After this i was like "DAMN Soroosh why being an ass here" So after that i said i will play as one of best human players so manybe she forgive me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Mush Hunting</strong><br>So before mush selection i talked alot with people. When mush selection was done ((since they were mostly new)) i start to see personalitty change ((Since i kinda feel when newbs get Mush they try to talk less)) So guess what? hua that until then was only one that answered me kinda fast didn't talk anymore. That made me suspect her more until hunters came and Roland and Andie get out to kill them ((They were good only problem they stay out to regain AP to land and didn't talk about it)) so i then what i saw Hua statue "Online" So a pilot when they are still some left out ((Andie and Roland wasn't able to kill them all)) Since they sleep for 3 cycle? So i find our first mush but see Chun didn't closed Private chat here so i couldn't talk with her and i didn't trust others. And i was tired since i was studying for something like 10 hour. So i said i will try my luck tomorrow ((It was 1 AM)) So i go to sleep when got back Chun was dead as well as hua. What happened? Hua rush to Chun and attack her Morale and drop it at 0 and Chun attack hua and killed her. So this teach me if i was Chun always have one less Private chat so maybe aeven an ass may bring some good news. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>So moving on i was kinda pissed off since i find one but wasn't able to kill it so i put all my efforts on find second one. I worked on Neron then go find planets ((here i kinda did food test)) and get to sleep so there i put my focus on <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So Paola got list of infected ones,Four people was out of the list,Three were killed ((one traded)) Three were done food test and two were inactive so we reached to four people :Jin,Ian,Roland,Andie. So until 2 fire was in ship and our Extinguisher was hidden. ((No human would do that for sure)) it was in FC so Roland and Andie out <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I kinda laid a lame trap since i kinda was sure jin is mush but wanted to make sure.((Since i was asking him to raise morale but he didn't done anything while was online)) So i go put Extinguisher in CC and said i will go for 3 cylces not sure how he think of it but he hide it -.- I was like "What ahhh god Noob mush are really easy to catch)) So i talked with Stephen and RRaluca and Paola and Paola killed him <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> "<br><strong>How we died</strong><br> It was 90% Inactivity , 7% RGN and 3% mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And i am really honest about it later if anyone want i can explain why <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>So Raluca did a heroic thing and go to Storage room and tryed to be inactive taht she was Success <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> But oh god hunters <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Since we didn't had alot Pilot ((and Paola killed Andie)) In end we died :-\.</p><br><br><p>Sorry for talking too much i just liked this ship alot <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In end i want to thank :<br>Paola: She was great only did two mistakes : 1.Bring mush Hunting talks to main chat 2.Killing Andie <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br>Ian: Since in time of action he came out <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>Raluca : for heroic work she done ((She just picked Deatached by the way))<br>Chun : An apologize from me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>And i didn't report Janice as griefer i hope you did <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And thats all sorry for long talks <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>
