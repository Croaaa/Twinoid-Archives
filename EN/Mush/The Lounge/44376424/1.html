                <p>Ok i just died in this ship that ain't finish yet but before leaving game again for some months i want ot make something clear <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> ((If ship got finish and some of my crew read this put Ending link here thx))<br>Ok so i was Ronald <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Due to my studies i decided to pick someone to have some simple job <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> And i just log in do that go <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> But ahhhh <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br>So let me tell you story: I begun with Ronald and soon start working on Signald eat and then go kill hunters and then go to AD <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> ((To Jin : This all happened before mush selection <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> So you had a wrong proof here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)) <br>Well then in D1C7 ship get full.Our Alpha ones was Raluca and Hua....No offense but they were pretty much not that good <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Raluca did a mistake go repair Pilgred and got dirty (completely in first view everyone agreed she is mush) They extracted and then go and booty trap so many shelfs xD So until here i just leaved Dorm twice to just go and do projects (no hunters) Until we found a planet i go to IB that there our noob Hua booty trap in front of me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> So i do as always shout in mic and run out and saw Genrade so i get it (there was people in there) And ran but Hua get to Dorm pick Apron and Soap and run off with a patrol ship (Another noob mistake she took wrong one LOL <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">))Well so everything was good i put down genrade and then go to IB to pick my spacesuit that i become mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> So i took Annonymush and said in main chat that i have one spore on myself and with that reason i go to Dorms again <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I leaved for exam and when back they killed Raluca and knowed there was a Beta too. So here i was so normal you know never done something to make people suspect me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I just maybe talked too much about my morale <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Well in here ELEESHA AND JIN decided to kill Terrence since he was in a room with both mush.((So i didn't really did anything to make you people want to kill him why told in chat that it was my idea ? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">))</p><br><br><p>I accept since i had shooter so i killed that guy with one shoot then slept in BD.Before this Ian was killed by me too due inactivity and holding apron. Well anyway After this ship go on and i had great plans for this ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But my cousins came to my house and my net was slow as always and i just got a good plan <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> We didn't had Janice and no Ian for banana and our Only morale source was sex and Jin leader skill. My plan was when i had full AP i go and kill Eleesha in BD then transform to Jin and then with some other good plans make you get into some deep shit.But when i leaved one of my cousins got sick so i took him to hospital and there with my laptop i said "Lets Finish this"</p><p>This was wrong Since Eleesha didn't died i guess she had armor oh well And i also thought "Thank to experience" that transfer to others cost AP (( I did once in past and that was Ian it cost 2 AP and i thought it same for everyone <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)) If in that time i took Jin i could kill Eleesha only tech and most active person and just leave then ship would be mess so but i didn't know it no AP So i leave for BD start making soooo many stories <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> That actually i impressed <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Since yea actually it was really possible Eleesha be mush too due to her running around (but dang she did food test just a hour ago :-\) <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So i took a little time from crew to do a food test.I made 5 AP and was about to go and transfer to Jin that there i find out oh shit it cost no AP xD But since my neet was slow and was my last chance i transfered and Run with Cat and Medkit but he dind't got AP so i stayed on Bay but i knowed they would kill me so i simply log out ~.~ But i just go rampage when Ronald ((Jin)) said my transforming was noob <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Come on its true i just played 4 ship until now but my plans was good.Actually i just wanted to finish game fast ^~^ Or i could have been most less suspected guy in there <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><br><br><p>Well i split so many things here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I hope you all die in that ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"> Sorry i really wanted to be a human in there but oh well <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> And i lost another chance to join MS <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><br><br><p>Cheers- Your Gryphon</p>

                <p>I am on this ship. I am very frustrated for reasons touched on in your original post. I'm sorry you became mush, Roland. It became clear you might the one when you hesitated at spending ap on terrence, then confirmed when you tried killing me. Nobody else did anything about you - namely because frieda would have died if anyone acted, and I wanted to go to bed. So everyone else basically let your final rampage happen.</p><p>Public ships are getting really, really depressing go be on.</p>
