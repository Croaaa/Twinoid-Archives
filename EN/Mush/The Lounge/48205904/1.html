Like, we're all about to die from asphyxation, Frieda scans a dozen of planets all of them with volcanoes - and then Paola finds a perfect 2-fuel planet with everything you need for survival from her first (probably; we'll never know the full amount of her work) try.<br>Or how we were getting crappy projects one after other. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It seems that in the end mush Stephen hated me, but it's not true that I've put "everyone" under food tests. And how could we catch you if you did almost nothing mushy? Only by exclusion method! At least it was an active investigation on the human side, and I believe some of us had fun (not only me).</p><p>I'm grateful to everyone who just did their job on this ship, even if they were very silent. I think we did what we could. What do you think?</p>

I TOLD YOU, WE SHOULD HAVE KILLED JIN SU IN THE VERY BEGINNING, IT WOULD GIVE US MORE TIME <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>As for food-tests, it's really questionable case... From one side i feel grateful to Terrence as he rejected to pass this test. It really made me feel he was a mush! it gave me more reasons to be mean with him, to suspect him, and it was fun for me. <br>From other side, in our sleepy kingdom it was more than impossible to understand who is mush, on top of that we lost Chao in the very beginning and Eleesha played role of Christmas tree at lab. Seems you were the only mush-hunter and there was not much you can do....<br>But you know, when i played my first game, mushes managed to convert me on 2nd or 3rd day. In an hour Chun asked me to eat pumpkin and ration and to kill other mush.<br>I guess it was totally unfair, i knew nothing about this game, i did not do anything mushy, so she could easily understand i am a mush by this stupid test. and what could i told to her? "sorry, i can't eat two times. i am a mush, kill me too!"?<br>I wrote about it in mushy-chat and the guy, whom i was supposed to kill, ate my ration, so it helped me to escape this test. but they managed to understand i am a mush by game means, and it was cool! THOUGH THEIR SHIP EXPLODED AND I WAS HAPPY <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>But anyway, no matter what other think, i believe you totally rocked this ship. You were a real engine of our crew. You tried to link us, to coordinate, to make us move in one direction. The main point of the game is communication and you were fully involved in it.<br>And you were really funny <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Thank you for this game! And sorry if i offenced you or anybody else. sometimes i honestly hated you all <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> but sometimes i was playing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Janice here! I tried to get JS to give us time, but our terribly different schedules doomed us, as we weren't able to get consistent relays for RFS! We got it up to ~85%, but JS had to sleep, and we may not have survived long enough to finish it anyway. Chun, the one tip I would say is not to ask folks to do food test- if you ever play as mush it ruins the fun of the game. Either way, though, it was a good ship and I hope to see you both on another!! FYI Chun- join the RP or DIE casting and ready up today if you want to do another ship with us!!</p>

                <p>Thank you for your feedback ppl <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>I was pretty lucky that lots of people ate/were getting sick actively. Or I would probably try to test everyone! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Stephen was able to get away from the food test in an elegant light-hearted manner, and Kimby, you just provided another way to do it. So, I guess, even these are not inevitable. Being tested by killing is the most awful way <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
