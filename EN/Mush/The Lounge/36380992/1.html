                <p>Okay, second idiotic mush here.</p><p>Frist mush killed Chao and stole the pasiphae, never heard from him again. And I (Frieda) killed Janice and pilot Hua. They killed Terrence with their own hands, because Hua thought I transferred from Frieda to Terrence (I don't even know HOW did she think it up). I cried on the main chat that "I'm Terrence, don't kill me", and that was the only thing I ever told them as a mush. I helped them to kill Terrence (they did notice that he was innocent but still didn't kill me) and then wasted Hua after replentishing my ap. Eleesha helped killing Terrence too, and she stayed with me and Hua in one room, it was obvious that I'm a mush but she did nothing. After Hua's death, Kuan Ti finally came and got me fast (I was already wounded because of unlucky blaster shooting).</p><p>Eleesha stated that we're worst mush ever, etc. Other crew members, it seems, didn't like us either.</p><p>Result: no pilot, no scrap collecting = Daedalus pierced lol. Pure mush win.</p><p>I'd really like to know why were you all pissed because I honestly don't understand. Especially goes for Eleesha.</p>

Hua actually kept raging for the following 3 days, it was actually pretty entertaining to see someone getting so worked up for someone using a more than legit tactic in a online game. That said, I was not in that ship and no clue what exactly happened, but seems a simple case of butthurt people.</p>

                <p>Wow, reading that judges last message really made me wonder whether he is suitable for the job. So much butthurt over a lost game? Someone takes it way too serious, and I can only hope its not the same case during the sdf investigations. I don't see anything wrong from the Mush play, atleast the way they have describe it. Humans always should get rid of mush quietly.</p>

                <p>Reading on what happend i have to say its so broken the way mush or griefers can steal items then humans can't do a thing yeah mush goal to wreck things which is fine but fact humans have 0% of doing anything about it... I not angry at players who do this more angry at fact there's not even small % heh i even take 0.1% of having small chance of recovering some of the items mush has stolen or maybe have risk of human who tries to reover items getting killed/Infected or something then what we have now... Meh as for you Borz i was Hua<img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"> and no I bare no grudges and what I said was extreme overreaction hehe least i didnt swear <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> but in the end we where all talking about how such thing should be fixed.</p>

Hua actually kept raging for the following 3 days, it was actually pretty entertaining to see someone getting so worked up for someone using a more than legit tactic in a online game. That said, I was not in that ship and no clue what exactly happened, but seems a simple case of butthurt people.</cite><p>I wasn't on this ship. However! I personally would never use this tactic as a mush. Not because I don't see it as a legitimate tactic - it can certainly be rather efficient. Rather, I find it very boring, and it can really ruin the fun of the human team. There are plenty of mush tactics that are effective and allow the humans a chance at fighting back, which keeps the game fun for both sides. A mush with the pilot skill revealing themselves by running off in the pasiphae with things? There's not really a ton you can do to combat that, if it's the first mushy thing that player does. That being said, this doesn't make it an illegitimate move and when it happens, and I wouldn't rage to see it either. I'd be disappointed, and certainly not impressed at the use of one of the lazier mush strategies, but meh, what can ya do? (Again, keep in mind that's if this is that player's first real move as mush, not if they've played their part <em>then</em> fled. Also not a statement on this ship in specific, since I don't know what that mush did beforehand.)</p>

                <p>But Mightymif, there -are- counterstrategies to item theft. Not perfect ones, but there are choices.</p><p>First off, be alert and aware. Read roomlogs, watch for oddness, and communicate with each other. Even if you don't know who is human yet or not, you can still work as a team. Noticing who is not working with the team can be informative.</p><p>It is vital to know that you have a problem immediately, ideally the cycle it goes wrong. You need to start fixing that problem immediately. Someone needs to follow the trail of the 'wrong-acting person', and different people (to spread out the possible spores) or Chun need to search along it, in case items were just hidden (or some items were just hidden). Know what is lost, then if the 'problem' is that the person ejected from the craft, rejoice because it means that one of the lost items was a spacesuit (right? I've never worn one into space, and I've never had an eject option.... so spacesuits are required for it, right?) so you only lost 2 other more useful items.</p><p>But if there's a chance that person didn't eject, you have a chance to lose nothing at all. You have days for the entire ship to relay in the Nexus, this is probably happening early game, so your entire ship can focus not on problems, but on Projects (with Paola asked to focus with food on Neron upgrades, and perhaps your core research team still focused on anti-mush research).</p><p>Get magnetic Net and move. Before you do, consider trying to talk with your 'problem', if they are a mush, if they do have the communicator still, they might well be willing to 'play'. "Gosh, I sure hope So-and-so doesn't come back and spore me! He's got to have a lot of AP now, all these cycles he's been hiding in that scrapship". If he is mush and doesn't have the communicator, his partner might let him know what's being said, he might get bored himself and want to come see what the ship is doing (after all, until he dies, he canot create a new character, assuming he's a mush and not a cheater who breaks all the rules).</p><p>See if you can catch your 'problem' landing and messing around on the ship again.</p><p>If your ship is not able to organize enough to do this - accept it. Work with what you do have, do what you actually can, and embrace the fact that if it really was crippling, your ship will die sooner, releasing you honorably from a very difficult to play situation. But struggle with it, play with it, try to keep your ship alive and moving towards success no matter what the challenges you face are.</p><p>It can make you a better player, help you see options and ways to be more efficient that you never noticed before, and ultimately improve your future ships, and possibly the future ships of everyone working with you, because they have a chance to learn new things too.</p>

                <p>I think you just have to take it in your stride. I've been on a ship where Chun of all people decided to grief us by running off with the mush sample and plants making us have to hunt her down and kill her and then to add insult to injury not be able to research anything that needed her until we unlocked Chun's ghost (you know how important early research is).</p><p>Despite that huge setback we still got our mush and lived on and had a fruitful voyage.

                <p>Dunno, but odd player. Profile page talks about him being an English mod in about every place possible to put the words.</p><p>His last 8 ships have all been mush wins/human losses, all fairly quick ones, though only one appears to have sparked such great anger in him... there's others where his ending words include 'pathetic' several times and 'coward' once, apparently directed towards the Mush. He was human and not converted for all those ships. The 9th previous ship was a human win, though a late death for him, and he sounded annoyed about that expo death too.</p><p>Mod or not, he sounds pretty darn frustrated.</p>

I'm glad it led to me finding it though, if anyone's still cares, I may have some insight on this ship to share...</p><p>Let me start by saying as I've said a few times before, I find that people that can't handle loosing in a PvP environment like mush are numerous as they are immature and disgusting. I have no respect for them.</p><p>That being said, I happen to be in mush IRC when <span class="tid_user tid_user_1337639 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1337639">DD321123</span> decided he needed to go vent. According to him, the ship was a doomed from the start due to a lack of technicians for PILGRED, which is a very slow and inevitable death indeed. He claims it was not the loss that set him off but the fact that Mushy Su was being extremely presumptuous about the circumstances, attributing the win purely to his own cleverness and human stupidity when the human team had no chance even without mush.</p><p>Of course, this is all second hand meaning what I heard was probably biased and possibly not in fact be the case at all but it brings up a good point: <strong>poor sportsmanship comes in two flavors</strong>. There are sore losers as we've discussed but on the other end of the spectrum, no one likes gloating; no one likes to be repeatedly reminded about their "poor" performance outside of constructive criticism. Whether or not poor performance was exhibited is irrelevant.</p><p>Although, I can't say about the technicians, given that Mushy Su's last words were "<em>I'd like to congratulate myself on a job well done,</em>" I'd imagine that the story on his inflammatory nature isn't too far fetched. From what I gather from the End page, there existed prime examples of each type of poor sportsmanship that round.</p><p>Come on guys, it's just a game. I actually enjoy loosing as a human... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"></p>
