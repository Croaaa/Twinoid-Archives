That took a while, but we survived to day 10 and returned to Sol with the Serum! <br>I was Janice. One of the first things that happened: Gioele went griefer and tried to kill Chun. Luckily, due to an earlier suggestion, she had the armor and survived. After we had killed him, I found a camera that hadn't been installed yet. I asked where it should go, and the Bridge was suggested. A few minutes after I put it up, Raulca asked if she could have it at the engine room. I thought the bridge would be a better choice and suggested that she hid in a rear turret, The kind that nobody ever goes into, and forbade unauthorized entry. It didn't take long for Chao to break this rule twice. The anti-mush committee, composed of Me, Chun, Finola, and Raulca, decided that his days were numbered, and that Hua was looking pretty suspicious too... Of course at around that point, Chao went inactive on the bridge. We were running low on oxygen, And I had a lot of AP, so I took an Astrophysics skill and proceeded to have the worst luck with planets before Freida found one with air and nothing too dangerous. At that point, I had Kuan-Ti move the ship with the hacker kit. However, when he went to pick it up, he injured himself and died. At this point, Raulca came by and used it to move us to a planet, while Finola and Chun continued their research. However, I had noticed that a raw ration in the hall that had been dropped by Hua, which I had been clear NOT TO EAT for fear of a trap, had vanished when Finola picked it up. Upon asking her, she revealed that she had immediately become a mush upon consumption, not knowing that rations could be trapped multiple times. She promised to hold off the parasite, presumably not realizing it was against the rules. She also revealed who the other two mush were (Chao and Hua), and that Chao had spored Raulca twice.As I was presently unable to do anything else, I reported her and moved on...although I was unaware of the PM reporting bug. Sorry SDF!<br>Me and Chun eventually decided to suggest she go on the expedition, assuming Hua would come in and pilot it early, ruining everything with Traitor and presumably killing someone, hopefully Finola so we wouldn't have to deal with the whole awkward "Mush wants to help" thing. Everything went as planned... except for the fact that nobody died and the alpha mush had been killed. That was pretty good, but not what we had been hoping for. So, Finola worked with Chun on the retro-fungal Serum while we tried to complete Pilgred and overall not die. at this point, the only living people were Me, Chun, Finola, Raulca, Ian, Roland, inactive and good at not dying Terrence, and Freida. At that point I was a shrink, and the holder of both Neron Admin and Comms Officer, with Freida being the captain. After a while we completed Pilgred and the serum, as Finola committed suicide by picking something up and dropping it repeatedly, and Terrence starved. I would have reported her again, but figured one report was enough. Freida suggested we try to make it to day 10, believing we would totally survive that long. At first, me, Chun, and Raulca were against it, but then Roland told me about a "Nice EXP bonus" which sold me over. Actually we did make it quite easily, despite a scare with a few meteors and making the jump while Roland was outside. Apparently, there was no EXP bonus, but we made it anyway.

                <p>Chun reporting in.</p><p>From the outset, things were looking to be interesting. Gioele seemed to have suffered some kind of mental breakdown after being woken up from cryo and attacked me right at the start of Day 2. Finola was using the Medlab bed to sleep in, so I ended up taking a bed in Alpha Dorm, the same dorm Gioele had decided on using. He attacked me while I slept, and if Janice hadn't recommended I take the armour, I'd have been killed on Day 2 which would have completely derailed the mission. As soon as I realised what had happened, I freaked out and fled to the Medlab to heal up, despite some pretty horrendous injuries. Once I felt safe, I announced what had happened, and not long later Roland took care of Gioele for us. Turned out Gioele was still human! That early event pretty much set the tone for me for this mission. Every decision I made was done primarily for my own survival.</p><p>I kept to myself and our research a lot. I didn't really know all too much of what was going on in the ship. I was moving from the Lab to Alpha Dorm and back again to continue research. It went a lot slower than I had intended. I noticed, however, there were a couple of incidents involving Chao and Raluca. It was after that where the Anti-Mush Committee was formed. We had all voiced our suspicions, and after pooling our knowledge and observations, we pretty much came to the consensus that Chao and Hua were the Mush. Chao had made the mistake of entering the "Raluca Cave" more than once which made us suspicious. Hua on the other hand just hadn't been moving around the ship as we would expect, and it wasn't simply a case of appearing to be an inexperienced crew member. Janice noticed the cooked ration that Hua had left outside the Refectory which was also pretty... suspect.</p><p>Apparently our suspicions weren't universal, however. It turned out that Finola had fallen for the trap and ate the ration, instantly transforming her. However, she "fought" the infection hard. I didn't realise this right away, and it was only until Janice had told me privately what had transpired. This meant that the Retro-Fungal Serum became our new priority. Also by this point a fire had broken out in the Refectory at this point and we lost 10 rations.</p><p>Unfortunately I had other, more immediate plans. After it was confirmed by our Mush double-agent that Chao and Hua were the alphas, I had to protect myself and the crew. But mostly myself. Firstly, Janice and I started deciding what to do with Finola. We needed that Serum to complete the mission, but it was clear that Finola was the only one able to make good progress on it. However, we also needed to get her out of the picture. Multiple scenarios went through my head. At the time we had discovered a planet that had some much needed oxygen and food. I thought that it would be a win-win situation if we put Hua and Finola on the mission. If either of them were killed, we'd have less mush to worry about. If not, then we'd have food and oxygen. Roland and Ian also went on the mission, which made me apprehensive about it, but as I've said earlier, I was more concerned about my own safety rather than anyone else's.</p><p>Chao was a real threat to me, despite the armour. I had reasoned that if Gioele could almost kill me while I was wearing armour, that psychopath Chao would be capable. So I had to strike first. While the away mission was in progress, I ran to the Bridge and pummelled him to death. Something inside me broke that instant, and I wanted to end the Mush threat as soon as possible. As I had exhausted myself, I couldn't finish the job, as much as I felt I needed to. Our ulterior motive for the away mission to try and end up with Hua or Finola dead didn't pan out as we had hoped. I therefore privately messaged Frieda, telling her that Hua needed to die. With my mind shattered by having been attacked by one person, and having killed someone else, my message didn't come through clearly and Frieda was hesitant at first. She caught on with what I had said and she did what was needed to be done and finished off Hua.</p><p>Then things were calm. Aside from the frequent Hunter attacks, fires breaking out across the ship, and most of the crew dying from inactivity. From this point, it was a rush to finish the Serum, and deal with Finola. I wasn't sure what I was going to do. Use the Serum on her as soon as it was finished? Kill her? I didn't know. While I was trying to research and decide what to do, the rest of the crew were trying to keep the ship from falling apart and were deciding whether we'd be able to survive for 10 days in space before returning to Sol.</p><p>One morning, I woke from having fallen asleep against the Lab's shelving unit to find that Finola had killed herself. Shrödinger had claimed another victim. And the Serum was 1% from being complete! So I finished it off. After finishing that, I finished off a couple of other research projects that had been partially completed, then turned my efforts to trying to help the rest of the crew keep the Daedalus together. Apparently I had been so concerned about surviving that I missed a suicide note written on a post-it. Raluca found it in Medlab which she had taken over as her resting spot. That was pretty sad. Your last words, written on a post-it note. Wow. That's desperation right there.</p><p>Despite my intention to help the crew put out fires, fix things, and the like, I never really had the energy to do any of it. But Raluca got beaten up pretty bad by angry machinery she was trying to fix, and the Daedalus itself trying to kill her as the hull struggled to maintain its integrity. So I did what I could to keep her alive. Fortunately that was something I was good at. Also by this point, Raluca and I were suffering from panic attacks. It seemed like I was suffering from them a lot more, though. Janice was kind enough to help me through them though, and was instrumental in keeping me from losing it.</p><p>The last few cycles were torturous. I picked up a pilot manual to learn the basics of flying a fighter craft, and went into space to try and hold off the Hunter threat. I was able to hit one of them, but it turns out that I'm not a natural at fighting. Fancy that! So I stayed in space to gather myself, and to present the enemy with another target to shoot at. Surviving that, Roland soon joined me again in space, so I landed to recover from the ordeal. Time was drawing near that we needed to jump back to Sol. I took the hacker kit to the Bridge in case our acting captain - Frieda - wasn't capable of jumping.</p><p>Day 10. Cycle 1. Roland was stuck in space. Frieda tried to help him by taking out the asteroids that were threatening the ship and buying him time to get aboard. I had jacked into the Command Console, and was ready to hit the button to jump to Sol at a moment's notice. I pleaded with Roland to get back aboard the Daedalus.</p><p>No answer but I knew he was out there still.</p><p>I ran calculations in my head. I ran what-if scenarios. I figured at the rate we were getting attacked, and the damage from the fires and internal failures were doing, we could survive one more cycle.</p><p>Again, I tried to raise Roland and get him to land. I tried so hard. I was crying and begging for him to get back aboard.</p><p>Cycle 2. Nothing. The ship was hurt badly. We couldn't keep this ship together any longer. I waited for as long as I could. Longer than I should have. Roland, you bastard! My saviour at the start of the mission. The hero who kept the Hunters off us for 10 days. I didn't want to leave you! This was the worst practical joke he had played on me! It had to be! 30 minutes remained before Cycle 3 would be upon us, but my nerves were shot. I was worn out, I was losing my sanity if I hadn't already lost it. I had to jump us out to Sol.</p><p>I don't know what happened. I didn't know if Roland knew or not. Apparently, engaging PILGRED caused Roland's patrol craft to return to the ship and he had returned to Sol with us. It was over. We could cure the Mush infection. We had a shot at saving Sol!</p><p>Mission over. I need therapy. Chun out.</p><p><em>I had a real blast with this mission. There was definitely a few good stories to be told about this mission, despite some very dubious moments. For myself, it was a story of panic and a downward spiral into madness. Over 10 days, I pretty much became a cross between Joan Lambert from Alien to the new incarnation of Lara Croft.<br><br>This was pretty hectic from the outset for me. First time playing as Chun. First time a ship I was on was able to reach Sol! I learnt a lot about the character and the game. The patrol craft thing at the end was particularly odd. If I had known that, I'd have jumped sooner. I wanted to keep Roland alive as he had done so much for us, and I didn't want him missing out on a Day 10 completion. Despite some rather dubious Mush play from Finola, it did create some drama for us human players. Sorry to the Alpha Mush this game. If it's any consolation, Finola told us what we had already known and you guys were marked for death before she had her... double-turncoat moment. Gioele on the other hand was an ass and clearly a griefer. <br><br>Wow! I wrote a lot!</em> <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/surprise.gif" alt=":anim_surprised:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Same here. The surviving crew were pretty good. With so many inactives on the ship, I really wasn't expecting to get as far as we did. Still, Frieda, Raluca, and Roland did a good job of convincing me otherwise. Janice was instrumental in keeping me alive. Raluca was a star, rushing around and fixings things as they broke. Roland did a great job keeping the Hunters to a minimum. Frieda did a great job plugging the gaps. Ian was very quiet though from my perspective. Me on the other hand, wasn't the most effective member on board. I know I could've spent my AP a lot more effectively as I spent most of the game running around like a headless chicken and freaking out.</p><p>Perhaps if we had one or two more active crew mates, we'd have done even better? Who knows!</p>

You seemed to have a hand in everything! Most energetic old lady ever!</p><p>The Finola incident was really weird. It was pretty cool to "RP" the situation. I'm not sure if I could consider what I was doing was RP or not. It was half and half I think.
