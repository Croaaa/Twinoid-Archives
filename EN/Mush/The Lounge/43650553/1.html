                <p>Boy oh boy!</p><p>Andie here, in this mush-riddled ship. <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6452" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6452</a></p><p>The ship started out favourably enough! Most seemed active and chatty. Only Frieda and Derek were non-participants. Raluca had brought her talking cat and Stephen was ready and willing to fondle the inventory.</p><p>Shortly after my first day of SCIENCE I settled down in Medbay for a rest. Unfortunately, I was visited by the ghosts of mushmas past and present, and became the ghost of mushmas future. I thought I would almost certainly be killed when Chun arrived in medbay next.</p><p>Cycles went by, and when i awoke, both Chun and Hua had come and gone. None said anything about the visitation in the room. Hua, I found out, hadn't even looked at the logs for reasons. I was in the clear.</p><p>Jin su died because he refused to go on an expo. That was pretty dumb, Jin su, and from the sound of your exit message it doesn't seem like you learned anything from the experience. Try harder.</p><p>Soon I got an excuse to be dirty and coughed up a pair of spores. We'd meant to convert another person that day, but I slept in hard. A day later, we arranged for a defacing in alpha dorm and took on Hua, who seemed to be one of the ones more competently looking for signs of mushiness. The Alpha dorm defacing involved me going to AD after Ian had spiked, and really, may or may not have worked without one of us getting dead. As it turns out there seemed to be just enough confusion that none of us got lynched.</p><p>Around this time, Raluca started getting chased around with Chun, who was trying to kill her. Her reasons were not at all coherent and eventually she was <em>quarantined</em> midship because of her behavior. First time I've ever seen that happen.</p><p>After that, it was trying to angle for the next conversion. Eleesha ended up sleeping in alpha dorm, and as wse prepared for an expo to a planet with volcano and seismic (a <em>human</em> brought us here!), we eventually decided to try the old trick again, defacing and converting, knowing full well if anyone noticed it would be no mistaking who was involved. As it turns out, the remaining humans seemed pretty groggy and unreactive and continud relaying neron. After I went to sleep, a big ol' rampage happened, but I wasn't part of that - out in space carrying two blasters as I was. I leave that part of the story to someone else..</p><p>As for the title, as it happened, this ship was at least half composed of people from IRC! Either the #Mush-EN or the irc channel for the TE casting! At least six of us just happened to all get placed in this ship, well, neat!</p><p>Fin (cleanup later. z.z)</p>

                <p>Raluca here.</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Like Andie said, the ship started off well with actives. I spent most of my time in the turrets so I didn't entirely know what was going on. Quite early on Roland walked into my turret by accident, and I was worried that I was spored, but I decided that to prevent double sporing I'd go to Bravo Dorm where Janice was and sleep through day change.<br><br>I also worked on the NERON Projects, and Schro was chatting happily with everyone. It was all going fine, until Jin-Su decided to fly off in a patrol ship. After everyone else went on the expedition, we took a vote to abandon Jin-Su. After agreeing with 7-1, Eleesha took the hacker kit and abandoned him.<br><br>Chun was angry that Eleesha took the hacker kit, and we argued with her that she should of been holding it. I asked her what she was holding, and she said she had the blaster because she wanted to murder someone.<br><br>At the day change of day 4-5, I was sleeping in Bravo Dorm, and Chun came in and used the soap, which meant she was dirty. When I checked she had the sprinter book. I asked her why and she refused to answer and she started arguing with Terrence because we said he should get the magebook. I was worried that she was dirty because she could of been shooting someone with that blaster. Things eventually heated up about me missing AP and she shot me, so I bolted out of the room looking for Ian who was in Alpha Dorm. Because Chun was Bronze and she dropped her Tracker for the Blaster, she couldn't find me. Eventually she gave up and went to the Bridge, where she was quarantined.<br><br>At day 6, Gioele took us to expedition on a planet with a Volcanoe, Seismic activity, and an unkown zone that he didn't analyze. I don't think anyone ever went on the expedition, but people started dying pretty quickly, and I lost 7 morale in total. We were going to lose, but Terrence had a plan. He would give me gold days, I would become a genius and finish the cure, Roland would kill the mush, we'd finish PILGRED and return to Sol, victoriously!<br><br>However, I noted that Roland wasn't awake at the time, so instead he had me wheel him around to a patrol ship with some oxygen so he could outlive the mush. I joined him too.<br><br>I don't know where Terrence is, but right now, me and Schro are flying around space, going on adventures. One day we will find Eden and populate the planet with werecats, and fight off the mush menace once and for all.</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Raluca, <strong>AWAAAAY</strong>! <em>Woosh!</em></span><br>Also, I don't think we ever found my missing AP.</p>

                <p>Hi, your friendly neighborhood alpha mush Ian here! Take some valerian, sit down and listen to my story of how we eradicated humanity.</p><p>I was only level 9 silver, but Stephen, my trusty sidekick, was level 14 gold. He picked Mycelium Spirit and Fertile and we went on a merry conversion spree. Day 2, I went for the classic "I forgot to drop the apron and got dirty from research", then quietly disappeared through the Medlab, where Andie was sleeping. Stephen did the same shortly afterwards and no one was the wiser, except Andie.<br> <br>We were quietly hoping nobody would notice. Chun walked through once, then the damn Medlab door broke for no reason at all and Hua went in to fix it. Clearly, she must have seen the logs. At the same time, she stopped responding to me in a bantering PM we had. We started preparing for the worst.</p><p>Stephen and I made emergency rampage plans, expecting Hua, Chun and co. to be saving up AP to kill us in one fell swoop. It was a time of great worry and distress. Then Andie woke up and turned out to be level 14 gold as well. We lied low, I tended to the plants, nobody came to kill us, and we prepared for the next conversion. Target: Hua.</p><p>Before we got to Hua, however, something strange happened: the discovery of a new kind of space brain virus. On the following morning, the crew was ready to go on expedition. People were ready in Icarus Bay, waiting for our dear captain Jin Su to join them. He, however, refused. He seemed feverish, he had illusions of grandeur and was suffering from paranoia at the same time. This expedition would clearly be a trap of the mush, and there was no way he would step into a room with two strangers.<br>We tried words. We threatened violence. But he would not give in so easily, not he, the great Kim Jin Su, captain of the Daedalus. He was forced into a corner, but he would not surrender to the mush. Seeing no other option, he diverolled into a nearby patroller and took off, never to be seen again. The mush would not get him, he thought to himself. Not this time. During this, someone found the hacker kit lying around in the lab, and it was consequently decided to do the expo without our dear captain while guarding the front corridor with 6 people (better safe than sorry!), and to leave him behind.</p><p>After we did so, Chun suddenly came to life. And what a life it was. An intense, murderous fire was burning within her, and she demanded to know why somebody had picked up the hacker kit without asking her. She was questioned as to why she was not holding the hacker kit, and she declared that she had to carry a blaster because she wanted to kill people. Her rage was growing by the minute and it seemed unstoppable. She started wildly accusing everyone of different things, then finally decided to find Raluca, to make an example of her, to end her once and for all for her disobedience. Raluca, however, noticed the sudden pain of stab wounds and ran to me so I would protect her, Chun chasing wildly after her. Unfortunately, she had dropped her tracker and was unable to locate Raluca. Frustrated, she ran to the bridge to let her anger out on the astro terminal, who's previous owner, a certain Frieda Bergmann, was drooling in the corner. Again and again she punched the buttons on the terminal, but failure after failure only made her more and more furious. Her previously pale and beautiful face became a darker and darker shade of red, her features twisted into an unspeakable grimace of wrath. For a second, she glowed white hot, then melted into a puddle on the floor. She was struck by sudden divine intervention, for her anger was threatening to end the universe.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hua had seemingly been one of the most active mush hunters on board. She had also been in the Medlab, and was surely part of some insider mush hunting chat or other. She was sleeping peacefully next to me in alpha dorm. I was going to deface the logs and spore her, then Andie would finish her off. Unexpectedly, Hua walked away, but Eleesha came in to take her place. She would be a good target as well, as she has control over the list, and was the other most active mush hunter. Everything was in place, we were ready to strike... but Andie slept in. So, no conversion for that day, and I tended to the plants and saved my AP.</p><p>The next day, however, we were able to execute the plan successfully. She was sleeping in alpha dorm with Terrence and me, and Janice was hanging out as well. I defaced, spored Hua, then pretended to notice a sudden defacing and ran to the other dorm, where I stealth showered. Andie then went in to confirm the defacing and fed the remaining two spores to her. Janice and Andie also ran to bravo dorm, Terrence was off to the lab, and Hua was still sleeping peacefully. Success!</p><p>Following these events, the rest of the humans started devolving. They were confused, helpless, and unable to decide on a course of action, so they did what every normal human being in their situation would do: relay NERON and accuse each other wildly. Terrence started becoming trigger happy and advocated killing everyone who had been in the dorm, including himself, to rid the ship of the menace. However, everyone else collectively decided that his cunning plan was not thought all the way through and dismissed it. No one noticed that I had not done any work on research in a while, and so the following day we turned Eleesha in the same way as Hua. We now had five agents on our side, and it was time for the humans to make their last stand.</p><p>Andie had collected both blasters, and would for sure be killed, so she grabbed the blasters and took off in the Pasiphae, with the possible plan of returning later with more AP. However, our new captain Gioele logged in and moved the ship to a planet with a volcano, a seismic zone, deserts and predators, but also much needed oxygen. He forgot to check if anyone had taken off before moving the ship and was delighted to find he had accidentally killed one of ours. But he would not be happy for long. To avenge our comrade, we took everything he loved. His daughter was carrying the knife, and in front of his helpless eyes, we took it from her cold dead hands. He could only watch as Janice, Kuan-Ti and Derek fell in rapid succession. Finally, we decided to show mercy and end his suffering as well.</p><p>At this point Terrence panicked, and he hatched a brilliant plan which he shared with Raluca and Schrödinger: they would steal the last of the O2 and hide in the safety of a patrol ship, leaving us to suffocate while the ship was held down by an Arack. Stephen and Hua were ready to move the ship the following cycle, but one of us would suffocate. I loaded one fuel and found myself in the engine room with 8 AP. I walked into rear alpha turret, took aim at the Arack. And missed. And missed. And missed. Then, I hit him, but the turret was depleted. With the last of my energy, I dragged myself to the opposing turret and rotated the cannon into position. <br>I had three tries. He had three armor. Failure was not an option. One shot. Miss. Another shot. A graze. He was hurt, but had one last point of armor. I prayed to the gods of mushrooms and banana trees. I pulled the trigger. In my adrenaline rush, I watched the shot travel in slow motion and miss the Arack by meters. <br>This was it. We had lost. But as I was falling back into the turret's seat, the shot hit a passing piece of space junk. The debris shot out like shrapnel and perforated the Arack's hull easily. It disintegrated before my wide, unbelieving eyes. <br>We had done it. We had done it! Now, we could move the ship on the following cycle, murder Roland, the last human who was out of AP from unwisely trying to fight back, and take over the Sol system.</p><p>I was relieved. And I was exhausted. I suddenly felt very tired. Closing my eyes in the turret's seat, I smiled. Finally I could sleep the eternal sleep of the just, the conqueror, the legend.</p><p>~*~</p><p>And that's pretty much what happened the following cycle after I suffocated and NERON quarantined the remaining mush. Or so he thinks...</p>

                <p>Hua here!</p><p>This is one of the best ships I've had in a while, and while I was trying to avoid it while human, thanks to the mush team for making me one of your own! Had I taken the time to read the medlab logs when I accidentally entered after they converted Andie, this may have gone a lot differently. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I know I was a bit cranky and easily frustrated on this ship, and for that you all have my sincere apologies. I got sick shortly after jumping, and I have very little patience with myself or anyone else while running a fever with the flu. I hope you all know I truly enjoyed playing with you, and that if I was snippy, it wasn't personal.</p><p>For everyone who was concerned over the fact that Chun got quarantined, if you see her rather hateful last words, I think it was beyond well deserved.</p><p>Jin Su, if you read this, I hope that you will take the time to read up on common practices for Jin Su. I'm sorry if you thought we were being unfair, but it's important to know what's expected of a character before you take it. The forums are awesome for information on each character and how to play them. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Overall, this was a really good ship. I wish I could have done more for both sides while I represented them, but I really appreciate the opportunity to see two mush wreak absolute havoc and convert half of the crew, giving me excellent ideas for the next time a mushroom takes over my brain! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
