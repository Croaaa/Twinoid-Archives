                <p>Gioele here, well it was an irritating ship at first, Being one of the only competent members, The other smart people getting killed without notice in the mush hunt.</p><p>I'll go into detail as much as I can. Eleesha being a newbie printed The List, at the first opportunity. Prompting rage from many of the crew(Myself included), I was willing to let her be a noob while showing her around a little, but Roland killed her.<br> Then I being the good Gioele I was, demanded an explanation. Roland said he thought she was a mush because she patrolled the ship, seeming to be a good player before selection and than made a newbie mistake after selection. In my eyes his reasoning was decent but he wasn't smart enough to get some backup on it. I went to sleep IRL, and woke up to him dead. <br>As it turns out Frieda thought his over aggressiveness was him being mush. So she killed him despite Terrence saying that he probably wasn't mush, and he really wasn't. Frieda had eaten some Organic waste for Ap and dipped into demoralization.</p><p>But then Kuan Ti whos AP had been undocumented, trapped me once(I actually don't know where), spiked me(while I was trying to get us quick O2 with capsules from the salvage of hunters), then trapped me again(While I was checking Pilgred for secretly being maxed). This made me a mush because. Our Finola being AFK had done the Mush a great service in gettting me to waste AP killing her as she was one of the alpha mushes. (She had been plated and roomshook, so I expected her to be the first to starve, she instead didn't starve at all.)<br> And all this while our morale died by quarantine or starvation, and Raluca died of double teamster with Janice. So far we are two Mush to five Humans, I'm in high spirits, am hard boiled, have a knife, and am expecting to get alot done with a good rampage.</p><p>Later I attacked Chao, to inspire an attack on me by the remaining humans. Only one needs to die in order to doom this ship.<br>He then died of depression, I guess he figured out I was a mush and gave up all hope.</p><p>Kuan Ti then transferred to Hua. Gofig.<br>Aaaand then Hua died of morale loss, what a shame.<br>Then I'm just waiting for the AP to cut a bloody swath.<br>I found Chun Mutated AAAAND. I missed.</p><br><p>The Ship is Here: (<a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7365)" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7365)</a></p>

It's an important long term decision I would like your input. Or should we make Terrence one of Biologist or Astro, and make me our second tech? ~18h<br>Terrence : I don't think I need another skill. I drastically lack pa to do what I can already. <br>Astro since I screwed up screwing Frieda (pun not intended) ~18h<br>Gioele : If I became a tech I could do the job allowing you to move less often while I have AP to spare for it. Then all you'd need is to move into the correct room. ~18h<br>Terrence : Maybe you're right.

Are you a newbie aren't you ?! ~2d<br>Eleesha : Well yes this is my second game my first one a guy killed me for suspicion i was mush because\ i got hurt by falling metal and shakeing ~2d<br>Frieda : then if you're a newbie, don't do any thing without asking the pros ! Printing the list in D2 is a HUGE WASTE !!!!!! . It should be printed in D7 Or to know when we are mush free !!! ~2d<br>Frieda : I'm outta here fp <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> . What a waste of time out ~2d<br>Eleesha : Oh f*** just looked on the wiki about this...... well... ~2d<br>Eleesha : Youre very nice to new players you now what i'll just stop playing im free to kill as im done. It''s better then a "pro" quiting ~2d<br>Gioele : A very correct statement Eleesha, being a member of Schrodingers Army I view giving up just because a ship is hard as a show of general inferiority. ~2d<br>Roland : I wont say she is a noob, her actions, the way she explored the ship, the way she talked, those no noob actions ~2d<br>Gioele : Alright cool so Eleesha may want to food test to keep off the public shit list. However Frieda seems to have quit, as such I will quote the rules as read in the forums. "The other type of inactivity that can be reported is surrender or giving up. For example, a player has had a disagreement on the ship and stops playing. This is not allowed, ships must be played out." ~2d<br>Frieda : Lolz I'm not quitting , I just said I'm just out of such argument ! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> out ~2d<br>Frieda : this crew doesn't really know how to read between the line . fp ~2d<br>Gioele : I'm basically a hermit, and am on the autism spectrum, I have to take everything literally. Reading between the lines will cause serious misinterpretation. Adding to that I view assumptions as the source of all mistakes. ~2d<br>Frieda : well then if you already reported me , it's ok . It's not my fault. I'm not quitting, and reporting someone in doing a thing he didn't even do will be turn out against you . Good Luck ! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> ~2d<br>Gioele : It only ends badly if I was actually abusing the report system, If I had a viable reason to report even if it was a misconception then I won't actually get in trouble. Good thing I waited to confirm that you did in fact leave. On another note your negative attitude might be enough for a report, I'm hoping your just in a bad mood and it clears up. Also if Eleesha did this on purpose then we could report her. Suicide is a crime in mush after all."</cite></p><p><span class="tid_preCite">I knew he was mush, I said he was mush, many things point to him being mush.

It's (more or less) not infected in AD, since Roland who brought it here was human.
