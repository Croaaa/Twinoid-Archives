                <p>This ship just returned to Sol:</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5769" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5769</a></p><p>Lady Luck had some kind of vendetta against the Mush team on this ship. Everything that could possibly go wrong for them did, starting with the selection of Frieda and Paola.</p><p>Frieda rampaged shortly after selection, killing Chun and and Terrence, kidnapping Schr√∂dinger, and hijacking the Pasiphae with the Soap and Medikit. Our very next project was Magnetic Net.... <em>Poor Frieda.</em></p><p>The next couple days were suspenseful, since Paola was laying low. The only Comms work I remember her doing was a single upgrade: Plasma Shield. <em>(Oops!)</em></p><p>A few cycles later she stumbled into Beta Dorm and started punching Janice, who was wearing the Armor... right next to Ian.</p><p>And thus ended the Mush hunt. It was pretty anti-climactic.</p><p>Over the next few days, we developed the cure and expo'd a couple planets. Our stats and resources were great. But without an Astrophysicist, we didn't have much chance of getting to Eden. We stuck it out to Day 11, and we could have gone a lot longer, but we decided to head home and call it a win.</p><p>Eleesha, Hua, and Janice were very experienced, and I learned several things from each of them - especially Eleesha.</p><p>Raluca's quirky role-play was fantastic, always talking to her cat "Schroddie" and banging things with her magical wrench. I had a lot of fun playing with you, Raluca!</p><p>Kuan Ti was a badass cigar-smoking nihilist who strangely loitered unprotected in the Nexus, but obviously knew how to play the game quite well. You were a lot of fun too, KT!</p><p>I was your flamboyant Andie who would never shut up. I had a great time role-playing with all of you.</p>

                <p>Janice here!. Don't really have much to add to the well written summary of the ship other than the fact that we got lucky getting magnetic net so we could get Frieda back on the ship and kill her without losing anything. <br>I loved the roleplay that was going on, especially between Andie and Raluca. Getting Kuan Ti's autograph was pretty funny too, then it burning up in the fire afterward. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> I would have been more active in the roleplay aspect, but I'm just not very good at that.<br>We returned to Sol at the right time IMO. As I stated before, we didn't have a high probability of going to Eden and ships can start to get harder and harder to manage very fast as the days progress. We would all spend most of our AP fixing things and putting out fires.<br>I do hope to see most of you again sometime.</p>

                <p>Hello there, your cat-girl here! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Sorry I could not show too much of sympathy in-game as Raluca (understandable I hope), but I really enjoyed our trip. I wanted to be very strict and annoying first but after Chun did take my cat back who was immediately kidnapped short after, I decided to go little bit crazy about it and it worked! Haha, it was fun to try something new in roleplay again <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> (shame Chun did not survive longer)</p><p>Mush were not very entertaining, indeed. Poor Paola looked to me like newer player left behind by aggro Frieda.</p><p>Don't worry brother, you were cool! I always like Ian's with own style and charm and your posts were pleasure to read. Could not test your other "qualities" but... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> those bananas were yummy!</p><p>Thank you for your care and support, Janice, I really appreciated it - I did not have to hug my dear Schroddie for a whole game! After first rebel base, my morale was on top almost all the time.</p><p>Speaking about rebel bases, Eleesha was awesome! I was worried, we won't have much done with dead Paola. She even managed to finish all Comms together with a lot of other stuff, helped us a LOT.</p><p>Kuan! I wish you were able to speak and play more often, smoking man. Haven't seen more enjoyable roleplay for KT before, my deep respect.</p><p>Roland &amp; Hua, pew pew pew... our awesome Pilots. We were swimming in scrap and although we went down with Plasma shield several times, overall status was still great, thank you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Commander, you were silent - but effective. Maybe not very good in English, or? But anyway, pleasure to have you around.</p><p>And special thanks to ... Andie!<br>I loved your roleplay, your stories and your arguing with me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"> Our good soul of Daedalus.</p><p>Ship without Astrophysicist is crap. Poor Hua &amp; Janice, I bet you wanted to do a lot more expeditions. We were in very good shape for such a small team but I am glad we went home before we have to only heal, repair and extinguish fires each cycle. The Sprinter book ended like a perfect solution for me: I could do a lot of moving, even managed to brew many cups of coffee and still have something extra for the repairs <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I hope I see you soon on some of my next ships. Looking forward to!</p>

Then Janice was like, "Oh, next you'll want his autograph." That was too hilarious to pass up, so I turned it into gushing fanboyism and chased KT around the ship with the Post-its, begging him to sign one for me.

You did an <em>excellent</em> job with the gardening, and your pacifist role-play was a lot of fun too. I liked how you reluctantly carried the knife and wished to destroy the terrible instrument of death. Then when I was waiting for you to leave the dorm so I could kill Paola, you serenely decided it was a good time to check on the plants and "accidentally" dropped the knife before you left.<br>Well played. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_15645 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="15645">Vidriel</span></span><cite>Thank you for your care and support, Janice, I really appreciated it - I did not have to hug my dear Schroddie for a whole game!

In retrospect, one thing kinda stood out to me - little or no DTT. I never even gave or received a flirt.

I was worried, we won't have much done with dead Paola. She even managed to finish all Comms together with a lot of other stuff, helped us a LOT.</cite><br>I know! Eleesha was on top of <em>everything!</em> I could tell she was geared up for an intense Mush hunt, and then it turned out to be a big let-down. At least she got some good use out of her Tracker skill by efficiently locating where Chun had hidden the Hacker Kit. This was so epic, I had to get a screenshot:</p><p><a href="http://postimg.org/image/t4i8idctp/" target="_blank">http://postimg.org/image/t4i8idctp/</a></p><p>Then she completely finished every bit of Comms down to the last upgrade that was worth doing, and became our primary amateur Astrophysicist. She also schooled me on the game mechanics about half a dozen times, which was very helpful - this was only my 5th game, so I still have some things to learn.</p><p>Thanks for everything, Eleesha. You rock.</p><br><p>Lots of other great moments on this ship. An excellent and fun crew. Wish we could have made it to Eden, but I'm glad we ended where we did, before it became frustrating futility. I'd love to play with all of you again.</p>

                <p>Janice has one real job and that is to keep morale up. It is honestly not a hard job to do and it's frustrating when an incompetent Janice is on a ship not knowing what to do and not caring about the morale of others because the job is so easy.</p>
