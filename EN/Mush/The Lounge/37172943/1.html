                <p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3382" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3382</a></p><p>Don't be fooled by that little mushy Eleesha down there, last in the rankings with 0 glory.</p><p>Or by the huge glory of human Jin Su, three times as much as anyone else as he sits there first on the page.</p><p>Oh no, that does nothing but obscure this ship's story; nothing but underline and highlight how <strong>one mush alone</strong> destroyed us, and how very effectively and completely.</p><p>I was Janice, 4th level, and I think I'm pretty good. I've been to Eden twice on random ships; I like to teach and teambuild and I love the game.</p><p>Many of our ship were first time newbies. Almost all were bronze. When I got onto the ship, roughly 2/3rds full already, there were several hello threads and some pleasant chatter, but none of the common utility threads (inventory, research, dirty, projects and the like), so I got busy. I inventoried the storerooms, installed cameras in both dorms, noted the initial project choices (and that 2 players had started to work on one without saying a word about it.... but happily they picked the one that I would have voted for), made the utility threads...</p><p>Silver Stephen came aboard and was talking, active, experienced, and wondering who to apprentice to. [Note to self and Stephen; if we ever see that situation again, you need to run to Raluca and apprentice Physicist superfast, heh! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">]</p><p>Once the ship filled and mush were chosen, Stephen also announced that Jin Su was killing people already. And how. It didn't look deadly or super effective to me at first. I low AP from my initial errands and snug in a dorm, but the lab was crowded, like 7 people there. Jin had ran for the grenade, used it, punched some.... no one died. Stephen killed Jin, who was proven human... and that's when Stephen wondered, wait, Transfer? And noticed that Eleesha, who had Tracker skill, no longer had any skills.</p><p>But Stephen used all AP to kill Jin. Our newbie Chun came online around then, wanting to research, we urged her to get out and stay out of the lab. Maybe I should have urged her to punch Eleesha for all she was worth, but I didn't think Eleesha would die that easily, and.... And almost everyone was offline, and for that matter, I could only invite 7 people to a PM. No one online could do anything about Eleesha right then.</p><p>So Eleesha had stood there for a time after the transfer, then went for the grenade BP, made it, and returned to the lab. Grenade 2 broke Gravity Simulator, Research Terminal, the connecting door to medlab, and killed 2 who still stood in medlab. Eleesha had the AP to finish a third kill. Someone finished killing Eleesha, wounds finished killing another who'd stood in the lab. 6 deaths, all before day change. And it was C8.</p><p>I'm gold, I'd hugged the cat before the ship filled; I was going to survive. But almost everyone was bronze or silver, no sol connection yet. I'd only managed to spend one cycle change in a bed beside Hua and Roland. We had 2 people standing in nexus, 3 in my dorm, 3 in the other dorm.... and the other dorm had Stephen and Chun. I used the mission Stephen was able to give me, comforted Hua and Roland once, got a ration, comforted Stephen, Chun, and Frieda once, and held on for dear life.</p><p>By D2C2 only 7 were alive, myself and the 5 I'd comforted.... and Ian, who still stood in Medlab. He'd never hugged the cat, we had no D1 bananas and he'd not moved, so at least we knew who the second mush was. He'd also found his talkie that game, but had dropped it at some point.</p><p>So Stephen apprenticed my IT skill; we finished Oxygenated ducts, to have a chance with air; we found our pilot starting skill book (drat!); we discussed the rush to finish Pilgred with just 6 of us, and how only 4, given we had no tech or physicist alive could finish pilgred in about 2.5 days given 2 meals and total AP spent on Pilgred resets; we discussed how we would get 2 skillbooks from comms and it could be tech, physicist, or even tech and phys.</p><p>We talked about natamy rifle for Stephen, and how we could even potentially complete the cure.</p><p>Everyone's morale got stabilized; I adopted the two plants early and ate all bananas to stabilize mine; we got sol connected too.</p><p>And then Hua, who had never spoken, logged in and killed Roland, still without a word. Hua had her talkie, was part of the PMs, had every reason to understand the situation. Reported of course; judge ye well oh judges. But now we were 4 humans and 1 mush.</p><p>We got Natamy to 87% when Frieda finished stabbing Ian to death. Stephen worked comms determinedly, but with just 4 of us keeping connection up was more than hard; we got the signal strength drop disconnect very early, then the second disconnect shortly after, then it took most of the Xyloph before our skills were revealed to us: Radio expert and Medic. And ghost chun and the disk were still buried in the last few Xylophs...</p><p>However the RNG showed its true colors again - we got blueprints, and among them, another grenade blueprint. Just in case we still had a mush that needed a third grenade, surely. Also the O2 ducts cut in about 10% of the time... less than once a day. Some 20% chance, Mr. Neron, thank you.</p><p>Hunters came. They were our final death.</p><p>We had a very hard trip. Kudos to Jin-Eleesha; I don't believe your strategy would have done so much damage on every ship, but on -this- ship you nearly killed us all at D2 cycle change. If you could have ensured Janice had died among the initial 6 deaths (including your own) you managed to create D1, I think that ship would have ended C3, with Ian being ejected by Neron. As was, we died early D4 I believe. Probably a bad idea to transfer and 'hide' at first.... unless you take the same skills as the person you transferred too immediately. We actually knew who you became - we just didn't have the AP to do anything about it with the few who were online and active.... don't count on every ship having that few online and active at ship-fill though <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Note to self; once the mush uses one grenade, if it doesn't instantly die, somehow get control of the other BP, and/or get people to block fuel or O2 somehow, or.... something. Somehow.</p><p>Chun, you are an awesome and cooperative newbie. Frieda, Stephen and Chun, thanks for making that ship as good as it could possibly be. We sure tried hard and played out the cards we had as best we could.</p>

                <p>Hi everybody! Just saw this now, Jin Su-Eleesha here. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br>Thank you Impet for a great thread!<br>Well i was pretty active before and right at the moment our ship got full. That lab was so full, it had even more then 7 when i was planning my actions. Thing is my partner was inactive, so that pushed me to do what i did. And while i waited for Finola and was thinking on should i start my plan Janice got out, and i wanted to get her the most. After i transferred saw stephen thought i transfered to Paola cause i punched her before the transfer, so i decided to wait a bit and see how things unfold. I was even online when i got killed (tried to run with 2 hp as i had mp, but my killer was faster). If only my mush partner was active...<br>Anyway glad we played together. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>
