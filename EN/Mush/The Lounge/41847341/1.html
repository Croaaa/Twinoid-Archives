                <p>Wanted to share a few thoughts about this ship, and maybe find my Alpha Mush partner whose company I very much enjoyed for that short time we were together.</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5737" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5737</a></p><p>This was a highly organized and active ship. I think just two inactives (Gio and Terry), with many silver/gold players. Several gold projects and NERON projects as well as the Lenses were done before the ship filled. I haven't had many this good. It felt like a possible Eden ship.</p><p>Roland and me, Raluca, drew alpha for the second time each. I immediately took Fertile, extracted a couple of spores, and trapped NERON. Janice and Kuan Ti had been very active, so our initial thought was that they would make good targets. Well, the ship was filled at D1C8, the Gas was done before that cycle finished, and the crew had Mycoalarms, Constipaspore, and the Mycoscanner by D2C7.</p><p>Stephen got that first spore instead of our intended targets, and with research being done we didn't think the slow game of converting people with traps was going to work if the crew was diligent in checking spores. Our new plan was to rush Andie, the most active player and the leader of the research team, on D2C8/D3C1 in the Medlab and convert him/her right there. In retrospect this was the right move. No one else ever seemed to go into Medlab. If we'd gotten away with that, we might have had a Sol infection.</p><p>Instead, I panicked and convinced Roland that we should convert Stephen immediately, before he checked his spores. So I took Defacer, hit him with his second spore in Alpha Dorm, wiped the logs, and Roland came over to finish him. Unfortunately I think Roland miscounted APs so no new mush there.</p><p>So that's the mush side of the story. The rest of it the crew knows: Frieda reported the wiped logs, Andie came down to investigate, Roland did a mini-rampage that didn't kill anybody but did a fantastic job of creating chaos among the crew for a couple of cycles, I converted Stephen on D3C1, wiped the logs again and was somehow able to pin it on Frieda, Derek killed Hua because she was dirty, Andie and Frieda killed each other, and then Derek and Eleesha finally figured it out and killed me around D3C6. I literally was just waiting for Stephen to get back online to try a rampage at that point, thinking we'd be figured out at any time and that with the crew already weakened we just needed to get Jin Su (last pilot) and/or Kuan Ti (last tech) to seal everyone's fate.</p><p>Anyway, notable ship for me because of how strong the start was and how fast it unraveled. I'm still learning how to play as mush, and we didn't really do much right other than get a bit lucky. Very interested to hear any other viewpoints about the ship, especially what happened after your dirty, lying engine repair tech was shot to death.</p>

                <p>Hi Raluca, Roland here. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This ship was so damn promissing at the beginning... It was the best beginning i have ever seen and i thought, we will reach Eden. Unfortunately we were chosen as mush.</p><p>Our ideas of converting the crew were really good at first, Janice and Kuan Ti on our side, two very experienced players were great and the Nexus was uncovered, so it was possible, that we got Janice or Kuan Ti on our side. But unfortunately Stephen got our spore and Myco Alarm was done fast. After Andie rushed through the Anti Mush Researches very fast, we switched our prioritys and wanted to convert Andie at the end of Day 2 and the beginning of Day 3.</p><p>We thought, Stephen had the spore and if he checked himself in the MycoScan, they will know very fast, who can be the mush. But even if he checked himself in the MycoScan, there were more than enough suspicious people, who could be the mush. We should have converted Andie, instead of trying to convert Stephen. This was our mistake.</p><p>I miscalculated the MP. When i entered A-Dorm, my last AP was converted into 4 MP and i didn´t have AP left, to convert him.</p><p>After they found out, that the logs in A-Dorm were scrambled, i knew, this was our end. Only 4 possible persons, who could it be: Andie, Frieda, Raluca and Roland (me), so i decided to sacrifice myself, because my skills were worse than yours and you can do much more damage to the crew. Andie accused Frieda (i didn´t understand this after all), because she was dirty and he knew, the he was not mush, so only you and me were left and i guess, that he will think you or me are Frieda´s partner, so i searched the grenade, which was still in Front Storage. I took Hard Boiled, a moment befor i threw the grenade, threw the grenade and hit Janice, so that they will have a hard time with moral, if she is dead, but unfortunately she got not enough damage and i didn´t have any free shots left.</p><p>Andie attacked me and got me down to 1 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">, but i was sure, that the crew can´t kill me that cycle, so i decided to play with them a bit. Andie asked me, who my partner is and i said, that Frieda is my partner and Andie my second partner. I said, that i´m disappointed, that he attacked me. It´s nice to see, that both of them killed each other in the end. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
