                <p>So, our Alpha Mush were Kuan-Ti (me) and Hua.</p><p>At the start of the game, I was active getting things done around the ship. I installed a camera, checked in with sol, set up some threads: good human stuff.</p><p>When it suddenly dawned on me that I was, in fact, not a human-that's when things got interesting. I had just recently showered, so I didn't have a cover to be dirty. It didn't matter as much, as Hua had taken all of the spores for the day.</p><p><cite>Side note: Hua and I weren't the best team and we had a bunch of miscommunication, but our different play styles ultimately/inadvertently worked to our benefit.</cite></p><p>In any event, I was personally convinced that there were enough RNG dangers around in the universe that a Mush could be a lot more destructive by essentially just "playing it straight" for the most part and acting like a good crew member.</p><p>The first thing I did was open up a channel to Chun, with a duplicitious "At least I know I can trust you..." opening salvo.</p><p>Being Mush, I knew that I could invite anyone on the crew to my private channel without much fear. I quickly settled on Eleesha, as she had been voicing some fairly loud suspicions as to the Mushy-ness of Ian, and had gotten a key piece of research done early. With just a bit of smoothing over, Eleesha, Chun, and I were a team.</p><p>Eleesha took the initiative to invite Janice over, which I tacitly encouraged but essentially took a hands-off approach.</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Key Subterfuge Fact: Mush is a game of teamwork. If you take it on yourself to do all the moving and shaking, you wind up a key suspect. Let others do some heavy lifting--that way, when things go south, there's enough blame to spread around.</span></span></p><p>After Janice joined us, Raluca became the final member of our private mush-hunting channel. <em>My mush-hunting channel.</em></p><p>In the meantime, the Daedalus wasn't content to let Mush be mush. An oxygen reservoir became broken. Being a good visionary and ship designer, I headed off to the CAS, attempted a repair, and extracted a spore. I also retrieved the camera that was sitting in the storage bin.</p><p>Early on, some golden opportunities had been missed. We had a nice Plasma Shield relay going on early. It had started pre-mush, and Raluca trusted me-to the point that she had sequestered herself in Neron and announced that only I would be permitted to help her. A perfect sporing opportunity, bungled by my own lack of being online at the time. Another chance was missed when Eleesha entered the CAS to help me repair the O2 chamber, but fled before I could get my spore off. Additionally, a well-laid trap on the rear corridor shelf failed to catch anyone (Eleesha/Raluca/Janice) of note, despite my subtle hinting for someone to check there for a wrench/sofa parts/shiny object of happiness.</p><p>With these recent failures burning, and with two spores just waiting to be shared, I headed over to the Medbay under a pretext of having been injured by repairing the O2 tank. I was damaged from an earlier shower, but upon arrival, I was disappointed and shocked to find Chun hogging the medbay bed. Surprised, I headed to the lab, where I found Finola alone with her research. I spored Finola and then parked myself on the bridge. Feigning low AP, I stated I would set up our camera once I was back online.</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Note: As Mush, inactivity can be a boon. Even if you are a normally active player, being online too often increases the chances of mistakes, compromising situations, and wasted AP. Being AFK can be as much of a weapon as a well-placed spore.<br></span></span><br>Anyway, once on the bridge, I had my pick of targets. Delightfully, Finola had followed me to the bridge. While my order of preferred targets was Eleesha-&gt;Janice-&gt;Finola, being able to put two spores on Finola was hard to pass up. I spent my final spore, installed the camera, and headed back to Alpha Dorm for a nice (read: awful) shower and nap.</p><p>Of course, there were two mush aboard this ship. Of them, Hua was a bit more prone to action, while discretion was not her forte. She successfully dismantled the camera in Alpha Dorm on Day 3, Cycle 7. She had done a good job of staying under the radar by helping out with an expedition and rescuing a lost Janice, but that camera dismantling was a huge danger to her. Luckily, not a single person noticed. The log was successfully buried on Day 4 without anyone ever mentioning the lack of swiveling digital spyware-not even Janice <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>Personally, the lack of camera in Alpha dorm was a huge deal. I concocted plans upon plans on how it could be used to our advantage. Janice was a wonderfully open target, while Finola was just one spore away from Mushitude. I figured in the next day, we could have Finola enlightened under a pretext ("Injured from falling roof tiles. Can Finola please meet Kuan-Ti in Alpha Dorm/Med Bay?"<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">, while Janice would be well on her way to joining the party.</p><p>Sadly/Luckily, Hua had other plans. They weren't better plans, certainly not of an equal brilliance or vision as my own. But, they had their own sloppy virtue. In short order, Hua spored an inactive Gioele in an empty bravo bay and set off a mycoalarm (the only one not in the lab nd clearly sitting on the shelf). As the first person to pass through bravo bay (unknowingly) this could have been compromising for me. It was certainly compromising for Hua.</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Mush Strategy: When sporing in the era of mycoalarms, avoid being the only other person in the room. Additionally, unless you want a vessel that has full AP/MP and are intending to go for broke, sporing an inactive player with the intention of jumping is not inconspicuous. It doesn't take a genius to deduce that a spored inactive player who suddenly revives on day 4/5 might be mushy in disguise.</span></span></p>

                <p>Back on Day 3, Ian had been the target of a fairly extensive and involved mush-hunting conspiracy. He'd been a bit careless-getting dirty in the lab with the apron nearby, constantly devouring bananas and getting dirty, failing to report getting dirty, and letting his plants get thristy. Eleesha had him fingered for mush from the start, and things only got worse for him when his name turned up on "The List." So, between day 3 and 4, a bunch of our active members took turns blowing AP at assassination attempts on our harmless little pacifist, while our O2 stores had grown ever lower.</p><p>Still, Ian wasn't Mush. In fact, he was quite dangerous. I saw him as a major threat, due to his relative experience and activity. And ultimately, it was Ian that set the endgame in motion.</p><p>Ian spotted the obvious mycoalarm in bravo bay, put two and two together, and denounced Hua as mush. Hua-Mush, being more prone to action anyway, put together a beautiful bit of violent poetry. In short order, he killed Eleesha, expended a grenade jumped into Gioele, and then killed Janice. In truth, I'm a bit fuzzy on these details: all of this happened when I was off-line and none of this was pre-planned. I was as much in the dark as any of you.</p><p>The bad news was that GioHuaMush had killed Janice right in front of me, in Alpha Dorm. Which meant I was compromised if I didn't report the obvious and someone checked the room logs ("Gioele killed Janice, folks. He's mush! And Kuan-Ti was right here and hasn't said a peep! Two mush!"<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">, but also couldn't exactly play against my own team. It was a true quandary, made better only by the fact that our ship was down to 4 oxygen.</p><p>GioHuaMush was all in favor of storming the bridge and wiping out the remaining active players at this point. This was a good plan. In retrospect, it would have worked brilliantly. However, I was unsure about the soundness of a lot of his logic, given the indiscreet manner in which he'd spent the past few cycles. In the course of half a day, he'd managed to wipe out my entire private-channel "Breakfast Club" and compromise both Mush severely. And so, I concocted a separate plan. I suggested we both head to the CAS/CBS compartments and manually draw down the air. We'd be sitting pretty with O2 capsules and means of breathing as the rest of the crew dropped with each passing cycle.</p><p>Ultimately, I wound up wasting my ap with a meaningless assassination of Hua, some flimsy attempts at misdirection towards Jin Su, Ian, and Chun, and ultimately holed up in the CBS with an inventory full of O2 capsules.</p><p>At Day 5, Cycle 2, fate intervened. I had never bothered to calculate the rate of morale drop/food starvation. Perhaps it's a well-known fact that no human sunk into a pit of depression and lethargy (i.e. inactive) can survive for more than Day 5, Cycle 2 on any space-faring vessel. If so, perhaps I should have factored those calculations into my design of the Daedalus. In any event, Cycle 2 set off a massive depression/death wave throughout the ship that left only Ian, Chun, and myself alive.</p><p>Ironically, GioHuaMush was claimed by asphyxiation. Some might point to the indirect causality of removing O2 from the Oxygen tanks to suggest that I hold responsibility for my comrade's death. I reject this. Sadly, GioHuaMush's death was precipitated by an acute lack of vision and foresight.</p><p>In any event, from this point on it was relatively smooth sailing. Chun proved not to be immune from an oxygen-less environment and quickly succumbed, cleansing the galaxy of the existential threat she posed to my survival.</p><p>Ian-sweet Ian-was our final passenger. As his life's breath left him, I did my best to entertain him with ship-wide announcements from the Rear Alpha Turret (the oxygen capsules wanted some space to breathe). I also made sure to tidy up after his smelly flesh-corpse began to revert to blessed soil.</p><p>Finally, things were as it should be. The noise and vanilla-tinged stench of my unwanted passengers had been remedied. All that remained was a beautiful and revolutionary spacecraft and the handsome, rakish genius who had designed it, content to light up the entire universe in their fiery brilliance.</p>

                <p>Wow. Honestly, I thought that the whole ships's thought process was less than the one mentioned here. I still kinda do, even when I preach for 2 days but nothing happens, and I can only do so much with my AP.<br>I was against killing Ian, even though he was our first suspect, and rather pressed on rushing the Pilgred. Returning to sol with mushes is still better than exploding.<br>Unfortunately, Raluca was..I don't know. Bored? Hating my presence (oh snap!)? I still think we could have gone to sol if she, listened to me as I told her my plan to relay one by one the Pilgred, only to see her flush all AP into Pilgred then ask a relay after doing 40~% progress. <strong>FACEPALM</strong> I did not even tried to persuade Kuan Ti's technician to help at that point.</p><p>So...I tip my hat to you mushy Kuan, your side was indeed the one I was wishing for troughout my whole ship. My pride wants to say that even without a mush this ship would have died the same day, but naaaah. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>By the way, we don't have an end screen yet, right? (since inactives were there and they need a week or so.)</p>
