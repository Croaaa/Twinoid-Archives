                <p>Kuan Ti here, and I'm glad you enjoyed the mood music. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I wasn't nearly as active as I would have liked to be - the last week and a half has been chaotic with hunting for a job, then finding one but having to clear all sorts of unexpected hurdles. But I'd like to think I made a difference, if only in helping the non-native english speakers with their grammar.</p><p>The ship started slow, but chatty - a good sign, since I've had a run of ships that were crippled by inactive people. Right away, Derek went inactive, and was shoved into a storage with a minimum of fuss, becoming the first successful crewmember trade I can remember. Terrence also appeared to have gone braindead in the refectory, Chun was awake at the ship start, but went idle in the lab, and Hua had a few spurts of activity before finally going silent for good.</p><p>Jin Su was the first to come under suspicion. We were short on active pilots- Andie had to switch priority to keeping the skies clear as soon as the first essential anti-mush researches were finished. Nobody was overtly suspicious, but Jin Su seemed to always be making excuses. He was out of AP, so he couldn't move the ship to the planet until next cycle. He already gave out the mission for today, but he couldn't remember who got it. He was asleep when we wanted to launch the expo. Eventually he just went silent, letting the swarms of hunters pound our hull thinner and thinner.</p><p>It got desperate pretty quickly. Raluca and I were pushing Plasma Shields through, but without a good fast relay session, it was difficult. It got to the point where hunters would kill us at cycle change, despite the valiant efforts of Roland to thin their numbers. There were only a handful of us online (most of whom had just been on an expedition), but we were coordinating everything we could give, to at least do our best before we exploded. Andie saved enough AP to relay me a couple times, and we finished with only five minutes to spare- except that plasma shield is off by default.</p><p>And then Janice moved. With no prompting at all, she swooped into the Nexus as soon as the notification went up, and turned on the shield. We were saved.</p><p>I didn't know who to trust, but something was clear. Jin Su had to die. Even if he was a human, he had nearly killed us once and showed no signs that anything would change. Stephen had been active and eager to help out, in his gruff sort of way- and very quickly was confirmed human when he was cured of a disease caught on the expedition. The bad news was that he had Apprenticed Pilot and read the shooter book to help defend the ship, so his AP was spoken for- or so I thought.</p><p>I was offline for a while, and when I came back, the crew manifest was notably smaller. Somebody online at the time would need to give the specific details, but there were two mush dead- and a third, previously unknown, still alive. Jin Su had been killed by Stephen, and revealed as Anonymush. Terrence was also dead, severely damaged by Frieda, though NERON stole the kill with a room shake. The question was, was the third mush an inactive (either Alpha or Beta), or lurking among the active crew? I suspected Terrence was a beta, turned so the lack of mushy activity would be attributed to idlers.</p><p>I'll let somebody else finish the tale from here, because after this point my focus was mostly on repairing the hull with any scrap we could get our hands on. The hunters kept coming in massive waves, and we were barely enough ahead of them to stay alive.</p><p>Special thanks to:<br><strong>Andie</strong> - Without you, I'm sure we never would have come close to Eden. You were a pilot when it was needed, pushed research when you could, and went on every expedition to keep us safe from fights. Your chat threads also kept us super organized, and your english was excellent- I never would have guessed you weren't a native speaker.</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> - First time Eleesha, but your experience with Mush in general showed. You were actively looking for signs, and it's not your fault there weren't many to find. You were definitely the right one to take the Biologist book, and your decision to hide your silver status until after the mush were dead was crafty. I enjoyed chatting with you, and salute you for your hard work!</p><p><strong>Frieda</strong> - Your english may have been a little rough, but I enjoyed our Grandma Frieda regardless. You knew your stuff, did your job, and were willing to help out with any situation that came up. Congrats on your first English server game, and I'm glad it was such a success!</p><p><strong>Paola</strong> - I'm not going to lie, I was rather annoyed by the "I'm useless, just let me die" attitude you took for a while there. But I still have to give you props for playing on a server in another language. I don't know that I'll ever be that brave. And you did good work on the Comms.</p><p>Last but not least, <strong>Stephen</strong> - You were not afraid to take charge of the situation, and there are several places where that decisiveness saved our butts. We were a little worried at the end, but you got online when it mattered, and were there to take us safely to Eden in the end.</p>

                <p>Oh oh! I hadn't even realised there was the Plasma Shield rush (or I didn't realise it was that serious and didn't attribute importance to the memory that I forgot about it ._.) Wow, apparently Janice saved the day more than once! It's thanks to her changing the priority back to Research quietly that we could get the RFS done in time too.</p><p>Thanks for the kind words, Isidarth, but I now realise how foolish I was. I've learned the lesson now, that it's equally (or even more) important to look for "I hide in plain sight" sort of activity, as it is to look for hidden information (tracking APs, morale, HP...).</p><p>Looking back at the logs, it all seems <em>so</em> clear. All Jin Su did was go back and forth between the Refectory and Bravo Dorm, showering in plain sight, without ever reporting why and when he got dirty. It's silly, and I guess there's a psychological term for this, but I payed more attention to those who were entering BD and apparently not showering (I spent days trying to keep up with Janice's APs), than to those who did do so publicly but without reporting it.</p><p>Another thing I hadn't expected was Terrence to be converted. I still don't get why they did it, but it threw me off completely so maybe it was a good idea? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And what a recap (I hadn't even realised you were paying that much attention to the game!) <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I feel intimidated to continue now, but I guess I actually know this part of the story better. I have to go off to bed now though, if no one has continued the story I'll try to finish it off tomorrow before I go off for the weekend.</p><p>Another thing, I was really surprised at the reaction we got in the Last Words, seems even the quiet people enjoyed the ship very much! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hi mates! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I lost the track of this topic after I confirmed my death. Too bad, uh? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And I guess, in France, we're just not used to have this kind of post-game discussions although I've been craving for it for ages now!!</p><p>So, here it is. I was Andie! (and yes although Andie was a 'she', the puppet-man is a 'he'. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">). Huge thanks for your kind words, I'm warmly touched, and I can't say how much I really enjoyed this flight. Easy to carry on (with an active and efficient crew), this game was on the other hand filled with an immersive hunt against the mush and even more stressfull fight for survival! (I keep thinking about the Mankarog at the end of course, but mostly to Janice with her magic poping Plasma shield a few minutes before the end! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>Anyway, after one week... To be fair, I kinda forgot everything. ahah. So let's just say that I enjoyed the crew, I liked the music, and I loved how we managed to get through all these challenges! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><strong>A few special thanks I remember :</strong><br><cite><strong> <em> Eleesha </em> </strong> for her investigation, time investment*, private talks about Mush and everything else ahah.<br><strong><em>Frieda</em></strong> for her suspicious luck about her planets (!!), and time investment*.<br><strong><em>KT</em></strong> for his moral boost through music, time investment*, and if my memory is correct RP.<br><strong><em>Stephen</em></strong> for have led us to Epic Victory. Thank you Winston C.! <br><strong><em>Raluca</em></strong>, and here my memory is really in trouble, but I'd say RP and efficiency. </cite></p><br><p><strong>A few bottom lines now :</strong><br><cite>* No idea if "time investment" means anything in English. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> But I'm sure you get my point. Cause we all know how time-consuming is this bloody game! eheh<br><br>On the time-consuming problem, I especially loved this flight for one main reason... With people coming from the US, the UK, France, Romania, and even Malaysia... Damn, in these conditions, that's damn easy to always have someone on watch. And that's bloody great! On FR servers... well, you're already lucky if you get a few canadians among the crew! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br><br>KT, yes, among lots of other thing, you did help the non-native english speakers with their grammar... And that's probably one of the many reasons I'll go on the adventure on this server. <br><br>One question though : what is "AP" standing for? After I read the topic, I would thing something like : After-ship Talk ? But in this case, it would have been "A(s)T" soooo... After-ship Peptalk ? ahah</cite></p><br><p>Soooo, thanks again, and good luck to all of you guys! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>
