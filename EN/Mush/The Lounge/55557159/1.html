Long story short, Raluca came out of nowhere and used all the hidden alcohol onboard to set everything on fire while also disassembling our fire extinguishers.</p><p>We basically ended up having to fix the PILGRED while the Engine Room was on fire, I was the only tech onboard since I had read a mage book earlier, and then Eleesha did the impossible by fixing the command terminal while it was still on fire and we all went back to Sol ! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It was a pretty great ship with lot of people doing rp, I really enjoyed it, it's a shame we had to end it so soon :/</p>

And yes, when I was jumping as Finola (my favourite character in mush) I really hoped for longer, mush free ship. But insted we had intensive ship with everything being on fire. In the end we actually had 22 fires <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> It was first time I saw ship to have so many of them and still make it.</p><p>Anyway, glad that You decided to hide that TECH book.

Unfortunately, my partner was Terrence, who was low level mush and wasn't as active I would wish. I hoped to convert someone in RC but alas, no one was possible to catch and Nexus was protected by camera and Gioele himself.</p><p>When I started to act human, I had "morale" loss due to Gioele idling in nexus. Janice never came to hug me (nor did I ask) so I was started to think, I might be suspected. Meanwhile, contact with my partner still was hard to achieve. To be honest, best contact we had, was before my firecracker show, but it was too late and my partner killed Hua. (No action from Janice was one of factors that pushed me towards desperation).</p><p>Was my rampage planned? No. I did pick up Phagocyte and pyromush 3 minutes before day change and did my performance. Because I had not so good communication with my partner and I couldn't convert anyone (I even aimed for Finola, but it was countered with myco before I could act and I couldn't act with my partner, because He was simply inactive.) Lack of conversion was second factor to push me into acting.</p><p>Third factor was Stephen calling out Terrence about his actions and me, myself, seeing him waisting 4PA on turret and someone randomly saw him in storage.</p><p>Knowing that Terrence death might be a matter of 2 days in most positive way of thinking, I know RFS might be smelt in the air and I'm not the one, who easly gets cured. Not when I watch.</p><p>So, quick decision of can I utilize 4 spores in a fast enough way, that it will be efficient. So... I just unlocked pyromaniac for mush and go for it!</p><p>Hiding behind Ian was just accident.<br>Hua was target because of Technician skill.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">Pasiphae escape is for people without strategies!</span></p>

Yeah right.</p><p>We usually consider Raluca to be a cold hearted loner, but our Raluca proved us wrong, deciding to share her worm feelings not only with the crew, but with the whole ship <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico">. Terrence - her mush partner, mutated and killed, as it was seem to be, our last tech Hua. Fortunately KT was 4th level bronze, so we had a chance to save ourselves by making him gold, but it turned out that our random starting book was Tech. We quickly abandoned the idea of decoding xyloph and just pushed hard to fix pilgred and get back.</p><p>It was interesting to see how Raluca spammed 6 fires in 5 minutes, which in one day spread across the whole ship. I enjoyed seeing "suicidal Chun", drunkie Eleesha, germaphobe Finola, craving Kuan Ti and Neron hating Janice work together perfectly, to deal with crisis. Our commander was there and Stephen kept unwanted pedestrians out of the engine room <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/mastered.png" alt=":mush_mastered:" class="tid_ico">, when I was giving our technician Chun logistics, while fixing pilgred.</p><p>Everyone was great during this round, and hopefully nobody was disappointed by our relatively short journey.</p>
