                <p>Frieda here. <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4118" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4118</a></p><p>Let me start by saying that I hope both Stephen and Jin Su have been banned. It wasn't hard to figure out Stephen was Mush after he immediately apprenticed pilot and took off in the Pasiphae. We thought at first he'd taken the mush sample but no it was just a weak suicide attempt. As evidenced by Jin Su almost immediately opening private channels with folks and saying "Stephen said he was going to suicide and now I'm on my own. What do I do?"</p><p>Unfortunately for Jin Su what I did was pick up a blaster and murder him on the bridge. This was in the middle of rushing Neron projects to get magnetic net and capture Stephen. It took many rounds of projects but ultimately we did and beat him to death in AB2. Stephen had plausible deniability in regards to suiciding until Jin Su made it clear that he openly claimed that was his goal.</p><p>Why someone wouldn't want to be mush is beyond me.</p><p>Anyway, the actives worked together quite well until Gioele was commander and never spoke to anyone, moved when the rebel base appeared and generally seemed like a griefer. With him out of the way thanks to the rest of the crew, Commander Bergmann took control and was eager to get us all to Eden. After all, immediate knowledge of the mush should have resulted in a stressfree trip to Eden.</p><p>Sadly we had an expo with 3 potential starmap pieces that only killed Kuan Ti and then Janice through a MIA event. Those deaths weigh heavily on my head.</p><p>Raluca like a rockstar completed the serum, then the ship was silent except for Paola and myself. We asked 7 hours ago who wanted to return to Sol and ultimately decided that the risk we went to bed and came back to an exploded ship wasn't worth it. So we hit the button and returned.</p><p>I also kept a journal at: <a href="http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/journal/v/276" target="_blank">http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/journal/v/276</a></p>

                <p>Paola here. That ship was wild those first couple days, while we built the magnetic net and awaited Stephen not with open arms, but small arms. After both of the mush outed themselves and it was all over, the 10 of us that were active began a brave journey to Eden. I tried to mostly keep my head down and do my job, but from time to time I got involved in some of the craziness too.</p><p>Frieda: I have never had a finer commander, after I knifed griefer Gioele to death for trying to murder that expedition and everything else he did to us, you were there to lead the ship and her crew onward. Having a planet-scanning commander was fantastic and we wouldn't have mobilized any expos as quick as they did without you.You were the best bridge buddy I could ask for and you helped me out multiple times.</p><p>Raluca: Oh my gosh, poor raluca had so much to do, but made out like a superhero. From rushing PILGRED to fixing comms to using Genius to get the serum, I dare say you were the biggest hero of us all. Best wishes to you wherever you go.</p><p>Janice: I am so sorry we lost you. I jumped straight down to IB as soon as the team came back to go looking for you but we were sadly too late.you did a great job keeping morale up and easing the tensions that arose here and there.</p><p>Chun: I am so sorry you never got the million and one relays you needed. You had a brutal, if not impossible job as the sole researcher. I hope that medic book I found helped a little at least.</p>

                <p>Kuan Ti here, first of all I apologize for my foul language (I'm fairly certain it was the excessive use of homofobe sentences targeted at Gioele, it was a lapse of judgement I will hope and try to never repeat that.). It was a fine ship untill everyone seemed to stop playing, as usual Roland took first place (I shall find a way to kill the next one if I'm not him.), loved or comms officer fast work in getting those bases, Gioele was a terrible commander and that's all. I loved to pretend that when the RNG targeted Frieda it was all part of my plan to take over the ship.<br>It was a shame that Stephen forced Jin Su to give up and surrender themselves they could probably do a good job at taking over the ship with the commander title, but instead they decided not to play.<br><em>I'm probably forgetting stuff but someone will jog my memory.</em></p>
