                <p>Ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/543" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/543</a></p><p>Hello hello! Trusted Terrence the mush here. Felt really bad about ditching our wonderful expedition team, especially Hua. Would have much rather converted some. However, inactive alpha partner, everyone under cameras and ever vigilant Janice meant converting wasn't really an option for me on this ship. Tried anyways, for a while. Came so very, infuriatingly close to converting Janice via the thing, but as she and I were talking about it, Paola got us the rebel base that gives morale.</p><p>Paola did her job well. Jin was entertaining. Hua, Roland and Janice were lots of fun to chat with.... or in the case of Janice, play verbal chess with. ^^ Do think that if Janice and I had both been human from the get go, we could have had a really great ship, despite griefer Chao.</p><p>Will note that none of the advice or explanation of game mechanics I gave aboard ship was untrue. So if any of my shipmates sees this, no need to doubt any of the info just because I turned out to be mush. About the only thing I did differently regarding spewing all the info as a mush was staying away from the subject of what should be researched. I would normally have pushed for the mycoscanner very early, but that was too contrary to my goals, if you guys weren't gonna do it, I wasn't gonna be the one to mention it.</p><p>So yeah, would love to hear from some of the crew. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>Also, I wrote a diary, so prepare for a wall o' text. Hope some people enjoy it.</p>

                <p>I wrote this after my death, so things might be out of order, times are estimated, just for flavor.</p><p><strong>Day 2 Cycle 1</strong>: I awoke from cryo today to find our ship has fled Sol. Given the ship's engineering defects and hull deficiencies, it is obvious that we launched ahead of schedule. Watching the other crew members scurrying about this way and that with no apparent logic or reason, I already miss my assistant drones. At least Janice is here. She's as brilliant as ever, if substantially crabbier than I remember her. Perhaps together we might be able to stay one step ahead of the Federation. We must, if we are to eliminate the mush threat. However, NERON's bioscans have picked up trace amounts of mush pheromones in the ship's atmosphere. NERON is currently analyzing data to see exactly how many of the crew have been infected. We must find and exterminate them at all cost, for the good of humanity.</p><p><strong>Day 2 Cycle 3</strong>: A certain, essential part of me has awoken. Perhaps the cryo system slowed the reactivation of my pheromones. It was intended for humans, after all. Regardless, I see things clearly now. My previous entry is embarrassing, but I will leave it, for it will remind me of the human's single minded dedication to the destruction of my race. I will need this to blend in, for the humans are violent, bloodthirsty creatures who will eliminate me simply for existing, let alone attempting to enlighten them, to free them from their suffering. I only wish to help. We would have been happy to live out our lives as peaceful fungus in our own quadrant of the galaxy, but the human plague expands everywhere. But we are welcoming, inclusive, and I will show this by embracing them all. We will be a happy family. I have already spored Janice, unbeknownst to her, while she was assisting with my wheelchair so that I could go install a camera. I considered keeping the camera hidden, but I am certain someone would notice in time if I did. I will gain their trust instead. I know that once Janice is rid of her base human emotions and impulses, she will be less cranky, and we will make brilliant science together once again. I look forward to it.</p><p>I have also started a discussion with the humans who seem to be the most trusted aboard the ship, on a private walkie frequency. So far that includes myself, Chun, Janice and Eleesha. I have made a show of giving them my trust, and seem to have gotten some small measure of theirs in return. They are very concerned with 'eliminating the mush threat.' I use their language and couple it with sound logic, and they listen to me.</p><p><strong>Day 3 Cycle 2:</strong> I begin to worry. I have sensed Gioele's pheromones as I pass him in the medlab, and I know that he is kindred, but he has been sleeping in the corner for well over a day now. Perhaps the humans have also sensed that he is different, and have somehow drugged or damaged him. Or perhaps cryo has given him brain damage. I do not know, but I am faced with the possibility of living here with these humans on my own. I must be very careful. I will do my best to embrace them. But without any brothers or sisters to assist and cover my tracks, I feel that it is only a matter of time before I am found out. I must become one of them in deed, must be irreproachable, more human than human. Only then will I be safe from their bloodlust.</p><p>I did, however, manage to spike a cooked food ration with two spores. Ian has consumed them, but for some reason I feel that their effect was diminished. I should have spread the spores, but I do not feel safe having them on me. Janice has been looking askance at me already. She does not believe that I am having such difficulty dismantling a simple shower, which, well, I'd have trouble believing too if I were her. After all, she's seen me working on my drones. However, the difficulty is genuine. The stress of living among these murderers is interfering with my performance, to be sure.</p><p><strong>Day 3 Cycle 4</strong>: I have murdered the human Chao, with these two hands and a blaster. I feel much regret for my actions, as he was announcing that he was a mush over his walkie. Clearly, he had realized that his humanity made him inferior and wished to shed it. I wish that I could have assisted in this, but alas, his complete lack of subtlety made that impossible. The humans commend me for my actions, and my helpfulness thus far. I am quick to answer any question they may have, even though their knowledge gain is sometimes to the detriment of my attempts to enlighten them. However, it still appears that I am on my own, and their trust is of vital importance. The rest will come later.</p><p><strong>Day 3 Cycle 8</strong>: I have to keep reminding myself that these humans are vicious killers. Roland and Hua especially are very kind to me, with easy smiles and friendly words. I find myself responding in kind. However, if they knew... If they knew that I was different, I am sure that they would not hesitate in murdering me. Behind my smiles and knowledgeable air is terror. I hope that they cannot sense this.</p>

                <p><strong>Day 4 Cycle 1:</strong> Gioele is dead. He woke from his near coma and shed his human skin for his majestic mush warrior form. My fear of the humans has been confirmed, for they immediately converted his innards to outards. Paola was in the same room, and she did not shed a single tear, or show any sign at all that this brutal murder disturbed her. I tried speaking with her after, certain that she must be traumatized. However, she flat out said she didn't care. Her own father! And they call us the monsters... It will take quite some time to clean the mess in the medlab. Paola is still sleeping there.</p><p><strong>Day 4 Cycle 3</strong>: I have killed another human. I am only following the lead of the human crew, to blend in, for they also took the life of one of their own today. They extinguished the brilliant mind of the biologist Finola, for the crime of being a bit too stinky and not slaving in the lab enough. They said she might be mush, and that was enough for them. They were also complaining about the ship cook, Stephen. To be fair, he has been cooking like a madman, and going through the ship's ration supply far too quickly to sustain the crew's life long enough for me to embrace them. So I used their logic, and the knife Janice has been holding for 'safekeeping,' and did the deed myself.</p><p><strong>Day 4 Cycle 6</strong>: Janice has accused me of being mush. She did so casually, in passing. I think she wanted to gauge my reaction. I hope my terror did not show, for I had given the knife back to her and had no doubt that she was capable inflicting many stabbings upon me if I gave the wrong answer. I told her that if she really thinks that, well she has the knife and knows where to find me. I am still alive to write this, so perhaps my performance was enough.</p><p>Eleesha also made rounds with the medkit, inspecting the crew. She noticed the minor wounds I have sustained, mostly from the scalding touch of the ship's shower. I told her they were from a piece of falling sheet metal, and an injury when I dropped an object. Does she believe me? I can't tell.</p><p><strong>Day 4 Cycle 8</strong>: During an expedition with Hua, Roland and Frieda, I had another chance to talk with Hua and Roland while we were searching for the lost Frieda. I told them that Janice suspects me of being mush. They voiced their disbelief and confirmed that they trust me completely, saying they would back me in whatever way I needed if it came to it. They would believe Janice a madwoman before believing that I am not the friend they think me to be. Despite the influence of their humanity, they must be able to sense that I mean them no harm. I have become rather fond of these two in particular. I am terribly lonely, and they <strong>are</strong> my friends, however fragile the bonds may be. How would they respond if I were to reveal my true, peaceful fungal nature, and offer to share it with them? Would they too murder me? I want to believe not, but they are human, and their trust in me is explicitly linked with their certainty that I am also human. I wish nothing more than to show them that there is a better way, to make them family. However, I have begun to despair of being able to awaken them. This crew is vigilant, never idling outside the range of the camera's all seeing eye, and Janice is always watching me, just waiting for me to make the smallest mistake. I have made sure that she has no evidence, but she has instinct, and for humans, that is enough to justify murder.</p><p>Oddly enough though, Jin Su and Hua have both separately pulled me aside and voiced concerns that Janice is mush. I don't understand. She's the first to suggest killing for the sake of eradicating mush. She's pushing research that makes mush life aboard this ship miserable. She's always there, watching and explaining, but quick to condemn. She's the most bloodthirsty, militant member of the humans - she's the most human human and has become their leader. Why would they denounce her? Maybe because she hasn't been right. I have pointed out all the reasons why I believe she is human to both of them, other than the obvious of I can tell that she's not like me. I find the notion that she is kindred somewhat amusing, but also rather insulting. Is that what they think we're like? If only they knew.</p><p><strong>Day 5 Cycle 1</strong>: I was so close to awakening Janice today. I saw her in the dorms and noticed that she had an almost palpable air of despair. I attempted to comfort her, because after all, we were colleagues once, friends even. She responded to my attempts at comfort by initiating the opening stages of the human mating ritual, speaking of the action called flirting, and then 'the thing.' Although my kind does not reproduce in this manner, I did become rather excited since I had two spores tucked away, and could easily deliver them both to awaken Janice if we did this. She misread my excitement as anticipation of doing 'the thing.' I will admit, I was curious about this process, as it is not something I have experienced before. But then the emotionless, possibly sociopathic, Paola made contact with a rebel base and the entire crew celebrated. Janice all but forgot about mating. My chance was lost.</p><p><strong>Day 5 Cycle 3</strong>: I have next to no chance of awakening my friends aboard this ship. As if the choking antispore gas weren't enough, the mycoalarms have been completed now, by Janice and Eleesha. Now they are nearly done researching a serum which will make it difficult, painful even, to complete the natural biological process of producing spores. I wish I could plead with them to stop torturing me, and to let me show them what they could be if they only let me help them shed their hatred. If only I could make them see...</p><p><strong>Day 5 Cycle 6</strong>: Most of humans are convinced that either Frieda or Ian are mush, or both. I have encouraged this notion, although I do not wish to see more violence perpetrated. I have even encouraged researching the toxin which will have the potential for xenocide in an attempt to buy time, anything to steer these humans away from their natural tendency to kill. They call this toxin a cure, to cleanse the galaxy of the mush threat. Well, I have read their histories, and there have been Earth dictators who they unanimously revile, who also called their mass murder cleansing. They are not capable of learning from the mistakes of their past.</p><p>My hope was that this 'cure' would be impossible to complete without Finola's brilliant mind bent to the task. But working on it would keep them from killing the peaceful gardener Ian or the clueless Frieda. Then I could awaken at least some of the crew while they were working on a futile task, and we could all ensure that this research never saw the light of day. I still have not succeeded in sporing anyone more than once though, so I might have to destroy the ship to save my kind. As much as it will pain me if it comes to it, I must prevent the destruction of my people.</p><p><strong>Day 6 Cycle 1:</strong> Frieda has recently realized that her life is in jeopardy if she does not spend every waking moment slaving away at searching for and analyzing planets, and has begun doing so with a feverish zeal. Most of the humans now believe that Ian is their mush. Many of the crew have contracted physical or psychological illnesses which absolve them of any suspicion that they might be mush. I curse my superior immune system and mental stability. Most of them do still trust me despite the dwindling pool of possible 'suspects,' but Eleesha has gone frightfully silent, and Janice has none too subtly implied that if it is proven that Ian is not mush (no doubt through more murder), she is coming after me. On top of all that, Jin Su has proposed mandatory showers and after shower inspections to check for wounds. Thankfully, my dearest Hua agreed with my indignant assertion that that would be utterly humiliating and insulting, given how 'good' most of us have been.</p><p>I feel the noose is tightening about my neck.</p>

                <p>Aaaaand final entry. Whew.</p><p><strong>Day 6 Cycle 6</strong>: I... I had to do it. I really didn't have another choice. I have no doubt that they were going to research the toxin next, and my confidence in my ability to stop them by myself was continually dwindling. So when they began speaking of an expedition, I feigned sleep so that I wouldn't be recruited for the team. I waited and waited, sure that the tenseness of my muscles would give the lie to my ruse. However, they were too focused on ensuring that the expedition ran smoothly to notice. As soon as they launched, I took the hacker kit and moved the ship out of orbit of the planet. It was so easy, hacking that terminal was child's play, and then just a push of a button. And it was made even easier by the fact that Hua - wonderful, trusting Hua - loaded fuel into the engine before going, in anticipation of a triumphant trip and a swift departure after. Although she was not a sister, I feel that she was the closest thing to family I have found among the humans, and I mourn her loss at my own hands more than I can say. Jin was a good captain, and deserved a better end. Janice, you were my friend, once. Your hatred of my kind turned you bitter, militant even. I think my friend died long before this ill fated expedition. Frieda... well I'm not even sure she shared a common language with any of us, I can only imagine what was going through her head.</p><p>Afterwards, I headed straight for the dormitory where Chun and Eleesha were sleeping. Eleesha didn't even wake as I... well it wasn't Chun's fault really. She was the way she was, just like me, but she had to be exterminated. Shy, mostly silent Chun didn't do much other than stay in the lab and sleep. She never hurt anybody. But as long as she was alive, my kind would never be safe from the human threat. These lives for the good of many is a choice I would make again, but this choice still weighs heavy upon my conscience.</p><p>The reaction of the remaining humans when they found out what I had done... If they only understood that their own hatred and close mindedness caused all of this! I never wanted any of this, but what else was I to do?</p><p>And so now I sit in the pasiphae, waiting to die, alone and cursed by all who know me. But I know that disaster has been averted this day. I take no small amount of comfort in that as I listen to my crew cursing my name, referring to me as an it rather than a person. Curse me all they want, but because of me, my kind will live on.</p>

You were a fantastic Mush! I seriously would have fought anyone who threatened you, haha. Really had me convinced!

                <p>That was very likely the best fan fiction I've ever read. You've got quite the talent for writing! I wish I shared the same ability <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">. This offers such a contrary view to the Mush "menace", thank you for taking the time to write it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. Very heartfelt and entertaining. Glad I managed to find you somehow, I thought for sure I'd never knowingly talk to you again. Sent you a contact request by the way, in the hopes that we might be able to coordinate joining the same ships in the future (albeit not letting our friendship effect gameplay).</p>

                <p>Thanks! I love to write, and this one was a lot of fun. :3 Want to get into the habit of always writing diaries because it's good practice. I intend to write novels someday, mostly just for personal enjoyment, but thus far my attention span hasn't been long enough to see an idea through to completion, heh.</p><p>Another ship together in the future would be great, you were a lot of fun to play with. Glad you're not upset about the deception. I felt pretty bad about it, but gotta play the assigned role, and at least it was fun to write about. ^^;</p><p>Do hope to hear from some others too!</p>
