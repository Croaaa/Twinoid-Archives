Anyway... I was alpha mush with Roland, on a semi-inactive crew with a bunch of zombies mixed in with a few good, active players. Both mush were active, as well as Chun, Hua, Janice, Derek, Raluca and a few others.</p><p>Chun had Lethargy and decided to sleep in Bravo Dorm to keep an eye on the shower, which made her dangerous, but also made the medlab bed available. Janice, who ended up sleeping there at the end of day 1 after working in the lab, was the ideal target. Unfortunately, Roland had already used his daily spore by trapping a bay, and had made an unexplained passage through Bravo Dorm, making him Chun's prime suspect. So, on cycle 8, I went through medlab to pick up a pill for CSS, spiked Janice, then went to medlab to start the research. Then, very subtly (... or not), I went from the lab to Alpha Bay 2 to "check on Roland"... via Front Corridor to extract spores and phagocyte, medlab to spike Janice again, Bravo Bay and Rear corridor. Not at all suspicious. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Around the end of day 2, Janice decided to sleep again in medlab. Roland extracted a spore, went through Bravo Dorm again to have a sneaky shower, and then finished Janice's conversion. Both Janice and I had to tell Chun about those movements (she would have noticed them anyway), and she announced that she would kill him the next cycle. Our plan was that Janice would pick Anonymush the second Roland died, so that no one realized there was a third mush. Unfortunately, one second was all it took for Chun to notice, and the list of potential alphas and betas was quite short. She decided to start with Terrence, and when he was dead and she saw that he was human, she considered going for Janice. So Janice and I rushed to the lab to get Ian's protection. She removed the camera, spiked Andie, transferred, and proceeded to kill Raluca and Kuan Ti, before running back to the lab.</p><p>Things then became very confused. Chun didn't know who to trust between Hua or me. Derek had no clue what was happening. As Chun was advising Hua to take off for protection (which she didn't do, unfortunately for us), JanAndie rushed to the engine room to load fuel, chased by Derek all over the ship. He finally caught up with her in the lab, but was out of AP. Chun then very kindly handed me a blaster to shoot Andie, and I used it to shoot Hua instead... or try to shoot her, because I missed twice. Hua fled to the bridge with Chun guarding Front Corridor, and Gioele eventually killed Andie.</p><p>At day change, I rushed to Front Corridor and killed Chun. I should have read the logs first, though, because it turned out that she wasn't guarding the corridor anymore, and I could have gone to the bridge and get Hua, who was the only pilot and technician left. Oh well...</p><p>I then played hide and seek with Gioele and Derek for a few hours, with them kicking Ian in and out of rooms while I ran after him. At some point I tried to kill Hua again, failed, and they killed me. Eventually, the few survivors were killed by hunters while trying to finish Pilgred.</p><p>It was a real mess and we all did big mistakes, but we sure had a lot of fun. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hua here!<br>What a confusing Mush showdown it was. And drawn out. I was just doing my pilot thing, mostly working on Plasma Shield when Chun killed Roland. Okay, 1 down, 1 to go! But Chun is 100% sure she saw a third one that took anonymush. Hmm... Possible suspects are Terrence, Jin Su, Janice. At that point I made my way to the lab hoping to get out pheromodem. Janice and Jin Su follow me there, I think maybe to help me with pheromodem.</p><p>Janice takes the camera down, and that's when I made a run for it. No converting me noooo! So I stand in Front corridor, but Andie that was previously a complete zombie rushes by me, killing Kuan Ti in the process! I get the knife from spent Chun, chase Andie around but doesn't get to save Raluca in time, and now Andie's back in the lab. With Ian. Inconvenient!</p><p>Jin Su claims he's out of AP to help kill Janice, which raises a red flag. Why is he in the lab, then? Still, Chun brings him a ration and a blaster since I didn't manage to kill Andie, and he shoots at me instead! I have 2mp left, and that's it, I'm now the only pilot and the only tech on board. I can't die! Chun tells me to go into hiding on the bridge, and she guards Front Corridor. I suspect Jin will try to kill her at Day change, but she's wearing the armor, right?</p><p>Nope. she traded it for the cat. There goes Chun. It takes a few more cycles of Derek, Gioele and myself taking turns at punching our fungified commander into submmission, but at last. We are mush free. Great! Now let's rush Pilgred and go home!</p><p>Except Pilgred is at 0%, and that's when 20hunters show up.</p><p>We got it to 60% before blowing up, but we never got back home.</p>

                <p>Ehm... I think I will be able to add few things into this story. Will You mind, my dear, DEAR Chunny The Chun? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> It was so stressfull ship for You, so please, please! Relax and listen! LET MEMORIES COME BACK TO YOU! Muhahahahahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> But... Let's not jump into ending. Shall we start from begining? Hmm??? Ok! Than let's start!</p><p>It all began when Janice woke up. And Janice is me! This is MY story <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I woke up as first from whole crew! All ship was mine... Exept soon other TE members came in... And not only TE members. In the end ship was mixture of active competent players, and zombies. There was more actives than inactives - but still there was a lot of inactives in general, which already made this ship weaker than it should to be.</p><p>I will not concentrate on every single event that took place, as many of them were irrelevant. Insted I will concentrate on those important ones. So firstly - I encouraged (rightfully!) Chun to go Lethargic. So far only Chun with Lethargy I saw in action was myself (and one on Casting ship for short time - I don't count that). I must say that was propably best advice I made for humman team on this ship... <span class="tid_user tid_user_7937939 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7937939">Deadmanwater</span> - You do not realize how I did felt knowing that I am facing A MONSTER WITH KNIFE AND 24 AP that want only one thing - to kill me! Trust me - You WERE TERRYFYING! But... I will come to that later. First things first. All players eventually came online. We got mixed crew with good actives, braindead zombies and few low actives. And I was humman.</p><p>First thing that catch my attention was Derek who decided to idle in Front Bravo Turret. Well... He had good reason to, but why not on Bridge under camera? Has He become dirty for some reasons? Hmm? I choose to check on Him and got immidietly contacted by Him. I explained to Him and Chun my reasons, and You can see on list why it was "ok" for me to visit Him there. I could have not done any sporing, since I didn't visited Shower Dorm at all and was not dirty yet even once.</p><p>I was spored by Jin Su twice on Day Change. Some may ask WHY ON EARTH HAVE I BEEN IN MEDLAB? I AM SUPPOSED TO STAY IN DORM WITH CREW FOR MORALE!!! Well... Bad luck - everybody in line for Comm Officer title was idle! That is right! I stayed there for that one cycle as we expected that I will get that tile on next day! So I burned IT Points on research, some extra AP and went to Medlab to wait my new assigment. Did I got it? Nope! Aparrently Stephen used up some of His AP/MP so He grabbed title before me &gt;.&lt;</p><p>OK! BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU NOTICED JIN WAS ENTERING MEDLAB?! I did noticed that! Oh! I did! I reported that to Chunny The Chun immidietly! However - Jin had legitimate reason to enter once - to get pill for CSpore research. It was second time when He entered what allarmed me... Still I was not sure! And as we see Chun was also not sure about Jin Su. Jin Su helping with research did also good to hide Him a bit from my suspicions... So He was left living <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Roland in that time gathered whole Chun's suspicions - that propably was also a reason on why Jin Su was having more freedome of movments <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I must say that I didn't knew anything about Roland at that time! Why? Because I have never visited Shower Dorm at all! So I didn't knew He was Mush.</p><p>There was nothing worthy of attention later untill one UNLUCKY event... You see... Terrence got to Lab with intention to work on research... But He forgot to use apron and ate first... What was worse, He was nearly at full AP, and eating ration was mistake - He wanted first to burn those 4 AP on research, to get them back from ration... As it went, He got dirty and wasted 3 out of 4 AP granted by ration... And He didn't had MP to reach Shower without wasting additional AP... In short - Terrence needed somebody to "push" him through one room. I choose to help, as I could use my IT Points for research! So I went there, and than I waited in FC for Terrence to come online... And waited, and waited... And know what? Cycle change was getting near. So I choose to at least grab 2 AP from bed - FC or MedLab... Equally dangerous places. So better to have those 2 AP than not to have, right? Beside... Let's be hones! Mush can not be active RIGHT in this moment when I am lying there, right? RIGHT?!</p><p>So I entered Medlab and lied down... And Terrence soon went through, so I could get back to Dorm! Yay! Emm... Not really... I was sure Terrence was NOT Mush. I had reasons for that - though I don't remember them right now, there was reason to believe Him to be humman... Or non-sporing Mush at least. Anyway - helping Terrence looked safe, so I did helped Him. But why I could not left MedLab? BECAUSE I WENT OFFLINE BEFORE TERRENCE GOT THROUGH MEDLAB!!! I marked when will be cycle change to return online and go back into Dorm with camera ASAP after cycle change.</p><p>And now funny coincidence - I just sit down in front of monitor, was going to log on to do just that... And something else did distracted me for another 30 minuts (or so). So after that I do come back and log on only to get message that I am a Mush now. Should I back than choose to firstly go online and than tend to my Real Life... But no. It went this way, and no turning back now...</p><p>This is how I became Mush. So Jin Su and Roland - say "Thank You" to Terrence for that one <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> Not that I think I did good - generally I would say that both teams did sloppy work here. Jin and His double walking through Medlab. Me and careless taking naps there... Roland and His Shower Dorm regullar visits... Haha? I think it is funny so (Kuan Ti DIES!) HAHAHAHAHA <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Ok... So I am Mush now. Converted by Roland and Jin Su. And cycle 8 was getting near... Cycle 8 was time when 24AP Chun will come online and will do some work... And will discover Roland visited me in Medlab. And Terrence... Well... That ment I need to tell about Roland anyway. So I did! And Chun made decision - at C8 She kills Roland. What could I do? I could only offer my help and hope I will manage to take Anonymush when Roland dies...</p><p>In the meantime on Mush Channel for some reason Jin Su and Roland behaved like I would be new leader of Mush team. At least that was my feeling. Why? Jin Su pressented me with full list of things that we may do - and I was to choose what we will do... Roland on other hand was from begining just doing what was told to do (more or less) and was doing it good. Why was I treaten like that? My guess is that Roland was better listening to others, while Jin Su (Peanuts) did knew that sad truth is, if we want to infiltrate Sol than both He and Roland must die. And that will leave only me as Hidden Mush (Elemele inactive so no list). So it was actually up to me whether I want to try it or not. Well - I wanted! So... That was our plan:</p><p>1. Main point is that Mush protect Janice and Her good standing with Chun at all cost - even at cost of Roland and Jin Su if needed.<br>2a. If Chun decides to kill Roland on C8 than Janice will take quickly Anonymush and will play humman till end of ship.<br>2b. If Chun will not kill Roland yet, than we all go to Raluca and make Her one of us - and Janice takes anonymush and play humman till end of ship.<br>3. If discovered than, and only THAN we make rampage.</p><p>That was good plan. But it was unfortunate that I was one second to late with Anonymush... Roland died to fast for me, and could not be quick eoungh. Chun noticed that there was another Mush on board, and soon made it obviously obvious on IRC that Janice must be another one... And that forced me and Jin Su to rampage...</p><p>Firstly I went to Lab in order to transfer into Andie (who was inactive) because with Devoted I could get 6 additional AP from Jin Su's mission... And another just after day change <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> That was good start! Of course I did had 2/3rd AP bar of Janice as well... And with 6 Gold Days from Jin I could do few nice tricks ^^ THANK YOU PEANUTS! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But before rampage I wanted to make sure that Chun will kill Terrence, so I just waited for that in Lab (with Ian). And than for fun I complained to Chun "What are You doing Chun?! I have only 4 morale left! Do You want me to die?!" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I have no idea what would have happen should I not rampage than...</p><p>Chunny The Chun?! Would You start thinkng that I am humman after that? Would You believed it? Or would You still killed me?</p><p>But... I decided to not risk it - 24AP monster was after me! Some spend on Roland... Some on Terrence... But there were surely more than needed to kill me. Or at least I believed so... I was terrified of that! I took out camera from Lab - posted some cynical answer for Hua when She pointed out that I took camera out of there and removed spore in Medlab. Than I went into Front Corridor and attacked few times TuttiKuanTi - to soften Him a bit... Than I entered Lab, infected Andie and transfered ^^ And I noticed that I have 12 AP and 6 from Mission waiting to be used ^^ Cool! Right? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>First stop - Ralulu! I was running toward Raluca, being chased by 24AP Chunny The Chun with knife! In meantime I was posting "crazy messages" that would make ship looks more like mad house, than ship full of brightest people that humman race has to offer...</p>

                <p>And so I managed to get into Turret where Ralulu was waiting... RNG loved me! I missed only 2 times! And Raluca was soon dead <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Than I moved into Front Corridor when TuttiKuanTi waited for me... We had things to finish... Too bad I TOTALLY forgot about Hua being Tech! Should I remember that Hua would be dead back than... But I didn't. Insted I killed Kuan Ti! <strong>Kuan Ti DIES! <em>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!</em></strong> I had still some AP and MP to spare. I think I could have done more damage, but I hoped to live into another cycle to get 2AP from sleeping in bed (would enter Medlab just before cycle change) and 6 AP from mission from Jin Su. THAT would put even Lethargic Chun itno shadow! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Apart from killing Tech and active members of crew I had also one more aim in head - to demoralize hummans. No! Not in game - not drive morale meter towards zero as much as possible. I wanted to make them believe that they can not win, that I can kill them all with Jin Su... Or even better - to show them that I alone can bring them nightmares greater than they can endure, while there is another one apart from me hiding somewhere... By reading IRC and what Chunny The Chun was writing on ship... I think I managed to do it to certian degree. I made Derek and Chun to waste their AP just to catch up with me... I killed two hummans... <strong>I was trying succesfully convince Chun that I WAS ALPHA MUSH!!! And was so clever that managed to convert Roland without Her ever noticing ANYTHING!!!</strong> Later She came to realisation that I was beta, but at time when people died and She was confused it worked perfectly! I brought menta chaos! I love that! Though I think that Hua was unaffected by this. But She was not my target - Chunny The Chun was <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Sweet Chunny! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> And one of my "psychological" attacks against Chun worked greatly, and proven to be deadly in it's outcome!</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Hey! Chun! Did You knew it... Propably not really but still... Did You knew it that avarange cat is so perfect and beautifull that hugging it alone may help You to feel better? It can even stop You from suciding... WOULD BE TRAGIC IF SUCH NOBLE ANIMAL WOULD DIE! Don't You agree? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></span></span></p><p>Chun's reaction on that? Armor dropped, cat taken <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Oh! And She needed to go to FC again in order to guard it... So another precious AP lost <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> What happened after that? I died! Gioele came in and killed me... Rest was up for Jin Su... And we all know that armorless Chun offered little resistance for Him <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway - I had great time seeing Deadmanwater to panick at everything I said... Oh! I also claimed that we do have 2 Betas on ship, not only one <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Wonder if that had any effect on You as well ^^</p><p>This is my part of story! Surely few things are remembered wrong. Some were misunderstooded... And some propably forgotten completly.
