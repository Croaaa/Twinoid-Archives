                <p>Roland here:</p><p>Pre-mush, the future mush looked like it would have a starting advantage because Jin Su had run out of the lab holding the cat and the apron. Raluca hadn't shifted from the lab but Derek with wrestler was able to shift her but it was looking like it would be too late. Ian was a tutorial player who didn't get round to fixing the broken door, and Paola hadn't started the tutorial.</p><p>I started the ship with a burst nose. After I took down the starting wave of hunters, I had taken the coffee and ration, fixing myself up. There were other injuries aboard. Derek had bruised shoulder.</p><p>On full ship, I discover a change in myself and that of Derek. We were alpha mushes. He managed to fix himself up. However, on the first day, we didn't take the opportunity to extract.</p><p>Comms was still down at day change so I went up to the bridge to help however, as I got there, Frieda had beaten me to it. I extracted on the way back down in Bravo Bay, stealth showered taking splashproof. Derek also extracts after fixing his shoulder and heads to BD. We don't see many people with starting spores. Jin Su had one, as did Hua.</p><p>There is a wave of hunters, Hua shoots and so do I. All down. Terrence wants to do research but as he is a pilot, I persuade him to do a scrap run. Although the mush sample is in the lab, research is slow. Projects progress nicely with Andie, a polyvalent, pushing Blaster Gun.</p><p>Jin Su was dealt with, freeing the apron and cat to return to the lab.</p><p>Janice comes to BD. Cycle 8, late in the cycle, we convert Hua, and put two spores on Terrence. Day change, I deface, Terrence is converted and Janice has now one spore on her. I go to infect but accidentally punch her. Oops. I had taken anonymush. Derek and I both had infector.</p><p>People are online in c1. They notice something mushy happening. Andie comes and kills Janice (blaming her death on the mush), then starts on Hua. Frieda comes and attacks Hua. Then, Chun comes, finally killing the first beta. {edit} - a grenade mysteriously appeared in BD {/edit}. He threw it but Chun was quick to leave first. I kill Andie. Derek seeks the safety of Ian who dies at the next cycle.</p><p>Terrence takes demoralise and uses it on Eleesha. He also spikes and transfers into Stephen.</p><p>Eleesha dies from 0 morale. I try to kill Gioele, but fail shooting myself. Get liver problems. I head to lab to see who was there and vomit. I take a bed in medlab. Chun read the medic magebook and fixed me up. I pay her back by shooting her but unable to kill. Stephen does the job nicely.</p><p>The 10 hunters appearing in late d3 shoot the hull down quite a bit. Another 7 join them. By d4c7, we are at 3 hull.</p><p>Boom.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/10444">The End</a></p>

                <p>That's what hiding is for (not in storage though).</p><p>I noted your final words. If Raluca had been active, and Jin Su was a competent player, we might have played for the longer game, but as is, Pilgred was unlikely. Sometimes, players do not notice the room logs. We had hoped to convert Janice (she was also a diplomat which could have been handy) but that was not to be. The rampage itself wasn't all that impressive.</p>

                <p>I was actually quite surprised Andie chose Janice to kill first (and it annoyed us the blame on her death was wrongly placed on the mush). Bravo dorm had 4 mushes (3 visible) with a fifth person in the room. In general, unless I'm absolutely sure of a shrink's mushiness (what if I'm wrong as a human), I give the benefit of the doubt. In general, ships do not last long without a shrink. If I had been the human Andie coming across that situation, I might have targeted Derek - if wrong, we lose a wrestler/hygienist.</p>
