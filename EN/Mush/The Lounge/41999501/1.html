He just hoveled up in the Refectory while the rest of the crew was busy with busyness (we had a lot of Hunters and stuff breaking right from the first day) and we didn't notice anything anomalous until we ran out of rations at just day 4. He just...ate everything, and the rest he cooked it and let it rot in his inventory. And now I think I'll have to huff some ammonia to get the image of a swelling, balloonish Stephen sitting in the corner of the Refectory out of my brain. But anyway, the ship was Mush free by day 5. The beginning of a promising adventure, right?</p><p>...well, not quite. Frieda and Janice went inactive, oxygen supplies were running out, and I read the Astro book to try (and fail) to scan for an Oxygenated planet.<br>But right when we were down to just a few breaths of oxygen, there came a trader that offered to trade a crewmate for some Oxygen. Smelling a good deal, I call Polyvalent Gold Andie to the bridge, and sure enough, they offer to trade us 16 units of Oxygen for 7 units of Fuel! Great!</p><p>But the problem was...with 2 units of Oxygen left in the reservoirs, an unstable situation with hunters (Hua and Roland had just expended a lot of AP to get rid of the last wave) and Paola that wasn't showing signs of activity. The decision had to be taken, to save the entire ship I had to ask the knife-happy Jin Su (who also had killed our two Mushes) to execute my own daughter. Andie took control of the Comms center and we were given two day's worth of oxygen.</p><p>Then, good news finally started. I found a planet that had both fuel and oxygen, and almost every other (of 16) zones was a food source. We came back with tons of meat, extra Oxygen, and several fruits among which was the Jumpkin! Ian started planting and pretty much everyone started dropping in to water the plant once or twice a day.</p><p>But, in spite of Andie finding the Plasma Shield with a NERON upgrade, after day 10 (day in which I had scanned a 6-zone planet with Crystalite and very low danger) the Hunter waves got way too brutal for us. They tore through the Plasma Shield and asteroids were going to destroy us. With little time to spare, Jin woke up and returned us to Sol.</p>

                <p>Hey all, Andie here.</p><p>That was a really tough ride. I was literally tasked to do quite a lot on such a small ship, and it made all my AP go bye-bye.</p><p>All said, I was glad to help new players play, but we did have far too many inactives to the point that Stephen junking all our food totally slipped us. I'm ready for a more active ship after so many inactive ones. I'll be back to 'any' play after a while though, so you guys might see me again...</p>
