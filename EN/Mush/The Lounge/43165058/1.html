                <p>Hi, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/roland.png" alt=":mush_roland_50:" class="tid_ico"> Roland here.</p><p>the ship got destroyed not long ago:<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6300" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6300</a></p><p>Around 5 TE people managed to enter that ship, so I added the abbrevation.<br>In my opinion the ship started very great and I had fun doing RP, especially with Janice. I think we had a relationship which could have developed much further...</p><p>Antimush research was actually rather quick, therefore even more kudos to the alpha mush Janice who did later manage to get a betamush fully on her own. I think she had the infector skill.</p><p>As Roland I had either to save aps or to use them by shooting/collecting. My chat participation was rather high, I did mostly some eh.. sexual jokes regarding Janice. My mush hunting participation was not too big.<br>Though at beginning of day 3 i thought that we had only 1 active mush and that it could have been either Jin Su, Frieda, Janice or Hua.<br>Suddenly and with not much evidences Hua killed Janice. Mainly because Janice kicked her out of bed, later she revealed some more reasonings - that Janice took gold and did not much relays.</p><p>At that point ship went downhill incredible fast, especially after another rush acting. Hua did encourage Chun to kill Terrence and Chun did just order in main chat to kill him. I also had some suspicions about terrence and have told Hua and Derek about my suspicions because Janice did push Terrence around before she was killed, so i thought he coudl have been the only person who she could have infected without problems. And noone had told me at that point that there was a defacing in Alpha dorm at d3c1.<br>With a bit more thinking about the situation, especially since Janice did confide in Andie after the defacing happened it should have been clear that Janice was able to convert Andie and had no spores left to also convert Terrence (moving of Janice and Terrence was after defacing). <br>But hindsight is always 20/20. So Terrence was killed wrongly and we lost our only technician... because of stupid rushing.</p><p>The killing of Terrence was human's downfall. And also Raluca. Seriously, she just died of demoralization (and finished the wrong project though we had plasma shield in neron's core) though Janice did comfort her at beginning of game and..with SCHROEDINGER in her inventory, she probably didn't even caress the cat. And told noone about her morale issues.</p><p>Pilgred was at 20% at that time, with Derek I discussed a bit whether andie is betamush or not. I think we could have had a chance if we would have just killed Andie. That chun did openly say andie that she intends to use RFS on her when it is done was also not very smart. I told Derek that if andie is mush she will rampage probably, but I thought at that time somehow that we would be doomed either way (consider it was 4 am for me), so I just went to sleep. Now I think I shoudl have told Derek to just kill her and then we probably would have had a hard time, but probably it would have still be possible for humans to win the game. Very slowly and very painfully though with pilgred progresses of always only one percent and if hunter waves wouldn't have been too big since we lost plasma shield <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>(In the end Andie did really a rampage where she killed her old body and me. Hua (her new body after transfer) was killed by humans).</p><p>I wished game would have been longer and I would have liked to see whether we would have got Janice even without that rushed killing.<br>All in all I did enjoy the game still very much, it was very intense, made fun (especially RP) and much lessons learned. I woudl just hope that also Patryk/Hua would learn/accept to learn a bit and would rather not always rush killings in the future, he was lucky with Janice, but the (encouraged) killing of Terrence was in the end our doom.</p>

                <p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> Janice here! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>The moment I realised I was the first one to wake up, I <strong>knew</strong> this was going to be a good ship. When I was selected as MUSH? Even moreso.</em></p><p>Now, before I start saying random stuff about this ship, I'll tell yous my skills.</p><p>Human: Shrink, IT Expert, NERON's only friend and Diplomat.<br>MUSH: Fertile (love it), Splashproof, Defacer and annonymush.</p><p>I was the first one up, and sung myself a song as to how alone I was... Well, that clearly didn't last long. As with all the Janice's I play most of the men aboard were already talking to me and wanting to be more then friends. (Want help back into that friend zone sperbi? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) Of course, being enlisted as the ships shrink forbid me from such actions, so I made casual side glances at Paola. (We all know why! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">) While I did enjoy roleplaying the out of control Shrink claiming everyone was sexually frustrated, I think I enjoyed manipulating you all moreso. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/three_mush.png" alt=":mush_three_mush_1:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As Alpha MUSH, I was harshly disappointed to receive an inactive as my partner. But, that didn't stop me from trying did it? Eleesha was inactive from the get-go, which was also a good thing since I wouldn't have to worry about the list. A good Janice always takes any opportunity to get morale, and I knew it would start looking suspicious when I didn't. One banana here <em>could</em> help, but not confiding in Andie would probably get the alarm bells ringing sooner or later. It was about D2, while in the lab I noticed there was no camera or alarms in there, and I had 2 targets. Inactive Gioele, or Andie. Pretty obvious choice if you ask me. I stuck in one spore that I had taken out earlier with my dorm swap and moved off as if nothing had happened.</p><p>I watched the research percentages slowly rise as I turned off my PC for the day. Things were not looking good. I reset one of my characters in the hope of having enough XP for infector, but to no avail. <em>IF</em> I did have enough XP, I could've had a partner earlier. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> At this point I only had Fertile and Splashproof and I woke up and saw mycos done, I knew I had no choice but to choose Defacer.. &lt;/3 It was D3C8 (I could be getting my days mixed up, so keep that in mind) when I made my move. I didn't know where Andie was, but I was in B Dorm and I could only hope she was in A Dorm with the camera. Just to my liking, she was. I knew there would be a big gap in my AP usage by the time I did the conversion and what really pissed me off was that nobody was around to relay when I was, thus my IT points weren't being used. I didn't bother defacing twice, hoping there was nobody awake in the dorm, and to my luck there wasn't. About 2 minutes to cycle change, I popped in the first spore. The constant refreshes kept my heart racing and cycle change ticked over. I put in another spore, defaced the room then ran off to the bridge/lab. After checking the trades I noticed 4 dots in A Dorm and I knew somebody was looking. I went to the lab to check my infection then pretended I had 1 spore to throw them off course. Don't actually know if it worked, but it was worth a shot I suppose. What really put the bullet in my leg was when Jin went inactive. I was initially planning on converting somebody then using them as a scape-goat so Andie and I could get off scott free, most likely Hua since she was being stupidly suspicious. (We were days in and she STILL hadn't selected her skills. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico">) I helped Terrence move around a bit before I hopped off for that point in time.</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Mush Chat</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Andie: Dammit! I thought it was you! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></span></span></p><p>With Andie awake, our scheming commenced. We both decided to use that (somewhat useless) Hua as a scape-goat, by finishing the mush soap and pretending to wash our spores out, then defacing the room, converting her, then checking our spores and pretending Andie had +1. I told Andie to claim she had 2 spores on her now and I hoped the humans would buy it, but only time would tell. For 2 cycles almost, the entire chat was complete silence, and it was really driving me insane. I knocked Hua off the bed for Terrence and Gioele got rid of the newy inactive Jin and I headed off to bed hoping to wake up in one piece.</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">NERON</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Janice is dead. Cause: Assasinated.<br>(<em>RIP sexual frustration.</em>)</span></span></p><p>So, 'apparently', without consulting the crew, Hua went out and murderlurdled me simply because I knocked her off her bed. (I mean come on, STILL no skills and a tech who is working on Plasma Shield is not important enough? Get real.) I read a little more, the poor, innocent Terrence was also slaughtered. &lt;/3 RIP. The crew seemed somewhat demoralized (because I was doing a bad job as a shrink <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> ) but moved on nevertheless. I'm a little disappointed that nobody else rose up in hatred against my death, but I'm just going to blame it on the sexual frustration. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> I'm not really sure what happened next since I jumped onto a ship with an IRL friend (successful, nevertheless) so my champion beta Andie should fill in the rest of the details. So glad the damage was done, I couldn't have chosen a better beta. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">NERON</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">I had big plans for this ship. And so did you dear Janice. But alas, the story came to an end sooner than I anticipated. [Kzz] Now the pulverized hull has pressed some bad buttons and Rolands Porno is playing on repeat. [Hax!]</span></span></p><p>(ALSO, always wanted to be a Janice MUSH, so glad I finally got my wish! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico">)</p>

                <p><cite>Suddenly and with not much evidences Hua killed Janice. Mainly because Janice kicked her out of bed, later she revealed some more reasonings - that Janice took gold and did not much relays.</cite></p><p>Oh lordy this "rationale". Nevermind that Hua had zero skills til she finally had to shoot some hunters in the middle of day 3, that she ate before even checking to see if a scrap run was needed then got pissed at Roland for having the audacity to do a scrap run. (OMG and announce it even! Terrible player, that Roland! Terrible!) Hua was nothing other than a liability on this ship and we really should have taken her out. Ironically, Roland was the one that urged the rest of us to slow down and not be so hasty.</p><p>Anyway, Beta-Andie here. Janice turned me just as I was getting ready to go to bed so I wasn't super smart about how I played things at first. I did tell her in IRC (I had figured out who a few of our TE players were, but didn't know everyone by a long shot) that if she confided in me, that I could creatively edit the logs. I didn't expect her to confide so soon after the conversion/defacer. Without thinking long term, I chose to "not see" the confession before I went to bed because otherwise I'd have noticed the lack of logs prior to that, so I went to bed and by the time I woke up, at lot of the damage had been done.</p><p>Within the last cycle or two, Hua had singlehandedly decided to murder Janice and announce that it was only because Janice had knocked her off of a bed. Mush or not, I was pretty livid and more so when none of the TE folks seemed the least bit put out by it and made it well known. It made the end of the ship all that much more satisfying. But we'll get there.</p><p>One of the things I woke up to in the morning was Chun telling me in the mush hunt chat that she knew I was mush and used the fact that I hadn't relayed Janice's confession as 100% proof. I wrote it off with a comment about now knowing that going to bed irl was mushy activity, then pasted the log I had doctored last night. If I had been more awake on either side of sleep, I'd have tried to frame Hua... but 4 hours of sleep wasn't my friend and I knew I had boxed myself in.</p><p>I started to hatch a plan to take out Chun in a rampage and doom the crew to short morale-less lives, but in conversations with an unnamed conspirator (who wasn't on my ship), we realized that all the techs were dead and there were only 3 pilots left. Me, Roland and Hua. My gold time had expired so I only had two skills to play with but could do fertile/transfer combo to jump into a new body for more AP. I could very likely take out Roland and Hua before being taken out myself. Roland had just gone hunter killing the previous cycle but (shockingly) Hua had been fairly useless for the last few cycles. I knew she'd have some AP banked, so the plan was hatched. I'd shower a few times to get my own health really low, kill Roland, jump into Hua, kill Andie. Lizaro Jungle was already in alpha dorm shelf where they were both sleeping, but soap was in the dorm. I'd end up converting 1ap to go get the soap, but it was worth it when considering that I'd need multiple showers to get low enough.</p><p>So off I went to get the soap, went and showered a few times and started smacking on Roland. He apparently had quite a bit of health and took forever to go down. I had a few AP left and was getting uncomfortably close to out of AP so pulled my spore, jabbed Hua, verified no AP to transfer and ran myself out of AP hitting Roland. Bastard still wasn't dead. I jumped into Hua and... whoa. She's holding the knife! At this point I decided to prioritize targets and stabbed Andie til my beautiful former body was dead. Wasn't sure I'd get Roland dead at this point but had 4ap left when I realized I had totally forgotten Lizaro! I meant to hit Roland with that at the start! So I shoot him once with that and get two more stabs in and he's finally dead.</p><p>Now I'm left with 1ap about 30 min before cycle change. The ship was eerily quiet so decided to lay down (wasn't much else I could really do anyway) to see if by some miracle I could get two more AP and take Gioele out after cycle change. At the very least, I could do some more damage.</p><p>Shortly after that, I get a ping in IRC from the player behind Gioele congratulating me on a well played rampage and stating that he's on his phone and can't do much at the moment. We chat and laugh and when he logs off I tell everyone else that if I make it through cycle change, I've got a lizaro and two stabs with his name on them so he better hope he gets to a computer soon!</p><p>In the meantime, I decide to do the "for delzoup" cry, but I like her too much to sully her name by dedicating human kills to her so <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spacekadt.com/20141217082518644.png">this happens</a>. Roland had figured out earlier that Hua was being played by Patryk. I'd never had the joy of playing a game with him before, but holy hell did he ever live up to his reputation as a troll so I dedicated his death to, well, everyone.</p><p>Shortly before cycle change, Gioele logged in and succeeded in killing me, which was fine. There were 11 hunters pummeling the ship, the hull was 54 when I died and they lost 16 hull in one cycle change afterward.</p><p>They apparently decided to go for an expo at a volcano planet which took out Gioele, Chun and one other person but I can't remember who. More hunters came and watching Ian and Paola trying to figure out who the last alpha was was somewhat interesting. I hung around as a ghost for a few cycles til the ship finally got destroyed by hunters. They did at least manage to find Eleesha thanks to Ian noticing that she wasn't taking any starvation damage, but it really was great fun watching people and all their (wrong) guesses about who the last mush was.</p>

                <p>I have no time to write a long history, but it was nice ship and I'd like Janice to be human, but I couldn't be reconciled that Janice proved his being as Mush.<br>Roland, she didn't have infector. She stung Andie on day 1. Terrence was killed because he was supposed to notice defaced logs as he probably knew when I went to bed if he supposed me to have it full, although I didn't have. After he was killed, I was wondering if Janice used day change trick and infected twice Andie then. I suspected Roland because he was wandering in Rear Corridor in the same time as deface, I wasn't sure when I examined one of his Patrol Ship.<br>I'll read all your history and put my one when I have more time and calm to put it.

I was on the fence when I saw that Paola was available - a character that I know well, that would be minimally involved in the mush hunt, and was not super high maintenance on the early days of the ship.</p><p>My couch was set up quickly, and in no time I was lounging around on the sofa, occasionally hitting buttons at my leisure. I was not pulled into the mush hunt, but I was sucked into the role play - Janice was hit on by several of the male crew, and then she would nudge them in my direction. This ended up in situations where Roland was hitting on Janice while asking me out - seeming to be open to any sort of affection. I was having a lot of fun with the crew, interacting with my "dad" in particular.</p><p>We had won at human pinball, moving the innactive Stephen to storage, and Janice was going to meet up with me on cycle 8 to trade him for 20 fuel. Then we got a massive wave of hunters for so early (like 15 or so), Roland took a bunch out, and then Hua ... didn't go kill hunters and killed Janice instead. ( I think spacey that it made a difference in how I got the nebulous messages - the first one I read was Hua saying something like "I knew she was mush" and from the comments I thought she had been talking to Chun about her suspicions, but had decided to go ahead and kill Janice without further permission. She also said something like, "There are 4 pilots but only 1 mush hunter." Which was rather insulting, because in theory it's a team effort. Also, from that point to the end of the game, we never did get rid of all the hunters and our ship did eventually blow up from it.</p><p>I was distracted by RL for a bit, and when I came back Terrence was dead, this time by group effort - but Terrence was human. I pushed some more buttons, and tried to do Paola's job. Still, things were not looking good - we lost our tech and our Plasma shield, and the hunters were still there.</p><p>The problem with not participating at all in the mush hunt is that you really can't blame anyone when things go to hell, because you're not helping either. So the next morning when I logged in and found all the pilots dead and us hovering over volcano world, ready to do a suicide jump to get 02, I can't really say that I did anything substantial from stopping us from getting that far. In the time it took me to drive to work, three of my fellow crewmates fell into a volcano.</p><p>But there was still a glimmer of hope! Gold-pilot-but-innactive Jin came alive, saying he was at 2 moral. There was a trader outside! If we did a group effort to clear the hunters, maybe I could trade Stephen for something useful and we could limp home. However, Jin just stood on the bridge, and that cycle our trade body died in storage. Next cycle Ian logiced out that Eleesha had to be our remaining mush, and I murdered her (looks like shooter points are good for Lizaro too! ) and layed down in the medlab where she had been idling. Shortly after this, Jin moved the ship, commissioned me to do the deed with him and stood in the medlab. Well, I was short on moral anyway, and maybe then he'd get about shooting down the hunters.</p><p>However, Frieda died of moral loss, leaving just Ian, JS and I alive. The captain never moved again. Ian moved to the lab to be with his beloved plants one more time - and the ship exploded.</p>

                <p>Gioele here. Overall, this was a fine ship, short and sweet. First time playing Gioele, so it was nice to experiment with his personality and how he would act in RP. I also got to kill at least 3 people, which is always good.</p><p>It was great to finally share the ship with two people I had been in IRC contact with for a long time (Andie and Paola), especially because I didn't know who Paola was until after I died.</p><p>However, I must admit I was pretty disturbed by Janice's and Roland's interactions, particularly Roland being revolting to read. Overall it was fine from a writing/role-playing standpoint, and I assume I must simply be missing something; after all, I don't really understand the fun and joy in roleplaying a sexual harasser and generally massive creep.</p><p>I do not mind a flirt, particularly not a tasteful one, but our Roland was desperately talking about sex throughout the WHOLE round, and limited his play exclusively to pestering any woman he could find. Sigh.</p><p>Similar concerns appeared with Janice and her uncontrollable tic to add 'sexually' in random sentences everywhere, though she was comparatively tame and restrained otherwise.</p><br><p>Overall this ship reminded me of when Episode 2 was announced, and I stated concerns about the weird focus on Doing the Thing with mechanics like Pregnancy, Virgin trait etc., and predicted it would spawn much more creepy borderline-ERP.</p><p>But maybe I'm just being an ol' grouch.</p>

                <p>Hi, there's <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hua.png" alt=":mush_hua_50:" class="tid_ico"> Hua, <em>ie. "still waters run deep"</em>, but finished as <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico"> Andie.</p><p><strong>First moment</strong><br>After my Mush victory from MMM ship <em>(I guess)</em> I decided to join the next ship. Hua and Jin Su left... I wasn't going to be much active, so I became Hua. I didn't have enough time to welcome crew when Jin Su appeared and Mush selected, so first I did was leaving the room. I found Mush Sample in the Front Corridor so I brought it to the Lab, advanced MycoAlarm and Constipaspore Serum, chitchatted with Andie, went to the Bridge trying to estabilish comms and I did this as quick as I forgot about my piloting duties. I needed to sleep. Janice was nice and promised to give me her bed in AD. I convinced crew to make Constipaspore or MycoAlarm as first and after the argument with Chun, they decided to rush CS, but ASG was second, which hurted me so much.</p><p><strong>The best RP ever seen</strong><br>Then, the best moment in this game... <strong>let's RP</strong>. Terrence dismantled the shower, so Derek treated him as a hygiene terrorist. Derek was afraid, so he picked Hygienist skill. Poor for me... I wished her bla-bla speeches. Roland blamed me for no collecting scrap. Ugh... what a clown! He tried to seduce Paola, my heart wanted to get rid of the partner from Merkury, so I told him that they both would find a romantic place staring at the stars from the Bridge. Why to get rid of? Beware Gioele, whose solid muscles aren't jokes. Poor Roland... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"> I took a nap for a while and poof... Janice vomited at Roland: "It'll be better tomorrow, just you wait and you see..." <strong>And the love began!</strong> NERON took care of us, turned on music and Chun was proud of him. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Finish roleplaying, start gameplaying</strong><br>The party finished, and I woke up and realised that I had to get rid of Mush to continue the nice RP. I really wished to get Roland just for me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"> <em>(yeah, it didn't start very well)</em> I thought <strong><em>"If I found the Mush, Roland would kiss me, maybe marry me!"</em></strong> Cycle 8, I had to go soon, but I had just 9 AP. Although Roland managed to collect some scrap earlier than me, I decided to collect the new ones. I went to Refectory, met Stephen AFK. I cooked a ration, left the Refectory and ate the ration getting dirty. I went to Alpha Bay 2 and noticed lack of Pasiphae because Terrence hijacked it and left outside. I reported my dirtyness, Roland blamed me for it, Terrence had told about staying outside and collecting the last scrap. I got nothing but suspicion. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> What did I do? CPU Overlocking had been finished, although Stephen used all AP for useless project, Plasma Shield was to do, I had no reason to do it. Derek had told Kuan Ti, Terrence and Raluca to do this project. Nothing but research left for me. I went to the Lab. CS was done. Antispore Gas was at 42%, MycoAlarm wasn't touched. Andie helped a lot with CS and reported ASG at 42%. I saw Janice in the Lab. I asked myself <strong><em>"What is she doing? No research...</em></strong> Later... <strong><em>"Wait, she has Gold Mode!</em></strong> I bumped ASG as much as possible and went back to bed. I was wondering why Janice bought Gold Mode if she promised to buy this if crew went well. I saw no benefits from Diplomat right then, and something was fishy, because Gold Mode for that time wasn't worth, but a bit useless. The one reason she bought the Gold Mode was 2 additional Mush slots. Yeah... I suspected her as Mush right then. <strong><em>"So she wanted to give me a bed to make an excuse to claim the bed in Bravo Dorm without getting any suspicion, stealth the shower!"</em></strong> She promised to do some research in the next cycle if someone relayed, but it was day change, and Andie was in the Lab without camera. I saw Janice's attempt to spike Andie twice. Andie went to Alpha Dorm before day change, and before day change Janice said "I watered and treated all bananas. Ian, why didn't you do this? It's your work!" And it was suspicious that she told "<strong>all</strong> bananas", I saw this word "all" as something like "Uhhhh... I spent ALL my AP in watering and treating these bananas. I'm exhausted right now." There were 4 bananas, 2 of them were young, and it was day 1, so the young ones weren't thirsty. She didn't use 8 AP on plants as she wanted us to think, but... just 2-6 AP. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"> And the day change didn't happen, when Janice moved all these plants to the Garden because of project called Hydroponic Incubator. She estabished comms which Paola had broken trying to contact Xyloph, took Mush Genome Disk to the Lab <em>(I did the same thing in my previous ship as Mush, it was useless without dead Mush)</em> and came back to Alpha Dorm. I invited Chun and Andie because I trusted them. I told my suspect about Janice. I invited Andie because I thought Janice had chitchatted in the Lab, so it'd be confusing after extracting spores, she looked suspicious but this chitchat... Chun put her on "suspect" list, but I said that it'd be "sure" list if I found out that she wasn't investigating. No PILGRED advances from her, so she probably didn't walk in rear part of ship.</p><p><strong>On the trail of Janice</strong><br>A few cycles later no hunters outside, so no reason to take Pilot skill. I continued research. I went to the Lab to know when Janice chitchatted with Andie, but wait... I thought wrong! <strong>Janice didn't chitchat with Andie!</strong> She comforted Chun instead. She didn't even access the Research Tab, so no research advances from her. <em>By that time, she had worked on CPU Overlocking using 4 IT points (don't be confused with 8 AP), watered 2 bananas a treated probably one. She estabilished comms using 2 AP because it was before day change.</em> Result: if she hadn't walked around the ship to investigate, she was a Mush. ASG was finished so I helped Chun with MA and finished even without ration I had. I invited Gioele to Mush hunt. He killed Kuan Ti (I knew he hadn't Mush, just newbie) getting Gastroenterisis. I wished he had used muscles to kill the Mush. I don't know why I didn't invite Derek. Maybe he didn't have free slots right then. I told Chun that Janice was Mush and Andie had 1 spore. I really wished her alive because her skills were OP and very needed for us. I told Chun that it was her decision with she wanted to hold Janice alive and try to find and kill the second Mush and RFS her, or just kill her. 2 cycles later I helped a bit with Mycoscan, making sure that Janice hadn't done so much. I went to the Bridge and checked Paola's advances. Radio was available, so I checked offers... and items in storages <em>(my favorite thing)</em>. Knife, Blaster and Grenade still in storage. Yeah, they were still somewhere in 5 storages. I checked AstroPad. Strange... Once I had checked I saw some stuff in CAS. There was the Knife then, but I didn't remember very well. I wanted to make it sure. On the way to CAS I checked each logs to find Janice's movement. She was walking around Front Corridor a bit times because of banana trees and Mush Genome Disk. I checked Central Corridor and Alpha Bay - nothing, she went through just once. I checked CAS and searched. I found the knife. I told Chun and others in private that Knife and other stuff had been hidden here. Andie reported that she'd been there, updated AstroPad and it was empty, she wanted to find the fire and couldn't remember who had been there. If I was Eleesha... I thought that Janice had been wandering around Alpha Bay in the beginning. I was surprised, really surprised. <strong><em>"Why would Janice hide all the stuff if her aim was to infect the crew, not to destroy ship. She wants to hold this ship, but this knife... an emergency if something went wrong or what?"</em></strong> I totally didn't understand what had happened. I had thought I knew all about Janice, but this? It's really weird for this RPing Mush which Janice was. Andie wanted crew to hold all the stuff, one item per person. I ordered Chun to hide them, no even proven human because the Mush might have converted them. Fully exhausted, I went to sleep.</p>

                <p><strong>An important decision</strong><br>In the next day, I noticed myself to stand, not to sleep. Why? Because Janice hit me. The Mush suspect hit me! I was reading all that chat. Terrence wanted nobody else but Hua to be hit because he wanted her bed. I got angry because I had important job of piloting, no skills picked, but I was still the pilot to choose. I noticed 10 hunters outside, but I wasn't supposed to have full AP, Terrence allegedly supposed. Moreover, Janice was sleeping there, when she's doing nothing but extracting spores and infecting <em>(I realized how efficient CS was)</em>. <strong>She was like a spore machine!</strong> Nobody talked in Mush hunt channel. I saw they suspected me. It was OK. But <strong>when I checked CAS and the Knife was still there</strong>, I realised that there wasn't Mush hunt, there was a... something terrible <em>(I won't tell this word)</em>! I took the knife and went back to Alpha Dorm. I wanted to attack her around cycle change, so I'd eat a ration before cycle change and refill my AP a bit by lying in the bed.</p><p><strong>What a monster would kill Janice?</strong><br>I clicked at her and was staring at this button "Attack: Knife (60%)". I looked at these sweet hearts flying over her, and her sexy costume... and these sweet things she had talked. I asked myself: <strong><em>"What a monster would kill her?"</em></strong> But she laid in the bed innocently. Why?... Why is it Janice? Why the Mush converted her? Why? But everybody loves her, nobody would touch her. Cycle change was coming. I saw the Medikit in shelving-unit. I picked it up and looked at Janice. She wasn't wounded. Splashproof, because I wouldn't believe in Phagocyte. But it left me in doubt. Gold Janice, but Splashproof? Yeah, everything which helps in converting. I went to the Lab quickly, making sure that she didn't work on Mycoscan so much. I checked logs - Janice accessed the Research Lab 2 times. So her IT Points worked. I checked advances - nothing else, just Mycoscan. I checked myself and I had no spores. I got angry. She was producing spores when I hesitated. Oh no... I came back to Alpha Dorm. Just 1 minute left... but she was so sweet. The queen of RP. No... it's a Mush, let's do this. And I did what I intended. I cut her, as many times as there were lacking 7 AP. When I started to cut her, something screamed in my heart and what I did, it'd change everything forever and it won't be the same as previously. I ate a ration and went to bed. Then I was attacking her, successes and failures. When it was happening, my heart screamed loudly, it told: <strong><em>"WHYYYYYYY? WHY MUSH! WHY JANICE IS A MUSH!!! WHYYY! WHY NOBODY ELSE BUT JANICE. WHY ARE YOU MUSH? WHYYYYY!!! AAAAAAAAAAARGH!"</em></strong> And I just looked at comrade bar, I saw still 2 yellow bodies alive. <strong><em>What?</em></strong> I looked: 3 earned glory, Janice dead, 1 Mush dead. And I whispered myself: <strong><em>"I've got rid of RP - I'm so terrible."</em></strong> Did I kill the wrong person? At the wrong moment? I wanted to face the Mush, I taunted telling that it was because she took my bed. I didn't want to tell the Mush why I did this indeed, preventing them from doing the same mistake and hiding for long days. I just understood that I declared war on Mush.</p><p><strong>Under the pressure of epidemic</strong><br>I was wondering how Janice managed to infect Andie. I noticed logs defaced. They were shown since day 3 cycle 2. On day 3 cycle 2 Janice chitchatted with Andie, after defacing logs and converting someone, so I was sure Andie was Mush. I told this Chun. She said that she didn't want to lose her only morale support, so she wanted to RFS her. RFS was really needed, but I was scared that Janice didn't act alone, but somebody helped her. I checked logs in Alpha Bay and Rear Corridor. Roland and Terrence were wandering around on day 3 cycle 1. I was afraid that the Mush would convert me, I informed Chun all that. I thought they would convert me tonight, so we needed to remove the second Alpha Mush before the day change. But who? Terrence or Roland, Terrence or Roland... I was afraid of Terrence because he was gold, Roland was just a silver. Then Roland told me some suspects about Terrence, that he might have been Beta Mush. Now I trusted Roland and thought Terrence was Mush, I informed Roland about Andie and deface. I just looked at logs on day 3 cycle 2, Terrence was active, and told that I was at full AP and wanted me to be kicked from the bed. <strong>It was all on day 3 cycle 2!</strong> I told Chun that Terrence should have read these defaced logs and used Defacer. It was sneaky Mush or blind human, but gold lvl3 and he looked experienced, so "blind human" distinction removed, to kill him just left. Gioele killed Terrence oddly, because first kicked him out and then off to death. Roland followed Gioele and looked at this combat. Terrence was human, but Roland Mush? I wasn't sure if Roland was Mush. I looked at these logs again. Well... these logs were defaced on day change, Janice might have converted Andie twice alone. I thought Defacer was bugged and this made using it more difficult. Oh well...</p><p><strong>Unsolved case</strong><br>I tried to convince Raluca to make Plasma Shield, the others seemed to force her. She made Spatial Wave Radio instead. I told in chat that she was the only physicist. In Mush hunt channel, where Gioele, Andie and Chun were, I told them that Raluca was Mush but the only person to repair PILGRED so we needed RFS for her. I told just Chun that Raluca was newbie, not Mush, and she didn't need RFS, it was for Andie. I went to Refectory, ate a ration and went to Bravo Bay <em>(I supposed Roland a bit to trap Bravo Dorm just for me)</em>. Roland was there. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"> Nevermind, I checked one of Patrol Ships, it was full of charges, so I took off and shot, unfortunately, just 2 hunters. I landed. Then I examined 2 remaining Patrol Ship to check if Roland really shot some hunters if pretended to be lack of AP and shot few times. I checked one, it was full, and the last one, it had 3 charges. Roland had taken off the Patrol Ship 3 cycle before. Roland used all charges to shoot hunters. Maybe no ration, but shooting points and almost full AP needed. Then I was totally confused. Was Roland a Mush? I went to sleep in Bravo Dorm, just Roland was there, so I was afraid. And I was afraid that the Mush would punish me.</p><p>And it has happened.</p>

                <p>To be honest, I was almost overflowing with AP half the time, but never had anywhere to use it. I go to the lab for relays; nobody is awake to do so/all the relays have been done already. I was barely able to spend my IT points too. I spent most of my extra AP just hugging people, there wasn't anything else I could do...</p><p>And on top of that, I rarely had a bed. 8 AP a day is a real show-stopper.

Seems like you did enjoy the ship very much too despite the conflicts we had regarding your actions. Also against the impression you made on the ship it seems that you felt bad for having to kill Janice. I am also glad to hear that!</p><p>You watched janice more carefully and entered lab, I did most pilot job, so I was staying in rear of the ship almost whole time.<br>But I noticed the huge amount of aps Terrence used (collecting aps, advancing palsma shield, going to cook ration, helping with research, etc.). To me it was clear that he was human until day 3. I was suspicious about him only after he went through ship with Janice and when he advanced wrong nexus project which was also after he was together with janice (also he made a little bad thing for a human: one time in nexus he did pick up and drop a mycoalarm).<br>Unfortunately I wasn't in hunt channel with Chun, we coudl have discussed the case Terrence probably better there.</p><p>But plz let me give you a hint: When you want to show people that you are a good mush hunter you also shouldn't play like a mush. Otherwise noone will take you seriously.<br>( I am referring to not choosing any skill at all, your mistake of eating without even taking off despite in pilot thread it was already said that Terrence took already the scrap and even more your suspicious answers/behaviour to our wish of you confiding - when you refused first and when you said these suspicious things (you will be surprised about the results) and you intent of spamming everything with "examine" though that didn't work. It seemed like you were fully oblivious to how suspicious you were acting.)</p>

                <p>OK, thanks for advices. I used to look at logs at first, then do something, skipping long messages and its a mistake. Maybe I had too little time then. Sorry Terrence for that, I was a bit paranoid that this knife and rampage for emergency. I thought Mush wanted to convert all pilots then rampage, and you were one of them, I thought that Terrence extracted a spore when he got exhausted while collecting scrap, and got Andie then... Sorry for all that.<br><span class="tid_wspoil">Btw this Chun was completely irresponsible. She didn't mention that Terrence hid the knife and all stuff.</span></p>
