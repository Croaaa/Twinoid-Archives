This was an amazing trip folks, with lots of nailbiting moments. I can't believe we pulled off a 10-day return to sol victory. We really pulled it all together - finishing the pilgred from less than half and finishing the cure from scratch in a single day. Our jumpkin-fueled victory, however, seems to have lead to the rise of a new thread... and our new Jumpkin overlords quickly took control of the ship and claimed victory for themselves. Hopefully they will be more benevolant tyrants than the Mush were.</p><p>Great job everyone, I would be honored to find myself on the same ship with you folks again.</p><p>And I am so happy I didn't let you guys kill Terrence!</p>

Sadly Jumpkins have a short shelf life past Jelloween.

                <p>Hey guys, Hua here. As you may have thought, I was a bit bummed after being the one to suffocate right before leaving to get more O2 (I think my final words were "Get in! We are leaving now!" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>But at least that finally solved the O2 mystery for me. - From this game and the last, I can now say for sure that <em>someone dies the moment it hits 0</em>. Meaning you are actually better off having 0 in the tank than 1 (and a capsule in your hand), because that last one only gets consumed with no saving effect!</p><p>Anyway, I am glad to hear the journey did not end there after that successful Mush investigation, and that you made it even though the other planets had really screwed us over. Well done! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Oh man, Hua! I really enjoyed playing with you, and was so upset when you died! I think we worked really well together, me and you, and we could have made it a lot further with you aboard. Definitely add me to your friends list, when castings come out I definitely want to play with you again! You restored my faith in Hua after my experience on what was apparently <em>our</em> previous ship. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Here's the log from the expedition right after your death:</p><p><strong>Janices Reports</strong> <br>I am not entirely sure I will survive this expedition. My arm... my arm is gone. Luckily, it was my left one, allowing me to write normally, and so to keep my mind off the pain, writing is what I will do, when we stop to catch our breaths. I do not regret coming, though - things are looking dire for the crew.If we fail here today, the rest of us will surely follow poor Hua. Serpent's Feathers, Hua, how could you leave us? You were my best friend, my staunchest ally, and a sorely needed voice of reason about this ship. Far beyond the value you offered with your inque skillls was the value you had as a human being, and even now losing you has proven far more painful than losing my arm. We will succeed, though. We will fight. We will not let your death be in vain. ~2h</p><p><strong>Janice : </strong>We have lost Terrence. He has spent most of his time on this ship doing his own thing, going left when he should have been going right, so this should come as no suprise. He also banged me up pretty badly on our way down - he swore he knew how to pilot the Icarus, but it certainly didnt look that way to me. All the same, he was a vital member of the crew - hopefully a terrible fate has not befallen him. ~2h</p><p><strong>Terrence : </strong>What the hell are you telling about?! Come for me oh my gosh! ~2h</p><p><strong>Janice : </strong>As we walk through this sweltering heat, my mind turns to the ship. What must those still on board be thinking right now? I know the Captain was becoming depressed even before we lost Hua, and he must be taking her death hard - I should console him when we return. Comfort him. But I am not sure I will be able. As much as I hate myself for it, I can not help but blame him for Hua's death. No one had to die, but his mistakes... No. I can not think like this. As much as the thought of spending time with that man disgusts me, I must keep such feelings to myself. I will do my duty. We must hold together and persevere. I only pray that Kuan Ti recovers from his coma soon. We need you, KT. I need you. ~2h</p><p><strong>Janice : </strong>Even now, I can almost pretend I hear Terrence's voice on the wind, telling us to remember him. You will be missed, Terrence. ~2h</p><p><strong>Terrence : </strong>At least i wouldn't die of Asphyxia as you will. I will find some monkey and make an act of unity with that female... So... Humanity will survive... And you will die... ~2h<br><strong><br>Janice : </strong>The expedition has ended... at least for now. The ground nearly threatened to swallow us up - only Chun's premonition, warning us to return immediately to the ship, saved our lives. Chao took the controls and returned us to the Daedalus, but we won't be here long - Jin Su will be joining us in a few moments, and then it's back once more down to the planets surface. ~1h</p><p><strong>Janice : </strong>The Captain, for all his faults, certainly knows how to pilot a ship. We landed without incident this time, and in the desert outside the craft we spotted several large ruminants - Chao told us to stay down, and blaster at the ready skulked off through the dunes. Less than 10 minutes later, he came back dragging an enormous and delicious looking carcass, which we immediately tossed in the ship. We were all hungry, but we have other priorities at the moment. ~1h</p><p><strong>Jin Su :</strong> The damn spider bit me where it counts, I can't see very clearly. Luckily I can fly this bird with my eyes closed, we'll get back to the ship with all hands or my name isn't Jin Kirk!... Su!<br>I think this venom is making me hallucinate. 49min</p><p><strong>Janice :</strong> Praise Eden, we've managed to gather two days worth of o2. We might just pull this off - although without Hua, who knows how long it will last. I'm urging the Captain to hurry this up, but he's insisting the people on the Daedalus will last a bit longer and, of course, he wants to take a look around before we leave. We're a good distance from the Icarus regardless, but Neron estimates our plotted route should get us back before anyone else dies. Let's hope he's right. Also, I forgot to mention this, but while we were preparing for the second expo, Finola gave me a very cross look and took to tending my injuries. She couldn't save the arm, but at least I'm not bleeding everywhere anymore, and the transfusion and medication she gave me has me feeling just great. Physically. Mentally, I was still feeling miserable until the whole o2 thing. Now I'm feeling pretty hopeful too. 46min</p><p><strong>Janice : </strong>No sooner did I finish writing about how hopeful I was, when things began to turn south again. Jin Su isn't looking so hot - had some alien arachnid jab him a few times, and it was clearly carrying a potent toxin. He insists he's fine, and that the mission must go on, and also that he is totally capable of flying the ship, but when I ran him through a few minor tests for mental clarity he had... difficulties. It took him multiple tries to successfully remember his own name! We've still got quite a hike ahead of us though... hopefully the effects are temporary, and he'll be in a good enough condition to fly by the time we return. 44min</p><p><strong>Janice : </strong>The recent march through barren wasteland has taken it's toll on all of us, but I think the Captain has gone feverish. The cargo we carry is far too precious for us to fail now, so we're pushing through, but part of me is afraid the worst is yet to come. We're only half an hour out from the ship, now. Just half an hour more... 42min</p><p><strong>Jin Su : </strong>The damn Aliens are all against us. They always fight when we ask for the crystals... the lovely bright crystals... Who knew there were so many aliens in space? I didn't come this far to be foiled by aliens. #starts waving a dirty t-shirt around# Come on you bastards, I'm ready for you!# 21min</p><p><strong>Janice : </strong>We should really make the white flag. Maybe they'll stop trying to kill us if we surrender pre-emptively? 20min</p><p><strong>Janice : </strong>The march through the desert continues. We came across a tribe of primitive beings, and things seemed to be going well at first - but when the Captain, in his fevered state, started gesturing wildly while going on about how we needed their crystals, the aliens must have taken it as a sign of hostility, because they attacked! We fought them off, though we suffered some injuries, but the sun continues to wear us down far more than the fight did. 18min</p><p><strong>Janice : </strong>The Captain, thankfully, has begun to recover and think clearly again. We encountered another one of the alien creatures, injured and weak. The Captain shared some of his water with the creature, and with a little medical attention from Chun is was up and active again in short order. Though we could not understand what it was saying, it pushed a gift on to us before disappearing into the wastes - a mount, I suppose, although like none I've seen before. It seems to be a type of sentient boulder, complete with saddle, and the Captain is already hard at work bonding with his new pet rock. 9min</p><p><strong>Janice : </strong>The rest of the trip to the Icarus was uneventful, except for our arrival - where we found Terrence, looking smug and impatient, already strapped into one of the passenger seats and ready to go home. He seemed quite cross on the trip back to the Daedalus, and kept muttering something about a blueberry bush. Somehow, are luck held out - Hua may be gone, and she will be missed, but we have survived another day.</p>
