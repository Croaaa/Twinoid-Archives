                <p><span class="tid_strike">Yes, it was a great ship. I got a great partner. Stephen was gold 18lvl Mush, showed me Massive Mushification skill, which he wanted to use on day 5. He's already picked 3 skills and left 4th slot for Anonymush. He was awesome, you would be jelious of him!</span><br>Well, my Mush partner Stephen got caught while being tortured and killed in 3 cycles. Bravo my partner. I didn't expect that Chao would be a Torturer. He's already picked Shooter and Wrestler. I thought that Survivor was a great skill and was so naive to believe he was silver because as gold why would he miss Survivor skill? Chao worked out that Stephen had already infected someone.<br>I'd already prepared for Mush selection, Knife, Hacker Kit and Grenade BP were in RBT. <em>Frieda lectured me that holding the Knife was sanctionable.</em> I also managed to get dirty. Camera weren't installed in any of Dorms, just in the Lab. One of cameras lied in CBS from the beginning to the end of voyage. However, when Stephen got killed, Chao installed camera in Bravo Dorm.<br>Before it happened, we'd already done a few things. Stephen had put a trap on the Bridge which Finola caught. As soon as I noticed that I was selected as Mush, I used the advantage that there were no cameras, made some spores, and decided to put one of them into Chao. Why? Because as I owned the Knife, Chao would be the only trouble for me as the person giving huge damage. I wanted to convert Ian and Finola in the future, for some healings and pacifism, occupy one of rooms and expand infection. Stephen woke up to put another spore and continued sleeping.<br>I was in Alpha Dorm, when Stephen got killed by Chao in Bravo Dorm. Mush selection was on D2C4, Stephen got killed D2C6. I knew Chao was Torturer, so he should've for sure picked Crazy Eyes, and with 2 spores in him, I couldn't imagine they're for nothing. I hoped there was no camera in Bravo Dorm. I went to Bravo Dorm on D3C1, after relaying some projects, because just noticed some people were active on day change and waited a few minutes, then went to Bravo Dorm - camera had been installed. I didn't want to attract much suspicion visiting Bravo Dorm for no reason, so I comforted Chao 4 times to look like morale boost. <em>And no Chao, I didn't comfort you mainly because I wanted to bypass torture. I'd already relayed some projects and accessed terminals. You should've tortured me deeply near death to find my Mush actions. I really believed you could torture me over my comforts.</em><br>I couldn't continue easy infecting despite no cameras, because Chao's Torture skill was too powerful. I was thinking about converting Finola because she didn't stay under camera, but this Chao... Then decided to use Defacer. I cleared logs in the end of D3C4 when I noticed the day before no activity from human crew in cycle 5, just me and Stephen, and Chao in cycle 6. I knew it was worth even if I got detected. Chao had Crazy Eyes, if something went wrong he'd make a great rampage and nobody would stop him without weapon.<br>Chao converted, welcome Chao and have fun.<br><a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/v7z00w/14">&lt;Spazticus' lesson about camera's importance upon Mush selection. Look: paragraph 2&gt;</a><br>Before the cycle ended, I made 2 spores, washed myself with the Soap and didn't take anything from the shelving unit. If somebody noticed lack of something, they'd look at logs and noticed them wiped. Chao was quiet and got annoyed that the person who put the Mush near loss, became one of them. When I told him he had to move and do something to fill the logs, he obediently left the room taking BP and joined dropping Support Drone. But he was quiet, he felt upset and humiliated. When I also helped in filling logs, Frieda came there and noticed nothing. Hua commented about expedition while she was lying in Bravo Dorm bed. Even Roland came, nothing noticed. Logs were filling, infection was spreading. I was proud that I infected the only person who could look at the logs and notice them wiped even as human. My target was perfect.<br>And it was how trustworthy crewmember got infected and Frieda was so naive and believed him all the time, when Chao was an awesome lawyer who hasn't betrayed me and has never tortured me when I claimed I lost HP on torturing, and he lost AP for the same reason - to torture me so much (3-4 HP, depends how water hurts).</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Stephen, I know you're so experienced but please, don't show off that you've got Mashive Mushification when you aren't going to use it. Don't pick Mush skills as soon as you're selected as Mush. Pick when you use them. If you had waited for skills and realized there were no cameras in Dorm, you could've picked Infector skill and convert Chao before he killed you.</span></p>

                <p>Hi, Chao here.<br>Terrence almost ruined everything by taking anonymush when only one mush displayed so killing him and claiming to have eliminated all mush was definitely the right choice even if he didn't like it.<br>It was a fun ship but way too inactive. Also filled with lazy players who never bothered to install the cameras (I mean a camera was in CBS the whole game, multiple people visited it and Roland even told others to install it but no one bothered...). And hopefully Chun will get quarantined soon for xp farming.</p>

                <p>Although I was the last Mush, I didn't give up. Remember: When the piece of Mush is still there, Mush may raise. Look: it happened to me.<br>So I was really happy that Chao was on my side. People believed the person who killed a Mush in very first day. Frieda got Gastroenteritis while witnessing the kill, so Chao and Frieda had private channel where they were talking about Mush suspects. Chao shared reports, Frieda gave him new tasks to do which Chao easily bypassed, I felt free to visit Bravo Dorm to wash my spores and get hurt when Chao claimed that he kept torturing me all the time.<br>Chao told once that I was so much to Frieda and informed me that she suspected me as I didn't tell it in public. As I didn't want to tell "<em>Hey, I am hurt, sorry that so late but Chao informed that Frieda suspected me</em>" I told Finola in private that I wish her to heal me because I was wounded. I was in Alpha Dorm so she came there. And she thought that I was injuried, as I asked Finola, the Medic. Finola was carrying one spore. I told Chao to infect her and he did this instantly. Finola left Alpha Dorm without healing me - rude! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"><br>Next day Chao was going to infect Finola, and I was waiting in the Lab. Told him to convert Finola even if there was camera, I could deface logs so no human would notice. I kept refreshing pages, and then noticed Finola had become Mush "moments before" and Roland had spoken "moments before". I got a bit scared that Chao didn't pick Anonymush in time and Roland noticed this, fortunately I was wrong. We were waiting a few cycles, then Finola sweared. Then took the next half of hour, then she presented a wide range of choices what she could do. She could transfer, she could traitor, she could demoralize... It was her first time as Mush. But I told no rampage, we were going to convert crew, it could be our chance, our opportunity.<br>Finola seemed new for me, so I instructed her one-by-one how to make spores, excuse and then how to convert someone. Jin Su got inactive, so Chao became a commander. Finola visiting Bravo Dorm would be suspicious, but we were team. I went to Bravo Dorm and told Finola to make 2 spores when nobody was in her room, go to Bravo Dorm and wash herself without using the Soap, and heal me as the excuse why she visited Bravo Dorm, possibly heal Terrence as he asked, and go back to the Medlab. I asked Chao to send the mission to Finola to help. Surprisingly, she did her job perfect. I refreshed page and saw Finola with 2 spores <strong>clean</strong> in the Bravo Dorm. She healed me twice (I wished once, because I was lacking just 6 HP), went to Alpha Dorm to heal Terrence and back to the Medlab. I was surprised that she had so much AP.<br>Raluca came to the Bridge to build sofa and promised to return in the next cycle, but she was inactive for a few cycles. I told Finola to spike Raluca that day (day 4) and in the next day to convert her. I'd put second spore. She had to put first, because if she had gone out of Bridge, Finola wouldn't have had any reasons to visit her in rear part of the ship, but I would have. Me spiking first would be a waste if Raluca did this before Finola spiking. Finola asked if 2 spores enough to convert the person. It was the time that I explained her about conversion and repeated many, many, <strong>many</strong> times that after putting 3rd spore she must pick Anonymush because I doubted she would remember. It was cycle 8, Raluca still on the Bridge, Finola didn't infect. Well, I took a risk and did it first, plus comforted her. Finola came and spiked her. There was a problem. As we were on the oxygen planet Frieda had found, I told Finola to check AstroTerminal to check details, as an excuse of visiting the Bridge. She forgot. I didn't want Raluca to attract any suspicion, so I invited her into private conversation and asked her how she was on health. She said she was lacking HP, then I mentioned that Finola told so checking her with the Medikit. It went smoothly, Raluca suspected nothing, went to Engine Room. Waiting the next day, I warned Finola that the most activity was in the day change, so I told her to wait a half of hours and then convert Raluca when activity was distinctly lower.<br>I went back after a few cycles. Raluca became one of us. The next step for Mush victory.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Oh hi Chao. Thank you for this high activity <em>after conversion, of course.</em> Despite low Mush level as I noticed, you were very smart person, and the only gold player on this ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> (Stephen was gold as well but you brutally murdered him <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico">). More you were Mush, more you enjoyed being him. In the beginning you looked irritated and quiet, later you were more and more talkative, and had real ideas how to spread the conversion. You noticed some things which I missed. Thank you very much for cooperation. Playing with you was a pleasure. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></span></p>

                <p>If I seemed irritated it was probably because of the fever I had. I remember Jin going inactive so I became the commander, but next day he goes active again - when I woke up I was pretty sure I was still in command and came to the bridge to move the ship but couldn't - I was just staring the screen for like a minute trying to figure out what was going on.

                <p><span class="tid_wspoil">As the previous part of history was a mess, I'll try to separate paragraphs, sorry if you're hardly reading the AP thread.</span><br>Raluca got converted on day 5. We were wondering about the next target. We picked Terrence, as the rest crew was hiding under camera and I didn't want to risk Defacer again as I want to convert the crew quietly. I spiked Terrence who was sitting in the Nexus and hoped that Chao would do again when Raluca may convert him and pick Anonymush.</p><p>Raluca got back earlier. She didn't show us the reaction about getting converted, she just asked where Terrence was. She was so quiet, putting short messages, but doing her job. I asked her to wait Chao, so when he spikes Terrence, she would convert him then. And as planned, Chao spiked Terrence and day 5 hasn't ended when we converted second person. Raluca showed him the truth much earlier than I supposed, but I supposed her to do this in the end of the day. Chao had problem with health and a bit with AP, so asked for Phagocyte, but I prevented him from doing this, because we needed spores to convert crew quickly. We agreed on Splashproof for him.</p><p>Converting Chao was a huge move leading to Mush win. When we converted Terrence, the last Technician on this ship, we made sure of human loss. Stephen was dead, and there were 10 people active on the ship. Jin Su was taking the title but did nothing and Chao wasn't the commander on day 5. I was the only morale support, so I had to take some bananas, but Gioele and Chun were sulking in the Lab, sometimes stole bananas and doing random research, but not leaving the Lab, no talking. Eleesha also was this kind of person, but she hasn't stolen any bananas (I think) and was staying dirty in the Lab, taking the title of Comms Officer because Paola was the only grand inactive on this ship. We were still on the oxygen planet, which we had explored. Frieda asked for Hacker Kit, which I had hidden in RBT. I was going to use it, but hunters were shot, and I was saving AP to expand infection.</p><p>I've got on question which bothers me: <strong>Where was the scooter?</strong><br>Once I left Bravo Dorm and searched the front part of ship including central and front turrets and garden. On the way I noticed the Medikit was lying in the Lab, I ate a banana using apron, estabilished comms on the Bridge which had been broken, recalled about the Grenade laying in the Alpha Bay... And I couldn't find the scooter, and I checked almost the whole ship, in the rear part had been checked earlier, except Rear Alpha Turret which Raluca was occupying. The history was my answer for the question which Frieda asked later, where I had gone after leaving Bravo Dorm.</p><p>Terrence logged back 9 hours after conversion and picked Anonymush. I got so pissed that the big plan to convert crew got ruined by this noob. I was connecting some plans, I told Terrence to hide in the Lab, do nothing, pretend AFK, I hope to convert the crew quickly. Crap, how could he do this? Terrence closed our private conversation, Chao asked me to "track" and kill him. I found it as the only possibly solution, so I agreed. In the Mush channel I told Terrence to infect Ian at least, but as he didn't respond, Chao killed him a few minutes later. He claimed that he had found no Mush actions amongst other people and considered Terrence as Alpha Mush. I mentioned that Terrence was the only person who had loaded fuel and got dirty then. Loading fuel required lots of actions which might have been bypassed the torture. <em>Lesson for future: if you find out that somebody picked Anonymush, it's <strong>always</strong> a noob who picked it immediately while first logging in as Mush, and when it happens a few day after Mush selection, the noob is Beta and you should consider one Mush more onboard.</em></p><p>It went smoothly, Chao rescued us. I came up with the plan of converting Ian. Ian had flirted me in the beginning of voyage, just after we woke up, and I did it with him. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Now I could use this opportunity to rape Ian and Terrence would pick Anonymush after converting him on day change. He was standing in the Medlab, Finola could leave the room. But Terrence was dead and now Anonymush must be picked by converted people, so converting Ian when he was off was a bad idea, but now I don't have to rape him. On apparently "Mush-free" ship? I was going to make a spore, but the last spore had already been extracted. It was after Terrence got killed, probably stolen by Chao.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">I checked the ship before this one. The noob Terrence who almost ruined the game was none other than <span class="tid_user tid_user_8256382 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8256382">edward1230</span>, who in the ship before was Eleesha and almost killed me because I invistigated people in suspicious for her way using the Knife under pacifism, although I was leading the research. The reason was no skills which I didn't pick because I saved up Apprentice. People were considering her as griefer. The Mush used the chaos she made and did rampage killing all our Technicians. If she didn't attack me, I wouldn't use all my AP to save myself, but I'd copy Raluca's skill when it wouldn't be too late. After making human loss, she apperantly ate a raw ration at 1 morale to commit suicide. As Terrence in this ship, he claimed it was first time as Mush and blamed us that we didn't tell him to not pick Anonymush. I checked his profile and it was his 9th time as Mush.</span></p>

                <p>The problem was that the most sensible people on this ship (beside Chao) were on human side and stayed in secured Bravo Dorm. My plan was to occupy all Bravo Dorm beds by the Mush so human will be forced to sleep in the Alpha Dorm. But Kuan Ti complained that Chao was dirty in Alpha Dorm without camera and preferred to stand in Bravo Dorm. But Frieda was so naive and believed in Chao.</p><p>When Terrence got killed, many things has changed. Gioele died due to fatal depression, Chao claimed we were Mush free, Kuan Ti was relieved enough to sleep in Alpha Dorm and Ian invited me to tell me how are bananas and proposed me DTT. Frieda was wondering if Terrence didn't convert anyone.</p><p>Day 6 began and Kuan Ti got spiked by Chao and Raluca. A few cycles later I planned to make 2 spores and try to convert Kuan Ti once he's active. I also planned to move this ship away as it was still staying on the same oxygen planet, but Frieda was quicker and shot and punched Jin Su to death. <em>I wish she got injuried with the Blaster. I'd let Chao punch her to storage and keep her as hostage, or at least don't allow her to touch Medlab bed, so rude and so funny.</em> Thank you Frieda, at least I didn't have to waste my time on hacking and moving away. Chao would do this. The aim was to let Frieda continue scanning so she won't investigate us but stay on the Bridge. Frieda got Gastroenteritis and waited for healing in the Medlab. Eleesha got depressed and died, so I became the comms officer. Fortunately the comms were down, so I didn't have to take care of them. Frieda wanted also to kill Paola but didn't notice I'd already become comms manager. I sold Paola for Magnetic Net saying that my morale was important there. I made 2 spores and claimed dirty while advancing PILGRED and washed myself.</p><p>After this, I was almost exhausted and went to sleep in Bravo Dorm when a small accident happened. Raluca got steel plated and room shake appeared in her room, as she lost HP down to 4. Finola couldn't help as she was inactive. Moreover, Frieda punch her because she felt so important to take the bed. I told Raluca to announce it in the public to avoid suspicion why I would know that Frieda needed healing. I got a mission from Chao, Raluca didn't respond, I had to take the risk. I took the Medikit and Bandage from the Medlab, where Frieda was lying, and healed Raluca who stood in Alpha Bay 2, left the Medikit and Bandage for her. Frieda asked about the Medikit, I told that I healed Raluca and she didn't need the Medikit to get healed in the Medlab. She asked how I knew about Raluca being so damaged, I claimed that I shared private conversation with Raluca to relay PILGRED. Raluca was quiet in public chat before conversion and after this she even didn't talk there beside the progress of PILGRED, but Chao was an awesome lawyer and didn't allow to kill. If anybody had a suspect, they'd ask Chao, the man who killed the Mush, because human didn't own the Knife and wouldn't consult with each other to kill somebody without Chao. Frieda wanted to sell inactive Finola. It was rude, she wanted to sell our Mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":sq_bad:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>While trying to convert Kuan Ti, I asked him if he could relay project to spend some free points. <em>I was chatting with third fellow Mush, previous were Finola and Raluca, now Kuan Ti, if not counting Ian who invited me, not I him. It's simply "Invite your target to the chat!"</em> I kept being active every half of hour. Once I logged back, he was active just a few minutes, to alert that he got Agoraphobia and Fungal Infection going to Bravo Dorm. In private conversation where I asked him to relay project, this time I logged back I saw message 3 minutes before and he said "I'm down now." <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"> I went to Alpha Dorm and told Kuan Ti that he couldn't be in the crowd. About Fungic Infection I said the only excuse I could: I threw the fault on dead (Terrence). Waiting till cycle 8, Kuan Ti no respond, Frieda annoyed that Gastroenteritis got self-cured. I also got annoyed that I hadn't infected anybody that day. I went to the Medlab and did it with Ian, went back to Alpha Dorm and spiked Hua. I didn't want to convert Kuan Ti because he was too little active, so I agreed for radical methods. As Kuan Ti was the only human relaying projects, I relayed them and told Chao to trap the Nexus with a spore. I told him also to spike Hua and trap Alpha Bay to convert her. She didn't agree to convert Hua. Chao reminded me that Hua was new and she might've not picked Anonymush right after getting converted. I enjoyed Chao in my team even more and postponed converting Hua for later. Nexus trapped, waiting for Mush.</p><p>In the next day I woke up next to Kuan Ti, still human, but got cured of Agoraphobia. I wanted to wait for more AP, but Chao had already sent me a mission so I could act earlier. I made new spores in the Alpha Bay 2, telling that I got dirty from trying to repair the hull, however I even didn't attempt. I went to shower and clean to the Medlab. I spiked Ian under pacifism and waiting for him doing it. There was a problem. He left the banana in the Medlab in case I was too exhausted to do it. I told I left the banana for later to help with projects (I even didn't say that I'd already eaten and got full stomach) and promised to eat it as soon as I came back. Meanwhile Kuan Ti was active and accessing NERON's Core swallowed the spore and some fun happened.</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> Kuan Ti has finished their journey and is now Mush.</span></span><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">LOL I knew it...</span></span><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Of course you did.

Why you got dirty as you only participated in project ? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"></span></span><br>But in the map I'd seen somebody in the Nexus since Kuan Ti had got trapped. I knew Kuan Ti made a spore. But how could Frieda know that Kuan Ti was dirty when Kuan Ti was the last human who visits Nexus? There are things impossible and Frieda in the Nexus was one of them. What the excuse? Consuming food? Getting flu? I can't say that he repaired the door in Rear Corridor (which stayed broken there) because he stays in the Nexus after relaying projects. Frieda wants Chao to torture Kuan Ti. I went to the Nexus and it explained everything. Yes, Frieda in the Nexus is an impossible thing. There was Chao in the Nexus. So Kuan Ti must've been in the Bravo Dorm where Frieda slept. Let's make an excuse!<br><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">I bet he tried to repair that door. BTW I trust Kuan Ti as well as Frieda, Ian, Chao and Hua. He got cured from Agoraphobia 6 hours ago.</span></span><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">ok, I'm sorry ... paranoid . <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"></span></span><br><em>Ironically she was opposite: naive.</em><br>I had told Chao to claim Frieda that Kuan Ti had tried to repair that door. As I said: he was the best lawyer. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.vg/img/icons/ui/chao.png" alt=":mush_chao_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Frieda: " hhhmmm ... I'm afraid we have a betas ... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"> "<br>" well I can say let's rush pilgred then <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> "</span></span><br>And before we convert the rest, we had to make PILGRED first. I relayed PILGRED for Raluca and what? Dirty? Again? Oh no, I won't wash, we're in "Mush-free" ship, aren't we? I went to sleep in the Alpha Dorm. Kuan Ti was active enough to repair PILGRED with Raluca in the end of day. PILGRED repaired, Raluca shouted "coffee" and NERON turned on coffee. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But both Hua and Roland took off the Patrol Ship and got stuck in. But it was no problem. We had Magnetic Net, so I came up with an idea. Kuan Ti loaded fuel, Chao moved the ship. It was, as I said, to save their AP as they don't have to land. We didn't want to waste any spores, and there was one spore to make. Chao made a spore and with Kuan Ti spiked Roland who was staying under camera whole the voyage. After this Roland came to Alpha Dorm where I was sleeping (sweet, I don't have to move to convert), Hua thought we'd go to planet so she went to Icarus Bay waiting for expedition (thank you Chao, you were right, she was new and might not have picked Anonymush after getting converted).</p><p>And Chao wanted one thing before going to Sol. He wanted to kill Chun because she was annoying XP farmer. He planned to use some free points and with both Blasters try to murder her. I just hoped he wouldn't get injuried. I prepared the Hacker Kit for emergency.</p><p>As soon as cycle 1 appeared, there was Roland in the room, I made a spore while he was sleeping and spiked him not so discretely. Kuan Ti spiked Hua but she needed 3rd spore. Stress was coming, hope that Frieda won't come back very soon. I worked out that Frieda isn't active after day change, but I just hoped Raluca or Finola will act before the next few cycles. Ian hadn't been active since I converted him so I doubted he would come back. I stayed in the Medlab under pacifism, holding the Hacker Kit and Knife for person who would kill Chun.</p><p>Once I came back, we were on Sol with Hua converted and Chun assassinated.</p><p>And this is the story how <span class="tid_user tid_user_7838255 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7838255">Mandy</span> returned to Sol thinking she comes with friends when all these friends were Mush.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Pay attention at some statistics: 26 spores generated, 10 Mush, 0 rebel bases contacted. Personally I used 9 spores to infect in these 7 days as Mush. I was just silver, and my slots were used on Anonymush (obvious) and Defacer which I used just once in the voyage.</span></p>
