                <p>So I wanted to tell about <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/13633">this voyage</a> after like 2 months when I got willingness to write the story. Better late than never, they say. Though I might've forgot a lot, I think I'll mention the most important things.</p><p>Once I woke up as <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Janice</strong> I decided to take chances for Eden and reminded myself <strong>diplomacy</strong> courses without disclaiming <strong>morale support</strong>, of course.</p><p>I don't have much practical experience with forced selection but I knew when it was coming, waking up in the other life 5 minutes before D5C1 ended just to make sure no Mush would be overlooked from my eyes as Eleesha didn't wake up from hibernation. Frequently refreshing when 30 seconds left, stopping at 5 seconds and refreshing when counter hit 0, without a second thought I closed <strong>WELCOME TO THE CAUSE, DEAREST MUSH</strong> window, took a short blink at 2 yellow bodies on the bar while clicking a skill slot with <strong>Anonymush</strong> icon. Good night!</p><p>I woke up a few cycles later realizing no one had proof of existing second Mush. There was nothing more left than <strong>human mimic</strong> classic strategy. They're not gonna test all of us, are they?</p><p>Due to Paola's inactivity, I was the next comms officer so there was my moment to shine. I thoroughly managed my resources to progress in comms showing that yeah, I have eaten, and progressed as well. Realized that except for Paola, my partner Hua was also highly inactive - but it's classic to me that I have to get an inactive partner, I got used to it.</p><p>Once affable pilots cleared skies, Paola moved from the Bridge but I was still comms officer... With Hua only inactive, I saw an offer to sell her for a project. I didn't hesitate to give merchants my partner so research breakthrough will never be done as long as I am alive! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">No RFS, no pheromodem - no hope for humanity, even though they don't know it yet.</span></p><p>After getting Hua sold, Finola put a deep trust into me just 5 cycles after selection because she noticed I got 2 projects and Xyloph responses after a great lunch. The fact that the second one was from trade didn't matter at all, did it? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Everything gone smoothly for a while. Despite Paola being confirmed human, Finola advised to kill her for hogging title because I am the next in queue and more reliable than her. Once I launched expo when Jin Su was at 2 <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> but I was sad that the accident event affected Frieda, not him. I even convinced Chun to kill Chao, who was assumed as confirmed human by Kuan Ti, but Chao was dead already when it was known so no one cared.</p><p>After Chao's death I stopped tormenting humans and we finally finished PILGRED to boost astrophysicists and pilots with coffee. Some people stopped reporting dirtiness but instead of pointing them out, I thought it was a good idea to do the same so I can store more resources in <strong>phagocyte</strong> without coming up with any excuses.</p><p>The most serious issue that could blow my cover was hitting illness zones on expeditions I had to take because I was a diplomat, although carrying the compass in all expeditions ensured I survived those. Medikit on shelf, Jin Su reminds us to prophylactically heal ourselves and teammates. I had to make sure the risk is a low as possible. Therefore I ensured that expeditions were started by me so the reports won't say my name, but "You" instead. I also calculated to finish those expeditions on cycle change and made sure I was active after expedition as well to make further moves.</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> Kuan Ti</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Oxygen, HC, cristalite, <strong>yaaay!</strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">&nbsp;<img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> Janice</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Forest, swamp, insects, <strong>noooo!</strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></span></span></p><p>This feeling when I hit an illness zone that didn't say my name... I cured Frieda from her illness that occurred in another illness zone but it wasn't enough for Finola who healed Jin Su and me alike. I was really afraid Finola could raise suspicions even though there was a slight chance of self-heal... it was before Chao was killed and PILGRED was fixed. As it could be expected, she didn't notice anything suspicious.</p><p>I'm glad pheromodem was never done as logs from one of Mush trap events looked really intimidating from just imagining if humans could read its content.</p><p>They even dared to visit seismic activity planet twice! I didn't want to risk the only non-expendable life in Daedalus that may turn the whole story against the One That Is Meant To Success. They didn't like my refusal. In the second case, somebody pointed out that everybody else was confirmed human so I just brought the whole crew to Sol with me on a whim.</p>

                <p>Er... no, that theory is completely inaccurate. The illness event in swamps never mentions anyone, it always says the same thing : "After an hour of marching in the sludge, you <em>(as in "the expo team", not you personally)</em> lose count of the strange leeches stuck to your calves, which must have pumped a good half litre of blood out by now."</p><p>Illness events in forests or with insects always mention the person who gets ill. It has nothing to do with who launches, just with the type of zone.</p>

                <p>I've just checked Mushpedia. So it was all luck? Good to know if I can hit swamp zones without being explicitly revealed. But is it coincidential that in numerous expeditions I launched, my name was never revealed and names of other participants were shown instead? Or is there an algorithm that the one who launches can't have name put in expo logs?</p>
