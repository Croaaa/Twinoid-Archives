                <p>Hi Guys <strong>Ian</strong> here, I suck at making these, so ill keep it short waiting for the rest of the crew to come by and fill the blanks <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Here is our trip <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6180" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6180</a></p><p>It was a quite weird one, one of those you say from day one "this aint gonna reach Eden" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So long story made short....</p><p>- Inactives -&gt; About half the crew <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>- <em>First mush</em> -&gt; It was spoted early, Poor <strong>Gioele</strong> on his first game became the Mush, and had the bad luck of pulling a Spore in the Refectory where an Idle Eleesha was standing and stayed dirty on BB. Upon finding the Spore log, i placed it in the general chat and he lasted little. Bonus points for trying to read the medic mage book before being killed, luckily i saw him coming and read it first (He read the mush research one <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>- Kuan Ti -&gt; Another weird player, he was bronce and took <strong>The Optimist</strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/mad.png" alt="X[" class="tid_ico"> not only that, but he refused to do Neron, he instead did Astro (did i mention Frieda was active, and that he had no bonus) Aparently he wanted to be Frieda <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico"> Not to mention it was done poorly as he kept scanning even as we had a planet to go. <em>Eventually he died from starvation as he got bored</em></p><p>-Chun -&gt; Bronce too. Went Nurse as she wanted to heal people. Could have worked if she didnt went inactive too. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> whats the point in keeping alive an inactive Nurse Chun?</p><p>-Eleesha -&gt; She was idle until some day she awoke, her only words were. <em>"I HAVE THE VIRUS, LOL"</em> Had to believe her <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico">. Unfortunately she was human... We believe she was new, saw the log from Gioele and thought she had been spored.</p><p>-Terrence -&gt; If i remember correctly he was gold and inactive (we had no tech nor raluca to do Pilgred) Near the end of the game he came back, unfortunately it was too late <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>- <em>Second Mush</em> Well we had some luck here, it was a hidden mush, who played her paper correctly, (i am already saying it was a she <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ) interestingly enough our mush did more neron upgrades than our designer <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> .</p><p>Anyways stephen was pushing around Raluca trying to send him to an storage for trade and he ended staying on the RC. Paola probably without checking her Itrackie Pulled a Spore (i believe thats how it happened as i was far away from it and only later i saw the logs on RC).</p><p>She took the mush sample, did some small damage and hid in CBS until Janice took care of her. On a side note if she woudnt have taken the mush sample we would have used the cure on her as it was halfway done and we enjoyed our chats with her <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>The End</em> -&gt; We were trying to reach to day 10, plus Terrence awakening gave us hope on Pilgred and we were slowly advancing it with the cure on Par. Unfortunately on a cycle change near 20 Hunters arrived <img src="../../../../gfx/square/mad.png" alt="X[" class="tid_ico"> We took some down, i repaired the hull as much as i could, but in two cycles they took us out. (On the last cycle we had 33 Armour points which they ate completely <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>It was a quite weird game, filled with inactives and mistakes everywhere.<br>A small group was formed (Janice, Andie, Frieda, Paola, Chun, Me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">) some funny chats, roleplay, Star Trek Jokes (<img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico">) and friendship grew. Too bad we coudnt keep the ship any longer.</p><p>In the end it was not the best ship, but you can always find some interesting Folks. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>PS: Congratz on Janice for keeping the crew morale by her own.</p>

                <p>'ello, Paola here. It's always the small obvious things that get me caught as a mush.
