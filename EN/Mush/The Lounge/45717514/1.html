                <p>D23C5: The Daedalus <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7215">arrives on Eden</a> with 11 humans (and one slightly nervous cat) aboard. Paola here!</p><p>So why the title? As some players may already know, this ship had all three mods for the EN server on it. Before anyone asks, <strong>it wasn't a planned jump</strong>. I was the fifth to wake up, and Peanutz was already wanting to jump - she ended up as Jin. Impet's ship (which I was also on, but was killed in an early rampage) was just about to end, and then she ended up as our Eleesha.</p><p>Our Mush were Frieda (inactive) and Roland (active, and cured.) Hua was a newbie who stayed out in a patrol ship for too long, and we were forced to abandon her. KT went inactive early on, and I traded him away. We noticed Frieda wasn't starving when she should have been, and I killed her. Then we rushed the serum in secret, and injected Roland with it. We managed to keep the 13 of us alive until D23, when the lag and lack of AP for healing caused the deaths of Chao and Ian in back to back cycles. We tried to heal everyone, we really did, but the ship was just too determined to kill us. I think we suffered from enough shedding plates to build a new ship!</p><p>I got lucky with my planet scanning; it led us to our map pieces. Chao <em>wasn't</em> so lucky on our expos - he got lost twice, in two consecutive expos. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We had eight Jumpkins for most of the trip, plus Heat Lamps. These really helped our chances of survival.</p><p>There are a great many fun stories to be told from this ship, but before that: You were <strong>all</strong> rock stars, and there is one mention in particular I'd like to make: Stephen, you get my "Most Valuable Newbie" award - we were a bit iffy about you at first, but you not only rose to the challenge, you took it on like a pro! This voyage was made much better due to your contributions. A damn fine job for your first ship!</p>

                <p>Eleesha here, as Spaz mentioned. For me, I count this as a planned jump.... Even though I was the only planner I know of. By the time my previous ship was soon to end, there were 10 spots left. They went <em>fast</em>, by the time I was ready to jump about 2 hours later, there were just 3 spots. I wasn't sure it was the right ship, so waited... got confirmation with 2 character choices, refreshed and had just one. So I was actually given 3 chances to get on this ship, woo!</p><p>I started with a burst nose, and got dirty in surgery; for some reason our Chao fixated on me early. Even had a player in medlab confirm I was dirty there, explained I went from occupied lab to occupied medlab (no invisible chances to spore, or else I am on roomlog lying about my movements), stated my actions from game start, told Chao how hurt I was. Agreed to come to dorm where he and shower were, told him I'd wait for my torture before I showered....</p><p>All that trust and cooperation from me....</p><p>and he....</p><p>Punched me, dang <strong>wrestler</strong> Chao, then tortured me <em>three times</em>. Gave this story that was intermixed between 'it was an accident' and 'no matter how much I hurt her, the list of actions only showed 3 actions, so she's hiding something'. I'd believe either... but the two together stank of lie....</p><p>And who, pray tell, even if mush and dirty, walks to a known time of being tortured and does anything mushy? He could have saved that AP and just patted me on the back when I got to the dorm, cause only an idiot would have made a spore knowing they are walking into torture.</p><p>I felt so aggrieved! .... Shows, mmm? It's been 23 days and I'm still.... yeah. And I had to sit there, only 8 health, while our Janice discussed how this was an obvious mush ploy, Chao and I <em>must</em> be in cahoots. They left me at 8 health and the whole ship knowing it! I felt like so much mush or griefer bait, on this.... precious ship. It had Spaz, Peanutz, AND someone from my ship right before, a relative newbie who I'd gotten to Eden with, Komachi. Of all the ships I did NOT want to die during my first few cycles on.... this was it. This was so it.</p><p>8 health, cycle change, and a discussion with a suspicious Finola, about my health and her heals and when I would shower and what she would confirm. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.</p><p>Who the heck have you guys been playing with, that you expect mush to be so calm? Heh. Normal mush, most mush.... they <em>want</em> to be under the radar.</p><p>Like our real mush. The active one. Roland. Mmmm.</p><p>I <em>enjoyed</em> hunting you. Frieda was fun too, but a totally inactive tutorial newbie who doesn't starve when they should isn't.... quite a challenge anymore.</p><p>You were. Between the people who confirmed themselves, and the people whose <em>behavior</em> made me rule them out as mush (amusingly, everyone who tangled with me about their suspicions about <strong>me</strong> being mush ended up making me feel quite sure they were human)... well. We were down to less than half the ship being maybe a mush (to my mind), and no detectable mush action, when on the way to an expo I grabbed a spacesuit.... and pheromodem lit up.</p><p>Someone had been spored, right as I acted. No one else said they were doing stuff.</p><p>BLEEP! I was so sad. See, I was dancing with Spaz and Peanutz. And we talk a lot, about all kinds of stuff, including mushhunting theories. I know I couldn't have pulled off how I acted as a human, but maybe they suspected me.... I love being hunted. I'd already decided; if we caught all the mush, I'd confirm by tabulatrix no-print list; then human test - until then.... I wanted to be a maybe. I wanted it <em>badly</em>.</p><p>And now I got a stupid spore, and nobody would even say 'nope, maybe I got that spore not her'. You know who gets spores? <em>humans</em>. Bleepity bleep bleep bleeping bleep, I was confirmed and I knew it, and the best players around me knew it, the ones I wanted the most to suspect that maybe I wasn't human... Ruined.</p><p>However, with that evidence, there were only 8 people who could have placed that spore there, since the last action that would have triggered the trap. 5 of them were confirmed human.</p><p>Of the three, one was to me confirmed human, 99% sure. Of the remaining two.... well. One was Roland, a pilot, active about once a day. Dangerous if he was a mush (at the time we lacked net) and super useful if he was mush that got cured. The other player.... well. he had acted a bit more suspicious, a bit. But skill choices and playstyle.... he was not as dangerous a mush as Roland potentially was. Oh, and Roland had asked about how we caught Frieda, and praised the mushhunting. From a player mostly not talking, interesting interest and timing.</p><p>So the cure was made and people let me go jab Roland with it. I confirmed his skill loss, went to check Tabulatrix (though pheromodem access timing, scanning results, and the overall ship details meant we really could only have 1 mush), confirmed we were mush free, then debated if people wanted me to human confirm again.</p><p>It was then, about day six, that I started to discuss my dream. To have a ship that lasted to D33. This ship. D33 because it would be the longest non-casting ship on this server.... and because so many people I wanted to play with where here.</p><p>Whelp, I talked about pretty much all the stuff that annoyed me.... I loved every other moment of this ship. Now to play another 39 non-planned jump ships, and earn my next planned ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Wow, this ship...</p><p>Vampire, crooner and commander Jin Su here. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> What can I say ? This truly was an awesome trip. Not just because all three of us mods finally managed to get on a ship together, but because the rest of the crew proved to be amazing too. Getting to Eden on D23 is proof enough of that.</p><p>After the first few days of fun paranoia, and after killing Frieda (that was easy) and curing Roland (who was harder to catch, but was cured after a superb pheromodem and RFS collective rush), the whole crew worked together like clockwork... well, almost like clockwork, we're just humans, after all. But we all did really well with projects, research, hunters, healing, and dealing with other problems. Expos went on smoothly too, despite Chao wandering away on his own several times, and we got the three starmaps fairly easily.</p><p>I guess we all have one big regret, not being able to save Chao and Ian, who would have deserved to go to Eden with us... And the vampire couple also regret not having managed to have an heir for our future Eden Empire, but we will have all the time we need now.</p><p>Huge thanks to everyone, ladies first :</p><p><strong>Raluca</strong>, my beautiful vampire Queen, with whom I spent to many delightful, romantic <a target="_blank" href="http://i213.photobucket.com/albums/cc306/FinouCat/Vampires%205_zpse3dgfxjs.png">moments</a> on the bridge... Fairly new player, but I would never have guessed if you hadn't told us. Also our official fire-eater, and damn efficient at that.</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong>... that was our fourth ship together, our second D20, our second Eden... Always an immense pleasure and honour to play with you, and to have you on my side to lead the ship.</p><p><strong>Paola</strong>, serious and efficient, as reliable as could be expected. I almost wish that one of us had been Mush, or that Eleesha and I hadn't been proven human against our will. It would have been a little more fun to make the paranoia last longer. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Janice</strong>... aaah, Janice... You scared us a little, you know that ? You must have threatened to kill half the crew, thank you for <em>not</em> doing it. You did not threaten to kill anyone for a few days, though, and that had me worried : were you ill or something ? But then you had Neron kill Ian (poor Ian...). Jokes aside, you did a wonderful job saving the crew from morale problems.</p><p><strong>Chun</strong>, I just have one word : WHY ? Why did you write that post-it and left it under Raluca's nose ? Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to convince her that there was nothing between us ? Have you ever seen an angry fire-eating vampire ? Believe me, you don't want to see that.</p><p><strong>Finola</strong>, our quiet, reliable researcher, our faithful healer, who saved our lives relentlessly from steelplates and other injuries.</p><p><strong>Roland</strong>, our ace pilot, awfully efficient with hunters. Unlucky Mush, though, who was left alone to face an experienced mush-hunting team and a very active research crew. I'm glad we managed to cure you, you were a true asset to the ship.</p><p><strong>Terrence</strong>, always eager... sometimes <em>too</em> eager to help and save people, forgetting to read the instructions or failing to notice the <em>tiny</em> little wave of 60 hunters that had just arrived (how on Sol can you fail to notice 60 hunters ?). You were just as valuable as Roland, though. Apart from a slight hiccup yesterday (which was my fault), we never had any problem with hunters.</p><p><strong>Gioele</strong>, our caffeine-deprived caffeine addict. We kept stealing your coffees, but you were still really active and helpful, dealing with plants, repairs, healing... You did a great job, just like everyone else.</p><p><strong>Ian</strong>, Janice's favourite victim in the last week. Not active enough at the beginning, but you did try to make up for it in the last days. It was unfair that a steel plate should have killed you so close to the end.</p><p><strong>Chao</strong>, I'm really sorry for you too. You may have felt a little useless sometimes, always having full AP and never knowing how to use it (that in itself is amazing : I've never seen a crew with overflowing AP like that after D15). But until those last days, you were as active and helpful as everyone else.</p><p>Last but not least, <strong>Stephen</strong>. As Spaz said, you were amazing for a complete beginner. It surely was an awesome ship to start the game, and you made the best of it. Well done on being such a fast, eager learner.</p><br><p><em>Settles down on the beach with a glass of fizzling blood, humming to himself and holding Raluca's hand.</em></p><p>♫♪♫♪♫ Fly me to Eden<br>Let me play among the stars<br>Let me see what spring is like<br>On Mushedon and Sol</p><p>In other words, hold my hand<br>In other words, baby , kiss me</p><p>Fill my heart with song<br>and let me sing forever more<br>You are all I long for<br>All I worship and adore</p><p>In other words, please be truuuuue<br>In other words, I love yooouu</p><p>Fill my heart with song<br>Let me sing forever more<br>You are all I long for<br>All I worship and adore</p><p>In other words, pleeeaase be truuuuue<br>In other words, I love you<br>In other words, I... love... yooouuu. ♪♪♪♫♪</p>

Well, I nearly got Jin Su killed one evening: I was so tired I mistook him for my <em>French</em> Jin Su, whom I was suspicious of, and I asked Chao to torture you, Peanutz; I wanted to ask him to reveal 4-5 actions, but what got written in the private chat (still thanks to my tiredness) was to <em>punch</em> you 4-5 times <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> That would have murdered you, with his Wrestler skill; fortunately, Eleesha (IIRC) stopped him before he could do it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Stephen and Janice got us frightened at the beginning. Stephen kept saying things like "I want to kill people" and something strange about the apron; at the same time, Janice deactivated the Corepeace setting with some strange excuse. I had to run up and down the ship three times in less than 10 cycles to hide the grenade, the hacker kit and the mycoalarms! But they turned out to be great players and Stephen a great learner. Good job!</p><p>I don't even remember what was on that post-it note. When did you read it, Jin Su&nbsp;?</p><p>The ship went very well until D20. From then on, we could see the difficulty rising, and we should have gone to Eden as soon as the first catastrophies of D23 hit us (most of the crew was badly injured, with too many people under 10 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> after cycle change). For some reason I was still not asleep on C2 and that saved my life and maybe that of other people. I only came back on C5 to see two more red people in the crew bar.</p><p>I was actually surprised to see that I rank forth in the ship's Honours list. I thought Chun was quite behind the other characters in terms of glory; even Roland, the 31-cycle mush and lots-of-cycles human, is behind me! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway, it was a pleasure to play with you all, even with the damn lag at the end. How fortunate that I'm on holidays! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

I don't have enough AP to wash, so I'll stay dirty." I would have had an objection to being hit four times by a Wrestler, though. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And Janice, you trusted me way too easily after that.

Especially after a newbie Stephen asked if he could kill people...</p><p>Chun, I don't remember what was on that post-it exactly, maybe you should ask Raluca, but I'm warning you, she's still pretty angry about it. I remember it was dropped Bravo Bay and there was a song written on it.</p><p>About your glory, it's not that surprising. You got 1 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> at each day change, and on a D20+ ship.

                <p>Yeah I would have really enjoyed being a mush on this ship. There were a LOT of moments when it would have been easy to tip people over into killing other people.</p><p>In fact I spent a lot of time and effort trying to keep people from killing other people, at least early in the game. But yeah, sweet humans.... suspicion and fear tearing the cooperation of the ship to shreds.... Oh yeah. I wasn't mush. Whew.</p><br><p>Oh wow! Thanks Terrence! I hadn't thought to check. Briefly our long lived members have top glory rankings for this very young season, hehe.</p>

Wanna share it ? Hmmm ?<br>Do you remember how was Jin Su at the start of the ship ? Yeah, he was a standart commander. <a target="_blank" href="http://puu.sh/h6Oer/96cf51d9f9.png">But I convinced him to sing.</a> And he successfully made it.

He finally confessed he was loving the most beautiful vampire lady. <a target="_blank" href="http://puu.sh/h7De6/85d1612be0.png">Janice got to a pretty bad mood afterward.</a><br> <br>Do you also remember when we went on the last expo for starmap ?
