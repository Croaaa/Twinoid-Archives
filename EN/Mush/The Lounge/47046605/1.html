                <p><strong>First days. Promising activity and 2 dead mushies.</strong></p><p>I woke up early and I was pretty surprised. All of the awake ones were talking, and that wasn't just one and only "Hello-s"! Raluca answered on my "are you a new player"! Even Eleesha and Chun! Oh, what a relief, an active mush-hunting team, that's rare. But I was wrong, this didn't last for a long time.</p><p>Eleesha failed self-surgery, said her good byes and almost gave up, but we managed to heal her. Everything should be good, she lied in the Medlab and waited for Finola to patch her up. Unfortunately, she never woke up. I was really hoping, the she would return, I even asked to wait with trading, but I guess she just gave up on that ship. I was upset. Paola traded her for a fuel on D5.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chao was a typical Chao, torturing people in the BD. He was short-spoken and brutal, manly man of our ship. <br>Right after mush selection, 4lvl Ian told us he forgot to take an apron. I know, that people can do such a stupid mistakes, I did it myself sometimes. But not at the very first time and not right after the mush select. So I wrote Chun about that, told her to keep an eye on him. She wasn't online and I was going to sleep, so I added Chao and asked him to torture our Botanist afetr his visit to the BD. Chao showed himself as the manly man again. He told, he has no AP for that, because Ian is too pacifistic. <br>When I woke up (3 cycles after), both mushies were dead. Stephen and Ian. Have no idea, what happened.</p><p>Chun. Oh, Chun was such a fruit. She left the Lab right after the selection and slept in the dorms. I was talking with her privately, trying to explain about, you know, playing for your team or playing at all. She answered me that how dare I?! She's been working hard on our Projects! Oh, and that was a true. We lost Sprinklers and GPU, thanx to that work. Although I explained her about NERON and what should we work on - naaaah, just finish the wrong ones, confuse Raluca (both projects with the same percentage), sleep in the dorms, never collaborate. Chun died on D5 from injuries, have no idea what happened to her.</p><br><p><strong> Middle of the game</strong></p><p>So, there we were, 12 active and alive kids.</p><p>Neron team finally could finish the right projects, although they weren't so lucky. We had Plasma Shield only as our 4th or 5th project and we lost QS because of it. <br>Also, Neron team was a PILGRED team as well.</p><p>Our Pilots did really good job though, we had 100 armor all the time, even without Plasma. I honestly have no idea what to add there. They were our invisible help. Always there, protecting us. +Terry made us a bunch of Pilot drones and Hua visited almost every planet with me.</p><p>Paola wasn't so lucky with updates firstly, but she gave us Medic and Shooter books + we had Diplomat book at the beginning. Which I consider as a win. Medic for Paola, Shooter for Hua-Pilot and Diplomat for me as an ultimate expo-granny.</p><p>Chao became our Ian, she took care of our plants. And fires. And girls. I believe, he was the only one, who took care of the girls, by the way.</p><p>Researches were going slowly, because Finola was mostly alone. No Ian, no Chun. But she did well, we had our lenses and some other usefull stuff.</p><p>Captain. Oh, Jin was hilarious! He was a bit clumsy, sometimes made mistakes and rushed a bit and he had some problems with English, but he was so passionate! He was constantly saying that we should find Eden and last for the 30 days at least. He LOVED speeches and preferred them over other ways of getting some morale. He really cared about every of his crew members - "oh my god?! 10 morale?! speech! speech for you next cycle!", "oh my god, frieda and steel plate! heal her now!"</p><p>Gioele was drinking his coffee and scanning for Volcanoes and Mankarogs. Seriously, I believe we had only 1 planet without them from Gio. Also, he was always a bit distracted. "Where are we? What's that planet?". I guess, that's all because of coffee.</p><p>I scanned as much as I could and we had 1 expo every day. Can't say if I was lucky or unlucky with that. Almost every of my planets had O2 and Aliens (2 or 3 planets without it). Sometimes a bunch of Aliens. A bunch of Aliens and Shipwreck and Ruins. But Aliens were bad, they stole our Drill in my very first single-person expo and they gave us nothing but 2 Oils and 3 other useless artifacts. I repeat, we had A LOT of Aliens in a lot of expos. Greedy bastards. Anyway, there was no Cristalite. Well, I found one in the middle of the game and it gave me a spore.</p><p>We had no starmap till the Day 17. And no one (!!!) suggested to return to Sol! I'm so proud of that, it was one of the best things about this crew. Not a single whining person! The second thing I liked about you kids, that we all looked after each other. People always reported, if they saw a shake or anything and always tried to help. It was so cute, when you guys brought the Medkit from the dorms to heal me at the Bridge. It was D10 or so and I was just steel plated once, not. From the full HP, not critical. But you healed me anyway. I woke up after that, saw that activity and I felt like I was your grandma.</p><p><strong>Later days</strong></p><p>to be continued...</p>

                <p>Terrence checking in. I've played for nearly two years and took my first crack at Terrence. I'm not sure if Terrence was an awesome character or I just had an awesome crew.... who am I kidding?! You guys rocked and made this ship pretty damn awesome. I think we topped my record which was D20C1.</p><p>I"m just glad that I was able to help out... I wish I could have done a bit more to help everyone out a bit more, but beingnew to Terrence had some interesting challenges to learn and overcome. I just hope you guys think I helped pull my weight around there.</p><p>My hat goes off to the entire crew on a job well done. A true team can really be seen D15+ where everyone coordinates to battle fires, broken O2 tanks, and play paramedics on the ship. I thought you guys did a kick ass job at this.</p><p>Super stoked to see several of you guys on the ranking board. To bad we didn't get a little higher, because this is probably tied for the best ship I've played through... super impresissive for a random ship no-less.!!!</p><p>Best of luck to everyone on their next trip!<br>-CB</p><p>Note: Slightly drunk...

                <p>I'll explain what happened to mushes:<br>Stephen visited bravo dorm for no reason and then went to the nexus to participate. He extracted spores and I guess his plan was to do many actions to hide from the torture but I was active at the moment so I got to him while he was in the nexus, his last words were the progress of the project as I was beating him to death.<br>As for Ian I couldn't be bothered to torture a pacifist so I said openly that I'll kill him for forgetting the apron and that'll be his lesson for the future as soon I get my shooter points back (I wasn't really gonna do it I was hoping he would do something to change my mind). Instead he decided to go on a o2 tank breaking rampage. The problem with this was that he did it in a middle of a cycle so both Kuan and I went to investigate and then proceed to kill Ian (it took 5 of us to bring him down, damn pacifist).</p>

That was a really collaborative experience.<br>Although I agree with Hua's last words, it would be even better if there was a little bit more role play. It's always much funnier that way.</p><p>Also, I'm kinda sad, that we managed to kill our mushies so early. Becaaause ...of Raluca! It was her first game and she didn't have a chance to see a detective side of this game. I'm afraid it was a bit too, hmmm, technical game for her. Nice thing, that she could try different roles though. Plants, healings, even scanning. Really good first time player, so sorry she died just before we came back.</p><p>Special thanx to:<br><strong>Paola</strong>, my Bridge Friend! Gossiping about Cap and Chao, such a girly thing to do, when you're locked in the same room. Oh, wait, I wasn't locked there, I'm the ultimate expo-babushka! Anyways..<br><strong>Jin Su</strong>, the most passionate captain I've ever met.<br><strong>Hua</strong>, peaceful killer-pumpkin! <br><strong>Chao</strong>, silent savior.</p>
