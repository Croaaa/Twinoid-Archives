                <p>Hey team!</p><p>This ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6203" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6203</a></p><p>I was originally Eleesha, and Alpha mush. Near the end of the ship I transferred to Kuan. I offered an AP thread, and the only responder stated they had no interest in it, the only reason humans lost was because they picked the character they did; if they'd picked any other character all the mush would be dead by then and the ship would have a chance.</p><p>I decided to make this AP thread anyway. Maybe some of you from my ship will read it; if not others will. I'll read it at least, as write it. Good enough for me, at a bare minimum <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I'll <em>say</em> the things I want to say, at least. Maybe some of you will too, if you read and answer. I'm going to discuss sportsmanship here, and teamwork, and what it means to play your best, no matter what else is happening. And about what it means to win, and about insults.</p><p>First off, I'm going to say, I didn't report anyone on this ship. To my knowledge, no actual rules were broken, at least not badly enough to be worth reporting. Some personal-attack level profanity, but not so strong, frequent, or purposefully directed at the individual being badmouthed (and directed at me, in a PM that didn't include me at the time... non-personal enough for me to choose to report it). What I have to say here, I'm saying as a player, not a mod. The mod hat doesn't come off, sadly I can't multi-account to be a non-mod any more than anyone else can multi-account for any other reason... And mods get to have opinions too. Using mine here, pretty freely.</p><p>I'm also not <em>only</em> talking about this ship here. I've been noticing a trend recently, not only on my ships but also in AP threads about other ships and some other forum posts. A prideful thing, a 'I'm undefeated' thing. A tendancy to disgregard losses, devalue your opponents, while up-playing wins and how those reflect on you personally. A tendancy to say 'I win because I am good, and I lose because bad luck, the other team sucks'.</p><p>Luck affects both teams. Any player can take leadership, any player can increase other players' morale and hope, any player can take actions to help the ship.</p><p>On this ship, a great many players present made statements throughout the life of the ship about the mush being noobs, about the ship not even needing mush to fail, about how stupid and obvious the mush plans were. <em>Impet grins slyly</em>. I don't agree, that this ship was doomed mush or not - but the fact is... I bring my best to every game I play, and I'd like to ask every one of you to do the same. Humans might have lost without any mush action - that's irrelevant. You had an opponent. The opponent happened to be me, and I was working very actively towards your downfall. I may or may not have succeeded in hastening it or making it even more likely to happen; but the point is, <strong>I tried</strong>, and <strong>I put a huge amount of thought into how to do so</strong>. Also, I'm a live person with feelings and opinions... so is every opponent you face. Respect is a concept in the T&amp;C, it's not explicitly discussed, but most of the personal-level T&amp;C violations are violations of respect of others.</p><p>Sportsmanship, guys. Lets <em>play</em>, and lets bother to respect that the enemy is also playing. You alone, even if you are the single active alpha mush on the ship (as I was) are not the ONLY reason why your team wins, period. You as a human as well, you are not the cause of your ship's win; you at very, very best are a most important player, because of your actions, attitude, knowledge, availability, communication skills, and teamwork</p><p>Amusingly, some of the worst attitude among this ship's set of players made a point to try and value killing the mush at the end of the game, regardless of if the human team lost or not. While still making comments to put those mush down. You only sully yourself when you do such things, really. And if you <em>happen</em> to have been tricked by a mush ploy, well. Lets just say you don't seem very dignified dying to a mush plan that you misinterpreted and defined as stupid and obvious, especially as you willingly participate in a plan yourself that is highly exploitable against you.</p><p><strong><em>Hua</em></strong>, you really shone this ship. You had a great attitude, you played hard, you had good manners, you were reasonable and respectful and very dangerous. Of course I did my <em>very</em> best to trick you, both in general (setting up the confusing situation) and then in being present to exploit any weakness you offered me the chance to exploit if any, and afterwards in interactive discussion and 'mush hunting'. I don't believe I fooled you, but I do think I may have introduced some doubt. The point is, I love how you played and handled the situation. I love that I got a chance to try and trick you, and got a chance to practice some skills on you, both mechanically and socially. Thank you for also playing your best, with a great attitude as well. 18/10 is how I rate your play <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":tid_youpi:" class="tid_ico">.</p>

                <p>So, players of a doomed ship, this is the "best" I could do against you.</p><p>I watched and listened to you all before mush selection, as well as after. After mush selection, I aimed to match 'within the average' of your activity and communication level. I didn't want to help the ship any more than I needed to, but even more than that I wanted to blend in. I picked fertile and roomtrap and only made 3 of the 4 spores possible D2 (ship fill was D2); trapped nexus and took my bed in alpha dorm. No camera there yet, shower still up, I'd known the shower would still be there and silently showered on entry.</p><p>I talked about the lack of camera and didn't spike anyone, I didn't know if I would have to use those spores for phagocyte or what yet; also didn't know then how Stephen, the other alpha, would play (completely inactive, it later turned out). Kuan got that first Nexus spore and Hua took down the alpha shower and someone got the camera up in the dorm. Jin and Derek were possible targets before that camera came, but Derek had hygienist and Jin didn't seem very active or dangerous to me, so I didn't spike either. You didn't get ASG done before D3, but I wasn't able to make spores again until the end of D3, when two fires started naturally. While looking for the fire I retrapped nexus, then trapped alpha bay 2 and engine room, using the fire search as an unstated reason to enter a great many rooms, including the trapped ones and bravo dorm to silently wash again. Hua got the AB2 spore, Jin the Nexus, and for over a day, no word on the engine room spore, then Raluca picked it up.</p><p>O2 was getting low, so when I had AP again I advanced project, retrapped Nexus with my last already-made spore, then ran to bridge (which had no camera or sofa yet, though sofa could have been made at any point by anyone) and did a little bit of astro work. Found O2 and seismic; didn't bother to fully scan the planet and reported the O2 as swamp and got back to bed with some small amount of AP. A little later, Kuan reported completion of the current project.... but wait! There was no report of anyone getting my spore in nexus.... My spore. My spore.... Derek with his hygienist, or maybe Chun (probably Derek) must have silently intercepted it, not reporting progress on the project. Drat. Double drat.</p><p>Paola challenges me, as to why I came to bridge and didn't build the sofa. I challenge her back, that it is late D3 and this is the first time she's said one word about that sofa; that there's no camera on the bridge and now we're low on O2 without any O2 found at all, and if we don't get an O2 planet found soon we're not going to have time to use a sofa much. That everyone should be trying to find O2, because it's getting serious. She backs down a bit, talking about how building the sofa is obvious, every ship she's been on has done it, and we have plenty of air, two days worth, plenty of time there's no emergency. Thing is, I would have said much the same as a human in that exact circumstance, depending on how my planet scan went and all other ship factors at the time.</p><p>D4 got interesting. Hull was down to 40 with about 10 hunters alive outside, O2 down to 12 when a O2 tank broke. I watched and a cycle passed, no one fixed or talked about the broken O2 yet, so down to 10, Hull down to 36. I believe a ship and its group of players tells you how to defeat them, and when. I thought and thought and THOUGHT about how to best make it happen. When I got home from work and could be at the computer for the next several hours, I acted. Good thing I waited, a human randomly gave me even better chances to be confusing than I'd had before. Always watch for the unexpected, and think fast how to use it.</p><p>At about 40 minutes to cycle change, Frieda reported another bad planet, then entered alpha dorm and dropped wrench and scooter. She was dirty. No idea what she was thinking, I was not the only tech aboard (Hua was tech too) and there was no shower in alpha dorm, nor any free beds. Already in bed were myself, Jin, and Kuan, they'd both been in bed for the last 3 cycles, and probably had been low/no AP previous, Jin reporting piloting stuff and Kuan reporting projects work. I gave Frieda a few minutes to talk or do anything else, wondering if she was online or what.</p><p>I also thought really, really hard about the choice to transfer into who, and finish converting who. I decided to work with what was in the room with me, to limit the odds of it being noticed sooner than it had to be, and to try and make it maximally confusing. Frieda's entry into the room was awesome cover too, since I wouldn't be able to take anonymush and none of my possible conversion targets seemed to be online or was expected to be online for a few cycles (Yes, I watched every person on that ship and tracked when people seemed active or not. Don't you? I work for my wins, thank you, I bring my best to the game).</p><p>I thought the odds of Frieda being believed to be mush would be extremely high, especially with her dirty, and having never come to that dorm before. There was no 'good reason' for her to have come there, and with the new mush that would soon show... I couldn't convert her as she didn't already have a spore, but I didn't care about that and would not have picked her if I could have. She was probably going to die for me if I did this right.</p><p>So, Kuan or Jin? I could take either as convert and either as transfer target, I had high skills in both characters. Jin was the slightly stronger player. Jin could give me pilot and shooter; I had lizaro BP (and I love lizaro very much!) but I failed to dismantle the camera, and the ship only had 1 metal scrap at all, lizaro needs 2 and I didn't have a blaster. Ship death through O2 or hull? Well converted or transfer into, Jin-body wouldn't be making any more flights to kill hunters, so that didn't matter. Would I want to fly? Would I need to fly? Probably not. I could cover, I could hide some.... what mattered was too many mush to kill, mush unlikely to die so the humans could not just kill the mush and finish Pilgred and go home before death. Hua and Raluca could have finished Pilgred together very easily... I could take one as a transfer target, but then could not convert anyone, and would be VERY exposed. Bad plan, bad....</p><p>Kuan had the potential to be tech in my hands, and no other useful skills for a mush in my spot. Jin and Kuan were both probably high health, safe morale level.... And Jin was the stronger player, slightly. Plus, he was commander. As mush, maybe he could give me a mission, that would help too. So it was decided. Kuan, for better secrecy and cover, and Jin converted, instead of the other way around.</p>

                <p>With about 30 minutes left to the cycle and Frieda having not moved for 10 minutes, I took defacer and transfer, my final mush skill choices. I defaced the room, made my free fertile spore, spiked Jin to get him to two spores. Used my free tech points to try and dismantle the camera, both attempts failed. Took scooter and wrench with me, lost my communicator on the way to eat and break the O2 tank. Meant to drop wrench and scooter there before breaking it, extract the 3 O2 the body could hold before I transferred, to make it harder for my transfer victim to speak or survive; it's one thing to find the communicator wherever I put it but totally another thing to drop O2.... and free an inventory slot to pick it up... especially with both O2 tanks broken. And too, if it was believed Eleesha-body had O2 on a ship soon to have very, very little O2.... more reason to kill Eleesha-body before she could speak. At the time my body had 7 health left, three showers without splashproof and a roomshake, and no spores wasted to phagocyte this ship.... hadn't been needed. Except..... Despite having made my plan and even WRITTEN IT DOWN I was too adrenalized. I forgot to extract the O2 before breaking the tank. Whoops, well.... at cycle change we should go down to 7 O2 and soon none even without losing 3 more. I burned the rest of my AP and all but one move, had already made sure my body was full so it could not eat soon, and went back to alpha dorm.</p><p>Once back in alpha dorm, defacer still in effect, I dropped scooter and wrench and transferred to Kuan. New body, new use of fertile, new use of defacer, new ability to directly spike. Kuan had 8 AP; I made the body's free spore, spent an AP to spike Jin and finish converting him. 3 mush on the bar now. Duplicated Kuan's single designer skill, and laid back down in the same bed Kuan had been in. A few minutes to cycle change..... I refreshed about every 20 seconds. Nothing happened, nothing happened..... A huge amount of nothing happening.</p><p>Cycle change, hull down to low 30s, new hunters so now we have 14, 7 O2 left. Refresh every 20 seconds. Again. Again. Some activity! Raluca announces advancing the project; no talk of new mush, rapidly dropping O2 and hull, hunter swarm, or of anything looking suspicious, though I now refresh every 5 seconds, watching minimap too of course. Minutes pass, back to every 20 seconds a refresh. Someone else announces advancing mycoalarms.... Derek or Janice I think? I remember being glad of AP being spent on stuff that wasn't vital to ship survival then, or directly about to catch me right then. Still no outcry about the third mush or anything else, as I again spastically refresh.</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Roomlog has restarted, and here the puzzle sits; No roomlog before this cycle, Eleesha skill-less, dirty, and standing; Frieda with skill, dirty and standing; Kuan dirty, with skill, and in bed; Jin clean, with skill, and in bed. Clear evidence that Eleesha and Frieda both entered the room the cycle before; Eleesha clearly had access to an O2 tank, one broken with announcement, one broken without.</span></span></p><p>Then it happens. Hua notices. The O2 first, she checks tanks and fixes. Yes, AP spent... Outcry against Eleesha, did Eleesha even TRY to fix the tank? Paola speaks, third mush spotted on the bar. The hunt is on, and I'm refreshing about once every two seconds. Some talk is public. I pretend to be not there and just watch and listen. Hua in and outs and comes back in; declares she will kill Kuan.... Wow. My trap failed? I got out-thought that fast, that easy, that obviously? I am stunned, and refreshing <strong>as-fast</strong> as the page will load, maybe even faster than once a second. Roomlog or message update? Minimap dots changing? Refresh, barely time to see, refresh, barely time to see. It's D4, early D4, almost no lag in the game yet on this low-conversation ship. Some small conversation about Eleesha and sabotage.</p><p>Hua attacks... Frieda. She attacks Frieda, despite having announced she would kill Kuan! Yes! Was she worried Frieda was online and watching? A reasonable worry, I might take the same precaution, say I would kill A when I mean to kill B to have more time and less fear in my target. Stab, Stab, stab, stab.... some misses. 6 AP spent to kill Frieda..... Human Frieda. Events take a short pause as Hua and Paola react to the death... of a human not a mush. My refreshing doesn't slow. Anything could happen; I refreshed through the stabbing even, it's possible to fumble the knife. If that had happened, it <em>would</em> have been my knife if at all possible. Refresh, glance, refresh glance.</p><p>Hua starts to stab Jin. Oh, drat. Well I can't expect the skill-less body to be killed, sigh. Three tries, two hits. Sure, Jin is many things, decoy, possible partner, one more thing to eat AP in killing, one more distraction in the puzzle. But I really don't <em>want</em> him dead, he's much more useful alive. I picked him to convert, not kill, partially because he kind of looked like the better transfer target of the three present, if you ignore that after transferring, Eleesha maybe did nothing... certainly didn't leave the room. If you're going to not use any skills, skill don't matter.... but who thinks like that? Especially through the adrenaline? I made this plan and about 20 alternates earlier, when I was calm and could think them all through. 3 stabs, and Hua stops. Yes. Low AP. My refreshing doesn't stop.</p><p>Sure enough, Paola enters. Refresh, refresh! Drops a ration. Alright, that's not the knife.... Over a minute passes. Hua drops the knife. I snatch the knife, eat the food, stab stab stab stab Paola to death. Whatever Paola was doing, she never gets an action or message off before she is dead. Barely any pause. breathe! refresh! Refresh! Give time to read! Refresh! Refresh! Stab stab stab Eleesha dead. Ah, still 1 AP left. Back in bed. Breathe! refresh refresh give time to read refresh refresh Post time! Under Paola's death message "Wait, then who are the mush?" Hua has already posted, 'Nice deny, Kuan'. And then the next stage of the plan is well started.</p><p>Sure, I refresh a lot. But Hua has no AP and no one else seems online.... <strong>it's time to talk!</strong></p>

                <p>I explain that I logged in and checked roomlog first. Saw the short roomlog, everything before this cycle gone, saw Hua had walked in and out a few times then stabbed Frieda to death and went for Jin too. I saw we had only dead humans, I thought Hua was rampaging mush and that she stopped because she ran out of AP. I refresh and see Paola entered and Hua has just dropped the knife. Paola has to be Hua's partner, and came to finish the rampage, so I killed Paola because she was the mush with AP. Except when I killed Paola, I saw she was human. So I knew Hua probably was human too, and stopped to read the messages. Saw that Hua and Paola said that Eleesha had sabotaged and defaced so I killed Eleesha, but Eleesha's human too. I was so sorry. That I didn't know how I got dirty, I never saw Frieda enter the room, I don't know how she got dirty either, that maybe there were more mush than the three we could see, maybe whoever defaced the room left the room before defacer ended, I don't know who the mush are. I'm human but I can't prove it now, I ate that food for the AP to stab so now I'm full and I don't know what's going on.</p><p>We talk, and talk. Hua clearly does not <em>believe</em> I am human, but there appears to be enough doubt and not enough AP to do anything about it. Hua even invites me into the mushhunt channel, saying that innocent or not, I deserve to be there. Cycle change. I'm first to refresh, Jin takes damage. Drat, he's bleeding. After converting him I'd made a PM for him, telling him who had spores, who our partner was, what my strategy was, what I wanted from him. (I wanted Hua converted if we lived to day change and more spores. I wanted that very, very much). I updated that to tell him I knew he was bleeding, urged him to talk with me if he got the chance to, that I was still there, lets work together somehow if possible, either way there is doubt, use it, act human if you are willing. Play like yourself.</p><p>Jin connects. We talk a bit, he tells me he is French, that the player I removed from Kuan's body was his friend he had managed to jump into the game with, that it seems really hard to survive on the EN server, that he has critical hemorrhage and a broken finger (not bad! Hua only landed 2 stabs! Lots of injury for that little stabbing!) and only 2 hp left. He goes to medlab, finds the bed open (I think Paola had shared medlab with Chun, Paola in bed and Chun with logistics from her - no time for anyone to have taken the bed yet), does two successful surgeries, gets up to 6 health. Makes 4 posts about it and being dirty from it.</p><p>I fail to get a mission from him, oh well.</p><p>Derek connects. Smart, savvy, scary Derek. His cold gaze surveys the thread and evidence. His verdict: Do I kill Kuan or Jin? Very reasonable choice, Mr Wrestler. I pull four previous posts from the threads from myself pre-transfer, then pull the 4 recent posts Jin made about his surgery needs and how it went. I post them together, and say I see similarities. Here I am, talking more than I have <em>all game</em> with these people with so much evidence against me.... and I managed to not sound like myself early game enough so that Derek and Hua agreed that this non-native English speaker sounded more like 'me' than I did.</p><p>Wow. That is so totally a win-feel for me. It's HARD for me to not sound like me, and I believe I write very distinctively, and have trouble fixing that. They had days of examples of my writing, though I tried to say very little after mush selection, and all that I said after transfer, 100s of words to compare to what I'd said before. And they pick someone who was not me, and who I didn't speak for, offering what to say in a PM or anything.</p><p>Jin dies mush, of course. I warn him in PM that <span class="tid_strike">Derek</span> Death comes, but he's not there at the moment or can not or will not do anything. Oh well. I didn't -want- him dead, but the more effort the humans spend not killing hunters and finding O2 before it is totally too late... Derek says next cycle he can eat, and that he'll be back an hour into the cycle.</p><p>Cycle change! We're still alive. Still 14 hunters. I have commander title. Hull is at 16 or so. No mention of hacker kit found, and I'd been posting about that needed to move the ship before cycle change.... so I feel safe at last to go to sleep.</p><p>After I wake, the ship is dead; Janice had tried to kill me before the final cycle change but I lived to die with the ship.</p><p>So, people. How about sportsmanship? How about respect for your opponents? You have NO IDEA what the mush are doing, until you catch them at it.... and if your opponent is able to, you're going to catch more than mush because of a lot of hard work and rapid opportunism from those opponents. Every win is a lot of luck and teamwork, chances recognized and taken, and risks working out alright for the winner.</p><p>No one <em>always</em> wins. No one is the <em>god of mush</em> as mush or human. You're playing against people and the RNG. How about respecting your opponents, because they actually are a lot like you and deserve it? How about being a good sport about it as you try your best, be it easy or hard? Sportsmanship, good sportsmanship, it makes the game better for everyone. Really. I challenge you, every one of you, play with high sportsmanship and see what happens in these games.</p><p>I continue to jump randomly. I continue to hope to be on everyone's ship, someday. I'm bringing my best when I find you, no matter if I am your ally or opponent, and I will play with you with respect and the greatest skill I can find in me. I challenge you to play back in similar spirit and attitude, and promise that I will accept winning or losing as it comes, while trying constantly to get a real win for my team. Even if the ship I am on 'would lose anyway'. Even if 'my team has no chance'. Even if it's very easy for me or seems impossible, I will study everything happening and give you the very best I have. So be a good sport, it makes the game more fun for everyone, and helps your team build teamwork too.</p><p>Remember, even stuff like</p><p><cite>There was some potential in this ship but the inactivity killed it.<br><br>Eh, ship blew up because of inactive / bloodthirsty pilots with low O2 on the horizon.</cite></p><p>Mmm. Really? What am I, chopped spacedust? I challenge you that even if a ship 'would die anyway', you can still do a LOT to be a very active part of that death, should you be mush. And you faced that, in this very game. You want to give the win to 'your side losing'? Mmm. Not sporting or accurate at all.</p><p><cite>Useless Crew, only lasted 4 days.</cite></p><p>Mmm. really? Come on. Sportsmanship and teamwork. What do -you- bring to the game that helps your team win? I ask not specifically the person I quote.... I'm asking all of you. Every one of you. And myself. I still strive to learn this game better and better, and to become a better teammate and opponent. I'm eager for the lessons I will learn beside you. Please, give those lessons with a great attitude, not a series of slaps and insults. That's unnecessary and demeans both you and your play.</p><p>Thanks again, Hua. You were hugely the highlight of this ship for me.</p><p><cite>Kuan ti is actually a ninja!</cite></p><p>Mmmm. Thank you. You made me work, Hua. You -allowed- me to play my best in some ways that would not have opened up without you. You made the game much more fun for me and were a great and sporting opponent. Wow, and thanks. I can't wait for our next rematch, and the one after that, be us same side or not.</p>

There are quite a few sporting players in the game.

                <p>My wonders were intended to redirect your focus, so I'll try again to do so in a more pointed fashion.</p><p>Be responsible for yourself, first and primarily. Focus on what is in your control, and what you can yourself do to make your experiences more valuable and successful for yourself and your team. Again, this is intended <em>generally</em> not specifically at you only, Pave. However, focus elsewhere is very much not what I am intending at this time.</p><br><p>The reason for this focus is that it is a fix for what you also cared to mention was the "Worse and more saddening thing" to you. Every person who does focus on what they personally can do to make things better, is making things better. Even if that person was already pretty darn pleasant and sporting, or wasn't. Better is better, period. What we personally can make happen is what we actually can make happen. Focus there, first and most.</p>

                <p>Thank you for this thread, Impet! I hope that some more of your crew mates take the time to read this, and for that matter, I hope that some of the crew mates from <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6183">my most recent ship</a> do too. A ship where once a single mush was revealed defacing (and secretly beta mushing me), pretty much the entire crew degenerated into fighting with each other over how everyone was terrible instead of working together to defeat the two remaining and fully outed mushes, which was entirely doable and quite frankly easy if they'd made an effort instead of writing off their crewmates as bad players.</p>

Many Inactives and some silent People like Chun of wich I do not remember a single word. I, Derek, had to do the major part of research. I did not really recognise any great mush stuff except infecting a thrid person wich was completely unnessesary on a ship like this. Of course I triied what I could for the ship but I stopped beliving in it quite early on.</p>
