                <p>Ended the ship at Day 11 cycle 7 , <br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4039" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4039</a><br> <br>Your Captain Jin-Su is here . eventually this is a ruined game because our mush , Eleesha have surrender and tell his mate(terrence) too. everything is good actually in our ship active team , good player , and not much of drama like other ship without any mush around :/.</p><p>From D1-D2 the mush are all dead. D3 - D7, everything went fine , crew always active , defense always there when we needed , food supply controlled , we have 5 pot of banana. Active Research/Neron/Pilgred team and got a quite much research ( But we didnt). Our Ship thought very epic , we rush our Pilgred from D8 or D9 from 1 % to D11 C7 100 % without Raluca , that is hard work. we lost quite 3 guy with active thought they were really helpful until they died from Falling Steel , worst was gioele died from destroying note hahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>Eventhough without mush , we got a pretty much unlucky situation , we got exploration , the most best result was first exploration that filled our oxy to 32 full oxy :3 . and quite much enough supply of everything . Thing start to hit us starting day 6 or day 7 rushing for pilgred as we are nearing day 10 , eventually after few exploration we were still in great shape in day 9 although suffered quite a casulty , we lost derek and stephen ( already lost raluca - inactive and Gioele because of tearing note), cause of Falling Sheet of Steel grrrrrr -.-. if we still have much crew we might able to do expo and survive more days and might even able to go to eden but everything not always expected as plan , we were in a very bad condition (fire everywhere , ruined equipment , oxy tank always need repair so does fuel some of the times) at day 10 and worst at day 11 , just too much fire , falling sheet or any other accident ( GPU not helping , okay maybe a bit) . In The end we ( basically i forced even if anyone agree to do cure)took a safer way and just went to Sol.</p><p>Most annoying of all was Frieda She WAS only active to just being alive , From Day 1 to Day 11 , i feel i wanna kill her but we didn't have much AP , She just come active from day 1 , 4 , 8. Basically just to eat , not helping with anything , just walk here and there never talk , never scan , nope just walk around and only active once just to shot a hunter not even destroy it . i wish she just died replacing any of our died member. She Just that darn lucky , i never seen her getting hit by falling sheet of steel or any . She never get healed at all , But all of our active and got healed member just die that simple while she roam around without dying. She even just log on just annoy us. pfft , i hope you just run out of luck in other ship, you just lucky we are active and you get glory for nothing ... just sitting duck and walk around.</p><p>In Conclusion , Frieda just too darn lucky , but other thank that just active and great crew , i love to play with you all again (with another frieda and none ruined game mush) and good luck in whichever ship you guy taking part right now.</p>
