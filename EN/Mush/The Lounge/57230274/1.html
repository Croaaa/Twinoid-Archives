When I first saw Frieda as last character to chose, I said to myself, I am going to be mush. I didn't played for months like 6 months or something and I forgot everything about the game lol <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Yet I decided to play it once more as a human. I choose her and turned out to be mush.</p><p>My partner was Paola . . . and you can say this combo wasn't really mush friendly lol xD Ship wasn't that active yet it wasn't dead in first days, I choose pilot and astro and started out my game. It was active at first days but I done my mushy stuff fast, got 2 spores and good stuff, moved to front part of ship and "scanned" for planets.</p><p>Now most of planets I reported were true and actual stuff but I used some excuses along the lines like "missed a scan" or "small planet" to hide away my AP shortage. Found an O2 planet with danger of death on it, reported it and watched the team. I planned to have a good amount of convert on this ship yet it soon got inactive :/</p><p>This thing still sucks in this game, ships are quick to go inactive after few days. So with my exams close, pretty close that tomorrow is first one, and Paola and some other reasons we rampaged. We converted two of our techs, killed 4? people and let humans to kill 2 of their kind lol <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Overall it was a fun ship but some stuff really got on my nerve. <strong>Gioele</strong>!! That guy always came to bridge and forgot to move, stealing my APs away and still living till last moment! Expect that, crew was good, found a good team partner which done a great job in rampage, in 8 min we done most converting killing and lied on beds lol xD Ship soon will die of O2 problem as they didn't took my first planet and when they wanted to, it was too late.</p><br><p>So overall, a normal mush win by destroying ship. Thanks to Paola, Andie, Terrence, Kuan, Chun (you done good as a new one <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">). Others done good but weren't that active to remember ccXD sorry &gt;_&lt;</p><p>Anyway, Soroosh is back but not until another 10 days. After exams I would start playing seriously again lol <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Well... This is original Paola here. I didn't expect to live to be assassinated by NERON, but that's much better! Frieda and I tagged along to make sure we hade a solid plan. We could convert Terrence and Kuan Ti. According to the plan I should transfer to Derek, that had full AP and MP, and things would have been worse, but he died at day change. Anyway, it was a great game! Andie, I'm sorry. You played good! Hope we can hop in another ship again.</p>

But aside that, you would still fail if you done mush hunting simply for the fact that : 1. I got way more experience than you (not rubbing it in your face or anything just a fact, I got like more than 14 page of ships where I played both mush and human but you still started out) 2. because there was many humans which played far mushy than me lol XD 3. Your attitude to the others wouldn't make you to fit in the team so.</p><br><p>Aside from that, don't bother with my words that much, you still was part of story, keep playing and in future show me how good you became <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I wasn't that good at first games as well, you can check my records they aren't that good lol xD</p>

Also I'm looking forward to seeing the stats...I bet you I shot down more hunters than you.</p><p>Anyway...Our Mush team struggled...Eleesha was inactive, Chun was brand new. Me and Kuan did our best to hunt but it was a struggle to do that and keep up with Research, Maintenance and piloting. Especially since Ian wasn't doing anything. Honestly I thought he was Mush because of how little he did but how often he was on. Our commander wasted 2 or 3 of the daily missions so my devoted skill was wasted. All problems related to inactive players or players that simply didn't care to play like Eleesha...she said that she only tries at this game if she is Mush...player like that make this game worse.</p><p>All in all a skilled Freida Mush getting paired up with Paola Mush is pretty good luck if you ask me. We should have went to that first planet...Lesson learned.</p>
