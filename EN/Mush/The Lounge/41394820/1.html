Long story short, humans acted mushy, and mushes acted carefully, which led to Humans killing themselves. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> In case you see this but are too lazy to read till the end. Last moments of the ship, photosession with our Capitan. <a href="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1240x1060q90/540/s70X6l.png" target="_blank">http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1240...</a><br> <br><strong>Beginning</strong> Me and Andie get picked up as mush. I have been putting all my exp to unlocking mush skills, so i thought, here it is, finally, third mush on day one! The cameras are at the bridge, dorms, nexus and gladly engine room. Being bronze I pick Infector, make two spores and proceed to the lab to spore Stephen. In the private chat to Andie I shout her to convert Stephen ASAP. Instead, she goes in and spores Janice. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> I occupy the medlab bed and wait for tomorrow. (That bed will be exclusively mine for the rest of the trip, lol). For some reason Raluca decides to stay in the rear turret, even though the camera is in the engine. <br> <br><strong>WTF 1 </strong>Now, on day 2 or 3 I activate gold mode. At the same time Andie goes in Nexus and spikes Kuan Ti that is under a camera. I curse in my mind, but what's done that is done. Andie rushes in space with a scooter. Now by this point I have seen Janice eating atleast twice in a row in the lab, so I decide to start a private chat with her and share the results of my work. Gladly, we had some people browsing bravo dorm with no apparent reason. Kuan sees that he got spored and freaks out, goes to Ralucas turret, wastes all his ap on killing Hunters and finds a grenade. He's at the point where he cant leave the turret. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> When everyone finds out about his inadequate and strange behaviour, and also having in mind that Kuan got spored, Stephen decides in to check out the situation with him. Derek rushes after and they both kill Kuan. Assuming it was Raluca who hid the grenade, Derek kills her too. (Or maybe he thought that Kuan had transferred into her, I don't know. Either way it was not a good move for him. (Later in the game we learn that it was Chun who hid the grenade before mush selection <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">). )</p><ul><li>NERON : Death registered : Kuan Ti, cause : « Assassinated ». ~3d<br><em>Janice : Human? Are you kidding me? ~3d<br>Derek : he was human <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> ~3d<br>Derek : i think he has transfered his mind into Raluca ~3d<br>Janice : Derek.. ~3d<br>Paola : Raluca is dead too. WTF??? Who is the mush?</em></li></ul><p>In private chat with Janice we're getting along pretty well, I am trying my best to look like im doing mush hunting, being worried about things, checking for logs, etc, and carefully trying to convince Janice that Derek must have been the mush. I didn't want too push too much, so I just waited of what will happen. At the same time I see that theres someone still in the Rear turret. Knowing that Derek is now lying in the dorm, I decide to pay Stephen a visit and convert him, taking anonymush. After that, I make a round round the ship and land in my medlab bed again. No one else entered that turret for atleast a day since Stephen was idling there. The main concern on the ship now is to get rid of Andie who is confirmed mush and is hiding in space In a Hunter. (Andie why didnt you take Pasiphae? ) Janice tells me that she deactivated the magnetic net and that they are going to leave Andie behind. Oh well. At the same time Stephen lets me know that he is also in the mush hunting channel with Janice and Chun. Paola asks not to move the ship before cycle 8 or after, untill she decodes the base, but our captain had the worst timing and well, he moved the ship and Paola got really pissed off.<br> <br><strong>WTF 2</strong> It's day 4 and we got only antispore gas finished. Research is almost non existant, despite me relaying couple of times but people work in nexus pretty steadely. Hunters are doing their jobs. All of a sudden, instead of finding some good planets, Frieda attacks Terrence(?), and then apologizes. I am raising a concern about Friedas behaviour, wondering whether it was just a single accidental kick, but Terrence shows us the log - she used her all ap trying to kill him. For some odd reason, Frieda also ends up in Alpha Bay, Signing death sentence for herself.<br> <br> <em>Frieda : Terrence sorry about it ~2d<br>Terrence : Why in the HELL did you attack me you old bag?!!! ~2d<br>Terrence : Frieda just beat the crap out of me in Alpha Dorm. I have no idea why. </em></p><ul><li>NERON : Death registered : Frieda, cause : « Assassinated ». ~2d<br> <br><em> Chun : who? ~2d<br>Eleesha : Me and Janice. ~2d<br>Terrence : She attacked me. I have no idea why. ~2d </em></li></ul><p><strong>FAIL</strong> At this point I had 6 ap and 1 spore on me. I had a thought that maybe I should go to the kitchen and fake eating a ration, but decided in the end that it was going to be enough to finish off Frieda since Janice was going to help me and I also asked Terrence to do so. So I went in AB, and found Janice already there. Seeing a good opportunity I immediately spiked her and proceeded to punch Frieda. When I had 1 ap left I stopped to see Janice hitting her. At some point though, she left the room.... and came back with A FRIGGIN COFFEE AND A RATION. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> Frieda was still alive, I had 1 ap, 0 spores and 0 mp. At this point realising how stupid it was to use that spore on Janice, I closed the game, pulling out hairs. I thought that this might happen, but I still risked it and got fried. If I come back to the Alpha Dorm and Frieda is still alive, Janice will understand everything. If I happened to use that last 1 ap to hit and kill Frieda, I would be stuck in AB till the next cycle, while theres TWO sources of ap lying in the same room. Hoping that Terrence might kill her I log in to the game 30 mins later to check up on things. Everything is quiet, only Janice wrote to me that she brought the food. God damn it. I feel down, but decide to check what skills I have and can still use, since I got 2 free slots left. Maybe there was something that might help me... And there was. Fertile and Phagocyte. Oh god. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/omg.png" alt=":omg:" class="tid_ico"> This was my ticket to escape. I was so happy I resisted my instinct to take Splashproof early on.<br> <br>So I went to Alpha Storage, spored for free, ate the spore, came back to Frieda, ate a raw ration, and had exactly 4 ap. On the first hit, Frieda was dead. I proceeded to RC, spored, phagocyted (should have done it after the shower) and came back to Alpha Dorm to lie next to Janice, stating that I was clean already, demonstratively. Phew.<br> <br>Frieda turned out to be human, so I insisted on that Derek was a mush.</p>

                <p><strong>LATER</strong> Next day I decided to use all my ap for good thing. Since our Astrophysicist was absent, I went to the bridge and wasted 6 ap to do the initial scan. God I so hate when you get 99% and have to waste ap on that again. Anyway, in return, we got a really good planet, with O2 and at the cost of only 2fuel. I idled out regaining ap while others went to the expo. I think they would have some questions of why my health was low... as I also had bad luck with picking up things. Ian was inactive, Derek kindly pushed him into the Storage so we could sell him. Thinking about it now, It was probably the indicator of that derek was human? Since that skill wouldnt work? Or would it?<br>Anyway, after expedition Derek, who got dirty and was injured went and violated my private space ( medbay) and only then to the dorm, for showers. It looked like he was afraid of that shower, could have used the opportunity to spore me and boost his health. At this point if im right I got invited into the main Mush hunting channel, the one Stephen told me about. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Things were getting better and better. Two mushes were in the groupt that was working on the mush hunt. The rest of the crew was busy with hunters and rebel bases and relaying the nexus. (And we still had only ASG in the lab)<br> <br><strong>WTF 3</strong></p><ul><li>NERON : Death registered : Chun, cause : « Starvation ». ~19h<br><em>Janice : Unbelieveable. ~16h<br></em><img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> Fun part? Chun was holding a ration!</li></ul><p>Ian commits suicide a cycle before Paola decodes the morale base. Stephen demonstratively moved the Freezer and was playing idle, regaining lost ap. I, having 7 hp grabbed apron so I didnt have to shower AGAIN, ate a banana just for an alibi in case Janice wanted to bring me some food again and went to the BD (Bloody Dorm) to hit Derek 13 times. (Still had to eat a spore, since I didnt want him to suddenly attack back, guy had to go for good.) Janice was online at the same time and helped with a few hits.</p><ul><li>NERON : Death registered : Derek, cause : « Assassinated ». ~16h<br> <br> <em>Janice : Not mush huh. Well. Sorry, Derek. ~16h<br>Terrence : Why did you think he was mush? ~16h<br>Janice : Unannounced showers, running off to medbay and barging in on eleesha to heal instead of taking a shower first when he had 3 hp, hoarding weapons, overly quick murder of raluca, etc. This ship has not had a lack of non-mush behaving more suspiciously than the mush. ~16h<br>Janice : either way, if you or anyone active is the mush, congratulations, we have certainly defeated ourselves here. ~16h<br>Terrence : I'm still of the opinion that it is the fat man.</em></li></ul><p><strong>The fat man</strong> Im not sure who Terrence had In mind. Probably Jin Su that jumped our ship in the worst time possible. But we had another fat man - Gioele, who was staying in the lab this whole time and never showed up in the dorms. He was relaying lab research at the beginning, but then just faded away. <br> <br><span class="tid_sideNote">Roland decides to take the control in his own hands. </span></p><ul><li>NERON : Death registered : Gioele, cause : « Assassinated ». ~15h<br> <br><em>Roland : ._. nope not mush ~15h<br>Paola : What is whit all this killing, we have at lease 2 mushes on board, maybe even 3 and none of them are the inactives or semi active players. So You all have 50-50% chance to get the mushes and yet You fail miserably. It all stinks to high heaven. ~14h<br>Janice : By all means, step in and help out with the hunt, Paola. Goodness knows I've had and blown my chance. ~14h<br>Terrence : I think we only have the one left. Y'all killed the wrong fat man. </em></li></ul><p>After the kill, Roland came back to the Bloody Dorm... I was going to blitz it on D6C5, removing the cam, sporing/converting Janice, grabbing grenade and Setting it off on the bridge but...<br> <br><span class="tid_sideNote">This time Terrence decided to act before I could reveal my true nature. </span></p><ul><li>NERON : Death registered : Roland, cause : « Assassinated ». ~11h<br> <br><em>Janice : Ah, in the end, it was terrence. ~11h<br>Terrence : Nope. He kept ending up dirty and "forgetting" to wash. I got Gastroenteritis from killing him. I attacked you, because you are my next suspect.<br>Janice : Except I'm not mush, Terrence. Your trip through the hallway would have told you that. It is you, we are too weary to stop you, so you might as well do some mustache twirling.</em></li></ul><p>Janice was vomiting everywhere, and yet Terrence decided to attack her too, leaving her at 2hp. I had plans for Janice, since she had 2 spores on her, so I grabbed the knife and got lucky, It didnt take much to kill him. And again it all looked like Justice.</p><ul><li>NERON : Death registered : Terrence, cause : « Assassinated ». ~9h</li></ul><p><em>Janice : ............ <br>Janice : Oh please, just put me out of my misery whoever the mush is.</em><br><span class="tid_sideNote">Soon, very soon I was going to do it. I was going to maker her one of us.</span></p><br><p>So we had 4 humans and 2 mushes left. With a single flick of a knife I could end it for Janice, but I felt she really deserved to be one of us. I kinda grew to like her in those lenghty chats and mind games. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/surprise.gif" alt=":anim_surprised:" class="tid_ico"> Plus it would even out our forces. So I took the medkit and used my last ap on healing her.<br> <br>Jin Su was pretty inactive, Hua was sleeping in Alpha Dorm. Paola was done with the bases and she was active crew member. So I saw her as the biggest threat. I hoped she would attack Jin... Janice, fulfilling Paolas request of morale went to the Bridge...<br> <br>And then.... <strong>BAM!</strong> <span class="tid_sideNote">Jin su makes a guess.</span></p><ul><li>NERON : Death registered : Paola, cause : « Assassinated ». ~7h<br> <br><em>Jin Su : Guess it wasn't Paola ~7h<br>Janice : At last. Hello, Captain. ~7h </em></li></ul><br><p>I laughed my as off. Really. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> The only thing that would topped it off, would be if Hua would kill Jin afterwards. Instead, she switches Alpha dorm to the Bloody Dorm... And no one is allowed in that dorm except me and Janice. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/calmos.gif" alt=":anim_calmos:" class="tid_ico"> <br>I asked Janice to get away from Jin,, so she could be closer to me and so I could spoer her, was hoping that she'd end up in Medlab, but she came right to the BD holding a techbook, where me and now Hua, that has moved there for no reason, were sleeping. I spored twice and Infected Janice under the camera. Atlast, she wasa mush too. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"> Everything was Justified for her now. <br> <br><strong>END</strong> On the next cycle Stephen came into the dorm, infected Hua and Janice transferred into him.<br> Hua had full ap pool and was holding two rations. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"> Janice transferred and we let Stephen finish off her old body. Now there was only Jin alive from the human team, so we decided to pay him a special visit. Janice, now Hua demoralized him to death. Last thing I did before I turning into a purple monster was printing the tabularix. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/cool.gif" alt=":anim_cool:" class="tid_ico"></p>

The SDF has been taken, the Pax Fungi is spreading, and yet...the fleshy, unwashed masses of unturned humans still oppose the spreading, and threaten to de-infect everything with the power they acquired by eating Chun: shoot Anti-Spores and slap them on Mush to turn them back to humans. Will our shroomy heroes save the day?</p><p>Play as the hero of Mush who replaces Chun: Mario Mario, Italian plumber with an innate attunement to fungi, who is the only confirmed Mush on board and who is needed to research various projects which are vital to suppressing Human activity.</p>
