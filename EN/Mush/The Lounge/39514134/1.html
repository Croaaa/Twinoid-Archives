I was fresh of a double Sol victory and once I saw the crew so active and working well I though "That's it, third strike or even Eden!"; buuuuut my plans got a little changed by Mush selection.</p><p>I was still excited, first time Mush (if I don't count a brief adventure to the shrooms with Finola on an inactive ship), so I quickly tried to contact my partner Hua to pull out a plan, eager to start with <em>Phagocytose</em> and <em>Traitor</em>, as I know Jin Su goes to all expo and Frieda seemed quite active...</p><p>...but no, my partner had removed a camera, spored Stephen and went inactive as soon as the selection started, with no way to contact her. She was quickly disposed off by the crew, who clearly was thinking the other Mush was an inactive, giving me some time to figure out how to go.</p><p>Before camera was put back, I brought Stephen to 2 spores. Sadly after that, said man was 24/7 under cameras, so I tried to spore Raluca, but she draw griefer suspect on her and then went inactive.</p><p>I was desperate, the ship was going bad for me...but thankfully I had my goddess in disguise.</p><p>Oh Eleesha, only you could print the list on Day 2 and grief both that and the scooter; your death was swift and I was so happy to see on the list BOTH my name and Hua. My smile was so broad I wanted to post it!<br>And Frieda, oh you are my star. Getting the fuel wrong for the o2 planet! Yes, I noticed the second time you were mistaken, but come on, I was Mush and the occasion to reset everyone research, waste 6 fuel and blame you was golden!</p><p>Thanks to those, I could have an hope: I pulled out a crazy plan, saying there was a broken camera and we had no Tech, so I sent on private channel to Stephen to come rear corridor for the Wrench...he got that a camera was in Rear corridor, I wonder why, but who cares: 3 spores, and Anonymush! I had an ally....</p><p>...but then things started to go wrong. Andie found an o2 planet, and I was out of ap due to sporing. I couldn't eat to recover them, as I used the spore to mask my huge health deficit, so I tried to dodge Janice's question by going offline, but then I realized with myco done and they expecting me to pull expos and things, I couldn't continue.</p><p>I tried for the desperado move, took the hacker kit with me and tried to sabotage the o2, but i failed FIVE TIMES to do so. So I decided to take a patroller, as my presence in Central Storage was too incriminating....and discovered you cannot carry Hacker on a Patroller. Ah, my inexperience foiled me.</p><p>They left me alone of course...but then I don't know. I tossed a grenade to Paola, but it seems my Beta friend gave the finishing kick to the ship, I assume he managed to do it because before converting him he was confirmed human.</p><p>_______________________________________________________________________</p><p>It was overall...a really great ship. Despite the lack of tech, I think we could have reached at least Sol with my support, as I would have stopped Frieda from screwing up and I would have used my AP for something more than sporing, and we were really this close to make a difference.</p><p>And also, I would probably manage to convert at least Janice with a partner. Girl, you run too much trough the ship, and you guys wanted to put last camera in Icarus! Never heard of trapping NERON? I suggested you that only because I didn't take trapper with me.</p><p>Thank you to all people on this ship, you were great, hope to see you again!</p>
