                <p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/jinsu.png" alt=":mush_jin_su_50:" class="tid_ico"> Hello, there's Jin Su from <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5216">this ship</a>.</p><p>In the beginning, there were some new players: Eleesha, Ian, Kuan Ti and Chun. My first thing was building the Sofa at the Bridge, because there was dismantled shower and scrap collected. I claimed the Sofa until the Mush selection. Some arguing with crew. For joke, I told them "My sofa", of course they shouldn't suspect me before Mush selection. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>OK, Mush selected. It was about 25min after it when I came back. See logs: Gioele came there 20min before and stayed, Stephen came 6min before, accessed Comms Center and 5min before Gioele just installed the camera. It looked suspicious, but when I visited the Bravo Dorm I noticed Stephen didn't visit it, so he couldn't infect me. Gioele visited, but infecting me alone? I waited for developments. Paola just joined, but judging by his intentions and working, I trusted her and flirted. But she didn't reciprocate. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> But when I visited Front Corridor, there stayed Janice, <strong>dirty</strong>. She said she was dirty because of eating, but no projects, no research, but she'd eaten. That was suspicious. But I waited. She didn't visit the Bridge, of course, so she couldn't infect me (and she didn't access Comms Center, hmmm...).</p><p>Andie Pilot? Eleesha and Ian inactive? No biologist, that's sure. But Roland, Hua and I were working on research while scrap collected and hunters gone. We made ASG quickly. Roland created a private channel with me, and went Mush hunting. I told him my suspects about Janice. She started comforting us later, but I was convinced that first things are the most important. I saved a slot, Leader or Pilot. Janice is our the only Shrink, but Pilots never too much.</p><p>We made CS and when I found the cat, we started lenses. I took the cat 2 times and 2 times it scratched me. I was scared if it wasn't infected, but probably wasn't. We also invited Chun altrough she was new, but she must have learnt how to hunt. Paola was also invited. She focused Xyloph and made 2 Mage Books: Pilot and Shrink. The second Shrink? It was the reason why I picked Pilot. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Lying in Bravo Dorm, I noticed Eleesha had died. Gioele pushed her to death, while we wanted to move her. She was in Alpha Bay recently, but he moved her anyway. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"> We didn't invite him to Mush hunt, because <strong>he was mad</strong>. In the Alpha Bay Paola hid <strong>the Hacker Kit</strong> in Eleesha's eyes. Anyway, I let it lie there. But when we reached the first oxygen planet which Gioele scanned, I told Paola to take the Hacker Kit and she did it. I also hid something useless there in case if the Mush decided to use "Search" there, because they may have known Paola had hidden it there. In the Bravo Dorm, I noticed Terrence visited this room and left, without doing anything. That was suspicious. "<em>My suspects are Janice and Terrence</em>" I whispered.</p><p><strong>More murders!</strong> Gioele decided to kill Frieda and Kuan Ti because they went through the Medlab while Paola was lying down. It was humanocide. I wasn't in 100% sure, but I didn't think they were Mush. Stephen got disorter. Gioele told us that he worked out with Terrence, so I expected the reason why he visited Bravo Dorm.</p><p>A little time later, I claimed the Medlab bed because nobody used it. I noticed 1 yellow body in comrade bar - someone used Anynomush. Stephen tried to kill Raluca. 7 hits with blade and <strong>she's still alive</strong>. A few cycles later, I came back, click on public chat, and <strong>WHAAAAT?</strong> "<strong>PILGRED has been repaired by Raluca, just 6 minutes AGO!</strong>" I've got scared. Maybe they're going to transfer into me? I was walking around the ship, went to Bay and took Patrol Ship. ""<em>Haha, you won't get me, and the Hacker Kit is hidden</em>" They finished Raluca, who was Anynomush. They also killed Terrence, the remaining yellow body in comrade bar, after I asked who helped her with PILGRED. I asked them if I could go there for without PA. Terrence would transfer into me, but no PA. They would get human technician. But they didn't want Gioele as commander. He was mad. Cycle later, I may have been calm and go to sleep, without suspicion that someone could transfer into me and get back to Sol. Terrence visited Alpha Bay, but noticed Paola had taken the Hacker Kit and resigned. He didn't attempt to search it there, to find my useless thing, Plastic Scrap.</p><p>I told "<em>Any Beta? I think Raluca has been infected to repair PILGRED. But all technicians infected? It was generous from them. Let's think... They are 5 confirmed human: Paola, Chun, me, Roland and Stephen. Hua helped with research, Andie got diseased after all. Inactives gone, Gioele mad but not Mush. Janice comforts us...</em>" But Janice told us she had problems with disease. And I knew she was <span class="tid_user tid_user_259872 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="259872">YamiFox</span>, because she had told us about her last ship and when I had read forum, I'd known her nickname, it was her 4th ship.</p><p>Everything was alright, 28 units of fuel, full oxygen, oscilloscope to repair the hull, we were going to return to Sol on D10C1 to get gold ticket. But... it was D9C7, when Janice broke into Command Terminal and hit <strong>the red big button</strong>.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">But after my 37 ships, it was first ship with Mush returning to Sol. And with Caffeine Junkie Gioele and PILGRED repaired. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But please, more biologist next time. "<em>You're stalker, Jin Su</em>" Roland said. Also Roland, you made interesting diary. And Janice, I remember that you said by NERON that you liked Pokemon and My Little Pony. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> The next time I'll try not to check nicknames with character, because it leads me to perdition.</span></p><p>And one question. Did Raluca use 1 or 2 skills to repair PILGRED?</p>

                <p>Hahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> it was an awesome ship <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It started. D1C7, 2 mushes. Me and Terrence. It was my first time as a mush, so he was teaching me the basics. MAN, <strong>I TOTALLY FORGOT THAT SPORES MAKE YOU DIRTY, THAT WAS WHY I WAS DIRTY IN CORRIDOR, I WAS GIVING UP, I ALMOST QUIT PLAYING</strong> "...WTF, I'm dirty in the middle of corridor, WHAT FUCKING EXCUSES CAN I USE? Damn, bye Mush, see you in next ship".</p><p>...but then I came back, Paola just said "Move from the corridor, Janice", so I realized <em>"They don't have proof against me yet, I can stay quiet in this ship and they'll forgot me"</em></p><p>Me and Terrence started sporing people, I infected the cat, Paola was at 1, Stephen at 1, Andie at 1, Raluca at 1... "Come on, it never hits the same person!"... we focused on Raluca, Roland said to Raluca to move to Nexus, Terrence infected her once more... "NEXUS is without camera! It's your chance Janice, GO!" And I infected Raluca and got anonymush... "Damn, Jin Su is online, he might have seen it" "Let's hope for the best". Our plan was simple, Raluca and Terrence would repair PILGRED without telling anyone and then me or him would go to the bridge and come back home with the Hacker Kit. We also tried to spore Jin Su, but it was too hard, never got him...</p><p>But when Raluca got Online, she panicked (it was first time as Mush too) and picked anonymush, so "Damn, we'll have to go over this"</p><p>When I came back and Raluca repaired PILGRED and then died, and I was watching you guys killing Terrence, I tried to warn him but he was offline. I was alone. For 2 days I was alone in that ship, no idea of what to do...</p><p>...<strong><em>Andie cuddled the cat!</em></strong> 2 spores! There is hope!</p><p>But she always go away, do something, and came back to dorm, what could I do? Hope to be online at that time, follow her and infect? Stephen is alone at the corridor! another spore on him! Awesome, two semi-active targets, everybody would see another Mush apeearing in the bar. I started speaking with Roland, he trusted me enough to get me in the Mush-hunt channel, and then I read it...<strong>THERE!</strong> HACKER KIT IS THERE! FRONT CORRIDOR! Got a backup plan. I was going to infect Andie/Stephen and if anything was uncovered, I would just grab the HK and go back to Sol.</p><p>D9C7, Andie is online! On refectory! I just have to be in Bravo Bay to wait him come back to Bravo Dorm...but wait...HE WENT OFF TO BLAST HUNTERS, DAMN, I GIVE UP, I CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER, I HAVE TO FINISH THIS. <strong>NOW.</strong></p><p>Then I grabbed the hacker kit and went back to Sol...you'll never get rid of the <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"> <strong><em>Mush</em></strong> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"></p>

Couldn't track your AP too, since I was concentrated on Frieda that time (until Paola gave Bridge logs) and couldn't have another person in Alpha Dorm confirm your comforts. And yeah, I was just surprised to see when you had IT Expert so I just gave up counting. xD</p><p>But at least I learned that Roland isn't fit to do investigation stuff. I kinda had to rely with Paola and Jin Su to look for the Room Logs early days since wasting 2-3AP walking around wasn't really good for a Pilot. In the end, I was like "screw it, let them make mistakes!" and then Pilgred and cue Last Words. I knew someone suddenly activating Anonymush in the middle of the ship would involve an Alpha Mush and a Beta Mush getting confused, but I didn't act on it. I guess it's back to Stephen for me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Also, why so angry, Janice? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>
