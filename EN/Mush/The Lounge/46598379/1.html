                <p>Infinite Void.</p><p>Alpha Mush Paola here and woke up to see in the mush channel to see Janice had been infected to level 2 by Eleesha. However, I misread the names and thought Janice was my partner, so I opened up a pm to see what the plan was after I had been to the bridge to connect (failed) to Sol, extract a spore (or two?) and head back to alpha dorm (shower was still up). Then, about half an hour, I showed my son - he pointed out that it was Eleesha that was the mush, not Janice. OOPS. Right, I had enough ap to deface Bravo Dorm, and convert Janice. She said she had mentioned something Jin Su (who was standing in Bravo Bay, and I said to Janice that I didn't infect him) and Chun, however, Chun hadn't responded to earlier concerns about the placement of cameras (garden, centre corridor). I get back to alpha dorm to see Papa had installed a camera.</p><p>Blame game started, and then revenge killings, done by humans on humans. However, there was a lot of inactivity and inexperience. Humans who killed other humans: Kuan Ti, Gioele, Roland, Stephen. Humans killed by humans: Kuan Ti, Gioele, Roland, Terrence. Also Raluca (didn't leave lab, and humans were there at the time), and Finola (dirty perhaps from witness death illness or something), and an active planet scanning Frieda (although she didn't say much) died from fatal depression</p><p>We had plasma shield in the first choice in the Nexus (along with QS). 16% I think was last relay?</p><p>We had a broken oxygen tank for 2 cycles before Hua went to fix it and then mysteriously vanished with 11 fuel capsules materialising on the bridge - no pilgred trade, only other option was Hua for Hydropot - sorry, I couldn't resist... but did anyone comment on this? There were still some competent humans alive.</p><p>We also convert Jin Su.</p><p>Ideally, I would have liked a pilgred trade and Sol, but that was looking unlikely, so some humans had to die by Mush hands. Ian was the last human alive, he did well.</p><p>I do have an NRJ journal which will be published when the ship formally ends. The 1st connection to Sol still has not been made.

                <p>Janice here, and who would have thought demoralizing humans could be so much fun?
