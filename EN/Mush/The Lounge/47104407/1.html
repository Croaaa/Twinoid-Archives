                <p>Welcome all. I am so sorry that I had to mess with the ship, but as I posted on my first day, when mush, you have to play for your team, even if you really like the human players.</p><p>So here's the story from my side of the screen:</p><p>Normally I play Chun, but I decided to take a break in this ship. To celebrate, I started three months Gold Mode both because i like the game, and to help my casting. (&lt;ShillingForCasting&gt;The Mixed Mush Gang is operational now!</p><p>&lt;/ShillingForCasting&gt;<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>My wife walked by and pointed at Gioele and said 'pick him!' ...so I did.</p><p>Started off very active, posted lots of threads. <strong>Next comes my first lesson: even if you're in a good mood, don't announce that you're gold mode, especially gioele.</strong><br>I took paranoid, solid, and caffeine junky and put up the cameras in the critical places (Bridge and one of the dorms.) Communicated well, helped out an active but new Chun (to spread the Chun love!)</p><p>...and then I was selected as a mush. FML. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy playing as a mush, but all Gioele's skills are now actively working against him as a ticking bomb due to the bug with the solid skill and me making a big deal about saving the coffee for the caffeine junkie.</p><p>So the fuse is lit. I have limited time, but I'm determined to make the best of it for my mushy partner.<br>The ship is still active, so I won't post what our plans were, I'll only post what I did that is now known by the humans (which is a shame, 'cause it's a good story too.)</p><p>The start of my downfall was when a human Roland goes to the bridge and goes inactive. Paola asks yours truly to come throw him out. The game is telling me to BOHICA. Mad spin to explain why I can't go move him. Also they probably noted my <em>lack</em> of drinking coffee. What followed was more awesome mushiness (and some Gioele fail) I'll share after this ship is done.</p><p>Eventually I got detected (pretty sure I know why,) but then it was only a matter of time with my setup.</p><p>Personally, I feel that rampages are so lame and are sometimes the refuge of the uncreative mushling. I tried to play it straight right 'till I made a fatal mistake that unmasked me. Woke up to deadified screen. I take comfort in the fact that I took hard-boiled and ate through 3.5 humans' energy bars to kill me.</p><p>Liked you all, hope you guys have a fun game without your mushy Gioele! Can't wait to share the secret mushy fails and wins after the ship is done!</p>

                <p>Janice here! Personally I think it was pure luck that we found out that you were Mush. The ship was too inactive and we had many other problems we were not able to take care of (like the massive hunter waves we didn't deal with). When I searched for fires at the back of the ship I passed by Icarus Bay which was burning. There I saw that you spiked Eleesha which was displayed because of her observant skill. It was just very bad luck that she took observant instead of tracker, that the skill triggered (25% chance) and that I passed the bay right after you spiked here because of the fire. Otherwise you would have been alive until the end (which did came shortly after) <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I thought that your Mush partner Jin Su was just not very helpful but now it is obvious that he didn't move the ship because he wanted us to die. Since many people wasted their APs on killing you (you had the hard boiled skill, right?) we weren't able to do much against it.</p>

                <p>Yes, because I knew I would be outed, I took hard-boiled to at least become an AP sink while killing me.

                <p>So, where's the story of my short life:</p><p>Before mush selection, I tried to do a little role play, but not much happening there. Actually did a good job preparing the ship for mush selection. Took solid, paranoid, and caffeine junkie as previously reported.<br>Then came mush selection. Logged on to find my mush Jin Su frantically begging me to load fuel to strand the expedition a few cycles back. *[Sigh]* Missed that opportunity.<br><strong>First fail.</strong> Because I hate rampaging early as I feel it is the refuge of the uncreative and unimaginative I took splashproof early to play more stealthy. <br><br>They're requesting I throw Roland off the bridge because he went up there and went inactive. Of course your helpful Gioele will come rough him up a bit and then spore him. Mush fail. First experience experience with the Solid bug. I'm about to be deep fried mushroom.<br><br><em>PANIC ENSUES</em><br><br>Thinking fast, ever on the lookout, I see three bodies in IB and think they're idling there after the expy. I take transfer. I go to the RAS where there is a broken fuel tank. 'Dirty' attempting <span class="tid_strike">spores</span> repairs. I prepare to spike someone then transfer, because as Gioele with my skills, this gives me an out for my ticking timebomb. Sure, they'd know I transferred, but I drained my bars and dropped my walkie and if I moved fast to implicate myself, I might be able to get them to kill my old body. High risk/high reward is how I had to play.<br>'Room is full' OH. SNAP. They're not idling, they're launching a new expy but I couldn't tell because my itrackie is hidden in RBT.<br><br><em>MOAR PANIC ENSUES</em><br><br>They're not launching, two minutes. Five minutes. Ten Minutes. and I didn't remove Roland. I'm hosed....<br><br>Began rapidly thinking of discarding plans. Think about trying to take trapper and at least booby trap some things to help my now solo partner.<br><br>I figure I'm still toast, but at least I can turn into an AP sink. I take hard-boiled. Move to RC and guard in at least the vain hope that I can catch someone in RC and try to xfer right before they kill me.<br><br>Only nobody comes. What the heck...<br><br>OH. MY. GOODNESS. The crew was not watching (or not carrying) their trackers because <em>they launch the expy.</em><br><br>So I go grab my itrackie and (in an ironic twist) begin signalling Jin Su to move the ship, only *he* wasn't there. The irony is killing me.<br><br>I found out that the reason that they stood there so long was not because they of course noticed the dot in the engine room. It was because Janice was trying to come on the expy and they didn't want her to come. Mad wheels spinning in my head...<br><br><em>Inspiration!</em> I was 'guarding' RC to keep Janice from sneaking back into IB, you mushy Janice you. And of course this is why I rushed from the bridge in the overzealous attempt to stop her from sabotaging the expy, because of course who would want to do that? <strong>[Evil Grin]</strong><br><br>Ran back to engine room and unloaded the fuel which has now fallen off the radar (they weren't watching the fuel levels.)<br><br>Since I started guarding before the expy launched and stopped right after, this story worked, because they didn't really match up the timings of events. Good conscientious Gioele!<br><br>Stealth shower and no damage because of splashproof. Crashed on a bed and slept, and felt elated that the combination of crew fail, sheer luck and quick thinking kept mushy Gioele alive for another day.<br><br>As a purely evil bonus (MUHAHAHA), I reported that I was checking on Ralucca, and threw suspicion on her for 0% PILGRED - which was true, but also a valid Ralucca strategy. I didn't mention that second part to the crew of course, because on many randoms the idea is for Ralucca to get PILGRED to 50% and so why wasn't she doing that. Also reported that the camera was still in RBS as a smokescreen.<br><br>This might have contributed to the humans killing Ralucca, and if so, I am very proud of myself, and at the same time feel bad for her because she felt so blindsided and betrayed. I'm so good at being bad but my heart bleeds for my victims...<br><br>... Several cycles later and more AP ...<br><br>The crew is now becoming insistent that I remove Roland, which I can't do, due to the never-to-be-sufficiently-damned solid bug. Also someone is probably going to note that despite my pre-mush selection post in the skill thread requesting that coffee be left for the Gioele Train, I'm not actually drinking any...<br><br>But Lady luck takes the form of Chun. Because good little Gioele has been SO helpful and active and talkative and friendly, Chun now apparently trusts me, and confides in me she's hiding the hacker kit in medlab, and to please put a camera there.<br><br><em>WIN!</em> I'm on the mush hunt team personal best time for infiltrating the mush hunt!<br><br>...<br><br>I'd like to pause in the narrative here to say that I did my mushly duty and played the confidence game to the end, but I felt really bad for misleading our new Chun, especially since my aspiration is to become to Chun what Patryk is to mush. Chun, I'm sorry for how I misused you. I hope we can work together on a future ship.<br><br>...<br><strong><br>Returning to my tale of villainous deeds: </strong><br><br>I tell her to hide it first, because it wouldn't do for her to let the camera see her hide it. Since the mush (told Jin Su) knew where to find it, so it could only lead to more human AP lost down the road if we managed to kill Chun before time and luck ran out on me.<br><br>She tells me she hid it. So I go to RBS to get the camera, because a camera in the medlab is a waste and of course I'm going to help her make all the mistakes she wants. And how could Gioele, <em>humble, trusted servant of the human team</em> be taken to task too badly for faithfully carrying out a secret mission for the Chun?<br><br><strong>(MUHAHAHA HAHA... HA... [cough] I really need to stop doing that evil laugh, it's going to ruin my throat)<br></strong><br>Now comes more good luck for me, disguised as bad. Kuan-Ti has finally noticed that the camera has been idling there in RBS (the really blunt RP demand I dropped as pre-mush Gioele must have sunk in) and has at last come to get it and put it to use. Yay! More opportunities to sling mud in the sweetest and most unassuming of ways. He hasn't posted that he installed it anywhere, so Faithful Gioele is puzzled about why he would do that... Surely Mistress Chun, he had some good in mind, but he picked it up and didn't tell anyone, and didn't install it... surely he can't be... [gasp] mush! We've got to keep this secret. We can't risk tipping that evil mush off! He might rampage!<br><br>'Miss Chun, what do I do? I can't repair the tank, because of course I'm human and it would look so mushy if I lamely got dirty *again* trying to do a job only a tech should have been trying. I don't remember, but I began with two semi lame suggestions reasons for me to be back there. Then, <em>INSPIRATION</em> 'How about we just tell them that you sent me back here on a seeeecret mission and found that it was impossible. Then to make the trip worthwhile, I could go check on PILGRED again to see if that lazy mushy Ralucca finally got around to working on PILGRED. And as a bonus - look someone's idling in IB... That's bad, Miss Chun, I should see who that ne'erdowell is. Miss Chun? Hello?<br><br>She's inactive. So much easier for poor Gioele to just do it because his poor brain couldn't come up with a better idea than to do what <strong>Evil Mastermind</strong> Gioele wants to do all along.<br><br><em>Meek, transparent, helpful</em> Gioele <span class="tid_strike">gleefully</span> regretfully informs the crew that he can't tell them why he's back there, but he went on a seeecret mission for Miss Chun and when it proved impossible, poor ol' Gioele did the best thing he could think of to salvage the situation, and if you just ask Miss Chun, she'll tell you I did it for her!<br><br><strong>MUHA... you know, evil villains really should put more effort into getting more creative individual laughs. </strong><br><br><em>But I digress...</em><br><br>Move to engine room, put that fuel I palmed in so the crew wouldn't ask me to pick up two things and wonder why I had to drop my iTrackie to do it. Plus, people don't really count fuel, and this is bound to cause mischief - the next expy likely won't be before it falls off the logs, Ralucca is obviously not in the engine room, and so high risk/high reward (did that gamble ever pay off, or did anyone even check or notice later after I got exposed?) Plus Janice took observant instead of tracker, so I think I'll be OK. Livin' dangerously.<br><br>Spore. Move into IB. It's Janice. With observant...<br><br>...however, she has been historically a semi-active player, so if I gamble and win, maybe this is the time for Janice to 'notice' the dirty Gioele and the evil things Gioele did and get him killed before the former Janice comes back. It might get seen through, but Gioele is almost done, his luck is due to run out and he'll be unable to explain why he's not throwng that idle Roland off the bridge. 25% chance of her observant skill detecting me...<br><br>Lady luck, <em>don't fail me now!</em> Infect.. <strong>'Janice notices something interesting'</strong><br><br><em>PANIC AGAIN</em><br><br>Okay, I'm pretty sure I've used up all my luck for this lifetime already so far, but I'm cooked if I do nothing - I burned all my AP for the xfer. Maybe she'll be inactive for long enough for the logs scroll down and she won't notice. Phagocite. Eat my spore. move to RC. Spore. Move to BD. Ninja shower and crash.<br><br>Silence for quite a while until bedtime for me.<br><br>Wake up in the morning. Aparently, Janice didn't notice, but it was Lady Luck's turn to be fickle. Fire in IB brings Janice who DOES notice.<br><br>And here ends the exciting tale of fail and win of mush Gioele. I hope you all enjoyed it, and I look forward to playing with you all soon!</p>

                <p>LOL Fail on my part. I was in a panic state and frantically trying to do damage control.

It's rare to see an active Chun, and to then have to mess with your head made me feel so bad... but I had to play with the hand I was dealt, and that meant being mushy. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>
