Very fun, I started off as human, Hua got killed real quick for doing lots of mushy things in a short amount of time, (turned out to be human).</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">I'm done being sorry for killing humans who are too stupid to read forums and act like a mush.</span></p><p>So I focused on finding us planets and research. We had no Finola, Chun, Ian, Freida. Our plants got forgotten and the O2 started to deplete. 2 quick expo's and we replenished. Right before the expo we replenished our O2 I was turned into a mush. Not entirely sure how they got me on the first 2 spikes, but I know the last one was because there was 5 minutes left before cycle change and I quick ran into the medlab to get the ap. I refreshed at cycle change and saw Paola in the room, I tried to quick click on the door to leave and the mush screen popped up.</p><p>Now there were 3 of us; Me, Paola, and Stephen. Stephen outed himself by messing with the O2 tanks. Then the crew started to eliminate people off of Eleesha's list. I thought Paola was safe, she was third on the list. Turns out they moved her up to third.</p><p>Now I'm by myself, but to my enjoyment Raluca has finished the Pilgred and I have full ap and Transfer skill to take. I wait for close to cycle change, waste ap using demoralize on Raluca (she died). Drop my walkie, waste my ap, spike Jin (who is conveniently on the bridge), transfer bodies, and wait for cycle change.</p><p>Cycle change happens, I take one last pot shot at my old skin and send the crew back to Sol with a mush leaving these famous words behind:<br><cite>I hate this place. This zoo. This prison. This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it.<br></cite></p><p>Great crew, sorry I got changed.....props to the mush, first time I've ever been turned.</p>

You literally acted just 2-3min before I wanted to kill you!<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Well Stephen wasn't carefull enough, I saw shortly after cycle change an not announced broken equip and thought to myself: "I just hope it isn't an O2 tank", but it was and the only person who was also in there was our cook Stephen. And Stephen tried to talk himself outta this mess with the excuse: "Stephen is mush he attacked me and I had to eat to heal myself", wich was a bad idea beacuse he told 30min BEFORE that he got dirty eating. And if he had thought about it he would have known that I was sick after the expo...</p><p>So remember my dear Mushies: Think about what lies you told the crew BEFORE you tell another lie! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hey guys, Roland here!</p><p>Well done Comedian <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. I was sure we would have a 3rd mush after so many days of having two active alphas, but wasn't sure who. The others rightly suspected you but we were too slow to act! I saw you drop your walkie-talkie at the end there and should have run off to try and kill you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">. Even though you turned into a horrible mushroom, I will forgive you simply for the fact that we would have died very early on without your legendary planet scanning! You are the oxygen master, finding so many oxygen planets after our expos failed us.</p><p>Terrence you were great to play with too, very astute and nice to talk to <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. It was also refreshing to have an active Jin Su because it feels like I haven't had an active captain in forever! I don't think there was a single argument the whole ship, how rare is that XD?</p><p>Anyway thanks for the fun! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p>

Comedian i saw you in forums and im clearly dissapointed to see that you an idiot who kills for nothing ... <br>Would even say that you were Griefing as you killed 1 of 3 pilots with 0% of proves .<br>Would love to hear what mushy things i did ? Really .. shame on you ..</p><p>In current ship found both mush and they are already dead .

                <p>I would like you to explain how, coming into the medlab, when I clearly wrote something to this effect: <strong>DO NOT COME INTO MEDLAB WHILE I AM SLEEPING, THERE IS NO GOOD REASON TO BE HERE EXCEPT TO SPIKE ME</strong> <em>If you do come into the medlab, you may be suspected as a mush and killed</em>.</p><p>So that was not my only criteria, but it is a clear warning and setup to wait sleeping in a room with no camera for a stupid mush to walk in and despite a warning, come and spike me anyways and claim ignorance. You and Jin Su both did this.</p><p>Only difference was Jin worked on research for the antispore ( he actually reset it for me), which we needed to get up as it was made (and always is) a priority.</p><p>You on the other hand went into the lab and did not do any research, just walked in walked out (Strike 2). During this cycle of wandering you also failed to kill the hunters that had just appeared. Your a pilot and your first instinct was to: wander aimlessly around the ship, disregarding warnings, not do research, and not kill hunters? On top of this you went to Bravo dorm, a place where mush go to quietly clean themselves.</p><p>If you want to be play like Eleesha, then pick her. Don't pick Hua and blatantly disregard your duties. And I'm not saying relaying research falls on your lap, but when you walk into the lab and wonder up to the bridge, for no reason, and choose not to relay a project that we <strong>needed</strong> done (NO FINOLA OR CHUN), don't get mad when you die.</p>

                <p>It's true, there's no route from the dorms that gets to labs faster through medlab (despite it looking like it on the tracker map).

                <p>Well taking the route through medlab is for Terrence easier in some cases. Bravo Bay, Central Corridor/Central Bravo turret, Front Corridor/Medlab and then Lab. If there is someone in Centre Bravo Turret and Medlab it's easier for Terrence to move through there, but I would still warn ppl about moving through there (same thing I do with the Engine room) just in case and so ppl won't complain about me not having a reason to do so etc. etc.</p><p>But Gioele was still a bit too fast.

                <p>Gioele shouldn't even be lying in medlab ;| And he were pretty dumb to pick unsecured room even thought there were free beds in dorms (i think) . Really , how dumb you can be to kill human , and get turned into mush after that ? And you killed me in a bed , did you return to medlab to get more spores ? Such a noob ... Well either way i were checking logs of rooms . Some rooms were checked twice by me and when i died (got killed) i had more that half AP so it weren't gone ... Oh forgot to mention , but i were in space , collected some scrap and brought it to the bridge for sofa . Would have collected more , but door to Refectory were broken at a time and it made me think that someone may have sabotaged it (Eleesha since she were buzzing around em <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> ) .</p><p>I had Gioele and Jin su added in private conversation , they knew that i were hunting mush . I clearly said that they are humans and that my current suspect is Eleesha .... <br>Really i still don't get Gioeles logic .. I said to him and jin su that i am looking for mush and i need to check rooms logs .<br>Btw why did he pick to kill me even thought Jin su passed medlab as well ?</p><p>Comedian <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Such a terrible player <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> hope to newer meet you again since i hunt mush in every ship and ppl like you are way too hard to deal with when i got full hands of documents filled with room logs and Pms while i look for mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico">.</p>

I hate your style of play because you aggressively act like a mush and screw up the mush hunt. You can say you walked through medlab because it was shortest, but if you came from turret to medlab, then why did you go into lab? Why did you not work on research? Why did you avoid shooting hunters? And if your saying you brought scrap to bridge, why did you take the route through the turret on the opposite side of the ship?</p>

                <p>I think both of you guys made mistakes in certain ways but that doesn't make either of you bad players or "noobs". You are also being a bit harsh on each other, everyone messes up sometimes.</p><p>Darjus, while you had the best intentions and I like that you are proactive with the mush hunt, you need to respect the rules/requests of the ship (like no entering medlab) or else be seen as mush and possibly killed. Comedian was really clear that nobody was to enter, and you can't be 'above' these requests just because you are checking room logs. It also makes it harder for the rest of the crew to narrow down mush suspects if humans can't obey rules set out to protect the safety of other crew members. You were really helpful while you were alive though, and set the ship up nicely by placing all of the items where they needed to be and with your piloting duties.</p><p>Having said all that, I do think you acted waaaay too fast with your killing, Comedian. I would have preferred that you made a group PM alerting some people to the suspicious behaviour and then waited for the others to weigh in on the issue. I find the 'shoot first, ask questions later' approach to be detrimental to the ship, but you aren't the first person to accidentally kill a human and you certainly won't be the last. It was a shame to lose a good player but there was no point in crying over spilt milk, we just had to get on with it. Comedian ate 2x in one cycle in order to kill Darjus so was obviously a human who got a bit too trigger happy. Maybe slow down before killing next time or at least include the crew in your reasoning, even if it is only for your own safety. If you hadn't have eaten twice things probably would have gone downhill fast.</p><p>Both of you were pleasant to be around and I think if circumstances were different you could have been a good team. I know you are pissed at each other, but hopefully you can see that each of you have a fair point and things could have been handled better.. Or maybe not! Either way please don't take offense, I screw up all the time and it wasn't meant to sound preachy... Just my opinion on how the situation could be improved for next time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">.</p>

                <p>I'm not mad, it's only a game. I try to explain my reasoning but that's not good enough sometimes. Did I react quickly.....yup. Do I always do that....no. Thought this was a clear case and we had a ship with inactive Chun, Finola, Freida, Ian, Chao. I react faster when I get put in inactive ships. Not for nothing this ships communication for the active was really low too. Stephen stated he was going to be MIA, Paola didn't say much the first day, Jin was pretty quiet on the main forums, and Janice was mostly missing. Same could be said for Eleesha too.</p><p>When 2-3 cycles pass and you have 5-8 new messages you know your in for a painful ship.</p>
