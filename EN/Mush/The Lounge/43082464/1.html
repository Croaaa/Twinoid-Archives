                <p><em>I found I didn't catch MMM ship on time, but fortunalely I was wrong, but unfortunalely for them.</em><br>Ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6239" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6239</a></p><p>Hi, how are you, gullible folks? <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Alpha Mush</strong> here. My journey has begun when I got into CryoModule and converted <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Kuan Ti</strong>, and I finished as <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/terrence.png" alt=":mush_terrence_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Terrence</strong>. Now, both bodies are dead, as well as all this humanity, but let's start from the beginning.</p><p><strong>First days with Jin Su</strong><br>In the body of Kuan Ti, I became a Technician. Shower has already been dismantled. The Mush has already converted Jin Su, so we've got a commander, so missions for me everyday, but Andie is devoted into it, but just in theory. <em>All missions to me!</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"><br>People shared different skills. Roland, Andie and Raluca admitted to be gold 3lvl, Janice and Stephen were inactive, Chun and Eleesha quiet and semi-active. Just Janice, Stephen, Gioele, Derek and Ian were bronzes. <em>(and Jin Su and Kuan Ti pretended to be them)</em> Raluca admitted to have max level as Mush, so Massive Mushification lies in her genome.<br>I'm staying inactive until Jin Su appear with his plan and... he appeared. He's left Bravo Dorm. While refreshing page, I noticed the amount of fuel is increasing. <em>What? He wants to commit suicide? What is he doing? Burn all fuel? In the middle of cycle change? He really wants to finish this game.</em> When I asked him for it, he said that he wanted to make an excuse of getting dirty. He reseted PILGRED, trapped it, got hurt by "picking the soap up" [he said] and moved us to planet where Frieda wanted to. It was a planet rich in hydrocarbon, Frieda convinced crew to make a fast expo, so Jin Su without telling anything DIY in loading, PILGRED, showering and moving, and we were on this planet. I admitted to be 6lvl silver Mush, and Jin Su, who had pilot skill, told me he had 13lvl as silver. <em>No infector yet, wrrrr..</em><br>I do my own work, first comms, then projects. I saw free bed in Bravo Dorm, but Frieda announced that she claimed this free bed, so I went to Alpha Dorm. I checked inventory - what a mess! - Scooter, Grenade, Hacker Kit...<br>While expedition - I claimed a bed and Raluca guarded Front Corridor to prevent people from accessing Command Terminal with the Hacker Kit or as commander. Terrence woke up and when he wanted to estabilish comms, complained and went back to dorm. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> I admitted to find the Hacker Kit. I took it and promised to secure it. Andie took Grenade and went on expedition.<br>After expedition - Raluca loaded fuel and got spored. <em>Hope for gold high-level Mush!</em> I hid the Hacker Kit in Rear Corridor. I noticed Eleesha was observant, so I told Chun and Eleesha about its location. <em>They probably were quiet so AFK and I could trick them very easily.</em> In the day of our arrival I wanted a mission from Jin Su because I noticed Raluca was in Engine Room and I could sting her, but Jin Su wasn't active and Raluca after a few hours returned to the turret. Jin Su didn't give me this mission, I've got a bit paranoid. <em>Sorry Jin Su for all these reprimands.</em><br><em>Maybe I and Jin Su could infect Raluca just coming there.</em> In the next day I found out that we couldn't convert Raluca quietly because Eleesha was active and visited Alpha Bay 2. She did nothing, so she might have walked around the ship in order to find some glues. We needed to remove her.<br>I made some spores after I repaired a broken door in Engine Room and relayed PILGRED twice. I made 2 spores and took a mission from Jin Su. I updated my genome and became Splashproof. I washed myself.<br>I noticed Eleesha took the Hacker Kit. Chun told in private that she got it from Eleesha, Eleesha confirmed. <em>It was the only thing Eleesha said in whole this game, and it was in private. In public she said nothing, folks may confirm.</em> I recommended Chun to take the Medikit and the Knife as well. I saw the armor in Bravo Dorm, so I promised Chun to give it her. Later, I brought the armor to the Lab where Chun was. I used the Scooter and I tried to convert my AP into MP to have 4 MP left for the next day. When I was in the Lab, I found Schr√∂dinger. I had 2 spores, one of them saved for Raluca. I used the second one to hug the cat with this. <em>There was no active morale support, they'll depress soon and be forced to hug the cat taking my spores.</em> I came to the Bridge to use the radio and see if any interesting items left in storages. There was nothing interesting. I found Mush Genome Disk. It was useless without dead Mush, so I brought it to the Lab to look more trustworthy. I noticed many women on the Bridge and Derek flirted with Paola, Andie, Eleesha, but not Frieda. I found out that just Frieda of these women has visited Bravo Dorm, so I admired Derek and I counted him as a smart person. I was careful at him.<br>I wanted Jin Su to put a trap in Engine Room again to spore Raluca. He was wondering if Derek would go to the Engine Room and consume the spore first. We should've taken a risk, for Raluca. <em>And the Mush!</em><br>I worked out that Raluca relayed PILGRED every 2 days to consume her PILGRED points, but she relayed too late because Eleesha consumed it. Crew suspected Eleesha because she was standing in Centre Alpha Turret. I noticed Derek was checking her. Crew was complaining that she took the Grenade that Andie had hidden, and my Hacker Kit as well. She visited Bravo Dorm later, dropping the Duct Tape. She read Sprinter Mage Book without conservation. I thought I couldn't convert her, but remove her. I made a move. I asked Derek if he had been in Centre Alpha Turret and if she was dirty then. I couldn't remember the answer, but Derek suspected her so much. I thought it was working. Suddenly, Derek asked me about asking her for printing the LIST. I could say "yes" or "no". Derek was a bit confused. I said that I was scared of her and I ordered Derek to ask her for the LIST.<br>I had next mission from Jin Su, but I wanted to save it for later. He was lack of spores and asked me if he could pick Splashproof skill because he was too damaged. I said that it'd be better if he saved this slot for Anynomush. My plan was to convert crew because nobody took care of research. On day 4 they made ASG, but it was harmless for us, we didn't have any reason to extract more than 2 spores per day, so silly biologists. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In the next day, Jin Su was killed. I regret that I convinced him to save the slot for Anynomush. It was unwise, but what happened I'll tell you later. Maybe you should share your experience on this ship?</p>

                <p><em>And Jin Su wanted to pick Splashproof because of low HP, but I wanted him to save slot for Anynomush.</em> We were too much focused on Raluca. I had visited the Lab and infected the cat, but Andie was there as well. The room without camera, Gioele wasn't paranoid. If I could convert Andie once, and when Andie stayed in Icarus Bay in the next day, we could convert her and go to expo we 3. It'd be a way to heal Jin Su after expo. Our expo was private and just Mush would know it. But we didn't convert Andie because he/she was a suspect anyway, the research was going so slowly. <em>Yeah, bad excuse.</em><br>In that day Eleesha died. She attracted too much suspicion. She was on the Bridge when camera had been broken, it provoked Frieda to do so. <em>It wasn't Green Jelly, but it was supposed.</em> Convert Raluca, right? It'd be even possible, but Jin Su also died. When he was dead Mush, they thought it was Eleesha transferring, but Derek didn't forget about this "soap accident". Who would suspect Jin Su who was moving this ship if needed? Human might have noticed that he was only moving, but had never worked with his Pilot skill. I was disappointed that he didn't give me the next mission in the day he died. He seemed to be active then. I'd already got a mission, but the second one would be also appreciated.<br><em>What would I do alone? There's too many people, I can't win. How? I wanted to help this ship and infect the crew, but it couldn't work then. I'm lost with Splashproof skill.</em><br>What had changed? Bad - my the only partner died, I'm alone. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"> Good - 1 human dead, the most threatening. Bad - CS is done, spores are made much more difficult. Good - the armor is low, maybe we should destroy Daedalus? Bad - Plasma Shield is done and active, it's reaching 100. Good - whole the rear ship is empty. Someone is in Nexus. Raluca? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>The Mush alone</strong><br>I was in Nexus for projects. Raluca was there. <em>Is it a joke? Why is she there? Have they made MycoAlarms? No. Camera? I can't see it.</em> I tried stinging her... done! She even didn't feel it. But I sent her to the turret because I didn't want her in known place while converting, it could attract some suspicion, but in quiet place...<br>I was fast on projects, so nobody could suspect me. I checked the Lab how MycoAlarms and Mushovore Bacteria are. Someone worked on MB, but it was to do very fast, much more than MA. I put my advances in MA in hope they put the priority into it. I could infect Raluca under MA, she would deface it or something else, but with MB it'd require 2 spores to infect her and it seemed impossible for me to visit her on day change without attracting any suspicion. Unfortunalely, our cat didn't infect anyone although Gioele and Hua had hugged it. I was expecting this crew low on morale, but Paola decoded one of the next Rebel Bases. It had appeared a cycle too late. If only the signal appeared one cycle earlier when Frieda was moving this ship for no reason because there were no hunters and no planet to visit when she hacked into system and advanced it.<br>So I couldn't depress the crew. Commander Gioele was semi-active. The next was Frieda. Stephen was inactive, but Derek killed Stephen because he thought Stephen would become the commander as inactive. <em>Poor Stephen, funny Derek!</em> He was going to kill Gioele as well, but he got active and moved the ship if needed and hid behind Ian. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"><br>Human was getting ill, and more and more "confirmed" was becoming. Crew suspected inactive Janice of being Mush. <em>She's my shield and protects me from suspicion, but temporarily.</em><br>In the next day I noticed that MB had been done. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":sq_confused:" class="tid_ico"> <em>NOOOO!!! I can't get Raluca now... but wait...</em> Raluca was in Engine Room. She's staying there. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"> I'm going to make a spore, pretending to get dirty from PILGRED. <em>I hope they won't suspect me...</em> Raluca stung, and 3rd spore. I got damaged from PILGRED, really. I was afraid that they would suspect me. I visited Bravo Dorm, washed myself, admitting to get injuried. I noticed some alien fruit from expo there. Both of them didn't refill any HP. I pretended to use one of them and told that it didn't heal me. I got a reprimand from Andie that I ate a fruit which cured Gastroenterisis and it would be better if I had this, but I didn't. <em>Oh well... what a day.</em><br>Janice was staying in Refectory all the time, until day 7, when she starved to death. Crew was surprised that she wasn't Mush. I found myself in danger. People were going expo, it always had insects, swamps, etc. Someone always got ill after it. Andie, Derek, Roland, Frieda, Hua - they were in "confirmed" list. And my cat hadn't infected anyone. However, it did. In that day, the cat was a bit more angry and scratched Gioele infecting him, but it was all.<br>Raluca was in Nexus, but I warned her and she got back to turret. She told me that she thought the Mush was inactive whole the time but then she realized that she might have been wrong. She went to the turret. I didn't want to infect her... yet! I had a slot, but I didn't want to pick Anynomush. I was going to attack crew tonight. This night will change everything. I'll do all my best to create a chaos in this ship.</p><p>But what happened? You know? There are still things unexplained. Even human didn't know what had happened really. I'll tell you, but later. It was a long story and I have to go to rest.</p>

                <p><em>They got Constipaspore Serum and Mushovore Bacteria. It's too much. Too much to convert everyone... no, I should attack, tonight.</em></p><p>This ship was good on oxygen and fuel. They held morale at high. 3 cameras, no MycoAlarms, but anyone converted? I was here alone, but they should recall that the Mush is still here. It was day 7, I don't want them to reach enough days to get gold ticket. Pheromodem wasn't touched, as well as Retro-Fungal Serum. Let's make sure they won't do at least RFS. Raluca admitted to get hungry and ate something, returned to Rear Alpha Turret. <em>It's safe place... to convert her! Nobody will know.</em></p><p><strong>The Attack</strong><br>Day 7 cycle 8. Nobody expected what would happen there. I wanted to convert Raluca and show crew that there's one Mush more and make them panic.<br>At first, I praised Derek for good co-operation and keeping calm amongst crew as well as that all he did for them. I told him that I had to sacrifice. I expected him to be on cycle 1 and I made sure he would understand why I'd accuse him later.<br>I wrote an information about all (infection, transfer) in private for Raluca, not inviting her yet. I extracted 2 spores and convert her, then I invited her and close the tab.<br>I had to do this quickly. I went to Bravo Dorm, removed camera and took Scooter. There were Derek, Andie and Terrence lying down. I came to the Lab where Ian and Gioele were (and Chun maybe). I dropped the Scooter and took Mush Genome Disk. I went to Medlab and to sleep for 5 minutes.<br>Day 8 cycle 1. I came to Bravo Dorm. There was the Wrench. I couldn't pick it up. I had full inventory. I couldn't drop iTrakie because I had a conservation with Derek if I wanted to accuse him later and he came back. To install the camera back, I had to use a technician point and I didn't want this camera there. So I dropped Mush Genome Disk, pick the Wrench up and dismantled the Disk. I took the Duct Tape, which Eleesha had dropped in first days and it'd been lying there whole the time. I came back to Laboratory. I had no AP. Yeah, <strong><em>I had no AP</em></strong>... but wait... I had a mission from Jin Su. I accepted it and some AP came here. I gagged Gioele and waited a little.<br>Then Andie asked what Kuan Ti did with scooter, camera and things I had dismantled. I pretended to be a madman and yelled that <strong><em>Kuan Ti is Mush</em></strong> and accused Derek as his partner because of this conservation. Andie came to Laboratory but I wasn't transfered! I had to go away. I came to Bravo Dorm yelling them that I had been Gioele and where were they both. I infected Terrence, but almost forgot to close the conservation with Derek when I dropped iTrakie. Fortunalely, Derek was in the same room, so I couldn't close the tab. It'd be bad if he saw that I dropped iTrakie. I hoped that Terrence had a free slot because I had to pick Robotics Expert, the BP would appear in his inventory. If he knocked over the BP, the crew would notice it and I'd fail. Fortunalely, after transferring into him, I picked Technician, then Robotics Expert without any trouble. I expected him to come back in cycle 3, but they'd kill Kuan Ti before cycle 3, right? I informed Raluca about my new appearance.<br>And now, fun let's start, one Mush more, so more chance for them to kill the Mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"><br>Andie comes back to Bravo Dorm and tries to find the reason why Kuan Ti had got dirty. They knew there was transfer, Kuan Ti had no skills. Hua and Paola came there. Hua hit Kuan Ti, but couldn't finish him. Paola punches and kills him. I'm safe now. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Funny that <strong><em>Hua got Coprolalia</em></strong>. Why? Because after she admitted to get it, in planet thread <strong><em>she insulted Frieda and Frieda couldn't stand it and used the Knife to kill Hua.</em></strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> Then she starts to attack Derek, but couldn't finish him. It'd be interesting if Derek came back and did it first with Frieda, but he didn't come. In the next cycle, Frieda finished with Derek.<br>2 cycles later. Raluca was surprised that she'd got converted. Frieda gave the Knife to Chun who was semi-active and quiet all the time. Andie got scared and flew away. For Paola, someone in Bravo Dorm or Gioele is Mush. I was the only person in Bravo Dorm, beside Andie. Camera was there.<br>Raluca gave me 3 options: she would dismantle the second shower and use Massive Mushification for more chaos. We could dismantle both extinguishers and steal the BP, then she'd put the fire. Or her favorite: to convert everybody. I also saw to repair PILGRED as an option. But crew was on the killing spree. Also Raluca saw Chun in her room so Chun knew Raluca got converted by Kuan Ti. I wanted to finish with this ship immediately, so I decided to put the fire, because finishing PILGRED was too boring, but Pyromaniac is rare. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"> We've found these extinguishers. I wanted her to put the fire in Engine Room and the Bridge, then crew wouldn't move this ship if Command Terminal, Combustion Chamber and Emergency Reactor. Unfortunalely, Raluca got back too late. While finding the extinguisher I got scared it wasn't in Rear Corridor, as it was supposed to be there. Roland took it! <em>Awwww...</em> But he dropped it in Alpha Bay, so I took this. I came through Alpha Dorm and noticed that Chun tried to cut Paola. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> We finished dismantling both extinguishers (one per each of us), but Raluca couldn't put the fire before cycle change, so the equipment didn't get broken. Moreover, she put the fire just in Engine Room because she'd got exhausted by dismantling that extinguisher. I was invalid, anyway I changed some setting in BIOS Terminal, blocked projects, stole the Extinguisher BP from the Bridge and flew away. I played on time so I told crew that I'd extinguish the fire which NERON announced. Chun probably got Panic Attack and commited suicide.<br>I thought the crew just gave up, nobody active. Suddenly, Gioele got spored by the cat. <em>No glory for me, it went to Kuan Ti.</em> He had 2 spores. I didn't see the possibility to infect him because I was too exhausted and he hid behind Ian.<br>In the next day, Gioele tried to move this ship but Arack blocked it. I saw Andie shooting it. I thought the fuel had been loaded and he could move this ship. I didn't remember if I had disabled Magnetic Net. I landed, disabled it, told that Arack gone and lied in the bed in Bravo Dorm. They didn't even know the fire was put and extinguishers dismantled. I hid the BP in Rear Corridor where fire was. They noticed lack of extinguishers, I felt in danger and Gioele informed that he couldn't move, so I got back to Patrol Ship, damaging Daedalus, the ship and myself a bit. I could infect Gioele, but Frieda noticed Raluca had stolen one of extinguishers and tried to kill her, but without Knife fortunalely. Raluca used spores to eat, so I couldn't convert Gioele. She put the fire in front of Ian, Paola noticed, crew thought Raluca was Alpha Mush, Daedalus got destroyed. We tried to repair the hull, to see how crew dies, burnt in fire, but armor was faster.</p>
