                <p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6625" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6625</a><br>This is an MS non-casting jump i.e. we jumped normally and coordinated selections.</p><p>Long story short, everyone except four died by D3 and the four of us kept the ship running long enough to finish PILGRED, RFS, comms, ~5 projects. Running the ship by ourselves was a really new experience <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>About ~8 of the crew were really stellar players and the rest were n00bs idling in weird places, optionally while being mute. Also Captain 'MURICA x2. We also enjoyed shouting "For Aerial!" at <a target="_blank" href="http://s11.postimg.org/cuwdvq8xf/Untitled_1.jpg">really inappropriate times</a>. Just because</p><br><p>First day of the game (D2), 'MURICA-Stephen cooked all the food and 'MURICA-Chun killed two guys. No big deal, Janice turned food destruct off and the two he killed happened to be mute-Paola and Hua-idles-at-bridge. The crew was really more amused by the entire matter than anything else ( See "shouting 'For Aerial!' at really inappropriate times" ).</p><p>We murdered 'MURICA-Chun quick, gaining us some human confirms via mental illness; rushed research and had an Andie skill debate ending in some sent gold days.</p><br><p>By D3, the hunt wasn't going to well. There were legions of semi-mute n00bs running around BD like there was a "free beer!" sign posted outside. Semi-mute-Kuan Ti has been holding the medkit since pre-selection so we couldn't even check for melt.</p><p>But just before we were about to knife him, Terrence had a breakthrough : Jin Su reported shooting hunters with only shooter points because he was out of AP <em>directly after</em> the 'MURICA-Chun rampage. Cold blooded would have generated 9 AP. We matched the chat logs with the patrol ship charges in the saved logs and Terrence killed him with one shot of the natamy. Ironically, Captain 'MURICA actually made this run easier for us. <span class="tid_strike">Thanks, 'MURICA!</span> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Unfortunately, this didn't change the fact that Jin Su put two spores on Andie the day prior. We were well aware of this because of his movements but there was nothing to be done about it. In retrospect, knowing this, we should have barricaded Andie at the bridge or something.</p><p>Minutes after the death of his partner, Alpha-Kuan Ti broke cover and spiked Andie the last time. After a brief stand-off, Andie transferred into idle-Derek and murdered two of the non-n00b/idles. Terrence killed the two mush with the natamy <span class="tid_strike">and dedicated the kills to himself</span> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico">. Or something like that. I wasn't online so I only read on it after the fact. Elaborations from the rest of the crew would be appreciated <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>By the way, for those mush complaining of confidante, we only "demanded" people chitchat it when they've been exceedingly suspicious to begin with. It's not hard to hide with junk actions before submitting to it, especially back before Janice comforted Andie to the max (it would have only revealed 6 actions)</p><br><p>All the idlers died of depression and we killed transferred-idle-Andie so pilot-Janice could get the title and do comms. With four crew left, we rushed PILGRED in one day; RFS in two after Janice printed the disk; did 5 really good projects; finished comms, upgraded some drones, built a refectory sofa with lizro and <a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/Tna20w/282">cheated some aliens on a pot deal</a>, all over the next few days. We probably could have made D10 as everything was going great in all respects but <span class="tid_strike">my hentai joke was getting redundant</span> people were bored so we returned on D7.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">If anyone's wondering, the builds were :<br>Ian = Botanist, Biologist, Tech<br>Janice = Shrink, IT, NOF, Diplomat, Pilot + Admin, Comms<br>Raluca = Physicist, Detached, Tech, Sprinter + Commander<br>Terrence = RoboEx, Tech, Pilot, Shooter, Chef </span></p><p>So the next time someone whines, "my crew is idle shit!", know that you <em>can</em> sustain a ship perfectly fine with only four people <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

It is definitely possible to sustain a ship for some time just with four, although I doubt anyone would make it to Eden with only four. Sol ending with serum is a good result though.
