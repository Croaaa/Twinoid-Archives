I had thrown Ian out the dorm so chun could have a bed with Janice, and literally as soon as the message came through saying ian had left Frieda went on a rampage after being left alone, killing hua and almost killing chun. After throwing her out the room before she could kill chun, kuan ti - aided by myself throwing ian out of every room frieda tried to hide with him in, she eventually ran to the pasiphae and broke it before being killed by Kuan-ti.</p><p>We eventually returned to sol, because with all our pilots being mush or dead we had little way of ridding ourselves of the hunters, other than chun hacking the command terminal every cycle and someone else loading in fuel so we could make our getaway, wasting fuel and AP.</p><p>This was a fun game - props to Chun, Gioele, Derek, Raluca, Kuan-ti, Paola and Eleesha who made this ship fun to play.<br>I hope i can play with all of you on this ship (bar inactives) again at some point <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">.</p>

It was interesting anyway but I won't lie, it did lack a bit in content in regards to the chat.<br>The mush hunt could of been a massacre of humans, we got lucky facing a bad player and an unfortunate one. Like Stephen, I can take a bit of credit for identifying the second mush correctly although again it could of been a bad call, I think catching Roland was more "evidence" based than later catching Frieda, as she untimately revealed herself by rampaging.</p>

                <p>heh, hi guys! I was Andi!!! Sorry I was having internet connection problems so I was not that talkative and helpful! It's a shame that our pilots have all succumb to mush that triggered our pilgred repair haste. That expo was spilled milk. It did solve our O2 problems, Hydrocarbon problems and give us jumpkins but our armour was sitting at 20-30 already haha. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Also, though we have an active crew, Our semi-active Jin Su honestly has also been a burden to us. And shout out to Roland, your excuses are as bad as your jokes haha. I could never forgot how he jokes in general chat that Chun was mush. Crew had a good laugh but there was this dry feeling that stays until the end that some newb would really murder her, so kudos to you!!! That's how you make a paranoia.</p>
