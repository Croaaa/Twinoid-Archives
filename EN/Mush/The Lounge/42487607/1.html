                <p>Well the title is definitely appropriate:<br>Andie - knifed as human Terrence for being Mush<br>Paola - knifed as human Terrence for being a suspected transfer of Jin Su after he openly spored and stopped on the Bridge with no skills, and she stopped drooling in the same cycle (holding the Comms title but not doing any work, so would have been killed anyway)<br>Jin Su - knifed as human Terrence for being (Anony)Mush<br>Gioele - didn't actually attack him, but led the crew (Roland did the actual shooting) in killing him for not communicating and working on the wrong projects<br>Stephen - knifed as human Terrence for being the most likely Beta, agreed upon by the crew</p><p>We were wrong though (obviously Eleesha knew that when she suggested it), and despite almost being too fast in bouncing off her around the ship, I was finished off with a spike from Eleesha and became a Beta once again.</p><p>While we made plans to cure Eleesha once Xyloph gave us a ghost Chun (inactive in the Refectory) and the Genome Disk - I hadn't fully trusted her and had a chat with the other active humans who almost certainly weren't converted by Jin Su - it turned out my final human actions had everyone suddenly convinced I was the original convert. So although the plan swapped to me being the one to be cured, I was afraid that would actually lead to me being cured and having to kill Eleesha.<br>The main problem was Raluca, who had Detached to prevent death by morale without shooting Schroedinger and using Demoralise and also was wearing the armour I had given her while human. The Blasters were held by Roland I probably could have managed it had I not needlessly chosen Defacer to cover up the start of my rampage, but the death list restarted here:<br>Roland - knifed as Mush Terrence first for being in a different room from the rest of the crew and holding a Blaster. I Dismantled the Knife to prevent any decent retaliation<br>Terrence - showered to low health then killed in one punch with my new body, the previously inactive Derek<br>Chun - indirectly dies of morale loss from all the above deaths<br>Janice - Grenade in Bravo Dorm after shoving Ian out, then Blastered by Mush Derek<br>Hua - Grenade, Blastered then punched to death by Mush Derek</p><p>Unfortunately Ian came online again and re-entered Bravo Dorm to attack me (rather than healing the damaged Frieda, say), so my plan to finish Frieda with fists of fury had to change. Fortunately the Blaster that KT had been holding all game was going to be available for Eleesha to grab along with a Shooter book after he suicided. She had been blocking Raluca (who was hiding from me in a front turret after repairing the Jellied Bridge Camera) from coming down by guarding the Front Corridor.<br>Kuan Ti - dies of morale loss from Bravo Dorm murders<br>Frieda - Grenaded, punched, then finished off with a shot from Eleesha<br>Raluca - punched to death by Mush Derek, once I remembered we didn't have ASG so I could pull more than one spore to Phagocyte<br>Ian - shoved around before, he ended up in a Rear Storage and was traded for a Hydropot but was on zero morale anyway<br>Eleesha, Derek - killed by NERON as the only living crew members, triggered by my rampage</p><p>So other than only half a kill from Frieda and Gioele falling to Roland's Blaster, everyone died fairly directly by my hands or designs. I haven't went by the murder route before, but it was pretty fun and very effective if I do say so myself!</p><p>Kudos to Eleesha, the other super-active who helped me on both sides; Raluca (who even believed that Terrence was innocent in the end, until Eleesha spoiled it and told her I transferred to Derek) and Ian as the fairly actives who were good fun; Hua, Janice, Frieda, Roland as the kind of actives who helped the ship get by.</p>

                <p>Raluca here glad to see this ship had a ap anyways eleesha looks like you found the bottle of nail polish since you were shot out to space as well. Great play by the mush i suspected Terrence was mush since he pmed me to help him move then right as day change happened he pmed me for the knife. Which i thought was a way to spike me then went in my turret which i thought was to trap my turret for the 3rd spore but then Eleesha asked me to repair the bridge camera out of the blue. So if i got the cure i was going to stab eleesha with it but alas turns out eleesha and Derick/terrence had something to say about that. which involved guarding fc then derik murdering me my plan at that point. Was to wait for derik to come so eleesha had to unguard. so i could run to the refractory eat then go finish the cure stab eleesha or derik with it but, i was to slow and got killed great mush plays. 1 question when were you converted Eleesha. Also i can never visit Fay and Yes at Ew!! unfortunately .</p>

                <p>Unfortunately you wouldn't have been able to cure either of us since we didn't have the Chun genome map and she had just died. My fear was that you might see what was going on and try to take one of us out, which was why I dismantled the Knife as Terrence. Eleesha did make the right call to trap you on the Bridge, but I thought it would have been more interesting if she had tried to keep you on her side.</p><p>As far as conversions go, Andie was caught when she had been lying in bed all day and only got up to move the Lenses to each bay and eat a ration (getting Dirty but not reporting it, as she was silent the whole time) despite there being Hunters for her to shoot. She had trapped both bays, so when I picked up one Lens to shoot her and Eleesha got the other (along with a Blaster) to give to me, we got a spore each. Eleesha later picked up another spore from an old trap of Andie, and when Jin Su extracted his spores openly in Front Corridor he spiked her with the third one. I later picked up a trap of Eleesha's, then spiked me as I was returning from your turret.</p><p>The only reason I went to check it was to see if Jin Su had been down there, since I knew it was either Stephen (who I had just killed and found to be human), Eleesha (that encounter with Jin Su), you (Raluca is always a target) or Ian (unprotected in Medlab, other than extra AP cost) who had been turned. Our alternate plan to a fake curing was to convert you for a PILGRED rush, but since you were being so paranoid it would need to be a double spike and either one at an earlier time or a PILGRED trap. I only realised after I had finished re-arranging all the back-of-ship inventory that I should have taken the opportunity to spike you, but I was later glad I never as I used that spore to transfer into Derek before day change.</p>
