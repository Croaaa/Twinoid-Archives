                <p>Howdy folks. Starting this thread as our AP for the latest MS, Mush Superiority, casting ship to land. Short and bittersweet, perhaps. I don't usually start these threads. I'm just going to kick it off with a few comments and let it roll. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>First off, I was Paola. The ship got all juicy dramatic when our Roland, played by <span class="tid_user tid_user_8092972 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8092972">Aerial</span>, was suddenly ghosted. Roland was being all super organizey and saying things like I should eat every 3 cycles to finish two or three NERON upgrades, along with all the Xyloph and the associated rebel bases by day 3. I bemoaned the already increased size of my hips from being in the cryo-sleep chamber. Between being glued to the Comms, stuffing my face, or fat on the couch, I was stuck on the Bridge and really had no idea what came down in the nether ends of the ship other then a bunch of crew collectively going "WTF?" when Roland's death was announced.</p><p>Okay folks, carry on without me. I feel verklampt. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"> Talk amongst yerselves. I've given you a topic.</p>

It's been ~8 months since the last time I saw this skill in action <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The first torture target was Eleesha, since she entered and left Bravo Dorm right after the game start without saying anything. There were 3 free beds in BD, but she didn't lie down and walked to Alpha Dorm instead. Also she was missing 8-10 AP. I roughed her up and Chao tortured her, <span class="tid_strike">it was pretty FUN</span>. Unfortunately, there were no mush actions in the torture logs, so I healed her afterwards <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I was really surprised about the fact that <em>everyone</em> was avoiding Bravo Dorm, to the point that there was an empty bed all the time. That means nobody was extracting any spores and it was impossible to find any mush by torturing them. So I came up with the plan and I knew what we needed to do. The plan was to get Chun to guard the Central Corridor while we're checking the starvation status of everyone on D3C8 (that's when they were supposed to start starving, according to my calculations). We could have confirmed a lot of humans this way, and maybe even find a mush who forgot to eat. <br>I shouldn't have spoken about that plan with Chao, lesson learned the hard way.</p><p>D3C5 I healed the entire crew to full health to prepare for the plan, it took me a grand total of 14 AP + ration, but people on the Bridge were still injured. I asked Chao to help me with healing them, he left and entered the dorm but never dropped the medikit. That's when I thought that guy was up to no good. The medikit was crucial for the investigation, so if he didn't drop it in time I was ready to kill him right there.</p><p>The second "torture" target was...me? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/omg.png" alt=":omg:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I was online when they decided to kill me.<br>I noticed Eleesha and Chao were "online" in the chat, so I thought something is wrong, since he didn't drop the medikit and ignored me even after I was screaming in the PM to drop it ASAP. Then I saw Eleesha entered Bravo Dorm after claiming that she got dirty cooking, I refreshed again and saw she dropped the blaster. I realized that they are going to kill someone, so I clicked on the door to Bravo Bay to take off in a patroller if needed. The button had been pressed and the little circle was twirling and instead of loading into the other room, I loaded at the endpage.</p><p><cite>Roland is dead.

And what's worse is that you didn't even kill Chao after that, so he accumulated full AP bar and rampaged.</p><p>At least you guys killed Eleesha, I was <em>very</em> surprised that she was human</p><p>In the end, he didn't achieve anything by assassinating me, you guys still win by returning to Sol with RFS <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And also that was FUN <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ONGRF8z.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/ONGRF8z.png</a></p>

Within the first 10-15 minutes I dismantled the alpha dorm shower only to have Eleesha jump in the dorm and out to bravo dorm. I already announced i was holding the mush sample, so i figured I caught a mush off guard since it was WAY too early to collect logs and Bravo dorm tells you nothing you can't see from the bays &amp; rear corridor with Eleesha but chao tortured her pretty early.</p><p>Early days were mostly relaying research - attempting &amp; failing to reinforce the shower and acting as a generalist.</p><p>Seemingly randomly Chao &amp; Eleesha kill Roland with a blaster that from my standpoint she searched around the ship for. The reasoning was spotty as best even with faked torture logs - The claim being a secret shower after Roland already took a legitimate shower earlier - who wastes 2 AP for a secret shower when you could have extracted spores the first time around - likewise he took multiple showers and only took shower damage once? Chao must have had a silver tongue since Eleesha ate that right up and she even committed all her AP to killing our most active Crew member.</p><p>Eleesha was already the top suspect before - and the story was too full of holes and inside PMs to make any sense She probably could have saved herself if she invited humans to her chat but I was willing to kill her myself if need be. Chao did a good job since the main thing that saved him was Eleesha already being a suspect and the fear of killing more humans after eleesha and roland just died.</p><p>Janice was caught fairly easily - she was trying to go 100% human but forgot to eat.</p><p>Though a comical miscommunication nobody knew where Jin Su's missions were going - perhaps the mush? (they went to chun and chao so half right i guess). Rather then risk killing him with the natamy he got the cure. I wanted to kill him with the natamy but O2 was becoming a concern so I took astro and scanned planets.</p><p>O2 was getting desperate - O2 ducts may have been worthwhile but Terrance had the brilliant idea of having a day's worth of emergency O2 and not loading it. At some point I had to load 2 to survive the day but we wanted to encourage the mush to take o2 from the tanks so we left it at a continual state of emergency.</p><p>&gt;&gt;<strong>Kuan</strong>: it's an emergency right now. A mush could take 2 Caps and kill someone at the end of the cycle.<br>&gt;&gt;<strong>Hua</strong>: God I hope they do that. Would make life so easy.<br>Oh Hua .... life just got shorter - not easier</p><p>Chao bit the bait and the O2 did save us. He stole the icarus and I ended up taunting Chao during his entire expo with the cure we already wasted. He was only coming home to multiple stab wounds - but there was a chance his partner might expose himself to save him so i played it up like i had it on me.</p><p>After that it was somewhat of a guess about Stephan. He wandered in and out of bravo dorm without giving a speech (end game says no spores from him) - he did nothing mushy at all but I suspected him most because he ate twice in the first 4 days and never used that AP.</p>

                <p>If you're wondering about chao - I don't really know. I really wanted to shoot him - esp after he had an expo with an obvious traitor (a time I had 0 AP looking for planets). I was mostly blocked since Ian was holding the natamy rifle and had a PM with only Hua.</p><p>In the human channel the topic pretty much died (shortly after eleesha's death) when hua said:<br><strong>&gt;&gt; Hua :</strong> I'm still not sure we're going after Chao. :/ Ian seems to have doubts, he's the other person I'm talking to.</p><p>a lot of the other human's stopped talking/ went idle so there was no real voting and I trusted Hua after she killed Janice and got gastro - a log that i confirmed personally with no possibility of a transfer or infection.</p><p>Is it worth noting that with Roland gone - Hua had her hands full with hunters and its possible we just didn't have any other active / trusted humans with AP.</p>

                <p>If you played Chao that would be true. The problem there is if chao was just a bad player then I would be in the same spot as eleesha. We had a lot of suboptimal play this match so i could have set myself up to randomly punch the only other investigator to death. Consider this - all Janice needed to do was eat and she would have survived - she didn't do it as part of a master plan, she just ignored chao's instructions after you told him you were looking at starvation. Player error is a thing - I've had human Jin Su's head West rather than East.</p>

                <p>Chao here. Thanks for a very fun ship, guys. My skills in the end were Splashproof and Traitor. I was a level 7 mush.</p><p>Roland makes it sound like you were just too slow in killing me, but the fact is I survived for DAYS after killing him. I didn't just have enough time to save up for a rampage, I had enough time to save up for several.</p><p>However, I knew that there was a lot of PMs I weren't privy to and that meant I was still a big suspect. It was only a matter of time until you eliminated enough people so that I became the next target so I made the best move I could given the circumstances. It didn't help that Janice died early and Stephen was basically a non-entity that game.</p><p>If anyone was wondering how I found the blasters (I told Eleesha where to search, if any of you had noticed), I used all of the logs Roland had kept so meticulously. They clearly showed Hua dropping the blaster in CC and then Chun passing through... after which I passed through and I knew there hadn't been a blaster then. Also, they showed Chun going into CBS and since she hadn't picked up the second blaster, it was a safe assumption to say that her inventory had been full at this point so odds were she just hid it.</p><p>I have to say, the amazingly fast research completely screwed us over. When constipaspore serum was done before I even logged on the first time, I realized that there was no way we would be able to play sporing mush that game. How do you hide 4AP when you are already trying to hide the 4AP you aren't getting from eating?</p>

In the aftermath of Roland's death, you weren't a target because I still wanted to follow up the starvation plan. We didn't carry out the 'Guard-CC' section, but I think it was the right choice anyway since it caught Janice. After <em>that</em>, the plan was not to make any more rash decisions and go for the safest plan: rush Pheromodem. Of course a lot longer than I wanted, but...</p><p>The day I we completed it, you came <em>so</em> close to getting Natamied! In fact, I tracked down Ian, it was the only time we actually traded the knife for the rifle, I told him and all the confirmed humans I was going to kill you, and then....we started having doubts. Ian was never confirmed human, but I trusted him a lot, so when he said he wasn't sure it was a good idea my courage started to fade. Then we got the idea that Jin Su was the best suspect and that we should cure him, which if he was Mush it didn't make sense to kill anyone until after we cured him. That wasn't quite why I didn't kill you though.<br> What made me give the rifle back was the Hunters. After Roland died the situation got worse and worse, and I put off pilot duties as long as I could to Mush hunt. But at that point we had Hunters consistently wearing us down and the Shield was more than halfway down. I threw my hands up in the air, gave Ian the rifle back and went off to go fight Hunters instead. Which I wasn't very good at since 2H cycles + a max of 10 AP thanks to Depression from killing Janice is a terrible combo. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> But really I deserved to get killed for not just <em>doing it</em>. Thanks for a fun mush hunt Chao, I wish all casting games had mush that played as well as you did.</p>

                <p>Janice here...<br>I will apologize once again - to Chao and to the rest of the people. Because of the sudden sickness I wasn't able to give everything here and I'm really disappointed with my play. Even with Chao saying about the eating, I missed the moment I should do that. <br>Those two spores Mush team made was on me. Like Roland said - those two standard research are easily countered. With five cameras and alarms ready I wanted to trap Bravo Bay, hoping that Roland or Hua could catch some spores. <br>Roland was killed. I wasn't able to do what I had to do. <br>I'm not surprised that Chao wanted to get rid of the most active player on board, seems like you can do a lot of damage even without extracting a spore.</p>

                <p>Jin Su here.</p><p>First of all, BVAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHH. As my second casting, I <em>again</em> had a Chun that simply refused to help and with that I was 99% out of the mushiness topic. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Day 1 I spent all my AP on relayin research and getting 2 (3?) researches done in the first cycles, then giving 2 speeches, so it seemed great so far. The problem was that after that I used my AP to either navigate or pilot, then rest without a bed, as I avoided the dorms to help the anti-mush cause.</p><p>Chun, I know oyu must had your duties, but goshdarnit I asked 2 times in the public chat to open a private message, and once in the human channel ,but I <em>never</em> got any answers.<br>At that point I just listened to the certified human channel, who...well barely had any ideas and were mostly just reacting on the mush's actions. They even used the serum on me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">, which is strange as...I wasn't the most important one on the ship, nor the most suspicius (I was in about 5 rooms at max and never showered if I remember correctly).<br>Sending a mission to Chao was a tough decision, as apart from Chun (who was uncommunicative with me), I had noone to trust. Chao had a "good" reason to need the mission, so I was "eff it" and sent.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>Also, what do you guys think about the <strong>2 hour cycles</strong>?<br>For me it was quite bad, as I usually never have AP wasted, yet here sleeping/not being at home/etc meant that I had 1-2 AP overflowing most of the time, once even losing my glooorious commandeering title and having the ship waiting for me on expos as I just stood around in IC for a pilot or back at the bridge. It was just...weirldy fiddly allgame <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"></p>

The 2 people that survived past day 4 were Chao and stephan - neither of which extracted spores all game. I counted AP and closely looked at who came in the bravo dorm and the actions they took before hand. It's one of the reasons I suspected Eleesha more than Chao - she had no reason to go to bravo dorm while Chao's first shower was after using 6 AP on eleesha from a human's request. Stephan survived only because he avoided bravo dorm - we all knew he was putting less AP than most of the crew but there were a few people that wasted AP from the 2 hour cycles as well.</p>

                <p>Sometimes it's just how things get setup. Favorable environmental conditions, including the human environment. Chao had a silver tongue. There was definitely a lot of holes in what he said, and people called some of them out publicly. Then there was Eleesha who was looking very mushy by unhiding all of the weapons Chun had hidden, the BD entry, her not using the apron when researching. We suspected them both. Chun was convinced Eleesha was mush but when she didn't just die at the Natamy shot, Chun didn't heal her in time ("real life got in the way" ) . Okay, that happens to all of us. Anyway, that sure throw us off our conviction about mush hunting I think (WAIT for Chun when you have Chun in a thread, talk with more confirmed humans). Ian got big on his pacifism, and I added that we needed to be more careful about broader conversation before killing. I'm sad to hear the RFS was wasted on Jin Su, but the threat of it against Chao was quite effective so kudos for that one folks!</p><p>Since I was never visibly sick or badly affected by the killings I wasn't in the ensuing mush hunt channels. I had a bad feeling about Chao but not enough PA to do Comms and check a bunch of logs. I distrusted Stephen for a long loitering in the FC, and then being on the Bridge sucking my LE and doing nothing.</p><p>I was surprised and pleased when Hua killed mushy Janice. I didn't know until here how that was determined. There was never a public answer in the game about how Janice was found out.</p><p>Oh speaking of Ian "never proven human" per Hua above. Ian actually was proven human to me. It was one of those accidental proofs. It was mentioned publicly but I guess not everyone saw it. Maybe only me? Anyway, Ian offered sometime after it happened that he "couldn't resist" using the Spore Sucker because he wanted to see how it worked even though he didn't have a spore. He posted this in the Research thread I think. Took 2 damage from it but didn't get dirty. It was suspicious to me because he had the Mycologist skill. Anyway, I've never seen it used, and the Mushpedia says that the Mush can't use it, so that said to me he was human. I discussed it with him in PM and said we shouldn't talk about it anymore because it was technically against the Casting rules.</p><p>Other things that threw me off while I was stuck on the Bridge was Ian doing these sorts of n00b things that a level 4 Ian shouldn't be doing, and also holding on to the blaster "for Natamy research", then holding on the Natamy when it was done (granted it was after Chun went Postal on Eleesha). Also there was a time when we wanted to rush Pheroderm and Finola held the apron for about 18 hours.</p><p>A few people did things without the apron anyway, like pushing Pheroderm, understandable, but then there was like 3 people saying "I know I've been dirty for a while. Please be patient with me for a little longer while <strong>I not shower</strong>. I was like 'WHAAAAT THE FFFFFU....?!?!!?' I held my human head high and refused to eat my cooked ration, which by then had to be going bad, without the apron. By the time I ate it, it gave me food poisoning. I wanted to parade myself around the ship barfing so I could get in with the rest of the humans but it would have been against Casting rules as I had no reason to go anywhere but the Bridge. So I stormed back to the Bridge without even a wet burp passing my lips. No vomit logs...no one was able to know but me!!! <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/angry.gif" alt=":anim_bad:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/drowl.gif" alt=":anim_drowl:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I don't recall exactly what happened next but crisis ensued and Frieda was like 'get your fat ass off the Bridge and help us back here!' and off I went to fire fight. When I woke up in AD Kuan Ti was shooting at Stephen. I freaked out, ran screaming from the room "Kuan Ti is MUSSSSHHH!! He's killing Stephen in AD now!!" Hahahaha. Ofc, I was totally wrong.</p><p>After that we rushed PILGRED b/c Raluca's player had an urgent family matter that was unexpectedly taking him away from keyboard for 7 days. I was nervous about our last mush but everyone else was like WE MUST DO THIS and I knew I was still a lone unproven human crying wolf about Kuan Ti. I wasn't sure we could trust Raluca to not be mush but what did I know, the little island of Paola on the Bridge?</p><p>Again, off to sleep to wake up to a 3 deaths! Wow, two hour cycles are amazingly FUN! Read, read, read, and it's all good. Back to Sol because we have so little oxygen. Then the ship played a FUNny and killed Finola picking up the Medikit.</p><p>Oh maaaan. It's almost like Shakespeare was on this ship.</p>

I checked on you Day 4 C4 and saw (Neron 3.74, all of xyloph, 2 bases done) but I wasn't confident enough in my ability to count coms AP to say you were 100% human for it.</p>

                <p>Considering Chao lied about the torture logs which cannot be confirmed what he saw, yes I see you are right. There is no log of what happened with the spore sucker if anything, so no real reason to trust Ian. I've seen many a mush save the ship every day with plans to get to Sol/Eden, so that isn't ever really proof for me. I was also stricken with illness in real life so it was about all I could do to make sure I did my Comms work in as timely a manner as I could. I didn't really have it in me to argue my goodness in chat, or to harangue and question things in chat. In all, I enjoyed the ship. I look forward to another one with 2 hour cycles. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Your friendly pacifist <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"> here. This was my second time playing the gardener and first time at Level 4. A few random notes:</p><p>I acted a bit n00bish on this ship. I honestly did not know how the spore sucker worked. I thought the availability of the action might mean I had a spore. Paranoia set in and I didn't want to announce it on the public chat ... the mind works in funny ways sometimes. Somehow it didn't make me dirty. Maybe it only does if you get a spore off? I only announced it later because I knew room logs were being collected and for some reason I didn't want to have to explain getting the heals. I hadn't been to Bravo Dorm. Like I said, the mind works in funny ways sometimes. Anyway, I could have been lying and I probably <strong>should</strong> have just lied if it came up.</p><p>I didn't know that the Blaster had to be on the shelf to research Natamy. I don't know how I didn't know this. You learn something new every ship, at least I do.</p><p>It's funny about Stephen at the end there. With the D2 eating for no reason, soaking up Logistics, and doing random stuff without fully reading the chat, he was definitely high on the suspect list. But that trip through Bravo Dorm at the end was totally legitimate: he was trying to find and heal me. Thanks for the heals, Stephen. We killed him pretty much right after that.</p><p>I pm'd Finola at one point trying to get us to swap heals in Medlab. She logged on several times after that but never responded to me. In light of how her trip ended, well, I'm just sayin'.</p><p>Hua, you were Derek on my last public ship. The one where you heroically hacked the BIOS and launched our <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> saving expo, only to die on that expo. I was Ian and asked you if you wanted me to clear out so you could kill the human Jin Su right before then. I wish you had. That ship had potential but he blocked us in every way imaginable without actually griefing. We almost died solely because of him.</p>

                <p>Ok, here are my main thoughts about the ship:</p><p>It did not go according to plan (oh boy, did we go off script) but this was one of the most interesting and fun ships I have been on, and I have to hand it to Chao for playing the manipulative villain to perfection.</p><p>You wouldn't have known it from the first 2.5 days. We were setting up for an efficient run, the mush hunters seemed to have a firm grip on everything, and everything was just going smoothly. I really just thought this was going to be a dull, zero-PvP ship ending with my first Eden. Nope.</p><p>Chao planted <strong>just enough</strong> doubt with his post murder speeches to make some of us consider that he could have been an overzealous and misguided human. Yes, we should have assumed that the torture log was fake, and no, torturer Chao should never make a mistake like this. The way it went down <em>should</em> have shown us clearly that it was never his intention to try to prove Roland human. He sold it well, and the miss on Eleesha probably saved him. I didn't know at the time about her odd behavior, so Chun killing her made it feel like we were totally disorganized. Two humans dead, and possibly a third if Chao did turn out to be a hapless mush hunter after all.... It seemed at that point like we were letting the ship get away from us.</p><p>Once Janice was dead and Pheromodem finished, Hua came to get the Natamy Rifle from me. We started chatting for the first time, and I expressed some doubts about Chao. One reason I gave was that killing Roland was something no mush would ever expect to get away with. The boldness itself was what made me think it was a stretch. We both dove into the logs. I pointed out how some stuff matched up with Jin Su. Some of that relied on the mush channel entry we had revealed. It talked about getting Janice where they wanted by calling for hugs. Moral of the story: <em>Ignore the chatter in the mush channel. It is fake. It is there to misdirect you.</em> I know this should be obvious.</p><p>I think the bigger mistake was not killing Chao as soon as that disaster expo was over. After the Roland murder it was one thing to let him off with one more chance, but from that point on any whiff of something bad should have been an autokill. That's on us.</p><p>After that we wasted the RFS on Jin Su, and I was pretty demoralized feeling like I'd mostly been a hindrance up to that point. So I dropped the Natamy and took myself out of any active mush hunting. I figured Chao was probably mush and that Hua, Kuan Ti, and Jin Su would handle it. Hua hinted that it was about to happen at one point, but nothing materialized.</p><p>So, Chao was able to strike those final blows and saddle us with a real <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> crisis. That's about the time I started to realize that Kuan Ti (I didn't know Terry was involved with this) had been injecting our reserve <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> a capsule or two at a time. That was brilliant. It always looked like we'd start suffocating by the end of the day, but then magically a little extra would appear and the 7 pots would push us through. Fun stuff.</p><p>Overall it was a tense, draining, silly, and very interesting mush experience. Paola's alternating paranoia and goofiness was fun, and I enjoyed mush hunting/logic puzzling in little spurts with Hua and Kuan Ti. It seems like Terrence was doing a lot behind the scenes. I'd like to know more about that, as well as any notable or funny stuff happening in other PMs which seemed to be an especially big part of this one.</p><p>And of course the ending, while it sucked for Finola, was the perfect capper to a ridiculous journey.</p>
