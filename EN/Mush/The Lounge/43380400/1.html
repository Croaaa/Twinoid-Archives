                <p>All right... How to start? How about giving info about actuall ship? Here You go!</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6364" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6364</a></p><p>And of course, as You might guessed I am Your lovely and totally harmles <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> Alpha Mush.</p><p>I will start my story saying that I tired to jump on same ship with friend of mine. We tried our best to coordinate on same ship. I jumped as Raluca and gave Him list of characters that didn't woke up yet. He said "It matches my choise options! I will try with Jin Su!" and in same moment Jin Su woken up from cryo on our ship... No - we were not succesfull. We landed on separate ships actually ^^ That was coincident, that caused funny conversation betwen me and Jin Su and a bit of confusion (in private chat - not in open disscusion). It also made me feel like idiot <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> But that didn't had any impast on what was happening later, so I just put it here just... I don't know why? Because that is kind of funny coincidence? Ok, ok! I am going to the point now. I prommise!</p><p><strong>First glance</strong></p><p>Ship seemed like one of those rare extremly active ones. Moreover it's crew looked like very competent, communicative and carefull. Only exeption to this was Stephen who was idling in Refectory (I didn't know it was Stephen - I only saw red dot on tracker). We had three gold players (Roland, Terrence and Jin Su), and many silver (Raluca, Frieda, Kuan Ti, Andie, Chun, Derek... I don't know if anybody else?). Shower was already dismantled by Terrence which is extremly rare for me to expirience! I mean... GUYS! That was shower that I as a technican DIDN'T had to dismantle!!! When I play as Tech character than most often I find myself only technican on ship. And if there is more of us - I am one that must take care of that shower. And here it was diffrent! Nice ship! Really great!</p><p>Ba! I will tell more! Our Jin Su was... STRATEGURU! Rare occasion... First time I saw it being picked at all... Funny part is that same Jin Su was NOT pilot! Leader, Shooter, Logistic Expert and Strateguru. Jin Su! Your chooice of skills was helpful for Mushes! Live and die with that knowledge!</p><p>I decided to not waste any time - picked only reasonable skills for Lvl 3 Silver Raluca (Physicist and Tech) and decided to report on discusion that I am bronze Raluca with Detached Crewmember <em>(Yes <strong>Impet</strong> - I do know You are reading it, and do know that I still can not resist making games on others!)</em>. Soon my little "I have wrong skills" game was beaten by Andie who reported being Pilot and Devoted insted of Pilot and Polyvalent. Andie - You made my own trick on me. As You saw it - I can not forget such things! ^^ Anyway - apart from those two "Skills pranks" all seemed like we will get awesome ship, that will lead us to Eden...</p><p><strong>Slow decay</strong></p><p>First impresions are important... But often they are wrong. I will only say that ship faded into... Well... I will not call it "inactivity" because only inactives we had were Stephen, Hua and Gioele. I will call it "Lower activity". People started to speack less, do less and coordinate less... Magic of Christmas!!! So what started to look like great ship to try Eden - ended as ship that could propably last 10 days, finish RFS and return Sol if there would be no Mushes on board and if crew would not make few mistakes when it came to planet selection. But let's not go too much into future, ok? I just wanted to show that state of ship and it's crew was worse than originaly it would look.</p><p><strong>My first humman moves and actions</strong> <em>(pre-mush selection)</em></p><p>Seeing that there is nothing requiring Technican help I decided to push PILGRED at start to 20% and work a bit on NERON Projects. Than I went to Medlab and took it for myself untill next day (there was plenty of free beds as many people simply didn't used those). That was all that I made before Mushes were selected... However I did also two important things related to social interactions. I SINCERELY DO ADVICE DOING THOSE ON EVERY SINGLE SHIP IF YOU ARE LIKE ME <em>ANTI-FOOD</em> TEST AND <em>PRO-RPing</em> PERSON.</p><p>1. Firstly I informed everybody that I am going to RP Raluca, and they should not feel offended or personaly attacked when I will tell them something not nice on main disscusion, as that is how I do imagine Antisocial Raluca to be - this was well accepted by crew. Especially by RPing part of crew.</p><p>2. Secondly I informed straight away that I am against food tests and will always refuse to make one for the sake of proving myself being humman, nor I will ask others to make such tests. In same time I did informed that in emergency for AP boost I am willing to eat twice, or for morale... Or for health. Just not for the sake of prooving myself - this was met with even greater acceptance from crew.</p><p><strong>Mush, mush, mushy girls and boys!</strong></p><p>So... I return from my work on next day... I log in and what? I am mush... Did I got converted in Medlab? Infector? Again?! No! Nobody entered here... When... Oh! Once cycle before... But... I see... <strong><em>FIRST TIME AS ALPHA MUSH!!! I waited for this 30+ ships! Yay!!!</em></strong> Also I see that my partner in Mush is Roland - Gold Player! CAN IT BE BETTER?! Umm... Anything would be better. Seriously - any other person on that ship (including inactive Hua) would be better partner than Roland. I think it is only fair to say few things about my estemed partner in Mush. Than you will know why I do say things like this.</p><p><em>Roland</em> was not only new to being Mush. He was generaly newbie! So... Firstly we both were Mushes for first time. But apart of this, He was not expirienced player and He didn't knew many things. Many elemental things. Like what? How to extract spores! What makes You dirty! How to shoot hunters! Yea! Things like that. And He was gold. But apart of that He was <em>extremly unreliable!!!</em> Honestly - planing things with Him was real inferno for me. We had agreement to do something and than He was doing something COMPLETLY opposite! "Roland - come to Nexus and spike Derek now. No camera, only I and He - it is great occasion!". 5 minutes later I get message in Mush Channel that Stephen was infected with 1 spore <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Derek was active, silver and expirienced player. Stephen? Inactive in Refectory. All right... It may be also of value... But WHY spike once Stephen when Derek already has 2 spores?! WHY? I was gentle, I was patient, I was speacking multiple times. Nothing was helping. When it cames into infecting people I had no help from Him. Worse - He was extracting spores so I could not!!! <strong>Do not get me wrong! I totally understand being newbie to game and I am not disapointed by that. What I am disapointed thoguh is lack of any willingnes to work together and communicate properly. This is social game - communication is most important part of it.</strong></p><p>As I said - Roland was Gold, but He was only lvl 2 Mush which left Him without any really powerfull skills.</p><p>But was He TOTALLY useless? Answer is NO! He was a pilot. Mush pilot is a one less pilot to worry about for me. And while Roland was VERY poor at cooperating when it came to DO SOMETHING, He was more than willing to NOT DO things that would help hummans. So hunters were major problem for hummans. At least that (and only that).</p><p><em>Raluca</em> (me!) was silver player with 30+ ships of expirience, but only 3 as mush, and never as an Alpha Mush. I was lvl 11 Mush so I had acces to Fertile which allowed me to hide AP usage better (if somebody would be counting my AP from begining of the ship till moment that it ended He would noticed that I lacked 6 AP only - 4 times direct infection and one coffe), cope with CSerum (which came rather late and helped me more than caused problems - 4 Ap pers spore was problematic for Roland so he could not "steal" all my spores) and get upper hand in race for spores with Roland &gt;.&lt; My second skill was of course Anonymush, which I took after succesfully turning Derek into Mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It is getting long, so I will post it and continue in next message <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p><strong>My plan - let's take over the world!</strong></p><p>So... Roland was newbie and was my partner. Problematic partner... I explained at begining that I am planing for long game. I don't want anything other than: Sol Infiltration, Eden Invasion (right...) or Total Conversion. I put things crystal clear from begining and He agreed. Unfortunatly this ship was not fit to any of those outcomes as time showed. Also I am not sure if I would managed to actually end it in any of those outcomes. So I had also my private aim apart of those three.</p><p>What was it? To kill Chun? To blow up whole ship? To exterminate everybody on board? NO! Something much better! Simple plan really... To be interesting. To be such Mush that will make story interesting for others. To let them have longer Mush Hunt than 2 - 3 days. To make them feel paranoia! That was, and still will be my very personal aim - to not play dull. No stupid early rampages. No running away in Parshipae with extinguishers. When I am mush - none of that happenes (I still regret my first time being Beta Mush when I did insta rampage - shame on me!). Of course if discovered I would rampage. Or when rampage would be only way to actually win it... Or when ship would be THAT bad that it would be an act of mercy rather than anything else. Point is - no early rampages <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So that were my long-term plans. Short term plan was more precise - I wanted Kuan Ti to become Beta Mush. As You can see it didn't worked out. But good Derek was at hand insted ^^ And I do not regret! It was awesome Mush Partner! Just awesome! I could not get better one! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But that is another story in latter part of post.</p><p><strong>My first moves as MUSH!</strong></p><p>So... I was in Medlab with full AP... And I was Alpha Mush. I knew also that my true place was Engine Room. I decided that best course of action will be to behave totally humman untill I will manage to get some spores. I also saw that our main researcher (Andie) was offline for one day ^^ So no limits for me or Roland <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Well... I will tell that research started VERY slow, but started to get faster later on. First thing I did was to help with Sol connection - succes! Raluca managed to do it ^^ Than I decided to help Chun in taking care of dangerous weapons <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I saw Grenade lying freely in Bravo Bay - so I picked it up and made very clear message that I will give it only to Chun, and nobody else. In response Derek (Humman, Shooter and Wrestler) took Blaster and said that He will hold on it and give it away only to Chun as well. I just expressed that I don't see any problems with that. Chun soon made it clear that I have to take grenade to Medlab (FANTASTIC! I just walked from Medlab to Bridge and than Engine Room, only to have to return again to Medlab, and than again walk to Engine Room - just wonderfull!!!) On my way I found Grenade BP - decided it is also worthy of giving to Chun. Her reaction? "You should have bring me Babel Module BP!".</p><p>I was SO tempted to blow Her up with that grenade and finish Her up... But no! I decided to play cool. She WILL get what She deserves for that! Raluca does not forget Chun! &gt;.&lt; Insted I decided to give Chun advice - "Chun, I would like You to take one extinguisher from Rear Corridor and hide it in case we will get Pyro Mush". Of course this is very important thing to do as Pyro Mushes are just annoying and it is good to counter them with hidden extinguisher. What did Chun? NOTHING! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> She just ignored that. Fine! Have Your way. You will end up once on ship with all extinguishers dismantled and few fires started - You will learn as I learned!</p><p>But please - do not think that Chun was poor player or anything like that - She was competent, She was helping Ian with plants and was pushing research nicely (for a time She was main researcher as Andie was AFK). She also was enforcing good discipline on ship. <strong>One thing this ship was really great was keeping people unter cameras! Even 2 out of 3 inactives were under cameras! Only Ian </strong><em>(pacifist)</em><strong> and Stephen </strong><em>(inactive)</em><strong> were not.</strong> At begining I saw litelary no other chances to convert than by infecting those who help on PILGRED. I know! I know - there are other ways, but keep in mind that I was first time an Alpha Mush - with nobody else to help me or guide me! Ok? ^^</p><p>I had also another problem - do You remember that I pushed PILGRED twice (up to 20%) while still humman? Yep - that decision actually decided to bite me in my ass. I didn't had any resonable way to get dirty BEFORE asking for PILGRED relay... Also there were Mushes on board so working on PILGRED too fast was not wise decision as well.</p><p>And yet another problem - I planed that Kuan Ti (Silver Astro and Tech) will be my first Beta Mush. Unfortunatly Frieda (Silver Pilot and in last cycles Astro) dedicated Herself to piloting (which She was doing VERY good) so Kuan Ti dedicated Himself to Astronavigation. So it was out of question to count on HIM doing relays for me. Now it could be anybody else, and each time diffrent person... Or worse - Chun! &gt;.&lt; Plans had to be changed... And changed they were!</p><p>Firstly I wanted to have a bed. 16 AP pers day keeps Chun away <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Janice (Bronze Shrink) was VERY helpfull with that. <strong>Janice! Thank You soooooo much for Your support! I am affraid that without You I could not make it ^^ You were rewarded by me later my dear!</strong> I contacted Her, and asked if She has any free bed for me. Things didn't went THAT easy. There was bed, but soon Eleesha (Bronze Tracker) took it before I managed to come online again. But that actually in the end helped me more due to coincidence. You see... I hadn't managed to get dirty, and stealth showering with this Chun, Kuan Ti and Derek was simply OUT OF QUESTION! That would be death sentence in instant - too competent and observative (I am not saying rest were not like that!). What to do? What to do? Push one more time PILGRED? Might be a good idea... But would look very strange to do it third time in row... AND BOOM! <em>Kuan Ti</em> found a planet worthy exploration! No oxygene but other good stuff! And Jin Su want to get there ASAP. No problem! I was sooo nice to load up fuel ^^ And extracted spore. And got dirty ^^ Uff... One spore in my pocket... And day change - second spore in my pocket as well... How good to be me! Dirty queen! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I decided to stay in Engine Room insted of going to Dorms, as I didn't wanted to shower without Splashproof to often... Understandable I think ^^ Oh! There is tha PILGRED and I need relay on it... I will ask for it to come after Day change <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And I did asked. Now... Who will come! Will it be Janice to get my first spore of love? Or that handsome Derek? Or maybe that nice old granny Frieda? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> What wonderfull person will recive Spore of Love from me? &gt;.&gt; Roland came in, relayded PILGRED and went out. Without getting dirty (back than I thought that He will be of any use in conversions). He not only made sure nobody will come to get spore from me (YES! I was sitting in front of monitor and refreshing every10 seconds while reading book), but also He wasted occasion to extract spores... Well... He is newbie so understandable. Not good, but understandable. So I lectured Him about that.

                <p>Derek here. I'm enjoying your post so far. It's like I'm reading a nice short story and waiting for the villains to reveal themselves, the protagonists to make their last stand and for the glorious highlights even though I know what happened in the end (my end, that is). So I'm looking forward for you finishing it, so I can enjoy this from another point of view than my own.</p><p>But on a side note I would like to apologize to the human team for the lack of care that I displayed when helping Raluca in the Nexus one time too much. I would like to add, though that if there is no camera in the Nexus, the ship's overall quality is not that great. We had a Gioele who was doing things (quite franky I don't really remember what exactly) but unfortunately he was not paranoid. It was suspicious that Raluca wanted me to relay her over and over again; It was suspicious that she invited me to relay and then only did two pushes; It was suspicious that she was occupying a bed the entire time (she had valid points to do so as a human would, though) and it was highly suspicious that she wanted me to come "disarm" the Nexus in case it was spored by Roland when he was there (1000 points for that - quick and smart reaction to use Roland's utter uselessness this way) but as time on the ship passed and as was said, the activity began to dwindle I also cared less and less and continued helping her while shrugging in real life. I thought, if I can help advance Plasma Shield as soon as possible: good - if I get converted: even better.</p><p>So, in the aftermath the decision was the right one - much to the displeasure of the unknowing human team. But know this: if we hadn't so many lazy people on board, I wouldn't have been the only one to relay Raluca as should have done other people who typically work in the Nexus like Terrence, Janice and Kuan Ti. If Terrence did that right from the start, Chun won't have decided to kill him because would have actually done something useful.</p><p>But okay, I'm drifting away from the showstar here who was none other than Raluca, so please go ahead and continue, I'd love to read the rest.</p>

                <p>Oh! Here comes my great Beta Mush! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Nice to see that I managed to motivate You to participate in AP <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Too bad that only You so far (not counting Flash - but He is not from our ship).</p><p><cite>We had a Gioele who was doing things (quite franky I don't really remember what exactly) but unfortunately he was not paranoid. </cite></p><p>Actually - He was paranoid. He simply went inactive while hugging His precious cameras. Three cycles after You got converted, He put them in Labolatory and Nexus ^^ Right in time I say <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Right in time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But I think that was better... If every place would be under camera it would end up propably in me doing some sabotage or something else that would be lacking this all drama ^^ This way it was at least interesting till Frieda died... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>All right. Time to continue my story... So... Where did I ended it? Uh... Right... Roland came into Engine Room and relayed PILGRED... Right...</p><p><strong>Roland must die!</strong></p><p>From this moment I felt it that Roland will be problematic for me. I could not known Him well yet, but I litelary knew that He will be more trouble than worth. So what I decided to do? Only thing that was benefiting for Mush. I told Chun about that. I contacted Chun and said Her "Roland entered Engine Room while I was idling inside to give me relay on PILGRED". Now... I asked for this relay, didn't I? So what is this? First I ask for relay and than I report somebody for giving it to me? Well... As I said I asked for rleay and I was waiting to spike (and refreshing every 10 second while reading book). But as everybody, I also need some rest and go to sleep from time to time (usually from C1 to C3). So just before I went to bed I made BIG, <strong>f</strong><em>l</em><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong>s</strong><em>h</em><strong><em>y</em></strong> message about how I am affraid of others and how I do not wish anybody to enter Engine Room while I am offline. And only AFTER this Roland came in and did what He did. So I made that message, decided to idle in ER to make sure that NOBODY will make that relay while I am unable to spike, him and HE just comes in and destroys all plan. So now You know - my report on Him to Chun should be eoungh to get rid of Him AND in same time make me trusted. Ehh... How nicely it sounds, don't You agree? JOKING! Haha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> No. In reality I reported Him to Chun because of diffrent thing. Yes, getting rid of Him would have been awesome. Gaining total trust would be even better! But real motivation was much simpler - <strong>what if Chun would enter Engine Room and started ask why Roland was here and I didn't said about it anything? In reality I was affraid of this scenario so I reported Him to Chun.</strong> <em>In same time I DID told Roland about His mistake, and how I have to tell Chun that He was walking through Engine Room, so He knew that.</em></p><p>Chun's reaction? "You should not be in Engine Room!". JESUS! What is wrong with Her? She have pilot who is doing anything but piloting, that enters Engine Room while Raluca is there AND MADE VISIBLE INFO regarding that and that no trespassers are allowed, and all that She ever did was "You should not be in Engine Room!". Fine, fine. Actually that is good for Mush to have such Chun on board. If You ask me - Roland should get few punches from Derek back than. But what can I know? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Anyway - Roland just survived His own death, and I was no longer in danger of being asked to explain why I allowed Him to go through Engine Room without reporting (actually this would be dangerous as She might decide to eliminate both Roland and me - never know what Chun will create in that head of her).</p><p>Having acomplished nothing I decided to at least get bed in Janice's Dorm (unfortunatly not Shower Dorm). So I asked her again if there are free beds, and there was one! That one belonged to Andie (Silver Polyvalent Pilot). Yes - Andie was back so research started to actually go faster. Gas was already done when I was offline. But hey! I had already two spores. I needed only one more to complete conversion. How hard can that be? Ehh... But there was a problem - to get bed I had to shower myself firstly. And no splashproof... Well... I went to Shower Dorm, picked up soap and showered myself. <strong>That is how i lost <em>5 HP</em>!!!</strong> Now... How did it happened? Mush loose only 3 HP from showering. But as it happened I lost another 2 from accident. So using shower ended up in me loosing 2 HP AND 3 HP from being Mush. Wonderfull! How was I supposed to explain THAT? I could not suddenly start asking Chun (Silver MoH and Nurse) for healing due to some accidental HP loss... I could ask for that BEFORE showering, not after. Equaly good I could just extract spores in front of everybody... I risked that nobody will check on me with Medkit. AFAIK nobody did. Or maybe somebody did, but decided it is nothing big? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It is good place to say so if You did. Well? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And here I must say that RGN really hated Mush in this ship. Really. Firstly it picked for Mushes two players that never were playing as Alpha Mush. Secondly it picked up one player that was total newbie. Now this - 5 HP with no way of healing... &gt;.&lt; And that is not end.</p><p>On brighter note - RGN hated also Hummans ^^ Will elaborate later <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway - now I had bed, Janice was "imprisoned" in my dorm AND I had two spores waiting for somebody nice to accept them. What else coudl I asked for? Only for a partner that would actually cooperate <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Plan was simple - ask somebody to work with me on NERON Projects in Nexus, check if it is camera free zone (Gioele WAS paranoid and inactive), and if Yes - spike my prey <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> That is when I first crossed my path with Derek - He was only one that was ready to work in Nexus with me. Unfortunatly I could only push project twice - and that was VERY suspicious for Him. Luckily I had two good counter arguments. Or at least good eoungh to make Him not kill me on sight: I didn't had bed previously and I had to do all that walk with grenade. If Derek would decided to count my AP very carefully He would noticed that I lack 1 AP only. AP used to directly spike Him in Nexus. Everything else was countable and I honestly didn't had AP to push project more than twice.</p><br><p>All right childrens... Do You want to hear more? ^^ Now I am going sleep. Tell me if You are interested in hearing more or not <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> We will see tommorow about that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

As Derek mentioned - He started to suspect me because I asked only Him to help me. But there happened few things that could dull His senses. My GREATEST ally was... Ian! What Ian did? On first day He took care of plants... And forgot an Apron! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And with Roland strange behavior across ship it was not easy to tell who Mushes are... Especially if one take into account that I managed my AP very good and was rather carefull about that. Ian was sleeping in Shower Dorm so He was under greater suspicion than others... Especially after that careless plant work.</p><p>Another person who did wrong was Terrence. He started nice by dismantling shower and finding Mush Sample. However - dismantling shower took place BEFORE mush selection (all right - next person to comment something - please tell me if "MUSH" should be always with capital M or not, as I don't know...), and Mush Sample was on bridge... Under camera. So no way to hide it without leaving info in Logs. On top of that He was idling on bridge leaching out Logistic Bonus. Than in Lab where we didn't had cameras (Gioele was Paranoid, but also inactive, and without any skills back than, so no way to get those cameras even by killing him). And Terrence all that time was doing exacly nothing at all. Out of sudden He managed to get dirty, picked cat and gave him hug and went on bridge? I don't know exacly what happened, but Chun decided that it is good to act at once. She contacted Derek and ordered Him to kill Terrence. Derek was still humman that was about to get spicked for second time by me in Nexus. However I didn't knew WHO Chun wanted to kill, and when I asked Derek to help me with projects He said that He can not as He will have to kill somebody.</p><p>What happened in Mush channel than? I started to write down for Roland instructions what He should and should not do if I will get killed, what actions may be good, and which He should avoid. Etc, etc. I litelary felt how tension was hitting me... I was THAT close to do something stupid. I even considered taking off camera and spicking Derek so Roland will have easier work after I got killed. But than I thought that maybe it will be Roland who will get killed? In the end decided to simpy go into Nexus and push project alone and wait some time if anybody can come.</p><p><strong><em>BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!</em></strong> <strong>HIT! HIT!</strong> One humman died! Terrence was no more, and Derek was lucky in killing, so He could come and help with Nexus work. And got second spore ^^ Ufff.... No matter what I was thinking about Roland at that time - we both "celebrated" this small "victory" together, being happy that we can live.</p><p>Death of Terrence brought two possitive effect for me in paticular. Firstly from this moment Chun was acting much more carefull - which ment slower pace of hunting (but more precise). Secondly - as Terrence was one of our Technicans, I just got good reason why work on PILGRED bit more than to 40%. Less techs ment it is safer to get it higher, and harder to repair after Mushes dead. So I had reasons to not only work on it, but also to ask for relays when I wanted <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Oh! One more thing! Kuan Ti dedicated himself to Astro, so that made me actually our only <strong>dedicated Technican</strong>. Before that Terrence could come in and say "Raluca, give me bed! I am Tech, Pilot and RoboExpert! I need it more than You!" and I would have exacly ZERO argument against that. Well... Maybe one argument - I was most active crewmember and didn't even hiden that. Yes - inactivity don't help. High activity does! At least in my opinion. But that was not strong eoungh to keep bed if Terrence wanted. Luckily now Terrence could only want place in a coffin, and who am I to refuse? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Here I will add that from humman point of view, Chun's decision regarding Terrence was correct as far as I am concerned. But Roland should have been killed before that.</p><p>Unfortunatly Roland was not on time to give Derek third spore in Nexus. But insted He gave Stephen second spore and He infected Cat &gt;.&lt; TWO spores wasted! When He could turn Derek already. Gah!</p><p>But wait! That is not a problem actually. I will just wait till tommorow and I will finish Derek off... Right? RIGHT? Hehe... Nothing is that easy...</p><p><strong>Spore crisis and Project Mistake</strong></p><p>So... At begining of day I planed to extract one spore to be able to convert Derek completly WITHOUT Roland's help. I woken up at C1 from bed, and wanted to go and push PILGRED... And what?! I see that I can not extract any more spores... How?!</p><p>So what happened? You guessed it! Roland was faster. This is incredible for me - 4AP per spore extraction and He still could do it before I did! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Well... I just went back to bed angry at Him. How it would be wonderfull without Him! And how much better with cooperational partner? I could only dream...</p><p>Meanwhile Kuan Ti decided to put Him nose out of bridge - and believe me. This caused true terror for me. He went around whole ship, commented at Terrence's death (lectured Chun on Her job), checked Roland, PILGRED, NERON Projects... Litelary - that was an inspection! And I just waited WHEN He will ask "Raluca! Why are You missing health?!". Please KT! Please! Don't come into my dorm! Don't! Just do not come in!</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> entered the room <em>moments ago</em></p><p>F... No! No! NO! I bet He has Medkit! I bet He will heal me and than kill me! I have no excuse to be hurted that much. No! NO! NO!!!</p><p>At this moment I got <strong>Plan B</strong> which was - in case He discoveres, just kill Him. No Techs - hard time doing PILGRED. And oxygene was dropping down with every cycle... And Armor as well... Killing Kuan Ti at that moment would be winning move. Ship would loose all Techs (I would be killed shortly) and would also loose dedicated Astro. Frieda would have to pick up Astro role and there would be only Andie as a Pilot. Ship would be destroyed for sure. But that would be such BORING and STUPID way to finish it. I didn't wanted it. Kuan Ti! Please, do not have medkit...</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> left the room <em>moments ago</em></p><p>"Roland! Why are You dirty staying alone in Alpha Bay?" - good! He saw Roland but not me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I was so glad... Nothing out of ordinary with me... Move along! Move along... Nothing to see here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>"Raluca! Why do we work on Bigger Icarus Bay? Why did You mistaken it with Bay Doors XXL?!" - I am so dead!!!</p><p>Ok. I think I should explain to my humman crew this little incident. I already explained that on ship, so You know what caused that mistake of mine. But there is one more question now that You know I was Your Mush. Question is: Was it intentional "mistake"? Answer is - No. That was honest mistake. I honestly made mistake here, and was really surprised about that. Fortunatly - this didn't changed a thing. I believe that it is common mistake and that is why You guys understood me and decided to leave it be...</p><p>This was good! I made mistake and didn't had to pay for it. What a luck!</p><p>And it is long already so I will stop it, and will continue in next post... After some time, when I will feel like continuing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> It is tiring after all. One more note - I may be remembering things wrong, there may be incoscincense here and there. So feel free to point it out if You were on that ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Oh, I just love this so far. I'm playing this game for quite a while now and I know exactly how it sometimes feels to get tensed right before some ingenious nefarious plan is about to come to fruition with the accompanying fear of being discovered or to make one false move. And you are describing your thoughts in a way that makes the whole "story" really entertaining - and I was on this ship - it still is entertaining.</p><p>About not killing Roland - I think I wasn't quite active when the first suspicions about Roland began, so I might have missed some parts. The only real information that I got from Chun is something along the lines of "Kill him, he is dirty.". And Roland actually stated that he was "xmasing", meaning he was celebrating Christmas and holiday stuff as an explanation for him staying dirty in the bay that one time. While I didn't entirely believe it, I was also not very sure after I had to kill Terrence based on similar circumstances with the difference that Terrence didn't say anything at all. Derek is not a character I prefer usually playing, so my beginning thought on this ship was "Hopefully Chun is not inactive, then I won't have to do much thinking and just do what she says." - which was exactly what I did by killing Terrence when she asked. Yes, concerning Terrence's actions the decision was correct and her argument that one shouldn't hesitate was also true hence on many ships people died because of hesitation of the killing personnel, but nevertheless after Terrence was dead and human, I began to doubt her judgement and started my own thoughts. And Terrence was a pilot and didn't want the blood of a second innocent pilot on my hands - this is why I didn't kill him right away. I wanted to wait to see how the hunter/scrap collection situation develops and then judge whether or not Roland should be killed.</p><p>As of not to spoil Europa's story, I'm not going to say anything about Roland's fate at this point. I hope that with the continuous reveal of the story's development I will be able to elaborate on how the upcoming "whys" and "why nots" have looked from my point of view.</p>

                <p>Chun here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> , excellent story telling so far Raluca, however allow me to state some facts and correct some details :</p><p>1- This is my first time (maybe second) playing Chun so even if the Mush won on this ship I think it wasn't because of me, I did a great job with what I had on the ship especially the I was the only one working on research and taking care of plants until later stages of the trip. Also I'm not that experienced at Mush hunting so no AP counting was used during the ship.<br>2- The grenade and grenade blueprint incident you talked about was a little bit misunderstood, I thanked you for both those objects and took care of them (hid the grenade in one of the front turrets and placed the blueprint under camera) and I did that later than you expected both so that I can hide the path I took to hide the grenade in case you were Mush and also because I was more concerned by research which meant I preferred to spend more AP on them than going around the ship tp hide the objects, now here is the misunderstanding you had, right after you dropped them in medlab, I just mentioned that you should have taken the Babel Module that was there in the medlab and assembled it since Andie was going on expedition soon and needed it, I didn't ask you to bring it to me (I don't know why you though that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> )<br>3- As you explained, it was the right decision to eliminate Terrence right away even though it was gonna cost us a lot for the fact that he was inactive, woke up, took the cat and cuddled it (we were ok on morale so he had no reason to do that except spore it), then headed for the bridge, again with no reason to do so (sofa was already built), from the many ships I had in this game, I learned one essential rule, never ignore suspicious behavior and hesitate to punish it especially from people who don't communicate (many Mush players myself included prefer to communicate to the minimum so that they avoid exposing themselves by mistake and play the dump noob player who doesn't know much about the game)<br>4- I ignored your extinguishers request for the simple reason that again I was almost alone working on research and plants so I simply didn't have enough AP to go get one and hide it so I just prayed that we didn't have a pyro Mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>5- This will be my last remark until you post more so that I don't spoil the rest of your story, this is something you didn't know and your partner Derek failed to mention, he was the first to be added to my trusted list because he ate twice, now don't get me wrong, he didn't do it to prove himself, he did it so that he can execute my order and kill Terrence as fast as he can</p><p>I will post more as you go on in your story even though I already spoiled some of it in y death message, sorry about that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"></p>

I will prepare Mushroom Soup for Her... Umm... No, that is propably not good idea <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> She ate already eoungh of my mushrooms ^^ Consider this as my personal revange for that talk of Yours when You were saying that You will give grenade back to Mushes AFTER You will kill them all ^^ Nu Nu Nu! When You told that I felt one thing - allowing You kill me and return to Sol would be just humiliating for me. Since than it was not an option! Lesson for You - do not tease Mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Now... How about tea insted? With sugar and lemon? Will be ok? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I am glad to see You are here as well <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And I am glad to read things from Your point of view... Although You would be surprised how much info I managed to take out of Derek while He was still humman ^^ I think that our friend is not one that would be able to keep total secrecy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I will soon continue story of "Wise and Brave Ralulu Mush and Cowardly, Bad and Ugly Chunny The Chun" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> But first I should answer to Your message... Let's see...</p><p>1. I checked Your history... That was second time You were Chun, but Your first time was also Your very first time playing game, so I would not count it. So that makes it rather first time ^^ I hope that You liked it and had pleasure of hunting me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I have to tell You one thing - You were personal nightmare of mine for 4 days. I hope that I was Your's as well <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> As for responsibility for that outcome - firstly, it is very rare situation that only one person is at fault. This game is about team work, not alone work <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Secondly - I think that I am rather manipulative person.</p><p>Also the fact that there were no AP counting had nothing to do with finnal outcome <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> As I said - I used only 4 AP to do Mushy things, and drank 1 coffe. So at best somebody could notice me lacking 6 AP during 5 days. I would say it is kind of hard to notice ^^</p><p>So yes - You tried Your best <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I think that my personality helped me a lot. Patience in paticular was usefull ^^ And... That may be not modest out of me, but I think that final result is actually MY fault, rather than anybody's else <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>2. You made me feel stupid ^^ All right - so here it was totally misunderstooded <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Haha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Hmm... I had no idea that there was Babel Module at all! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I was surprised about it ^^ Haha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I must also tell that there was also another reason I wanted You to hid those grenades and grenade BP ^^ I wanted to make sure that Roland will not get any "bright" ideas about those items... I would kill Him for rampaging early I guess ^^ That would ruin my entire plan ^^ So... Thank You for hiding those things.</p><p>3. I hope that I showed You that being active and talkactive and RPing active is also good way to play as Mush. Even better, as it creates more interesting story <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>4. Hahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Your prayers has been granted ^^ Not that it brought good results though ^^ I had once Pyro Mush. What a great displeassure... What a primitivism &gt;.&lt; Totally worth to spend even up to 6 AP to make sure that tactick is countered <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Trust me on that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>5. Umm... I actually knew ^^ As I said - Derek is not ment to keep secrets... Even as humman ^^ And yes - I heard His reasons behind double eating as well ^^ And thanks to that He was able to help me in Nexus... ^^</p>

                <p>Now that I answered message of our important guesst (remember people - I was "Good Guy" and She was "Bad Guy", not otherwise!) I think we should go on with story... So... Where did I finished it? Hmmm... Ah! Yes! So... I made that mistake about projects and their properties. Luckily it was understood by crew. And that was honest mistake - not Mushy desinformation.</p><p><strong>Nexus Stagnation</strong></p><p>After it has been revealed by Kuan Ti that project we worked on was not what we thought it was, there was stagnation in Nexus. Kuan Ti wanted us to do diffrent project, rest of crew didn't seemed to care at all, I wanted to do SOMETHING to look more humman than I already did, and Derek wanted to continue current project. So it was a tie - I decided to play neutral here, claiming that all three projects are equaly weak (Large Icarus Bay, Piston Sensor and Aux Terminal). This situation lasted for long time and nobody was willing to do anything. So I stayed for two cycles with Derek in Nexus (I was going to Dorm with Janice on cycle changes to gain 2 AP and avoid morale loss... Haha <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">) And because of Roland I didn't had any spore to finish off Derek. Buuu Roland! Buuu! I wanted Him to come in right in that moment and finish it. I litelary spammed Mush Channel with messages asking Him to come in and spike Derek - no reaction). Apart form that I talked with Derek in our chat - there was me (Raluca) Derek and Janice ^^ This conversation comfirmed one thing - Derek is guy I wanted as Beta for sure! At least lvl 14 Mush. Or more? I don't know <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I was just glad from this situation <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> That Nexus Stagnation situation lasted for two cycles, after those two cycles I finished with Derek current project in hopes to get Plasma Shield as next one... TO BE CONTINUED.</p><p><em>Just little before that, in same time as "Nexus Stagnation" and after that...</em> <br><strong>Overal situation of our ship, and why RGN hated Mushes and disliked hummans.</strong></p><p>General situation of our ship was... It was strange I would say. Very unusual. Normaly it is that situation is good at begining and slowly goes worse and worse untill it forces return to Sol if Eden is not an option. Of course - sometimes it happens faster, and sometimes slower. It is diffrent for every ship. But THIS ship was unique! As I said - RGN hated Mushes. None of us was Alpha Mush before, Roland was newbie in general, I got accidental hurt by taking shower on top of normal damage that Mush is getting... However I felt kind of secured in a way that I could alwasy simply kill Kuan Ti together with Roland. No more Techs, ment hard work with PILGRED.... Bah! What am I talking about! Kuan Ti was phillar of humman tean when it came to role filling! He took Astro and Tech, but was mainly astro. So Frieda could be Pilot (but She also could take Astro on any time when needed). Because Frieda was Pilot, Andie could concentrate more on research than on piloting. Now imagine - Kuan Ti suddenly disapears... Whole construction is destroyed! Right? So that is why I felt kind of secured. All that was necessary to crumble that system was to eliminate Kuan Ti...</p><p>RGN hated Mush! Paola managed to print Mage Books... Gues what two skills those had? Yep! <strong><em>Astro</em></strong> and <strong>Tech</strong>. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I can only imagine ONE worse scenario! <strong>Medic</strong> and <strong>Tech</strong> - than Chun would finish MycoScaner surely and Derek would discover my little secret. Still... Fact that there were Tech and Astro Books on bridge ment simply that Kuan Ti was no longer lone philar of ship's system. Now ANYBODY could become dedicated Astro or Tech. So Frieda would stil be pilot, and Andie still would be researcher. In matter of one second my feeling of security collapsed. Now there was nothing I could do in order to doom ship in case of getting discovered. Worse! In the mean time MycoAlarms were finished and Chun started to ask about Anti-Grav Scooter. Good I didn't had it than, as I can feel that one of those would land in Nexus... I have litelary NO IDEA where those were delivered and what happened about them at all... <em>Chun! Please, tell!!!</em> Anyway - my point is that it was first time that I felt really cornered. I knew that I have very little time to finish Derek Conversion, and that I can not count on my partner... And that He may steal again my spores on very next day <em>(Last Christmass I gave you my spores! But the very next day - You stole them again!)</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> I started to have many ideas on what to do, and I kind of panicked. Somewhere in this time Roland out of sudden proposed that He may take some important items and run away in Parshipae... <strong><em>My reaction? I gave Him "nice" pep talk for even suggesting resorting to such strategy. I turned down His offer and suggested other plan (which He ignored without even answering simple "No", like he had in His custom)</em></strong> I had idea that He will come into dorm with me, will take off camera and spike Derek (turning Him Mush), and than I wanted Him to kick me off bed and hit few times so I would look more humman and I could get some healing from Chun ^^. Later I decided that this plan was actually dump, and made diffrent one. And again. And again... And againnnnn.... Untill that whole "Nexus Stagnation" happened I was creating more and more "exotic" plans. Each more complicated than previous... And I turned them down all. "Nexus Stagnation" gave end to it as it created possibility to infect Derek with Roland's help - logs showed no Chun entering Nexus after all... But that is another story.</p><p>I did told that this ship was unique in how situation was developing... As I said - RGN hated Mush... But it also disliked hummans <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> How come? Tech and Astro Books... One totally useless mush... ^^ Well... How about that - armor was safe at around 60+%. Suddenly came wave of hunters! 18 of them? Something like that... Not a problem for 3 pilots (Andie, Frieda and Roland), right? Sorry! One pilot is Mush. So no help here. Frieda was offline and Andie... Andie in Lab ^^ But not a problem! Some of them will miss... Others will deal little damage. Right? So here comes cycle change... Here it comes... I bet we will loose 20 armor... Maybe 25, but not more. <strong>BOOOM!!!</strong> 25 Armor <strong><em>left!!!</em></strong> WHAT?! Even I was surprised at that. I bet that EVERY SINGLE HUNTER managed to hit with maximum strenght... That was truly deadly! I mean... Imagine - this ship's situation changed from "Good" to "Critical" in matter of ONE cycle change! ONE! Suddenly many things become unimportant. Oxygene was going down? - not important anymore as we are almost dead because of hunters. That was first time I saw something like that. So... RGN hated Mushes... Done us many bad things, and many good things for hummans... But this one "trick" was easily worth many done to us. No Plasma Shield and no Armored Corridors... I think that we all believed back than that we will simply explode in space...</p><p>And we would! But that was not an ending I wanted to see... Did I mentioned that oxygene was slowly hitting magical level of 8 units? I think it was around 11 - 9 units back than...</p><p><strong>Nexus Stagnation - Part 2</strong></p><p>So... I finished with Derek that project in Nexus, and since we had only about 25 hull, 11-9 oxygene and plenty of hunters shooting at us, What were our next projects? I don't remember all of them. I remember only one out of those - PLASMA SHIELDS! We pushed it really hard with Derek - up to 48% in one go. <strong><em>Little I knew that this act of pro-humman activity saved my life. Derek was almost sure that I am Mush because I always asked </em>Him<em> to work with me in Nexus.</em></strong> As I later learned from Him - He was close to killing me (suggesting Chun to kill me) but THIS deed made Him wonder again... "All She needed to do in order to win was NOT work on Plasma Shileds". Yes - I could littelary lie down and wait my victory. Insted I was doing everything to set Plasma Shields up. Derek lowered His guard... Not completly, but eoungh to allow me conversion later on...</p><p><strong>IN NEXT EPISODE!</strong><br><strong>Will Derek find out truth about Ralulu?<br>Predator Chun ATTACK! Does She hit right this time?<br>HELP! Nexus trapped!</strong></p><p>See You next time ^^ Which means today, but later on ^^</p>

                <p>Ehh... And You still forget to use capital leters <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But You are right! I had lot's of fun, and I am having now lot's of fun by writing about fun I had. And as long as people like my writing, I am willing to do so <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Honestly... I do regret that I didn't done NRJ diary for this one... Would be perfect <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><br><p><strong>Out of nowhere! Predator Chun ATTACK! Who dies this time?</strong></p><p>So... Derek and I made Plasma Shields ut to 48% in one go, which also caused Derek to have doupts about me being Mush. That was true life saver for me, even if I hadn't knew about that. Well... But in the end both - Derek and I had to go back into Dorm to get more AP. So there was litelary NOTHING of value from my actions untill very next day. But when I ended my day, somebody else started His... First of all - Frieda came online and took care of some of those hunters. She even offered to use Her patroller in order to draw some enemy fire and sacrafice Herself. I was first to discourage Her from this kind of action. I didn't wanted Her to die that way... There were plans to make and turn in motion... And Frieda had very nice place in my plans ^^ Secondly somebody put fuel so Jin Su could move ship and get us out of hunters (still some followed). Somewhere in all this Roland went shooting Hunters, and was shooting so good that shoot down only 1 of them (I have no idea if He extracted spores, or simply forgot to check His target - never mind that. Outcome was same. And lastly we had Chun... Our true antagonist! She decided to check on Roland via Medkit (Chun.... Chunny my dear... If You only would check on me back than... ^^). You don't know it, but when you made heal on Roland, He was online <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> He spoke to me in our Chat... He was SO HAPPY that You healed Him... I bet that He was thinkng how clever He was and fooled You out ^^ I was so nice to not tell Him what that actually ment. Insted of that I simply allowed Him believe that You healed Him out of good heart <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> What happened next? That was obvious for me. One or two cycles later (or maybe 3 or 4?) whole ship gets message that Roland has been assasinated, and Chun happily announces that this time She was right. I decided to check if anybody is there from TE by asking about Delzoup. Seems like I was only one <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Anyway - Chun deserved my congratulations and ethernal greatfullnes for getting rid of that... Parasite! ^^ Who knows? Maybe it was reason why I managed to extract spores next day? Anyway - Roland was dead, and I was alone. In this moment every sane, normal Mush should be sad about His partner. But I am anything byt normal - I was sooooo glad. Parasite is dead! Parasite is dead! Parasite is dead! Parasi... Wait a minute... Roland is dead? Yea... Dead... Ship is critical condition... But if They would kill Me... Kuan Ti is Tech, and anybody can read Tech book... No more Mushes... ROLAND! PLEASE! DON'T BE DEAD! IF I DIE THEY WILL SIMPLY RETURN SOL!!! I need more time... To make sure all will go well. Than You can die, but not before! How could You leave me in only moment I needed You? I mean... Only thing I needed You to do is to stay alive. And even this You failed... &gt;.&lt; Damn You! Wait Derek! Just wait and don't You dare run away! You will be mine! You will be!</p><p><strong>"Winter is commng..."</strong></p><p>So... That was situation. Ship was critical, but in case of Mush Elimination crew could still rush PILGRED and make it to Sol with Kuan Ti and Tech (Mage Book damn it!). Derek was spored twice already, and we had some hunters still left shooting at us (but not many - 8? Maybe even just 4...) and slowly take away bits of ship's hull. Roland was dead, which on one hand made me sure to get spores on day change, but on other hand it was obvious that in case of my death Mush will be no longer present on ship, and hummans will get possibility to run with their lives. In short - I needed to extract spore and infect Derek. And it had to be done fast, as MycoAlarms were ready and only waited for Chun to deliver them into rooms! After day change I went work on PILGRED as I had two PILGRED points. Of course I also got dirty from extracting free spore (Fertile). Than I went shower myself and than... SURPRISE! SURPRISE! Do You remember how Ian got dirty from taking care of plants? You know... He forgot an apron back than? At end of C8 He did <em>EXACLY SAME THING!!!</em> Chun was mad... Derek lost His patience! I got direct message from Him - "I am going kill Ian. I will need every AP I can get". Ehh... That complicated things a lot. I could go and push it once and come back to Dorm... That would be right thing to do if I would have unlimited time. But time was limited. MAlarms were done after all... And Armor was dimnishing with every passed cycle... So I had to risk convincing Him to help with Plasma Shields. I was argumenting that Ian can wait, as He can not kill anybody... He is harmless... No point killing Mush if we will blow up - better to save ship and than kill Ian... And Derek said suddenly something that almost made me infecting Him under cameras in the open... "Why can not Janice help You? Why it has to be always me?!". My only answer was "Janice is not active now, and You are."</p><p>Well... It didn't worked too well, and I agreed with myself that I lost this paticular battle, and have to wait till better occasion will be present. I just walked resigned into Nexus, and what I saw? ROLAND was there just before He got killed by Chun! And I got immidietly an idea!</p><p><em>Value of my character</em> was very big at that moment. I was olny dedicated Tech (Kuan Ti was mainly Astro), and I was only Physicist. That ment only I can finish PS quickly. So it is natural that crew will want to protect me, maybe even play fools in order to cure me if they would found out... In short - at that very moment I was MOST valuable team member, apart from maybe Frieda, who as dedicated Pilot was on par with me! So I could allow myself luxury of making others risk their skin for me... I tried one more argument to lure Derek into Nexus...</p><p>"Fuck! Roland was here! Nexus is propably trapped! If You can not help me with Plasma Shields, than at least come and "disarm" potential trap so I don't risk being turned." (important - I was talking with Derek a lot, and He remembered very good that Roland came into Engine Room, so there was risk that I was already spored once or twice).</p><p>Than it was silend... And I was wondering if Derek will come or not. Or maybe He will see through me? THAT WAS LONGEST SILENCE ON THIS SHIP FOR ME!!! Waiting... Tension... Refreshing every 10 seconds... And suddenly...</p><p><strong>Derek</strong> entered the room <em>moments ago</em></p><p>My hands were shaking, but I tried as quick as possible! Klicked on Derek -&gt; Infect -&gt; Mush Skills -&gt; Anonymush!</p><p>WORKING! IT WORKED! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Derek was now Mush! MUSH! An Active one! Competent! Cooperative! Finnaly I had good Mush Partner! And comfirmed humman that had acces to Chun's Secret Channel!!! Thank You Roland for coming into Nexus. At least in that way You were usefull... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>And this is how winter came on board of Daedalus... While crew didn't knew about it yet, that was begining of their true doom. Soon... <strong>Very soon that winter that came, so hidden inside autumn's shadow, will steep into open and all inhabitants of Daedalus will feel <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HwtmYh9e8A">Rage of the Winter</a>!!!</strong></em></p><p>Uhh... Late ^^ Next Episode tommorow! ^^ All story is based on facts! But not free of mistakes and forgetfullnes. If You were on this ship - feel free to add things, explain and present Your point of view like Derek and Chun did few times already <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Roland seemed to be immortal player because of being gold and having important job, while Terrence does mushy stuff as human, attracts much suspicion "doing something" and gets killed. But you made a great job as first time Alpha Mush. You were nored being human and you liked to be at least Beta, but now I see you're lethal.

                <p>No, I wouldn't kill them, but if they got suspicion, I wouldn't defens them. I kill Mush if I'm sure they are Mush. I wouldn't go to relay projects or PILGRED with you without MycoAlarm, it isn't my style. So far I've killed 10 agents of Mush and they were detected by me, I sometimes find somebody to help but it's usually difficult, so knife enough and done. I've killed 3 innocents. First one was a suspect when ship was doomed. Then I learned that I shouldn't kill if I'm not sure. Second time a griefer held Mush Sample in the Lab. Someone told it was part of Mush Tutorial. People tried to kill him, I finished. Then I learned to never kill newbies because they always look mushy even if they're human. They both were on my first ships. However, the third time was when we had proven Mush and I ordered somebody to kill the shrink before day change. He delayed, day change happened, we had Beta Mush. It was between 2 people. The first didn't report any visits, but the second one looked experienced, just stayed in un-protected area and was suspicious of catching bobby-trap. I killed him, but he was human, that person was Mush.</p>

                <p>Patryk... This is social game - going solo sooner or later will bite You in Your ass, just as I got bitten on my "Full Mush" ship. You should pay more attention on social aspect, and less on math behind everything. Really. And saying how You are great at hunting Mushes and how others are lucky You were not on their ship <em>(soon You will make me belief that people ARE lucky when you are NOT on their ship, if You will try bit more of this)</em> because than they would surely not succeded, looks just You are being full of Yourself. Moreover, what You just said was also insulting to me, Derek, Chun... Everybody who DID good work on that ship - You are automatically saying "I am better than any of You were!" to them, and You just said to me "You lack of skills/intellect to win on ship with me!" <strong>even if that is not what You want to say!</strong> (and I do know You eoungh to know that it is the case here). And even if that is truth what You said - even if You are best mushhunter ever, that can singlehandedly take on any amount of Mushes of diffrent kind and style of playing. Even if You are a God of Mushhunting - even than saying certan things is simply not a proper thing to do. Remember Patryk - words are not numbers. Sentence is not mathematical calculation with only one true answer and interpretation. What we are saying have more meanings than we can realise. Just look at how I poorly understood Chun on my ship... I can only imagine that when reading what I wrote She was in some way feeling bad about this and about my description of Her (which was caused by the fact that back than on ship I did felt bad about Her words - which was due to misunderstandings and not something intentional). I also feel that my words about You killing people left and right were as well rather sad, or at least unfair for You, judging from Your answer Patryk. If so - I am sorry, didn't mean it.</p><p>I honestly hope that You do understand what I just pointed You out. I hope even more that, what I said does makes any sense... Because if not that I think I should go to psyhiatrist <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p><strong>Calm before Storm...</strong></p><p>So it looked really good now for Mush Team. Ship was slowly fading into it's own destruction, oxygene was also low, armor was droping as well... And there were two Mushes on board... Derek (Silver Wrestler and Shooter/ No Mush skills Yet) and I - our Noble Protagonist Ralulu (Silver Phys and Tech/Fertile and Anonymush). At that point it was again safe for Mushes to assume victory. In worst case scenario Derek could always read Tech Book and we both could kill Kuan Ti. Problem of PILGRED solved! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> But that was not proper way to do stuff. Actually we both really wanted to get to Sol, and were planing originaly to keep ship alive and help hummans as much as we could. This of course ment two major problems.</p><p>Firstly - hummans new that there were still Mushes alive on ship, so no way they would just return to Sol, and none of us knew where Hacker Kit is (AFAIK). At least I had no idea. I wasn't even interested honestly, as I never wanted to RETURN ship to Sol. I wanted (and Derek as well) to get to Sol with hummans believeing there is no more Mushes on board. But comrades bar was merciless!</p><p>Roland however managed to put (waste) two spores into Stephen - inactive in Refectory. So Derek, who was in Chun's trusted channel started puting gentle mentions about secondary Mush being inactive Stephe or Hua. Only thing that there was needed, was to put finnal spore into Him and wait untill He will die out of room shakes/metal plates etc. Derek would took Anonymush and all would be nice and secret...</p><p>Exept there was second problem - Eleesha was active. Maybe not VERY active, but still active and alive. And She didn't printed THE LIST, so She would knew that there is another Mush on board after Stephen's death... But we let this problem to be left for now - who knows? Maybe steel plate will kill Her? Maybe She will give Derek reason to kill Her under Mush suspicions? We left this problem alone and concentrated on hiding Derek as Mush.</p><p>Of course nothing is ever easy, right? Derek needed to extract spore before He would be able to spike Stephen, and there was litelary no reason for Him to get dirty. At least no reason that would make any sense for others... And here is when I came to help! I posted in discusion that I need relay on PILGRED and that somebody needs to put one fuel so we can get out of orbit. Both jobs were able to make Derek dirty. After that - I went sleep. Honestly I had no idea if I will be alive next day, or will I be dead together with Daedalus. But as it happened - Frieda did good work on hunters and our ship was still alive (12 Armor left).</p><p>Unfortunatly Chun closed PILGRED option for Derek by saying "Concentrate on Plasma Shield now, not on PILGRED" which was absolutly right thing to do. I only replied that I want that relay as I will soon have two PILGRED points, and would hate to waste them - I hoped that this was resonable answer, as working on PILGRED with AP in that situation would look just... Mushy? ^^</p><p>But fuel was not loaded, so Derek used that reason to get dirty, extract spore (no Fertile - 4AP down the rain) and took shower. Derek needed now rest and regain lost AP... But He had spore for Stephen.</p><p>In the mean time Chun asked Derek to read Tech book, so He can help me with Plasma Shield. Because we wanted to get Sol as two Anonymushes, I started to work again on Plasma Shield, but LITELARY nobody gave me relay. Derek could not as than anybody could count His AP. But nobody else helped me... Too bad, as I could have finish it, or nearly finish it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Now... Remember that RGN hated Mush? Even when somebody does hate You, still will grant occasional presents to You <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Eleesha out of sudden (propably desperational attempt to get rid of Mushes) printed THE LIST... And Roland was there!!! Hahahahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></strong> Return to Sol as two Anonymushes was becoming more possible... But state of ship was too bad already... I spend one cycle change in Nexus (this time with camera, as in mean time Gioele came online and put cameras in Lab and Nexus) waiting for any help from hummans on Plasma Shields. During cycle change we got hit by few hunters and our Hull dropped down to 5 points!!! It was obvious that next cycle change will mean death for us...</p><p>Also seeing how nobody was even trying to help on PS, Derek and I lost faith that this ship can make it to Sol, even if we would suddenly both be inocullated. So plan was changed - we decided that it will be good to add some chaos to ship and make it interesting ^^ But in order to acomplish something, ship must not die that fast. So what Mush Ralulu did? Haha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I took wrench, and repaired Hull to 15 points. Frieda with Andie managed take care of all hunters, and by doing so - we both ensured that Daedalus will survive long eoungh to be captured ^^ Thank You for Your hard work <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But let's back on topick, shall we? Derek and I stop believing that this ship is ment to came back to Sol ever. So we wanted to put more chaos into it ^^</p><p><strong>Mush Plan - Operation Chaos MK1</strong></p><p>First plan that we made, ment that Derek will take Radio Pirate and will pirate Chun's Talkie, than will make somebody else look guilty assasinating Her, and we will watch how hummans murder that innocent person. In the mean time, Derek would kill Chun, Kuan Ti and Andie. I on other hand would make sure that Oxy Tanks will get sabotaged (we were already at 3 oxygene, but there were only two cycles to day change, no which we would get another 3 oxygene). That would spread chaos among hummans and would started killing everybody on ship quickly.</p><p>To execute this plan, Derek needed to get back AP from extraction. So time of execution was at C1 - just after daychange <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I also needed some AP after I fixed hull... Luckyli Jin Su send me mission to work on Plasma Shields, so I was able to regain that AP quicker <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Mush Plan - Operation Chaos MK2</strong></p><p>Actually... Why destroy Oxy Tanks, when I can just take oxygene for myself and Derek can do the same? Hmm? So that was changed. But that was minor change. There was other, bigger change.</p><p>Let's see... I am Fertile, so I get one spore per day for free... And I got dirty from repairing hull and extracted said spore, just in case it could be usefull. So... Derek had also spore. And after day change I would be able to extract another free spore...</p><p>Moreover - Derek could spike somebody, I could spike somebody, and on another day I could again spike somebody... So we could make another Mush!</p><p>Decision was made in instand! <strong><em>Frieda! You will be my second Beta Mush!!!</em></strong> So plan was adjusted to that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> We didn't had to worry about making it in secred - we would do it under cameras. I would extract spore right in front of Her. Why? Because in my dorm there was only Raluca (me), Frieda (my victim), Hua (inactive) and Janice (was starving from some time, and didn't gave any sight of life since that time - propably soon to become inactive I thought). So what to worry? Frieda will not sell me out after She will be one of us <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And with Chun, Andie and Kuan Ti death it will be easy to do what we want with ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Maybe we could even push PILGRED hard, and make it Sol? ^^</p><p>As time was closing near I started to get nervous... Will it work? I hoped so! Derek prepared Himself by picking Radio Pirate and Ninja... We waited... Operation was planned to start 1 minute before cycle/day change by me spiking Frieda right under cameras <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><strong>And I will stop it here for now <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Will tell You more later when I will be ready to do so!</strong></p>

                <p>Yeah, Europa, it's social game. I still remember one game when "everything was on plate". It was casting, I woke up and Mush dead, all project done in less than week, first time seen all research done, oxygen and fuel near max, armor good, Gioele goes to collect scrap and we had 30 pieces of scrap metal. We had everything except Water Stick, anyway we gave up when Chun burned to death and reached Eden.<br>I know what social game is. But it doesn't mean that I'll relay with somebody in unprotected area. I understand roleplay and gameplay, I don't tell people that I'm the best or something. I shared thoughts with you about these players, but haughtiness... When I see somebody playing poorly, I give some advice, but I don't tell "I'm the best Mush hunter! Mush, you'll die in 2 days, I promise!" There are many things I tell and people don't understand, yeah. It's sometimes difficult for me to prove. I see you've got interesting way to make voyage interesting, as I have the way to use maths into game, if I was the best, I wouldn't be jealous of you, I sometimes miss playing with you. I still count that voyage with you the most interesting.<br>And I told "fail or boring voyages", I didn't mean "each my voyage is boring" and "each my voyage is fail", but I usually get ship which gets destroyed quickly or boring ship, I mean Mush killed, but they made rampage, Eden impossible, we must go to Sol, no challenge since Mush dead, just focus on PILGRED and home. Uou may find my text exaggerating (because they were some successful and interesting voyages), as I find so much in your answer. I'm trying to write and understand precisely, but I sometimes make mistakes and something goes wrong. If it's a significant mistake, I had bad thoughts in nightmares at nights (yeah, I'm a bit addicted to this game). Some of my decisions lead to defeat, it happens.<br>Now, don't disturb me, I'm reading your lecture. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Well here I am again, let's take off right were we left in the last episode but this time I will tell the story from my perspective rather than comment on Europa's Story.</p><p>Let me first resume the current situation : Terrence is dead by my mistake so Derek and everyone else lost or are loosing trust in my judgment because of that, the activity on the ship is pretty low (half the people are either inactives or connect once a day in separate intervals), the ship is taking heavy damage as if no Pilots are present to defend it, our O2 level is decreasing rapidly with no plans to correct that, projects are advancing well research on the other hand are advancing slower than they should be and Mush has been eliminated yet.</p><p><strong>Contingency Plan</strong></p><p>With the current situation getting worse every cycle and with the knowledge that the Mush can act on it at any moment I had to try and contain the situation the best I can with what I have so I decided to prioritize what needed to be done. First get more people in the Mush hunt channel which at the time had only me and Derek my favorite solider <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> , how to do that? simple we have a planet that needs exploring and contains insects and swamps which means at least one the poor participants is for sure gonna get sick.Bingo, Andie and Jin Su went and Jin Su came back sick (I healed him myself to be sure). This guaranteed that with the haker kit secured by me, no one will be abandoned during an expedition, now we only need Kuan Ti to find us an O2 planet and problem solved.</p><p><strong>Lab Time</strong><br>Next was research, at the time we only managed to complete the Gas and Serum, so for the future expeditions and other critical parts of the ship, we needed the Alarms that's why I urged Andie to concentrate on doing research with me to rush that (unfortunately it was finished too late as you figured out from Raluca's story), once done I told him to secure the medlab with one alarm and let me take care of the rest as we were not finished with research yet (I needed to know who was infected so far especially after Roland's suspicious actions)</p><p><strong>Mush Hunt</strong><br>Now this is where I had to make the difficult choice, at the time, I had my suspicions manly on 4 people :<br>Roland (for the reasons Raluca mentioned and also because I managed to heal him when he never mentioned being injured) as my main suspect <br>Stephen (inactive or pretending to be in refectory) as my passive suspect<br>Ian (he became dirty multiple times even though his skills suggests he is not a noob) as my costs-too-much-to-deal-with-right-now suspect</p><p><strong>Lucky Decision</strong><br>With this at mind I was facing 13 Hunters attacking us while we are still in orbit after the successful expedition done by Jin Su and Andie (unfortunately we only got food from it) and the absence of our commander to move the ship, I had to do it myself since only I knew where the hacker kit was hidden, the problem was that since I played a few times as Jin Su and learned instinctively to always count all members present on the minimap before moving the ship, I noticed that someone was missing which meant one of our valued Pilots was out there so I can't move the ship yet, so my plan was to get the hacker kit which which was hidden in one of the front turrets and stay in the bridge waiting for the Pilot to land as no one was foolish enough to stay out with that many Hunters around.<br>Guess who was outside <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> , it was none other than our beloved main suspect Roland, this meant I had two choices that I needed to choose from fast before he lands :</p><p>Option 1: Move the ship and kill Roland at no cost but risk being wrong again and further shrinking our Pilots number<br>Option 2: Wait for him to land and risk him doing more suspicious work<br>I decided to follow my golden rule : In this game when you know that something is wrong and no explanation has been made go for the kill so I went with Option 1, you can imagine my face when the upper bar showed one less Mush scum (no offense Raluca <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> ) to deal with, little did I know that this actually helped the Mush more than if I didn't <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>From Bad To Worse</strong><br>From this point forth things got pretty bad due to inactivity (ship hull below 15, O2 below 1 day), I even prevented Derek from killing Stephen (our second suspect) as we could maybe trade him for some O2 or even Pilgred if things reached the worst, at this time I tried to stick to the plan and finish the MycoScan to at least figure out who our last Mush was while trying to get as much O2 from plants I could since I didn't trust Ian to take care of them (our last suspect). The situation was really hopeless at this point.</p><p><strong>One Last Beacon Of Hope</strong><br>There I was waiting for the ship to explode in the next few cycles as the hull was being damaged little by little until Raluca announces that we have the <em>Plasma Shield</em> project. This was the first good news I have heard since the beginning of the ship, this was our last hope of surviving. I completely abandoned any effort to find the last Mush and urged everyone to help Raluca (our MVP right now) to finish this project ASAP or we are doomed.<br>Everything seemed to go well inside a difficult situation, everyone who can was working on the Plasma Shield, Kuan Ti was trying to find us an O2 planet, Paola was waiting for a good deal to trade Stephen for O2 or Pilgred, we even had Gioele woken up from his inactivity since the start of the game.</p><p><strong>Surprise Nasty Surprise</strong><br>I went to sleep that night happy that at last everything was going according to plans only to wake up the next day dead <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> . I mean I knew I was gonna die in any cycle but I didn't expect it to come from a fellow crew member at this crisis time. <br>Here is what I noticed from my death screen, Raluca entered and started attacking me, then Derek entered and hacked my talkie, the log then kept saying that someone is attacking me but it was obvious that Derek was doing it after taking the Ninja Mush skill. So with my Talkie hacked you can imagine what chaos happened <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I will let my dear Raluca finish the story from here forth but before that let me congratulate you on your exceptional skill as a Mush during this ship, you were ruthless <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>I will have my revenge someday <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Now that you mention you death, Chun. I realized later that I made two mistakes. One was that I wanted to try out Ninja as Derek for once since it seemed very powerful combined with his Wrestler skill. The description says that the action is apparently anonymous. When killing you, I realized that they aren't anonymous at all. I assumed that "anonymous" meant something like "private" like when you are showering, but no, instead, everything is perfectly visible and the only thing that it does is that it says that "Someone" is attacking instead of displaying the name which, in that situation, was indeed obvious as you pointed out. (Also I shot at you which is not anonymous at all, but hey, I had free shooter points)</p><p>The second mistake was actually the consequence of the first mistake - without ninja, I would have had one free slot left, where I could have taken Mycellium Spirit at a later point, but I'm not going to say why it would have been important - Raluca will come to this.</p><p>But, well, for me it was kind of a yolo ship overall, so I agree, most of my decisions weren't very smart. Maybe I was affected by my own Derek role-play that I was trying to delve into. But well, I was a very useful tool (for both sides) - that's what Derek is after all.</p>

                <p>Europa, I don't understand this:<br>Firstly, you say that Roland got assassinated, then Roland is in Nexus when you were about to convert Derek. Could you explain this?

Not me! You can even see at ending page in my "history" that I hit many people, but not You my dear Chunny The Chun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I actually avoided You like fire <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>All right - now, let's move foward with story. It comes to an end, but what an EPIC end it will be! You will see... There will be new 3 characters who out of sudden will become very important for our story, while so far there were secondary characters AT BEST! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But...</p><p>So... As You remember, and as Chunny The Chun said - situation for hummans started to look much better than it was cycle before. Plasma Shield was being worked on, some inactives suddenly returned and become active, and Kuan Ti started to look for oxygene rich planet. Also one Mush was killed (thank You Chun by telling me how You killed Him! Never knew that! Was thinking You used knife or something like that - looks like I was wrong!). Truth was that I and Derek were both Mushes, and stage was set... 1 minute before day change Derek kills Chun while pirating Her channel and reporting that Eleesha is Mush, while I spike Frieda, so in next cycle we both spike Her once and turn into one of us...</p><p><strong>Black Tower beats Whilte Queen</strong> <em>One minute to Day change</em></p><p>Time was comming near... I was refreashing page each 5 seconds to see how things goes... But this is story of Derek (Black Tower on my chessboard) from my perspective. Just before time come I had to contact Him and send Him important message - what message was it? You will learn later. This one is about Him, not my messages (even if they did involved Him).</p><p>At some point I refresh page and what I do see? Something like this:</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Attention everybody! Eleesha is our second Mush. Please, kill Her as soon as possible! She attacked me!</span></span></p><p>Derek answered under this message with ensurance that Eleesha will be killed. Soon after that (still before Day Change) we get message that looked like this:</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Death registered <strong>Chun</strong>, cause: <em>assasination</em></span></span></p><p>If somebody would check logs of Shower Dorm, than He would noticed that it was Derek who killed Chun (He had ninja, but was alone with Her so no brainer who did that, and He used blaster as well...), but who will do investigations when Chun announce in open who is Mush and who is attacking Her? Nobody will think about Radio Pirate in time like that. Only thing that RGN hated Mush... So Derek missed many, many times and was not able to off Andie and Kuan Ti, as He was short on AP.</p><p>Good work Derek! Never would though that Radio Pirate can be such nice and interesting tool!</p><br><p><strong>White Bishop runs away His fate...</strong></p><p>Do You remember that I had message for Derek just before He killed Chun? Ehh... That was not good message unfortunatly. You see... I already spiked Derek this day, so I simply could not do this again with Frieda. Turning Her into one of us would require Derek taking Fertile, than spkining Her before cycle change, and than both of us spiking Her after day change (without Fertile for Derek that was still possible, but would cost 4 AP -Chun could survive than...). So I made great mistake in calculations, and I was inable to get Frieda. Our plan needed to procced without Her. I was worried that She might kill me just right away after what I was planning to do. Guess I was lucky that She was such competent Pilot ^^</p><p>Cycle has changed, hunters has comme and Frieda in instant jumped out of bed and into Patroller to shot them down. Than She read Chun's message and went to secure Parshipae so Eleesha will be unable to run away with it. <strong>It is not clear to me what has happened there, so I am just guessing!</strong> Frieda was too late - Parshipae was gone, and She told in main disscusion something like that:<br><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Great! Now Eleesha escaped with Parshipae!</span></span></p><p>There was only two problems - firstly, Eleesha was not a pilot to run away in Parshipae. Secondly - Eleesha was not a Mush to do such things. Still Frieda was competent humman pilot, and if She said there was no Parshipae that ment exacly that - there was no parshipae... Oh well... Never mind that - good that Eleesha is believed to be Mush. I just wondered how it was possible for Her to run away without Pilot skill (since I believed that indeed SHE run away in Parshipae <strong>at begining!</strong>).</p><p>But that battle was lost - Frieda remained humman. White Bishop was still white...</p><p><strong>Black Queen beats White Tower</strong></p><p>Now there was no Frieda in my Dorm. Only inactive Hua, currently AFK Janice and I. Guess what? One person too much, and I saw Janice getting damage from starvation for some time. So I fugured out that it would be nice to get rid of Her so hummans will not have any source of morale. Well... No knife, no blaster... Time to show how good I am at boxing!</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Death registered <strong>Janice</strong>, cause <em>assasination</em></span></span></p><p>To my surprise - nobody even commented on that for time being. It was for some time (one hour?) like there was never ever any Janice around. No mention about her at all! Well, one important humman down, Chaos was spreading across whole ship... How about converting Stephen who was idle in Refectory all this time? He still has two spores, and I am fertile... And I still have one spore! Yes! That is totally what I want to do! I took scooter and went into Rear Corridor... WHAT?!</p><p><em>Stephen entered room moments ago</em></p><p>And now this Parshipae thing started to make sense... So it was Stephen who took it, not Eleesha, but in all this chaos Frieda thought it was indeed Eleesha! But how Stephen would do this without pilot... APPRIENTICE!!! Of course! He surely apprienticed pilot from Frieda or Andie and run away with Parshipae! At begining of game He did coocked many rations and Derek had to freeze them back because of Him. Now He is running away in Parshipae... Griefer!!! Surely griefer! I looked for Him a bit in more crowded rooms, and after that I reported Him <em>(I already talked to one of Mods if I did good - Moderator comfirmed that I was in a right to report Him)</em>.</p><p>But there was also one problem... Stephen was lvl 1 player ^^ So no apprientice. Too bad I learned about that at very end of ship... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway - with no clear assasination/conversion target, and after killing Janice I decided that it will be best to hide behind Ian and hope for best. But before that... Just look! Only 3 oxygene in tanks! It would be horrible if somebody would take one away... Don't You agree? Well... I decided that it inndeed would be horrible and took that one oxy capsule with me into Lab <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Black Queen vs White Bishop - propaganda war!</strong></p><p>GUESS WHO WAS IN A LAB?! Ian of course! But apart of Ian? ELEESHA! Hahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Splendind! What could I do if not this:<br><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Eleesha, our Mush is in Labolatory! Hiding behind Ian! Please, come and kill Her ASAP! Frieda is lying! She is NOT in parshipae! Frieda is propably also a Mush!!!</span></span></p><p>Response came quickly:</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"></span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Raluca killed Janice in Alpha Dorm! Raluca is propably our Mush! Raluca, explain Yourself!</span></span></p><p>Now... What had I do in that situation? There was very good and resonable reason I could kill Janice if I would be humman, and I could give that reasoning. There was only one problem - I got this idea only after I went to sleep in real, so I had to fight that "propaganda war" without any good and resonable arguments. So how to fight such battle? I knew only one way of doing so - lie, lie and once more time lie!</p><p>Frieda posted nice logs from Alpha Dorm? I coppied them and posted back changed with my comment "I also know how to modify logs!" Frieda was pointing out that people can come and see themself logs in Dorm? I pointed on fact that She tried to protect Eleesha's real location by claiming that She was in Parshipae. Derek joined in by turning all that disscusion into some kind of parody... It was funniest part of that ship in my opinion. And in all that crossfire betwen me and Frieda, I had one more advantage... Very nice advantage...</p><p><strong>My secred advantage...</strong></p><p>If You are mush hunter - which chat would You like to get to see? That is right! Mush Chat! If You are Mush, You would love to see Chun's Private chat with comfirmed hummans. Just before Chun got killed by Derek, He invited me there! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So I had acces to whole info about Mush Hunt since begining, and I lied that I was invited by Chun just before She got killed... THAT GAVE ME SMALL ADVANTAGE OVER FRIEDA! ^^</p><p>What happened next? You will learn at new year... Or maybe earlier than that? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> We will see... But just in case...</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico">HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"></p>

I honestly don't remember her doing anything useful other than printing the list (which contained Roland's name after his death so pretty useless), she never even contacted me or helped me find the Mush. I hope she reads this so she can explain her situation...</p>

                <p>Tommorow I will finish my story completly. Was unable to do this today due to... New Year celebration being very Polish like? ^^ Yea...</p><p>So tommorow I will write all that happened untill very end. But I think that You are right my dear Chun - it must have been Roland that was left in Parshipae <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> No other way!</p><p>As for Eleesha's activity... You might have not seen Her, but trust me that I did keep an eye on Her all this time. She was active very rarely... But She was walking around, giving relays from time to time, and I saw Her checking on PILGRED as well. Also, She did two things after Your death ^^ But definietly She was all that time rather secondary hero <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> After Your death Frieda and Andie became main humman characters, but Eleesha stayed same <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Ohh... That was very long AP so far. Time to finish it as far as my story comes. So, last I stopped on how Frieda and I (Raluca) were "figting" our little propaganda war <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I killed Janice, while Frieda noticed that in logs (what a surprise! Of course She did noticed it! That was only expected) and decided to raise alarm about "Raluca is Mush". But in all that I had one advantage - just before Chun was killed, Derek invited me to Chun's Secred Channel <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> There was info about whole Mush Hunt, and everybody who got there, was invited so far by Chun Herself...</p><p><strong>Mush Hunt Chat crew</strong></p><p>So... Who was in Chun's Trusted Channel? First of all there was Chun... Actually there was no more Chun, as She was dead - killed by Derek. But never mind that. Who else was there? There was of course Derek - my brave Beta Mush. He was first comfirmed humman (double eating in order to kill). Than there was Jin Su, who got illnes from expedition. And last comfirmed humman that was part of that channel was Kuan Ti. He got comfirmed by Paola's List. Here I would like to remind You that Kuan Ti did Astro job, so He was non-stop under camera and infecting Him alone was out of option for me. So Chun was right considering Him being humman. There was also Gioele who was comfirmed humman, but He was not part of this chat - most of game He was inactive, so I am not surprised that He was not invinted.</p><p>That is about who was there... But how about activity? Chun and Derek were ultra actives. But Chun was already dead, while Derek was Mush ^^ Next active person was Kuan Ti. Jin Su was behaving like inactive. No messeges at all. Kuan Ti was evidently very good player, but He was also of low vocal activity - and when He was saying something it was straight to the point. Always straight to the point. Which is good for private chats of this aim.</p><p><strong>First advantage of being in Mush Hunt Chat</strong></p><p>Frieda and I added a bit into general chaos that was following Chun's death. Moreover Chun's Radio got pirated by Derek and everybody saw Chun accusing Eleesha of being Mush. In all this Stephen come active and... And I have litelary no idea what He did in all this time. <em>We honestly believed that He went away in Parshipae back than!</em> One thing was sure for everybody - I or Frieda must die! As one of us will be Mush for sure. Well... Firstly I was "trusted" for those who were in Chun's Chat. Secondly... I was active all time, giving advices to hummans etc, while Frieda was active only by action, not otherwise. She was silent one untill this point. So I took my chance and asked Jin Su to give mission to Derek, so He can check logs in Alpha Dorm and kill guilty party. And imagine THIS! Jin Su did that! Derek got mission just after He killed Chun! Of course nobody knew that He killed Chun, and that He is Mush. Now Derek got back some of lost AP... And He decided that He might be able to kill Andie (Silver Polyvalent and Pilot).</p><p><strong>STRENGHT vs EDUCATION! Part 1</strong></p><p>So Derek left His Bravo Dorm, and went to Medlab in order to kill Andie... But before that, I asked Him to take out two remaining oxygene capsule from tank. He did that, and we found ourself at C1 with zero oxygene ^^ Of course I holded on 1 capsule, while Derek now had two of them.</p><p>Anyway He came into Medlab in order to kill Andie... <strong><em>BUM! BUM!</em> HIT! HIT! HIT! HIT! HIT! HIT!</strong> Andie was damaged, but still alive. Derek decided to hide together with me and Eleesha behind Ian's Pacifist. So killing Andie didn't went that well for Derek. Now it was Andie's turn... Exept She was offline for now...</p><p><strong>My protection needs a little more protection!</strong></p><p>So... I was in Lab with Ian. I had one oxy capsule, scooter and my iTrackie (I was blind to not see Brainsynch). And than I noticed something wonderfull! Somebody left Body Armor in Lab! Oh! Don't You agree that it would be tragic if I would allow it to go into wrong hands? Of course I put down scooter and took that armor <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Now with Ian and this they could try to kill me all they wanted!!!</p><p>5 minutes later I saw Ian leaving Lab. DAMN IT! Now I was better protected, but not THAT good to survive ton's of attacks. And everybody knew I was in Lab... So I decided to go elswhere. Now - most logical place to go was Bravo Dorm (Jin Su went there just after giving Derek mission) to get 2 AP from bed and 1 from Jin's Logistic (Gold Logistic, Shooter, Strateguru and Leader). But what I did insted? I just went to Alpha Dorm, and knocked off Frieda from Bed. And that is how I ended my day of Mush. I expected to wake up next morning and to see that I am killed. Before I went to sleep though I waited to see one more cycle change - to check who get's killed by lack of oxygene. Kuan Ti was targetted. Now there was nobody to repair PILGRED. But still there was Tech book. But as hummans will be killed one by one each cycle I didn't really cared about that. I went sleep, feeling that I already won...</p><p><strong>STRENGHT vs EDUCATION! Part 2</strong></p><p>Next morning I log in, and what I see? Firstly I am still alive. Secondly I got less HP than I should have, so they did tried to kill me. Secondly we have few dead hummans from lack of oxygene... Oh! Wait! <strong>Derek</strong> is <em>dead!!!</em> Who killed Him? Of course Andie! Hahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> She looked surprised to see Him being Mush. Frieda was also very surprised and said "Great! Now I am officialy mixed up!" Nobody expected THAT! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Andie killed Him because He tried to kill Her, so She thought that He might be kind of "We lost, let's finish it faster than" person. At first She even thought we may repair PILGRED and come back to Sol! But than She realized that I am a Mush, and need to be killed. Also Andie picked up one oxygene capsule, but could not put it into oxy tank yet.</p><p>Eleesha was screaming that Chun got all wrong and that She is not a Mush (haha!) but She propably believed at begining in what I said about Frieda! So She did attacked few times Frieda. Unfortunatly after that She DID noticed logs in Alpha Dorm and She hit me many times... If not that armor I would be dead! But I had armor and was alive! Time to bring bit more chaos! ^^</p>

                <p><strong>Who as dead and who still alive?</strong></p><p>So far Terrence, Roland(Mush), Chun and Janice were first to die. They all got killed directly. Next person who died was Kuan Ti - lack of oxygene. After that - I don't know how it went exacly, but Ian certanly died due to low oxygene, and I think Paola as well. Somewhere in all that Derek(Mush) was killed by Andie.</p><p>That ment Frieda, Andie, Eleesha, Jin Su, Gioele, Stephen, Raluca (Mush), Hua (Inactive) were all that was left from original crew. But that also ment I was alone, and they could just gangup and kill me. Especially after all that Eleesha did to me. I was only 5HP left. And cycle change was comming near - so I could die at any moment from steel plate.</p><p><strong>Case Fire with Frieda</strong></p><p>Death of Derek, and fact that He was Mush caused great surprise among remaining hummans. Noticably Andie and Frieda were surprised. I acted like I am myself surprised about that, and started to remind everybody that Derek was trusted by Chun... Frieda in the open started to question Chun's deductive abilities. I decided to join - I reminded everybody about Roland's strange behavior, how He entered Engine Room and nothing happened to Him (never mind that He just got killed by Chun), how Terrence was killed without much investigation about Him (never mind that it was right decision). In short - I made Chun look guilty. The more guilty She looked, the less quilty I looked ^^I guess it worked a bit.</p><p>Now... As I said earlier - there was perfectly valid reason I could want to kill Janice even if I would be humman. But I got this reason/idea only AFTER I sleept, not before. I contacted Frieda directly and started to talk with Her even yesterday - but that was conversation that didn't included anything going on ship. It was by all means a private conversation... But channel was open all this time. So I decided to talk with Her a bit in private... About Janice's death. Firstly I told Her that I assumed that She is our Mush, and seeing Derek being one, I am surprised and no longer sure of that. Than I admitted that it was me indeed who killed Janice and at once I explained my reasoning. This is how it was:</p><p>- Frieda claimed that Eleesha run away in Parshipae AFTER Chun accused Her of being Mush and being killed (in reality by Derek, but back than everybody believed it was Eleesha).</p><p>- Eleesha is not a pilot, so could not do that without changing NERON settings first. So She could be hi lvl Mush that can pick apropriate skill (that was obviously not the case - if She would than ship would be destroyed long time ago), take Hacker Kit and use it (I claimed that I checked Nexus for that - no Eleesha entering it in logs, hence it was impossible - not to mention AP wasted to do that) and Janice changing BIOS in such way to help Eleesha. Add to that this strange Hull Damage that occured so suddenly, and we had reasons - somebody was just crashing ships by taking off and landing! <em>This was given by me as reason on why I thought that Janice is a Mush that is working with Eleesha, and why I instantly killed Her!</em></p><p>Moreover:</p><p>- after killing Janice and finding out that Eleesha was in Lab, I was sure that Frieda was trying to protect Eleesha by lying about Parsiphae and hiding Her true location for those few cycles untill Ian will not come online to tell the truth. <em>This argument was used by me as a reason to thing all time that Frieda IS a Mush working together with Eleesha</em>.</p><p>All this is logical way of thinking. It's only flaw was that it was most propably Roland who got abandoned in Parsipae! Something that nobody knew untill now - after ship ended!!! So at that time of chaos, my argumentation seemed very strong for Frieda... In fact - She stopped attacking me and started to believe me. We together agreed that Eleesha must be our last Mush, and that we should kill Her ASAP... EVERYTHING was spoken in private! No messages in main disscusion - all in secret!!! So Andie and Eleesha could not have known.</p>

                <p><strong>Eleesha's death and what happened to Andie...</strong></p><p>Problem with Eleesha was that She managed to inflict high damage to me, and I would not survive Her another activity for sure - armor or not. Well... RGN could saved me of course by making Her missing a lot, but with 5 HP even 3 hits could be deadly if I would be unlucky.</p><p>RGN helped me a lot! Eleesha died on cycle change! YES!!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> One active and dangerous humman less to worry about! There were only Andie and Freda that I had to worry about. I took care of Frieda - made Her believe me that I was Humman. Well... Maybe not believe - but to consider it as something very propable. She was lying in Medlab.</p><p>Andie was my second problem. How to deal with Her? JUST LISTEN!!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Remember that Chun's Secret Chat? The one that I was part off thanks to Derek? The one in which I was very vocal about how Chun invited me into RIGHT before She got killed? ^^ Yep! After I saw Andie killing Derek I immidietly invited Her there, and explained that we are all hummans here, and by killing Derek She proven to be humman as well, so I can trust Her. I pointed out on Frieda and Eleesha being most propably our Mushes. Andie... Hmm... I think that seeing me in Chun's channel made Her consider my words and belief me bit more than originaly. Moreover I was very vocal in main disscusion about how Frieda wanted to protect Eleesha by lying that She went off in Parshipae ^^</p><p>Andie trusted me eoungh to confess to two things - firstly that She has one oxy capsule that Derek left after death, secondly that She has only 2 HP and will need healing from me. My reaction?</p><p>"Just tell me where are You and do You have medkit with You!" - well, She was in Bravo Dorm and DID had medkit <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Moreover She had 4 AP... So I asked Her if She could heal me twice, and than I would heal Her twice as well.</p><p>Andie was glad of this agreement <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Plan was to get better both of us, and than together take down Frieda (Eleesha died of oxygene and everybody could see that She was humman). All right... So I go out of my dorm... Than I enter Rear Corridor... DAMN IT!!! I am short on AP and doors to Bravo Dorm just got broken... I picked up Wrench and used Tech point to repair it... NOPE! 75% and fail... Second try costed me an AP, but got them open... Entered Bravo Dorm...</p><p>And here I expected two things. First is to get killed by Andie at once. Second - to get healed by Andie <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Thanksfully Andie decided to heal me! So She choose to trust me! <strong>ANDIE!! I CAN NOT THANK YOU FOR THAT MORE!!!</strong> If You would not healed me back than twice! I would die! I would not lived through next cycle change!!! So... <strong><em>THANK YOU MY LOVELY PRINCESS!!!</em></strong> You are so awesome Andie <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I am sooooo sad it had to end like that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> <strong>HIT! HIT!</strong> And...</p><p><strong>Death Registered</strong> Andie: cause <em>assasination</em></p><p>What can I tell? I really, really would love to heal You back, but... You see... I was Mush! And You were my enemy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Sorry I had to behave like total jerk! OMG! You just healed me for 6 HP and in return I just killed You right after! Hahahahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Again - I am sorry! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Still... I consider that to be kind of funny <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But why not stir things up a bit? Maybe I would even manipulate Frieda to kill Stephen for me? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Or Gioele? Or Jin Su?</p><p>Only alive were Frieda, Raluca (Mush), Stephen, Hua (inactive), Gioele, Jin Su. Rest were dead.</p><p>So... I was kind of jerk with Andie, right? That is not end! Under Her death message I wrote: <cite>"FRIEDA!!! Andie! I prommise that I will kill Frieda before this ship will blow up to pieces! I prommise You that I will get revange for Your death... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">"</cite> Now THAT was really Jerk-like of me ^^</p><p>Frieda responded quickly, by trying to convince that it was not She, and that She was all this time in Medlab. She really tried her best to convince me that it was not Her <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Eventually I decided to "believe" Her and suggested Jin Su, Gioele or most propably Stephen did that. Frieda went to check on them! Unfortunatly She only found that there were not moving out of ther locations in few last cycles...</p><p><strong>Lie to the end!</strong></p><p>Frieda just come into Dorm with me... And She complemented me on my ability to lie and always surprise... Than She told me that She will miss me no matter how it will end. After that Frieda unleashed Her all AP in attempts to kill me. She got me down to 6 HP before cycle change.</p><p>On all this I only answered (that was a joke only - I of course didn't expected Her to beliefe me):</p><p><cite>That wasn't me!</cite></p><p>On that She said only:</p><p><cite>Best liar ever &lt;3</cite></p><p>Those were last words that were spoken on this ship by anybody else than I. Those were last humman words. Frieda was not last humman standing, but She was last humman that made a stand against Mush. And this short sentence was last sentence that was told directly to me on that ship. Cycle change was comming near...</p><p><strong>Death registered</strong> Frieda: cause <em>lack of oxygene</em></p><p>From this very moment I felt totally alone. Jin Su and Gioele together comminted sucide (lack of morale!) and only ones left were Stephen and Hua(inactive)... And Stephen had two spores already attached by Roland. Could I allow it to waste?</p><p>I just went to Him and spicked Him, succesfully turning Him into Mush. Than I went on Bridge. Ship was mine. Only wait for hunters to finish it in next cycle... But that didn't happened. Insted Hua died from lack of oxygene. On very next cycle NERON got rid of me and Stephen. My lonely torments ended finnaly.</p><p><strong>What I was doing while waiting for an end?</strong></p><p>My last moments I spent reading that Astro Book, adding some comments to past disscusions and writing messages for those who could decided to check disscusion before comfirming death...</p><p>But mainly I concentrated on reading whole disscusion... Remembering how fun and awesome ship it was, reminding myself what nice people I had pleasure to be with... I remembered this ship teeming with life, trying to oppose me in many ways. I reminded myself of You Chun, of Derek and Rol... No, that one was left behind in my memories ^^ Ehh... Seriously - it might be just a game, but I really got attached to all of You and... Well... Each time I was loging in to check how long till end I DID FELT THAT I WAS ALONE!!! And it was not nice feeling really, even though that ment my total victory.</p><p><strong><em>The End.</em></strong></p>

                <p>Well, this was as magnificent as I expected to be. Now I also know what happened after my death. In fact, now I'm glad about the chain of events, which is:</p><p>1. Chun was too stubborn to die - no seriously, there was one punch that went up to 93% before it landed. I wasted 4 shooter points (2 blasters) and a hell of lot of action points on her and no she was NOT wearing armor.</p><p>2. I had not as many action points for Andie (who by the way also got lucky). He got some punches from me but was still alive. Then after cycle change, I had received 2 new shooter points and the blaster's charges went up by 1 each AND I had received Jin Su's mission that said something along the lines of "Do what you will, we are doomed anyway." Still, both shots and 2 out of 4 punches missed.</p><p>3. Andie was still alive to heal Raluca later on and pay for it with his life - oh, the irony. As much as I enjoy being Mush myself, this must have been one of the most treacherous moments so far and it didn't even come from me. Hah!</p><p>Maybe we see each other again on a future ship, everyone. But then hopefully on the same side.</p><p>Fare thee well!</p>

I have nothing to say besides that I chose to heal you in order to play my role as a naive, unexperienced young girl. I was sad I was killed after that, I'd definitely serve you as long as I can.

                <p>Congratulations to people in the drama of this ship weighing in. Well done Europa for your social machinations. Mush certainly is a (anti) social game! Not too many other games would call for this much backtracking and remembering conversations/decision making and then recounting it on a forum for the fans of the game to en-mass read and enjoy. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> I certainly enjoyed the full account. Mush is so addictive because of the survival aspect, the Player v Player, and the fact that you can shine in a character role that is unique. The special people I've come across in Mush are the ones who go above the expected inter-activity and excel at pushing at the games limitations to truly <em>reach the stars</em>! I'll call out some names: <span class="tid_user tid_user_7694941 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7694941">Bofeng</span> <span class="tid_user tid_user_7899692 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7899692">agewisdom</span> <span class="tid_user tid_user_1270529 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1270529">Pumpy</span> <span class="tid_user tid_user_1270529 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1270529">Pumpy</span> <span class="tid_user tid_user_8222490 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8222490">Diane</span> <strong>Ferhago , eAe , Skeksi, Gargaron, Xeram, Kyubey</strong>, and there are a tonne more. I have played Mush for nearly a year, and the reason I now avoid the <strong>"Start the Game"</strong> button is how involved I want to be. I certainly wouldn't feel like expounding on a game as much as you, Europa, but then you forget otherwise how good it is to fool someone or discover a plot of sabotage or conversation. The whole of <em>your</em> game revolved about how to fool people, and with Frieda and Andie you certainly used the PMing best of all. <br>Best $20 or so I've spent on a game. Also, one of the best gaming communities cause we just "get it". While I certainly have experienced toxic players, it's nothing like the League of Legends amount of toxic! All the best for your future adventuring, all. God bless. Lolzers. (Check out Psalm 148 <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">)</p>
