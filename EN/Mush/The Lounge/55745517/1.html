Yes, I'll believe I'll say is your decision to make if the ships or crews reached its limits but this doesn't mean that you could fly without any words.. I'll hope is someone is hacking the terminal. </span></p><p>Anyway, the ships events started on <strong>D2C5</strong>. Filled with gold and silver. Only 3 of us crews are bronze.</p><p>The whole crews is active but only 1 crews is inactive which is Raluca only.. There's are 3 or 4 semi-active crews but wouldn't want to reveal <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/sifflote.gif" alt=":-&quot;" class="tid_ico"></p><p>My chapters began as a stowa- <em>cough, cough</em>.. I meant as Participant/Technico <em>(legally)</em></p><br><p>Let's see,<br>Did I ever to told, I'll got myself as suspected mush from Chun quick ill-tempered issues on sofa bp on Bridge.. Pretty funny as I'll did built sofa on the Bridge on D2C4 and written on the public messages threads but was still pressing issues from Chun that assuming that I'll hide the tube and metal scraps when I'm taking them from AD.. Until I'll show my evidence post message to clarify my innocent (still under suspicious list).. From Chun moving is pretty funny from AD-AB-CAS-CAT-FS.. Well she did give a good scolding on me that I'll was on purpose in draining her ap/mp investigation. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Mush samples was another funny story.. She also ask on my weird pattern walking between FAT-Bridge-FBT-FC-HG-FS-CAT-AB-AB2-AB-CC-FC-FAT..I'll told Chun that I'll was looking the mush samples as Janice walks the bottom part of the ships. Hua found the samples at BB.. I'll was out from ap to moved them to lab and told Chun.. So Chun moved the samples and yet giving me a motherly scolding on my ap/mp usage. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Well, here's my logs date journal on what happens to the ships: <em>is private, whisper</em></p><br><p><strong>D4C3</strong> | <strong><em> AD Room<br><br></em></strong>I'll remember the expo mishap I'll talk with Hua on the ruminants chances,as Capitan of ours say these 2nd expo is harmless and prefer a solo mission. I'll mean I'll know a space cow is harmless.. How did I'll ever know it's just charges at her straight.. Sorry Hua.. But I'll did say RNG has a weird humors on us. So I'll heal her twice.</p><br><p>Let's see I'll did see Roland burn the AD, BD and ER.. He took 1 extinguisher from BD and some sort of BP from ER and fly with Parishae. I was looking the 2nd extinguisher around the mid quarters but failed from AD-RC-RBS-ER-AB2-RC-AD-RC-BB-CBS-BB-CC-AB-CAS-AD. (I'll didn't notice the 2nd extinguisher was being taken)..<img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico">, . Luckily, I'm was watching him and the icon alarm in the same time.. So in counter measure on fires issues, I'll have taken 2 metal scraps and drones with me from AB2 to AD.. I'll was so kind for Terrence to patch these baby up.. But it did give me a good scare, I'll was about to copy Terrence robotics skills.. But he did a great work working on Fido and Groo as Fire-fighter.. He's dismantle microwave from Ref. He placed 2 drones which is AD and ER..He's my hero and Hua as well, she's help too. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The decision is tough as the ships is not installed Magnetic Net. Roland is a gold mode players and he's was very aggressive and he might return again after his pyro-maniac acts.. But our Capitan decided to abandon him. So that's ends our Parishae ships...</p><br><p><strong>D4C6 and C7</strong> | <strong><em>AD Room</em></strong></p><p>I was invited into the mush hunts chat due of Finola list printed.. Is always the lonely and suspicious participant is taken the heat first then proven innocent, lastly. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Let's see the fire from AD and ER is clear but unfortunately fire BD spread to BB while ER fire spread to IB. Between D4C4-D4C6, from what I knew when logging in. On <strong>D4C6</strong>, I was patrolling to ER again to check on RAT. I'll was assume the 2nd extinguisher was hidden to RAT so I'll was walking through on AD-RC-<strong>RAS</strong>... What, I'll noticed Roland has found the 2nd extinguisher in RAS and with his I-Trackie burn and destroyed at ER.. I'll assume he's taken all the extinguisher with him. So I ended my search but somehow Eleesha was double check my confirm so she checked on where I'll was walking.</p><br><p><strong>D4C7</strong> | <strong><em>AD Room</em></strong></p><p>Our Chun wish to research pheromodem is wish to be discreetly but somehow is was being leak (on 86%).. Thus on .. Eleesha is being weird. She's took medikit, wrench and scooter and head to RBT where Raluca is.. From there on, I'll was suspicious on her.. I'll talked with Chun that did she notify on Eleesha on these transfer equipment sadly no... So well Raluca/Eleesha transfer came through AD and then to CAS and back to AD and well.. You get the picture.. Is was horrifying. She was targeting me but I'll have left AD to RC quick and quickly chat to Chun that Raluca is a mush transfer from Eleesha but sadly Raluca killed Hua (gold) and Terrence (silver) our best tech...</p><p>In the chaotic events.. Jin (was proven human from illness) and Janice was also active on my cycles watch.. I'll was wondering how did Janice awake in the same time as Raluca/Eleesha attacks on the Techs.. I was afraid she's 3rd mush. When Jin told me to head to Bridge to provide rations to him.. He was trying to killed Raluca so I'll assist him on the Bridge providing rations and we began to killed Raluca, our 2nd mush. When I'll was returning to BD to rest, I'll remember Janice (clean) heading to REF and taken 1 rations. She's dirty at BD when I'll enter plus she drops the rations from where she took from REF. So, I'll was abit worry on her status. I'll talked with Chun did Chao ever torture her but is not.. Caused from Janice didn't get illness from the the crews death. So is impossible she's dirty unless.... Then Janice head to Lab to comfort Chun and few crews. Janice mentioned she have an illness on gastroenteritis. I asked Chun again to talk with Janice where she's vomit. And the results, she's a human after all. She's vomits on BB and Lab (she's was comforting the crews). I'll was worry I'll might shout Janice as a mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Thus ends the mush hunts but Eleesha have taken the medikit, wrench and scooter before she's transfer.. After the pheromodem research to checked of any additional mush but sadly no conversion or infected.. Thus it's ends, or is it ? <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><strong>D5C3-D5C8</strong> | <strong><em>Engine Room</em></strong></p><p>Well, taken the skills as Technico from where I'll began.. Pilgred has been tremendous helped with Chun and Jin's Mission. Kuans as tech helped as well.. We're on 95%.. Chun was afraid there's another mush so we agree we're not pushing the last button. Unfortunately, Mr Kuan push the button without reading the message... So the Pilgred completes. <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_pilgred.png" alt=":mush_pa_pilgred:" class="tid_ico"> Plus I'll need to head to Bridge to repair Comms Terminal for our D5 rebel base decodes by Poala. But was succeeded on D6C5. And lucky is our Poala decode D5 to solve our crews morale issues, she's my hero, too <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><strong>D8</strong> | <strong><em> Daedalus ships</em></strong></p><p>Our Capitan, try his ancestor naval defense technique from Korea. The turtle ships defense known as <strong>Geobukseon</strong>. Unfortunately the ships took two asteroids direct hits that bypass the plasma shield. Costing it 40. From 78 to 38.. But our Capitan is tired as he's effortlessly defending the ships as the sole active pilot. Fighting against hunters while steering the ships. He's my hero as well. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And I'll forced to killed highly inactive Eleesha by my own hands due from equipment she's hoarding (medikit, wrench, and scooter) from mush transfer.. We're being interrupt the trade twice (was given opportunity twice to trade) from Day 5 issue. Chao try to shove Eleesha alot from RBT to any of RBS or RAS but was keeps pushing around the end quarters ships till she's highly inactive in AB2 from D6-D7. I'll got tired, sorry Eleesha/Raluca if you see that way and i'LL decided to take another approach. Plus the ships has been moved anyway... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/calim.png" alt=":calim:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><strong>D9C2</strong> | <strong><em>Icarus Bay</em></strong></p><p>Well, Janice found our 1st star fragments from 2nd expo.. The expo was dangerous with 4x oceanic, high temperature, 2x intelligent life,cyrstalite, desert and forest. She's traveled with Frieda. She's my hero as well and she's brings lots of meats <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico">.. Research is made and all from Finola and Chun. Whereas I'm slacking myself in BD.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/surprised.png" alt="8D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><span class="tid_wspoil"><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/18713" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/18713</a></span></p><br><p><strong>D10C8-D11C3</strong> | <strong><em>AD Room</em></strong></p><p>Well Janice... She died from expo accidents.. From what I'll heard.. She's traveled with Ian alone with the risk but unfortunately RNG was not too kind with her. The results are unable shows when I'll went to IB to checked but sadly no reports on expo.. I was suspecting Ian a 3rd mush due to defacer and he's alive from expo but I'll was wrong. The logs exist, so it clearly Ian not a mush.. The expo is cruel as it consists on Insects, Predators, Ruminants, Cristalite, Desert, Desert, Desert, Forest, Oceanic, Oceanic, High Temperatures, Low Temperatures, Low Temperatures; Hydrocarbon Deposits. From what I'll gathered she's being pummel to death from some sort of Cristalite ambush and insane heat death march. Equipment lost from Janice is <strong>Spacesuit, Drill and Compass</strong>... You're still my hero, Janice <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We're down to 9 crews.. 7 crews died</p><br><p><em><strong>D11C3 was the ends of the ships journey and chapters..</strong></em></p><br><p><strong>Logs ends</strong></p><p>Well, we tried our best. I'll have subsequently taken care the ships maintenance from <strong><em>D5 - D11</em></strong> as <strong>Technico Bronze</strong> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_eng.png" alt=":mush_eng:" class="tid_ico"> alone but with some help.. Very tired and annoying posted on the Drones status from fire to minor repairs details when I'm doing the work. But I'll enjoyed myself with tequila drinks, nachoes, guacamole.. and also Pinata.. <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/discrete.png" alt=":mush_chut:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Is nice playing with you, guys.. <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico"></p>
