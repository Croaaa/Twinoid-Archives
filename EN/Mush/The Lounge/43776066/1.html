Active people, plenty of RP, and me as MUSH! There were talks that this was the best ship some people had ever flown on!<br>Well, I do remember saying something along the lines of:<br><span class="tid_sideNote">It's still early, for now everyone is active an happy, but that generally happens at the start of some voyages, doesn't necessarily last.</span></p><p>And boy was I right! The first few hours of the ship after Mush selection where a blast! Plenty of jokes, playful threats and an Andie which REFUSED to define their gender!</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Andie</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">There are 4 types of genders:<br>He: Obviously manly.<br>She: Got all the right girly bits in all the right places.<br>It: I'm not so sure about this one.. And,<br>Shit: A mix of all of the above.</span></span></p><p>It was fun, but it was time to get my game-face on. My partner was Frieda, and we considered our options, which were quite few to be honest. With cameras setup across half the ship it was going to be a pain in the mush to convert anyone. So, for the time being, I played human, moved the medlab camera to the lab (didn't get dirty, sigh) and proceeded to work on Anti-spore gas. Now I never lied when I said I had potato internet, though the thoughts among the crew were somewhat against me. While relaying ASG with Eleesha, my game picked up the apron but actually didn't and I got dirty researching. Eleesha even thought I still had the apron even though I never picked it up! That was completely unintentional, regardless of how helpful it was for me. I took Fertile and Splash proof and grabbed my 2 spores and headed off to shower.</p><br><p>Frieda's online times didn't line up with me as much as I liked, she was rarely able to be online during day change but that was fine by me. It was late cycle 7 early cycle 8 when we decided we'd act. ASG was done by then so Frieda went mycelium spirit and infector, and I too went infector and readied ourselves for our first beta. Eleesha, all alone in the med-lab, although she was observant that didn't deter us. We desperately needed a beta, so we were going to get one whether she liked it or not! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>When it comes down to the wire, luck was entirely on our side. We both timed it so Frieda would put the first spore and I'd come and slap the last two and take annonymush. And victory! Beta Mush! And observant didn't see anything! Well, for a minute or two it didn't.<br><em>Eleesha has noticed something <strong>interessting</strong></em>.<br>I held myself together and calmly reported what pills where available to us, like I was asked earlier. In the mean time I'm sprawling all over the MUSH chat PLEADING with Eleesha to take defacer and deface it. Her response?<br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Eleesha</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">You guys are like totally found out, you need to rampage NOW! What you did was the most obvious thing EVER! Seriously. I'm going to throw my grenade in AD and do as much damage as possible. You took a great risk in doing that, and you're probably going to be found out now.</span></span><br>I giggled a little as my newly paranoid beta sprawled and screamed. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> I calmed her down and attempted to slap some sense into her while she rapidly copied/pasted ALL of the mush hunt chat messages in the mush channel. Both Frieda and I were suspected, but the humans didn't think it was enough evidence to act on. I ordered my new slave to give me the medlab bed for the cycle then the room was defaced and all evidence was erased. Eleesha had a fairly high level MUSH so she took Defacer, Fertile and mycelium spirit, saving the last slot for annonymush.</p><br><p>Thanks to ACTOPI protocol (don't remember who bought it) the three mushkiteers noticed 'RTL' in BB, all alone. Frieda was gone by then and it was getting close to day change. With the extra spore from mycelium Eleesha moved to the turret and extracted a spore before daychange and infected Kuan. Shortly after day change I extracted 2 spores, popped one in Kuan on the way to Bravo Dorm and secret showered, while Eleesha put on the last spore and annonymushed. In the short span of 1 day we were already 4 mush, but only 3 mush strong. Turns out Kuan had a problem with his flash player and that's why he was stuck in BB to start off with. He did his best to try and communicate with us but in all honesty he was a little bit of dead weight. It was D3C1 at this point and Hua reported the soap showers of Ian and Terrence in the MUSH hunt chat, according to Eleesha. I was flying under the radar it seems, and I pretended to be AFK 'working' for the next few cycles while we planned and planned and planned. Our next move was going to be a bold one!</p><br><p>Close to day-change, Kuan managed to get himself working so we hatched a plan. Eleesha and Kuan (both techs) would attempt to dismantle the Mush Genome disk (so no cure/phero), then Eleesha would bring all the pots to the lab and lob a grenade in there in an attempt to hurt whoever was in there and possibly damage equipment and/or items. Afterwards, we would attempt to convert Hua under the camera with Eleesha defacing shortly after day-change. The disk dismantle was successfully carried out by Kuan Ti however the rest of the plan didn't go so well... Eleesha grenaded the lab but little to no damage occurred. My initial spike was seen by Hua who quickely shouted and screamed in the Mush hunt chat something along the lines of:</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Hua</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Andie just spiked me before daychange!<br>I'm going to kill the bitch!</span></span></p><p>[More coming momentarily, message is too long <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">]</p>

                <p>Well, Hua ran off, I figured 'here goes our plan right down the drain', but she came back, blaster and sniper helmet in had.<br><em>Miss... Miss... Hit..</em><br>Defacer went up and Eleesha spiked and we had planned for Kuan to spike too but he was lollygagging off in some turret. So I extracted another spore and jabbed her just before she left. Having no idea what exactly was going on, Hua confusedly spoke to us in the MUSH hunt chat as Eleesha and I mentally tore Kuans head off. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Kuan decides he wants to punch the hell out of Gioele who has the knife as we all realize our cover is blown and we're running out of options. Suddenly it hits me: There are 5 MUSH now! Well, pretending Frieda isn't Mush, 4 of us could hole up in IB while the humans would be flabberghasted! Once again, Eleesha is freaking out and wanting to do as much damage as possible but I convince everyone to rush over to IB. Well, Eleesha, Hua and I managed to get their quick smart but Kuan decided to continue his lollygagging and mutated and slapped Gioele silly. Talk about a loose cannon. We also managed to get 2 spores on Terrence at the time too. Kuan finially managed to get to IB and we were somewhat safe as the humans couldn't do anything.</p><br><p>The humans attempted to play dumb (or at least some of them did) as they confusedly tried to figure out what had actually transpired. At that time I felt invincible and I popped onto the TE IRC to pretend to be one of the humans to prod them for ideas, only to reveal my mushiness and gloat a little. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> According to everyone there, the main option they came up with to stop us was the vital removal of O2 in an attempt to starve the Mush before the humans. So, using that plan against them, the 3 of us; Hua, Eleesha and myself decided to rush for the O2 tanks and grab as much as possible. At that time there was 11(?) O2 so us grabbing it wouldn't leave them much to work with, or much time to work with it. We timed it perfectly; right as cycle change went (or slightly before) we all sprinted to CBS, nabbed the O2 then right back to Icarus.... Man it was a VERY Intense wait for the minutes ticking down.. We managed to do it successfully and in the remaining humans chat (which Frieda was in) Jin su said:<br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Jin Su</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">We lost...</span></span></p><p>The adrenaline was splashing through my veins as we still continued plotting. Since Kuan mutated, he wasn't able to get O2, so <em>if</em> he died we'd be in a real bad spot. We told Frieda to be online at cycle change for the next few cycle if possible just in case he died so she could sprint down and take his place. Well soon enough he woke up and decided to slap Gioele silly but being the lollygag he is he was super slow risking the entire Mush team. Luckily Frieda swooped in to save us, although Kuan still caused multiple problems for us. Eleesha and I decided we'd drop off 2 O2 and let Frieda grab them to lower the chances of her dying from O2, but when we moved Kuan and his bulky mutated body sat in our way... Eleesha and Frieda retreated back to IB but I persisted...<br><em>Refresh... Refresh... Refresh...<br>Kuan Ti has left the room.</em><br>I yelled in Mush chat "He's gone, move move move!" but unfortunately Eleesha could no longer make it so Frieda only got 1 of my O2. Being able to read through the main discussion then being invited to the human chat by Frieda really made my day.. I felt so.. So powerful. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I headed off to bed with a big smile on my face while we kinda let Kuan hang out to dry... <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/sifflote.gif" alt=":-&quot;" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I wake up a little earlier and of course my little minions are planning furiously for the next days work. The humans were starting to lower in numbers and day change approached. A new opportunity for spores and another conversion or two was definitely the way to go. A large majority of the dangerous humans (Raluca, Paola, Janice) died directly on day-change, and thankfully Terrence was still alive. They had actually tended to the plants so there was an extra 3 O2 in the tanks. I gave Hua the honor of turning her first mushroom (Terrence) while Eleesha and I waited for cycle change to finish off Jin. I went to eat my lunch and I came back and found that Terrence had woken up and he and Eleesha turned Jin. (That top glory spot could've been mine!!!) That only left Ian, who had retreated to AB2 right at daychange and taken off in one of the ships. Most of us shoved our O2 back into the tanks since we knew Ian wasn't too much of a threat. All the mushy techs worked on PILGRED from 35% to completion and we jetted off to Sol, Ian in tow.</p><p>I'd just like to say..<br>AWESOMEST<br>SHIP<br>EVEEEEER!<br>And another thing...<br>HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAAAHHAAHAH I converted an Impet! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Frieda, my mushy Alpha partner, so glad you stuck it out and so glad you weren't killed early, definitely enjoyed mushing with you! That ninja convert on Eleesha was AWESOME! You were an amazing partner and although you weren't able to be on at day change you were still a great asset to the team! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Eleesha, boy I was quite surprised to find out you were Impet! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Haahahahahahah!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I guess you're going to think twice before sleeping peacefully in that medlab again hey? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Every risk is worth it, especially if you can get away with it! You were my favorite beta slave and please don't ask me for a rematch, I'll loose! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Kuan Ti, man you were a loose cannon. There were at least 5 different times I thought we were going to loose because you were lollygagging off in a corner somewhere. Although I must admit it must take some real skill to play on a phone try and listen to your comrades a bit next time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Hua, you seemed very confused but you acted very well despite the circumstances. As much as I thought you were quite heroic rushing in there blaster in hand, generally speaking you should avoid confrontations with a mushroom especially if they have just spiked you.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Terrence, thanks for converting Jin when you did, although I swear you stole that top glory spot from me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Jin Su, you successfully rallied the humans (and a mushroom <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/sifflote.gif" alt=":-&quot;" class="tid_ico">) in an attempt to save the somewhat doomed ship, good effort but for now let the mushyness embrace you... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As for the rest of the humans, not so sure what happened behind the curtains of your secret little chats, but good effort trying to stop us. Some future advice: If you guys guarded RC and the engine room that definitely would've slowed us down. Perhaps Ian in RC and Chun in the medlab, since we can't convert Chun and Ian costs quite a lot.</p><p>Thanks for the good game everyone, I sure as hell enjoyed being an evil mushroom! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
