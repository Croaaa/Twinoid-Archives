                <p>After 3 weeks together, I feel compelled to do a lil shout out summary of each person. ^^</p><p><em>The Ones Who Lived</em></p><p><strong>Raluca/Justlikethat</strong>: This was Raluca's first ship, and she rocked it. I've never seen someone who wasn't a caffeine junkie running this way and that putting out fires and fixing important things as much as she did late game. One of the star players of this ship, and a delight to interact with as well.</p><p><strong>Janice:</strong> You were a jerk, and I loved it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Enjoyed reading just about everything you said, even if it was often a dig at me, heh. Did great on keeping morale up, and made things just dramatic enough by eating that fruit that gave you crabism. &gt;.&gt;</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong>: You did good, capt'n. Speeches and missions where and when needed, active enough on moving the ship.</p><p><strong>Chun</strong>: Used bio book to become our best researcher. Then later was our main healer. Key in keeping everyone alive. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Roland</strong>: Solid, piloty type. Didn't say much after the beginning of the ship, which was too bad, but knew he could be counted on to do stuff.</p><p><strong>Terrence</strong>: Ditto the above regarding Roland. Except that in addition, he was a dirty gold digger. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/tusors.gif" alt=":anim_out:" class="tid_ico"> But that's okay, Gio found love elsewhere, and I think will be very happy.</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong>: Great coordination in the mush hunt. Went pretty quiet afterwards, logged in to do what needed doing.</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti</strong>: Very dramatic and self important. Once declared that the ship would die because he didn't have a bed, although I suppose such things are to be expected of Kuan Ti. Did well with planet scanning when we needed it. Used AP on random things after we no longer needed planets, despite being asked a bunch to do specific things. Ah well.</p><p><strong>Paola</strong>: Very rarely talked, but put out some very entertaining announcements from time to time. Get the feeling she would have been lots of fun to interact with if she'd logged in more than once a day. Solid on comms, lasted almost to the end before sheet metal got her.</p><p><strong>Ian</strong>: Almost completely silent. Took care of plants decently til his death in the end days. Not much else to say there.</p><p><strong>Stephen</strong>: Our other first time player. Made some of the usual newbie mistakes (not the cooking tons of rations one, thankfully!), worked on NERON projects a lot. Was noticeably trying to do well. Was sad when he died. Hope you keep playing!</p><p><em>The Rest</em></p><p><strong>Chao</strong>: First aboard the ship. His actions were to find the armor, hacker kit and a blaster, and deactivate the peace core and death notifications. We didn't immediately kill him as a griefer once the ship filled, we waited until he refused to drop the armor for Chun or tell us where the hacker kit was.</p><p><strong>Finola</strong>: Alpha mush. Caught because no research or communication, lying on medlab bed dirty early on. After she was killed I went to shower and saw that she'd infected the cat almost a day prior and no one there had noticed. D'oh!</p><p><strong>Frieda</strong>: One of our alpha mush. Revealed herself to Chun sometime during the first week and asked to be cured. Of the people in the channel Chun told, a couple of them strongly wanted to kill her for ruining the mush hunt. I was on the fence, leaning towards curing her despite breaking the rules by telling us, but figured if she was going to die anyways, I might as well do it since I had the AP and the knife.</p><p><strong>Hua</strong>: Human, wandered the ship dirty eating pills every chance she could get. Started before mush selection, continued that way until Janice and I killed her.</p><br><p>Stay tuned, favorite moments to come!</p>

                <p>The first 2/3 of our journey is quickly summarized from my perspective. I stayed in the back of the ship, worked on Pilgred, helped with Neron projects, finished Pilgred after the Mush had been killed, and helped with Neron projects some more. I had bought gold on day 3 or 4 and upgraded Raluca to become a technician, so in between I fixed the hull, fueled the combustion chamber or repaired a thing or two. I took part in a few expeditions and got on everyone's nerves because I wanted them to carry the drones to where they were needed.</p><p>The last week is even easier to summarize: I extinguished fires and repaired oxygen tanks, oh so many of them, and not much else. I got the bed in medlab after research was done, but I still never had enough AP. I also tried to get everyone to continuously update their status in the health thread so that we would know who needed a healing the most. By far the most difficult task on this ship for me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>About the crew:</p><p>First, <strong>Gioele</strong>. Right at the beginning he welcomed Stephen and me, the newbies, and invited us into private chat which was a really nice thing to do. Gioele was everywhere and did everything, especially after Pilgred was finished. Mush hunting and fire fighting with Eleesha, helping out with research, shooting down hunters, healing people, and carrying drones around. On top of that he was great fun to talk to. We RP'ed our way through a 'secret' relationship including a near breakup after he killed my mush-infected cat. NooOOoOOOOoo! But all is well that ends well, Raluca and Gioele now live happily ever after on Sol, with two Pilgred-powered radioactive coffee machines. Shame that our time zones weren't more compatible. I hope we get on the same ship again sometime!</p><p><strong>Terrence and Roland</strong>, the other pilots, did also a great job at keeping hunters at bay. Terrence upgraded our 3 drones, which was a great help especially towards the end. Roland jumped in with healing or putting out a fire when it was needed.</p><p><strong>Chun</strong> was incredibly important, the only person qualified to work on research, later on our main healer, and of course, humanity's only hope. Got lost twice on explorations, nerve racking.</p><p><strong>Janice</strong>, you were hilarious, and kept our morale up in more ways than just through comforting. Also helped with research and projects, and had an eye on me when I had managed to get a bed in the dorms before I moved to the medlab.</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> became less active after the mush hunt was over, but she still did whatever was needed the most when she logged in, helping with research, putting out fires, going on explorations, and healing people.</p><p><strong>Stephen</strong>, the other newbie, helped with research and projects, went on explorations, converted alien steaks into rations, and was an all around nice and helpful player. We tried to keep you alive but with steel plates raining from above it was impossible. <br>The same is true for <strong>Ian</strong>, who expertly took care of our banana trees and went on explorations. We tried, friend, we tried. Shame that you were so quiet in general chat, why not get involved a bit more? Who cares if your English isn't perfect <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Paola</strong> took care of rebel bases, xyloph, and neron upgrades, and made some very amusing announcements. Was mostly quiet apart from that and became inactive at the end. Another victim of a ship that was shedding steel plates, shaking, and electrocuting people at an alarming rate.</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> did a good job advancing Neron projects and scanned planets after that. Didn't have much luck with finding planets that might get us a star map piece, but because Frieda was mush we started late seriously looking for planets and probably wouldn't have had a chance at Eden anyways. If only he hadn't developed this strange desire to become a technician without actually having the skill for it towards the end, fixing things that didn't need fixing, and taking the wrench and bottle opener away from me...</p><p>And last but not least, <strong>Jin Su</strong>, our Great Leader. What can I say? Gave very motivational speeches that left tears in my eyes. Expertly steered the Daedalus and brought us back to Sol in the end. Despite being our Great Leader, and therefore obviously very important, still involved in the gritty details of keeping everyone alive.</p><p>Good game everyone!</p>
