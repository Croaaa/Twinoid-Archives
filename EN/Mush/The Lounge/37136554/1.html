We were pretty sure Ian was our last mush and we were planning on sticking him with the serum. I will say I am most proud of the way Ian played. Instead of waiting for us to stick him with the serum he grabbed it, used it on Finola, grabbed a grenade and threw it in the medlab.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">He had no idea we were on to him, but felt the walls closing in as Eleesha's list was getting shorter. The fact he never gave up and used the serum after we pleaded makes me respect his style of play. Never played against his team, even though it would have helped his crew on a (at the time) promising ship.</span></p><p>Then Chun went batshit crazy and killed Jin for leading us and making sensible orders. Like not letting Chun sleep on beds cusz she goes 18-36 hours without checking in. Also to make sure the 2 peeps with logistics take the beds on the front of the ship while Frieda and Finola hand in the room to get logistics. Chun would rather go inactive in the medlab.</p><p>Ohh yeah I almost forgot about how we had Ian trapped. Myself guarding the FC and Jin gaurding the medlab with Ian trapped in the lab. Chun wakes up and without any posting on the boards or reading the private chat, just starts attacking Jin thin on the main boards (not the private forum) lets Ian know that we're both set on guard, which eventually leads to Ian getting the grenade.</p><br><p>Well we made it back to Sol despite Raluca dying when we boarded.</p>

                <p>indeed, at the begging when mush hunt was just starting, it took me 3 days just to get the book to Chun, as she rarely checked in. regret it now tbh, book would have been better in Stephens hands, who actually proved to the the best mush hunt partner (guarding O2 tanks, altho it turned out to be pointless <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">). contacted me, provided with logs from all over the ship, so i could calculate ap and this way we were more or less sure that Janice and Finola are not mushes. although we did not invite them in to the "clean" channel until the end just to be sure, apart from that you have done well, spent all your (1ap/cycle) properly, your location in the lab stopped us from grenade use against Ian (which turned out bad) and letting him finish the cure although i asked to avoid it wasn't cool, but those are minor flaws, this way we at least locked him. Among other things Finola never getting a bed was sad, once she went to BD and came back 1 minute later, which made very suspicious of her. Terrence gave me a fake log, truing to accuse Kuan ti, almost decided to kill Kuan ti after that, yet as with every other decision i consulted with the team firstly and Stephen later told me that log was fake. btw, Terrence, i ordered to kill you before you spored in front of Chao <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">. Who was the best Chao i played in a team against mush so far. Among our mistakes were Russian Eleesha, who didn't cooperate even when I refered to her in russian and Gioele, whose actions were completely random and unexplained. he crossed the line when he came to IB, where last infection has happened just before the expedition, sorry man, you were very suspicious. I also reacted too late, asking Janice to keep Raculas' morale high in case she comes back within a day. Janice you were a great player, I wasn't so fond of aggressive actions limit removal, as you saw Eleesha, for example later, it could have been dangerous in the end. Your hugs kept us all out of risk zone at all times, well done, also constant BIOS manipulations upon request were very handy! Paola have done very well, decoded all the bases and made 5 (i think) upgrades. You panicked a bit when we were low on O2, but came to senses fast. valuable logistics expert. shame we couldn't optimize our logistics and i had to stand in the lab to give Finola more ap instead of lying in the lab with her. Frieda <span class="tid_user tid_user_1819299 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1819299">Comedian</span> done pretty good with all the planets and mush cornering. Kuan ti should have been more talkative, people who don't talk tend to be suspicious, I almost never was in central or rear ship so I can't compliment you for your efforts as I know a little about them and you never boasted about them <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> . Hua and Roland- great work with hunters, a bit more [hunters killed+scrap collected would have been ideal], Hua helped with plant moving when we were about to throw a grenade, if only Chun wouldn't have made him aware of the cornering and grenade loss thereafter due to his awareness. Ian, you were to useful to the team, i didn't want to kill you because of that and altho we were on your back for 2 days already i said "no, lets cure him, he is a valuable player", my softness costed a lot, you have done more good to us than Chun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> even thought you wounded me and destroyed a number of drugs (and his a medkit, we knew you had it and found it right away).</p>

                <p>Hi guys, Janice here.</p><p>It was a fun ship and I was quite impressed with the mush hunt once I finally got to read the private mush hunt thread (still a bit sad I didn't get to help but I can understand the secrecy). It's really sad that after such a good start it all fell apart after the mush were gone. I actually was thinking of getting Diplomat at the end there but then the White Flag got built and I just didn't say anything. Special mention needs to go to Chao, Hua, and Stephen who were all really excellent players. Always seeming to be on hand to handle every problem. Jin, Paola, and Frieda were also great though I didn't really spend much time with any of you (being back in the dorms all the time and all that). If things hadn't turned out the way they did I have no doubt in my mind we would have made Eden on this ship.</p><p>Ah well. I hope to see you guys on another ship in the future. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Wasn't on the ship, but TSRD in case you didn't know; white flag cannot replace a diplomat at all. It's nowhere near as good as one - it's like being a diplomat for only intelligent life.</p><p>Your diplomat skill prevents fights with everything from insects to crystallite monsters; it effectively increases the odds of getting good results (or at least non-fight results) from every zone that could have resulted in a fight. It allows your crew to visit planets that probably would kill them without your Diplomat skill, to take less damage thus heal less on almost every planet, and to get more good results than otherwise possible.</p><p>For me, if my ship has a diplomat (or someone who can become one that game), I'm actually more worried about that person's survival than I am Chun's; that's how very much a diplomat is worth.</p>

                <p>Chao here. Oh boy, I was too hyperactive for my own good!</p><p>I begun monitoring Terrence after realising his AP usage wasn't up to mark. And after he upgraded his drone and got dirty in the process, I knew I had to eyeball him closer. This was further proven when we got the scanner and showed that Hua was at contamination level 2! I made sure to stick by his side no matter which dorm he went, and lucky me. He decided to move around the ship, getting through 6 different locations (I closely tailed behind him so he didn't really know I was actually behind), so as to cover his tracks. I begun punching him whilst he went into the RAS, as I thought he was about to sabotage the oxygen tank (we had only 4 oxygen at that time). Who knew that I would've caught him in the act of sporing in Alpha Bay, which gave me full justifications to finish him off. I was pretty sure he was confused as to how he died, as I was only hitting him once everytime he got into a new room.</p><p>As for Ian, I knew all along that he was the other alpha mush, but it took a little bit of convincing to the mushhunt chat before they admitted it (partly because he was an important character as well). When we had solid evidence that he was the one (Hua got spored when picking up a drone, and the pheromodem showed a scrambled 3 letter word), I sent the word out immediately to the mushhunters. It was a really bad time for me as I knew Ian would only come active when I go offline usually, and we had to come out with a contingency plan fast. I was still all for killing Ian, but was persuaded to complete the serum (which was abt 75% done) and jab it into Ian. Who knew that Finola would've miscalculated, causing Ian to finish the serum and jab into Finola...and the rest is history ahaha.</p><p>My special thanks to Stephen, who was my sole nemesis initially during the early days, but proved to share the same interests in weeding out the mush threat and going onto dangerous expeditions. And not to forget the awesome crew as well! Poor Gioele, he was really confused as to why he died, but we couldn't risk a person who was suspected as mush to barge into an expedition when he was ordered out of it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>All in all, I had a good run as a first time Chao, and it was honestly fun to finish off 5 out of 7 crew members by my hands, with the full backing of the crew behind me <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>And to add on, I had the severe unluckiness to log out and have Chun attack Jin right away. I was gone for 3 cycles before I knew what had happened. By then, the asteroids had already impacted, and we were left with only 20 hull and ~18 hunters on our back. I had to make the call to get us back to Sol as I knew that it would be really hard to tough it out <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>On a random note, I hope Chun reads this and understand this: READ THE THREADS before sticking to your own biased opinions of everything! We were so understanding to you and were trying to guide you, but you choose to stick one up on all of us on so many occasions, and killing Jin was really the last straw. It was really the first time I had so much satisfaction from killing our only hope <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/drowl.gif" alt=":anim_drowl:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Edit: I just realised I have TEN likes from this ship.

                <p>Hello crew! Hua here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>Sorry I had not much time to write here earlier and you all probably gone on other ships already... but maybe some of you will check this AP thread again, so here are my few words:</p><p>It was nice challenge, our ship. No Raluca, no Chun, no Eleesha, Finola was sleeping first two days as well. Later only me as Technician. And Mushes still alive, funny settings to beat <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Bad was, I was on the list. Too many names on it but still... So I was not within the hunt team at the start, I fully understand. I was happy I had a migraine, people will see the log when Janice will cure me - but it passed away right next cycle. So no proof. Then I had to use spore sucker and heal by myself. Was very funny to be careful to do not something stupid <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Poor Gioele, paid for that being on the list as well. Looked to me quite friendly person excited about things he can help with. But be nice is not always enough, like Terrence. His mistake he was trying to lure me for the Pilgred too hard...<br>Special thanks to Chao and Stephen, I loved you guys how you were playing your characters. Another thumbs up to Paola who looked to be playing as Comms officer for first time but did perfect job. My hugs to Janice, Frieda, Roland and our lost captain Jin.<br>Others had less time for play but any word is something and counts. You did all great, real bad luck our Chun was acting like that. We could be still in the space! Well, next time I hope!</p>

                <p>I didn't report her. Honestly I think people are blowing how "bad" she was out of proportion. Where there things she could have done better? Sure. Did she deserve the hostility she got (this was before Jin was killed)? No. She only killed him because people were being excessively mean to her. That doesn't make her killing Jin right but there was fault on both sides.</p>

                <p>Yeah, it is probably difficult to stay calm always. Especially if you think that you are already much more experienced and you think instantly that the other player should do that and that and that better and is ineffective here and there and just not listening to any hint you are giving. But behind each character is a different player and we can't change that player if he doesn't want to change things voluntarily, we can only try and hope for cooperation. And being mean to players could also always lead to hate and killing each other at one certain point in the time or at least to a decrease of the fun you have on the ship. We are humans, of course we have problems with handling of emotions like frustration. Maybe we can learn something from the mushes <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
