                <p>Hi, <img src="http://twinoid.com/img/icons/mush/terrence_archer.png" alt=":tid_mush_tease_TA:" class="tid_ico"> here, I just want to see who was on this ship too.</p><p>The end: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4841" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4841</a></p><p>That was a ship with some people joining because of MMM, maybe around 6. <br>But even more people were doing great! <br>Research was quick and the first mush did only demoralize Janice to death and dismantled the last shower.<br>After that time it was really a challenge to stay clean, we also skipped the convenient sink for the quantum sensors. Around day 5 we were able to cure Kuan Ti, our evidence were that he picked a mycoalarm up with the excuse that he didn't know that mycoalarmns don't work when picked up (now I see that no spore was extracted so I wonder whether he was saying the truth at that point) and because Eleesha found a hidden lense and he was one of the persons in question.</p><p>Then we finished pilgred and we had the luck of getting an astrophysics mage book from xyloph (and a pilot book from xyloph). Our bronze Gioele (one of the best Gioele I have seen, he was also our commander) with coffeine junky got that astrophysics mage book and helped Frieda very much to find us lots of good planets. Andie was on every expedition and the other key which lead us in the end to Eden. Oh, and the last key was of course our beloved stainproof apron, which even got the heroic name Leonidas.<br>Unfortunately we lost Raluca at day 14 due to steel plate and room shaking (and probably starving). <br>Thanks, it was fun!</p>

                <p>Hi <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"> here. This was one of my best ships ever. First Eden and first pregnancy !!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>This was the semi MMM ship that started 1 hour late due to the incorrect timer posted on the forums.</p><p>Stephen's mushiness was very easily taken care off. (He demoralized Janice quite obviously and was killed quite quickly). However, he did take down the 2nd shower and we were left with the kitchen's daily bath and 1 apron.</p><p>Raluca killed Hua and Jin Su early on to rid us from the inactives.</p><p>Paola appeared to be semi-inactive until the time the 2nd (?) rebel base was up. She woke up, got herself dirty before she could decode the rebel base. Looked around the ship (without reading first the posts) that there are no showers. I don't remember what was the issue with the apron and why she didn't use it to begin with. Used up the daily shower that was being reserved for our super active and competent Andie and got dirty again right after!!! This was a big fail on her part and cost her her life.</p><p>Raluca almost had herself killed early in the game by Chun, luckily Terrence and Gioele defended Raluca and saved her life. Without her we wouldn't have made it so far. She geniused the cure and healed Kuan Ti of his mush infection.</p><p>After this Chun became very quiet. It seems she was not prepared for such an active ship. We could have used her help in healing if she was more active in the end and maybe last a little longer.</p><p>Pilgred was finished very fast and from there things were advancing without a hitch. We collected the star map pieces relatively easy. I think we missed on only 2 crystallite zones.</p><p>We ended up the ship with the following stats:<br>Oxygen: Almost at maximum - 10 pots, (2 jumpkin already planted) Tanks were breaking quite often at the end<br>Hull: 100% hull plus 80ish% plasma shield<br>Fuel: about 20 units of fuel, Jar of Alien Oil<br>Hunters were attacking us in big waves on the last day and were getting harder to take care off along with all the steel plating, electrocuting, etc.<br>Artefacts: Alien Bottle opener and Invertebrate Shell (Derek's personal toy)<br>Scrap: 14 -16 of each, capsules, metal and plastic scraps<br>Bananas and alien fruits: we were swimming in those and couldn't eat them fast enough<br>Rations: None</p><p>I want to thank everyone that survived and Raluca for this great journey!</p><p>Andie, you were in character 99% of the time. Great explorer, always present on the expeditions. I wish I could learn from you. You were everywhere, research, expeditions, piloting and providing morale!</p><p>Ian and Eleesha, I hope you succeed in your efforts of making a baby on Eden so that mine can have some friends to play with.</p><p>Ian, you were always there for the expeditions and the plants were always taken care off. I hope you were not annoyed by my constant nagging about protecting the pots <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I just had the experience of losing adult plants in the past.</p><p>Eleesha, you were the best comms manager ever!</p><p>Roland, you were relentless with those hunters and putting out fires. I hope my goodbye gift on the last day did not freak you out too much. I was surprised to see I ended up with 1 glory point more than you.</p><p>Terrence, you provided us with 3 super efficient drones. I think at the end they were all upgraded to firefighters and turbo. Not sure if you started them on the pathfinding yet or not.</p><p>Gioele, Gioele. Our captain, astrophysicist, healer, fixer upper, always there when he was needed. It was an honour to share the bridge with you at the end.</p><p>Kuan Ti, I think you were relatively quiet but you pushed through the projects super fast once you were healed and helped alot with the health of the ship at the end.</p><p>Edited for our Leonidas: The Apron that kept us all clean!!! The most valued item on the ship! It was impressive how clean we all were! Sharing is caring <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I hope to see you all again on another ship !!!</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Chun here! So sorry I was gone late game. Timing and activness didn't cooperate. Was a fun crew, wish I was more inactive, and that Stephen was a human. He had apprentice, and Janice and the shower would have not died. Oh, RNG, why do you do this to us? But we survived... and thrived... with our MANY MANY plants... so many plants... and a 64 year old pregnancy. O.O Would play again with the same crew, maybe with better timing on my part. Will write more later. (was looking for this thread for ages) And with my Raluca killing, I got my tounge bit off, otherwise I would have said something, as I did have some proof, and Eleesha pushed me on. But still, should have gotten more evidence...</p>

                <p>Hm, one point may be the quick research of antispore gas and mushovore bacteria. The other pouint was that Stephen killed janice with the skill demoralize and dismantled the shower. After that incident we stated that everyone should use the stainproof apron for <strong>every</strong> work which can make you dirty. So probably it was for mush even more suspicious now to get dirty. So probably our mush Kuan Ti has decided that he would stay low and not to risk the production of spores.</p>
