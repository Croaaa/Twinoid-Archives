                <p>Hello all, I am Darksteel, and I am officially bored! What say we have a little fun?</p><p><strong><em>Alternate Reality to our prime reality of the Chao/Finola Daedalus</em></strong></p><p>In this reality, the Magellen Ark is completed and launched with a crew and refugees numbering <em>2022</em> and is headed towards Eden. However, with such a large crew, <strong><em>Mush</em></strong> easily infiltrate it, intent to either wipe out, or convert the entirety of the crew.</p><p>Fortunately, of <em>2022</em> passengers aboard the <strong>Ark</strong>, many, many of them are researchers, and are able to combat the Mush rather effectively. Mush make up <em>less than one percent of the total crew.</em></p><p>But... the Mush are crafty. And an employ of many tactics have resulted in the following: The Ark is stranded in space, broken navigation equipment and damaged engines. It has been this way for the past <strong>60</strong> years.</p><p>That, my friend is where you come in.</p><p>You will be taking control of a character of your own design, Mush, Human, it's your choice.</p><p>I'll be the GM for this, so I need you to shoot me a PM with your character details on it, I will decide the events that take place, but you can choose what you do aboard the Magellan Ark.</p><p><strong><em>Rules</em></strong></p><p>The following are the laws my Forum Game universe adheres to, we use typical RNG.</p><p>When you attempt something, eg: Repair the Air conditioning. It is assigned a difficulty, in this case, it is 54<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_eng.png" alt=":mush_pa_eng:" class="tid_ico"> you have a base Tech level determined by rolling a d100 in you character submission. <br>When you attempt something, a second d100 is rolled and added to your base skill, if the combined total is higher than difficulty of the task, the task is successful. in this case, the person attempting the repair has 30<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_eng.png" alt=":mush_pa_eng:" class="tid_ico">, he needs to roll a 25 or higher in order to succeed in repairing the Air Conditioning Unit.</p><p>Combat works a little differently: Your base roll determines both your attack and defense, say your base is 57<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico">, all your attacks have 57 base damage, plus whatever you roll on the instance d100, but you need to pierce your opponents base defense. the remainder is the damage dealt.</p><p>Example Chao has a base <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"> of 100, and rolls a 100 on his d100. thats 200 damage, but the Makarog has a base <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"> of 150 (NPCs can exceed the 100 rule, but where they do, they don't get an additional roll.) The Makarog has 45 HP. Chao one hits the Makarog, because the remainder of the damage he deals versus the defense of his opponent is greater than it's HP.</p><p>The rest of the skills are "job" skills. (These all function similarly, you have a target "HP" that every job has, and your base skill plus a d100 determines how much you complete of it everytime you attempt that task.)<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/demoralized2.png" alt=":mush_pills:" class="tid_ico"> Research skill. (I mean, stuff still needs to be looked at all the time right?)<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_garden.png" alt=":mush_pa_garden:" class="tid_ico"> Gardening skill. (determines how well you can grow the Ark's food supply and Oxygen farm.)<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico"> Mental care skill. (Goodness knows the Ark needs it's shrinks.)<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/sat.png" alt=":mush_eat:" class="tid_ico"> Cooking skill. (self-explanatory.)<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> Physical care skill. (The Medics and Nurses of the Ark.)<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_pilgred.png" alt=":mush_pa_pilgred:" class="tid_ico"> Tech Specialization.* (Those trying to repair the engines and other sensitive equipment require special training.)<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"> Combat Specialization.* (The policemen, explorers and murderers of the Ark. Allows all kinds of fun ways to interact with your crewmates.)<br>More may be added.</p><p>*Specializations add critical chance to tasks, and allow access to special tasks, critical chance is determined by how high the skill is: 20 or below: pick a card, Black Aces win. 40 or below: d20. 60 or below: d12. 80 or below: d10. 81-99: d4. Skill level 100: coin flip.</p><p>If a critical occurs, the task is an automatic success.</p><p>Every time you perform an action that can make you dirty, a d12 is rolled, if the result is 1 or 12 you become dirty.</p><p>You need to PM me your application.<br>Your application should look like this:</p><p>Character name: _____</p><p>Character Bio: (Include what generation your character is: 0th gen are those who came aboard the Ark originally, they can be any age because Cryo. 1st gen are those who were born aboard the Ark and whose parents came aboard on Xyloph-13. 2nd gen are those who were born on the Ark, and whose parents were also.) (Also, a short backstory of your characters life so far.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_eng.png" alt=":mush_pa_eng:" class="tid_ico"> Tech Skill <span class="tid_funTag tid_funTag_dice100">2</span></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"> Combat Skill <span class="tid_funTag tid_funTag_dice100">38</span></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/tip.png" alt=":mush_tip:" class="tid_ico"> Job Skill: <span class="tid_funTag tid_funTag_dice100">46</span> (If you roll under 10 on your Job roll, you are allowed a re-roll.)</p><p>And lastly, weather or not your character is Mush. (This is the main reason you need to PM me your app.)</p><p>So... thems the rules. The goal you have is to reach Eden. (Shocker, I know.) For which you need to recover Star Maps from expos... to do expos, you need the engines repaired... etc.</p><p>Unless you are Mush. in which case, your goal is to stealthily convert and hinder the crew from their job.</p><p>So uh, I guess we can start when we have 5 people. If you have any questions post 'em, (ooc text is to be italicized.) I will post the bios of characters when they are submitted to me. (Or, when I read them to be precise.)</p><p>gl hf! <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>

This includes but is not limited too: Piloting, Torturing, Turret use and Explosives.</p><p>Tech Specialization job skill covers the following things specifically: Robotics, AI (Joint skill with Shrink.), Engine Repair, Reconstruction of lost items and PILGRED work. Note: PILGRED is not the same thing as Engine Repair.</p><p>Critical die, coins and cards are determined by calling the die or coin where applicable. The Characteristic "Twice Critical" allows you to call two options. but in the case of "Pick-a-card" critical type, it allows all Aces to function as a critical.</p><p>Fights between players are discussed in a PM between the disputees and the GM, and in the case of NPCs or inanimate objects. solely between the aggressor and the GM.</p><p>Mush-like actions are also held in PMs between the GM and the Mush taking these actions.</p><p>Once every player has effectively made a "move" the GM calls the results of the actions taken. At this time, the GM will announce any Mush activity that is immediately apparent. If a player is converted to the Mush, or is injected with a Retro-Fungal serum, stats are allowed to be rerolled, but job skills may not be changed.</p><p>Mush have an additional set of characteristics that are not stated with human ones.</p><p>If at any given time, the Mush aboard the Arc are completely wiped out, "A new threat will appear."</p><p>A player may choose to be an alien species.

                <p>You can only edit your post for 5 minutes, or until another person posts. The thread-starter can edit the first post at any time.</p><p>Your new character application should be privately sent to Darksteel in a PM.

This is an awesome idea and I'm looking forward to it! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Just so you know, these RP threads can move very quickly. Fast-paced RP can be a lot of fun, but it can also be hard to keep up with. It can even crash the thread when players bail out because they can't handle the pace. It's not an easy problem to solve... I just wanted you to be aware of it.</p><p>So if it starts to feel like it's moving too fast, you might consider making some rules to keep the pace manageable. An example would be a cool-down between posts - you can't post within X minutes of your last post. Or if you can think of a better solution, I'd love to see it.</p><p>Anyway, I'll make a character this evening. I know a few others who might be interested in joining too, so I'll put the word out. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Regardless of how she chose to display it, she was the perfect citizen, and the greatest Physicist we may ever know."</p><p>Which was all pretty standard fare, but no one could foresee what came next:</p><p>"She did not deserve to be murdered."</p><p>Suddenly the security was all over the stage and Archer was dragged off. A rather flustered Commander Keegan took to the podium.</p><p>"Please excuse Mr Tomescu's outburst, he is merely grieving for his mother, what he says is not accurate. Raluca Tomescu was not murdered."</p><p>But she was. And everyone aboard the ship knew that now.</p><p><strong><em>Missions</em></strong> (A general guideline to direct your Roleplaying within, upon completion of some or most of these, the next episode will start.)</p><p><strong>The Investigative type</strong>: Raluca is dead, and a list of suspects abound, find out the truth behind the great Physicists demise. (Whomever.)</p><p><strong>The Green-fingered type</strong>: Toxicology report on Raluca shows something very strange, a flower, that grows under only extremely moist, humid conditions, was found in her bloodstream. Finding this flower, may be a key to finding the guilty party. (Nilla Anye.)</p><p><strong><em>The Type whom are good with their hands</em></strong>: After the death of Raluca, who was fully against the risk of jumping and attracting hunters to the Ark... well, it's time to get the engines in working condition again. (Augustus.)</p><p><strong><em>For the type who dream of Flying</em></strong>: Metal rich asteroids float nearby, go and collect their bounty to supply the repair of the engines. (Zartha.)</p><p><strong>The Comforting type</strong>: Those who were close to Raluca are in grieving, watch for signs of instability and help them get on with their day-to-day lives. (Takala, HeJuda.)</p><p>Okay, now, let's have some fun!</p>

                <p><em>This is my character bio. I'll post my turn later. Possibly tomorrow since it's getting late here.</em></p><p>Name: Takala<br>Gender: Female<br>Age: 82<br>Generation 0 (no cryo)<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_eng.png" alt=":mush_eng:" class="tid_ico"> 100<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"> 40<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_pmo:" class="tid_ico"> 98</p><p><em>Stats rolled in PM with Darksteel. Yes, RNG loves me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> </em></p><p>Born on the Hopi Indian Reservation, Takala's mother was a Shaman and her father was an Elder. She learned the lore and wisdom of her people and began to walk the sacred path at a very young age.</p><p>Her village was covertly taken over by the Mush when she was 20 years old. Her mother saw in a shamanic vision that The People were possessed by trickster mushroom spirits, and she warned Takala of this shortly before she was murdered.</p><p>Takala fled the village and joined a rebel faction, where she learned the full extent of the Mush invasion throughout the Sol system. She came to believe that the Great Spirit had chosen her to restore balance to the Earth Mother. Her spiritual guidance inspired hope in the rebels.</p><p>Their allies on the Xyloph 17 platform were constructing a galactic ark to carry a remnant of Humanity to a new world, and Takala was chosen as an emissary to join this mission. She then realized that her true quest was to be a midwife to Gaia's rebirth.</p><p>Takala refused the "cold sleep" and chose to meditate in the garden throughout most of the voyage. She keeps a braided lock of her mother's hair inside her sacred medicine pouch, and she claims that the Ancestor Spirits sometimes speak to her and show her visions.</p><p>Within the first few years of the voyage, she bore a daughter, Nilla Anye, fathered by one of the biologists tending the garden. The child was a free spirit, running wild through the ship. Takala gave her nurturing and support, but encouraged her to find her own path.</p><p>Just before the saboteurs executed their plan to destroy the Ark, Takala was shown a vision that guided her in thwarting the worst damage to the critical systems of the ship. She didn't even understand what she did, but ever since then, she's had a keen intuition for the structure and function of devices, and how to repair and improve them. She actually dislikes technology, and gives all credit to the Ancestor Spirits for her uncanny technical skill.</p><p>Takala's eyes sparkle amid her deeply wrinkled face, surrounded by long gray hair. In the tradition of the Hopi, the People of Peace, she is a devout pacifist. Her wisdom is a great comfort to those who seek her solace.</p>

                <p>"<strong>I've been letting lines leak</strong>." Nilla shakes her head as she strides angrily towards the Garden, muttering to herself "<strong>All the extra work that needs to be done, the death of one of our Founders, by covered up murder no less if Archer can be believed</strong>."</p><p>She hardly pauses to pick a discarded piece of plastic up from the corridor as she continues to mutter and march onwards. "<strong>Security, treating him like he was a criminal when he was speaking at his mother's funeral. This ship's corrupt, Keegan's corrupt, the very air stinks. Everything's wrong and I get called on the carpet for -letting the lines leak-</strong>." Nilla growls those last words, her hand clenching around the plastic she had snatched up and trying to crush it to vent her anger.</p><p>"<strong>'Find the leak, Nilla'</strong>" she says in a mocking tone. "<strong>'Take note of any unfamiliar plants growing in the unregulated ecosystem your laziness has allowed to come to exist'</strong>" Nilla suddenly flings the plastic scrap ahead of her down the corridor, it scuds along the floor and ricochets off of both walls before spinning to a stop ahead of her. The motion slows rapidly, as if that spot on the floor had higher friction than the rest of the corridor</p><p>Nilla frowns at the now-still plastic as she continues to approach it. "<strong>Idiot. Head of more idiots. The lines don't leak. Not in the Garden. Never have, I'd never allow that. I watch for that</strong>." Nilla pauses beside the plastic, staring at where it came to stop, then bends to snatch it from the floor, critically inspecting the side that had been down.</p><p>It's wet, faintly, a smear of liquid evaporating even as she watches. Nilla holds it absently, her frown stronger as she takes two steps back up the corridor, following the path the shard had taken.</p><p>There by the wall, a slightly different smell in the air coming from a vent near the base of the wall, and a tiny line of moisture on the floor right under it; streaked out slightly by the plastic shard when it had rebounded off the wall.</p><p>"<strong>Leaking lines? In the -garden-</strong>?" Nilla softly growls the words as she squats to look closer at this aberrant moisture. "<strong>Never. But who's not been doing maintenance here, I wonder</strong>."</p><p>She doesn't bother to glance along the corridor as she pulls a set of tools from her belt and starts to open access for the vent. Whatever leaking lines are along this corridor, it has nothing to do with her responsibilities, even if there should be some sort of strange vegetation growing in the neglect.</p><p>She hesitates only a moment as she feels the unusual warmth in the access panel as she activates it. The panel should have felt slightly cool, but it felt warm. Not hot, not a fire, but wrong to feel warm, warmer than her skin. Everything about this was seeming wrong.</p><p>Nilla stands up a moment, pulling her itrackie from her belt and creating a private channel with the soft command, "<strong>Line to Takala, only</strong>". Now she does glance up and down the corridor as she messages her mother.</p><p>"<strong>Love you, Mom. I've got this week's new conspiracy theory. Access route for Corridor C-9, whoever has maintenance duty has been slacking. Lines are leaking, there's been flooding and the heat system's compromised too. Going to be a right swamp in there, one of those New York alligators will be there too. I'm going to go be eaten by a grue, Mom, just wanted to say I love you first</strong>."</p><p>She decides to wait only a moment for Takala's reply, then speaks again into the itrackie. "<strong>Leaking lines in the garden, Mom. That's what I was scolded for this time. Despite the funeral, despite the murder and how they just dragged Archer off like he had been sneaking around like me. Murder and cover up, and I'm to go recheck my perfect lines Mom. Well, I sure found leaking lines. Think they'll thank me this time, for catching someone else's mistakes? Nah. I'm going to be reprimanded for fixing this instead of re-doing my duty. I bet you a cupcake, Mom, that's how it's going to go. That access panel felt hot, Mom. Corridor C-9, ahh..</strong>."</p><p>Nilla considers the corridor for a moment again. "<strong>About 40 meters aft of junction with P6. In case there really is a grue in here and I need someone in a shining marine suit to rescue me. Time to do someone else's job. Smells like algae. The scum of a grow-pod left open and wet for a week. Love you, Mom, I'm going to get this done now</strong>."</p><p>Nilla turns back to the access hatch, lifting her tools as she leaves the private channel open, in case Takala replies, or she sees fit to scream.</p>

With a grunt, he pushed himself over his seat, lifting the pack of scrap metal and making his way down the hall. He tossed the bag into the pilot bay, the artificial leather skidding across the floor to rest against the far wall.</p><p>Augustus turned, tugging his communicator from a pocket of his work gear. The screen came to life, illuminating the man's oil-smeared face with brilliant emerald light. He tapped the screen, then held it up to his mouth and muttered,<strong> "Oi, Ironwell. Dropped some scrap off fer ya. Get yer ship in order; we're gonna need it soon enough."</strong> He slid the comm back in his pocket, tugged the cap down over his eyes, and lumbered down to the elevator. The whirring lift plunged deeper into the bowels of the Ark, slowing to a stop and opening with a whoosh. The engineering deck was laid out before him, the hum of chatter and faint clinks of metal music to his ears.</p><p>Gus made his way to his assignment, wincing as he found exactly what he'd been assigned. He closed his eyes, swearing softly and placing a hand against his back. With a pop and a crack, he thrust his hips forward, sighing in relief as his spine adjusted. <strong>"Command must be nuts. I ain't that young anymore..."</strong> He paused, eyebrows creasing as he slowly added, <strong>"And with th' scene in th' bays today... Huh."</strong> The engineer knelt down, then dropped to his belly, worming his way into the bowels of the engine he had been assigned. Time to get to work.</p>

                <p>Zathra strode down the corridor, sighing a little as he made his way towards the hanger bay that held the resource collecting vessel, shaking his head a little as he let out a loud, aggravated sigh. He HATED collecting scrap, or minerals, or- Well, using the resource collectors at all. It was so incredibly boring! Just go out, gather stuff, come back. Zero challenge at all. He would have tried to argue about being given this job, but... Not following orders around here tended to end with you getting poked and prodded by scientists for a few hours, and he really didn't feel like going through a full cavity search.</p><p>He peered down at the green glow on his waist, giving a sigh as Gus spoke to him and he brought the device up to his face. "Yes, I know. I'm almost at the bay. I'll let you know when I have the metals dropped off" He pushed the device back into his pocket as he entered the hanger, and he wasted little time getting into the mining ship, opening the cockpit with the flick of a button, and climbing inside before he doing a quick run over of the systems, and closing the cockpit once more. Once he had made sure everything was in working order, he flicked on the engines, and as the vessel lifted up, he left the ark and headed towards the asteroids.</p>

                <p>Karsten Stood in the mid of the Room, among many others, watching the Ceremony and listening to Archers Speech and especially to his last words, wich where clearly not what the Captain wanted. Even while not knowing who wanted what in this play,the Idea that looking into the Events wich lead to Ralucas Death, would be worth some of his time. After all, Raluca wouldn't have been useless while repairing the Engines, more the opposite.<br>As he left the Hall it felt very weired to him. It was just some Weeks ago that He saw Raluca working on The Magellans Engine to complete it and Now many People he knew where either old or Dead and some peoples parents wheren't even Born when he went into Cryo.<br>Instead of returning to the Lab as he planned, he went to the Mourge to look into the Reports for himself.</p>

                <p>"<em>She did not deserve to be murdered.</em>"</p><p>Takala stayed silent, her face unmoving, as the gasps and murmurs spread through the room. She heard the truth in Archer's words, and knew all too well the pain of a mother's murder. Her eyes narrowed as security dragged him off the stage and Commander Keegan rushed in to placate the crew with baseless denial - <em>or outright deception</em>.</p><p>The gathering was quickly dismissed, but Takala remained seated until most of the crowd had cleared. Her old bones were aching, and she didn't want to get in anyone's way. Then she leaned forward onto her cane - a gnarly stick she had taken from a planetary expedition decades ago - and struggled to her feet. A young pilot rushed over to help her, but she waved him off.</p><p>"<strong>No, I'm okay. It just... takes me a bit longer to get going. But you're a sweet lad.</strong>"</p><p>She smiled at him, and her face crinkled up in cheerful ridges that extended out from her eyes like a starburst.</p><p>As she made her way to the door, her Talkie chirped and she heard her daughter's voice:</p><p><cite>Love you, Mom. I've got this week's new conspiracy theory. Access route for Corridor C-9, whoever has maintenance duty has been slacking. Lines are leaking, there's been flooding and the heat system's compromised too. Going to be a right swamp in there, one of those New York alligators will be there too. I'm going to go be eaten by a grue, Mom, just wanted to say I love you first.</cite></p><p>She couldn't suppress a cackle as she fumbled for the device and pushed the button to speak, just as Nilla continued:</p><p><cite>Leaking lines in the garden, Mom. That's what I was scolded for this time. Despite the funeral, despite the murder and how they just dragged Archer off like he had been sneaking around like me. Murder and cover up, and I'm to go recheck my perfect lines Mom. Well, I sure found leaking lines. Think they'll thank me this time, for catching someone else's mistakes? Nah. I'm going to be reprimanded for fixing this instead of re-doing my duty. I bet you a cupcake, Mom, that's how it's going to go. That access panel felt hot, Mom. Corridor C-9, ahh... about 40 meters aft of junction with P6. In case there really is a grue in here and I need someone in a shining marine suit to rescue me. Time to do someone else's job. Smells like algae. The scum of a grow-pod left open and wet for a week. Love you, Mom, I'm going to get this done now.</cite></p><p>She cackled a moment longer and then finally replied:</p><p>"<strong>My dear, you're a basket of maize in the firepit. My lively little girl, I have complete faith in y-</strong>"</p><p>Suddenly she swooned as her sight blurred and she grew dizzy. Sparkles of light swirled around the edges of her vision and became an image of a flower opening up, with its petals dripping in blood.</p><p>A moment later, it was gone, and the nice young pilot was helping her get up off the floor. She leaned against him until she gathered her bearings, and then pushed him away and gripped the Talkie with grim determination.</p><p>"<strong>Nilla! Have caution, my child! A flower-spirit has shown me its hunger, its thirst. Do not become prey to this cunning warrior.</strong>"</p><p>Just outside the door, she saw two guards escorting Archer Tomescu down the corridor, his eyes darkened with a mixture of grief and panic.</p><p>"<strong>...All things are connected, my love. There are no coincidences. Only connections. Your father never understood this. You must <em>always</em> keep your eyes open to the connections. That is how the Great Spirit reveals its Will.</strong>"</p><p>Takala clipped her Talkie back on her belt, and then nodded at the pilot, who was staring at her with a look of confusion and concern.</p><p>"<strong>C-9, P6. She may need your help. Go to her, quickly.</strong>"</p><p>Then she hobbled down the corridor as fast as she could, to catch up with the guards, following them to wherever they were escorting Archer.</p>

When he was done with this, he placed the file exactly where he found it and took a moment to think about this.<br>Appearently the Ships Securtiy had the same suspicion as he and Archer had. Either Keegan was a mush working with the murderer or he just wanted to avoid panic among the people, both options where possibly and it was to early to jump to any conclusions but he would look into DeCruz for sure.<br>RIght now he decided to keep looking for Clues in the Morgue, it would be very likely that the report about Ralucas Death and the circumstances was anywhere around here. As well it would be a nice Idea to contact one of the Botanists, possibly Nilla Anye to help him when he found out wich flower was the mentioned one.<br>With this thoughts he started looking for the Coroners Report about Ralucas Death and any informations about the Murder Weapon, the estimated Time of Death and so on.</p>

You hear someone approach, followed by "Uh, Mr Augustus? I've got your lunch."</p><p><em>Repair difficulty reduced to 677. Lunch get!</em></p><p><strong>Struass</strong>: Upon further inspection, it becomes apparent that the report is being withheld by the Commander, it might be best to check elsewhere for it, a further search of the morgue however, turns up something...</p><p><strong><em>You find Private Morovits, well, what's left of him</em></strong>, his arm appears to have been ripped off, by who or what, it is unknown, but you are able to discern why he was here now, in his hand is a note from someone who has signed as MJS: "Meet me at the funeral home, we need to discuss DeCruz."</p><p>The smell of spores hits you, Morovits was a Mush! You may have been infected.</p><p><em>You found a clue pertaining to the investigation. Roll a d10 if you roll a 6, 7 or 8, you gain a spore.</em></p><p><strong>HeJuda</strong>: You attempt to hug everyone you see, someone reacts to the shock and slaps you. Their is a lot of bustle over in the dormitories as a celebration is being prepared in honour of Raluca, maybe you could help out over there?</p><p><em>You have lost 1 HP.</em></p><p><strong>Zartha</strong>: Even the best maneuvers don't account for other pilots, you are rammed by a harvester ship, and it's Cargo spills into the hangar, causing the ground team to scatter. Your ship has suffered a fair amount of damage and so have you. You dock in the hangar to have your hangar door examined.</p><p><em>You have lost 16 HP, and your vessel is badly damaged.</em></p>

He grinned, worming out from under the heavy machine and getting to his feet. He stretched, grunting as his back cracked and popped, then took the offered food, giving it a sniff. "Thank ya kindly." He nodded, then peered at the engine, muttering, "Figger it's time ta take a break, anyway. Wonder how Ironwell's doing getting me scrap..."</p><p>His communicator flashed to life, the pilot probably not needing another thing to focus on, but... oh well. "Oi, Zath. You got any scrap fer me? Found a part o' the inner conduits that's badly in need o' shielding."</p><p>The man tinkered while he ate, peering at the locket he'd found between the other two jobs.

As the man spoke, Gus nodded, adding, "Didn't know Tomescu too well. She kept ta herself, see. But I got a look at the Pilgred engine, an'... well, let's just say she's more of a genius than they say. Losin' her was a damned blow to th' Ark, and I ain't sure we kin keep goin' without her. Hopefully th' A.I. knows how ta fix this thing if it breaks."</p><p>Gus paused, then rummaged through his pockets. "Enough 'bout death, though, doc. Take a look at this. I reckon ya might know this woman. More'n I would, anyway. Ain't much time fer conversation in the freezer, and I ain't the type for it anyway." He handed HeJuda the locket he'd found, Kuan Ti and a mysterious woman inside.</p>

I'm going to contact security now.</strong></p><p>When this Message was on it's way, he called security with his Itrackie, telling them that he found a dead Mush, beeing private Morovits in the Morgue.</p>

                <p>Huga Steele finally got around to doing something other than mourning Raluca and a blow to his hopes of utopia. Perhaps Huga wouldn't have minded if it was natural or even if it was not a hidden murder but Huga knew something was up and that if there any hope of perfection. He has to find out who murdered Raluca and who is mainly trying to cover this up. Huga decides since he has nothing better to do to go see if he can see Ralucas body and investigate her wounds. Since his days in a hospital helped to figure a knife wound from a blaster wound. Huga asks morgue security if she can see the body to investigate it for wounds <strong>' Security may i see Raluca's body to see if i can get a cause of death to calm this talk of murder down"</strong>. <span class="tid_funTag tid_funTag_dice100">88</span> Huga knew that was a lie but knew that saying that was his only hope of getting in the morgue if he said what i was really looking at raluca for he would never be let in.</p>

[A conversation like this might have happened: "So good! It reminds me of home and my mother, it's exactly what she would have made! Your hired!" "Hired for what?" etc. ]</p><p>Life as a chef was fairly ordinary aboard the vessel, but when the mush fiasco hit everything changed. Food was no longer trusted, or it was baked to a crisp before eating, which didn't make it very appetizing. Jun was hurt they thought him mush, and kept a sharp eye out for anyone who dared mess with his cabinets or kitchen. One day, a fire inexplicably broke out and he had to evacuate the kitchen. Upon his return, he just knew the mush had likely been there, as he was kept out far longer than he would have liked. He couldn't resist taking his father's locket though. He decided then that if this one item was trapped, he might be able to freeze it away, and so, he cryo froze himself. Unfortunately, some automatic protocols have kept him there for a lot, lot longer than he ever intended. [these protocols will unfreeze him next turn]</p><p>Tech: 10 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_eng.png" alt=":mush_pa_eng:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Combat: 84 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Job: 54 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/sat.png" alt=":mush_eat:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anti-Fungal seasoning: Destroys Spores on any food you prepare.</p><p>No Touch-y: You can guard the room your in, making it impossible for anyone to break or contaminate anything inside it.</p><p>Just a placeholder, must wait for this turn to end. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

He knew the guards were trying to cover it up as well. Then a stranger bumped into him as he was walking away. He instantly grabbed his natamy rifle in case it was a pickpocket and the rifle was the only thing he held dear to him right now. Then he turns around and shouts <strong>"watch where you are going"</strong> but, realizes he was talking to the air. He then thinks it must of been the wall when he felt in his pocket and finds a paper in there that wasn't there before. he looks at the paper and realizes he hit the jackpot and find Raluca was poisoned. Huga however, was not familiar with this poison. so he heads to the lab to research the poison more.</p>

                <p>Worried, about the Development of the recent Event and their speed, Karsten looked at his Medlab and then around the lab. If he really wanted to keep finding informations, he needed to know more about The time when the Murderer gave Raluca the Poison, and of course when and how. He moved himself to one of the Computers in a lab wich was in a corner where he could work undisturbed and looked for informations about the flower from wich he was quite sure Raluca was poisioned with. If he found something he had a good spot to find some more evidences.</p>

                <p>Karsten read through both of the Documents and they where equally interesting, both in their own ways. The Report about the Death Lily gave Karsten informations about the Killer, wich was possibly a botanist, and the way how it was done. For him it was easy to see how this Poision could have been mixed into Ralucas Food or Drink and it looked like a relativly small dose was already enough.<br>The Report about the Blaster Energy Conversion was interesting because once once researched it could be a huge help for the whole Arc. But he wondered why it was hidden like that? Did someone wanted to prevent the Researchers from finding it so that the Patrol Ships could not incrase their Power? Or was it just forgotten here? Maybe he would find out, maybe not.<br>As he was fascinated by that Piece of Work, he decided to start working on the Blaster Energy Conversion, once progressed a bit he could ask his Colleagues for help to work on it while he looked deeper into that Murder and possibly it was a good Idea to work a bit. He sniffed around for quite a while now, possibly they would think he did just found Dead ends after all and gave up. Or not.</p><p>Karsten Starts the Research the Blaster Energy Conversion: <span class="tid_funTag tid_funTag_dice100">95</span>+176</p>
