                <p>Chao here. Our ship just ended with a completely inactive Paola waking up on day 5 just a few minutes before the ship was doomed to explode and saving us all with a hacker kit return to Sol. I don't know whether to love her or hate her now.</p><p>Our Mush hunt was over on day 3. Eleesha and Terrence were both very effective at being so annoying we couldn't believe they were mush or they would have tried to get along with us more. Jin Su was a fairly experience player who clearly wanted to be mush and made it happen by going and standing in RC only long enough to be turned. Luckily all 3 were pretty incompetent and we put them to death quickly.</p><p>Then most of the crew went inactive and let the ship die. Kudos to Finola, Raluca, Kuan Ti and Roland who all continued to play and RP up to the end. Honorable mention to Frieda for finding us really great planets, even if she didn't seem all that interested in the ship.</p><p>My main question is who the heck is the player behind Finola. She was an awesome partner for my leather clad Chao. You got what I want forever darlin'... unless you're a guy. In that case, nice work hiding what was under the skirt and let's just say we had a lot of good times. I'll call ya maybe sometime.</p>
