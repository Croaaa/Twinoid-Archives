                <p>Okay, so. I join this ship when about a half of them were awake. I decided I would choose no skills as I was silver and Jin Su is one of those flexible characters that can fill in an important spot if need be. I had jumped with my friend, and fellow TE, <span class="tid_user tid_user_8537534 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8537534">mookat</span>. She ended up being Chao so I knew I was going to have fun referring to her as "my Wang" for a while.</p><p>The ship eventually fills after a day. I realized that a certain key character hasn't spoken up... Janice. Then I noticed Roland had sprinter (but was active). We also only had one tech which was Terrence (he would go on to take Robotics Expert later?). I facepalm and decided I would take the dive and went gold. Leader, Pilot, Shooter, and Logistics. Hua seemed relatively active so I went out to collect scraps. I suggest to Paola that I go up there with her and give her 3 AP a cycle and feed from her own logistic. She happily agreed so I went up and built her sofa.</p><p>Chun wouldn't respond to anything or anyone but moved around the ship while Raluca went inactive in the lab (doomed to die after a day). Finola had wasted all of her AP searching for the sample only for it to have been found by someone else. I wasn't active for that so the time frame made me think she was lying about wasting her AP (to stall research). I'm not the type to move on suspicions and just tucked that piece of information in a file with her name on it, she also took a bed in BD as Ian had taken medlab... She didn't seem to request her bed which made everything look worse.</p><p>Eventually Finola gets her bed and Frieda finds a nice oxygen planet then regretfully had to leave for the weekend and so she went inactive in BD. Stephen was very new and I tried to get him interested through PM and tell him what he should be doing right now... He would go inactive after that in a BD bed (which he would keep all ship).</p><p>Almost a day passes and Paola would get up, finally with a connection, and work on her terminal. As any good hunter on the north end of the ship should, I decided to check to see what all she had done... A few Xyloph... I frown. With 3 AP a cycle I should be seeing golden turds flying from the screen with sweet mariachi playing! I decided I would watch to see if she did it again.</p><p>Meanwhile, BD was a hotspot! Eleesha went through, Kuan Ti went through! Kuan Ti had done a lot though, from projects, to establishing a connection, then relayed a fair few times on research. When he returned to his bed Eleesha "followed" his movements and called him out, saying that him moving through the specific corridors were suspicious. I cock an eyebrow and jump to Mr. Lai's defense. What odd attitude for Eleesha to have, maybe she was just inexperienced at hunting. I shrug... <br>(cont...)</p>

                <p>The next cycle the O2 tank in CBS is reported broken. I knew this because we had finished Anomaly Detector. I'm fairly high on AP and hunters were punted rather recently. At this point I'm familiar with Terrence's partial activity and figured that he wouldn't be on to fix it. Begrudgingly, I move to the storage and fix it, noticing that Eleesha had entered and left with the Diplo book (which she had reported dropping in a dorm). AT the time I wasn't sure if NERON announced sabotaged equipment and I already had her prior odd activities in mind so I decided to ask her why she entered the storage in the first place. She said "the book" but the book wasn't even on astropad. Then she would go on to talk about the blaster in there and how she wants to use it as bait. Eventually I stop questioning her. I didn't like it.</p><p>I went back up to the bridge and decided I would head off to play a game. When I returned at day change I noticed I had already been converted. That's right, there wasn't a camera in the bridge. I had noted early that it wasn't there but I didn't think someone would be this bold... Paola and Eleesha had decided to spike me before and after day change. Naturally, her getting dirty having "eaten" was a red flag to Chao who I had been talking to and telling him my suspicions prior. Now I had to do something about him... I explained that she had done a fair bit (even though she hadn't). He didn't seem to buy it, luckily for us he had played a game of leap frog with inactive Janice earlier (he threw her out of a dorm because she had a bed).</p><p>I quickly devise a plan to turn Chao at Day 4 change. We would go to Frieda's planet for oxygen and Eleesha would grab infector. Then we will triple spore Chao in IB. When day change neared, Chao never showed up. I had to think of something else but one thing was certain, he needed to be dealt with and soon. When day change came around I grabbed defacer and Eleesha and I invaded Bravo Dorm, turning Chao. From what Chao said, we chose a good time because he was already planning to murder me, having suspected I was a beta after Paola's getting dirty.</p><p>Now there were 4 of us. The Alphas said they really wanted to turn as many humans as they could. Who was I to deny them their plans? I lost as a human by their cunning, it wasn't my place to take over. While they did let me do the planning, I always made sure they had final say. Nothing is more frustrating being an Alpha when you go through the risks of making a Beta and they don't want to take the course that you've been working hard on.</p><p>It was quiet after... save for me screaming at the crew to go on an expo with me. Eventually Ian did. It was just us 2 tackling a 9 zone planet with forests winds and a bunch of different temps. I even got sick in one of the forests but Ian didn't seem to ask about it afterwards. I obviously withheld the expo results from the crew who didn't even seem to ask about them.</p><p>When I got back from the expo I was messaged by Kuan Ti. He had noticed the defacer and was investigation who had moved during the time. He had messaged me a bit too early, though and he suddenly noticed that I was a suspect as well. He said he didn't think it was me and apologized then took this information to the <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/WPthuQj.png?1">public</a>. I explained to him why it was a bad idea that he went so openly public and that he risked causing a rampage. He came to the conclusion that it had to have been Eleesha. Fearing that some of the crew may grow violent to my alpha, I began trying to leave the seeds of <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/uf8qIBO.png?1">doubt</a> in the crew. Even if Kuan Ti didn't believe it, it may at least get him to hesitate long enough for me to formulate a plan. <br>(Cont...)</p>

                <p>My Wang eventually returned, surprised to find he's mush. I told the Alphas that I expected Kuan Ti to notice the defacer. I told Chao that a possible plan was for HIM to also grab defacer, use it on the dorm and beat Mr. Lai to death. If you had seen this crew you'd probably understand that nobody would probably notice the extra dead blip in the crew bar. Chao didn't feel comfortable taking this method and I eventually backed off. I went to sleep that night hoping that Kuan Ti wouldn't do anything foolish.</p><p>Next day I notice Hua is still outside from attacking hunter. We had a huge group of hunters now so I had no choice but to leave her behind, despite the day of warning I gave her. Kuan Ti had not acted, either. We were going to have until C1 which is perfect. I wrote up a plan... Eleesha would grab gold (thank you for supporting the game!) and grab transfer. She would remove the camera in AD, leave and spore, then return and spike Terrence (their only tech). She'll then replace the camera and transfer into Terrence. Chao would then come and murder Eleesha (as Kuan Ti had threatened him to do it the other night). Meanwhile, Terrence and myself would approach BD and I would defacer it then we would turn Kuan Ti much the same way as Chao. Initially we had planned just to rush Terrence with defacer. Given Mr. Archer's activity level, we decided we needed one of ours in that juicy tech body.</p><p>Now there were 5 of us. Armor was roughly around 30-40 now. I had to keep the ship in transit to avoid most of the damage. We needed to rush Pilgred and we needed to do it soon. We decided we would wait until the next day.</p><p>That night, Finola came online and noticed my message demanding the crew to go to BD for a speech. She had later <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/gvkuo6o.png?1">messaged</a> me. She had noticed the defacer, I kind of expected it as well. What I didn't expect was for everyone think it WASN'T me. I explained to her that there might've been a transfer but that I couldn't do anything even if I wanted to. I told her that Mr. Lai and I have been discussing a tactic (we hadn't). That seemed to have pacified her for the time being... Another loose end I'll need to handle tomorrow...</p><p>Next day rolls around and Terrence seemed ready to get working. Nobody was on to help him yet but he rolled his sweet ass to Pilgred where he will wait. Finola came back to me again... <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/xDSFNMT.png?1">demanding</a> action. I knew I wouldn't be able to avoid it but she seems to have thrown in a wild card... I decided to <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/RTMVPFM.png?1">play off of it.</a> I had managed to get her to agree to <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/erkkchc.png?1">kill Frieda.</a> The next cycle, Frieda was dead. I had initially planned Chao to kill Finola after she killed Frieda but after talking on the public chat I figured that she was out of AP (and possibly gun shy) and wouldn't be a problem. Kuan Ti came on to help Terrence with Pilgred, also taking Gold to grab technician (Thank you for supporting the game too!)</p><p>They both worked hard and it came down to required one more person to relay him. I rush down to the engine room and relay Pilgred. Terrence would finish it right after. I ran back to the bridge and pushed the Sol button right quick! We won... With only 14 armor. We had saved the Daedalus from its horribly boring fate. That's why, we were the Responsible Mush.</p><p>~Fin~<br><em>Bows... Bows again.</em></p>
