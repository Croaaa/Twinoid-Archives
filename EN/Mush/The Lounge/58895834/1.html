Ended as mush Eleesha.<img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>First days I made my usual torturer things. Like torturing people, torturing and sometimes torturing.<br>My mistake was to let all know what am I doing. Mushes were suppressed by my activity and did nothing mushy. But what choice did I have? Always dirty, never helped in lab, walking around. Suspicious as hell. So I had to explain what am I doing.<br>But Stephen and Roland trusted me and it was ok.<br>All changed at D5. We had planet to visit, Stephen told me he made machine gun and dropped in Icarus with grenade. I was in FC with KT. My goal was to check if he was starving and to go to Icarus after it. I felt safe, there was alarm here. Suddenly 2 load BRRRING near, wellcome to mush. Gio converted me. At the same moment Ian (second alpha) took anonymush.<br>Only 2 targets in FC. KT and me. Risk to be revealed is too high.</p><p>I decided I should rampage. I came to Icarus, took grenade, machine gun and blaster. Came ot BD where both Roland and Stephen located. They are most active and useful here so I decided I should kill them. Gio was here too but I it was ok, he was ready to take his part in this show. I did deface, used grenade and started to shoot. Old Faithful was good enough to finish Stephen but Roland managed to escape.<br>I had no WT, couldn't see logs, I didn't know who was killed and who was not so I returned to Icarus for it to get last news.<br>I was sure I am primal suspect but I managed to persuade them it was not me who did deface there but Gio (who was already dead by this time from Eleesha's hand). I told I came to kill him as soon as I saw alarm.<br>Roland told I shouldn't move or I will be killed. Ok, I got it, I am still suspect.<br>What can I do? No ap or mp. Can't get ap from beds, from food. They will reveal sooner or later. So, next step.<br>Eleesha had start spore. She in dorms. Awesome.<br>The plan was to make my health low before cycle change, transfer to Eleesha right after it and kill my body.<br>Reality. Over 30 times I took and dropped blasters and ropes Icarus. No. Didn't lose health at all. RNG gods hate me as usual. Never mind. Let's do it.<br> <br>I found Eleesha in BD. Alone. I had 1mp only and no WT. Ok, transfer. Enough ap. I took machine gun and started to shoot. Missed most of the times. But she got a couple of bullets. One smashed her feet. Nice. But I am ready to die. She will start alarm. She was online, I noticed she opened channel with me but closed. But she can't do anything. No ap to act. No mp to move. No WT to tell crew about me. I could feel her despair. But no skills so any smart person would see it.</p><p>Janice came. Chao was suspect. Janice finished him (<strong>always check skills of your target</strong>, people<img src="../../../../gfx/square/chart.png" alt=":chart:" class="tid_ico">). Human. Janice tried to accuse me as transfered mush. I managed to make them think she is wrong. I made a story about stupid Chao who wanted to have all the glory and that is why he didn’t tell anyone about mush Gio and attacked mush instead. And later Finola’s list proved Chao was human. So they didn’t push me. And the best part of it - nobody asked why did Chao make sooooo many pick up and drop actions in Icarus. Roland only asked about grenade which was taken by Chao and disappeared somewhere. I just ignored this question, and they didn’t ask again. And this question was important enough<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Also Eleesha’s activity (she left less than 10 messages at all) helped me to act like her easily after transfer. Less talking, more silent moving around.<br> <br>Next day we just waited and did nothing suspicious. I walked around the ship trying to find tech book humans hid somewhere. And I found it on D7. After Terrence killed Roland for nothing (very stupid move) and humans killed Terrence, I realized it is all done for humans. So I used the tech book just in case. No more techs for human team.<br> <br>And after it, 15 min before ship was destroyed, Ian transfered to inactive Jin Su and attacked humans with my help. We managed to finish only Janice but it meant nothing at this point. Humans lost.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"><br> <br>I like the way Stephen and Roland played (that is why I started to kill hem first after I become mush), Finola was fine too. Chun was bad, really bad. Ignored me in pm, never did any investigation, not the way Chun should act. Terry was just russian roulette player, he killed 2 humans just because he liked to kill. And Hua just played her own game.</p>
