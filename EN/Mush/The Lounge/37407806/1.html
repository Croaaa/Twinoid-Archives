Thanks for the awesome trip, it was really something. I'll add my rendition of the whole experience eventually but for now here's an appetizer for what when on during the first 7 days of the ship as written through my general announcements. (only days 3-7 since I lost the second one it seems).</p><p>-<br><strong> Pre-day 3 announcement </strong><br> <br>Great work on everyone so far for being alive and doing their respective jobs! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> <em>(well most of you anyway)</em>. Things got a bit heated yesterday and we lost Kuan Ti who was unfortunately human, but hopefully they'll get sorted out throughout the course of day 3.</p><p>:pa_core: <strong>Research</strong> :pa_core: is going well as are the :pills: <strong>projects</strong> :pills: . Getting armored corridors done in a day isn't something you expect on most random ships. <br> <br>For day 3 I expect another of the anti-mush research completed and some work into <strong>planet scanning</strong> done, so that we can start making plans for an awesome expedition. Remember to also set up the sofa at the bridge so I can relocate there and get the medlab camera moved to the aforementioned area.<br> <br>Remember, that the medlab is still currently off limits to everyone besides <strong>Chun</strong>, <strong>Finola</strong> and me and to stay under the watchful eyes of the cameras in the dorms.<br> <br>Lastly, something I'd like to bring to everyone's attention is the fact that my father, <strong>Gioele</strong>, seems to be paralyzed with grief and might possibly die today or tomorrow. Please let his death occur naturally and as morbid as it sounds I hope he ends up being mush as it's one less problem to worry about.<br> <br>Paola over and out.</p><p>-</p><p><strong> Pre-day 4 announcement </strong><br> <br>Another day has gone by and everything seems to be going well. Crew members are getting along and besides those few mess ups I can't really complain. Especially considering the fact that we have a mush dead by day 3. Honestly eleesha , even a blind person would have noticed. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"><br> <br>I'd like to personally apologise to <strong>Frieda</strong>, whom I believe has been receiving the short end of the stick when it comes to resting and finding planets but hopefully that will change tomorrow once gioele is dead and you can take your rightful place here with me at the bridge.<br> <br>Day 4 will be your time to shine <strong>Frieda!</strong>. As I hope to see a planet found with oxygen and perhaps a few other useful zones such as planets and for Jin Su to point us in that direction. However be sure to get this done <strong>BEFORE</strong> <em>cycle 8</em> as if you move the ship during that cycle or the ones after it (if I haven't established a connection with the base yet) we will lose that base forever. I really don't want that to happen as I plan to connect to all of them.<br> <br>As for the <strong>research</strong> and <strong>projects</strong> I expect to see those sprinklers finished by the end of the next day and perhaps 1 more anti-mush research done. Don't push yourself too hard though and be sure to co-ordinate to maximize efficiency!<br> <br>On the other hand I <em>personally</em> will be working on a few more of those databases entries so expect a few disconnections with sol, which I'll need your help re-establishing a connection to. I'll try my best to get the day 4 base done too but I'm not making any promises.<br> <br>A special shout out goes to <strong>Chao</strong>, who slew the evil beast put a wrench is the mush's plans. You did a good job! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"><br> <br>This has once again been Paola.<br> <br>Over and out.<br>-<br><strong> Day 5 announcement </strong><br> <br>One more day behind us and boy have things been interesting yesterday. It seems that our last mush :mush: has been found, it was <strong>IAN</strong> the whole time. Now before you get your murder fists ready to deliver your just deserts, I'd like to bring to your attention that <strong>IAN</strong> spored and transfered into <strong>TERRENCE</strong> and then cowardly made his way towards the Pasiphae and flew off. Please ignore anything <strong>TERRENCE</strong> says as it's all just mushy lies from this point onwards.<br> <br>Congratulations to <strong>Frieda</strong> for finding us a good planet which although it didn't have any oxygen, it seems to have been composed entirely of meat since we got a whopping 16 whole steaks. Great job to the expedition crew too. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"><br> <br>Unfortunately due to current circumstances we had to murder <strong>Jin Su</strong> since he wasn't active enough and we need to move the ship ASAP to get rid of that mushy plague. This will be handled by <strong>chao</strong> next cycle (D5C2).</p><p>Moving on to today's plans. The priorities are as follows: 1. Finding a planet with <strong>oxygen</strong> and doing an expedition. 2. Fixing pilgred enabling us to escape if things get too bad. 3. Finishing the project and getting some pilot beneficial research done. 4. <em>(personal)</em> Get a few more databases done to hopefully some helpful magebooks and blueprints to replace our losses.<br> <br>This is the time for us to rejoice for the mush will soon be eliminated then we can just sail smoothly to eden. Keep up the good work everyone and keep fighting the good fight!</p><p>This has once again been <strong>Paola</strong>, Over and out.<br>-<br><strong> Pre day 6 announcement </strong><br> <br>At long last our attempts at purging the mush from this ship have succeeded! Both mush are now finally dead and with that, unless there's an anonymush lurking about, we can celebrate! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"><br> <br>I'd like to once again congratulate <strong>Frieda</strong> and the expedition crew for finding a planet with 02 so quickly and hitting another mother load of steaks. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/drowl.png" alt=":drowl:" class="tid_ico"><br> Thanks to your collective efforts we should have more than enough rations for the rest of journey.<br> <br>Furthermore, <strong>Raluca</strong>, you did a fantastic job on pilgred. Working on it and the projects at just the right pace for us to have pilgred finished by day 5. We might not have the plasma shield yet but i'm sure we'll get it soon. UNLIMITED COFFEE WORKS is now available at the refractory once per cycle. I kinda wish my dad was here to enjoy it though... :c<br> <br>Anyway, since the mush are now dead the next priority would be making preparations to eden. This will require more hard work from <strong>Frieda</strong> to find us<br> some nice planets with the likelihood of alien artifacts. We only need 2 more star map pieces which means eden is in our grasp as long as we don't upset the RNG gods.<br> <br>Lastly, I still expect projects and research to go along at a steady pace but I doubt you need any more reminding of that, considering how well you're doing so far.<br> <br>May we successfully reach eden!<br> <br>Paola out.</p><p>-<br><strong>Day 7 announcement </strong><br> <br>Six days behind us and now things are so quiet around here I kinda miss the mush keeping things interesting. Although there's always something to do on the ship, whether it's partaking in projects,research, dealing with hunters, scanning planets, tending to plants,fixing pilgred or going on expeditions.<br> <br>We were cutting it close the last expedition and we almost lost an important member of the team but thanks to the valiant efforts of the expedition, they managed to persevere and we didn't loose anybody.<br> <br>Great work to the project crew too who managed to get us a few more excellent projects, one being the extremely helpful sensors and the other being the blaster guns. This increases our chances of survivability that the silly mush thought they had reduced to nothing.<br> <br>Lastly, I'd like to apologise for not posting is announcement earlier as I had to go to bed and forgot about it and as for me I'll do my best to get us a 5th Neron upgrade along with the final base today. I'm also thinking that the 5th upgrade will be my last as it's getting quite AP heavy and I'd rather not waste AP that could go to other places such as research.</p><p>Keep up the good work!<br>Paola.</p><p>-<br>Finally we have the expeditions of to give you better insight of the experience we had.</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4749" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4749</a></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4752" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4752</a></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4784" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4784</a></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4785" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4785</a></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4817" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4817</a></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4855" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4855</a></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4930" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4930</a></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4934" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/4934</a></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/5022" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/5022</a></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/5026" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/5026</a></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/5059" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/5059</a></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/5069" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/5069</a></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/5070" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/5070</a></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/5116" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/5116</a></p>

                <p>I was Hua. This was an excellent crew. It really looked like our fate was sealed when lp91 took off with the pasiphae and extinguishers. But the RNG smiled upon us after accepting Jin Su as a sacrifice and provided the extinguisher bp. This is a great example of why you should never give up.

                <p>Behold, it is I, CHAO! Seriously a great ship, would kidnap and woo Finola again!</p><p>Finola/Chun/Paola really showed what a hardcore research/comms crew can do in the early stages. That will be a hard standard to live up to in future games. We had 3 anti-mush techs by day 2 it felt like. Special thanks to Finola for all those quiet evenings together keeping our morale up as well as being truly hardcore about researching.</p><p>Mush Ian was well played. He almost died and convinced us to stop killing him. That part was truly epic. He definitely did quite a bit of damage stealing the Pasiphae and our extinguishers as well as doing a poor job with the plants. He didn't have much help from Mush Eleesha though.</p><p>Sorry Jin Su, you had to die. We needed to move the ship and you were just too slow or AFK.</p><p>Old Terrence / New Ian - Great job overall even though you got Transferred. Too bad we didn't get a chance to use the Jumpkin</p><p>Hua and Stephen were just machines, killing Hunters, putting out fires, and generally being pro league crew members.</p><p>Frieda, Janice, and Raluca were a bit quiet but in the end they did a ton of work and made the ship successful despite not being 24/7 super Mush nerds like the rest of us. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Special award to Gioele for being the only truly inactive on our ship. Hang in there buddy, the game is pretty fun if you give it a chance.</p><p>Hope to sail with you guys again soon!<br>- I, CHAO</p>

                <p>Sorry you got killed DAM091, it wasnt personal, and it wasn't Chao acting alone. It was a group decision. At the time we were very short on oxygen and to us it looked like you were logging in maybe once a day, dont forget that the command title transferred between you and Chao a couple times in the prior days when you kept going inactive. We decided we had to move the ship asap to get oxygen, and to kill the mush before he could come back aboard and cause more damage. We could not afford to wait for you to come online or go inactive again. We had to act for the good of the crew.</p><p>As I said Im sorry we had to do it, but I do feel that we made the correct decision. I would honestly be surprised if Draxon gets a sanction for this and I certainly dont think its deserved.</p><p>If you are only logging in once a day I would suggest that you do not select Jin Su. Its not uncommon for barely active Jin Su's to get murdered even if they are human (there really should be a warning when choosing him).</p>

                <p>Actually, I agree, to the extent that I think Jin Su should never be an option for Bronze players. While that may seem harsh, and being in gold/silver mode doesn't guarantee activity, it certainly is much more likely.</p><p>That being said, I disagree that I was that inactive. It's been a while, but I'm pretty sure I only lost the title once, early on. Why didn't you just use the hacker kit to move the ship? If you're in a hurry, that's certainly a more viable option. Wasting all the AP to kill me and then waiting a cycle for the title to change can't be easier and quicker than the hacker kit. And the fact that you had to kill me to switch the title shows that I wasn't completely inactive at the time.</p><p>I'm still putting in my report. If it goes anywhere, Chao can plead his case that the rest of you were just as responsible. The mods can check the logs and make their decision. Sorry, it sounds like this was a fantastic ship, and though I don't want to be a dark cloud on it, I also don't think it was fair that I was deprived of my opportunity to enjoy it.</p>

                <p>Haven't seen anything yet, but it was a group decision. Your position is understandable so we'll see what happens. I think we were in our rights. You had proven to be inactive at least once, O2 was dropping, and there was a Mush saving up AP probably to return to the ship and cause more damage.</p><p>I don't actually recall what happened with the hacker kit and Chun but I feel like we might have talked about it. It was probably a case of you were probably inactive and Chun wasn't around or had no AP. The Hacker kit is crazy low success for most people isn't it? (I've never used it, don't think I've even picked it up!)</p><p>Sorry you missed a great ship, I would be pissed too.</p>
