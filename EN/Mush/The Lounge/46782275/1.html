It was fun to command you (at least in RP). The mush part was really easy, Raluca blew names on mush chat and we had our researches done REALLY fast.. in sleeper mush mode, i quess it would be better to just lay low before they all wake up and then coordinate action..</p><p>We cured Ian who then told us names of remaining mush, so it was easy to deal with others. It was important cure not only because of mush hunt, but because Ian played major role in our D32C2 long trip. With pheromodem, we were just waiting who the last alpha will be. Poor Chao woke up in the role where his every mushy step was seen in pheromodem, so he decided to go on rampage and kill our pilots. He manager to kill Terrence and Roland, which didnt really matter at the start as we were doing fine, but if we had them, we could have reached even further.</p><p>Even with few pilots (full time Frieda after we found 3rd fragment, half time me with giving speeches and less then halftime Hua with her plants and technician), we managed to do really great. The main problem in the end was lack of techs, as our only tech was Hua (while she was also doing huge piloting part) and inactive Kuan Ti. Too bad Eleesha didnt pick her tech as 4th skill as she promised and went to inactivity as well.. without techs, our ship looked like <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/eiA0qlh.png">this</a>. and it was the bright time when we didnt have almost all patrollers broken <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> having both the O2 tanks broken every single cycle seemed like a big problem even with so many jumpkins (this couldve been avoided if necessary with expeditions on which we didnt go as it wasnt needed and there were no spare APs). It was fun to count charges on every patroller which was at least half empty because of the constant broken state - even with so few pilots.</p><p>Our decision to end the voyage and fly to <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eden1.png" alt=":mush_eden_1:" class="tid_ico"> came from the lack of jumpkins, which were keeping Ian and thanks to him whole crew alive for such a long time. We could have hold few more cycles i think, by just jumping from hunters, but those who stayed awake during night had to get some <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/laid.png" alt=":mush_laid:" class="tid_ico">. Those 2 hours cycles are insane during late game.</p><p>I hope my two children will enjoy their life in Eden <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eden1.png" alt=":mush_eden_1:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I think the following list pasted from endscreen sums how great it was <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"> :<br>You spent the night with Frieda.<br>You spent the night with Chun.<br>You did the thing with Eleesha.<br>You flirted with Janice.<br>You spent the night with Hua.<br>You did the thing with Frieda.</p>
