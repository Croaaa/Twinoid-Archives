                <p>Hi, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/terrence.png" alt=":mush_terrence_50:" class="tid_ico"> Terrence here, the crewmember of <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6211">this Daedalus</a>.</p><p>The game began quite funny. I wake up as first and the only thing I did was dismantling shower in Alpha Dorm as well as instaling camera there. I looked up to NERON who left the camera and the wrench in Front Storage, just on the way. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But I accused NERON of not waking up people from CryoModule. Really, 6 hours alone exhausted for hunters outside was annoying.</p><p>The ship was filled in the middle of day 2. After finishing NERON Participation I made Fire Detector alone and, as I had to go and I was in corridor when it was told so I relayed PILGRED 3 times instead of doing comms (it was so far), reported my dirtyness and went sleep (really, sleeping dirty, a bit suspicious right?) I didn't investigate because of being invalid, I thought crew would do instead. I just looked at logs where I was to look at suspects.</p><p>No inactive, uh... at least later. Chun was quiet, she hasn't talked anything since start and stayed whole the time in the Lab. Andie I don't know what this person did whole the time. Roland was Sprinter, Stephen and Jin Su admitted to play first, Jin Su was a troll, joking about being Mush, hit Raluca a few times and stayed there at cycle change demoralizing her, stayed all the time in corridors/bays. Eleesha and Derek killed them. Eleesha was inactive in first day, when she got inactive, since a few minutes later she's been active. She didn't have any skills at start, as we knew. She hit Jin Su and stayed in the Medlab. She attracted some suspicion being dirty. Temporarily I was interested in her. Why did she get dirty? I didn't know she'd hit Jin Su. PILGRED? Not - I checked. Research - not, gardening - probably not, but she hit Jin Su several times. My power disappeared just there.</p><p>About the rest of crew: Paola was quiet, but did her work, we had nice gold 4lvl Gioele who assumed the commander, gold 4lvl Frieda (she had just 2lvl before Mush selection) devoted in piloting and astronavigation, gold 5lvl Kuan Ti, who's speeches made me as much happy as possible in the beginning, Janice gold 3lvl, the best on RP (really annoying person, trust me) as well as Raluca who helped in projects after PILGRED was quite high, Ian, who was ianctive in the beginning, but claimed the Medlab bed and took care of research, and Hua, who wouldn't get dirty, but nicely did her work at piloting.</p><p>Even Stephen played well as for new player. So we had great half of crew, able to do everything. Anabolics helped me a lot, but our gardening was poor, 2 banana trees on day 3, no bananas because nobody watered them. Anyway we had no problem with oxygen because of 3 astrophysicist, although first planet we visited had seismic activity.</p><p>The game likes to surprise. This day, when I annoyed my movement and my fail to show up Eleesha, I came to Dorm to wash myself because Ian wanted to finish MycoAlarms, to make our first expedition available. Jin Su was nice helping me with movement staying in Front Corridor, when I could roam between the Lab and the Bridge for free. Now, I decided to go to the Lab through the Medlab. Ian and Eleesha were there. I just saw this crew very passive, they couldn't kill anyone, I saw it. MycoAlarm finished, Ian took one of them back to the Medlab, I brought one to Bravo Dorm, going through the Medlab. I had one free slot and I didn't want the crew to walk around the ship to take MycoAlarm in the front and put in the back. And next cycle, Eleesha reported her illness. She's got Fungic Infection, healed later. Ian taught us that it's caused my direct infection (via Twinpedia), he told us that Terrence, Stephen, Gioele, Derek and Ian. I claimed that Ian couldn't do this because he hadn't been dirty and in Bravo Dorm. How to clear myself? I asked Eleesha when she'd got the illness, and it was 9 hours before, so I couldn't be the reason, cleared myself. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Stephen, Gioele or Derek. One of them must be Mush. Eleesha printed the LIST (why?) and told us the people on the list: Jin Su, Stephen, Gioele, Derek, Kuan Ti. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> It didn't help us. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Stephen looked like newbie as well as Derek, so if they're Mush, someone experienced must have been Mush. I had the most suspicion at Gioele because he looked more experienced. He was taking coffee from Refectory, but my movement didn't allow me to check what he did. He was too experienced for me. Stephen looked much more experienced as new player, Derek didn't eat upon killing Jin Su, he even went through Medlab to get between Front Corridor and Bravo Dorm, but it wasn't shortcut. I suspected Derek and Gioele, focusing on Eleesha.</p><p>First expedition, yay. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Hua ran there immediately, I hid the MycoAlarm in her presence, waiting for expo. Gioele ordered Janice to chance Crew Lock because he didn't want to waste pilot AP on launching. He also wanted trusted person to hold the Hacker Kit, Frieda did so. He waited for Frieda because she was survivalist and she was needed at expo. He wanted Ian as well, and I was there. But wait... something is wrong. Frieda taking Hacker Kit to expo, Gioele commander on the ship, transfer or he Mush loading fuel and leaving us on the planet... piloting unlocked, so Patrol Ship launching available... oh no Gioele. He came with us. Some stuff happened, I gave up expedition, so they did without me, but there was Derek, so I warned Frieda to be careful with Hacker Kit, because Derek might have sacrifised for this. Frieda left the Hacker Kit in Alpha Dorm, they launched. We've got some oxygen, Seismic Activity didn't work (Gioele, why didn't you jump there?).</p><p>Fuel wasn't loaded, so Gioele couldn't move. Janice asked me for MycoAlarm, if it's in the Refectory because of Derek who did something there, I confessed that I put just in Icarus Bay. Frieda hacked into system, left orbit, next cycle a low amount of hunter appeared, destroyed us in the next.</p><p>Gioele, don't treat me as enemy, I had too short legs to get you. Do you choose these people as me? Janice, Gioele, well played Mush. Eleesha, if she could investigate, maybe she'd notice if room shaking was really in Alpha Dorm then (excuse of getting hurt by Gioele). Janice, I was really curious why you were sure Jin Su was human, no evidences, no reason, amongst suspects, I was interested in you, until this Fungic Infection. Treacherous illness. You really wanted to hold this ship, human or not. I was silver, but stayed as technician. I wanted to do many projects, I didn't want to be a pilot, being the target of Mush by trapping bays, and be finished like Frieda. Gioele played well as Solid-Paranoid-Caffeine-Astrophysicist, but if I had my legs, I'd get you. The crew was too passive, and you could feel relieved.</p><p>Oh, Eleesha and Ian... congratulations baby. Was it infected? Eleesha human, but still carrying spores. We'll never find out, it's in thousand pieces in the space. Eleesha, you could save us. 3 technicians, we'd get PILGRED in 5 minutes and get to Sol, if not Mush.</p>

Is it true?<br>If she wanted to lie to confuse me more, I wouldn't believe she was Mush. I pretended to be bronze because no additional skills I wanted to use. She may not have wanted to upgrade her character. Survivalist would be best for Mush.</p>

She was the only one who had 16 HP on the expedition team. I believe that means she is gold. By then Hua already picked Botanist as her 2nd skill.
