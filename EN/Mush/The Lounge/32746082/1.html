                <p>Thank you guys for the ship, it was a nice starting ship for me, although there could have been a bit more communication <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>I played Finola and the first days were quite uneventful the Mushs did nothing noticeable and well I tried to coordinate some things, but because it was my first ship I did not have got that much experience in the beginning. I concentrated on researching projects with Chun who was a big help <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>On day 3 the ship became more exciting, because we were losing much oxygen and when I checked the Alpha Storage Room I found a broken tank and in the log the confirmation for one of our suspicions of being a Mush. Fortunately I managed to fix the tank with 2 AP but we had already lost much oxygen :l</p><p>I also saw in the log that another player had checked the Alpha Storage Room around 30 minutes before me and because this player was quite active and also helpful until this point I suggested that he is a Mush because he did neither report the broken tank in the chat nor tried to repair it. So I created a private chat with all the other players and told them about my suspicions.</p><p>The next day I attacked Paolo and managed to deal 4 hits. Shortly after that Stephen was also coming to the room and managed to kill her and we have been right she was a Mush. Now Stephen grabbed the knife that have been in the inventory of Paola and also managed to kill Jin Su who also was a Mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>Quite a cooking killer that Stephen, he said that a cook know how to wield a knife <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Unfortunately they managed to infect another player before we could kill them, but we also had another big problem.</p><p>The oxygen was down to 8 points because of the broken tank on the day before. Because we had no choice I tried to organise an expedition on a not analysed planet. Fortunately somebody managed to analyse it before we started, but it was not a perfect planet (moutains, desert, hot zones, seismic) but well because we would die because of the lack of oxygen anyway we started the expedition with Kuan Ti, Eleesha and me. It was a success but unfortunately we did only find some fruits and no oxygen :/</p><p>I had 10 HP left and suggested to do another expedition shortly after the first one because we had nothing to lose <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Well we started another one and me and Ellesha died on that one because of some accidents on the expedition.<br>It was no problem for me because we had only 4 oxygen left at that time and would have died soon even without the expedition^^</p><p>Later I did see in the log that this expedition killed the whole ship because the loss of 6 moral points because ellesha and me died. At the next cycle 3 people died because of fatal depression (2 of them were inactive) and during the night the rest of the ship died (also our hull was down to ~45 and 15 hunters were attacking).</p><br><p>So thank you for the ship and maybe we will meet again on another ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> (I'll be starting on the sunday noon jump)</p><p>Edit: I read the log again and it seems like Paola and Terrence have been the starting Mushs (and Terrence was completely inactive^^) and so Jin Su has been just turned before we discovered that he is a Mush.</p>
