                <p>Hi, this is Eleesha speaking. Oh my Gosh I loved this game but I hated. First time being Eleesha, and most people knew the game pretty good so I was like "they're good at hiding trails and I can't find the mush!" then it was like "mush must be inactive!" (darn raluca and terrence! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">) There was a time I sincerely suspected EVERYONE and it's funny cuz first thing in the game I was like "It'd be funny if Ian was mush with the gold and everything", which, someone also mentioned in the discussion haha and Man the game was QUIET after Paola died, I bet she will write a 3 page essay here if I don't do it first <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> I can say I'm sad about Frieda's death, and whoever plays Chao gets that urge of killing, guess we all have it inside us! And overall I'm happy with Hua, Kuan-Ti and Chun's performances, which is no surprise considering they ranked top 3, wooo!</p><p>And WHY ON EARTH by the end of the game you guys decided I am the mush and swapped at Gioele-Paola rush!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Eleesha</p>

                <p>Hey all! Paola here. I'll describe my side of the game a bit later, pressed for time atm. Missed you all! Glad you made the thread! Frieda and Gioele - I see your after comments in the game - I suggest to you next time consider talking to the ship as MUCH as you apparently talked to each other.</p><p>Between Frieda's after comment, «I was never mush, just bad luck scanning planet. Very stupid crew !!!» and Gioele's after comment, «You guys are all crazy, nice game. ps: you could have asked before attacking, there is a good reason for the low numbers of planet scans in the logs.»</p><p>So it appeared that Gioele knew the reason, and after all when Frieda died Gioele armored up and attacked -me-, and I had not attacked Frieda at all - and he may not have even thought me Mush - that is indeed playing against the team because he too is not Mush. Is there anyway to report a game after it has ended? I suggest reporting both Gioele and Frieda that game, for possible purposeful playing against the team.</p>

                <p>Jin Su here.</p><p>This was a crazy game.

We kill another...human again..and again..whadaheck is going on?!? <br>I started to suspect almost everyone. None of them were mush. Ian was at the bottom of my suspicion list. Well played.</p><p>And there were hundreds of replies per day. Took me hours reading and writing in the chat.

As noone else seems to start the thread, I'll do it. I won't retell now ALL the story, perhaps I'll do it later, BUT, seeing as there was no <em>body switch</em> (and that was the event that turned us into paranoid maniacs), I want to ask one question.</p><p><strong>Gioele</strong>, WHY IN THE HELL WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO ATTACK YOUR OWN DAUGHTER OVER THE DEATH OF SOME OLD LADY, IF YOU WERE NOT A MUSH?</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I honestly hope someone will come and describe, how awesome this game was, I lack words, perhaps due to little sleeping done in last 24hrs - the game kept me awake.</p><p>Yeah, it was awesome.</p></cite><p>I was sure she was a mush who managed to get Frieda killed on false accusation of not scanning, I was scanning the same way for the past few days (were you even aware of this...) and was pretty sure i had to kill her with no support and fast to save myself, if you went for Frieda i would have been next in line. She said something like "we decided to kill you" to Frieda (well something more elaborate) and i guessed she was the one running things on your investigation group, maybe I was wrong on that too, you will tell me, anyway if you didnt include me, it was probably that you had doubts on me. (shouldnt have since i had picked the "paranoid" skill AFTER mush designation and it was discussed on chat because of the camera mess in the begining, that's a big hint...)</p><p>About the planets, for you to understand, effective way is just <strong>discarding </strong>discovered planets with more than 4~ or something sectors and thus, only <strong>scanning</strong> planets with low number of sectors, for obvious reasons that i can explain if you ask me to, the fact that the planet we went to was 2 sectors and that the trip went without a scratch should be enough for you to figure out.</p><p>Thinking about it after, im pretty sure its here that some of you went wrong, DISCOVERING a planet and SCANNING are 2 different actions and i think only SCANNING appear in logs, so if someday you only find 10 sectors planets and none to scan, it will appear as you did nothing (just like you dont see if someone actually research or not in lab on logs).</p><p>With all the chat going on, none of you bothered to even ask about this.. why not? A lot of peoples were doing nothing at all and/or being much more suspicious... i was screaming at Roland being a mush for days as he was living in turrets and odd places without cameras and Finola who never even accessed the Lab console didnt seem to bother anyone..(nice job Ian btw, never suspected you) so seeing this i was at the time convinced there was some sort of conspiracy and even a transfer after Paola death. I could not talk/read because i droped everything to carry armor and weapons.</p><p>For the reporting you can go ahead, but i dont think i was the one who started the guesskilling fest on this boat <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> actually it started early with stephen, didnt seem to bother anyone at the time, me included i think that if you do something suspicious, you deserve what's coming.</p><p>I knew we had no tech and no raluca so no return to SOL, just a ship going to hell and it did, was fun. Looking forward to read what happened after i got killed.</p>

                <p>My story of this game:</p><p>So I saw I could be Paola, and I just about jumped for joy. My first game I’d been Eleesha and I’d inherited Comm officer part way through – I liked it. I was –sure- I could be one of the best Comm officers ever even though I was just second level, I had it all planned out!</p><p>Well I didn’t plan perfectly (third game…. Loads I don’t know yet). For one I used my initial AP and moves wandering around ship taking inventory (tut tut! Should have saved for Comm duties, silly me). Found out our ship had 5 cameras, and they were going in dorms, bridge, medilab, and lab, I was in heaven! I told people I wanted the sofa built on the bridge and I wanted to more or less live on the bridge, leaving only to eat, that I wanted to cook my own food and I wanted to carry the apron with me.</p><p>That carry the apron to go cook freaked people out a bit; much suspicion that I’d do something to it, got told not to take it from the Lab by Chun even! More negotiation straightened out that I expected to have it out of lab for 3 minutes every few days, and yeah, if I lied about how long I had it out or if something ‘happened’ to it, of course I expected to die.</p><p>So my plan was going great! I just needed that sofa to get built…. But people didn’t come build it or bring the materials for it! And the cycles passed and I was standing on the bridge waiting so…. I start talking to Kuan Ti! An enthusiastic newbie like myself, only even newer than me. I talked him through getting the wrench, going to the microwave to dismantle it… only to finally understand that he didn’t have technician skill, and couldn’t dismantle… Bummer. Worse – finally came to understand that <strong>no one on the ship was a Technician</strong>, <em>I would never, ever have that sofa</em>.</p><p>…. So it was then I gave up my hope of being the best Paola ever, but I still tried to do my best. Chao killed Stephen because Stephen suddenly and mysteriously cooked 4 meals and left them in the refractory for anyone who wanted them – why? No one asked him too. I now believe that the tutorial is telling Stephens to do this weird thing, since this was my second Stephen I saw suddenly do this, both of them having previously agreed they wouldn’t cook without reason and being asked too…</p><p>So people called for Chao’s head and I argued that the kill made sense, the only problem was that Chao needed to not make unilateral kill decisions, that there should be a committee including Chun and a good 3-4 other players at least. Chao, who clearly had never been part of a kill committee before, invited me and Chun to a private chat the next day. An investigation team got mentioned on the public chat, which freaked a few people out, including Kuan Ti and Eleesha, both of whom were concerned that they were not on it. Kuan Ti extremely so. I was pretty sure that my newbie buddy who I was talking with a ton in a private chat about how to play and how to avoid being spiked and what was and wasn’t suspicious was indeed human, so I talked Chao into accepting Kuan into the investigation thread, which did wonders to calm Kuan down about the legitimacy of the investigations and we got his intense curiousity and interest in trying to understand evidence too.</p><p>We strongly suspected Janice, Kuan and I did, because she had no fear of being together with others where there were no cameras. She ran to the refractory to ‘help’ Kuan find the microwave to dismantle – like you can do that through being in the same room instead of talking to him from a safe room and explaining how to find it – and she sat in Nexus relaying with people – both were great opportunities to spike people, and not bad chances to get spiked either if the wrong people were Mush, she seemed to have no fear, which scared me a lot.</p><p>But it was Frieda we got most suspicious of. And the reason was that I realized that there was no log evidence that she was doing –anything- with the astro terminal except connecting to it. She was supposedly using all her AP to find planets – but she wasn’t telling us what she found at all, good or bad, and she wasn’t really doing anything else either. We had hunter troubles, Frieda was a pilot, and our only other one was Hua – but Frieda told us she couldn’t help with hunters because she had to save her AP for the planet search.</p><p>By start of D4, no oxygen planets had been found, no reports from Frieda about how the search was going, she was walking around a great deal (several times a day most days) in and out of the bridge and its camera. Why? To spore? To use the AP she was claiming she was using on the planet search in some nefarious fashion? And then Gioele came and actually analyzed a planet, which helped us understand from the room log that Frieda actually hadn’t been analyzing –any- planets.</p><p>I don’t really understand even now why to throw away planets completely unscanned. Sure, they may have many sectors – but why not scan a few to see if you see what we want or not? A big planet with a bunch of good and okay sectors – we wouldn’t want that thrown away. But to throw planets away unanalyzed is to waste completely the AP used to find them, right? – apparently Frieda did this over and over again for game days… And it is an awesome cover for a Mush. –Awesome- cover. I say don’t do this because you can secretly ‘appear’ to use your AP in a totally non-provable fashion, then really go use it somewhere else doing something else, great for Mush.</p><p>So Chun, Chao, Kuan Ti, and Eleesha discussed for about 24 hours, what should we do about Frieda? What the pros and cons and odds were of her behavior being mush.</p><p>Then a cycle change brought 14 hunters on us, right as our ship’s slow time started, when most players were offline. I was online most cycles, and I caught it. We still had no reports of a decent planet of any sort, we were getting low on O2, we didn’t have a rebel base contact currently, none of the hunters were blockers – it was clear to me what needed to be done. We had to move the ship one distance, to lose those hunters before they massacred the hull, so I called for people to help load 1 fuel and help get the hacker kit to the bridge, since Hua and Jin Su were not going to be online for many hours.</p><p>And it worked. One cycle passed while we were getting organized, and our hull took only 5 damage that cycle, even with the 14 hunters (lucky!) but it was time to try and move the ship! And I succeeded with my second hack, and had just enough AP left to give the move order. We were off! The hull was safe for now! I’d hacked for the first time!</p>

                <p>Earlier that day Jin Su had picked up the apron to advance research, then forgotten to drop it and carried it to the dorm and went offline – his pattern was to log off for a few hours and come back after that at that time of day. Frieda started calling Jin Su out as a Mush for having taken that apron away – I hit that hard as hysteria, false accusation, hadn’t we all occasionally forgotten to drop something we picked up? And that Jin Su should be back in a couple hours, tops – if the Apron didn’t get back to the lab in a decent amount of time or disappeared – then we kill Jin Su. But really – what was the problem at this point? Mush don’t bother doing ‘tiny stuff’ like that, Mush actions are seriously dangerous or allow them to contaminate others – what was the real harm in what Jin Su had done? Also, I challenged Frieda on her own behavior, and how her planet search was making no log of her AP use – for all I knew she was just logging into the terminal then out again without using any AP. What was she doing?</p><p>She answered that she couldn’t read my long message. Then she answered highly defensively, that she was sorry she couldn’t prove she was searching for a planet. And she totally dropped her calling for Jin Su to die – which I thought was also highly suspicious. If she –really- thought he was Mush, she should have been presenting evidence, defending her case – to me she sounded like a Mush trying to get a human framed for an accident, and as a whole her entire behavior looked like a great case for her being a Mush.</p><p>She later talked about room logs of Gioele scratching a skin disease, and said she thought it was sign of Mush activity. I asked her what she meant, and she was very slow to answer, but finally explained almost a day later that she meant she thought he had been given a disease by a Mush. Until she explained that, I thought she meant that he was a mush because he was scratching, that she thought his scratching was proof he was a Mush and she was calling for him to die for being suspicious – I really thought there was a lot of ‘rabble rousing’ and unreasonable suspicion in what Frieda was saying about Mushy behavior and suspects. That made me even more sure she was Mush, and even more sure when she ‘backed down’ that she was doing so to save her own neck, to claim that no, she’d not done anything unreasonable, she was a good guy, when she wasn’t.</p><p>After the ship was moved, Kuan Ti discussed how weird it would be if Frieda suddenly found an oxygen planet, after having been challenged about not actually using her AP to search for planets. I told him, that’s what I’d do if I were mush – actually work now to save my neck from further suspicion and claim to have just been unlucky before. And lo and behold – Frieda very shortly after claims she found a planet with just 2 sectors, intelligent life and O2. Her planet was real, we got the O2, but we still had to decide what to do with Frieda. We decide kill her, explain why after, no matter if she is Mush or human – invite everyone else into the investigation thread to read the evidence and conclusions that convinced us all.</p><p>Frieda is online for her execution, she calls for help. I start to explain her death sentence and as the ship starts to seem hysterical, invite people into the investigation thread, everyone who is able to be invited, so they can see for themselves the case, the evidence, and how it was handled. But Gioele doesn’t stay to read that thread, within a minute of being invited he leaves it, having dropped his communicator. A bit later, I check for new updates and see that my health’s at 7 and I have some sort of wound. Panicked, thinking I might be under attack at that very second, I flee the room, not even taking the time to check the room log and see who had been attacking me. I flee to the lab.</p><p>Once there, I check the items, I remembered the medikit was in the lab last I knew! IT’s there! I try to pick it up, I have 3 AP left…. I realize, having already clicked on the pick up button, that the button was strange. It had… an AP cost of 2 to pick up.</p><p>And now I had the medikit and 1 AP left. And my channels are gone. I have 2 move points left. I’m still panicing, but I cannot use that medikit…. I cannot talk…. I check my wound, it’s indeed a punctured lung. I cannot even drop the medikit, which requires 2 AP to do. I’m losing 2 hps a cycle. I realize after a few minutes that I do indeed have one way to communicate still – I can create a general announcement. But that too requires 2 AP, and I don’t *have* that 2 AP. If I hadn’t paniced, if I hadn’t picked up that medikit – but I had.</p><p>So I go back into the medibay, where if I am incredibly lucky, someone will realize I am there and have a wound that prevents speech. My attacker is gone, he was gone before I fled. I didn’t even need to run. Lying down even will cost me 2 AP, and it’s about 2 hours left to end of cycle. At that cycle end, I’ll have 2 AP – I can send a general announcement. I prepared one, explaining my wound and health status, that if they think I’m Mush and want me gone, just wait 3 more cycles, I’ll have bled out, otherwise they had 2 cycles to get my wound fixed somehow. A mission could allow me to lie down, or drop the medikit, but I had no way to hear anything they told me to do – except maybe I could read instructions in a mission if one came with an order to lie down, drop the medikit, or anything else.</p><p>Message prepared, I waited, checking the game for updates every 15 minutes or so. Half an hour to cycle end, I had updates. Eleesha had come into the room with me, had punched me 3 times, landing each hit, hitting me for 2, 1, and 2 damage. I was at 2 hps now. Eleesha had then lay down on the bed beside me.</p><p>I wondered how terrifying I must appear, standing there silently, having picked up the medikit and walked 1 room away with it. I wondered what everyone thought of me, if Eleesha was Mush and acting on her own or if the consensus was that I was deadly dangerous and must be killed immediately. But I had no chance to ask, because at 2 hps, I knew the cycle change that would give me the AP I needed to make a general announcement would also bring me to 0 hps. So I prepared my farewell message and accepted that for me, the game had already ended.</p><p>Angrysnail, thanks for explaining your reasoning as Gioele. I no longer thing you should have been reported. I wasn’t sure then either – and if you were mush you certainly shouldn’t have been. Your paranoia is reasonable.</p><p>I do wonder though, your Mush profile says you have 36 points, you’ve been on 3 voyages, your longest mission was 6 days. Why are you so sure that it’s the right thing to do, to throw away planets unanalyzed?</p><p>No, you were not especially a suspect. No, I didn’t know you were scanning and throwing away planets, what I knew was that you actually reported a planet’s details, which was great! Someone was actually analyzing planets! And inexplicably, without explanation, that person did not appear to be the one claiming to put all her AP into finding us planets but hadn’t told us anything about that search or given us any results for three days. And you –were- invited to that thread, the same as everyone else not actually on it – you just didn’t accept the invitation, you preferred to drop your talkie and come kill me. Acceptable choice though – I no longer think you were possibly playing against your team. You were just as wrong as the rest of us were, for acceptable reasons </p><p>As for guesskilling fest, I agree that isn’t reportable. What I didn’t have was any –reason- as to why kill me. I wasn’t a killer, I was –talking-, but you didn’t talk, you came to slay. You didn’t read, you left the conversation instead. Now that I understand, I understand. If you had read, you would have read our discussion over should we –discuss- this with the probable Mush Frieda, how much warning should we give her, how much harm should we expect if she rampages. Was there any explanation we could imagine that we would accept? We decided that no, with the evidence at hand, a kill made sense. We were wrong, but that’s what happened and why.</p>

How badly you're in need of a planet, and whether or not there are other more important things for people do do also come into play.</p><p>Also, with NERON priority set to astrophysics, an extra zone is uncovered by everyone, so 2 for non-skilled, 3 for with.

With all the fuel and effort, why not find a nice planet with lots of good zones?</cite><p><strong>TLDR: will someone who lived until end make us a little report? the scanning method may or may not have been good, but we had no air problem, im guessing you guys never had to go on explorations/planet scanning again until hunters destroyed the hull from lack of pilots, wasnt Frieda a pilot? ooops</strong></p><p>Just guesstimated that AP wise, you are better off simply scraping big planets and scan small planets. I play other mush versions and it appears that its how its usually done there, at least for the 1st planet of the trip, because the more days pass, the more planets get big and dangerous so its less likely to get the perfectly safe planet later on, but its a luxury you can afford on the first one.</p><p>On a bigger planet you can get lost ppls, get diseases, with an inactive Finola its a bad thing, you will get damages and need to heal after that especially without someone with diplomacy, again waste of aps, you can have a mush with the traitor skill, all this for what? fruits that nobody will use or rations that will make more peoples sick? With the perfect party going for Eden you might want to do differently but i think that considering what we had it was the best choice to go for a safe planet and just refill enough O2 to finish the mush hunt.</p><p>Add to that the fact that if the planet is too big, you may have to go twice to explore all the sectors (since you can only do 6 each trip?), eventually leaving more time for mush on board to organise and move the ship while peoples are out there. (happened to me recently and i wasnt really confortable leaving especially since Jinsu insisted on NOT coming, he was on brige and Roland on reear turret, very close to the fuel..)</p><p>That being said, MAYBE it was the wrong method and a stupid idea (im statisician, could try to really calculate but even then, its a very situational choice and having the numbers wouldnt help much)</p><p>Meanwhile, Finola and Roland are walking around ship, sleeping in the most suspicious places possible and not contributing at all, i kept reporting it but none is bothered. (Turns out only Roland was mush but the 2 of them were looking a lot more dangerous than anyone else, was it really Paola who started spreading doubts about Frieda or someone else? im VERY curious about that because i was sure its the case and like i said, the reason i went for her, could be wrong, please do tell)</p>

                <p>Correct me if I don’t remember accurately all the details or forget something.</p><p>This part is a bit blury for me. After Paola suddenly left the chat we thought someone made a body swap with Paola. Giole probably. We weren’t sure how that body swap works. There was lots of confusion who me meant as Paola and Giole. Paola before swap or after. Anyway, Giole killed Paola. We decided to kill Giole as we thought he was a mush. Turns out he wasn’t. We couldn’t make sense of the situation. Roland was killed around this time as well. Or did we suspect Roland was the one who made the first body swap with Paola? I don’t remember. Someone who do please explain what was happening.</p><p>Roland was a mush so there was just one mush more. I wanted Terrence killed just to see if he was a mush and we can get over the mush hunt if he was. Kuan-Ti and me spent lots of AP attacking him just to see him die in next cycle of fatal depression. <br>Don’t remember what happened to Finola.</p><p><strong>Last few cycles.</strong> Eleesha IS A MUSH announcement said. At this point not many suspicious players were left. She did decode the rebel signal few cycles earlier which gave us all 6 moral points. I wasnt sure if she really is mush because of that but that could also be a trick so we don’t suspect her. Chao went to kill her but attacked Janice in another dorm instead. Ian was sleeping in the same dorm so he had to use 3 ap for each attack and didn’t manage to kill her. I started to suspect him being a mush who was killing humans on purpose while disguising as mush hunter. Except first kill he did consult with others who to kill. Kuan-Ti was persuading me it was a honest mistake. While I was thinking should I kill him Janice woke up, saw she was attacked by Chao and immediately killed him without consulting with others. Turns out he was a human. I would like to hear from Chao why did he attacked Janice. Was it because she refused giving you hugs or just a mistake?</p><p>So Kuan-Ti and me went to kill Eleesha in alpha dorm. We spent our few APs except one we had left on kicking her. We didn’t kill her and decided it’s better to go to bravo dorm where we would be safe next to Ian and not staying with her as she could kill us after she wakes up. <br>We had only few armor points left and we were under attack. Hua went shooting them but did not have enough APs to destroy all of them.<br>Ian wakes up. I was relieved as he could bring us cooked rations to finish killing Eleesha. He walked off and all we could hear was his laugh. Than it dawned on us. IAN IS A MUSH. Oh my God! He was the last one I would suspect. He destroyed command center and Chun headshoted him later.</p><p>Very paranoid game based on all kind of false assumptions.

                <p>Angrysnail - to my knowledge I was the first to suspect Frieda. The investigation chat included me, Chun, Chao, Kuan Ti, and Eleesha - all human players by coincidence, but we knew that we could have one or more Mush with us, and we talked things out and tried to be very logical. We discussed what we believed was evidence, and all 5 of us agreed Frieda was probably mush. I was the first to feel convinced - Eleesha was the last, and more because she wanted to try and find evidence of how Frieda might be spending her AP elsewhere if not on the terminal.</p><p>My initial reason to suspect Frieda was that she had 'the perfect cover' to lie about how she was spending AP, because the astro terminal didn't appear to report if she was actually using AP or not. I'd also never been on a ship before that made it to D3 without finding an O2 planet.</p><p>Additional reasons were that she appeared to be trying to spread hysteria about who to kill, who might be Mush. Particularly Jin Su's walking off with the apron. That's a mistake I've made on other ships about 3 times, and I've seen others do it too. It's more dumb than Mush-action, and she made multiple posts about how he must be a mush over it. Coincidentally, he wasn't a mush either. What she said about you was also suspicious, talking about your scratching being 'mush action' - it was very unclear from how she said it - it really sounded to me like she was trying to explain you could be mush because you had the room logs about your disease.</p><p>In any case, once we understood that actual analysis of planets made a room log - and that she'd spent a minimum of 3 days not actually analyzing any planets at all - we all agreed to 'kill'.</p><p>Amusingly, we had multiple lines of evidence about her, mutual agreement of 5 players, and had spent a day trying to make sure and discussing.</p><p>You didn't even bother to read possible evidence that could have helped you decide who, if anyone in the decision to kill her, might actually be Mush or not. No criticism for your own choices and decisionmaking processes though, right Angrysnail?</p>

After Paola suddenly left the chat we thought someone made a body swap with Paola. Giole probably. We weren’t sure how that body swap works. There was lots of confusion who me meant as Paola and Giole. Paola before swap or after. Anyway, Giole killed Paola. We decided to kill Giole as we thought he was a mush. Turns out he wasn’t. We couldn’t make sense of the situation. Roland was killed around this time as well. Or did we suspect Roland was the one who made the first body swap with Paola? I don’t remember. Someone who do please explain what was happening.</p><p>Roland was a mush so there was just one mush more. I wanted Terrence killed just to see if he was a mush and we can get over the mush hunt if he was. Kuan-Ti and me spent lots of AP attacking him just to see him die in next cycle of fatal depression. <br>Don’t remember what happened to Finola.</p><p><strong>Last few cycles.</strong> Eleesha IS A MUSH announcement said. At this point not many suspicious players were left. She did decode the rebel signal few cycles earlier which gave us all 6 moral points. I wasnt sure if she really is mush because of that but that could also be a trick so we don’t suspect her. Chao went to kill her but attacked Janice in another dorm instead. Ian was sleeping in the same dorm so he had to use 3 ap for each attack and didn’t manage to kill her. I started to suspect him being a mush who was killing humans on purpose while disguising as mush hunter. Except first kill he did consult with others who to kill. Kuan-Ti was persuading me it was a honest mistake. While I was thinking should I kill him Janice woke up, saw she was attacked by Chao and immediately killed him without consulting with others. Turns out he was a human. I would like to hear from Chao why did he attacked Janice. Was it because she refused giving you hugs or just a mistake?</p><p>So Kuan-Ti and me went to kill Eleesha in alpha dorm. We spent our few APs except one we had left on kicking her. We didn’t kill her and decided it’s better to go to bravo dorm where we would be safe next to Ian and not staying with her as she could kill us after she wakes up. <br>We had only few armor points left and we were under attack. Hua went shooting them but did not have enough APs to destroy all of them.<br>Ian wakes up. I was relieved as he could bring us cooked rations to finish killing Eleesha. He walked off and all we could hear was his laugh. Than it dawned on us. IAN IS A MUSH. Oh my God! He was the last one I would suspect. He destroyed command center and Chun headshoted him later.</p><p>Very paranoid game based on all kind of false assumptions. Great game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p></cite><p>Thanks a lot, wow i missed a lot of fun in the end. Well all is said and done for me, thanks all for this fun game. Farewell.</p>

                <p>Actually, the first person suspected as mush was <strong>Janice</strong>. Her standing-a-long-time in the Nexus room (while several people had to come in there to research projects (and now I'm curious why Roland didn't spike her then)), her not-so-willing-to-comfort-anyone-besides-Ian mood (she basically ignored any requests) was pretty suspicious.</p><p>The second person - <strong>Frieda </strong>- well, Frieda, I do remember you saying like ONE TIME something about shooting hunters, but you weren't really reporting anything in the chat. If you'd type out every time you've searched for a planet the results you've found - there won't be much suspicions, which aroused exactly because in 3 days you've 'reported' 2 planets: first in words like "oh I'm unlucky it has ruminants" which isn't exactly bad, and the second you reported was that planet with O2.<br>If you'd share your findings, or your tactic to discard planets with lots of slots (which perhaps would be corrected), there would never be such consequences.<br>The most suspicious moment was when you took the apron to the refectory and met there with Gioele, with no cameras. And didn't report either taking apron or placing it back to the lab, which I did for you in ITEMS conversation - and right after you felt the urge to explain how important it was to take it there so Gioele must eat and how you're a perfect team. Frankly, at that moment, I didn't know yet that extracting a spore makes a player dirty even if he wears an apron, so your silent meeting with hastily explanation given after made me deeply nervous. My bad.</p><p>Finola didn't raise much suspicion basically because at first she was an AFK player, and then she moved to the lab and stayed there just upgrading researches, that's why.</p><p><strong>Gioele</strong>, you were not on the "excavation team" perhaps because you weren't much concerned about it - perhaps you could just like ask in chat adn be added there. I, personally, really liked your way with cameras, but Paola's attack was a surprise.</p><p>About "ask us why we were doing smth" and, that way, warn the mush which we thought Frieda could be? There was no other explanation to lack of visible results from that player. Also, I think that it's actually best to report everything that is going well or isn't going well in general chat - that way, every human on ship knows what's going on with each other, and can easily check it with the logs.</p><p>Now, about "body switch" incident which really didn't happen, and why <strong>Eleesha</strong> became a suspect.<br>When the incident happened, Chun was really sure that there was a mush involved, who jumped into someone. And both Gioele and Paola died as humans, and here the suspicious part about Gioele was that he dropped his walkie-talkie to 'carry weapons', while in reality Gioele doesn't even need weapons, he's great in a fist fight. I checked logs scrupulously, and thought - perhaps he jumped into someone else, and <strong>Paola</strong> couldn't speake because either the same mush, or the other, was controlling her walkie-talkie (I was shocked enough to learn mushes can switch bodies, so finding out about the radio pirate skill finished me), while she stayed human. So, I knew about the incident only by short report from Chao (oh, Chao, where art thou?), so I went to check the logs again. And I found out that human Paola was killed by Eleesha, so I thought: <strong>gotcha</strong>.</p><br><p>Mush could jump either in Chao, who was there, or in Eleesha perhaps, which made sense with her killing Paola. Also Chao's behaviour didn't change, while Eleesha became pretty much talkative and started pointing out goals via ennouncements.<br>I had nobody to share my thoughts with - I mean, I typed that in <span class="tid_strike">Paola</span> Chun Chao channel, but Chun didn't answer and Chao was offline, so I decided to share with <strong>Jin Su</strong> whom I started to trust after working together, and <strong>Hua</strong> - because she worked twice as much on that ship as anyone, and she was spiked by Roland under the camera in dorm (we killed him soon after) - and I was pretty much sure that mush can't spike mush. So I shared everything I thought about if how the switch took place, that the mush had to be somewhere near, and the only suspects were Chao and Eleesha. So we talked it over and decided, that Eleesha was more suspicious with her sudden sense of purpose and all.</p><p>And here it happened. The event that pretty much ruined everything.<br>Chao went to kill Eleesha (who was sleeping alone in A-dorm which I knew because I woke up on the bunk near her), saying something like "yes I think Eleesha is suspicious", went out and attacked Janice, who was in B-dorm with Ian.</p><p>...</p><p>He wasted all his ap on her, without killing, before saying "oh she's got some strange protection". At that moment I was in the lab, I think. I started to google mush skillz - and couldn't find one, which would suggest such a strange protection. I went to Eleesha's dorm to check if Chao was telling the truth and yes, here she was, requiring 1 ap to punch.<br>And then... I realized he went in the wrong dorm. <br>After that Eleesha came online, and killed Chao immediately. I tried to stop her without warning all the ship that we strongly suspect Eleesha is a mush, but she wouldn't listen.<br>And Chao died a human, of course.<br>That left one possible target - Eleesha.<br>At that moment only me and Jin Su had some points left, so I went to the dorm and punched her three times, and fell on the next bunk to sleep. That was I think the scariest night in my life, somewhat reminding the final scene of Carpenter's "the Thing" - when you're pretty much sure that the human, sitting next to you, isn't human at all. So I wasn't able to fall asleep in real life and came back to the game.</p><p>With next cycle Hua took off to attack hunters, Jin Su came to punch Eleesha twice, and I was able to do it once and then move together with Jin Su to the next dorm, where Ian was, and Janice dropped the blaster.<br>Suddenly, Ian comes online and asks, how he could help. We asked for the rations, and I blame myself that I didn't pick up the blaster right away - stupid politeness and fear to be suspected in some adversary actions.<br>So Ian grabs the blaster and talks a little more, while I type things like "you won't need it, give it back" and such.</p><p>Ian goes out, laughs manically and mutates.</p><p>I'm glad Chun had you decapitated, Ian. I trusted you.<br>(However I thought that perhaps it was Hua - she already made SO MUCH for the ship, that I wouldn't be surprised if it was her).</p><p>That pretty much covers it.</p>

                <p>Those details are awesome, that pretty much finishes the adventure of this ship for me. Thank you a lot Kuan Ti! I too had a 'from the Thing moment' with Eleesha, when I was bleeding out and she was sleeping beside me and I couldn't read any messages, let alone make any myself. The game let me read the ones that happened on public channel only before my death, so I got to understand your guys' reasonings and concerns about a body swap...</p><p>Let me speak breifly about what I understand about body swapping - the swapper wants to leave their badly bro</p><br><br><p>The good thing is I think we learned a LOT about the game, and had fun at least at moments. Though I've only played 3.5 ships right now, thisship is a very, very special one to me. Largely because of my neat interaction with Kuan Ti in play, actually being part of a non-desperate Mush investigation team. I was a big part of one my ship 2, but most of the ship was inactive - things were close to hopeless very early (the ship died on D5 - not one research or project was ever finished!!!) - it's really different being part of an investigation team under those conditions.</p><p>And that 'You have died a horrible death' thingy via perforated lung; though quite uncomfortable, it was also ironically hilarious and hopefully drove home in my head the 'do not panic' mantra from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Surely needed - anyone seen my Towel?</p><p>I've got a lot to learn still. Maybe most of us from this ship do. But wow Team - I had interesting and intense experiences with several of you, as near as I can tell no one broke the rules (especially not on purpose, which is the heart of 'do not play against your team' to me - you have to mean bad I believe to break that rule, ignorance, innocent mistakes, misunderstandings, and panic can and do hurt the ship, but that's not playing against the team)</p>

                <p>Doh, got interrupted when trying to add this part, sorry.</p><p>This is what I understand about body swapping - the swapper wants to leave their old body badly broken and unable to communicate, so whoever they force into their old body is in terrible shape and will be easily slain before that player can tell people what happened or ask for help.</p><p>Gioele would have made a terrible decision to attack me, then swap into me. A mush wants the opposite to happen in general, they want to give someone their bad body for that person's hopefully good body.</p><p>If I'd been a mush and body swapped - I would have tried to take Gioele or Eleesha if either had a spore - and when I walked into medilab I would have swapped with any of you there that had a spore, then ensured that the body died before next cycle if possible. What Eleesha did, especially coupled with what you guys say was a change in communication patterns, becoming more talkative and more like a leader.... more like me, would you say?... that's -exactly- what I would look for if a player like me might have swapped out into Eleesha's body.</p><p>So trying to kill Eleesha makes sense to me. I know I didn't swap into her, but on the surface what I know of how she played until my death, and what I understand happened after it - that's perfectly consistent with what I probably would have done had I been Mush and able to swap with someone.</p>

                <p>Here's the story of the man behind the curtain. Hehehe. Can't complete the adventure before you see through the eyes of the accursed. I don't remember if Angel gave me gold before or after I found out I was MUSH, but I do remember that when I found out I was MUSH the first thought was "Shit, this ships crew is so active I'm not going to last a day!" The second thought was filled with a golden taint of guilt. When Chun gave up 6 days to this wicked wretch I was filled with guilt. At the time I had Ian up to Lv 3 and my Mush status at 0, however I had been saving up to bring my Chao to lv 4. I Lved up my Mush to 4, and was only a few cycles away from Lv 5. So I waited a few cycles and unlocked booby-trapping shelves. Up until then I played it real cool... Except pretending to be dirty from gardening, when in fact I had been using my spare AP from gardening to extract spores. First time Mush and I refuse to read wiki's, so I had very little knowledge on what made me dirty and what stuck in logs. Roland hadn't been active for the first day and I thought I was on my own. So I layed low. Decided to wait until some of the crew had left on an expedition to strike. Roland came online (finally) and explained a few things, one being that MUSH can only spike a person once a... day or cycle... I don't remember. I told Roland my plan of waiting to gang up on Janice or Eleesha during an expedition, and he agreed it was a plan. I boobytrapped the shelf in Bravo bay and low and behold Hua tripped it next cycle. I was gleeful! I figured I'd spike it again and again until she was <em>one of us</em>... But then Paola, the goddess of wisdom (and long posts) declared that mush could spike shelves! A mind reader! A prophet! ACK! And I spiked 4 or 5 other shelves but not one was spiked after that post. But atleast me and Roland, if both ever caught, could jump on Hua and turn her if ever in trouble. And then Steven died... Well was voraciously slain by domi arigoto mr roboto, who never sleeps and never blinks. And I said to Roland, if we stay silent they'll kill eachother off, and then if we can get Hua all three of us can raid the Icarus bay and hole up in the engine room attacking anyone who comes to put us down. Then a planet was found, and I thought! <em>"Hey Roland! A brilliant plan! When they go down to the planet I'll steal the hacker kit and fly us out of here, you go down to that turret by the engine and fuel and I'll start saving AP"</em> Then the godess struck once again! Damn her! Him! It! Ack! Giving the golden gifter the Kit to keep from my cold clutches! So me and Roland slunk back to our dorms and plotted. All this time I had been pushing against anti-spore gas (damn did that hurt us), and <strong>especially</strong> away from the damn serum! Once that was implemented my cool composure broke. I went on my run to the garden, took the metal bib, and extracted my spores. Firstly, I didn't know the bib didn't stop spore extraction from making you dirty, second, I ran out of AP to fix up the garden. <em>"OH GOD IF ANYONE CHECKS THIS OUT THEN I'M A GONER! THEY KILLED STEVEN OVER SQUAT AND THEY'LL KILL ME FOR THIS!"</em> I booked it back to the dorms, dropping the apron off at the Lab, dove into a shower, and jumped into bed. One cycle later the shit hit the fan. Blood everywhere! Frieda: "Chao's trying to kill me AAHHH!" One dead, two dead, three dead. Me and Roland just stood in awe... Then that damn list... Between Roland and Kuan. Kuan moved in to prove his innocence by killing Roland, and so Roland being the slick companion he was, <em>actually came online for his prime moment</em>, fleeing and putting the second spike Hua! He died, Kuan proved his humanhood, and I started conserving my AP for my own last stand. And then the web of a false conspiracy spinning from misinformation and paranoia throttled a few more. I poured out my crocodile tears begging for Janice... By now all sense of guilt was gone, consumed by the thrill of the anarchy. I was ready to launch myself at Hua. But the fear of the that gun-slinging sociopaths kill-o-bot finding my error in the garden... Oh that kept me on edge, until he died. And then I came online to find a log full of violence in my dorm. I had had a full thing of AP for quite awhile, and 2 spores for backup. A blaster on the ground, no one near the bridge, ship at 9 armor, Jin Su out of Ap... I needed to confirm... I needed to know I was the only one with AP, I needed to find Hua... But she was out being the hero she was fighting of hunters... But then it dawned on me... No AP... And I had my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu2xI-zKDGc">moment</a>... And forgive me for laughing all the way to the terminal to smash it to bits... But damn did it feel good. But that wasn`t good enough for me. I posted myself outside the door, Mushified, and guarded that door with my life. No way was I going to let that terminal be repaired... And then she appeared like in a dream, the golden hearted mistress of whom I felt the only remorse in my actions for... The money was covered in blood, all your blood, yet I was the only one who could see that, and accepted it none-the less. And she took both my heart and head for it, hehehe.</p><p>So I apologize emptily to you all, for it felt to good to give back that happiness with regret, I`d slaughter you all with a smile again, only I didn`t have to now did I? Best ship by far, and I'l doubt to get another as fun as it for awhile. Best of wishes to you all.</p>

                <p>Grinic, I'd be quite willing to ship with you again, though you're not one of the players I know 'best' from that ship ;p I'm still quite newbie, but high activity might help balance that ;p</p>

Also I believed, that mush or not - anyone could see that Chao was "a bit" bloodthirsty, so mush didn't need to jump into HIM to ensure he'd kill any attacker of anyone - Chao'd do that anyways.

                <p>Eleesha here again. Haha I still love reading these comments <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> By the last day or two I was REALLY frustrated with everything going on. We didn't get a single mush until almost the end, and my JOB IS TO TRACK DOWN THE MUSH so I was feeling bad, I was worried people would suspect me for not finding the mush, I was really excited for day 5 so I could get the tabulatrix, and after losing half the crew mates and realizing they are humans I was like "that's it" and I became more "active". Then I got the comms manager job after paola died, and I never had enough AP's before that how was I gonna deal with both these duties now.. so yeah I was in a state of anger, mistrust and stuff haha ooh good days <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Tips to play Eleesha like a human:</p><p>Have a core of people to share your information with. That's it. If there's no conclusive info, that's known. You're only one set of eyes, so work with more sets than just your own. You can't catch someone who's not dropping clues, and for my part I'm not going to think you're Mush as long as you appear to be working towards a human win.</p><p>I'm not saying you didn't do this - or that you played wrong. But if you do this - there's little reason to stress. I'd be more suspicious of someone who just suddenly 'caught' a Mush without any understanding of how they caught that person (there's mush tactics that involve converting someone, then killing them immediately... and too, the mush know who the mush are, so knowing who the mush are without 'reasons' is actually highly suspicious - either you're mush or you're a griefer random killing and you happened to random kill a mush) than I would be of someone trying and watching and talking and asking questions, but not managing to find any mush just yet.</p>
