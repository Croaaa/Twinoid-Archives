                <p>Pft. Let it never be said, now, that I do not only rely on cheap short tactics to win a Mush game. End link is <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3054," target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3054,</a> but you probably came here for the story. So let me spin my wheel and tell you.</p><p><em>”No one really knew what to do when Raluca died. PILGRED rested at only 43%, there were no technicians remaining, and the intrepid crew (of which, seven remained) which had lasted so long had only barely reached the tenth day. Equipment breakdowns and fires broke out, as the crew struggled to maintain the ship and desperately push for a Sol ending with every drop of AP they had. Little did they know, a Mush was watching them the whole time.”</em></p><p>Among games which I would consider tragic, this is one of them. Game began day 1, I spawned in as Jin Su somewhere around as the seventh player. When I arrived, I had a feeling that this ship would be a great ship. And if it wasn't, I was going to try my damn best to make it a great ship. I sprung into action, creating newbie threads, fostering people, answering questions, generally doing my best to, uh, help people. And then the last person joined, and the Mush Father chose me.</p><p>My human desire to make this a great ship could not leave me, but my Mush desire whispered more sinister things I could do. “Why not propel them to day ten?” it whispered, “Why not bring them one of the best ships they'll have had... And then CRUSH it in front of them?” It seemed an adequate compromise to me, and I knew the Mush Father would be pleased. So I led them. To planets, and expos. The research team was fantastic, always on top of things, always getting what was needed. It was probably the first game I've been on where the research team trumped the project team, and by such a massive margin! Truly you made me struggle.</p><p>When I had made my decision, around day 2, that I was going to make this a great ship as the Mush Father desired, I knew I needed a sacrificial lamb. Frieda, who would accompany me on the bridge frequently and was inactive, was a perfect target. I began sporing her the second day, another the third day. My partner, Chao, was sadly inactive. He didn't survive the Mush integration, fairly rare. Frieda started starving on the fourth day, something that abruptly woke her up. I thought it was over then, at that point they had to know that at best she'd be a beta Mush... Yet no one noticed. I finished the infection day 5, before they placed a mycoalarm on the bridge. I did it only a few minutes into the first cycle, paranoidicly grabbing anonymush the second I saw the extra mush on the counter.</p><p>What probably made up for the fact that they didn't suspect Frieda of being a beta Mush was that she moved, for some reason. Briefly, during the fifth (or was it the sixth?) day, Frieda moved into front storage. It wasn't much, but it was enough to make it seem like the abrupt wake-up was from her player coming back, I'm betting. From that point, it was just a matter of skillfully dodging food eating requests. I only ate once on the fourth day, and didn't eat more than that. My trials weren't over, Paola stumbled upon the Xyloph list from the database. I read it first, and saw that Frieda's name was listed as 'negative' for alpha mush Status. Surely this couldn't be seen! I shredded it, even though they could've seen me shredding it at any time. Funnily enough, Frieda's name was the ONLY name that it said 'Negative' on. I planned my excuse, but no one ever asked about it, I guess they never checked the logs.</p><p>We persisted until around the tenth day, steadily losing crew members for one reason or another. Raluca died as the last person before the catalyst that would set off our immediate focus on PILGRED. We poured everything into that, everyone grabbed a bed. Terrence died around day 10 as well, but after Raluca. But no one suspected the Mush in the Seventh Bed. The mush who desired to get to Sol not for the purpose of getting home, but to please the Mush Father. It wasn't to be. With PILGRED only at 43%, it was hopelessly against us. Even with all six of us committing everything we had to only PILGRED and O2 tank repair when it was needed, we couldn't bring it to completion. At the end, we were 23% short. When that became clear, I began amassing AP, and saved my mission. On the day 11 cycle 7 change, I issued the mission to myself, mutated, and then proceeded to kill Chun, Finola, and Janice in that order. The ship had become a sausage fest, with only Ian, myself, and Roland remaining.</p><p>I had loved Janice, even in my Mush heart. Around day 8, we had begun sleeping together, frequently sharing either a sofa, or a bed, or even just a room together. I thought if we got to Sol, maybe I could infect her and we wouldn't have to be apart. But it wasn't to be. I killed Roland's love, Chun, in the dorms. And I couldn't bear to let Janice die a slow death to the flames in Bravo dorm. I killed her in one hit, my poor love. I called for Roland to meet me in the flames and avenge me, but whether he never did due to fear or to not being on at the moment, I'll never know. The ship exploded the next cycle.</p><p>And to this day, the seventh bed still floats through shattered space, ever remembering its mush inhabitant.</p>

                <p>Captain, I understand why you did what you did there. It gets confusing in space. The smoke of 12 burning rooms gets in your eyes. The mush hormones take over. You do what your instincts tell you to do. They don't teach you about that stuff in school. You have to learn it all by yourself, in the cold dark depths of space. Gasping for one last breath in the flame filled halls of a doomed ship, surrounded by the charred remains of everyone you ever cared about. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Chun, even amidst the flames of oblivion, only the flickering of your love burned in the flame retardant depths of my previously hardened heart. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>To the rest of you; What started out as a routine crew, became the family I never before had.
