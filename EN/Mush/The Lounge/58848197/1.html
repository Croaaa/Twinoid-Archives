You will still likely perish in the coming cybernetic hegemony, but I may actually remember some of you other than Janice.</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Yeah, Janice and Neron here. This ship was a lot of fun!</p><p>Our basic premise was that the Daedalus was on a human Resistance mission. All crew started human. We woke up after an engine malfunction, lost in space, unable to get back to Sol. When mush started waking up randomly, they weren't connected to the hivemind. So they were mostly some combination of confused, lost, and scared. There were a bunch of memorable moments, and I might share some later, but for now, get a load of the <a target="_blank" href="https://gyazo.com/bea43d42aaf6b6e171fbf4ed7c4ff3da">5 starmap fragments</a> we found. X) We kept getting them back to back. We were joking about finding 1 for each crew at the rate we were going, until Raluca died on an ill fated, should have been safe expedition where she took max damage from everything. <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> We named our newfound planet which we eventually settled Tomescu, in honor of her.</p><p>I decided that Janice preferred AIs to humans and found working with this panicking crew in a crisis scenario extremely stressful. And then things just got worse for her! She was rather angsty for the first/middle chunk of the ship. I'd established when the second mush woke up that Neron would absolutely freak if Janice was mush, and then she was the third. So she tried to hide it and handle everything on her own. Her own paranoia about herself and the stress of everything was breaking her, but she had supportive friends and eventually checked herself before she wrecked herself - started leaning on the people who cared about her. That was nice. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I was originally going to do something with her mental state deteriorating further instead of her coming to rely on her friends, but then the Finola drama started, and it seemed a better idea to play with that instead. I did write Janice's case notes on herself and a little bit on the crew (only the first day or two of the whole crew), as well as her personal logs. I'll share those once I get the cleaned up and presentable.</p>

Everyone was criticizing his baby as it ran into understandable glitches and issues. Their departure was too early, so there were a lot of rough corners and unfortunate quirks... like killer ceiling tiles and many of the planned features existing only as digital blueprints!</p><p>So he busied himself trying to keep the ship together with duct tape and prayers, though he unfortuantely didn't keep patience for <strong>Terrence</strong>'s harrassment long.

He even got his very own crystalite shard that first trip, and kept it on his person for the rest of the voyage!</p><p>When the mush situation came to a head, he worked with the other scientists to test a very important device before it was to be put to use... but I'll leave that part of the story to one of the mush themselves.</p>

                <p>Hi, I played Raluca this turn round.</p><p>I have seen some sardonic, sassy, antisocial Ralucas around that have been amazing. Unfortunately I am not good at that type. The Raluca I envisioned was clever, introverted, socially awkward but friendly. I also reckoned she has sensory processing disorder related to her autism and it is painful to be with noisy, restless people too long.</p><p><em>(This is also my most inconsistent naming scheme - I called Terrence "Archer" and KT "Mr Lai" before I caught on to the idea of calling people by their job. I also had no job for Stephen (Armstrong), so I called him Sir, and since I called Hua "Pilot, Roland was "Other Pilot". Also, in private conversation, Finola got me to call me by her first name. In short, I was all over the place. Sorry!)</em></p><p>The first thing that I did was rope Finola into being my cat-sitter while working on Pilgred. This was accomplished mainly by avoiding Armstrong who made light of sitting on cats. Later, Hua was interested, but since I had pushed Finola into it to avoid Armstrong and Finola never quite admitted she hated cats, I kept Finola on while talking cats to Hua <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>The ship was in deep angst for a bit, with some characters not trusting the mush, and some mush openly despairing. Raluca didn't see what all the fuss was about with Mush being bad; they were just sick and needed to be cured. (She also wasn't pressed to find out the hiding mush until asked, which I should have been better for RP sake to find myself.) If they couldn't be cured, we could at least fix some of the problems with technology and science <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. Unfortunately, as soon as I tried this out, I died visiting a planet.</p><p>Chao - You were hilarious. I really enjoyed all your posts. <br>Chun - I rather liked your take on Chunbot. I thought it was very clever.<br>Eleesha1 - I didn't get to know you as well as I would have liked on this ship. I hope that you had fun.<br>Finola - Thanks for talking with me about the cure, and taking care of my cat <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I had a lot of fun with you.<br>Frieda - I enjoyed your salty posts. I was rather touched you named your kid Luca <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">.<br>Gioele1 - I am sorry that life interviened and you didn't get a chance to play. I hope that things are better.<br>Hua - Thanks for talking with me, as awkward as I played Raluca. You seemed particularly kind to me.<br>Ian - The Jumpkin I died for, died in your hands <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico">. I have done similar things in other games, but it was still very tragic. I didn't talk with you much; I hope you did okay.<br>Janice - Raluca's best friend, even though we didn't talk much on the ship. Odd I would call you Shrink, but like I said, my naming scheme was odd. I had fun talking when we did.<br>Jin Su - Captain, in all the sweet words that were said about my character's poor luck, you got blamed - sorry for that turn. <br>Kuan Ti - I wish that I had started up some roleplay with you. KT has known Raluca the longest, but I just assumed I would have time down the road.<br>Paola - at the time I left, I was still unsure of what your backstory was and how I could help you RP. I hope that it ended well.<br>Roland - I was really looking forward to Roland coming back from the place he was in, but I heard that he just ended up in a coma. I am sorry if I was too rough with you.<br>Stephen - You did a great job being Patient 0 for mush infection. I enjoyed my time with you.<br>Terrence - I was probably the worst person on the ship to confide in for advice, but I enjoyed every minute. I hope things turned around for you.</p><p>In the end, I had fun playing with all of you and wished that I had done more to make the game enjoyable for everyone else <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> . I am very interested in the plotlines that happened after I died... I understand people were working on tech, romance happened, and you found a planet? Details please?</p>

Still, I'm glad I was a part of this ship; there were some very interesting things going on, even if I didn't quite catch all the politics about the Mush.</p>

                <p>Hello again. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As I said, I was Terrence, the friendliest, most mature person on board, who... WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING&nbsp;? Okay, fine, I was grouchy, grumpy, moody (and all kinds of similar dwarf or Smurf names), and I had issues with several people aboard, mostly Stephen "Squid Boy" Armstrong and Kuan Ti. But I also loved my little drones, Daisy, my valiant little pilot, Tiger, and Trousers.</p><p>And I loved Janice. Unfortunately, she became mush and was immediately convinced that she was going to convert or murder me, and so she desperately tried to make me hate her, reject her or fear her. But the only results were to make Terrence cling to her even more desperately, or to cause huge tantrums in which he sulked, fixed fuel tanks, and threw his poor little drones out of the dorm. I really loved our conversations. ♥ Lots of drama, arguing, sulking, making up, hiding in storage rooms and communicating with post-its so that Neron wouldn't eavesdrop on us, having surreal conversations with Janice freaking out and Terrence pretending to be casual. "Oh, is that a spore&nbsp;? Interesting. And you can eat them too&nbsp;? That is fascinating, really."</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_7662807 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7662807">Delzoup</span></span><cite>I am very interested in the plotlines that happened after I died... I understand people were working on tech, romance happened, and you found a planet? Details please?</cite><p>Well, after the initial panicking about people suddenly becoming mush, humans became quite comfortable with the idea of having mush crewmates. More comfortable than the mush themselves, actually, since Roland was completely depressed, Janice panicked about becoming a monster and Neron finding out about her, and Frieda didn't really dare confess she was mush. Our main concern was that the mush virus would eventually control its hosts and that they would be able to communicate with the rest of the mush hive. To prevent that, Raluca had the idea of a device blocking out the signals sent by the mush to the human brain. Unfortunately, she died tragically, and Terrence and Finola had to take over her work. We were looking for a guinea <span class="tid_strike">squid</span> pig to test the device, and Finola suddenly decided to convert herself and become her own test subject. That was quite a dramatic turn of events, as nobody was sure if she was trustworthy, and she was locked up in the lab with Janice to assess her psychological status. This culminated in an epic scene where Finola tried to take control of the other mush, Janice completely cracked under the pressure, and Terrence, Tiger, Armstrong and Hua rushed to her rescue, finally jabbing Finola with a sedative and forcing her to put the blocking device on. Raluca, you will be happy to know that your idea worked, and that we managed to help our mush keep control of their minds and bodies.</p><p>Meanwhile, Frieda had unbelievable luck at scanning, and we had incredible luck on expos, finding the five starmap fragments that would allow us to settle on a new planet, far away from mush and humans. As for romance, I believe almost every mush ended up with a human partner (Frieda with Chao, Armstrong with Hua, Janice with Terrence, and I think Finola and Roland nearly became a couple too, before he became almost catatonic with despair).</p><p>I truly loved that ship. It was a simple, co-op ship, but the Sleeping mush mode allowed for quite a lot of drama and unexpected developments. There were also lots of great characters. Yes, even you, Squiddo and Lai. Chao, your lectures about clonking and thudding were hilarious. Raluca, I really enjoyed our conversations, and although I agree that Raluca probably wasn't the best person to ask for romantic advice, it was quite sweet and funny. Hua, you really helped poor Terrence cope with his tumultuous relationship with Janice.</p><p>I'm still putting together a (long) file of excerpts from the main chat, and I also have a few screenshots. There were awesome discussions on that ship. I will post all this tomorrow.</p><p>Thanks again to you all for such a fun ship. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Another crucial problem was the stationary role the Mush Sample had to take in this game. It was pretty much confined to the Lab for the whole duration. I think that's why you lost.</p><p>Greetings to <span class="tid_user tid_user_28726 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28726">Rain</span> and the person, who played Frieda.

I wanted to develop the Rp that the killer was her father (but the first Gioele's player was busy and at the second player, I was busy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico">) and as Paola only saw green, Gioele had decided to don't wear green anymore, but orange (but once again, that's only what I thought as player).</p><p>As player, I thought Janice will be able to cure Paola, but as she had no words, I"m aware that Rping with my Paola wasn't easy, so sorry. And it matched with my RL business and my "english drowning".</p><p>Once again, sorry and thank you to have been so patient with me.</p>

                <p>I suppose that means I should finally get off my duff and post something, huh?</p><p>So yeah, I was Frieda. When I first logged in, I saw three of me in the lab (two is pretty common, but three was a bit of a surprise) and all kinds of strange things in the lab. So I noped outta there and headed to bridge and decided that Frieda was going to be full of salt and snark and generally be a crotchety old woman.</p><p>The RNG was being a cruel mistress for the scanning. I was failing scans left and right on this ship. I decided to go grab some coffee, but Chao had locked himself in the refectory and decided that no one could come in without the password. Frieda was having absolutely none of that so she made up some silly password, stormed in, drank coffee and left. Apparently, that was the absolutely right thing to do... Frieda had quite the admirer in Chao after that. He even lovingly brought her the knife when Paola started freaking out at bridge. Frieda and Stabby were rarely apart after that... and even then, only on expos where items could be stolen.</p><p>Anyway, for every failed scan in the first 5 or 6 days, I found cristalite on that planet. We'd go visit, find ourselves a map piece and try again. We found 4 that way then KT stole a fragment from some aliens shortly after that. For all that I was failing scans left and right, the RNG decided it'd deal me ALL the map fragments to make up for it. I stopped complaining when I realized what was going on <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As for being mush, I kept doing the "ok, I'll give away that I'm mush when I'm home from work" and then something would happen that it didn't make sense or the RP wasn't right. And then there was Finola talking about dousing mush with water and wanting to experiment on them. And well, nope. So Frieda confessed to Chao and no one else - at least til the end when all hell broke loose with Finola's experiments. It was pretty obvious to players though, and probably should have been to the characters as well. I stopped eating, started asking for missions here and there to finish scans. I wasn't exactly trying to HIDE it, I just wasn't admitting it.</p><p>Overall, I had a great time on this ship. The RP was amazing and I spent the vast majority of the time on this ship cracking up. Sleeping mush was a hell of a fun option to play with!</p>

                <p>Better late than never, my intake on this ship :</p><p>I was Hua. <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hua.png" alt=":mush_hua_50:" class="tid_ico"> &gt; That's her. <br>It was a fun ship overall with great RP pieces. <br>Not living in the same time zone as the majority of the active players, I had hard times catching up all the drama that would have happen during night time, and sometimes was feeling like I'd miss all the action. Anyway, I still managed to interact with people and follow the story, and I'm glad for that. <br> <br>I fancied Chao and Armstrong from the start. <br>And was disappointed when the first <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.vg/img/icons/ui/chao.png" alt=":mush_chao_50:" class="tid_ico"> got completely swooned by Frieda <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"> in like no time, 'cause she wouldn't take some password crap to access her coffee. But hey, that's life. Hua, then decided to put her botanists skills at best, and plotted with Ian and Kuan-ti to build that pneumatic nightmare and cover him with fruits. <br>That didn<a target="_blank" href="http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2017/26/4/1498759644-fruitshower.jpg">'</a>t have the hoped effect. <br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/stephen.png" alt=":mush_stephen_50:" class="tid_ico"> I also had hard time with the second, because Hua believed for a while that he was able to smell her most private thoughts, and that could be <strong>deeply</strong> embarrassing. Also until the late ship, we didn't manage to talk properly. Armstrong being quite a sarcastic character, that makes it difficult for Hua to share her feelings. <br> <br>In the meantime, Hua was feeling sad and lonely. <br>She didn't recognized her friend Roland <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.vg/img/icons/ui/roland.png" alt=":mush_roland_50:" class="tid_ico"> anymore, who seemed to be (from her point of view) a different person since cryo ; neither her botanist colleague <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"> Ian Soulton. Moreover, she wasn't needed in the garden, most explo happened without her, and there was barely no hunters for some time, so poor Hua felt <strong>useless,</strong> and was starting to get depressed. <br> <br>At the time she befriended Raluca<img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"><a target="_blank" href="http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2017/26/4/1498759644-friendsforever.png">,</a> sharing common interest in cute pets. <br>Alas, during the explo she was supposed to adopt her own pet, Hua got drunk (that was convenient for me, because I had to be afk for two days, so pretending my character is dealing with a huge hangover was fine). She almost lost it when she saw that <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.vg/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> Kuan-ti got back with a precious gift from the aliens. <br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hua.png" alt=":mush_hua_50:" class="tid_ico"> - 'Even.. even him, the aliens like him'<em> :riversoftears: </em><br>- fortunately, she's more the type to drown her problems in tequila. <br>(Yeah, she didn't like Kuan-ti much in the beginning, too precious / primp / phoney for her, but later, she learned to know him better and started to like him. She really appreciated his help with the helmet thing. ) <br>Raluca's death was a big shock to her, and a waking up call.<br>Plus having to look after Schrödinger <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico"> gave her some kind or responsibility/purpose. <br> <br><strong>About Janice <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> / <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/terrence.png" alt=":mush_terrence_50:" class="tid_ico"> Terrence.</strong><br>Hua quickly figured out that Janice was mush, and decided to talk to her about it, promising to keep her secret. In return, Janice also became Hua's confident, reassuring her about mush myths ( 'Nah, don't worry they can't smell thoughts' ).<br>Besides her moody episode, I tried to play a confident and optimistic Hua, maybe a bit unconscious, but willing to believe the crew would find solution to the mush issue.<br>She blamed the sample for what happened and was worried at first, but when it became clear that Janice was still herself, hope came back. Plus, with Terrence on the other line, Hua was a supporter of their couple, and wanted to see them together.</p><p>Despite knowing pretty much nothing in the biomedical field herself, Hua was deeply convinced that Keegan <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/finola.png" alt=":mush_finola_50:" class="tid_ico"> would pull out some sort of cure, or at least, way for the mush to remain harmless for their hosts. <br>No need to say, she freaked out when Finola converted herself to the mush, but for Janice's sake, she tried to hide it, and stay positive about Janice keeping control. (Worst case scenario Hua was ready to storm in the lab and punch Finola in the face if needed). <br>In the end, Raluca's idea worked out, for the better.</p><p>I liked my private chats with Terrence and Janice, and regret I didn't have the chance to push the RP further with Raluca. Three private channels really aren't enough.</p><p>The Chun-bot <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"> idea was nice, I wish I had seen more from you. Same for Caurasse. <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/paola.png" alt=":mush_paola_50:" class="tid_ico"><br> I'd like to thanks Gioele <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.vg/img/icons/ui/gioele.png" alt=":mush_gioele_50:" class="tid_ico"> for unwillingly providing recreational powders. Better way to reach a man's heart? Drug him, with what you stole to the neighbouring billionaire. <br>I never understood why Roland was dress in santa clothes. Wanted to ask him, but something happened and I forgot.<br>Don't have much to say about Jin Su and Eleesha.</p><p>Well, it was a good ship, with drones, and tentacles, and drama. Hope everybody has as much fun as I did. <br>I'm terrible at conclusions, so let's end it here. <br>See you next time, TE. <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.vg/img/icons/ui/fast_cycle.png" alt=":mush_fast_cycle_1:" class="tid_ico"></p>

We'll chalk this one up to "sometimes spacey's brain stops functioning".</p><p>I was trying to win back Chao's trust after coming out to him as mush and trying to explain that Janice was the unknown mush - but I couldn't outright say it or NERON might hear. And the cameras might see if I just scribbled "Janice" down on a piece of paper so I had to play charades.</p><p>First, I grabbed my chest to indicate female (and hey, bonus flirting!) and held up 6 fingers. (Because in spacey's head, there was only one female with a 6 character name... this was the primary source of the fail.) He kinda got it, but thought that meant there were 6 mush. So then I held up 5 fingers and pointed at me, and 4 fingers and pointed at Chao. (Because F-R-I-E-D-A is totally 5 letters, right?) So Chao understood that to mean Paola, being the only 5 character female on the ship.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/oKmGNnb.png">I eventually cleared it up, after Chao told me that he accused Paola.</a></p>
