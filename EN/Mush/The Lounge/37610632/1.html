Man what a great game. <strong>Finola and I started as Alpha Mush</strong> and this was the first time I had an active Mush partner. We had schemes and plans and they pretty much got ruined right up until the needs of the ship overcame the need for security.</p><p>It was a semi rough start for the humans. <strong>Terrence</strong> was being a little weird, then while we were sporing <strong>Ian</strong> <strong> Terrence</strong> decided to pick up the Mush Sample and Apron and be a big jerk... so the crew killed him.</p><p>Research picked up after that and <strong>Finola</strong> had to help enough so she didn't look bad. I had it mostly easy at the start, there were Hunters in the beginning then nothing for many many cycles. We weren't totally sure <strong>Frieda</strong> was inactive but it looks like she never finished the tutorial. We did manage to turn her Mush and get<strong> Finola</strong> Anonymushed before research made such thing super tough. Then it was just a matter of waiting and seeing what was going to happen. Pretty much everyone else was active as I recall.</p><p>I convinced the crew that Automatic Sprinklers were a bad idea compared the other projects because my plan was to grab all the extinguisher and the BP and jump ship if things got hot. If they killed Frieda I would do this so Finola could Anonymush her way to victory.</p><p>THEN <strong>Eleesha</strong> printed the list and neither <strong>Frieda</strong> or I were on it so we were screwed again. Somehow<strong> Finola </strong>managed to "prove" she wasn't Mush, mostly I think she convinced <strong>Chun</strong> that she was on the level. I know <strong>Eleesha</strong> at some point wanted to kill her. <strong>Ian </strong>also supported <strong>Finola</strong> as being cool. The humans were convinced that there was only one Mush left (<strong>Chao</strong> eventually killed <strong>Frieda</strong>) and when<strong> Ian</strong> got slimetrapped he thought it was in the dorms and Finola never went down there till the end.</p><p>THEN I screwed up big time. After <strong>Finola</strong> just got finished telling me you don't get dirty doing NERON projects I posted "Project at 76% and Dirty". We both thought it was over for me so I ran to the refectory, ate a ration, and posted it in the dirty thread as quickly as possible. If anyone had checked the logs they would've seen my mistake. Somehow though nobody picked up on it. I picked up Hardboiled and basically logged in every 30 minutes for a while in case I had to use Plan Extinguisher.</p><p>We were still no closer to winning but Oxygen was getting low. We had really terrible scans and that helped a lot. No O2 for a while. Finally we were down to 5 and they found a planet with O2 and some dangers, but they had to go. The main problem was that<strong> Jin Su </strong>was still not considered safe but the previous couple of expeditions went really bad and people thought we had a Traitor Mush (we didn't, just bad luck). I'm not entirely sure how they arrived but it was decided <strong>Jin</strong> would stay behind and <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> would Guard the Front Corridor.</p><p>I pretended to be AFK for most of this and one the expedition was off we went into action. I went to the Engine Room to kill<strong> Raluca</strong> (the last technician) but couldn't quite do it, so I spored her and Transfered. <strong>Finola</strong> Transfered into<strong> Jin</strong> and we made our way to <strong>Kuan Ti,</strong> killed him, and moved the ship (I also loaded fuel back in the Engine Room). And that pretty much spelled the death sentence for the ship. 4 more Humans dead and the remainder killed us over the next few cycles, then died of Oxygen.</p><p>Kudos to my Mush comrade, you did great, and we had some fun despite our original plans getting screwed. And the humans did decent despite having some inactivity and some bad intel. Fly with you guys again soon!</p>

                <p>Your courageous and partially suicidal Mycologist Ian here! Strange how we thought Finola wasn't Mush. It's always the same with Finola's everywhere, being too trustworthy.<br>I was prepared to die on the expedition but two transfers(and being left behind) were completely unexpected!</p><p>At least we were on top of research, even with a Mush Finola, who rarely did research.</p>

                <p>Gioele here. Thanks for the write-up.</p><p>I did try to stay alert towards the mush this game and try to help out in finding them, but I did have stuff happen to me, like speaking out against mush test and getting dirty often early and getting hurt from taking a shower and things which clearly never made me trustworthy, so I was never invited to the real mush hunting. I once ate a human storebought ration, but never told the crew, that would be a stupid way to be confirmed human. I kinda liked being suspected even though I spend all my ap and coffee ap on so much research.</p><p>I tried two things, which should have been Eleesha's job but she hardly ever talked so no idea what exactly she did. I kept track of the food in the refectory for the off chance that a mush might forget to eat in time and I kept track of everyone who ever entered Alpha dorm where we had our shower. The food tracking didn't result in much, just more reasons to kill Terrence who wasted a lot. Near the end everyone had eaten, only stephen didn't enter refectory but i'm pretty sure he ate useless fruit from the expo.</p><p>The alpha dorm/shower list was more interesting. It helped in trusting Finola as she didn't enter alpha dorm at all so she didn't spore people for sure and with Ian getting a spore we knew the mush did spore. I didn't get to chat a lot with Chun though she really hardly ever had a chat open. I had to try for nearly 24 hrs to get my msg across to her and then i close the chat again as soon as possible. So i only passed some info I didn't really get to discuss it. I also reported to Chun at some point that everyone who did enter the Alpha dorm either had a clear reason to do so. for a bed or a reported shower. The only exception to that list was Roland who passed through Alpha dorm 3 times without a good reason. I never got to discuss it and I tried to be as useful as possible for the ship with my ap so I didn't waste any on checking where you came from or where you went, that's kinda eleesha's job but I guess she never did or my info that I gave to Chun never got passed through to her.</p><p>I never checked the logs near frieda though, I should have noticed that you had entered front corridor which is a place you never should have been as a pilot who didn't help with research. To be honest I rejected the idea that mush would convert Frieda when Raluca was afk in a much easier place to spore and she was active so she would have been a mush ally. It's strange to me that you went for Frieda.</p><p>That's also why I was almost convinced Frieda must have been alpha mush when she died and if frieda had been alpha mush then Finola couldn't be mush since ian had a spore on him which couldn't have been from Finola.</p><p>You say you thought you made a huge mistake by saying you relayed neron and got dirty. but I don't think anyone thought you said you got dirty from relaying neron since almost everyone knows that isn't possible. So we just thought. Ah roland relayed neron and after that he did eat and get dirty there. Nobody links those events, that would be silly <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I had a good time though, Only one inactive and the griefer wasn't the most horrible kind of griefing so we had a lively ship, it was lots of fun. My only pet peeve was Raluca who didn't stay in the engine room after I bought a camera for her. If she had been safe the entire ship we might have paid more attention to the unsafe frieda.</p><p>Very well played to you mushies. I enjoy mush who do some thinking and planning and not just go on maniac rampages. It's my first time I get left behind, it was an honor to have been left behind by you guys. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Yeah we should've gotten Raluca early it would've been easy, but Finola had already spored Ian and we thought he was going to be uncovered for longer. Then Raluca FINALLY went back to Engine Room and it was too dangerous to try any maneuvers. Frieda was low hanging fruit and a good target for anonymush, and we already had a spore on Ian so later we could jam him twice in a day and convert, then I could go anonymush.</p><p>Ian, you said you lost a spore eating but I don't think that's possible. I asked on the forums because I'd never heard of it and everyone said there's nothing that removes a spore by eating.</p><p>Also the other thing we did a lot of was bad coordination with humans. I would kill some Hunters, then check online but stay "asleep", let Hua do a bunch of work for me, then I would be free to get up and go "Oh all the Hunters are dead." and then go help "relay" a bunch of stuff and tag/trap people on the way (mostly fails though. I dropped 2 traps and Chun ate one, and nobody touched the other. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/getout.png" alt=":out:" class="tid_ico">) It really helped that others (Raluca and Jin Su) had pretty terrible coordination with others. I know people can't check every hour like some people can, so its hard to blame that on Mush. But Mush can take advantage of it.</p>

                <p>No. I never lost the spore from eating, that'd be impossible. Although it's funny how you arrived to that conclusion.<br>I ate a ration, and used the AP to heal myself in the MedLab. Being a Mycologist, healing takes away spores.<br>Mycologist can be quite handy.</p>
