A great number of active players and superb teamwork.</p><p>In the beginning:</p><p>There were a few interesting developments.</p><p>First, Jin Su stepped out of the bridge, came back in, hugged the cat, left the bridge, and declared that he had gotten dirty from hugging the cat.</p><p>Giole understood that doesn't happen, and immediately pegged Jin Su as a mush. He was promptly killed, and was, indeed, a mush.</p><p>Raluca took down a camera from one of the dorms. We then killed her. She wasn't mush. Still don't know what that was about.</p><p>Chao did some griefing and attacked people at random. We also took him out. This put Giole in command.</p><p>Our research team was on fire, and flew through research. I got the genome disk from Xyloph and they completed the pheromodem. We then knew that the final mush was either Ian or Hua, and that they had spiked Terrence. As Ian had been in the lab the whole time and was instrumental in speeding through the research we quickly concluded the Hua was mush.</p><p>We killed her and were mush free.</p><p>Giole organized our efforts and the entire crew worked as a team. We planned out maximizing efficiency to finish Plasma Shield and Pilgred. We planned expeditions and got extra resources. Including two jumpkins which, which are extra hydropot project, led to us creating a very AP productive garden.</p><p>This crew was amazing! This was a ship that could make it all the way to Eden!</p><p>Then tragedy struck. Our expedition team was built around Finola--she had diplomacy, so we didn't have to worry about combat. then she got lost. The combats that then happened killed Kuan-Ti and hurt the rest of the expedition team. On the first expedition they did not recover Finola.<br><br>As I understand it, a second attempt was made. The expedition team suffered some pretty hard damage. The thought that was with magnetic return the ship could be moved and Icarus would return with the team. That was not the case, and the expedition team was abandoned.<br><br>This was devastating to morale. To make matters worse, Chun and Janice had been inactive the whole game. They had been kept alive through rebel base morale boosts and scheduled healings from our medics to deal with starvation damage.<br><br>We decided Eden was no longer a realistic possibility but if we were going to return to Earth we'd return with all the anti-mush research we could have.<br><br>Through constant fires, hunter attacks, and damaged equipment we finished nearly all the research and returned to Sol.<br><br>Amazing crew, the best I've ever played with.</p>

                <p>As you guys painfully learned, Magnetic return gets the Icarus back, but not the crew on it. Some people consider that a useless project, or valuable only if an expo goes totally south, stranding the Icarus on the planet with a dead crew, thus no one to return the Icarus to the landing bay.</p>

                <p>Terrence here.<br>Actually we lost and found Finola in one exploration. She got lost in one of first zones, and we found her before the end. But team wasn't prepared to travel without diplomat, they had post-it-notes instead of blasters, and planet was a pretty dangerous. So by the time when Finola been found, Kuan has died, and Roland lost almost all hp, thats why we tried to return them - any more damage could increase number of victims.<br>Notes to self: magnetic return useless(we got a ship, but what point of it, without expo team and equipment?); give compass to diplomat, not a pilot;</p>

                <p>Hey guys, Finola here.</p><p>Here is the deal from my Prospective.</p><p>When i arrived to ship i noticed already, that there was mush sample and apron, which i used to force research. With a little help from Ian we rushed it. After that we cooped to do mycoalarms, which we did almost in 1 day.</p><p>During this research strange things happed to other crew (we (RT) don't really care about it, because we were busy with (SCIENCE (me) and Plants (Ian) <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>After we got disk, i decided to rush pheromodem (i thought it would give us some inside of mush tactics but it gives us that Ian/Hua spiked Terrence). So i checked logs and it shows, that Ian left bridge ~13h ago (same as contamintation time). So it was actually 50/50 and the coin tossed to Hua death <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico">. The result of - i got lucky and we killed the last mush.</p><p>We thought that cat is spike, but actually i think it wasn't but i wouldn't touch this mess anyway <img src="../../../../gfx/square/surprised.png" alt="8D" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>After the death of last mush - survival begins. We had a few problems with Chun and Janice, but we got lucky, that Paola got medic and Biologist books. My initial thought that we would give medic book to Ian, that will help RT to research faster. But medic book was taken by Stephen, which makes me mad for a bit <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico">, but turns out that we could heal Chun and Janice more oftern (Chun was at kitchen and Janice in Alpha Dorm).</p><p>So we started doing expos each day which drains a lot of my ap and slows some key research, but we did lenses and Meridon Scrambler and projects team did trail minimizer, which helped us a bit in saving ap. <br> <br>Giole did a great job in Commanding the ship, givin each team a task for a day, so we managed to repair PILGRED and finished all usefull research and projects (Tbh i wanted to do all of mush research (i was a bit glorymonger <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>And here comes almost the end of out Journey (so we came to this non o2 planet). It's all started before the expo, because not all suits were fine. It was a sign. A large sign "TURN BACK AND LEAVE". But we didn't. We wanted damn star map pieces <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">. I got lost on 3rd step. I thought they could find me but they didn't. I gone a bit mad on them, but i couldn't do anything apart crying in chat: bad: What whould be worse? Team got in 3 combat actions which lead to death of KT and 2 HP on Roland and 3 HP Stephen (why we would pick weapons if we have diplo). And roland got a crazy Idea to move the ship (pro tip: IF you have sprinter in land team - you have +1 sector). Well he dodn't knew that. So he decide to leave on planet for a rescuing his ass. I got mad. Really mad. Too good i was found a least, but the ship was moved 3 sec befor next cycle aaaaand... BAM. Dead Screan "You have been abandone" G_G <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> It was so hilarious, i just have no words to describe what i feel. It was a mix between anger and evil laugh. Holy hell, i wish it would gone in other way. I should take that compas <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway, it was a great one. Fine to see such an active crew <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Cya in next game!</p>

We also have a <strong><em>Chun and Janice Healing Documentary</em></strong> Thread, where we log the healing made to them and when is the next healing to be done.</p><p>Having a Mage Book: Technician, Pilgred, Caffeine-Junkie and Auxiliary Terminal, I can work in everything. And we manage to complete 12 projects at Day 8 and 17 researches at Day 10. You guys are awesome.</p><p>What more if I didn't abandon our expo team. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>Well I was under a time-pressure that moment when the last expo gone bad. Finola got lost early. Kuan Ti died from combat. In less than a minute, another two of the expo team might die as well. Our Roland (who I recognized easily) is pretty serious about moving the ship before next step of expo. Then I access the command terminal. Move. OK.<br><em>I feel like I'm detonating a bomb.</em> Boom!</p><p>But the good thing about this team is no one is <em>bitter</em> about what happened. Your Commander didn't falter, that's because you are all there willing to give support.</p>

Team got in 3 combat actions which lead to death of KT and 2 HP on Roland and 3 HP Stephen (why we would pick weapons if we have diplo). And roland got a crazy Idea to move the ship (pro tip: IF you have sprinter in land team - you have +1 sector). Well he dodn't knew that. So he decide to leave on planet for a rescuing his ass. I got mad. Really mad. Too good i was found a least, but the ship was moved 3 sec befor next cycle aaaaand... BAM. Dead Screan "You have been abandone" G_G <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> It was so hilarious, i just have no words to describe what i feel. It was a mix between anger and evil laugh. Holy hell, i wish it would gone in other way. I should take that compas <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></cite><p>For the record, I did know that Sprinter gives +1 zone. The thing was, we were on a very large planet (15 planets!) and the chances of finding you were slim. However, there was a large chance Stephen and I would die anyway. Just one more combat zones or team-wide damage event would have killed us. Stephen would have lost his remaining health, and I would be at best down to 1, but then I would be killed next cycle due to space rabies. I was really mad when I found out the hard way what Magnetic Return really did. However, looking at the chances, Stephen and I would have died anyway. However, you could have survived, so I apologise for dragging you into my crazy plan.</p><p>I certainly a lot from that failed expo. I wish we can all play together someday in the future and make Eden a reality, but it was just not meant to be this time (damn RNG!). Thank you for a wonderful experience! You guys were by far the best crew during and after beta I have ever worked with. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I was Roland by the way. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Stephen here. \o Much apologies for the medbook Finola! I think I was pretty sleepy and rushing so I could get back to sleep when I took it.</p><p>Good to hear what actually happened, as I was still sleeping when that expo was going on. I don't have much to say, but it was a pleasure cooking for you all. This was quite a bit of a learning experience for me as I'm still new to the game and don't know too much, and it was nice to have a ship that was organised, efficient and that I could learn a lot from (Despite me blundering about and managing to mess up a lot of things.). Would be a pleasure to crew with you gents/ladies again.</p>

                <p>Hua here. I knew I had little chance to succeed with anything much as it was my first time mush and, maybe, forth game in total (Jin and I had little conversation). Initially I tried to get my hubster to play me but he found it rather amusing that I had to be mush! Bleh. I hated having to go behind backs and tried to lean back into my role which I created and rather enjoyed (sad she's gone now). Your efficiency was amazing and I knew you'd be sailing the space for a great long time, maybe even reach the ultimate end. Glad to hear your story however unfortunate ending.</p><p>I had decided to go all out, but was late back for cycle change and then I literally sat reading a mush skill guide as Stephen and Gioele knifed me (I learnt this way that the game doesn't update text in real time, something I hadn't realized before). You don't know how lucky you were! &lt;evillaughter-fail&gt;</p><p>As I was more relived getting out (and right back in as mush Raluca for the next game &lt;cry&gt;<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I was glad I didnt sabotage it all for you. Great crew is not all that common as yet (new game, low skills, etc).</p><p>Salutations! Over and out.</p>

                <p>A bit late to the party, but Ian here. Wow, it took me so long to figure out how to find the after-game records, and I still have no idea how to leave that final message in the records.</p><p>That was my second game ever, and there was always so much happening, I sure learned a lot from you guys fast! Hua, I never suspected you at all because you were so helpful in teaching me the ropes of gardening, and I felt like I lost a friend when you turned out to be Mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> If Finola wasn't so efficient at pulling me into the lab and finishing that Pheromodem, you might have been able to do a lot more, especially since your spore spiking got covered up by all the drama that Raluca caused.</p><p>Finola, Roland, Kuan Ti, and Stephen, it was such a shock to us when you guys all just vanished so fast. I still remember those last moments before we took off, Terrence happened to come on just at the right time and Gioele and I were rushing to "save" you all. Like Finola said, if we had been just a few seconds slower, she might have survived. We were so organized that she died <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>However, we knew we had to continue in all your memories, so we quickly made plans to complete your life's work, and finished all the Mush research. We then made preparations to put up statues of each of you in front of your graves, as well as bring Finola's sofa over. Also, we found out the cat was Mush free, and every crew member turned into pumpkins, and then we had a giant banquet in the Lab in your memories before returning to Sol.</p><p>All in all, I think I was super lucky to have played with you guys, it was a crazy trip, a lot crazier than my current ship. Want to know the status of my current ship? We're on Day 3, and everyone is dead except me (and Terrence, who is withering away with multiple diseases and at 1 :moral: while I'm attempting to read a Shrink book and holding his hand and telling him that when we get back to Sol, there will lots of puppies and pizza.</p>
