                <p>Hello to our ex-crew and to any curious onlookers. It's your friendly neighborhood pilot Roland here with an interesting story about one very interesting trip!</p><p>If you were on this crazy boat, feel free to tell your side of the story, fill in blanks, or otherwise chatter about the short, intense voyage we shared. Even if you weren't on the boat you're still welcome to come talk- it's a party in here! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Final ending recap: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1339" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1339</a></p><p>As the title suggests by the end every last one of us was broken or Mush and most of us were insane! We had it all- murders, cabals, intrigue, love, rivalries, <a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/hJs00w/19">a small soap opera</a>, and even a twist ending. This has to be one of the best (and wildest) ships I have been on to date. I couldn't have asked for a better game to play before taking a break from Mush for the holidays.</p><p>Thank you all so much for playing. I hope we'll see each other again on other ships.<br>_______________________________<br>My long-winded tale of the <em>Ship of the Mad</em> will be in the next couple posts. To give you a feel for the level of crazy roleplaying going on, here are some of Janice's (awesome) notes copied from post-it notes found in-game. Warning, there are some spoilers here!</p><p><em>Patient 1 : Roland (Male)</em> Roland seems to believe that reality is simply a game. He demands we say "[[OOC]]" when we speak "out of character". Perhaps this is an onset of Schizophrenia. I will have to keep an eye on it. <br><br><em>Patient 2 : Chao (Male)</em> Highly aggressive individual. Shows signs of bloodlust. Psychopathic tendencies. Cause unknown. More observation is required. <br><br><em>Patient 3 : Chun (Female)</em> Seems to see Mush everywhere. Possibly a psychosis caused by mush contaminants within her body, although perhaps she is displacing her feelings of being a mush onto others, like a classical closet homosexual who acts publicly as a homophobe. Chun has also shown some aggressive behavioral patterns.<br><br><em>Patient 4 : Ian (Male)</em> Ian is unreachable, off on one of his trips no doubt. Could be days before he comes back to reality, hopefully he will not starve from death. What is he hiding from? The mush situation, no he's stronger than that... To explore further <br><br><em>Patient 5 : Gioele (Male)</em> Gioele on the other hand has become fixated with the oxygen tank, I think the decryogenisation has had ill effects on his brain. Another soul lost in this struggle... <br><br><em>Patient 6 : Terrence (Male)</em> Terrence has not fully recovered from the incident, and it seems increasingly unlikely he ever will. He remembers only blurs, he has developed on odd grammar, that of a non-native speaker (which he believes wholly he is) and.. He does not remember us... It does not feel ethical to further investigate the matter, and I don't believe I have the strength to...<br><br><em>Patient 7 : Raluca (Female)</em> Raluca is keeping to her self, given her condition, asociability. It's not that she is antipathetic towards the other members of the crew, simply apathic, she does not care. I need to integrate her however, lest they think she is more than asocial... <br><br><em>Patient 8 : Eleesha ( Female)</em> Eleesha appears to be stable and rational, no major trauma to note. She has developed an odd quirk although, Chronic vertigo. It is all the more bizarre given our current situation, being spacebourne. I plan to appeal to her logical mind to adress this issue. It should not take too long...<br><br><em>Patient 9 : Jin Su (Male)</em> Jin Su is slipping in and out of a comatose. Furthermore he seems to be only able to say hello, and can understand language and all other forms of communication. Clearly Broca and Wernicke's areas have been shut down in his brain. Just what we needed, our commander cracking under the pressure. I will have to talk to Finola with what could possibly be done... Perhaps it is for the better, Chao's thirst for power would be quenched after all...</p>

                <p>Warning, this is LONG. I'll break it up by days. Thanks for being such an awesome, active crew to make this possible! I hope it will help reveal some of the machinations that went on in the background.</p><p>_______________________________________________________________ <br><em>Day one</em> started dull. The ship was slow to fill so I had a few cycles to run around gathering inventory information and putting up cameras. You know, good old regular Roland stuff. There were no hunters and I was feeling fine! I contact Raluca (as is my habit) to team up for PILGRED research then lay down for some rest. Suddenly we got a spike of people joining. Bam! Full ship! Oh, and there's hunters.</p><p>Did I forget to mention I suddenly got the “Welcome to the world of Mush!” message? Yeah, I'm a mush! I scrounge enough AP to get my butt to a turret and kill the remaining hunters, working with Terrance to clear the skies. My primary mission has changed, however... and I suddenly realize how lucky my position really is.</p><p>The rest of the crew comes to life. Kuan Ti takes over as Captain since Jin is asleep at the wheel. Kuan Ti declares his love for NERON and declares that he is supreme god-emperor of the ship so all humans must bow down to him and all Harkonnen must die so the Fremen can live. Janice then is revealed to be trysting with NERON, much to Kuan Ti's rage and Terrance's confusion. In the end, Terrance figures he can share with an AI because he's kinky like that and Kuan Ti is sad that his beloved NERON loves someone else. Chun declares this ship to be mad and rages that we all need to shut up and be sensible. Janice offers counseling services to calm Chun down. Chun Rages.</p><p>Meanwhile, almost hidden by the bizarre love triangle, there's one voice that seems different. It's Finola. She tells us all she's been kidnapped and is being held against her will and not to expect any medical help at all on this voyage. I chime in that I'm not having a good time of it, either, due to being forcibly held against my will by people who wanted me dead. We all just have to make the best of things and pull together or we won't survive, I tell her. Then Kuan Ti opens his mouth, laughing about how it's all his fault we're here and that we need to stop talking and go make him a Pizza.</p><p>“You're aware the coms keep logs, right?”, I say and the channel falls quiet.</p><p>Down in Mush chat we have a good laugh at the crazy, angry humans. Looks like Freida and I are the lucky ones this go round. We quickly brew some plans up and I become the mush leader.<br>_______________________________________________________________</p><p><em>Day Two</em> I work on regaining AP and getting some spores up and running. Helping Raluca reset PILGRED has given me a great excuse to be dirty. Besides, pilots don't need to be clean to work. It was the perfect setup. Even better, Chun and her “Anti-Mush Coalition” contact me saying I'm one of the few trusted souls on the ship. I try to console Chun and get her to calm down, but she's good and mad and ready to stab things. Her first act? Kill Hua, steal the knife. “She was a dumbass anyway” is her reason. Soon afterward Stephen dies of a gun shot to the head.</p><p>Even though I'm not on the hit list, I realize I have a murderous “humanity's last hope” bunking next to me in the dorm. I quietly take the Hard Boiled skill and hope I'm wrong. At the end of the night I bump into a broken door on the way to bed. I think nothing of it, but Eleesha, however, takes notice...</p><p><em><strong>Janice's Notes</strong></em>- Found in Alpha Dorm, written on Day 2</p><p><em>Patient 2 : Chao (Male) UPDATE - I'm unsure if Chao's seemingly psychopathic nature has acted as a sort of enabler for Chun's behaviour, however I'm happy to say that he seems to be getting better. My hacking of Neron to name him commander seems to have paid off. He is calmer and more collected now that he has control and responsibility of the ship. His aggressive nature is still present though but he seems to have sublimated these emotions into a self-assigned mission to serve and protect Chun. It is not a perfect scenario, I would prefer to eliminate such tendencies, but it is acceptable for now. Besides there are more pressing matters. <br><br> I neglected my duty to the crew by focusing on other matters... As I slept, our commander woke from his slumber (cf. notes on Patient 9). This sent Chao into fit of rage in which he sent a bullet into the brains of our cook Stephen. Perhaps the altercation was food related (Chao was contemplating eliminating Paola beforehand for eating too much for his liking). I swore to myself never to abandon a human soul, Chao may become the exception...<br><br>Patient 3 : Chun (Female) UPDATE - Chun is becoming worse as the hours pass, it is as I feared, the aggressive behavioural tendencies have translated into actions with irreversible consequences. Chun murdered a member of the crew. It was an aggravated assault, but no sane person would go to such extremes... <br><br>My hypothesis about displacement seems to be correct as the idea of being mentally unstable seethes into Chun's Mind, she can only refuse it and displace it onto others. She now believes that she is the only sane person left on this ship. I had warned them of the consequences of labeling her "the last hope", her psyche can not take the stress... (I'm not excluding the mush disease's effect on her mind) I must help her see reality, I must! If not for her sake then for the rest of the crew and dare I say it humanity!</em></p>

                <p><em>On Day Three</em> I wake up to being stabbed by Chun and kicked by Eleesha. I stumble out of the dorms bleeding with broken bones and internal hemorrhaging. Luckily, I have plenty of AP. Not so luckily, I quickly find out that broken bones makes EVERYTHING more expensive so that AP isn't as much as it looks. Finola is awake when I tumble into Med bay. I plead for my life, making a case that it's all a mistake and that I have done nothing to hurt the ship!</p><p>My words move Finola and she stands up to axe-crazy Chun, blowing all her AP to save my life. Chun races into Med bay and stabs me with the last of her AP, retiring to the lab for “anti mush research.” Finola collapses in tears, emotionally shattered as she realizes how quickly the crew is devolving into monsters and madness. I'm struck by how beautiful and fragile she is. This human is something amazing, something wonderful. She would hold me as I lay dying. She should not die- she needs to join the family!</p><p>I stagger over to Finola, bleeding out from another hemorrhage, touching her cheek to comfort her. I encourage her to keep fighting, tell her she's wonderful. I mean it- she needs to live so she can be with me forever. She dries her eyes and spends some klix to save my life. Everything is covered in blood, but I'm not dead. She reveals she almost give me a lethal injection but didn't because she believes in me. I hold her until the tears stop.</p><p>God-Emperor Kuan Ti comes online and demands the killing stop right NOW while proper investigations take place. Janice is impressed by his god-like command of the ship and swishy cape. They make googly eyes and decide to go out for “coffee”. I'm ordered to leave Raluca alone because he'll reset PILGRED for now. I need to do pilot stuff and help them research anti-spore soap I take this time to chat up the crew and convince them I'm not Mush; I just have bad timing. The bad timing part is true, the not mush part... not so much. Much to my shock, it works. Chun drops her weapon and the “Anti Mush Coalition” stops trying to kill me. Suddenly Eleesha starts looking very suspicious: all these dead humans and no dead mush!</p><p>Chun sits there bewildered for a bit, not sure who to trust anymore. Kuan Ti accuses Chun of trying to overrule the ship's god with her murder spree and she replies that the voices in her head say she's not a god. Terrence tries to make sense of things, but gives up and retreats into a corner. Astonishingly, Raluca becomes the voice of reason, blaming post traumatic stress for the breakdown of most of the crew. Suddenly I realize the crazy cat lady is the sanest human left. I don't regret the decision to make her a primary target.</p><p>I spend a little time pretending to be human and make dinner for Raluca, dropping it off in the rear corridor. Good old fashioned Sol cooking with a little spores for spice. I also run some materials around and take out the Pasiphae to look extra clean and boy-scout. Finola is depressed, I speak to her sweetly. She must live. <br>_______________________________________________________________</p><p><em>On Day Four</em> Kuan Ti resets PILGRED and sees firsthand that I wasn't lying about it making you dirty. I also mention I'm willing to go back to resetting PILGRED for Raluca and drop the hint that this is where my AP was going as she generally needs a reset 2-3 times a day. Kuan Ti finally relents. I quickly finish off Raluca and take Anonymush. Another has joined the family.</p><p>I try going to Bravo dorm but it's full. I backtrack to Alpha and Janice starts screaming at me, calling me a pervert. Now, I know we had a bit of a rub earlier because I said Finola was pretty and didn't compliment her, too, but this seems silly. Kuan Ti taps my shoulder and reveals it's “Coffee time” again so I head back to Alpha and check room logs. Eleesha has been “sleeping” since yesterday, cycle two. I ask Eleesha to let me have the bed and, much to my surprise, she does.</p><p>Three minutes later NERON chimes out the news: Kuan Ti and Janice are dead. Eleesha went nuts and killed them in cold blood, calling them Mush sympathizers. Her only reply to the death announcement of Kuant Ti? “Hey... Listen... You guys hear that? Neither do I. “</p><p>In the confusion, Raluca steals some oxygen. Five cycles left to live! Finola has had all she can take and wishes she could overdose on pills. I call to her sweetly, ask her to come to me so I can hold her while she lies dying and say I know she would do the same for me. I tell her she's wonderful, beautiful, and that if we make it to the morning we'll both be feeling better. I mean it. I know more than one way to deliver a spore...</p><p>She comes to me. “Make love to me, Roland.” And we do. She falls asleep beside me with the camera off. Raluca controls the fuel and oxygen and Frieda controls the star charting. We have the ship in lockdown and the girl is mine. Everything is beautiful, until Eleesha starts squawking again.</p><p>“I DIE PROUD. I DIE FREE. I DIE A HUMAN. ANTI-MUSH LEAGUE FOREVER!!”</p><p>“YOUR ANTI MUSH LEAGUE CAUSED THE DEATH OF HUMANITY! CUT THE CRAP.”, Finola hisses rolling out of bed.</p><p>“Mandatory Executions will be held midday tomorrow! All crew members excluding Chao and Chun will draw a number from the pool! Mandatory breeding will be instated! League members get first rights!”</p><p>“Tomorrow? You wont live until tomorrow!” Finola cries just as NERON declares her to be new Captain. Jin Su is dead. Finola's first order as a captain was simple: “<em><strong>GUT HER LIKE A FISH!</strong></em>” Even without the orders from my special one I still would have gladly killed Eleesha. New wounds for old wounds.</p><p>We chased her down to the Rear Bravo turret. Finola was shouting, furious and so full of fire. Oh yes, I picked the right one! Eleesha dodges down the hall away from Finola, just barely ahead of me. NERON is announcing deaths: Chun and Raluca. Rest well little sister. Over the intercom I hear Eleesha's laughter.</p><p>“Your Empress is dead. She has shed her mortal form. She is now a GOD! She demands human sacrifices at midnight! All crew members including league members will draw staws.”</p><p>I corner Eleesha in the central corridor. She turns to me. It's clear she has finally lost what little sanity was left. “As her most trusted priestess. I will be the first to be sacrificed. It is truly a great honor!”</p><p>I take out a little souvenir I picked up while running through storage and pull the pin. Eleesha is splattered across the walls. The Anti-Mush Coalition is over.</p><p>The air is thinning now. I am holding out as best as I can. There's the door to the turret where Finola lies still, conserving oxygen. I come to Finola's side and I hold her as the ship is dying. I'm not sad: all missions were accomplished and we'll live on in the spores of our children. Freida is crashing the ship into a planet for us. See you next life, love...<br> <br><em>GAME OVER- MUSH WINS!</em></p>

                <p>Ahh here it is, the promise thread <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Your love, Finola here.</p><p>What an amazing ship was that! Damn. Only 4 days, but it feels like our voyage was a lot longer. Everything was just happening so fast!</p><p>I was very surprised to see such high amount of great roleplayers in one place! I mean, usually there are few IC posts around but most of the stuff is OOC. Thats why when Roland offered to use [OOC] tag I thought it was totally unnecessary. But this time it was different: 95% of all the things said were IC ! Thats like being in a movie. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br>All the drama and bossing around that was going on made the game feel like a totally different thing, very immersive. People were driven by thoughts and reactions and not game mechanics. Maybe thats why we died because oxygen level came to an end... Certain people got hooked by what was going on in their minds, and some were just crazy, and everybody forgot about really important stuff... Honestly I realy thought we could even go to that 1st expo to grab Hydracarbonade when we had 9 Oxygen left, and then take care of 02 levels. And we would do that if Anti-Mush league would think straight.<br><br>Kuan Ti, you were hilarious, excellent portrayal of the character. -woosh- lol. <br>Janice, wow, when I saw your notes i was like O_O whaat, shes really is a shrink! Never saw that stuff coming. Unbelievable.<br>Roland.... damn you.... you...! Ugh.. I don't know what to say. I can't believe you were Mush. Jesus... we did it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> When Roland came in the medlab all wounded, Im pretty sure If I had decided to kill him, one punch would have been enough. But at that point I was too crushed by all the murders without reasons so I couldn't loose another guy. Didn't use klix though <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Medic gave me 5hp heal and I had almost full AP, so it was enough to perform 2 separate surgeries and heal some massive amout of hp, even after Chun came in again and stabbed him a few times. <br>Eleesha and Chun... Seriously, I wanna know what the hell was going on in your twisted minds! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> <br><br>Oh yea, after Janice and Kuan died, I decided Eleesha had to pay for what she had done and went after her, to the kitchen. Punched a few times, she then went off to try to hide in Icarus bay but I tracked her and attacked again, then she proceeded to the turret and then i was out of AP. Im glad Roland got her before we all died. <br><br>I wish id have this kind of ship some time again, where AP and MP spent for RP reasons and not just game routine, and people are only talking in character. Best game ever! Thanks guys.<br><br>Roland you... YOU. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p>

We Mush decided to take the "hard route" of <em>not </em>being nasty and destructive. We decided early on to be kind, helpful, and friendly in the hopes we could blend in well enough to be able to return to Sol. The turn order was going to go like this: Me &amp; Freida -&gt; Raluca -&gt; Finola -&gt; Terrence -&gt; Captain (with our powers combined!). The only reason we sabotaged the oxygen at the end was because the "Anti-Much Coalition" drained too much resources from the ship and we knew the crew probably wouldn't be able to find a planet with oxygen in time because of it.</p><p>In short, we went from "friendly alien bodysnatchers" to "merciful death".

Due to the friendly mission he really, really wanted you to stay alive and happy so you could be happy together in your brand new, far more peaceful, Mush existence without worries about age, hunger, or sorrow ever again. <br><br>Roland Mush saw humans as monsters for being so violent and distrusting. Then along comes sweet little Finola who is trusting, believes in the good of the whole, and is so kind-hearted she is willing to cradle a dying (possible) enemy. She was so "human" she was perfect for the new, kinder, mush world! Finola's final words only made it more perfect...<br><br><em>We let delusional psychopaths takeover the ship... Seeing all the blood spilled for nothing, all the pain they've caused to hurt their own cause, makes me think that Mush world can't be that horrible. Humans are the most evil species in this universe - humans like Chun, Eleesha and Chao. Maybe we deserve the end... They sure did.</em><br><br>In-character craziness aside, I had a ton of fun roleplaying with you. You made a great doctor and a great "wifey". <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Knowing you didn't actually spend klix to save me makes me feel much better inside. I was feeling a little guilty from an OOC standpoint. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/omg.png" alt=":omg:" class="tid_ico"> I also fully agree that having another ship where AP/MP is spent for in-character reasons and everyone roleplays more would be wonderful!<br><br>Honestly I don't think we had any bad active roleplayers! Crazy God-Emperor Kuan Ti was fun to play off of. Janice's obliviousness to her own madness even as she wrote about how we all were mad was perfect. Chao's dogged loyalty was a refreshing change from the usual "KILL EM ALL" most people follow. Chun was just plain disturbing: a perfect counterpoint to the peaceful Mush! Poor Terrence was just trying to get along and point a fellow pilot in the right direction. Meanwhile Hua was VERY peeved that her student was giving HER orders! <br><br>I can't wait for castings to come to English server. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
