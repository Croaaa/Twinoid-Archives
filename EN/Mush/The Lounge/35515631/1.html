                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2357">Stephen here</a></p><p>I couldn't resist the title, especially due to how much of a chess game it turned out to be closer towards the end. I was relying on many of my fellow crewmates to pull through for me, and it's depressing that things didn't work out and our activity level dropped off a cliff towards the end.</p><p><strong>Day 2</strong> Both Ian and Finola were discovered as Mush today. Now, there's an interesting thing about this whole thing, and that was that we decided we couldn't kill Ian. Ian also decided that he couldn't really do much against us, so instead of playing typical Mush, he offered us a deal with a set of rules that he would follow as Mush, and a set of rules we would follow as humans. Gun was off, the race began. Our objective? To create the cure and cure Ian before he spored us to completion. There were additional rules, but that sums it up pretty fast.</p><p>Days 3 and 4 had little to no affect on anything, really, to be honest. We tried to work on the cure, but didn't get xenoph disk until it was late, and Chun wouldn't cooperate enough to work on the cure...</p><p><strong>Day 5</strong> was when shit hit the fan. Chun died from injuries that never ended up healed. Deal was off. It was an actual all out slug out fest to see if we could kill Ian and get home without dying first, and we were at only 50 hull. Our initial plan rested on Jin Su and Paola rushing the Natamy rifle, before Frieda and I would shoot Ian to death in the dorms, focusing on right before cycle change. However things didn't go as planned. Hunters warped in and ripped our hull down to 15. We warped out, and more hunters appeared. Suddenly everything was on a time crunch, and we had three hours to go. Everything seemed like it'd be over soon.</p><p>We survived the <strong>day 6</strong> turnover, never having completed the Natamy rifle nor the cure. In fact, in terms of research and projects, this ship was very subpar, having completed no researches and only 4 projects by the end, and two of those from neron updates. However, Ian made a mistake.</p><p>He climbed into a patrol ship and shot at the Daedalus.</p><p>We figured that was it, we could end it right there. Raluca and I relayed a little over Pilgred and the reactor was done. We ignored aracks, trax, hunters, whatever, and warped home. Game was over.</p><p>But we didn't know that Frieda was a Mush. Frieda had been turned a while back, apparently, and was an anonymush. Yet, we never knew. We ended up going home with an anonymush on our backs and it was declared a Mush win.</p><p>The reason why this is a discovered checkmate is because we never suspected Frieda. In fact, it was very cleverly played by both Ian and Frieda and felt much more fun to me than the average boring fare of normal Mush ships. My only regret was failing to kill Ian, but I suppose this is an interesting enough end for me too.</p>

                <p>Hah, this looks like it was a lot of fun! Ian is my <em>favorite</em> char to be a mush on. No one wants to kill him and he doesn't want to kill anyone, so you always have to think outside of the box. I'd so love to play something like this if I could.</p><p>One thing though that you might have noticed by now that I've just learned - The end result shows Ian as having returned to Sol. I guess going to Sol doesn't kill anyone out in space?</p>

                <p>You totally should have murdered him from the start <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Even with Plastenite Armor and Hard Boiled, killing mush Ian [or mush hanging out with Ian] is doable if you have access to the knife and coordinate your attacks properly. Shooter points and grenades [requires BIOS changes] make a difference too. It's quite a bit of AP but no more than what it would take to do Natamy rifle and use it.</p><p>Compare that to your goal of completing the mush serum: alot of xyloph work, one dead mush and Chun activity [or even more xyloph work] just to be able to start. Couple that with the fact that this project is literally just as slow as doing PILGRED efficiency-wise, I'd say you got a raw deal <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Still, I'd take a game like this over these marathon ships any day.

                <p>Interesting thing about that was that (for all the activity we supposedly had) It felt very much like a skeleton crew. Chao was inacto, Jin wasn't high enough to have shooter, no one had shooter, so we had to rely on ridiculous AP costs. Xyloph work wasn't hard (we got lucky and obtained it really early) and Chun was (supposedly) active when we started cure work, but then proceeded to disappear and never really show up again.</p><p>Raluca also dropped the grenade (which Ian picked up) and Ian never dropped it until after the deal was broken, and that was so he could throw it at Raluca (where it fizzled out and did nothing)</p>
