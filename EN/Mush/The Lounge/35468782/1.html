                <p>Now that <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2305">that's</a> over with, let's get down to business.<br>I was your gardener, Ian. This ship looked like it was capable of great things, although it was hindered by a Janice who went inactive on the bridge, and a few other minor inactives.<br>Things started out well, although it took a while to connect to Sol. Once that was done, I spent a good portion of time sleeping and gardening, occasionally bumping research and projects. It got to the point where we found an almost ideal planet: meat, more meat, oxygen, fruits, and no major, instadeath possibilities. We made it to the planet, only for me to realize that I had never seen the hacker kit throughout the entire voyage...<br>I convinced the crew to postpone the expedition until we had the hacker kit safely tucked away somewhere, and Eleesha began looking. However, Freida soon became suspcious due to the fact that Eleesha had printed the list without telling anyone who was on it... There was an argument, and Eleesha lost. Evidently, she converted Freida, and that was the end of that. Or so we thought. Not too long after, we recieved a notice saying that Pilgred had been completed by Freida, despite Raluca's promise to stop at 75% or so. in addition, Freida had used slime trap, making me dirty. It didn't take long before she was killed... However, not too much later, Eleesha and Raluca both mutated and ran off. everyone who was active at the time ran off and hid in the medbay with Chun, guarded by my Hippy aura. The scene seemed slightly reminiscent of a typical horror movie, complete with the monster being not quite dead at the end. Eventually, Jin Su and Finola killed the two mush, and we resumed our business. However, Chun had suffered injuries during the attack and had two injuries. I made a mistake, and she died because of me... Later I noticed that Chao had brought a book to the engine room, where Freida had read it... There wasn't a book there now, though, and nobody had picked it up... <br>I reported this to the crew, although nobody seemed to care. However, Chao spoiled his mushiness by spiking and transferring to Jin Su. Jin su (as Chao) then proceeded to kill himself and went on tomove the freezer to the Icarus bay. In the engine room, I had found a hidden hacker kit, so I told the crew and stashed it somewhere so we could go on an expedition.<br>The expedition went pretty well, although NONE of the four fruits we managed to bring back were any better than bananas, ranging from not healing you to only giving you AP and a nasty tapeworm infestation. I went to sleep and awoke the next morning to see that we had moved and had prepared to move again, due to the hunters.<br>However, the hunters proved too much for us and we returned to Sol without the Serum...<br>That's my side of the story. Feel free to share yours, and help yourself to the fruit. Just avoid that Precati. It's secretly a tapeworm nest.</p>
