We found out on this ship that when you’re in need of a planet with a specific thing, all you need to do is to get a pumpkin head and you shall find what you need. After 3 expos where our oxygen pump jammed (thanks to a mush traitor…) and Frieda wasn’t finding a good planet for us to go, I went to give it a try, ate a jumpkin and found the most perfect planet ever. Very safe, few food and artifacts zones and the precious o2. Some days later we were in urgent need of HC so Frieda decided to become a believed of the power of the pumpkinheads, she ate one jumpkin and of course she found us a wonderful planet full of HC.</p><p>But now for a small recap of major events</p><p><strong>Chao’s death</strong>. - As Janice, I started by becoming incredibly happy to see an active Jin Su doing speeches very early on. As the crew started waking up, we were seeing some people that knew what to do but some others that were completely clueless like Chao that was almost finishing some useless project in nexus instead of oxygenated ducts. We all gathered to try to save the ducts and we were able to finish them even before everyone was awake. But Chao was marked as a possible griefer already since he was also holding Schrodinger and had no walkie. I tried to whisper to him asking if he was a new player and needed help but was met with silence. On day 2 he then decided to work on another random neron project instead of a more important one and we decided to kill him, fearing he would end up working on something like pneumatic distributor while plasma shield was up. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Stephen and the pilot book</strong> - We had 5 pilots at the start of the game since everyone that could have the skill, had it. And then when the game actually started, we got a pilot mage book. As soon as I finished saying that no one should read the book without the crew agreeing, Stephen (that wasn’t a chef!) read it and became immediately suspected. He then pulled some weight shooting hunters so we lowered our suspicions.</p><p><strong>Paola’s death</strong> - Paola started the game being an active player, putting cameras in dorms and doing some organization threads. Then, after mush were assigned she was barely speaking, she went to the bridge where she had her sofa and did absolutely nothing in comms during the first two days. This behavior was screaming “MUSH” and we quickly killed her only to realize she was human. I never understand why such a big change in behavior…</p><p><strong>Roland the mush</strong> - Roland seemed to be a newbie player that wasn’t being that much helpful. He got dirty on day 1 cooking, he got dirty on day 2 loading 1 fuel when we needed 6 and got dirty on day 3 (i think) cooking again and then announced he would be away for some days because he was traveling. We were already suspecting he could be mush but after his name was on Eleesha’s list together with mine (that was a negative on xyloph), Finola’s (that we trusted) and Terrence’s (that we also had no reasons to suspect he was mush) we were sure it was him. We had the natamy riffle and I had the pleasure of using it for the first time to get us rid of Roland.</p>

                <p><strong>Finola accidentally killing Stephen</strong> Stephen told us he only had 3hp left. We told him what he could do to get healed and after walking around for a while he picked up the medikit and went to medlab and took the bed there. H wasn’t very talkative but we assumed he had healed himself once with the medikit. And Finola took that assumption one step further, she was annoyed to not have her bed so she kicked him once to get him out of bed. We get immediately a warning that Stephen had been assassinated. We were getting ready for an expo but I immediately took the natamy riffle and went to medlab to see what had happened. Finola explained it was an accident and we were leaning to trust her. But she had picked the armor right before hitting him so all of it looked a bit weird. She volunteered for a food test and while I usually don’t agree with mush testing, since it was such a weird situation and she was volunteering, I went to get food for the test. she then said she would do the test next cycle because she was out of ap… My riffle was getting itchy and I was refreshing the page several times waiting for her to something mushy… but I’m glad I had patience. After remembering that you don’t need ap to eat, she took a pill and a ration making me very relieved to confirm she was human.</p><p><strong>Curing Hua</strong> As days went by and with one mush dead we still had the second mush to find. We had some main suspects due to their lower efficiency/odd behavior: Gioele first, Ian, Raluca. After day 4 I started going to the refectory every day and saw that Hua never went there. We thought she could be eating some of the fruit from expos but no one ever saw her eating (although apparently I wasn’t keeping a good track of fruit in icarus and she ate some there). So I started suspecting her. Then we had some terrible luck with expos, 3 jammed oxygen pumps (although Hua wasn’t in 1 of the expos), one expo where Frieda almost died (and that Hua launched while I was dealing with the Finola situation so they went on an expo with 3 people, few weapons and no diplomat…). Then at one time Frieda saw in the mycoscan that she had one spore that she had probably got in a trapped bravo bay. Gioele had passed by the bay before to go to a turrent and Hua had entered the bay and left right after for no apparent reason. To me all was evidence enough that Hua was mush and we decided to finish the serum fast and use it on her. One cycle before we cured her, I got scared that Jin Su was mush, he had eaten a jumpkin one cycle before and had no pumpkin head. No one knew if he had gotten it at all and got cured in cycle change or if he never had it at all. So we planned the cure of Hua without telling Jin Su about it and we were very happy when, after being cured, Hua told us there were no mush left. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Final Days</strong> After having no mush left, we entered in survival mode. We had plenty of oxygen, we were finding fruit and food in expos, hull and plasma shield were almost maxed but we started running low on fuel and some of the people became less and less active. We also lost Kuan Ti at one point, he had 6 hp left and asked for healing. He was on a different dorm so I told him I could heal him next cycle and he got a steep plate during cycle change. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> Gioele also died with a steel plate on the last day (but he was very inactive/uncommunicative anyway). We weren’t having that much luck with expos, even after having no traitor. We were suffering lots of accidents, not finding that much fuel and didn’t find any star map fragment. So we decided to go back to sol before we started losing more people due to lower activity.</p><p><strong>Final Comments</strong> I had a great time on this ship, I never went to day 10 with a ship in such a good condition. The mush hunt was also fun and it was my first ship where we cured one mush. Special mention to Jin Su and Frieda, with whom I talked the most. Frieda was finding us new planets to go all the time and driving everyone to do what was needed. Jin Su did an excellent job, he was always there to move the ship when we needed him. Finola, Terrence, Kuan Ti and Chun also did a great job. Hua was very sneaky as mush and I can’t imagine being easy to be almost alone as mush for so long with an active crew like we were. I was very happy we cured instead of killing her because she was such a great help for the ship. Ian wasn’t really very communicative and we suspected him for a while because he didn’t seem to be working very efficiently but ended participating more as days went by. Eleesha didn’t talk much due to language barriers but after being appointed comms officer she did a great work there. Gioele I’m not sure what we was doing besides walking around the ship… Raluca was apparently being played by someone with some experience in the game but that was a terrible team player.</p>

                <p>Hello, this is your captain speaking. The captain who have never made any real decision by himself <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This is a very nice and quite detailed recap for the highlights and I am really grateful for this thread to be made, lol. Also, this is my first journey to be recapped in an AP thread. Could be reading this again in the future, intriguing experience <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now my thoughts:</p><p>From the first day as Jinsu, I tried my best to appear GREAT, RELIABLE, and EXPERIENCED (I was a newbie with only 4 ships under my belt and never have I played as the commander). Fortunately I didn't need to keep that fake image for too long as I realized early that I have two very reliable crewmates <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Janice was the first one I started to trust aside from Chun, and I was suspecting Frieda a bit when she and Janice had a little debate over something which I could not quite remember; but then she was proven human after eating twice. Also, after Frieda was proven 100%; I was relying on her heavily on every decision which was to be made, it seems like she was actually the ship's captain - I was only her 'hands'. Not that I hate it though, I don't like making decisions - too much burden <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>After that, I was suspecting Finola based on the way she speak in the private channel; I only discuss these suspicions with Frieda since she was active and she was already proven. I was already at 90% sure Finola was a Mush when the accident with Stephen happened, might have killed Finola if it was on other ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>About Eleesha, tried to talk to her via private channel everytime we need her to do things. I was not expecting any response but fortunately she was cooperative and I like her consistent work and she was always precise on the time she said she would come online. She was reliable.</p><p>Gioele and Stephen were also somewhat reliable, they did whatever I requested via private channel without any objection. Thanks Gioele for the sofa, thanks Stephen for the hunters sweep. Unfortunately, Gioele's online time was decreasing significantly day by day, and Stephen got an unfortunate accident <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> , no hard feelings to Finola <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Raluca, why you do this to us? Why were you so difficult? Well, you are Raluca, can't blame you for not being a team player, lol</p><p>Ian and Kuan Ti, we had not had the chance to interact much in the ship. Actually, I met both of you only once? or twice? I do remember seeing both of you in one of the dorm though <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink2.png" alt=":wink:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Chun, I think you idled too much. You need to be more active and be a detective, you are the last hope of humanity <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Hua, you were indispensable for the team even from when you were still a Mush. You took care of the plants and you were the regular expo pilot. I did not suspect you at all.</p><p>Terrence, your drones rocks! Was my first time seeing the drones actually being useful. If they were bad, I've seen many worse <img src="../../../../gfx/square/keepcool.png" alt=":K" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Janice and Frieda, thanks for being patience with me. I often asked many newbie questions, I might have got confused and messed up big time if both of you were not on the ship.</p><p>I do really hope to meet you guys again some other time.</p>

                <p>Finola here, great ship guys! Can't believe you though I may be Mush given how much research I was pumping out without much support; and I wasn't dirty for 9 days - hehe. Totally get why I looked bad after bumping off Steven though... Lot's of new players who hopefully got a lot of experience from the game. Been on holidays so got a lot less access to Mush in the last few days...</p>

                <p>hi, your mush here, also known as hua.</p><p>thanks for this thread, janice / nepsy.</p><p>at the beginning all went reasonable well for the mush case. but then roland stopped playing and shortly you researched spore sucker and you cleaned yourself. a-argh. all my hard sneaky work was away - i think i infected 4 people. at that time i was very close to reveal myself and end the game for me. then i started again with terrence, but frieda interfered and got that one spore which helped you a lot. i was very close to convert terrence, he had two spores and i had one in hand, i was waiting for next wave of hunters ... and then .. i was not mush anymore. it was surprise for me, i knew i was suspect, but not that you were so close.</p><p>just to put some light on mush events: i did not pick traitor skill at first, i choose trapper and kitchen and splash. i left one skill slot free for anonymush in case of converting someone. i picked up traitor only for the last expedition, when we were really low on oxygen. and it did not work, we got the oxygen 8(. previous accidents and failures were just normal game.</p><p>next time as a mush i have to be more visible when eating. but i think that against good organized crew with that food test mush has no chance. two active people who prove they are not (alpha) mush and wins trust of chun can monitor whole ship really tightly.</p><p>but it was fun ship, evading your detective work was challenging. hope to meet you again.</p><p><img src="http://www.kadokado.com/gfx/smileys/bookmarked.gif" alt=":kk_like:" class="tid_ico"></p>
