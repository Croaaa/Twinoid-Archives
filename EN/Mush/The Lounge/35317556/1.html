                <p>(Gioele)</p><p>Forum was near non functional towards the end. One of the biggest things I learnt on this ship is that I never want to be a planet scanner again, will go back to being a pilot in future <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> Glad everyone made it through those last days.</p><p>Was really harsh that we lost Jin Su on an expedition, basically got the worst result on each zone, the planet was relativly safe, but sometimes luck is just against you. Only real down point for me.</p><p>The whole crew was good, research and projects were finished pretty damn quick, as were coms. Janice did her best to die of depression towards the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> but no one but a mostly afk Frieda died from depression, so it all worked out in the end. Oh also Chun/Chao mush hunt team was great, killed Roland on the 1st day and identified Stephen for the cure.</p><p>Awful time with getting star map pieces, could have done with the mythical white flag as Janice only unlocked Diplomacy in the last few days of the journey. I swear Crystalite zones don't exsist, I never saw one in my 60 planets scanned..</p><p>Looking forward to atleast one more Hua info dump <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>MMM2 Ship report, Hua point of view</p><p>Its going to be long sorry, but i was a long ship too!</p><p><strong>Day 1</strong><br>Awake ! everyone is chatting and waiting in the lab for the last members of the crew to join and to get the commander speech, Roland opens a MMM thread. Once the last 2 members join, almost everyone leave the lab at once to go search the ship or start working. Gioele has setup 5 camera, 2xdorms, engine room, lab, bridge, Chun will take the medlab bed as there is no camera in it.</p><p>The dorms are packed with people, for the first time there is no bed for all and there is discussions on who should get to have a bed. One of the shower is dismantled.</p><p>There is doubts on finola, because she researched without apron and got dirty, so I get the medkit and check her health to see if the shower damaged her, she’s in perfect condition, so I check the other members of the crew in dorms and Roland is the only one hurt, no metal plate or anything it seems! I ask Chao and Chun about it, Chao torture Roland and finds out that he showered without telling anyone and .. extracted a spore! Roland is killed in his sleep, leaving the ship with only one pilot, collected scraps and sofa was built shortly (really sorry for you Roland, you had no time to do anything, kinda low to check with medkit but i couldn’t resist, should have phagocyted one of these spores after shower or waited until everyone is hurt a little <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> )</p><p>Chun was the obvious person to trust but for Chao it was a gamble, turned out pretty good, had the feeling he was human because of his implication. After that Chao, Chun and I investigated more, trusting each other, we found none else hurt after showering or doing anything suspicious so we started to think that our mush is either not acting, or waterproof. We kept a channel with just us 3 and created another to invit newly trusted people to.</p><p><strong>Day 2</strong><br>The hull took a beating from a wave of hunters over night and I struggled to finish them. Fortunatly, the gathered scraps were used by Terrence to repair the hull. At this point I don’t see the ship going very far because of the lack of pilot and i start to be afraid because im probably the best candidate for a mush kamikaze kill.</p><p>Frieda found us a nice planet and we started the exploration in 2 parts, on day 2 and the second day 3. Chun got the hacker kit and armor on her and Jinsu was always coming because I didnt want to be abandoned on a random planet (even though he was on the “trusted chat” the mush could have transferred in him, by day 3, we had almost full air, full fuel , a lot of extra rations and even an artifact to speed up researchs (printed circuits jelly). I got “lucky” to catch a skin inflammation on the first exploration, so im one of the least suspicious person on the ship with Chao and Chun.<br>Janice went to open space capsules and load a fuel she found in them into the engine, for no good reason, just loading 1 fuel in the chamber instead of the tank, as we needed more to reach a planet only caused confusion, she did not get dirty luckily but we now keep an eye on her.</p><p>A few persons are hugged by Chao when they walk by showers, including Jinsu and Stephen, but maybe more, our Chao is very moderate though, he’s not the usual Chaopath but people avoid getting dirty near him <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">.</p><p><strong>Day3</strong><br>Mycoscan is done and all the crew report having no spore but Eleesha who is not moving from lab the whole day and Chun of course. Eleesha has been acting strange, she does not talk to anyone, even Chun, she just walk around the ship searching, discovering mycoalarms hidden by Chun, even after being asked not to search anymore, she earn the title of searchbot for her accomplishments, im very tempted to kill her but Chao and the hope of the printed list is stoping me.</p><p>Im relieved to have 0 spores, I tell myself that a waterproof mush with trap could have very easily turned me by targeting the patrolers im the only one to use. After that im getting more and more paranoid since our mush isn’t sporing and is now blocked by all the researchs, im afraid he will figure out that taking out the only pilot will ensure the ship to at least not last long, so I keep bugging Ian to come in the same dorm as me, I think he is tired of being called back as soon he goes out of dorm but seriously that guy need sometime 2 or 3 full cycles to go water plants, is he smoking them too? Or is he working secretly on that narcotics distiller he want so badly?(sorry Ian, loved having your protection in the beginning, I think it was a critical moment.)</p><p>The only other person who looked suspicious on day 3 is Janice, again, who took the cat out of lab for a walk while working on NCC lenses, we stoped the research on NCC and finished the mycoscan first after the incident to check the cat. Right after this, Janice who was supposed to go back in dorm to keep Raluca morale from lowering, stoped moving and idled in lab .Chao worked his magic with the poor Janice and it appeared that she did not spore the cat, she did not go in the dorm with the shower for a very long time, so we are left with no real suspect, we just now know Janice likes to have walks and randomly stop in odd places. I have no proof but something tells me Janice isn’t our mush, she just did a few mistakes one after the other. On the other hand I have a bad feeling about Eleesha who is now not moving, still not talking but to Chao saying that she might just destroy the tabulatrix list once she print it without showing anyone even Chun.</p><p>Researchs, projects and communications are done at an incredible speed, we got 6 researchs, 7 project, completed xyloph and neron update at the end of day 3, the ship is already the best I ever had on English mush, the 16 members of the crew are all still very active and talkative, people in dorm are sharing the scooter... We are slowly starting to discuss if we should put the priority on long run survival or eden search, we want both of course but as the only pilot, im afraid it’s going to be very hard to handle the hunters and explorations. I talk to researchers to have them discretly make the natamy while they also do serum.</p><p><strong>Day 4</strong><br>Today the research team finished the natamy rifle and the serum, we had planned to use the serum on Janice and the rifle on Eleesha in case of failure (and to fire on other suspects after that) but Eleesha finally printed the list and gave it to Chun! Miracle.</p><p><strong>“At the very least one of them were an agent of Mush when we fled Xyloph. I'd bet my life on it... Finola , Hua , Chun , Chao and Stephen . But which one.. »</strong></p><p>At this point there was a lot more people in the “trusted channel” I should have written names down because I forgot as you all became trusted for so long since then <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. We got lucky on this, Finola was on the investigation team for long, Chao and I(hua) got Roland killed so it left us with only one possibility, we used the serum on Stephen and tadaa! No alive mush and 15 active crew members. Later on, Stephen gave out some info about what he had planned and been doing, he had hidden a weapon plan and was maybe going to kill Raluca or me.. but was probably hard since I was always with Ian and killing Raluca wasn’t the best move with two other technicians on board, he didn’t extract much spores as he didn’t had waterproof and saw what happened to Roland, by the time he unlocked the skill, all anti-mush researchs were up, making it very difficult to infect for a lone mush, he also told us there was no anonymush so the paranoia is slowly disappearing and a new part of the trip starts.</p><p><strong>Day 5</strong><br>A big wave of 20 hunters forced us to finally leave the orbit of the planet we’ve been slacking at to finish the relevant projets, the trail upgrade is finished, plasma shield is finished too, Janice forgot to stay in dorm with Raluca again, but this time we don’t plot anything against her.</p>

                <p><strong>Day 6</strong> Chun who got the Astro mage book, switched her medlab bed for the sofa with Paola who is done with coms and now works in the lab. So we now have 3 planet scanners, Frieda, Gieole and Chun. We found us a planet with O2 and Crystalite but sysmic activity too, after a lot of discussion, we move to the planet, pushed a bit by a wave of hunters. The exploration gives us no map fragment but we all come back alive, moving out again from orbit because of another wave of 20 hunters ,that seemed like a lot for d5 and im afraid of whats coming next, probably linked to the high ammount of actives at this point.</p><p>Eleesha is still running around ship I think, but we don’t pay much attention, Janice made herself suspicious again somehow but Stephen has no good reason to lie about the anonymush so we just let things go..</p><p>Terrence was able to pick pilot and robotics, we now got good drones and I have backup, future of the ship looks brights.</p><p><strong>Day 7 to 12</strong><br>We explore daily but no luck finding any star map piece, we also don’t have luck because our scanners, (frieda started idling a lot unfortunately), only found one crystallite and it was a mush trap of course, we settle for intelligent life, ruins, shipwrecks.. gathering artifacts but no map fragments, not having a diplomat or the white flag has really played against us too at this point, because we have visited probably more than 10 intelligent life and all I got from them was syphilis. We meet our first asteroids and d1000 but keeping things in order still seem very easy.</p><p><strong>Day 13</strong><br>Jinsu is dead on exploration of a planet that seemed very safe from an unfortunate chain of events : 2 of the 3 accidents possible on the planet happened to him and low damages from desert and mountain finished him <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> , also we were only ¾ as we had problems finding a 4th and got impatient so we just launched, was my big mistake on this ship and I apologies to Jinsu, on this expedition, we visited our 2nd cristalite, mush trap again, was the sad day of the trip.</p><p>After Jinsu death, no more speeches and panic attack started to occure more often, that's when we realized how Janice was hard to catch and to deal with, often spending the whole night in storages or weird places, im paranoid about dieing so was chasing her all the time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> in the end she did a good job as none died from panic attacks but the inactive Frieda who didn't bother leaving bridge to die as i had asked her to, still i missed you and your speeches badly.</p><p><strong>Day 14 to 21</strong><br>Chao is they new commander of the ship and he perform just as well as Jinsu in his role.<br>At this point we had lost almost all the weapons, a rope, few spacesuits in fires or in explorations so exploring was more risky but we always had 4 person, took some time to gather but all went pretty well but Kuanti who got lost once but we found him back. Im very glad none else died or got lost as we did a lot of exploration.</p><p>We had a routine going, scanning, exploring, sleeping with the ship in orbit and repeating the process the next day, we got a lot of artifacts (4 invertebrate shells that eventually led to even more fires later on)</p><p>We finally found our first star map piece from alien intelligence. But unfortunately there will be no more.</p><p>Everyone is participating but Frieda who had turned almost completely inactive and died from panic attack, (the crew kept her alive very long but she never reported her morale..) As time went by it became more and more difficult to keep exploring and surviving at the same time and we finally decided to go home after a lot of metal sheets on the head, countless fires and broken equipment all the time.. that O2 tank again noo!</p><p>No Eden but im still very happy of the journey, thank you all for your hard work, im stopping there to let the other persons give their point of view too, maybe ill post a little something for each of you but first im letting the others talk too.</p><p>ps: english isnt my main language sorry for the grammar/errors</p>

                <p>Terrence reporting in.</p><p>I'd just like to highlight that I got gold due to a very generous Paola, who gave me two of the MTPass codes she bought. And also that that gold made a very big difference for the ship, I think. Those drones became very important later on (whole bays of patrol ships breaking at once...), and Hua and I were able to swap off on shooting Araks and Trak, keeping us able to move as needed. And I had enough XP banked that I was able to unlock Shooter for Terrence around day 10, which goes a long way towards efficient piloting.</p><p>Another thing which made a big difference, from my perspective, was that we started the ship with a Sprinter mage book, which was very generously agreed upon to go to me. This allowed me to move better than the average person on the ship, as I got normal AP to MP conversion but still got my free movement out of rooms with people on them. For an example of where this helped, when the gravity sim broke on the last day, I was able to go from alpha dorm to the rear corridor to fetch the wrench and then move it all the way up to the lab, costing me only the 3 MP I had.</p><p>Jin Su's death hit me really hard; I was nearly ready to throw in the towel and start pushing for a return to Sol at that point. I also spent most of the latter half of the ship terrified of dying myself, as this was going to be the first time I actually made it back to Sol, and I really didn't want to die instead. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This ship lasted almost three times as long as my previous longest ship, and while it was great fun, I have to say I'm also somewhat relieved that it is done--it takes a lot of time and energy to keep body, soul, and ship together once you pass day 10.<br><br>And to whoever was Roland, I'm sorry. I wish we could have kept you along for the ride and cured you, too.</p>

                <p>Hey shipmates, I was Raluca.</p><p>I showed up in MMM by random chance, just started a game at the right time I guess. My first couple days were tough. This was my first time playing Raluca, so I didn't quite have a handle on what I was supposed to do and no one wanted PILGRED to advance too far until the MUSH were killed. So I spent a lot of time hanging out in the engine room watching the chat go crazy and helping out with odd jobs. I can't really tell you much of anything about the first days, I didn't see much. I was a little intimidated at first by how expereinced everyone seemed and felt a bit ignored for awhile, but I think partially I was just used to the frenetic pace of my previous games, where a crew struggle to finish PILGRED as fast as possible to end the game while randomly killing each other in paranoia before the ship eventually was destroyed by hunters. Also, I should have enjoyed the leisurely pace while I could have.</p><p>I also didn't realize how hard it is to play Raluca since she hardly ever gets to sleep in a bed. Especially once PILGRED was done and I was trying to repair as much as possible (and suffering a ton of panic attacks)</p><p>After a few days my NERON projects came up and then I felt like I had things to do and was part of the team. Kuan Ti was helpful to me in coordinating getting projects done and he helped me finish PILGRED.</p><p>Having been through this now I have a better idea of how to play Raluca and I'd totally do it again.</p><p>I've never had a ship last as long as this, it's interesting how the strategy is different. I've never played long enough to see skills become worthless (Once all the projects are done Physicist isn't that useful anymore) and I finally got to see what people were talking about when they said the game gets harder the longer you play. The organization you need to keep a ship going is hard when it bursts into flame every cycle. I do freelance work right now, so I'm home a lot, which was good and bad. The longer the game went on the more and more I felt I had to log in and see what was going on (especially as a tech) and to make sure I wouldn't die if I was away too long. When Terrence started talking about ending the game because it was taking up so much time in real life I sympathized. But like I said before, I had never paid attention to glory before (because I'd been so used to hoping to survive) and so the longer we went the more enamored I got with the idea of lasting as long as possible (and going to Eden, and really this is the first ship I was in that it was even a possibility to do that).</p><p>I'm really happy I got to play such an active ship, and we generally worked together pretty well, we finished a lot of research that I've never seen finished before on a ship (pretty much all of it), we even managed to cure a mush (which works out better for a ship if you can swing it because the longer you go the more active players you need, it's hard to imagine not having Stephen he was indispensable as the game progressed). Everyone helped out from time to time, even Frieda the few times she was active, so that was nice.</p><p>I would probably do an MMM again, an active ship is just so much better than one that's half full.</p><p>Thanks everyone, and especially Hua. You might have been a little over communicative, but your knowledge helped keep us alive. And thanks for starting this thread. It was nice to play with y'all. I hope we get to play together again.</p>

                <p>Janice here, I was just a bumbling mess in the beginning sickness and work lead to that and I'm not sure if Chao shared it with you but him and Ian..and..I think someone else all started our own little investigative squad with us primarily suspecting either Frieda or Eleesha before suddenly you all turned up and cured Stephen leaving me clueless.</p><p>As for storage room idling well I never did that the few places I idled were the Bridge, Medlab, and the occasional corridor because of broken doors. Seriously I think I had to turn around and reroute about 30 or 40 different times because I would go to get food or help with research(primary reason I would go off) and end up stuck because of a door having broken that cycle or cycle before and no one found it.</p><p>Anyway sorry I was such a massive loon in game I'm not used to being forced to shoulder the entire psychological burdens of an entire crew, which is even more stressing when you have multiple people messaging you every other day asking you to come help them.</p>

                <p>It was a hell of a ride, especially those sheet metal part towards the end xD<br>Or the time when I got lost on the expedition. (I was Kuan Ti as most of you already know)</p><p>At the beginning it was very slow for me. Going through projects, waiting for those crucial ones to show up and hoping that the remaining mush doesn't screw things over. A few times we had 2 good projects and obviously had conflicting opinions about which one to chose, but in the end I think we chose the best we could have. Thank you for all the relays I got Raluca, it was fun blazing through some of the projects. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we were finishing at least 2 projects a day...</p><p>My mush picks were, Eleesha and Frieda, as both of them were not responding and not doing their jobs as they should be. I sent multiple messages to Eleesha about the list, even contacted Chun(and chao, I think) about it. I also had a few PM exchanges with Hua (because of the sickness she got she was 100% human) and I guess I convinced the above mentioned people to invite me to the chat where the mush-hunters were. I finally got the "trusted" status!</p><p>As for Stephen the Santa Mush, he was suspicious, but not that much, because he was doing his job and helping everybody (and not spiking our food), but he didn't have much choice.</p><p>When we had the mush out of the equation, we started focusing on planets, looking for star map fragments. Even I went to scan a few times (remind me to not do that again, as Gioele sad, we are terrible at that, but I think it might have been the scanner, not us xD)</p><p>Since we had more than 8 mature plants, we didn't really need O2 planets so our choice broadend, but even so, those map fragments were no where to be found... (112 planets scanned) <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"><br>In 21 expeditions with multiple zones for an artifact we only got 1 map fragment. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br><em>(Yea we could have done more expos...but still, 21 and only ONE FRAGMENT?!?!<br>I want a word with the devs and the RNGod)</em></p><br><p>Anyways<br>For those that weren't able to see my end "speech" (with a few grammatical corrections xD)<br><cite>I'm ready to go home. It was a long and fun voyage, even though it was<br>scary and dangerous at times, especially that time I got lost in the forest <br>on a foreign planet, it was quite scary and depressing but, hey, you found me!<br><br>Something that has sticked with me is the fact that we had a Santa on this ship, <br>a waking, talking, cooking MUSH Santa! Thank God he got cured or we'd have <br>gotten different kid of present <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br><br>We also had our sad moments, when our commander, Jin Su died tragically on the expedition, <br>I hope you have found peace my dear friend Jin! <em>Drinks to that</em><br><br>Another thing I will remember is you guys running around the ship with extinguishers <br>in your hands going crazy to find those fires. Who needs the gym, who needs a treadmill <br>when you've got *FIRE* (<em>when I design the next ship, remind me to use more fireproof materials</em>)<br><br>The number of MP spent must have been over 9000 <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Thank you for your participation and your company, I hope you have fruitful lives! <br>We didn't get to Eden, but we are finally going home!</cite></p>

                <p>Yeah, I really don't think the game was designed to handle that much chatter. Removing as many no-longer-needed favorites helped with the lag a bit, but for most of the last week, it was taking me about 10-15 seconds per action (pick up something, post to chat, change rooms, etc.). And then the final day (day 20) the lag increased even more (I have to wonder if we passed some "number of messages" threshold that broke the code <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">), so it was taking me closer to 30 seconds to do anything.</p>
