                <p>So here's what happened from Frieda's POV:</p><p>The mood of the ship was tense right off the bad, thanks to Eleesha. The moment she woke up, she began rambling off nonsense and generally being a pain. Raluca harmlessly announced she was holding the cat to keep it safe from the Mush, and our Tracker went ballistic. She began threatening to kill Raluca is she didn't drop the cat in the dorm....this before the Mush had even been assigned.</p><p>I reported her as a griefer right there; her behavior just felt way too aggressive to be considered reasonable. It turns out that Eleesha was trying to "roleplay" her Vertigo illness by acting like a complete psychopath. And she promised to be on her best behavior after Janice cured her of the Vertigo. Besides Eleesha, the ship was very promising. We had a Gold Kuan-ti with Astrophysicist, as well as Gold Jin Su, Eleesha and Paola; Ian, meanwhile was Silver, and Finola was a Medic. Chun, Jin Su, and Stephen even hit up the Vending Machine to get us Noise Reducer, ACTOPI, and SNC. We had 15/16 people active at the start, with Gioele being the only non-responsive player.</p><p>But our problems with Eleesha by no means ended when she was cured of Vertigo. She got chewed out by practically every single woman on the ship at some point; I don't know why, but for some reason the players who complained about her almost perfectly split along the gender line. One day, Eleesha asked Chao why he had moved somewhere, and Raluca took the moment to say that Eleesha's playing style was ruining the game; Finola and Janice quickly told Raluca to pay no attention to her. The biggest fight was easily between Eleesha and Janice. Janice got unlucky and randomly hurt herself moving around the ship, so she asked Eleesha to heal her... since she was a Medic; she refused and then both of them began accusing the other of sucking at the game. Of course, this was the first time the rest of us had heard that Eleesha had elected herself to read the Medic book....me and Paola were not happy in the slightest and we let them know it.</p><p>It was at this point, with tensions at an all time high, that I picked up a blaster that someone had left lying in the dorm. I was simply concerned that the blaster would be a dangerous weapon to leave in the open, given that people were fighting and yelling daily.</p><p>cont...</p>

                <p>Two days later, I wake up drowning in a pool of my own blood. I'm starving and I have two critical injuries, for a total loss of 4 HP each cycle; I have 3 HP left.<br>I scan the messages and can't see anything about what had happened, so I assume the worst: The Mush are attacking. The room logs reveal that Chao had shot me repeatedly, and then I notice on the top of the screen that someone is dead. I check the ship logs again, and I can't say I was surprised when I saw that Eleesha had been murdered. I shoot my assailant and crawl to Refectory for the medkit, shouting that Chao had tried to kill me. I heal myself, but Paola then informs me that I'd need surgery to fix my wounds. She kindly heals me again, and after I stuff down a ration I have enough AP to fix the Critical Hemorrhage, leaving me with a regular Hemorrhage. Yay.</p><p>Eventually I'm told what had happened. Unbeknownst to me, the research team<br>had finished the Natamy Rifle to night before. Ian, Chao and Eleesha had formed the Mush hunting team (which now makes me wonder if Eleesha really acted alone when she read the Medic book?) and I became one of their top suspects after I grabbed the blaster. IIRC, Paola tested Hua and Chao tested me with the rifle; they had Eleesha heal us afterwards. The problem is, I was only healed once and Chao apparently shot me 3 times...leaving me with an injury each time. Paola was very helpful here, pointing out that a Shooter shouldn't have been doing the test because of the risk for critical hits and she sympathized with the fact that I had just been one cycle away from death. One thing I didn't mention about Eleesha - the girl really liked to eat. Stephen had earlier complained about Chao and Eleesha eating rations, and after Ian mentioned that Eleesha was eating his bananas Stephen told her to stop. Eleesha responded to Stephen's warning by saying that because she ate twice it was proof she was human, fatally missing our chef's point. She went her 4th ration in 4 days right after healing me 1/3 of the way, so Stephen went for his knife. For some reason, Janice and Raluca didn't take the news very well and this is where they started to mistrust Stephen. At the day change, we lost our second player when Hua died of Starvation, no doubt accelerated by the Natamy test.</p><p>But besides the lackluster Mush hunt that had only resulted in a dead pilot and an old lady's blood all over one of the dorm beds, things were actually going great. Medic Finola and Biologist Ian made a killer research team; Jin Su and the quiet Roland kept all of the hunters at bay; Paola was the perfect comms officer: all the crucial rebel bases were getting completed, and she unlocked all of Xyloph in record time. I was busily but unsuccessfully searching the cosmos O2. Kuan was helping with that, while him, Stephen and Terrence were also giving us a steady flow of NERON projects. By now, Plasma Shield had come up as the next NERON project. We called up Raluca to work on it right away, and although Pilgred progess had been slow to that point, the shields became her main focus. To be efficient, she decided to idle in the Nexus, which Paola immediately warned her was a bad idea. Raluca and Paola got into a small argument, at the end of which Raluca insisted she was safe because she people would only enter the Nexus when she called for a reset. Knowing it was pointless, Paola let it go.</p><p>Less than a day later, Kuan-ti found oxygen for us at the same time Ian and Finola finished Mycoscan. After the loss of Hua, Stephen read our second Mage Book and we had our third pilot; he took a ship out to fight off some Aracks, but then stayed out to collect scrap.<br>We all began to scan ourselves and report our findings in Ian's thread. Just when things seem to be settling down for a while, Raluca signs on...and alerts us to the fact that she has two spores. And this is where Stephen got screwed; somehow, possibly from some disease or from SNC, Stephen said he vomited earlier and got himself dirty. Janice had been in the room he said it happened though, searched the log, and had found absolutely no evidence to support his excuse. She had already voiced her misgivings BEFORE Raluca announced the spores. To make matters worse, Eleesha had printed the list the day she died...the names were Hua, Frieda (that's why were tested), Paola, Raluca, Roland, and of course Stephen.<br>Raluca confirms that it must have been Stephen, noting that he had come into the Nexus before she called for a reset. To his credit, Chao reminds us that Terrence and Kuan-ti had also been in the Nexus and could easily have been the real culprits. But we didn't listen to him; I contacted the 90% inactive Gioele after noticing he was online online and got him to load the fuel. Jin Su moved us, our pilot-chef was left behind, and revealed to be a human pilot-chef.</p><p>To keep things moving, Roland volunteers to lead the expedition, but O2 was the last thing on our minds. Raluca fell back on the "hide in a room and tell no one to come in" strategy,<br>that had been working so well up until then, and ran to Front storage. I began insisting<br>in the new Mush-hunting private thread that someone guard CC to keep her safe; but the next rebel base was the +6 morale one - guarding the room would shut Paola<br>off from the Bridge and we couldn't afford that. It was inevitable then, when I woke up the next day and there's three mush - two alive, one dead. <br>Terrence, the quiet newbie, had rushed into FS in the middle of the night and had converted Raluca; he was then killed by Paola. Finola and Ian had already began working on the cure.<br>In what I admit was not one of my smarter choices, I publicly announce that Roland must be the 2nd Alpha Mush. He was online, and (I don't have my tracker) Paola tells us he left the dorm more or less right after I made the announcement. I was still in the medlab bed, recovering from Chao's test, so I rush to the to the Refectory to grab the Natamy Rifle...the same weapon that had been used on me. But Roland makes it to the lab and swipes the Mush Sample (I'm not sure why he didn't go for the disk; Paola might have already been holding on though), leaves, and is out in a patrol ship before I even make it back to CC. He never stepped foot in the ship again.</p><p>It was pointless; Paola had already unlocked the Ghost Sample, and we still had the genome. Ian and Finola completed and administered the cure within a day or so; And if you're wondering, Roland (with pretty much all of our approval) did report Raluca.</p><p>Meanwhile, we remembered our oxygen situation and slowly gathered a crew...and I mean slowly. Janice removed the BIOS lock, and after Roland had been in space for almost a day, I launch the expediton with Pilot Jin Su, Paola, and Chao in tow. We got lucky with 24 units of O2; Jin Su then came back and we took off, finally killing Roland.</p><p>By this point, Chun, who hadn't moved since buying us the Noise Reducer, had died. Gioele randomly suicides via the cat after saying he doesn't want to play anymore - he dies Mush. Turns out Eleesha was wrong and the cat really was in danger! There were a few more smaller fights - without Eleesha, Janice and Raluca just started fighting with each other. Our golden boy Kuan-ti kept on finding planets - every planet we ended up visiting was his. I found ONE decent planet my entire time on the ship - it had O2 and crystallites; but we lost it when the captain moved the ship without checking the planet thread. KT turns around the same day and finds a planet with O2, crystallite, and 2 HCs. By Day 10, we completed PILGRED, had 32 units of O2, and plenty of hull strength. Even better, Raluce was a Tech the 2nd time around, so were able to build the sofa and the Babel module. The road to Day 13 was clear.</p><p>But we only made Day 11. After a promising expedition, Jin Su had to log off in a compromising position. At d11c6, he said he wouldn't make it back until d12c1. Two asteroid were going to hit in the intervening cycles. We had 56 hull though, and around 60 in the Plasma Shield, so Jin Su didn't by any means leave us to die. But Janice, Paola, and Chao had already wanted to go home the night before; me and Kuan wanted to stay. However, right before the expedition, a panic attack left me at 2 morale, with no way to bring it up before the day changed - Janice was needed elsewhere. - so I changed my tune. With none of us able to kill the Aracks so we could leave the planet, we agreed that we should return to Sol now, while we were all still alive. Janice grabbed the hacker kit and brought us all home. And abruptly, the voyage was over! It was a glorious trainwreck from start to finish, but I'd still love to see most of you again some time!</p>
