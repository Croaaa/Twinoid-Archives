And then Stephen went and did my daughter. Goddamn.<br><br>This is the story of the Daedalus, the ship that reached the utopian planet called "New Eden", and the sad shipowner that died the day prior to reaching it. From a set of expo events that had less than 1% risk of occurring in the sequence they did...</em></p><p>EDIT: <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3583">This is the ship.</a> <br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>The Mush phase</strong> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><br>So it all began with the PILGRED breaking down and the crew having to wake up. Grump Gioele and Stephen woke up, both having rainy clouds over their heads and making snarky remarks about it. They decide to start blaming it on Kuan-Ti, who they then find out is a vegetable. Another victim of the cryo-pods. Seems Jin Su is as well. Just to add to it, they find out that two of their crew members had been exposed to Mush and had awakened as agents of the terrifying fungus.</p><p>First day passes by, everything seems calm. Gioele has his coffee and discusses coffee blends with Chao and Finola, while in reality, he's rigged cameras around the ship and is scheming with the crew he relatively trusts (Gioele trusts no-one), planning who to kill. Kuan-Ti dies that day because of that he never finished the tutorial. Jin Su is drooling in Alpha Bay.</p><p>Then, Eleesha is killed. Apparently she went amok and punched Chao to near death. She's killed by Hua who's secretly held on to the knife since the start of the game. Or, at least Chao wanted it to seem that way as he explained the whole occurrence while being healed by Finola. Gioele, however, knew the truth. Chao had shot her twice before torturing her, and blew her ears off. She couldn't communicate, and was killed looking like a lunatic. She'd been speaking to Gioele in a private chat before the attack though ,and was able to leave one last message before she was killed.</p><p>This seemed far too fishy, especially when Chao started asking Gioele to go get items for him that he himself had been around before. It screamed "<em><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">Trapper! Trapper!</em>".</p><p>A "facial redecoration" later, and Gioele found out that Chao sure was Mush. He then disposed of the vegetable Jin Su and assumed control of the ship.</p><p>We then started to look for the second Mush. Hua had been holding on to a secret knife and had helped Chao in killing Eleesha, so it seemed obvious that she was the other Mush.</p><p>Until Ian came with some interesting insight on the case. He told Gioele that Finola had been working awfully slow in the lab, and seemed to sleep most of the time. Even so, she wasn't inactive, she spoke quite a bit, as a matter of fact. She'd also been silently active while Chao was killed. Then Gioele realized... it had been <em>Finola and Chao</em> that were speaking to him about coffee, and Chao had been in there before he drank it. "Oh crap." Gioele thought. "I probably have a bunch of spores in me."</p><p>So we kept our eyes on her, and sure enough, Ian caught her red-handed as she trapped a shelf. We rushed the cure and injected her with it.</p><p>Oh, and yeah, 2 spores. Close call! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/fear.png" alt=":fear:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/planet.png" alt=":mush_planet_scanned_1:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>The other days</strong> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/planet.png" alt=":mush_planet_scanned_1:" class="tid_ico"><br>From now on writing in first person.<br>Then there were the six other days. The days of Gioele's reign. Constantly being a bossy asshole is rough, and it always felt like the crew weren't responsive enough. I think Gioele's mindset was actually leaving impressions on my real one. It's not like me to play, act and write as such a character (Roland is my favorite), and I was feeling weird towards the end.</p><p>We kept going after the Mush threat was neutralized, and went on several expos, storing up on fuel, oxygen, artifacts and food. Then we focused on going only to planets with cristallite.</p><p>Sadly all the cristallite planets we found was nasty. Not "volcanoes, mankarogs and seismic" bad, but we got lost and hurt so often to the cristallite planets we went to. The first one hurt us bad and had a mush trap, on the second we found a fragment, but both me and Terrence got lost. Thankfully, both of us were found alive.</p><p>Then, on the third, I was killed by taking fatigue damage, and then hit twice for max damage from "accident" events, and Paola got lost. She was found, along with a fragment, though.</p><p>The day after they found the last fragment and went home. Oh, and my enemy, the one and only Stephen Seagull assumed command and went and did the thing with my daughter. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>To summarize</strong> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"><br>A good ship! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br> I had fun and some good laughs.</p><p>I was actually sorta sad when I had to kill Chao, as he seemed to be a cool guy. Thankfully I could keep speaking to him over messages on Twinoid.</p><p>Also, a shout out to Janice, the one that helped me out so many times on the ship. You were a great teammate.</p><p>But all in all, it's been a good ship. I hope the rest of the crew will add their perspectives and details to the story. I hope no-one is mad at me for being such an ass for 10 days. Oh, and sorry for being so late with putting this up. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico"></p>

It was my first Eden victory, I must say it was a quick one. I always thought it needs around 15-20 days to get there. I'm proud of my garden, unfortunately we didn't last long enough to use it with 100% efficiency (some Bumpjunkins were still young when we got back). I'm not kinda sure why we did got back so soon? We were in good health and mental condition, ship was ok as well, good stock of oxygen and fuel. I know it's a risk, but I've been in worst situations and ship made it to day 20.</p><p>I really liked the way of Gioele and Stephen play, even though you seem to hate each other <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> You both made a good captain/leader. It was rather unfair that Gioele died in such circumstances, but well, that was the RNG choice, not ours. The ship was very well organized, it was the first time I've seen people having too mush APs and too little tasks <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I was afraid that on MMM ship it might be really hard to fight mush, but here it went quite smooth. Anyway, this is one of my best ships, I really hope to fly with you again.</p><p>PS. It was my first time with Ian having frugivore, I do not find it very useful, plants instead of coffee also increase morale and health, I guess it's considered selfish when Ian tries to control those, I've tried to make a best ise of my extra APs.</p>

                <p>Frieda here, nice ship, didnt feel that Gioele was too bossy, you took good decisions that were rarely questionable at all, someone had to push this crew a little and you did it perfectly, as soon as you died, things seemed to fall apart and we would have probably stayed longer if you survived. Only thing i would have done differently is stop the Neron update sooner and finish projects, especially since we had no Jumpkins and none to feed Paola, it was going awfuly slow <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> would have liked some of the lab crew to scan more too instead of doing glory researchs before Eden was found, but these are small details..</p><p>Some of you already covered why we went home, but i have to add we didnt have the plasma shield yet and it seemed to advance very slowly, leaving very little room for mistakes at d10+ with already low hull at around 60, no hacker kit and a Commander who had to go for long periods.</p><p>Really enjoyed the rp especially Gioele/Paola/Stephen, Chao was a good mush too.</p><p>Thanks all!</p>
