                <p>Hi all,</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/finola.png" alt=":mush_finola_50:" class="tid_ico"> Finola here from the other MS casting ship: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6585" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6585</a></p><p>Well! It was a fun ride.</p><p>Chun and I were active very early, getting up anti-mush researches before the end of the first day. This allowed me to earn her trust so that I managed to survive until the very end without undergoing the dreaded Natamy Rifle test, while some other crew members had to do it more than once (I voted against retesting you Eleesha!).</p><p>Working with Chun I had to perform numerous operations on imbedded bullets, mashed feet, broken shoulders, hemorrhage, critical hemorrhage. I got so good at it Raluca didn't even notice when I performed surgery on her in Nexus <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Our Mush played very stealthy. We caught Hua fairly quickly, but Chao and Roland were definitely flying under the radar. For a long time Chao was a trusted mush hunter, he was only given away when he used the chaos of a cristillite zone to pick up an extra spore. Roland was the very last person in the crew that we suspected of Mush and then he (apparently) tried to fool us with the Natamy Rifle test by consuming a spore to seems like he'd taken less damage from the shot! Unfortunately for him, this result was so confounding that Chun knifed him to death anyway and found our last Mush.</p><p>Another interesting moment was when we used Natamy Rifle on Gioele and got a false positive result. We wasted the Retro-Fungal Serum on him based on that.</p><p>All in all, I don't trust the Natamy Rifle test and would discourage it in favour of expeditions and spoiled food to give people diseases <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Day 10 we eliminated all the Mush. Spirits were high, we were going to make it to eden, but first we decided to stock up on food, fruits and Oxygen... so we went to Bratema: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/11651" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/11651</a></p><p>On that accursed expedition we lost both our main sources of morale and it affected the crew so deeply we decided to call it quits and go home. We might have been able to struggle onwards, could possibly have got lucky with some cristillite zones. We had 11 active players still, two dedicated astrophysicists and no projects or research that demanded attention, but it was just such a god-damned kick in the nuts! So we made it back to Sol with no Mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> (but not without last minute Natamy Rifle testing of Eleesha under suspicion of being a traitorous Mush).</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> to all the crew, even the Mush who make this game what it is. A great introduction to castings, I've readied myself for the next one!</p><p>P.S. I am a fan of 2hr cycles, the pressure and revolving day changes!</p>

                <p>Natamy rifle was used to determine most of the human crew was human. However sometimes this was just because the resulting surgery went wrong and humans got Sepsis (disease clears human).</p><p>Natamy rifle had a false positive agains Gioele. No idea how that is possible, presumably has something to do with the effects of injuries. We used the cure on him to no effect (obviously) which cleared him.</p><p>Against Roland, we shot him and then were unable to heal him, presumably because he was online and used phagocyte to regain health. If we'd only been able to heal him once he would have been cleared as 'human'. Because we couldn't heal him (and he was the last person we were testing having cleared everyone else) we killed him, which revealed him as Mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It is what we used to clear everyone, and it worked to a degree (no one died but Mush until that terrible expedition), but very AP intensive due to all the healing and surgery required to prevent people simply dying from injuries after the shot. And it leaves so many doubts, as injuries lower health too, sometimes it generates false positives, it can be manipulated by cunning Mush to 'prove' themselves human... I don't like it, but it's better than doing nothing I guess.</p>

                <p>Stephen here on my 2nd casting ship.<br>And it was my first time Stephen - so i feeled somewhat uncomfortable.<br>With my automatically chosen skills (silver at that time), i tried to find my role.<br>But research was pushed really hard by Chun and Finola, Paola upgraded Neron via Comm - so i kept on carrying things around, where needed.</p><p>Second day was... strange. I parked in a dorm and went RL to bed. I woke up and - was bleeding nearly to death and had a broken shoulder. A horde of Chun, Chao and Finola have had Natamy tested me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I crawled to Medlab (At that time: The girls room!) to get a surgery by Finola aaaaand... got a sepsis. So from losing 2 health/cycle i got to losing 4 health/cycle. Okay, Chun healed the sepsis, so no biggie. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Day 3: Hua hijacked the Pasiphae (at least we thought) - so we pushed magnetic net and dragged her on board to kill her (and so we got our first Mush).</p><p>Day 4: We got a good planet! An expediton is planned. But at that second Jin decides to go to bed. Next day we go down (with him) and think of landing second time on that planet. But Jin sprints to bridge. Since he steered the ship in the wrong direction on day 2 we planned a new Natamy Test...</p><p>Whereas we had Mycoalarms and Pheromodem, the Mushes didn't have a good chance to spike us - and so we didn't know, how to uncover them. Everyone did their job... No suspect things happened. Jin piloted the ship Frieda finally found some good planets, Roland proceeded shooting Hunters, and so on... So the Natamy testing remained as our best shot(!) and Chao was highly involved.</p><p>Highlights:<br>- We wasted our serum on a human...<br>- Ralucas test (performed by Finola and Chun) was so fast, she didn't even notice, she was shot and got an ambulant surgery!<br>- Roland was Natamy tested and for a second after he couldn't be healed anymore we were at a point of "No one is a Mush?!"</p><p>After we got rid of the Mushes, the oddest thing happend: Our expedition to get steaks and fruits went as black as pitch. Janice AND Jin got so much damage, both died...<br>And with them, we lost our morale. Chars and players. After one short day of half-hearted continue, we decided to go back to Sol.</p><p>Conclusion: Really good ride with fun moments and a big climax! And even if i don't like Natamy tests, i really don't know, how we ever should have found out, who our Mushes were. And i don't like playing those general supporting chars... Lvl 2-Stephen sucks...</p>

                <p>Raluca speaking. Yeah. The surgery was a bit interesting, since apparently she didn't realise getting shot and surgery afterwards. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Apparently Chun used an underhanded tactic to distract Raluca from noticing her shot and Finola's surgery <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Too bad Jin Su and Janice died.

Planet scanning sometimes you get lucky, and sometimes you just get 8 out of 10 dangerous planets (one ship, those 8 had either mankarog, seismic and/or volcano). Searching for that perfect planet takes a lot of action points. With others on the case too, I was glad to get out into space occasionally and blow some hunters to smithereens.</p><p>Natamy testing is brutal, but at least there was a medic aboard. I don't think it is anything to be embraced again (especially if no medic aboard)</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/11651" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/11651</a> - 8 out of 9 zones resulted in fatigue or accident.

                <p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"> Chun here<br>There were so many things happened, I could not remember and write all - I will just write some of the events that I remember <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><strong>Finola</strong> and I started the ship at the same time, meaning: I worked together with her immediately since the beginning of the ship to rush all early defensive researches. I brought rations to her (which I also ate) and ate every time we could eat on the first day. I made sure there was no time for her to shower and she had the same exact AP count with me (no chance for phagocyte). So I confirmed her as human and trusted her from the beginning to the end. I trusted her on everything, even the Retro Fungal Serum. I let her use the serum on Gioele which of course not logged at all in the room log. She was doubted by some of the proven humans of course, but I never decided to test her at all.</p><p><strong>Ian</strong> and <em>mush</em> <strong>Chao</strong> were the first two people who coordinated some movements with me. I think without them I could have never started anything. I am usually a passive human player who does not do any in depth investigation.<br>Ian hid the first alarm to the refectory, which I regret a bit. I should be the one doing the hiding, but I think I trusted people too easy. I even trusted Chao (who was MUSH!) the blaster and the NATAMY itself. I think I even told him the knife's position. Though, Chao didn't do anything major - he was very cooperative except on the last day of his life. <br>Ian was the more enthusiastic one about the natamy test. Maybe he was not in his right mind; he appear well-mannered and gentle outside, but he just wanted to blast the natamy. He scolded me for trusting people too much when he was finally confirmed human from sickness (if I am not mistaken). He even doubted Finola and he nearly made me lost my trust to Finola towards the final days, but 'thanks' to him I got more paranoid as the time went on.</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> was ...not doing any detective works I think, but maybe I was the one to blame. I did not trust her so I never asked her to do anything. Eleesha, Chao, and me had a private channel. I only saw Chao asked her for logs occassionally, it made me think like they were pretending to be doing investigative works. I doubted both of them around in the middle of our trip, but we were busy guessing other possibilities.</p><p><em>mush</em> <strong>Hua</strong> was our first mush kill and it was quite early. She said she needed time to regain AP to land. We waited for that, but she was outside more than two or three cycles; the main concern though - was not that. I remember at one point that she still had the time to say that she refused to land because there was a natamy testing thus she refused to land because she only had 6 HP left, what would made her HP drop to 6 on early days? We even had the <strong>Underfloor heating</strong>. She knew about the test because Janice spoke in the public channel asking about the natamy test at one of the dorm. Hua also confessed that she only had 6 HP left while refusing to land. I asked her to land regardless of the test because it would mean that she is hijacking the pasiphae if she refused to land. She did not respond. Unfortunately for Hua though, <strong>Magnetic Net</strong> appeared immediately after the current project was rushed quickly because we wanted to look for the net. Praise the RNGsus. The net reached 90%+ really fast, we waited for Jinsu to came online before finishing it in order to prevent Hua from doing any harm before dying but somehow Kuan Ti finished it. Didn't matter because Jinsu came online soon after, and moved the ship to pull Hua back to Daedalus; and as expected - one shot from the Natamy killed her immediately. I got 9 glory points from this kill.</p><p><strong>Stephen</strong> was the first person to be tested. He was just an unlucky bystander in a defaced room and his face seemed suspicious every time I looked him in the eyes. Maybe he was just thinking about something irrelevant to our mush hunt. We were not really used the test yet at that time, we left him in the dorm after the test. Fortunately, he woke up very soon after the test and complained about the injuries he suffered - so we asked him to crawl his way to medlab to get surgeries from Finola.<br>On a side note: Personally I think the test on Stephen was the most dangerous, if I remember correctly: Chao was the one who did the shooting.</p><p><em>not necessarily in the right order (because almost everyone was tested, I am having a hard time remembering the order) : </em></p><br><p><strong>Frieda</strong> was tested because she was super unlucky with the planet scanning. Plus: she was counted among the people of the defaced room incident (people involved: Hua, Stephen, Frieda, Terrence). Though, she was the first one who reported about the incident to me.</p><p><strong>Terrence</strong> was also tested, he was involved in the defaced room. He reported in a private channel with me after some time has passed from Frieda's report, he admitted via a private channel that he had 2 spores on him after using the mycoscanner. We were a bit worried that he might have been converted and was just lying about the spore number. Finola and I were already used to the test, surgeries were done immediately after the test was passed (all of the next people to be tested were also healed from injuries immediately by Finola - our best surgeon on board).</p>

                <p>continued...<br>---pheromodem done<br><br><br><strong>Jinsu</strong>, following a missed planet. We highly suspected our dear captain, not to mention he was also quite inactive and not really decisive as a commander. I started to think he was acting like that just to slow our performance. He was eventually tested even though his name appeared negative from Paola's xyloph list. After he passed the test, we did not even invite him to the 100% human channel. FYI: we had 2 mush hunt channels: one was for the "supposedly human", the other one was for the 100% human including Finola. I am sorry for doubting you too much captain, it appears you're just a kind man who always hear what his crew had to say. I realized that you're always there to move the ship and worked hard to meet the crew's needs; our morale were greatly damaged after we lost both you and Janice from the "deathtrap" expo.<br><br><strong>Janice</strong> was tested, I think I was there in a room with her and the humans talked about the remaining suspects. We didn't really have anything strong against Janice but we were having a hard time figuring out what was the mushes' plans. I had a bad feeling about Janice which at that time I could not explain, but we went for the test anyway. Fotunately, no accident happened and she passed the test. <br><br>Both Jinsu and Janice lived until all mushes were killed. They both experienced the mush free ship with the rest of the crew for a bit.<br><br><strong>Gioele</strong> was tested, easily because he neglected his coffees (he had coffee junkies). He also had some suspicious movements, we spotted him drank a coffee with the apron in the lab - but then just stand idle without doing anything for the next couple of cycles. We tested him, the result was very intriguing; he was not fully healed with one heal attempt after the natamy shot. We decided thathe was a mush. By this time, Raluca has completed the Retro Fungal Serum. I let Finola administer the serum to Gioele, but she said she did not get any glory. <br>That could mean two things: <br>1. The test was flawed. <br>2. Finola was doing her own agenda, maybe stabbed the serum to someone else randomly.<br><br>As much as I trusted Finola, this kind of situation is really awkward. Though again, I went back to my first confirmation. I trust Finola and so Gioele must be human now whether he was previously a mush or not.<br><br><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> was the on the lucky side. He was one of the people we suspected because there was one occassion where he went in to the shower dorm without doing anything, then left. However, we never tested him; but someone healed him randomly and it appeared that he had a <em>slight nausea</em> - immediately invited him to the 100% human channel.<br><br>Before the confirmation of Kuan Ti though, there was an expo involving 5 members. Cristalite zone produced a spore trap result. The result revealed that one of the member was not infected, but <em>recovered</em> a spore instead. Chao was there. I don't remember clearly what happened, because I was sleeping at that time. Ian said that he couldn't understand the fact that I was still alive after trusting all weapons to Chao (except the Natamy). Chao did threw a grenade in the dorm where I slept in temporarily and attacked me a few times. Thanks to the crew, I woke up fully healed and still alive with <em>mush</em> Chao dead. Chao was the second mush to be killed. Ian was confirmed human at this point from sickness. This was where he scolded me for trusting Chao too much, he reminded me a few times before all of these happened. <br><br><strong>Paola</strong> was a great comm officer. In fact: she did everything right. There was nothing we could put against her. She was really human. We tested her, because... Roland (who had not been tested yet) was doing his job well fending off the hunters, he also ate normally. Raluca (who also had not been tested) was standing in the Nexus with a camera THE WHOLE TIME without getting dirty at all, she didn't even touch the pilgred before all the mushes were killed. Up to this point, Paola had finished all of her jobs via the comms terminal. Compared to Roland and Raluca, losing Paola might be more tolerable - although cruel... that was what we thought, because maybe that was the nature of the human. <br>We tested her, and of course she passed. No accident, surgeries done. We were left with Roland and Raluca.<br><br><strong>Raluca</strong>, with only her and Roland left as the final suspect. We decided to test Raluca because if we compare both of them: Roland seemed to be more hardworking (just because Raluca did not have anything else to do). We also need Roland to fight the hunters in the coming days. Plus: Raluca here is my RL friend. Every time I talked with the person, he kept on admitting that Raluca was a Mush. So, I really decided to shoot Raluca while I could. I didn't want any regret. It's better to kill a human rather than getting laughed at by him at the end game if Raluca were really a mush. The problem was: Raluca and I had the exact same online time. So I asked another friend of mine to keep him occupied, I asked this other friend to keep on chatting with him so he won't realize what was happening. Finola and I then rushed to the nexus and conducted the test. <br>Of course, Raluca passed the test - we carried on with the usual procedure and invited Raluca to the 100% human channel; which she then got confused and asked why she was trusted. On what basis? <br>Maybe Finola and I had truly mastered the art of Natamy that even after all those shooting and surgeries, Raluca didn't feel anything at all. <br><br><em>mush</em> <strong>Roland</strong> was the last one to be tested. I decided not to shoot him to death and wanted to conduct the same test like the what we did to the others just to be sure that the test could really be trusted. The funny thing was: Roland could not be healed after I shot him. That was a big question, I dropped and picked up the medkit to make sure I was not doing it wrong. The shooting percentage did not increase, it could only mean that Roland might had been online at that time and healed himself with phagocyte (he is the only one who can explain about this). I killed him and I got glory point. He was the last mush and the last crew member to be tested.<br><br>After that, we asked Eleesha to attempt printing the list. She couldn't print the list.<br>We did one more very final test in the last minute to Eleesha before Gioele hit the sol button just to make sure she was legit because we were too worried that a <em>traitor</em> was involved in the deathtrap expo.<br><br><br>That's all from me, I didn't keep a journal so I can't possibly write all of Chun's experience out here. I am not going to conduct a natamy test anymore on my next ship. The pressure was just too much. (although I did it to almost every single crew anyway)</p>

                <p>This was a fun read! I especially liked reading about the mush testing with Natamy. That is not something I have been able to learn a lot about through my own play as yet.</p><p>I wanted to add a few comments, mostly because many players read this, and this thread discussed a great deal of mush testing. People learn stuff and tend to take the ideas into their future games.</p><p>This was a casting ship. Casting ships can make their own special rules - you can basically make your own unless you're trying to allow the breaking of terms of service. If mush tests are legal on your casting ship - all is well.</p><p>But please don't take ideas about ship-wide or 'many players' mush testing to the normal non-casting ships. Non-casting ships all have the same rules, and we're pretty darn strict about mush testing and human testing. People who do 'random' mush or human testing on others are likely to be sanctioned if reported. If you have enough evidence on someone that you could legally kill them because they're that likely to be mush - then you're safe to mush test them instead of kill if you prefer. On the non-casting ships, players have been sanctioned for random kills, and also have been sanctioned for random mush tests forced upon others.</p><p>I would hate to have to explain to someone in the mod inbox why they were sanctioned for doing what they read about in a casting's [AP] thread, I'd rather hijack your thread for a moment and try to explain here, thanks!</p>

It happens when you're playing with 3x mush + hidden mush modes. Given that and the fact that using it is not well documented within SDF rules, we're not going to take any corrective actions for this ship.

                <p>I believe that we were using Natamy testing responsibly. Especially as we ensured after the first test always to heal and operate on all injuries immediately after the test.</p><p>We only did not perform surgery immediately on the first person tested (Stephen) because I didn't realise Medic Finola could do surgery using the medikit (I thought it had to be done in Medlab) and we didn't realise that Natamy rifle would be quite so deadly in terms of number of injuries.</p><p>The people we tested earliest, we had evidence against. That they appeared to be human after the Natamy test then provided us with evidence against the remaining untested crew.</p><p>Furthermore, I'm not sure Natamy testing is reliable enough to clear people or prove Mush anyway. I was especially concerned by the false positive result. Much like checking people on early days for damage after showering, alone it cannot justify murder, but it does add critical evidence.</p><p>I'm also concerned about the ability for an active and cunning Mush to fool Natamy testing by using the Phagocyte ability. If Roland had only been able to be healed once, instead of not at all, he probably would have been considered cleared and all our tests thrown out. It would have turned into a human verse human bloodbath. I mean there were only a few crew who hadn't been cleared by other means at that time (mainly diseases) but it would have made the game a lot more dangerous.</p><p>Certainly interesting results from Natamy testing at any rate. If I play a Mush on a normal ship sometime I might push for Natamy testing other people, just because the injuries are so brutal and it could cripple and kill humans merely at the testing stage <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> especially if we have Andie instead of Finola.</p><p>Natamy rifle is a double edged sword. It is a great tool against humans if managed well by cunning Mush.</p>
