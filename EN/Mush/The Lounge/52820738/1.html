                <p>After party thread for this voyage. A decent random crew. A most excellent Mush hunt with one good gold player Mush. What made this voyage enjoyable was the many crew members who worked so well together. We had no bickering or any real tension of any kind. A decent and relatively active commander. Outstanding player of the game was Terry AKA Wheels who was on top of everything including the elimination of the third and final Mushroom. Credit to Hua for another Mush kill and myself for the first Mush kill. Gioele (Mushroom) executed a transfer into Roland which cost us a good player and pilot (sorry Roland). On plus side Terry got him shortly afterwards when he notice the new Roland didn't have sprinter like the original did! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Anyway I do hope other players will post here if they were among the actives. Inactive/out to lunch players were Derek, Freida, and Ian. You going to play this game please make a commitment to it or play the characters that don't have to be as active to do their jobs. <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9172" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9172</a></p>

                <p>I was Eleesha on this voyage. Early on in the voyage Hua and I hooked up in private chat to discuss suspects. Based on available data I was dead certain Ian was a Mush and started slowly taking him down with a blaster. Hua was dead certain of Andie and after I took out Ian, Hua then took out Andie. Both were Mush but by that time there were three Mush on the bar. Gioele had been complaining about my killing Ian and Hua already suspected either Gioele or Janice as being Mush number three. After a review of all available data Hua and I attacked Gioele together. Unfortunately we didn't finish him fast enough. Gioele ran to the dorms and successfully transferred into Roland. He then killed Roland to prevent him from revealing the switch. It was expertly done Gioele! Fortunately, Terry noticed a little while later that the original Roland who had sprinter no longer was a sprinter. This little oversight cost you your life and Terry took down the last Mush hiding in Roland's body. I hope the Mushrooms will respond later on in this thread and clarify what their game plan was going to be. I had one spore on me by the way and want to know if I was spiked or had it at game start.</p>

                <p><em>Casualty List</em> *In order of death* Raluca (human) fatal depression, Ian (Mush) KIA by Eleesha (me), Andie (Mush) KIA by Hua, Gioele (mush/human) KIA by Roland, Roland (human/mush) KIA by Terry (Wheels), Freida (Human - Inactive) traded for Pilgred to Alien Race, Derek (Human - Inactive) traded for Oxygen, and KT (Human - Minimally active) Death by starvation. Total of 8 Dead and 8 Survivors who returned to Sol. Crew skills available were 4 pilots, 2 Techs, One Shrink, One Leader, but no biologists or planet scanners. We returned to Sol when our shields were nearly gone with 19 Hunters overhead. Also the RNG after Day 10 was very cruel pounding us with oxygen tanks failures and fires and falling metal virtually every cycle. Still I loved everyone of the surviving crew and am sure that both Gioele and Roland would have been fun to play with had they lived longer. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
