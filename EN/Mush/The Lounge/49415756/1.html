                <p>Well, I can't really say I saw this one coming exactly. But what can I say? We took a risk and it didn't pay off...</p><p>It just took a really long time for the fuse to burn down.</p><p>Chun here, for this game: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8559" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8559</a></p><p>So. Story time.</p><p>Right, so. We lost one mush (Eleesha) to a NERON quarantine. Along with Andie (Multiteamsters: Unfortunate... I guess? Honestly didn't seem like a big loss.) And shortly after that I saw Ian sabotage the surgery pod. So Stephen and I killed him. And that was two Mush down. Which we <em>assumed</em> meant we got our two alphas out of the way.</p><p>At this point, only half of the people on the ship were alive and active, so deciding to continue the bloodbath probably wouldn't have ended well for us anyway. Whatever the case, we decided to continue the ship as though there were no mush remaining. Stephen got lucky with some trades, Hua took a risk with exploration, and on day 4 we had PILGRED, 8 Hydropots, and two jumpkins. Even with only half of a crew, our chances of Eden seemed pretty good.</p><p>Except... someone seemed to be uncooperative... At this point, we had Quantum Sensors and Oxygenated Ducts as possible NERON upgrades. Everyone who had voiced their opinion on the matter had agreed that Sensors were our best shot at doing some good on this ship. Except for two: Janice and Terrence. Janice didn't seem to be much for conversation in the first place, so her work on O2 Ducts really just seemed to indicate that she wasn't even paying attention to the chat. Terrence, however, was posting to indicate that he thought sensors were a bad idea. (SPOILER: We didn't end up needing the ducts. I guess?)</p><p>At this point, I figured either Terrence was gonna cooperate, or we may as well just turn the ship around and head back right away. So in the interest of not wasting too much time figuring out which would be the case, I decided to have some fun in a way I've always wanted to on a ship.</p><p><cite> CHUN: You'll follow me, stephen, and the other 3 people who asked for QS. If you don't, you're standing in the way of us and Eden. If you decide to do that, then you're no longer a crewmember, you're an obstacle needing to be removed. I still have the knife, Terrence. I'm not afraid to use it if other crewmembers agree that you're no longer an asset. I don't like resorting to threatening non-mush crew, but it's well within the scope of the rules for me to do so if I have good enough reason to eliminate you. Another couple crewmembers agreeing that you're a threat is all I need. Take another count of the people who REALLY want QS and REALLY want to make the best effort we can to get to Eden and ask yourself: does it look like I can get a couple other people willing to kill to get to Eden? Because I think I can. And I think you should act accordingly. Think it over VERY carefully before you respond again. Everyone is watching. </cite></p><p>Yep. I know. This was probably a bad idea. I knew there was an OKAY chance that it would cause Terrence to reconsider, but there was admittedly a better chance it'd just cause him to act out. Honestly, I just felt like if he actually had any plan to make it to Eden he wouldn't risk doing something stupid. And if he WAS going to do something stupid, I would have rather he just did it right off the bat rather than wait a few days. Was it fair of me to make this decision for everyone? Nope. This was totally selfish.</p><p>But... I had too much fun with this to feel all that bad. Sorry everyone. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><cite>Terrence: I react very badly to threats.<br><br>Chun : This isn't a threat, Terrence. It's an accusation. Your fellow crewmembers are the jury, and I'm the executioner. This is justice. The federation will definitely see it that way too. (Chun leans back in a chair next to the refectory table, twirling the knife in her hand.) Hua risked her life to get us those jumpkins. I bled Ian dry to get us some peace to accomplish something great. And Stephen? He just traded away two crewmembers to slavers just because cryostasis didn't treat them all that well. Think their life is gonna be all that great now? Think stephen wants the burden that he just sent off two real people, geniuses in their own fields, to go through hell? Not if we don't get anything out of it. (Chun stabs the knife into the table, knocking a mug onto the floor to shatter in the process.) <em>You think we're gonna let some paraplegic wimp with a communication issue ruin everything we've lost our innocence to achieve?</em> You might want to listen to Kuan. He might be the only person on board with their humanity intact. </cite></p><p>Either way, it all worked out in the end. Seriously, my apologies to anyone who was worried that was going to turn out badly. I take as much responsibility for that as I take for assuming the mush were gone. (Good game, by the way, Roland)</p><p>But yeah. It did lead to some decent roleplaying. Here, have more highlights, no-one in particular.</p><p><cite>Chun : Ugh. You get to trade 2, possibly 4 people into slavery and I only get to stab 1. Where's the fairness in that, Stephen? I got a taste of danger and adrenaline and I want more! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"> ~19h<br>Hua : join the expos <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> ~18h<br>Chun : No, Stephens a stupid diplomat, so he'll convince the aliens to not want to fight us before I get a chance to stab them. It's kinda dumb. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> ~18h<br>Hua : you can always try visiting a mankarog in his natural habitat. or scale a volcano... doubt Stephen will help there... ~16h<br>Stephen : Stephen sputters Y-you think I enjoyed trading crewmates for survival? Look, I was a merc before, yeah, it's true, but we have ethics too. Your crew is your family. You keep them safe! I mean, I know I'm not the captain here, hell I'm not even supposed to be here but- I just- how could you talk about that as if it's a privilege? ~10h<br>Stephen : Well... I mean... I won't say I didn't enjoy driving the price up but- errr that's besides the point. ~10h<br>Chun : Haha, oh come on Stephen. Don't be so modest. You enjoyed every moment of it. There's nothing wrong with that... well... maybe objectively there is. sadist BUT I MEAN, COME ON! At LEAST we're better than these other guys on board. You know. The ones who wanna see Eden but clearly don't have the guts to do what has to be done. They're fully aware what the cost has been to get this far. And they want the end result too. It's not like their hands are clean either. They benefit from what we've done too. So what if we get a kick out of doing it? Why do you care if other people think that's wrong? They're no better than we are! Why deny yourself happiness for their sake? ~1h<br>Stephen : I think you misunderstand me, Chun. I take a .... certain satisfaction in doing what must be done. No more, no less. I mean... well, if I can profit from it without hurting anyone, more the better. Now, the feel of those blasters hot in my hands, taking down that mush who was a threat to us all... A feral cast enters his expression. Watching you with that knife... That's another story. <br><br>Where'd you learn moves like that, anyways? I doubt they taught that in nursing school, eh? ~1h<br>Chun : You'd be surprised what learning how to handle a scalpel can teach you, Stephen. Especially when you're like me and find that moment you break the skin so... cathartic. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"> Anyway, if you want to act like you're different, fine. I guess you probably have your reasons. But just like you watched me with that knife, I watched you pull that trigger. You can't hide what you felt at that moment from me. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> ~1h<br>Stephen : Nor am I trying. Think about it. It's like... [He casts about, searching for the right metaphor.]] It's like.... you can get a steak at a nice restaurant, and you can get a steak at a shitty restaurant. They're both steaks, but only one of them will taste good. It's like that. The timing and atmosphere and reasons, they all need to be right. I AM A GENTLEMAN OF SOPHISTICATED TASTES, OKAY? ~1h<br>Chun : Right. You're a gentleman. Based on your preferences for how to commit murder and human trafficking. No-one is denying that! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> 54min<br>Stephen : ... STOP MESSING WITH MY HEAD. Now I don't know whether I want to kiss you or leave you on this planet. Maybe both. 53min<br>Chun : Heheh, oh Stephen. You CLEARLY know how to show a girl a good time. 51min<br>Stephen : So, the rope it is, then. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> 50min<br>Chun : Alright. But you probably shouldn't gag me. If you do, I can't tell you which one of these coffees I spiked with hallucinogenics. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></cite></p><p>Sorry for the wall of text, but I really did enjoy this ship. Even if it didn't turn out at all like most of us thought it would.</p>
