                <p>The end: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7391" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/7391</a></p><p>So, it was that time again, jump time. I decided to be a Jin Su again with that last trickle of gold days I had left and prepared myself for a journey. The ship wasn't super active but that didn't worry me <em>at first</em>. An inactive Raluca died of fatal depression and a Roland was quarantined for something I wasn't really sure about. There were plenty of newbie 'Hello's and a Chun who claimed she was the Queen. Well, all those voices slowly trailed off into the night.</p><p>I collected the scraps and headed for Bravo Dorm for some shut-eye. (Premush) Mush selection happened during my sleep and I wake up to a mess. D2C8, Bravo Dorm had been defaced and Stephen had dismantled the shower. I picked up a blaster and open fired without entirely being sure what had happened. When that small blotch of pixels disappeared and I looked at the crew bar... +1 dead human...</p><p>There were only two other people in there: Janice and Frieda. I myself had gotten a migrane so I told the crew what had happened and healed myself of it in the medlab. Nobody even bothered to confirm it either. I was spent but before I left I opened a tab with <em>everyone</em> except Frieda and Janice and explained the situation. Moments later people were complaining of getting dirty for no reason and it was evident what had happened.<br>Massive Mushification.<br>From here on out activity levels basically nose-dived. Despite people being online and doing a thing or two nobody except Terrence replied to my pleas. So I shrugged, grabbed my blaster and headed for Frieda D3C4(?).<br><span class="tid_sideNote">Miss.<br>Miss.<br>Spectacular magic trick (Smashed arms)</span></p><p>I <em>dragged</em> myself to the medlab to patch myself up. I had a missclick and fell off the bed and had to use another <em><strong>3</strong></em> AP to get back on. I did some DIY surgery and;<br><span class="tid_sideNote">The injury of Jin Su (Broken nose) has been healed!</span></p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/oups.gif" alt=":anim_oups:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/calmos.gif" alt=":anim_calmos:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/angry.gif" alt=":anim_bad:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/tusors.gif" alt=":anim_out:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So I spent the rest of the day standing there crippled as I had Frieda visit me for no reason. I was literally screaming at that chat saying it was pretty obvious that she was Mush but nobody seemed to care.<br>Janice visited me in my sleep. (Not like that... Although..) She delivered that final spore and rid me of my worries. So I was basically sleeping next to two mushrooms, and little did I know they <em>needed</em> Stephen dead because when Stephen/Janice transferred they forgot to close a tab. I don't even know why they were using private messages to talk.<br>My gold days were about to run out so I grabbed Fertile, Mycelium Spirit, Infector, and phagocyte and readied myself for the next day.</p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">NERON</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><strong>Death registered : Gioele</strong>, cause : « Assassinated ».</span></span></p><p>'Apparently' there was some 'mush hunting' going on, as Eleesha owned up to taking the kill. From what I understood the only reason she killed him was because "he picked caffeine junkie over paranoid". Frieda and Janice were laughing away in their little channel while I just face-palmed. Did she not get the memo that there was 100% chance there was a Mushroom that needed eliminating?!?</p><p>On the plus side, my new team was winning. Amiright? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/surprise.gif" alt=":anim_surprised:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Daychange was approaching and Frieda and Janice had their eyes on the prize. For some strange reason Bravo Dorm had started collecting a few people. Ian, Chun, Eleesha, Kuan Ti, Janice and Frieda were all there. So we all readied up our spores and Frieda defaced. They both turned Ian straight up and Frieda took annonymush. We asked him to leave but he didn't seem to be around at that moment, so I put two spores into Eleesha and put a few bullets into Chun. (Two blaster, just sitting there in BD. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) Daychange and Ian left, I told Frieda to deface again but she said she didn't have the AP. So, I sent her a mission (she had the previous days mission too) and she finished off Eleesha and put one spore into Kuan Ti. I put a spore into him too and a few more bullets into Chun before I left our merry band of mushrooms to do stuff IRL.</p><p>I come back, Janice has finished off Kuan and mutated, slaughtering Chun in one hit. (Thank me later?) She also killed Hua. Terrence came online and is like:</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Terrence : JANICE IS MUSH ! She has mutated in alpha dorm and she killed hua.<br>Terrence : Come and kill her quickly</span></p><p>So, being the 'good' commander I am, I went to Alpha Dorm and had a look.... Janice was just standing there, all mutated and Terrence had done <em>nothing.</em> So, to pay for his crimes he received a gun-load and a half of bullets and a bit of a slap around too. Kuan Ti expressed his anger at the crew and at the mushrooms before mutating. Ian mutated too, and soon enough there were only Mushrooms left. I loaded one fuel and did a celebratory Daedalus spin and shoot and lay my head down for the end.</p><p>This <em>could've</em> ended differently I dare say, but those smashed arms crippled me for almost 24 hours, and I was easy pickings. GG to the mushrooms, you played well, humans, you could learn a thing or two here. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/angry.gif" alt=":anim_bad:" class="tid_ico"></p>
