                <p>Genuinely trying but struggling with balancing real life <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/paola.png" alt=":mush_paola_50:" class="tid_ico"> here.</p><p>When we first came on board I discovered Terrence was the love of my life. Not such an impossible idea since he's a smart guy who is into engineering and I've always had a thing for those. We spent the first Day or so talking mechanical construction long into the night but that was all that really happened between us.</p><p>I headed to the deck to do Comms where I made a frightening discovery: since waking up my mind kept drifting to Terrence and I hadn't thought of Kivanc (my until then love of my life) once! It was only as I tried to make radio contact that his existence even occurred to me!</p><p>This was a Deeply Distressing Discovery and I became reluctant to work on the Xyloph DBs, afraid of actually reaching him and not knowing what to say but from that moment on I stayed on the deck and away from Terrence (who pretty clearly wasn't that interested anyway... he was very interested in the talk but... not as much.... Other Things).</p><p>So I then spent long hours forcing my mind onto Kivanc. Unless I was purposefully concentrating he'd just sort of drift away and be replaced by Terrence but my drive to focus on this activity was only reinforced when Finola announced that she'd found a serum in our bodies and that the sequence in my body matched Terrence exactly. This plus Terrence announcing that it would be a terrible idea to act on this serum sealed for me my focus on Kivanc alone and we made contact.</p><p>Since we both had long-standing commitments to the concept of Free Love (but never any interest in anyone else until then to make it a practical consideration!) Kivanc and I re-confirmed that we are each free to love all we love as long as it is done with honesty and care and I became a much happier Paola who no longer had to force my mind on Kivanc. Terrence drifted to the back now, still there, but just like a low hum.</p><p>HOWEVER! Next I found myself almost irresistibly drawn to Kuan and Roland at the same time! Kuan, as a designer and IT expert I could easily understand: he was just another unique flavour in my Usual Type but Roland was something of a surprise! He was smart (takes smarts to have an effective sense of humour) and very clearly thoughtful and kind (also like Kuan and Kivanc!) but he was so... strangely... <strong>physical</strong>.</p><p>After some awkward interactions where I'd started thinking they both love me and then realizing that I was being big-headed and in point of fact they both clearly loved each other while I was foolishly inserting myself in their way (i.e. a tea party where Roland had asked to speak to Kuan but I invited myself in and an injury after an Incident where Kuan thought we'd skip the tea and Roland ran off to aid Kuan) I was finally brought around to realize that Roland at the very least was actually pretty interested!</p><p>But then... disaster! Just as we were about to consummate our love for the 1st time in the Medlab (as grossed out by the idea on some level given how... active my Dad and his love were in there!) I woke to find him playing with my hair and all my obvious feelings gone or covered! We both felt like we were in a fog and weren't sure what was going on! Since Roland and I felt it 1st and we were both in the Medlab we wondered if there could have been something wrong with it (could pills decompose and release noxious confusing gases..!?).</p><p>This was <strong>A Big Problem</strong> because my Dad and Finola were going to get married the very next cycle and expected my participation! With my feelings all spun about again I couldn't trust that their feelings also weren't manufactured and they were about to make a terrible mistake... even though Fin was already pregnant.</p><p>I'd always been a little suspicious of Finola even though that totally went against her file and everything I'd learned about her from Ian after spending regular time with him in the garden under the heatlamps each day. I was concerned that having found the serum she'd also found some way to manipulate it and make my Dad fall in love with him. I thought I'd learn that she was no longer the Finola she thought she was (and maybe even was a Mush imposter!) by challenging him to talk to her about Tau-Ceti... but to my surprise she did still care and even brought my Dad around a bit to offering me a humanitarian job around it when we got back!</p><p>This made me feel my theories were groundless until yet another feeling change happened. Except it didn't hit Finola or my Dad and if Finola was behind this just to marry my Dad there's no reason she would make me ill and confused right before the crucial moment of the wedding when she knew full well it wouldn't go ahead unless I participated. My Dad had made that clear enough!</p><p>So then wedding went on hold a bit while Finola checked me and Roland out and this time she found... nothing. There was absolutely nothing strange about my system and this gave me yet another crisis of confidence. Was she lying? Was I just subconsciously so upset about this wedding I was making problems for it? Only Roland and I seemed to be having any problems so with the problem seeming to be me I made on last ditch effort to be absolutely sure with my Dad that his and Fin's love was true and then the wedding went ahead with my leaning on Roland for support in my confusion.</p><p>I promptly went to bed right after and passed out for many, many hours and when I awoke things were clearer than they had been the whole journey: my head was perfectly clear and I felt exactly like my old self again, the Mush had revealed itself and so had The Big Plot. We now understood the terrible experiment we had been in under with, worse, some of us still irreparably under it (dun dun dun)!</p><br><p>But what about Kivanc, Terrence, Kuan and Roland in my clarity? Well, I still cared for them all (all you need is love?!) but Roland seemed to stand out a little bit. After relaying how Kivanc and I feel about sharing love to see if this would be acceptable to Roland (it was new to him but he was willing to give it a shot) we once again returned to the Medlab for something of a happy ending (at least for us!).</p>

Mr Rinaldo contacted me about suspicious circumstances surrounding his 'feelings' and I replied with a series of blood tests. I can't exactly explain what I've found, but will need more information before I continue. I will collect blood samples wherever possible. Keegan out.</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Research Logs Day 3 Supplimental</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Finola Keegan here. We've made considerable progress on our various research projects, but as the day goes on I feel as though I am being abandoned in the lab by myself. Ian is off dilly-dallying with Raluca, Chun is... Well she seems lost. You can imagine how much progress I'm making with fewer and fewer assistants... Keegan out.</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Research Logs Day 4</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Finola Keegan here. I decided I'd post my preliminary blood analysis to the crew to get their take on it... But as time goes on the arguing worsens. I delivered a simple preliminary analysis and the whole crew is up in arms about it. Proceeding with further analysis' may cause more problems.. Keegan... Out...</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Research Logs Day 5</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Keegan here. I haven't seen a soul in here all day. The noises from the medlab worsen, and they're getting worse.. Its hard to focus on my research with all the comotion.. I've completed my spectral analysis and to say the least its not good. Evidence suggests that the serums effects are only temporary, but somehow someone or something is continually infecting the crew. My prolonged aloneness (is that a word?) is evidence enough. My serum % has dropped sharply from 48% to 12%. As my feelings for Roland subside its clear I was unwillingly influenced. But observing the behaviours of my prior research assistant Ian, his seemed to skyrocket when he started having feelings for Janice.... I've been working on a prototype to detect and analyse, but so far its nothing more than a prototype.</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Research Logs Day 6</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Keegan here. I was right about Ian and Janice. They've been infected with a new polymer chain, making them infatuated with eachother. This, naturally developed into the moaning and screaming I so ever seem to dread. Things got complicated when Raluca woke up, she attacked Ian and when I attempted to stop her she shaved him clean! Tensions worsen. Gioele's finally decided to make a move at the very least, although Hua's mental state is definitely in question. Frieda's loosing it too. After all the work I put into her, she doesn't seem interested in Kuan Ti anymore. I require more data. Nevertheless, molecular analysis is underway. If my dreary eyes aren't lying to me, its quite evident that this mystery serum is a concoction of a large amount of chemicals. It's going to take a long time to figure this one out...

Believe it or not, all that moaning has created a child! (Well, I mean, not a born one yet) Janice is pregnant. This, of course, was no shock to Raluca, but she was angry nevertheless. In other news, I've acquired a few additional blood samples and have been testing them as I go. Serum %'s in everyone that I've tested seems to be readily declining, and my system appears to be almost clear of it. And now suddenly, at the end of the day I'm swamped with people in the lab under very suspicious circumstances. Furthermore, the room is slowly filling with post-it notes that are not mine. This concerns me slightly, but if people have been reading my research notes.... I think I'll keep the particulars of my research in my mind for now, the rest of the crew isn't ready. Keegan out.</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Research Logs Day 7</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">I've made considerable progress on the serum analysis thanks to the additional help I've been recieving. Although I won't note it down in these research logs, I will keep a copy on my iTrackie. Gioele and Hua appear to be 'on the rocks' so to speak. And one of those rocks was a starmap fragment! Gioele brought it to the lab for analysis. Apparently Roland got lost while I was asleep... They found him, but I'm sure he'll be emotionally scarred by the experience. He seems to have taken a liking to Paola (As well as Kuan Ti), so odds are I'll need to run a new series of tests.. Keegan out.</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Research Logs Day 7 Redacted</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">If the science is sound, which I'm fairly certain it is, either someone or something is increasing the amounts of the serum in some people, and even the polymer chains have changed. In a sense, I think the whole Ian/Janice fiasco was caused by this sudden change in chemical composition....<br>It seems like this mystery serum deteriorates at varying rates depending on the individual. I'm guessing it was designed to force an initial lust towards the two unwilling participants, and as it decayed the 'love' towards themselves was formed. Because the blood tests I'm performing are all so... Random, its hard to find a baseline on deterioration rates and mutations.</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Research Logs Day 8</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Keegan here. Things are getting.... Weird, between one of my research assistants and I. I won't divulge names due to certain matters that may and probably will develop over the next few days but nevertheless I have a duty to this ship to report it. I will be acquiring more blood samples incase he too has become a victim of an alternate polymer chain change. Further speculation continues as the crews mental state deteriorates rapidly. Stephen, our now psychologist chef seems undeterred by current events, but he assures me he is doing his best to keep it under control. Assuming a member of the crew is responsible they must be apprehended! Before I am forced to fall in love with them, nevertheless. Keegan out.</span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Research Logs Day 8 Redacted</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Further tests show alarmingly high levels of testosterone and estrogen in the serum, which would be responsible for the increased 'need' to pro-create. Spectral analysis is complete, readings show a semi-translucent substance with a slight red tinge, possibly brought about by red food coloring. Chemical analysis is well underway but preliminary reports, indicate a large variety of chemicals, hormones and enzymes..<br></span></span></p><p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Research Logs Day 9</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Super happy Keegan here. Well, things might've moved fast but myself and Gioele are engaged! Sounds so weird typing that... Both our bloodworks were tabulated yesterday with only trace amounts of the serum so it is definitely genuine! I think I'm going to put down my apron for a few days at least and let someone else work on research. I'm sure a few days of pure heaven won't get in the way! Soon to be Dr. Rinaldo, out. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></span></span></p><p>I didn't do anymore after that.<br>I'll post my point of view tomorrow.</p>

                <p>When I logged in to see I'd rolled Gioele, I was unhappy. I've played my share of Gio, he's not someone I particularly enjoy RP'ing usually, and I feel like I have to pull and use all the coffees, so more active than I wanted to be required to be.</p><p>I promptly decided that it would be amazing to play a cranky asshole on a love boat and did exactly that. Sure, he cared about the crew, but he went to great lengths to avoid admitting it. Things like claiming that he had Finola throw a grenade at him for 'Um.... foreplay?' instead of that he was getting rid of it to keep those violent lovesick maniacs safe from themselves. He did what he saw needed to be done, and for most of the ship, believed that the ends justify the means. He started to question that line of thinking towards the end, when things started to be revealed. His two favorite words were 'coffee' and 'bullshit,' because to him, if it wasn't coffee, it was bullshit. And this Gioele hadn't had any loves since his late wife, who died 15 years prior.</p><p>His reaction to waking up and being compelled to be near Hua was to promptly accuse her of drugging him with a love potion to get his money. That relationship continued just as awkwardly from there on out. X) So much fun. Gioele wanted more than Hua was giving, even while he was doing his best to shove her away, and it was terribly frustrating for him. But he found a friend in Finola, who for some inexplicable reason cared enough about him to try to get him to be a better person. And that grew into something more. I wish Stephen hadn't decided to help that along, it had a lot of nuance and both of them were also stubborn idiots so... X) But he did dose them with a serum that basically forced the love issue. And then Finola apparently decided that she HAD to have a baby cuz she was like, ninja sexin Gioele. I'd walk into the medlab to healcheck or return to my refectory sofa and next thing I knew the DTT message popped up. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/omg.png" alt=":omg:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Establishing an unlikely friendship with Kuan Ti after Gioele decided to dangle him from the Icarus planetside in a half baked attempt to keep Frieda from killing herself ( o.o' ) was a lot of fun. Especially since Kuan Ti was the bullshittiest of all by Gioele's initial estimation. Baiting and being baited by Raluca was brilliant, even if those things were really hard to type. I tend to be very non-confrontational and a lot more comfortable with cheery or passive characters, so with a lot of things I typed up my response, then had to do a couple of edits to fix it with Gioele's voice and attitude, but even more so with the bickering with Raluca. Good gawd they were harsh with one another.</p><p>And ALL the reads.</p><p>Thanks for the ship, lovelies. &lt;3</p>

                <p>So as we all know, I joined as Finola.<br>My first love was Roland, whom I tried to be interested in by making <strong>punny</strong> jokes and random rabble.We didn't seem to click off too well <em>(sexually)</em> so our romance didn't really progress much.</p><p>In the early days Gioele contacted me about the strange feelings he was having and asked me to investigated it. I took a blood sample and sure enough the love serum was in his system. Over the course of the next few days I took blood samples of the crew (either legitimately with permission or via random jabs). With the majority of the crew testing positive I decided that it was necessary to announce it to the crew. Most of the crew didn't take it too well and refused to believe it, while others, slightly concerned came to the conclusions that I was correct. This brought turmoil to the crew and it slowly turned poor Finola insane.</p><p>So over the next few days, while Janice was off prostituting Ian (<img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">) poor poor Finola was loosing it. Physically she was mostly fine, but the thought of a love potion that actually worked? She hated the idea. All her life she had been dedicated to science, for the betterment of humanity and she didn't believe that there was any need for her to fiddle herself with such petty emotions as 'love'. As the number of research assistants she had lowered, she was forced into a deeper and deeper state of insanity.</p><p>It took a while, but finally somebody came to her aid. While Gioele's contact had helped slightly, there was the inherent need for a professional shrink. As Janice was pre-occupied <em>(sexually)</em> Stephen stepped in to cool her down. (Unfortunately I didn't save any of my PM's but there was some pretty good stuff in there.)<br>Did I mention how <strong>EVIL</strong> Stephen was?</p><p>I don't know what went on between Gio and Stephen, or what he said but yeah, you guessed it, Stephen decided to test his new love potion on the two of us..... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"><br>While Gioele had already confessed his love.. *admiration towards Finola, the feelings were not reciprocated. In all honesty I was planning on riding the whole voyage solo because love is ewwy. (foreveralone) But, the love potion did its job. I went and confronted Gioele in the refectory <em>(sexually)</em> and made a discussion demanding he chose between Hua or myself <em>(sexually)</em>. Of course, under its effects he chose me and we banged. mm i liek dat.<br>Well, yeah, then he proposed. Yeah, murder those feelings with love. Of course, Finola was powerless to say no, because why not? Fun times (you evil bastard Stephen! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>While we didn't have a set date yet, we banged very often. Because, why not? Its hot.<br>Hua was clearly discomforted because she was totally missing out (physically, mentally, emotionally and sexually), and while Finola did try and make amends her progress was non-existent. This is where the Bachelorette party came in. Frieda came up with the idea. A whole expo crew of women! Myself, Frieda, Janice, Eleesha, Raluca and Paola. Quite a funny trip filled with sexy (and slimy) aliens which did something weird to Janice's baby, but we didn't really explore that much further unfortunately.</p><p>A few more days past and finally Finola was pregnant. I made a very specific announcement where I let off one important thing: The heartbeat monitor was broken. <em>teeheehee</em>. Anyway, time went on and eventually it came to our wedding day. Only a mere few cycle before we were due to tie the knot, you know what Stephen does? Inoculates about half the crew of the love toxin. This sent shock waves through the ship and affected Paola the most. I wasn't willing to go through with the wedding unless the father of the bridge was there haha! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> She seemed quite conflicted so I ran her and Rolands blood through some random machine and both their results came back negative for the serum. Confused and bewildered, the wedding went on! (If anyone has screens of that, post!)</p><p>We were starting to approach the endgame so it was time for those pesky little shroomies to come clean. Hua was first, literally mutating from emotional distress. (I'm telling you, get more physical, emotional, mental and sexual feelings!!). Finola was, quite obviously quite disgusted, and couldn't even bear the thought of responding to that 'monster'. (Ontop of that I had an assignment to do lol) Gioele was obviously concerned but there wasn't much else he could do.<br>Then came that evil bastard. (Stephen, if you didn't realize! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">) With his reveal of being responsible Finola obviously lost it again. She went to the lab, the only place she felt comfortable and literally exploded. (Not sexually).<br>After mixing some random chemicals and <strong>dropping the base</strong>, she laced the garbage bin with explosive residue, threw in all her research logs and lit it up. BOOM! (Obviously)<br>Finola is flung across the room and knocked unconscious. The (somewhat) heroic Gioele rushed to her aid and put her on the medlab bed somewhat unsure of what to do. He hooked up the heartbeat monitor..<br>Beep. Beep. Beeeep. Beeeep. Beeeeeep..... <em>Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.</em><br>Completely freaking out Gioele grabs the defribrilator and goes to defrib when Finola wakes up and stops him. She hoarsely replies "The heartbeat monitor is broken" and a "I love you" before passing out again.<br>I distinctly remember getting a some kind of angry but thankful OOC response in PM from Gio and I lol'd.</p><p>Anyway that about sums up that awesome er 2.5 week journey? Boy that was fun. HELL OF A LOT OF READING THOUGH! Haha thanks all, you were all awesome!<br>~DMW/Fin out.</p>
