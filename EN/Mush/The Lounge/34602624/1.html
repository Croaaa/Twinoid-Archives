                <p>So, here's the end. <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1777" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1777</a></p><p>Umm. I was Gioele. It was my first time as alpha mush, and my... 8th or 9th game overall. So first of all, I gotta say, sorry sorry sorry. To Roland my fellow mush most of all - but to the whole ship as well. I ruined your mush hunt, no matter what else happened. And looking at that end page, I see maybe a lot of other stuff happened. I see Raluca Quarantined by NERON, I see Finola and Stephen assassinated - and I don't know how or by who. Hope someone supplies details.</p><br><p>When I went to pick my character, for the first time I had only one choice, Gioele. I picked him, and was instantly Mush. That threw me at first, here I am and I now know I don't want to help humans and my inventory is full of cameras... which I cannot drop, I have to install. And here comes Frieda with a PM to me and Chun telling me to put one in the lab, where Chun and I and suddenly Frieda are. Umm... Yeah. Alright; I install it, and get dirty! Booyeah. And so I make the dirty thread (hrm, d2 and no dirty thread yet?) and Frieda promises to come check on me. Alright, Frieda, I answer. I haven't even left the lab yet, come check when you can. And I'm at work, so slow and distracted, but oh so thoughtful about the game.</p><p>Roland, the other alpha mush, wanted to do the slow thing, and I considered it. Through the next couple of cycles. There were people complaining that they didn't get the morale from connection to sol. There were people complaining that maybe Chun hadn't taken last hope - but I could see she had. So I knew that Chun had to have connected late, after D2 started; and from message times I knew the connection to sol had been made before that point. And Chun had only that one skill, so Chun's bronze, hrm. After a bit, I slipped into the empty medibay, noted that it didn't have a camera up, and spored twice (so conveniently already dirty), then settled down for a nap.</p><p>Hrm, and Paola walked off with mush sample, and people are talking about killing her if she wouldn't drop it soon. A couple hours passed, and Paola was killed. Sweet loss of humanity, sweet loss of morale on a ship that already has a few morale issues; I decided to act 15 minutes before cycle change. Roland was offline, but I didn't really think about that or him too much. I figured my partner could enjoy being the solo alpha; I didn't think too much about that. I've only been mush once before, I was a beta mush that an alpha died to turn, it was weird and the ship was already almost dead and I didn't learn much about being a mush. I knew there hadn't been any messages on the mush channel in hours; that I'd made the last message, so my partner was offline. That's all I thought about him... my mind was on what I was to do to mush up this ship.</p><p>So I decided; Chun started with 7 morale, -1 for Paola's death; I can go into the lab and use 6 ap to prep her for death - Chun was still alone in the lab. Then I can go and off Janice one way or another; Janice who was clearly a highly active ship leader and who had helpfully announced she was in alpha dorm. Of course the camera I had to put in the lab's going to catch my use of demoralize; but I don't think even if the player screams about it they can fix it in less than 15 minutes... and Chun has seemed inactive these hours. The roomlog showed that Janice had eaten two bananas; the cryotank log suggested that Janice had been present when the connection to sol may have been made; I decided not to risk demoralize on Janice, but to slay instead.</p><p>I knew where the armor was, so went for that, quietly wishing I could drop my camera but unwilling to waste the AP to install it in some less than useful place, then made my way to Alpha dorm, to be confronted by the high AP cost of Ian's presence. Drat. Foiled! I resolved to make my way to bravo dorm, evaluate who was there, and kill whomever seemed the most harmful for the ship to lose... ideally the one with the highest AP at the moment.</p><p>Ahh, the three people in Bravo Dorm are Jin Su, who just announced he had installed a camera in medibay... I barely missed crossing paths with him, he must not have stepped into the lab, or if he did he didn't look around, he's got leader, he could be a good target, though he's probably low AP.... ahh, Hua! Known to be a pilot, made it back aboard the cycle before and had to wait another cycle to make it to the dorm, that's a 0 AP player surely.... And Roland. Ahh, a second pilot! I check the main logs.... Ooh, Roland's talking about using turrets, making one shot and stopping. That's a player who probably has a lot of AP, and the ship's talking to him about how he should take ships out - that's the player I will kill.</p><p>I pound on him, but cannot finish the kill before cycle change, I'm out of AP. I take his bed. Amazingly, Jin Su is talking beside me, for like 3 minutes until Cycle change, having a conversation on the main thread with some back and forth... he never says a word about the fight that happened in his room.</p><p>Cycle change! Chun suicides! I stand up and punch Roland again, and he dies! Whew, managed that kill. I lay back down in the bed, wide eyed, and wait for the reaction. It is already happening!</p><p>People want to know who killed Chun! Wait! Who killed Roland! It's Gioele! Kill him! I don't even think about hiding by Ian, this is my first manhunt.... first time as prey at least. I start to compose my message to my partner, to inform him that I'm not going to do the slow route with him, but instead I'm going out fast, but hopefully he can enjoy the chaos, here's what I did and my original plan that changed because.... and then I glance down to check who my partner is again, and see.... it was Roland. Dead by my hands Roland. My eyes flick up to the player count: Yep, a dead mush. Blink. Blink. And no human has apparently noticed yet, that there's a dead mush up there -and it couldn't be Paola or Chun... Gioele who killed Roland for 'who knows why' killed a mush.</p><p>It gets noticed, and people call for waiting in killing me - maybe Roland did something to me in another room, maybe I cannot talk but I know Roland did it to me, so I killed Roland but cannot explain why yet. Then the room log is found - Gioele slew Chun! The hunt for Gioele continues!</p><p>Were I smarter, I could have tried to claim to have been Roland, and switched into by Gioele after killing Chun. Might have worked, I dunno... My mind was awash in shame. I had ruined my partner. I stupidly never even thought to check who my partner was - I never even thought to check - when Ian ruined my plans to kill Janice, I switched to a spontaneous plan B, one that did not have much thought in it at all. Stupid, stupid me.</p><p>It took a good bit of AP to kill me at least. And I did finally remember I could and should flee to hide near Ian. Who then moved, and I had nothing to follow him with. I died, eventually, to a heartstab. Sadly, the knife got dropped at one point, and I scrambled to get it - dumb cannot drop camera! - but by the time I could drop italkie, someone else had the knife again.</p><p>So I know Raluca was rushing Pilgred crazy fast, despite protests, and that at least one player was helping reset Raluca anyway. And I see now that Raluca got quarantined sometime after I died.</p><p>How did Stephen and Finola die? What happened with Raluca? What's the rest of this ship's story?</p><p>Roland, will you ever forgive me? I... I'm not sure I'm going to forgive myself for a very long time, but I swear there's no way I can possibly forget to check who my partner is ever again. What a shameful lesson. Sorry guy.</p>

                <p>Err, and I guess it was Finola, not Paola, who had the mush sample and died for it. So it's Paola who I don't know why she died, unless it's because she just kept killing people.... I see she killed Stephen too at some point but it looks like she died about a day after she killed him, and she was slain by Janice, who seemed utterly with it and sensible?</p><p>I'll love the details when/if they come.</p>
