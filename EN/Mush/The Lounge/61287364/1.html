                <p>Hello,</p><p>I'm absolutely disgusted by the playerss' behavior. I explain: I was Stephen and I suspected Jin Su to be the second Mush, because I felt that he tried to protect Andie - the first Mush - that previously put fire on the ship and flew away with extinguishers in Phasiphae, for several reasons :<br>- he didn't want to move the ship to kill Andie<br>- he was incoherent and confuse (he didn't respond to my request to move the ship, he said that Andie was already dead even though it was obviously not - Neron didn't annouce anything -, then just after he said that we must kill Andie ??!!)</p><p>I presented the evidences in a private canal to half of the crew, and demanded that he has to be executed. <br>Then Chun showed up - the only 100% innocent! - and said that I had no evidence, even though for me it was obvious, and I thought that I really well explained the thing!</p><p>Then Jin Su learned that I was accusing him, and he Blasters and kills me like that!! Chun healed Jin Su after that.</p><p>The worst part is that after my death, they insulted me of "newbie" and did fallacious claims on me!!</p><p>Why world is so unfair? I'm really upset, do you think that I did something wrong in this game?</p>

                <p>Try not to be too upset about it, it's possible Chun and Jin Su knew something you didn't that made your claim less believable (eg maybe Jin Su was proven human but it wasn't publicly announced) and you also may have done things that made you look suspicious. If you're a new player, sometimes it can be hard for people to trust that you're actually new and not just faking it as an excuse to do mushy activities (or to not do human activities). It's also possible Chun and/or Jin Su just made a mistake. There's not really any way to tell from your post. Either way I find I have more fun in Mush if I don't take it too seriously.

                <p>I don't want to get into a heated argument about this, and the reason i responded in the first place is because your op post feels like it's trying to slander me. I understand that you're upset and i can assure you that no one tried to intentionally insult you. I've found that talking about mistakes and rationalising decisions in the game is standard etiquette in this community, it's not meant to belittle anyone.</p><p>I'm going to respond to your concerns from my point of view so we can learn and improve from them.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_9574036 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="9574036">Mikaxo</span></span><cite>I told you why dammit!! It was because <strong>I couldn't technically</strong>, you had to many private chanels</cite><p>I'd like to clarify that my problem with it was that you acted on your own rather than consulting me. You made no attempts to get me into the channel by perhaps telling me to clear pm's.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_9574036 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="9574036">Mikaxo</span></span><cite><p>I didn't know about 'mag net'.</p><p>Jin Su also said that there no need to develop mag net because Andie was already dead, even though that was not the case (Neron should have announced that).<br>I thought that this was a clumsy lie attempt to protect her.</p></cite><p>This is an understandable mistake. As has been pointed out though, andie was in removed from her patrol ship.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_9574036 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="9574036">Mikaxo</span></span><cite>He didn't said that! I think he said there no need to move the ship, that's all, he didn't said that "we should move later". <br>And when I ask him to do so in a private chanel, he didn't do anything or even respond me (i know he connected meanwhile, so he could) ; and when finally fire burnt the terminal order, he responded with the excuse "the terminal is broken".<br>Like who would not think that he tried to protect her???</cite><p>I maybe should have been move clear, by "later" i meant that he said it at a later time. as in "we should move", said in a later time.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_9574036 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="9574036">Mikaxo</span></span><cite>And you said nothing more, like no argument at all no convince me that I was wrong, you just said "you have no evidence".</cite><p>Correct, i was expecting you to bring up arguments in favour of your stance.

His hand was forced when you publicly told everyone to kill him. There was probably two things going trough his head, you had been converted to mush or you weren't acting in favour of humans for other reasons (not sanctioned by other humans). In my opinion both of those reasons are good enough to kill for.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_9574036 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="9574036">Mikaxo</span></span><cite>How the hell didn't you suspect him?? Like a Mush spotted who killed the only one who suspect him, this didn't go through your mind? You just said "come in medlab my little Jin Su, I will heal you".<br>Sorry but your reasoning is messy.´</cite><p>I didn't suspect him because there wasn't enough evidence and he had been doing human actions troughout the game. My reason for healing him was simple, to prove his innocence. Healing an illness is a way to prove humanity in this game.</p><p>In any case, i don't mean to create controversy and i don't fault you for not understanding parts of the game, everyone has a hard time learning this game when they start because it's a difficult game. I just want to make my side of the story clear because it felt like your side of the story was unfair to me. So i'm just going to leave this at that and not respond anymore, i feel like my voice has been heard now.</p>

Mush is first and foremost a team game and if you act outside the team's interest, you'll be considered a rogue agent by the team. I don't fault you for any reasoning that you think is correct that you bring up now (even though i disagree with that too), but the ship didn't happen in this thread.

                <p>Alright, Mikaxo, listen to me. Listen to me because I am the same selfish, perfectionistic lil thug playing for own favor as you are.</p><p>I wasn't on the ship, but I've read the whole thread. As far as I understand Andie's message ejecting themself into space and NERON's accouncement of Andie's death were in different time and meanwhile Jin Su realized that and said it was not worth installing the Magnetic Net. There was nothing Jin Su could do. Moving the ship doesn't affect the whole situation.</p><p>The rest was just a misunderstanding from both sides: you and Jin Su. But overall, you should learn that being right is not the concept of the game. Rationality is not always understood by other people and they prefer choosing the more convenient for them way. Even if you know all the Mush team and suddenly get killed when they survive to witness human loss, you shouldn't spread your madness and show everybody that you were right. Being right helps, but it's not a thing to brag about nor a main factor of the game.</p>

Andie and Paola were the alphas and they never made betas. And this attitude still stinks. It's passive-aggressive to go around with an attitude of "well I'm always right but if the rest of the crew <em>wants </em>to be wrong, that's their business". The fact is, even very good mush hunters can be wrong sometimes, and you thinking yourself "rational" doesn't mean that everyone who disagrees with you is irrational. Two people with two different sets of facts, or who place different weights on the facts, can both be rational and come to different conclusions, because rationality isn't magic wand.</p>

                <p><cite>Stephen is sensed to be the chief, I mean that's normal that he is in refectory taking care of food... And i was proved innocent</cite> Just that sentence shows that you don't know the game as well as players on your ship or in this thread. Staying in the refectory is not advisable, proven innocent or not, since you can easily be converted and your presence does not even protect the food from being infected. <br> <br>So please listen to what people have to tell you, instead of maintaining that you were right and refusing to understand the explanations. Making mistakes is fine, refusing to acknowledge them will not help you learn.</p><p>And please change the title of your thread, or mods will do it for you. That kind of title is not acceptable.</p>
