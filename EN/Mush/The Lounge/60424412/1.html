The ship : <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/12039" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/12039</a></p><p>Wonderful holiday ship, with an amazingly active crew, composed mainly of beginners (or relative beginners) with a handful of more experienced players. We arrived at Eden on D17, after a very stressful last day.</p><p>The mush hunt was easy at first, with poor newbie Gioele who extracted a spore in front of people as soon as he became mush. Finding Eleesha was more difficult, but when she erased the BD logs, a painful study of RC and BB logs led us to deduce that she had done it. She gave us quite a few headaches, though, because we weren't sure for a long time if she had converted someone. It turns out that she had spike useless Jin Su twice (but we killed him for being barely active), and then useless Roland three times, but by then we had Mushovore bacteria and she couldn't convert anyone.</p><p>The rest of the trip went smoothly, with quite a lot of fun and roleplay, which was really enjoyable. And a <strong>lot</strong> of jumpkins. We found the first two starmaps quite easily, but eventually had to explore a scary volcano / seismic planet in order to find the last one. The expo crew survived&nbsp;and came back with the starmap !</p><p>A few screenshots :</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/d/4/ff57a228_516.jpg">Fuel tanks or not fuel tanks</a><br><em><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/5/e/fd582084_516.jpg">♪ Following the leader, the leader, the leader... ♫</a></em><br><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/d/2/7d6eed6b_516.jpg">Derek's "luck" in scanning</a><br><em><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/1/6/d8768fba_516.jpg">♫ Santa Claus is coming to town ♪♪</a></em><br><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/4/e/e05c8f34_516.jpg">Santa's evil twin</a> ... or <a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/2/1/f018f6d1_516.jpg">his ghost</a> ?<br><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/a/2/a386dff2_516.jpg">THE planet</a><br><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/4/8/2dde26c8_516.jpg">Derek sounding his own death-knell</a> You're dead meat, Hogan.<br><a target="_blank" href="https://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/4/3/9eef77cb_516.jpg">Pre-Eden jumpkin party</a></p>

                <p>Terrence here, certainly was a hell of a game. I apologize for being so inactive during the last week, however, I can only hope I redeemed myself by volunteering to go to the final planet.</p><p>I enjoyed hacking the terminals whenever necessary, and being part of that initial mush hunt. I honestly have never seen defacer before, which made things interesting. Props to Eleesha, who didn't have much of a chance, given that she was by herself.</p>

                <p>Andie here!</p><p>That was a great ship! People were fun and active despite a chunk of them being new. I wasn't really able to participate too much in the mush hunt. I kinda just sat there confused when Terrence called for Gioele's head after he openly spored (Had no idea where the two were). Poor little noobie Gioele. When Eleesha eventually acted I kind of just sat on the bridge and... uh... Assisted...? By using lots of words?... I guess.</p><p>I didn't really know how to roleplay Andie. Most people just focused on gender ambiguity being the entire character. I just decided to pick a gender and stick to it. I wanted to make him as brown-nosey as possible. Complimenting everyone, getting in the good graces with the people in charge. I had trouble committing to it, though. Andie is just one of those characters I have trouble with as I generally like playing comic-relief characters.</p><p>Things ran smooth for a long while until we hit about Day 14-15, most late-game players know that that's the turning point when the RNG really starts to hate you. We just couldn't commit to large-scale scanning while juggling general maintenance/healing. The planets we had at the end were pure crap. The talks started. To go to Sol or try to keep scanning. I told them I was ready to risk myself doing solo expeditions on the volcanic/seismic planet. Some crew were against even going to it, I understood their worries but it was clear the ship was going to end very soon and I wanted to try. Eventually I was talked into having 4 people go with the Icarus and risk losing the whole party. We got ridiculously lucky on that <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/22733">expedition</a>. Part of me hoped to die to the seismic just for drama's sake. Haha.</p><p>Anyways, it was a great ride and I thank everyone who was a part of it!.. Except Jin Su... lole</p>

I wonder what Stephen would look like with a glittery moustache. I for one found your Andie quite pleasant to interact with.</p><p>And that cucumber conversation... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><cite><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"> NERON<br>Alert, detection of hostile vessels within range of the Daedalus!
