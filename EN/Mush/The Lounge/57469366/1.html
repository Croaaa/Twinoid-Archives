                <p>Yes, The Thing. That ugly, slimy octopus-like thing with disgusting tentacles. I don't care what you all think, I don't care if you refused to burn that mush sample in the combustion chamber, I am going to throw it into the first volcano I find. Hopefully there will be a volcano on Eden. If not, I will look on nearby planets. Or maybe I can try to pour RFS on it, and it will be like holy water on a vampire, it will shrivel and burn and die.</p><p>Anyway, I swear I shall get rid of that Thing. It taunted me for two weeks, free as a <span class="tid_strike">bird</span> squid, roaming around the ship and lazing about while I was stuck in the lab, enduring poking and prodding from people who didn't even know how to use a needle properly. THAT IS TOTALLY UNFAIR.</p><p>You know what ? I'm so mad at the unfairness of it all that I won't talk about what happened on that ship. Dead mush shrink, dead human comms officer, dead handicapped mush, starmaps, artefacts, Raluca's moustache, jumpkin binging, Eden... You tell the story if you want. And I am going to look for a suitable volcano.</p><br><p>The ship : <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/10622" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/10622</a> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"></p>

I haven't gotten there even once &lt;/3<br>Someone please do tell the history, seems like it will be fun.</cite><p>I am not complaining about going to Eden, I am complaining about being treated cruelly while the mush sample was allowed to escape from the lab. It wandered happily around the ship and ended up spending the last days in the Nexus, partying with the cat and that green jelly thing that looks like an alien brain on four legs. I'm pretty sure they drank the retro-fungal serum and ate the starmaps because they look like candy.</p><p>As for the story... Don't ask me why Raluca had a moustache, I have no idea. And I suppose you're not interested in the fact that Kuan Ti punched Stephen out of jealousy, that Ian is the unluckiest Mad kube player in the universe, or that Andie hates cows (the feeling is mutual).</p><p>We caught the mush quite easily, especially Terrence who was a tutorial player and never left the lab, which made him easy to find once we noticed that he wasn't starving. Kudos to Janice, she tried her best as a solo mush against a very active crew with very experienced mush hunters. She nearly converted Andie, and tried to trick us by making a fake Neron Depression announcement. Unfortunately, she made a few mistakes when she copied the announcement from Mushpedia, and while a less attentive crew could have believed the Bios settings had been changed, we checked everything and saw nothing different. Lying about Plasma shield being deactivated sealed her fate, as several of us had seen with our own eyes that it had always been activated. It was well tried, though.</p><p>Although we were almost sure at that point that Terrence was the second mush, we then proceeded to get rid of Paola, because of her very poor work at a crucial time. I had sent her a message telling her that she had to decode the D3 base and sell Terrence as soon as possible, since we needed to move and get oxygen. Her only reply, several hours later, was "What do you want ?" ... and she went on snoozing in her sofa. After a few cycles, Terrence was still staring at the wall in the lab, the rebel base hadn't even been started, and we decided that Miss Pink Hair did not deserve her job. So we killed her, then killed mush Terrence, and sold her father to the aliens against Pilgred.</p><p>The rest of the trip went quite smoothly, as the RNG seemed to like us (despite trolling us by breaking the connection to Sol several times and making it difficult to establish). We got tech, shrink and shooter magebooks from Xyloph, got Pilgred without lifting a finger, and had mostly successful expos from which we brought fruit and various artefacts, including a bottle opener (but without any bottles to open) and four starmaps. We also had a beautiful jumpkin garden after completing Hydroponic Incubator, Extra Hydropots and Heat Lamps all in the same day.</p><p>A great crew, and a very enjoyable ship. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Not since a string of mediocre and frustrating ships. I decided that I would try to jump with some TE in hopes to spark it back up again. It did not disappoint. Usually when you have a large group of TE on board a ship, one or two would end up mush. Surprisingly not! Didn't stop us from wondering about each other, even after the mush were eradicated.</p><p>So, for my Raluca, I wanted to do something a little bit different than the directly aggressive sort of RP. So I kind of made her crazy. She saw all these people who had skills she didn't and wanted to figure out how they obtained them. Since she was born with genius, she was sure they had inherited such skill from something.</p><p>It started with Eleesha where she died her hair orange and made a poor attempt at an afro. She even had a star ornament at the top of one of the spikes (poor afro, remember) that she had plugged into a wall to make it colorful. Like a Christmas ornament.</p><p>Then came Stephen and... Well, he loved that mustache and so did she. So she went around collecting of stray hairs of everyone and everything and slapped it to her upper lip with a strip of scotch tape. A rivalry ensued between them that we didn't get to resolve thanks to my crap long work hours.</p><p>Then there were Derek and Filandra (Frieda). Derek had his strength (pretty much all he had since he couldn't fireman fast enough). He had to teach Raluca how to build muscle. She took it literally and grabbed a hammer but eventually he taught her the ancient art of the "push-up". Before long she was beefy. As for Forza (Frieda), The only thing Raluca could see special about her was her metal-rimmed glasses. Raluca had inferior plastic rims. So Ral set about making a probably-not-safe metal frames out of scrap metal. But it wasn't enough. When Fanta (Frieda) had gotten lost one planet, Raluca saw an opportunity and immediately called dibs on the glasses themselves.</p><p>I didn't get to absorb any of the other crew, unfortunately. AFter the first week, my work started moving again and I just didn't have the time to really do much.</p><p>As for Janice, it was sad to see her go. The day before she was caught she had tried to push people into believing the BIOS settings had been changed but she was the only one to have possibly activated it. I figured, at the time, she was trying to incriminate me as I was the only one in the Nexus. Then the next day came around and she posted her message. For the first minute our first reaction was to believe it. Then Chun mentioned that she was pretty sure it wasn't a cycle change sort of ability. Which got me looking at it. Then I noticed that the punctuation didn't match up with the display picture in mushpedia. Eleesha then commented on how our message was all in caps but the original is not. At that point we *knew* she was lying. The issue was to figure out if it were a joke or not.</p><p>We played like we believed it while we checked to see what had been changed. Couldn't fly out in the patrol ships, efficiency on Research was still higher than normal (priority was set to it and not astro), and Plasma Shield was still kicking. I had asked Janice to see what was changed. It didn't really matter what she had said was changed, if she had even gone to check we'd have known she were Mush. After all, we had already came to the conclusion that she had forged that message. Sure enough, she comes online and heads to the Nexus to check BIOS.</p><p>We had decided that she was too dangerous to let live for RFS. Thanks to Paola's slow work on comms we had no reliable chance for the disk even though we had already suspected our not-starving tutorial Terrence as being Mush. So I obtained the knife and shanked her face.</p><p>The rest of the ship was a breeze, really. I got to teach Kuan Ti some things (He had suspected Chun to be mush early on, it was hilarious). It was definitely one of the smoother Eden ships I've had. Not as smooth as one ship which was pretty much a cruise liner but it's a close second! Thank you everyone for a great ship. =)</p>

A too-quick mush phase where most the action and detective work happened while I was at IRL work. I thought Janice's "suspicions" about NERON Depression were a little odd and noticed the incorrect formatting of the faked NERON message immediately. Of course, this was on a quick peek on my phone during a work break, and she'd already been killed by the time I was functionally online. Chun also murdered Terrence right as I was returning online, so my combat prowess was only used in the service of installing a new comms manager. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We were able to pump out a bunch of projects thanks to Eleesha, and ended up with a rockin' Jumpkin garden that was producing ~15 jumpkins per day.

                <p>Hello from <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"> Frieda everybody! The ship ended right on time for me, just before I had to lose internet access for a few days. But since late is better than never, I'll throw in my thoughts on the ship.</p><p>So for me it started with noticing three friends were already awake on the ship, and for once, I actually had their missing people in my selection! So after debating between Frieda and Paola, I decided to become the ship navigator, a nice woman a bit conscious of her age, calm overall but with a quiet and subdued thirst for thrills. <strong>Chun</strong> popped up not long after me, and then it was clear this was going to be a really fun ship.</p><br><p>It most definitely did not disappoint. <em>Janice</em> drew some suspicion quite quickly, actually. <strong>Andie</strong> had Confidante, and yet despite that Janice declined a simple opportunity to confide in him soon after moving through BD. When the "NERON announcement" went out, although I noticed it looked different, I wasn't sure it was <em>not</em> genuine. But thanks to her earlier behavior, I still suspected Janice was the one behind it, either with Vocoder or by actually using the ability herself. It was only while saying all of this to Chun that I recognized the weird appearance as an all-caps Vocoder message. By this time though, Chun was already organizing the kill. Though I might have preferred rushing the cure for Janice, who had seemed like a nice enough player, Chun pointed out that Janice had probably spiked Andie already and could possibly be ready to convert him, and she wasn't willing to risk that.</p><br><p>The fateful message: <a href="http://oi68.tinypic.com/zmgih5.jpg" target="_blank">http://oi68.tinypic.com/zmgih5.jpg</a></p><br><p>It was sad that we ended up having to get rid of Paola, as her LE was sorely missed and I was forced to shuttle between the Bridge and the Medlab every few cycles after losing her. But her being so useless at Comms forced us to have to kill Janice rather than rush the cure after taking out Terrence, who by this point would have starved to death if he had been human. But after that and one more trade for PILGRED, the ship was a pleasant ride all the way to Eden. We had a bit of a squeeze trying to find O2 in the first few post-Mush days, but we never had any serious issues after that.</p><br><p><em>Jin Su</em> did indeed turn some heads when he took Cold-Blooded after selection; no one thought he was Mush for that per se, since the skill doesn't work for Mush... we were just a little bit annoyed at the choice of such a mediocre skill on a clearly active ship. But we forgave him eventually. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And there was even a bit of fun from it, regretting when some of were recovered from an MIA and robbing Jin of some AP, or him suggesting that he put his skill to use by pulling the ship out of orbit during an expo for an easy 12 AP. ((Though that was definitely less funny <strong>when</strong> he said it... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)) In the end, our loyal captain was a reliable and valued member of the crew.<br><a href="http://oi66.tinypic.com/x3g806.jpg" target="_blank">http://oi66.tinypic.com/x3g806.jpg</a> [bottom to top]</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8046890 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8046890">BadBlanket</span></span><cite>The rest of the ship was a breeze, really. I got to teach Kuan Ti some things (He had suspected Chun to be mush early on, it was hilarious))</cite><p>Leave Kuan Ti alone! He may have been new, but he was happy to learn and honestly, he might have been on to something... <br><a href="http://oi66.tinypic.com/24zdt2v.jpg" target="_blank">http://oi66.tinypic.com/24zdt2v.jpg</a> [also bottom to top]</p><p>In the beginning, I was unsure about how our expeditions would turn out with our heavy dependence on <em>Andie</em>'s activity, but he was ready for every expedition, and did a fantastic job preparing for every trip, and we owe him a whole lot for our success. And also, thanks to <em>Ian's</em> efforts we were able to enjoy a ridiculous amount of fruit towards the end, a whole lot more than we ever ended up needing. <em>Eleesha</em> was a star with Comms work, and <em>Derek</em>, well... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>A big thanks goes out to <strong>Chun and the Mush Sample</strong>, whose efforts towards research and running the ship helped keep all of us afloat. Though I am a bit sorry for the poor Mush sample, as she ended up being Chun's favorite victim whenever she felt like lashing out. <br>But let's not forget she had others... <a href="http://oi68.tinypic.com/2mq12ir.jpg" target="_blank">http://oi68.tinypic.com/2mq12ir.jpg</a></p><p>I have to say though, for me <strong>Raluca</strong> was the MVP among many great players. Many times I would read what she had to say and laugh out loud. Her crazy transformations and blunt attitude were a constant source of entertainment on an already lively ship. Some of my favorites:<br><a href="http://oi63.tinypic.com/i5snxf.jpg" target="_blank">http://oi63.tinypic.com/i5snxf.jpg</a><br><a href="http://oi64.tinypic.com/2la4uj8.jpg" target="_blank">http://oi64.tinypic.com/2la4uj8.jpg</a> [bottom to top]<br><a href="http://oi63.tinypic.com/10ypelc.jpg" target="_blank">http://oi63.tinypic.com/10ypelc.jpg</a></p><br><p>Thanks for the ship everybody. It was a great time, and unlike D15 ships can sometimes be. this one was pretty low-stress. The occasional RP kept things fun. I would happily ship with any of you again soon, and hopefully we will. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
