                <p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Jin Su listens with a heavy heart as the screams of Ian, Hua, Chun, and Roland fill the air around him. They knew full well that an unstable volcano inhabited that planet, but they had no choice. They needed to reserve the ship's oxygen supply, so they put their lives on the line for the sake of everyone else..a line so fragile that the simplest of breath could sever it into two. He shakes his head slowly after filling his lungs with what little air remained, exhaling from the bottom of his heart in memory of his crew that did not return.<br><br>He then rose up from his bed and examined his tracker. A mush was still onboard the Daedalus. His Daedalus. There was no hope left for survival, but he was not going to die without a fight. Eleesha was out in a patrol ship. Could it be her? Or perhaps someone else? 'She would be the easiest to eliminate..I'll just leave her behind.'<br><br>And so he did. Eleesha's screams fell on empty ears as the Daedalus left her in ship in orbit, proceeding on towards its grave. Jin Su checked his tracker once more. One mush still remained. He shook his head and screamed into his walkie. "Who is it?! The helpful Paola, dedicated to her duty? The silent Kuan Ti, who kept Neron going? The 'newbie' Janice, who hasn't once complained about morale? Or the equally silent Finola, who rarely contributed to research?"<br><br>No response. Time was running out, and Jin Su's heart weighed heavily with the deaths of his crewmates. He fumbled and his way towards the Medlab and sat on the steel floor, his back resting against the wall. He breathed desperately for air, looking over towards Paola who slept nearby. He reeked of fuel, was clearly fatigued, and Neron's warnings would not cease across the ship that Eleesha had been left behind.<br><br>He took up a pen and began writing a note for Paola. "I know I'm dirty. I know I abandoned Eleesha. And I know that I've condemned this ship without even trying to survive with just the six of us. But the mush has to die. You're the lucky 25% I chose to trust, so fight for humanity and avenge us all..or kill me, and win for your disgusting race. It's your choice."<br><br>And with that, Jin Su put his pen down, the last of his energy flowing into the mission report that now rested beside Paola's head. His last hope. Humanity's last hope. He closed his eyes as the sound of the Medlab's door echoed across the room. Jin Su could hear footsteps approaching him as he opened his eyes one last time to see who his guest was. "Oh but Captain..I did contribute to research." whispered Finola with a grin as Jin Su could feel her hand violently making contact across his face. She reached for one of the medical instruments nearby and proceeded to bludgeon him endlessly, each contact sending inexplicable pain through his body until he could feel no more..think no more..breathe..no more.</span></span></p><p>Yeah..that ship ended with our most active crew members going on an expo for O2 that also had a volcano. They found 32 units and food but they all died. To avenge their deaths, I wanted to root out the mush before we all died. I'd say that I failed to do that, because Finola willingly came out to do so. But I think Paola avenged me and slowly died with Kuan Ti in the end, so that's my depressing story to add to yours! I'll add a more humorous one some other time, maybe from my Stephen ship several..several ships ago.</p>

                <p>Janice was a mentor, a friend. Someone to trust. She'd taught Paola everything she knew. And she was mush. But deep down Paola wondered, was Janice really gone. just a shell? She looked at the mage book she'd used to study psychology and found a note. "I know that our crew is infected. I suspect Imight be. If I am, kill me." Chun, Ian, Freida... They knew. They were ready to kill Janice. But Paola felt this was her thing to do. So she left for the medlab with a heavy heart and saw Janice on the bed. So fragile, so trusting, even as a mush. And Paola kicked her. One, twice. And Janice was no more.<br>"I'll be in the shower" She told the rest of the crew.</p>

                <p>I'm on Mush-vacation, so here's a blurb that actually happened in my last ship. <a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/hWw40w/1">Here's the link to the whole thing if you're curious!</a></p><p>Note: I was mush and the ship was low on oxygen, sitting on the verge of death when this happened.</p><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Roland's Last Stand</span><div class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay"><p>Raluca controls the fuel and oxygen and Frieda controls the star charting. We have the ship in lockdown and the girl is mine. Everything is beautiful, until Eleesha starts squawking again.</p><p>“I DIE PROUD. I DIE FREE. I DIE A HUMAN. ANTI-MUSH LEAGUE FOREVER!!”</p><p>“YOUR ANTI MUSH LEAGUE CAUSED THE DEATH OF HUMANITY! CUT THE CRAP.”, Finola hisses rolling out of bed.</p><p>“Mandatory Executions will be held midday tomorrow! All crew members excluding Chao and Chun will draw a number from the pool! Mandatory breeding will be instated! League members get first rights!”</p><p>“Tomorrow? You wont live until tomorrow!” Finola cries just as NERON declares her to be new Captain. Jin Su is dead. Finola's first order as a captain was simple: “<strong>GUT HER LIKE A FISH!</strong>” Even without the orders from my special one I still would have gladly killed Eleesha. New wounds for old wounds.</p><p>We chased her down to the Rear Bravo turret. Finola was shouting, furious and so full of fire. Oh yes, I picked the right one! Eleesha dodges down the hall away from Finola, just barely ahead of me. NERON is announcing deaths: Chun and Raluca. Rest well little sister. Over the intercom I hear Eleesha's laughter.</p><p>“Your Empress is dead. She has shed her mortal form. She is now a GOD! She demands human sacrifices at midnight! All crew members including league members will draw staws.”</p><p>I corner Eleesha in the central corridor. She turns to me. It's clear she has finally lost what little sanity was left. “As her most trusted priestess. I will be the first to be sacrificed. It is truly a great honor!”</p><p>I take out a little souvenir I picked up while running through storage and pull the pin. Eleesha is splattered across the walls. The Anti-Mush Coalition is over.</p><p>The air is thinning now. I am holding out as best as I can. There's the door to the turret where Finola lies still, conserving oxygen. I come to Finola's side and I hold her as the ship is dying. I'm not sad: all missions were accomplished and we'll live on in the spores of our children. Freida is crashing the ship into a planet for us. See you next life, love...</p></span></div>
