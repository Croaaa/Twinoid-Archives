                <p>So a totally crazy game did just end with a win for the mush.</p><br><p>I played Ian and yeah the ship was totally confusing because that many players acted very strange.<br>It all begun with Janice suspecting Kuan-Ti of being a mush because he invented a useless neron project while we already had decided to invent the regenerating plasma shield.<br>There was very much discussion about whether we should kill him immediately or whether we should give him the chance to defend himself although some people said that it wouldn't be useful because he did not say a single word until that time.</p><p>So we decided to wait and ask him to explain this action, but at the next day (he did not say anything) Janice went a bit crazy and firstly killed Stephen because she was just suspecting him (he was human) and later she also killed Kuan Ti (who was also human &gt;.&lt; )<br>After this two kills we decided to kill Janice because she seemed very suspicious killing two humans during a short time.<br>Well we killed her and she also had been a human...</p><p>We were a bit frustrated because 3 humans had been killed by other humans and we still did not have got any clue who could be the real mushs. But it got far far worse.<br>The next day Chao killed Eleesha (yay another human killed..) without any explanation. We decided to kill him because he also did never say a word in the chat and was only killing a human without any reason. We killed him and another human was dead, killed by humans.<br>Shortly after this Raluca died because of a fatal depression but well she was inactive anyway.</p><p>So we had 6 dead humans and still no single mush activity detected. At this point we had around 6 active people left. I discussed very much with Gioele and Hua who could be the mushs (super game guys <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">).<br>Chun, Roland and Paola were also quite active but did not communicate that much at this point. Terrence and Finola did also log in from time to time but did also communicate only very few.<br>Jin Su did behave very strange. He was logging in from time to time but did never say a single word to us. We tried several times to contact him via a private message but he just left the chats without a single response and Frieda was totally inactive.</p><p>We were running vey low on oxygen so we decided to kill Jin Su because we had to move the ship and also because he was behaving the way he did, never saying a single word to us. Again another human was killed by humans.<br>Then everything went quite fast because the mush (yeah we did really have got an active mush on board although we were doing all the work for him <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) sabotaged the oxygen tanks.</p><p>During the day Paola, Finola and Terrence died because of the lack of oxygen. So only Hua, Gioele, Roland, Chun, inactive Frieda and me were stil alive.<br>At the next cycle Roland did kill Chun and revealed himself being the single active mush with Frieda being the other one. That made sence because there were only 2 mushs shown in the list above. (little did I know)</p><p>At the next cycle Gioele died because of asphyxiation. I had boosted my AP with sleeping, food and Gioele (who had been the new commander and gave me an assignment before he died) and now had 12 AP.<br>I went to Roland and tried to kill him, I also had the blaster but well because I was Ian I needed 3 AP for each attack and so I could only land 4 attacks with one of them missed.<br>But I was hoping for Hua to log in again so that he can finish Roland off.<br>Later when Hua was online I stood in a room with Roland (he had tourned guard mode on) in the alpha bay and Hua was in the alpha dorm.I brought some food for him and thought that we should be able to kill Roland together and maybe also kill Frieda later. But the game should end very different...</p><p>I was chatting with Hua about killing Stephen and then he told me that he was also mush. I did not really expect that and he told me that Stephen managed to infect him the day before but he used his anonymous skill very fast. I was watching the mush counter at that time because I was a bit suspicious about Hua or Roland being a mush but it seems like I refreshed the page a little bit to late.</p><p>Well so in the end I died at the next cycle because of asphyxiation.<br>The only three remaining people were the mushs Roland, Hua and Frieda winning the game.</p><br><p>So thank you for the game guys <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It was really exciting with not having got a clue who could be the mush, although it was a bit sad that so many people went crazy just killing other humans.<br>Also good game Roland! I did not expect you being a mush.<br>At the end a special thank to Gioele and Hua it was a lot of fun to discuss with you who could be the mush (although we did not have been very successfully <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">)</p>

                <p>Well I played Gioele. It certainly was an interesting game in the end. It was a shame most of the madness that overtook the ship was the result of players...playing the game but not speaking or interacting with the crew in anyway.<br>Roland I have to give credit to. Was so busy thinking the Mush was one of these strange players that I just never thought it would be you. Always slightly helpful but never very helpful...heh. Also seriously...Hua became Mush? That better have happened after I was dead because otherwise NOOOOO!<br>I love how Janice really did want to kill me for defending the...odd Kuan Ti. Guess our game shows what can happen when players jump straight to killing after someone makes one mistake or acts a little strangely...total massacre. ((Yet I myself only killed one person in the end. Hell I tried to defend every single one of the inactives or strange people at one point. And I was...right lol. Though on the last day I did go screw it go with hunches))<br>Good work Ian and Hua. And everyone who did actually try to play. I still had some fun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Roland here! That was an awesome ship. Weird, crazy but awesome!<br>Mostly I just leaned back and watch the others kill each other, until you seemed to calm down. And when I started sabotaging stuff I always wondered, if someone will notice... actually you will still get paranoid as the mush, maybe even more than when playing human. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>Remember that oxygen capsule, that Hua collected from the hunters, and I added to the tank? During the next cycle change I immediately removed that oxygen again... I really feared that someone would notice the loss of 2 oxygens at the same time, but... nothing.</p><p>Then when I slept with Hua and converted her, I was so sure, that soon everyone will know. It all felt so suspicious, and then Hua even extracted spores in my presence, which means everyone could see it in the logs! But lucky for us, no-one checked that log. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Anyway, that's the point when I wanted to end this, and sabotaged the oxygen tanks, which worked surprisingly well. The 25% chance always worked for me this time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In conlusion I had so much fun on this ship, and I hope everyone else had, too! The only thing I regret is, that we couldn't convert Gioele in the end... Hua already got two spores on you! Pity that I had already had used my spore on Hua for the day and had to wait for so long... and then you just died from lack of oxygen, one cycle before your convertion. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p>
