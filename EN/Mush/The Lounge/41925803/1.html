                <p>Why not? Because<a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/HSbX0g/302"> it would be too easy</a>. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5754" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5754</a></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hua.png" alt=":mush_hua_50:" class="tid_ico"> Hua here! That ship was... exhausting, exasperating... but it really paid off in those final cycles. There was also the occasional fun banter, including a Terrence that was oddly fascinated with everyone's choice in skivvies. He found a kindred spirit in Jin Su, who <em>totally doesn't wear womens' underwear, you guys</em>. Hua was a bit creeped out by the whole affair:</p><p><cite><strong>Terrence:</strong> So how are your briefs', Hua?<br><br><strong>Hua:</strong> They are functional, Mr. Archer. And that's all you need to know.</cite></p><p>When everyone awoke, we were met with the reality that there wasn't a single person aboard with the Technician skill. Everyone who normally has Tech was bronze and level 1, except for me who was silver with level 2. So both showers were active for the ship's duration, and the sofa BP went unbuilt.</p><p>Jin Su and Frieda were the alpha mush, but Frieda was active maybe once (went to the bridge and asked about CPU priority) and started drooling thereafter. Still, the captain was able to pull off a conversion, the final spike of which he actually performed in front of a camera. We should have guessed that was the case sooner, but we assumed he was sloppy and were thankful when his bridge grenade was largely ineffective (didn't kill anyone outright, only broke a door). Janice beat him up and Eleesha finished him off.</p><p>But the next cycle brought a precision strike steel plate on the injured Paola, the only active person on the bridge, and Eleesha immediately went to fill the void. Meanwhile we were gearing up for an expo because O2 was getting critical. Our newbie Raluca had eaten the Astrophysicist magebook so scanning was slow since she had to hide away from people to gain AP. Luckily the planet she was working on was good - O2, Forest, Intelligent Life, Predators, Ruminants, Insects... not terrifically safe, but not evil.</p><p>Janice was set to accompany us because Andie's activity was spotty at best, and that's when mushling Terrence made his move, mutating and killing her. I swatted him a bit, connecting once before I had to back off - the expo had to go on, and I wanted to be sure I had AP to launch. Roland ended up finishing him off, and we just went on the expo with Janice's slot empty. The combat damage worked out okay and we got 16 O2, but Roland went missing and we <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/mX62iR9.png">found him under a rock</a>. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> It was a shame; he was probably the most entertaining Roland I've served with so far.</p><p>The next few days were the exhausting ones. There were so many inactives on the ship, I began to despair of us just dying a slow death, pecked to death by Hunters. Eleesha and I carefully checked the inactives first before looking into active mush suspects, since with only 5 actives left, we wanted to be sure. Frieda ended up being the only inactive not taking starving damage at cycle change. Her death was cheap too, as she must have been reasonably hurt by the grenade days before. Now <em>Eleesha-certified mush free</em>, we focused on shaking Hunters. My AP for a couple days went into sniping Aracks from the pack, but then fires started to hit and I had to burn AP on that instead. I tried to get bossy in chat about priorities and goals, but most of the other non-droolers were only active once every few cycles and couldn't hop on urgent things. Finally, Eleesha pulled Raluca and I into a PM and organized a PILGRED rush. Oxygen was finally getting back down to uncomfortable levels, and the hull was starting to become a problem. It was do or die.</p><p>We met in the engine room D8C1, and that PILGRED rush was probably one of the most exciting cycles I've had on a ship. After days of vaguely hoping for a human Sol victory but watching a whole lotta nothing happen, the three of us took PILGRED from ~47% to completion. Raluca hugged her cat (freed from the grip of the finally-starved Chun) to celebrate the victory. Late the next cycle, Commander Kuan Ti took our smoking wreck home.</p><p>Hope to see some of my other comrades check in. Especially from the mush side: you guys were sneaky enough (or we were blind enough) that you had the luxury of acting instead of being forced to <em>re</em>act. I'm especially interested in the "surprises" that Jin Su boasted about leaving around the ship before his demise. A bluff, or not?</p>

                <p>Jin Su here. Yeah, I had pieced together a plan to seize both grenades and nuke the dorm, but when I saw the opportunity to infect Terrence I put that to a halt and waited for the chance to spike him. Too bad he didn't leave the Nexus until it was too late, so in the end I had to rush things a bit.</p><p>Still, that grenade was about as powerful as a nerf ball.

                <p>I was Eleesha on this one.</p><p>This ship was massively frustrating in some ways but ended up being one of my favorite voyages of all time. Hua was a lot of fun to plot with. Raluca was an amazing newbie. Kuan Ti pitched in with some key jumps and firefighting at the end. Andie and Ian didn't seem to log in very often, but they did just enough to help keep us alive. This felt like a ship that would end in a slow, depressing death by either lack of O2, hunters chipping away at the shield, or mass suicides. Even though we did end up with 6 active people, it seemed like very long odds.</p><p>The underwear banter was weird and fun.</p><p>If Frieda had been active the human side would have had no chance. As it was we barely avoided any suicides at the end (I racked up three psychological disorders) and we had 4 fires burning, about 18 pieces of broken equipment including literally everything in the Engine Room except the PILGRED terminal, and a ton of hunters on us with our armor dropping fast when Kuan Ti brought us home. We plowed through over 50% of PILGRED in D8C1 just with physicist Raluca and two non-techs relaying.</p><p>Suspicion on Terrence was high since I didn't think Jin Su would spike under a camera unless he was getting a conversion. Still, it was a few cycles between the spike and when Terrence moved, so I didn't see how he could have taken anonymush without anyone noticing. I thought there was good chance that he was mush but that the other Alpha had taken anonymush. Well done on that. Looking back I'm not sure if the best plan was to rampage or lay low. Killing Janice almost wrecked us ... like I said I'm still surprised none of us died from morale at the end, and we wouldn't have lasted much longer. Laying low would have been tough too, since we had no idea who the other Alpha was.</p><p>Jin Su, I was closing in on you when you struck. I'd seen an unexplained trip into CBS that I should have known that was grenade related, and your insistence that nobody read the Biologist book really didn't sit well. Luckily I took and hid the first grenade during my initial inventory, right after mush selection. (I generally don't do anything or even leave the lab until a ship's filled.) So you picked a good time to act, and between you and your minion you nearly knocked us out.</p><p>Anyway, thanks to everyone for a great ride. Janice and Roland were fun, we really missed you two.</p>
