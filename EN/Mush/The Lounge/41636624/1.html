                <p>Hi all, Alpha Mush Eleesha reporting in. As the voyage has abruptly ended, some of you may be curious what went down exactly. Roland and I were Alpha Mush, with Roland being a bronze first time Mush player and me being a fairly experienced Silver.</p><p>I logged on a couple of cycles after mush selection, and I saw that mush research was being performed rapidly it's something like D2C6 and ASG is already at 96% or so. As my philosophy is that the first day determines the entire game, I see Paola has asked for a coffee and a ration to be brought to her. Despite Paola being a terrible mush due to her responsibilities, I take the opportunity as it arises, bringing her a ration and working on comms, then going back to the refectory using all four spores, spiking the coffee three times and phagocyting the fourth for AP so I can move. The coffee is dropped off at bridge, and Paola is as good as turned. Along the way I tell people I'm hitting comms and then going to finish ASG once that's done. I also tell Paola that the food is safe because I haven't visited BD yet and she can see I worked on comms so I mush have been clean - this is the reason I took two trips to comms, as I could probably get away with this.</p><p>To cover my tracks I go ahead and use my free IT points to finish ASG, and then start mycoscan and say I'm waiting for relays. I then invite Stephen and Chun into the mush hunt, based on Stephen working 4 times on ASG and Chun being Chun.</p><p>Paola doesn't log on for quite awhile, but when she does, she becomes mush. Unfortunately, Paola decides to basically grief the mush. She uses both spores for the day for no reason, then attacks Frieda, failing to kill her and not using the spores for anything. Frieda kills her, and the easy mush victory is out of our grasp - not only has Paola ineffectually suicided, I'm now stuck being comms officer which makes it very hard to infect other people as there's almost no reason to get dirty. I report Paola to the SDF for her actions.</p><p>At this time, I get invited the an anti-mush channel started by Derek - my working on anti-mush research is paying off. I contact Roland for the first time to tell him to lay low - his sabotage of the Pasiphae has drawn attention to him. Somehow, people are convinced not to kill Roland, despite him being 100% culpable. At any rate, I'm now in a Xanatos Gambit - if they don't kill Roland, of course that's good, and if they do kill Roland, I'll simply tell them that all the list is printed, all the mush are dead, and we can just work on going to sol/eden. As Paola was turned so early, this is highly likely to work.</p><p>Andie and Ian are the primary suspects, Frieda is pushing heavily for Ian to be killed when she dies on the first expo. Plans were made to turn Gioele (as commander) after he and Stephen got hit by the crystalite, but Roland's inexperience kills the plan - he's used all his AP prior to the expo, rendering any turning play impossible unless he stays until day change, which he doesn't. Turning attempt aborted. A riskier turning attempt is considered as now Gioele is at bridge alone with me - a cam is there, but nobody visits bridge anymore since gioele is both captain and astronavigator, so I can probably turn him and get away with it, especially if I use defacer. This plan is also aborted due to mushovore being completed. Griefer Paola strikes again.</p><p>Both me and Roland are lying low, me because I'm comms officer and Roland because we know he's under suspicion. I get asked to eat several times, but I'm making adequate progress with my IT points, so nobody really seems to suspect me. Eventually Roland does enough work that he's no longer especially suspect, so he spores once under pretense of working on pilgred. Gioele hits me off the bed, which inspires me to work on xyloph until the comms goes down, giving me an extended excuse to get off the bridge...and so of course I get dirty drinking my coffee - the least giving AP food item that also keeps me from being suspect for not eating. I spore twice, wash, and wait for an opportunity.</p><p>The second expo is the opportunity I'm waiting for. Four active players is a probable win, and I search through the ship for the grenade, but do not find it. Unfortunate, but the ship must go on. In addition, I've noted that Derek has gone inactive, meaning he's a 12 AP killing machine, and he's layered into the plan. The plan is simple. There is only 11 fuel and we are low on oxygen, so a 9 fuel hack will leave the ship down 4 players with only 2 fuel remaining and no astrophysicist, and I will also be NERON admin, so I can change settings so non-AP will have a hard time doing anything even if they can surmount the two fuel. Due to checking it the previous day, I have confirmed the hacker kit is in Alpha Dorm. Unfortunately, Janice has the foresight to tell Chun to pick up the hacker kit.</p><p>So, Plan B, kill Chun and hack it anyway. I know Chun is in the medlab because i explicitly told her I gave my bed to her earlier. Raluca is holding onto the knife, so that option is out, but I note that somebody has brought the blaster to the lab, most likely to research the Natamy Blaster. With 20 AP to work with, Chun is as good as dead. At this point, Roland goes active, which is a huge bonus. I tell him to get both lenses, get the blaster and kill Chun while I load fuel (I've been holding onto the scooter all the while). Roland can't quite kill Chun, but 20 AP is plenty to do the job. I kill chun, hack, and 4 of our most active players are dead. I planned on telling Roland to use his spore to spore Derek, but I have enough AP remaining that it's not important, so I extract and spore him myself, taking the opportunity to damage myself a little with a shower, leaving me with 5 hp. Chun, Janice, Terrence, Gioele, and Hua are dead at this point. Frieda died earlier on expo, Paola died as beta mush, JS was killed by Derek.</p><p>I transfer into Derek, who has full hp. I take shooter and wrestler, immediately kill Andie because I know he's carrying a blaster. I take the blaster, kill Stephen because he has quite a bit of AP and is active, and then attempt to kill Raluca. Bad rolls means she doesn't die. Still, 7 kills in one cycle isn't bad. Raluca doesn't go active, and I kill her the next cycle. In the meantime, I tell Roland to tell Kuan-Ti and Ian to kill Eleesha because she's mush. I've also told the entire ship I'm mush several times as Eleesha at this point, and Ian and Kuan-Ti are inexperienced enough that it might work. This leaves me as Derek, Roland as mush, Ian and Kuan-Ti are alive together in lab. I make plans to shove Ian out and kill Kuan-Ti, but it's irrelevant because Kuan-Ti dies of morale loss next cycle. Roland finishes off Eleesha (who was Derek).</p><p>This just leaves Ian, with 10 humans dead in 3 cycles. Ian dying from morale loss isn't viable since he's eating bananas left and right. We discuss finishing Pilgred, or killing Ian, or turning him, but none of them are really that viable because there is a risk of Ian grabbing all the oxygen and starving one of us out. Instead, I direct Roland to grab the oxygen while I do so as well. Unfortunately, Roland is afk, and Ian goes for the oxygen first. Roland dies, and this leaves me and Ian. This outcome is inevitable, since Ian is no match for wrestler and double phagocytes for healing daily mean he has little chance with Ian's low damage output. For the heck of it, I take hard-boiled, which probably isn't necessary. Alas, I am unable to kill him, and the ship blows up from hunters with Ian left with maybe 2-3 hp.</p><p>Mush victory. Overall, reasonably good play from the humans, but you were surprisingly unaggressive about mush hunting. Not that it would have helped you, as your plans were to kill Ian and Andie and there appeared to be very low suspicion towards me. Plan C was after Andie and/or Ian were killed I was planning on trying to put on a witch hunt against Janice, particularly for getting dirty planting the jumpkin - after being dirty something like three times before that despite Janice being a low-dirt role generally. Really, I can't believe nobody called Janice out on the dirty planting with the apron right there. Ah well.</p>

                <p>Janice here.<br>Thanks for writing this, I really appreciate it. Unfortunately I haven't paid attention to 2 or 3 minor things: <br>First one was, that I somehow assumed Paola was Alpha mush. I wondered about her demanding ration and coffee being brought to bridge, and her sudden change of play. Why would she demand those things and then just rampage?<br>You could have been busted though, since your AP spent were more or less low for an IT Expert, but we had to find out about other AP-uses as well. Andie, Ian,... rarely said a word. However, the early conversion of Paola and the sabotage of the Pasiphae made me focus on pilots and didn't visit the bridge again. Should've spent that 2 MP at some point to check...<br>Other suspicious moments were, when you mentioned your morale not being full after D5 Rebel base becoming Gold mid-ship, while mush still alive and the ship wasn't that good.</p><p>Don't want to lose that much words on the expo but at some point I noticed the lack of at least 7+ fuel(didn't keep track of that either, but it was easy to figure out looking in the planets thread), I tried to reach Chun. She was probably offline. Kept refreshing and death screen. Yay...</p><p>Wondering, where the grenades and the blueprint were? I don't know, ask our Chun. I anticipated something like that though and made Chun hide them. Luckily I didn't use that mush-hunting channel. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I was tracking my morale - my morale would have been low as I went through the first day without Chun and in addition I only spent two cycles the entire game in dorm with you. I actually sent you a message prior to mush selection that my morale was low, so it shouldn't have been that much of a surprise that d5 wouldn't top me off.</p><p>Loading fuel and killing Chun would have been done faster, but I was working with a newbie Roland and it took him 5+ minutes to move to kill Chun even with the plan being laid out in detail. I only started loading the fuel after he said he was moving to kill Chun, but he got confused.</p><p>I knew Chun had hid the grenades, but unfortunately hadn't left the bridge in days, any attempt at tracking Chun wasn't going to work so I didn't waste any effort looking for grenades, I was just searching whatever rooms I was already going to with free observant searches - killing was a non-critical part of the plan and there were no rooms with large clusters of people.</p><p>As for Paola, she was out and out griefing the mush, and I reported her.</p>

                <p>I was Roland here. First of all congrats to Sinifish (eleesha) for an amazing mush play. I did the wrong thing sabotagin the pashipae, but i played the newbie rol so good, and also played at a low head pilot, going only from room to bay and back to room again. I also lied my ass off to janice, so at the end their where convinced i wasnt a mush, i had that clear. I explained all this to eleesha who was worried. This is mostly why ive spend all my ap playing as human, when eleesha told me i should spore someone. I played several mush games, but never as a mush. This is why i didnt knew some basics, like my mistake at the begining when i was dirty before mush selection, i went to wash myself trying to get the people calm down about me sabotagin the pasiphae, but i shoulded extract some spores before finally clean myself. I remember the moment when i logged on and saw that an expo was in place, i saw eleesha had wrote something. She was saying she was thinking about moving the ship on the middle of the expo, i thougt this was brilliant, but i couldnt do it myself not even close. I asked eleesha if she was there, with no answer for a couple of minutes. Then it happened, eleesha was on, telling me that we should get the hacker kit. This is so far the best moment playing mush i had. Eleesha said she could do it without help, so i was like "ok, im gonna help if needed". It was in my mind that i had anonymush as my only bronze skill, so whatever eleesha would do, after mush paola's dead, they would probably think both mush where dead. But i was also wanting to take a part of it. Then Eleesha said hacker kit was on chun hands, so she was like game over, lets think another plan. It was my momment, if eleesha could do it all by herself, i could help killing Chun. I told that to eleesha and she agreed. As my first time as a mush i didint knew anything about how the lenses worked, Eleesha explained that to me, and it took me alot of time to finally shoot Chun. I had bad luck at this, missed two shots, then missed two hits or more. Chun was alive. But then Eleesha finish her off and did all the other things. Amazing player as i said, and a good human crew as far i can tell. I sold myself good as a rookie player (i am a rookie player anyway), and eleesha played a migistral role, playing as an important human of the ship and then turning mush all the way down, destroing all hopes for the ship. Great game.</p>
