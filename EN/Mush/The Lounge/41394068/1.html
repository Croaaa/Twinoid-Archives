                <p>Surprise, I was alpha mush again. This time partnered with Janice.</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5539" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5539</a></p><p>Things started out promising because I had an active partner who could level herself up to get infector. I was gleeful in my desire to convert the entire ship, but then my partner relayed C Serum 5 times and on day 1 we lost the chance to get cheap spores. I was beyond livid, but over time I realized that she simply panicked and hadn't been mush in a long time. Slowly but surely I got her to realize that playing too cautiously isn't the way to Mush and after that we began our domination.</p><p>I, Eleesha, hacked the terminal to move us to the planet so technically I murdered idle patroller Roland. Then I left Gio, Hua, Frieda and Derek planetside 2 minutes before their intended return. Thank god Janice got back in time to load the fuel. Our original plan was for me to just hang out on the bridge after hacking and transfer into Jin Su (one of the few inactives on board) to move us. However it became apparent that the expo would be delayed by a sleeping Hua and that Gio would likely become commander by that time.</p><p>So I sat on the bridge, still accessing the command terminal for TWELVE HOURS without anyone noticing. Janice had to run just as the expo was launching and it was the longest 90 min wait of my Mush career to see if she'd get back to reload. She did, 2 mins before they returned.</p><p>Then Phase 2 (cycle 8 ) kicked off. I ran into the medlab and picked up the alarm, spiked Ian and returned to the bridge to remove the camera and transfer into Jin Su. Meanwhile Janice came up to the medlab and spiked Ian twice. I took anonymush, pet the damn cat because JS had 0 morale, and then rushed to AD to take the armor. Janice and I hung out around the medlab to stay under Ian's protection but most of the serious threats were gone.</p><p>Chun came in to punch me once, then reported that Jin Su was the mush and he had skills so there could be no transfer... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Right before day change Ian demoralized Chun and Janice went to stand by Raluca. Andie killed herself at day change and Janice and I rushed to AD to add Stephen to our ranks with Ian taking anonymush. We all went to BD to have beds and Ian's protection but then Janice and I got tired of waiting to see if Stephen would wake, so we went to beat Terrence to death. Then Janice stood by Raluca again and got her to commit suicide.</p><p>This left my old body Eleesha and Paola. Paola played a lot but never actually chatted and couldn't process what happened on the bridge. Stephen had hit Eleesha a few times, and then Paola apparently put no thought into where inactive JS went or why Eleesha was suddenly skill free and beat my former self to death. Technically that's the only death the Mush aren't personally responsible for, but I think we arranged it.</p><p>Then Ian went to the bridge, mutated, and beat Paola to death. Another ship lost to <strong>MUSH SUPERIORITY! <br></strong></p><p>2 Beta mush feels a bit low for how I like to play, but it all worked out in the end. I'd really have liked to get Derek on our side but with C. Serum killing him on an expo made the most sense. If only a blaster had been left on board, Jin Su would have killed everyone much faster.</p><p>Great working with you, Dr. Kent!</p>

                <p>Hello Eleehsu! Janice here, I even did a nrj: <a href="http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/journal/v/398" target="_blank">http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/journal/v/398</a></p><p>Some ships have the Mush turn out to be the most inexperienced or incompetent pair onboard. And then there's our ship.</p><p>I was shocked when I saw the Mush pop-up. My heart jumped. After 15 ships in a row without being Mush at all on the English side, I was so ready for this to happen. It's a good thing I held off getting Apprentice for Stephen last time I played him or I wouldn't have had enough EXP to get Infector <img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I still say my hands were tied on the relays; hogging a bed for two cycles was literally the only thing I had done the entire time. I couldn't fake that I was out of AP or come with any good excuse to get out of there. They had Antispore Gas before I even signed on, and probably would have finished Constipaspore relatively fast even without me. Day One was clearly a watershed for activity on this ship, and going undetected from there seems like it paid off.</p><p>I still can't believe no one noticed Eleesha at the Command Terminal for over half a day...or even asked her to drop the Hacker Kit. Although when it finally took off, after almost a full day of waiting, it was absolutely terribly timed. I had to leave as soon as I saw that it had launched and I had to rush home to get back to my computer before it was over. So sorry again for making you wait on edge for an entire expedition! <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/oups.gif" alt=":anim_oups:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But we put together a nice extended Mush family in the end, and purged the ship of all those pesk humans (besides Roland) in less that 24 hours. We were a great Alpha Mush team, if I do say so myself!</p>
