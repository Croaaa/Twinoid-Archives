The name of the AP is part of Roland's comment on the end page. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/keepcool.png" alt=":tid_keepcool:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It appeared that 'coordinated' because it was done by one player, once all the needed pieces fell into place.</p><p>I started the game as Paola and was picked to be alpha. My partner was Eleesha. She went around doing mushy things, even converted Andie, then started trying to kill him.</p><p>I didn't do anything mushy but pretend to be human (that's pretty darn mushy in my book) until I had set up a means to win (so very very mushy).</p><p>The ingredients: No live hunters, (argh, D3C8 started with 4 hunters... until you precious Roland killed them thank you!), a merchant ship offering a trade of player for Pilgred (came mid D3), a live grand inactive player (Barely happened D3C8 at last), enough AP to accept that trade (2), make sure there's at least 1 spore available to me despite my partner's actions and antispore gas (check, fertile, no AP to make it), enough moves to reach bridge, then find Commander (max of 8 ), enough AP to spike commander (1 or 3 AP, if Ian present), and enough AP to transfer (0 or 2 AP, if Ian present).</p><p>Once in Jin, needed him to have moves/AP enough to reach bridge (4 needed) and 2 AP to jump to sol. Also needed a clear path (no one blocking path to Bridge, or rapidly blowing Jin's head off).</p><p>Gladly, Ian came to join me in medlab D3C8. If he had stayed beside Jin..... If he even -could- have been beside Jin... I would have had to delay that plan longer., because even attempting it revealed me to not be human even more, and I didn't have the AP needed to spike and transfer to Jin if Ian had been beside him</p><p>Anyone could have shot the merchant ships.... to keep my cover I even revealed that yes, we had a merchant offering player for pilgred. Don't even have to kill the merchant, shoot them once and they leave at cycle change - would have prevented the chance that I could have made the deal.</p><p>Killing all the grand inactives is HARD and costly, but it is a choice.</p><p>Ian guarding Jin, works if Jin's not already mush that ship.</p><p>Guarding FC, until the merchant ship is sent away by being shot.</p><p>Not killing all the hunters while we have an offer of Pilgred for a player (thanks again, Roland!).</p><p>This kind of rush is unique to the Comm Officer when mush, but it has a lot of counters, many small details need to fall into place to make it work, and knowing the ingredients and making sure at least one of them is impossible gaurantees this method cannot be used.</p><p>Good luck with the new season!</p>

                <p>Oh hello there, body swap buddy. I started as Jin Su.</p><p>I'd like to add to that saying we wouldn't have felt the need to focus on hunters if Janice had ACTIVATED THE PLASMA SHIELD (which we were pretty close to killing her over, I guess.) This ship seemed so ridiculously uncoordinated. We had plenty of active players, I guess, but so many people didn't seem to be able to do their job. Even if they did though, I'm pretty sure we had our sights on the entirely wrong players as Mush.</p><p>I had considered Eleesha as a possibility, but with no-one building the sofa on the bridge it gave Paola an excuse to not be there at all times. I think it's safe to say I didn't exactly see this one coming. Oh well. GG.</p><p>But hell, I'll take a free third place trophy. I totally deserve that, probably. I am blameless in this debacle. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Yeah, none of you -gave- me the win. The human loss was not any player's fault in my opinion, though Janice could have done better, especially with that shield. I just wanted to point out things I've thought about, and think about still on each of my ships when I am human - I don't care to let that strat be used on me, so I think about how to see it coming and how to try and prevent it. It's like any other pilgred rush strategy, only it requires more 'perfect set up' and less AP to pull it off.</p><p>If the sofa had been built on the bridge, I would have done exactly what I already did, just had more moves available to me when I was ready to put that plan into action since I wouldn't have been wandering regularly between medlab and bridge.</p>

                <p>Oh yeah, no. It's like you pointed out, it was a "perfect setup." It was a series of things that came into play and had one thing been knocked out you wouldn't have been able to do it. It's why I pointed out both Janice AND the lack of Sofa. There was a general lack of action on the ship. We all made plans and never really followed through on them.
