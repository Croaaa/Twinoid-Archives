                <p>Roland here,writing my final worlds after being thrown out by NERON.</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4793" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4793</a></p><p>It all started as a typical ship.When I woke up hunters were down and scraps collected,which created my first impression that we may go far.And I was terribly wrong.</p><p>First instructions were wrote for Janice to change the NERON settings.She made them the exact oppsite,so she was killed soon after.Turns out she was just a griefer,so we continued with a bitter taste and no shrink.</p><p>Next came the semi-inactive captain.At first he seemed a busy,somewhat interested man but when we finally found a planet he first worked without getting us there than turned inactive.He was replaced by Gioele,who was probably the best commander on this ship.He managed to command us well and raise our officiency,but gradually grew frustrated by the increasing number of inactives.</p><p>Then on D6 C4 I was turned to the cause.The mush did nothing to get our attention before it and their numbers didn't seem to increase,so we hoped they were among the many inactives.Apparently they trapped AB2 every day.First Hua was turned,then when I had 2 spores on me Raluca openly finished the conversion in front of the camera.</p><p>By then only 8 people remained(including the 4 mush).Since we were half on half we decided to use the element of surprise and kill the humans.I took 2 of them out with the knife and my allies took care of the rest.And that's my part of the story.</p><p>I hope the others can tell their parts as well,so we don't miss much detail.Cheers!</p>

                <p><strong>Hua</strong> here, I have the same conclusion as what <strong>Roland</strong> had</p><p>The ship started as very active then people started to play the braindead game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>At first I was very suspicious of <strong>Janice</strong> because she slept on a bed for 2 days while going in and out from bravo dorm. then after a day or two of us asking her to set priority to astronavigation and food destruction off.. she finally had the will to change it but, not after she turned off death announcements (<em>I lost 1 morale when <strong>Ian</strong> and <strong>Eleesha</strong> died of hunger without any announcements</em>) and <strong>Chun</strong> found out that she set crewlock to research. we then killed her and we found out that she was just human griefing the ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Then we were seriously getting low on o2 and when frieda found an o2 planet.. <strong>Jin Su</strong> seemed like to delay moving the ship for a day.. when o2 was around 5 :pa: I decided to kill him in order to give <strong>Gioele</strong> the commander role and save us from the impending death due to the lack of O2..</p><p>While <strong>Roland</strong> was taking out hunters, I was mostly doing scraps runs just to have enough metal scraps in case we needed to repair the hull and for the random o2 from space capsules.. little do I know that <strong>Raluca</strong> was actively trapping AB2 and after the expedition I decided to do a scrap run then <em><strong>Poof!</strong></em> I got turned into <strong><em>Mush</em></strong> I quickly took anonymush and collected enough scrap so I can have a reason to claim I ran out of :pa: from scrapping..</p><p>By then the Alphas decided to finish off the humans due to us having a decent amount of crewmembers and the humans slowly losing the will to survive (<em>both from morale and actual people going inactive</em>)) but I saw <strong>Roland</strong> having 1 spore on his person.. I haven't had the chance to test how <em>defacer</em> works so I might as well use this opportunity to learn how I can efficiently use this newly aquired skill.. and with a fumble of only covering half of my actions but acceptable enough to hide the log when I infected <strong>Roland</strong> in front of the camera.. I concluded that the test run was a success and informed the rest of the Mush about it namely <strong>Raluca</strong> and <strong>Frieda</strong>..</p><p>Next time I logged on.. I saw <strong>Raluca</strong> Converting <strong>Roland</strong> and They started killing people without me!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> good thing the Humanity's only hope is still alive when I logged back on.. <strong>Roland</strong> dropped the knife on the dorm I then looked for chun and I saw she has <strong>SNEAAK</strong> good thing I chose to kill her close to a cycle change so I had the chance of finishing the job even if I ran out of :pa:.. I then killed Chun and went back to sleep.. when I woke up all the Mush were assassinated by NERON <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p>
