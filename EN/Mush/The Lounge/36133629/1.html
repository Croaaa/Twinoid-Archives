                <p>Hi crew!</p><p>I was trapped as JinSu! My plan from the start was to play the Captain as an overthetop, camp, ruler of the ship. Turns out I don't have it in me and I was playing with the idea of pretending to be someone else (female) on the ship, then realised that it's not only confusing, but also, depending on the person, stifling them in their choice of character. So I went for the idea of being stuck in the wrong body, never been Commander before (which is true, I have yet to play Chao, Gioele, Stephen also) and obsessed with Red.</p><p>On my ships I usually speak about some activity taking me away from my duties rather than going AFK/sleep/etc so tea parties galore! I hope I didn't creep you out Roland!! We had a good core team, but stifled by no projects to assist the progress and the ever breaking of connection to SOL, was it three days at the end without? We should have kept the microwave oven!!</p><p>I feel sad for the people getting knocked off by Gioele and so frustrated at Terrence for not communicating his health issues and leaving us without a technician and the wrench, but overall we did well. With all the food we had, if we only had had those mage books we would have gotten further, day ten and the serum at least!</p><p>See you all around the next Sun!</p>

                <p>All right! Finally gonna write something up about this ship.<br>After I woke up, I looked through the logs to see what was going on, only to notice something: Chun had only spoken in Belarusian before going inactive in a storage room. From. The start we were already doomed, research wise. As Raluca, I quickly retreated to the rear of the ship with the cat, working on Pilgred, until Finola's murder. Upon asking why they did that, Chao explained that he had been asked to torture her due to odd activity, revealing that she had spored twice. After her death, things continued as normal until Gioele killed Stephen for bring dirty. Of course, he was human. We told him not to do it again, assuming it was a noob mistake, until he killed Kuan Ti. He was killed himself shortly afterward, giving Janice paranoia, and resulting in shennanigans later involving jokes about it being contagious. Later, as Janice was allowing me to sleep in a dorm to build up points for research (Jin Su had told me to get some work done as nobody else was) , the remaining Mush icon in the crew bar vanished just as Ian stopped being inactive. He was killed shortly after for not knowing how to use Anonymush.<br>Later, we had completed Pilgred, and our ship was down to 10 Armor. We had no more scrap, no plasma shield, and no mage books that would help. We returned without the serum or humanity's last hope, although no mush were alive.</p>

                <p>That was pretty much the story. I felt bad for pushing you into research but liked that it would give me a chance to cross you off my list. Raluca's are always suspicious! But I knew that I just wanted to have you proved human. Eleesha was an efficient mush hunter and although we had questions for Stephen and KuanTi about their dirtiness they acted very much as the naive beginners they also were. Gioele was just on a rampage without any communication and it's a shame he got two human's down before we got rid of him. The most frustrating thing was SOL constantly disconnecting and no luck in reestablish while we were running wild trying to repair and find fires. I liked how we tried to get it all together until the end, but without mage books or ghost Chun we couldn't get enough work on the serum, even with the extra coffee! Maybe next time we'll actually be a little more successful.</p>
