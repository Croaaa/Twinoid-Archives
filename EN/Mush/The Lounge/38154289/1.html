                <p>Hi, this ship is the weirdest one and still hasn't ended formally, but for all intents and purposes ~ it's done.</p><p>I was starting a new ship and saw Andie. Naturally, I grabbed him. To my delight, Frieda had already found us a good planet. Jin Su seemed active. The others were quiet but I thought we might have a chance to make it to SOL.</p><p>Unfortunately, on Day 2, it turned out that Jin Su and I were both Mush. Jin was more experienced, so he took leadership of the Mush collective. We turned Raluca on D3 but it turned out that she was inactive after the advancing PILGRED once.</p><p>The days were darn boring but we had fun watching the humans kill each other in various ways.</p><p>1. Gioele and Derek<br>On D2, Gioele grabbed the Hacker Kit and knife early one and refused to communicate. He then assassinated Derek at the Front Alpha Turret for no good reason. I managed to find this out and announced this ship~wide. After 4 unsuccessful blaster shots, I slinked away in shame, only to find that Terrence had killed him. Thanks, bro!</p><p>2. Frieda and Kuan Ti<br>At end of D2 thereabouts, we had arrived at the planet scanned earlier. Unfortunately, no one wanted to go on an expo. The actives one included me and Jin Su and we were planning to ditch them on an expo. In the end Frieda and Kuan Ti decided to do a crazy dangerous expo on their own. The amazing thing is they survived and brought back 10 fuel and 5 steaks. Unfortunately, Jin was holding the medkit and Frieda died of injuries later on.</p><p>Kuan Ti was unfortunate enough to be at the Nexus and it broke down immediately after and was announced by NERON. Eleesha suddenly became active and was hell bent on killing poor Kuan Ti despite protests by Jin Su. Kuan died and another 2 actives gone.</p><p>3. The killing of Jin Su<br>After this, it was becoming clear that Jin was the Mush after Eleesha found him hiding the medkit at the med lab. What wasn't clear was that the sneaky tag team of Eleesha and Paola were planning to murder him. This happened whilst MT servers was laggy. When I came back, I saw that Eleesha and Paola had tag-teamed to kill Jin and take his two blasters, sigh.</p><p>4. The Mush strikes back<br>The killing of my bro and leader made me see RED! I quickly went and infected Roland, the noob that was in Front Corridor. Then I rushed back and used the knife to slash Eleesha in Bravo Dorm. Despite my best efforts, she was still alive. I then went back and transferred into Roland. With a full MP bar and 8AP, I was able to kill Eleesha. Next was Paola in Alpha Dorm. She dies soon after 6 blasters hit via Shooter and 2 slashes of the knife. Turns out she was wearing armor.</p><p>5. Terrence, the SOLE active survivor<br>Terrence was sleeping peacefully, oblivious to it all. Once the cycle changed, he was up next. 4 slashes of the knife and he was gone.</p><p>6. Depression kills<br>Before I knew it, a chain depression set in killing all humans. There's just left Roland, in my (Andie) body, Raluca and myself.</p><p>***<br>So, I am on the Daedalus with 24 fuel, 25 O2 and 37 armor. Still happily piloting away, so long as Roland in my body is alive. Any fun ideas on what to do next? Thinking of piloting the ship as long as I can until the MMM6 hits.<br><br>Adios!</p>
