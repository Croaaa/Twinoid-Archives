                <p>Finally, on my 18th <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/5125">ship</a>, I and the other remaining nine crew-members make it to Eden</p><p>I wasn't intending to go as Chun until my Gold days had ran out, since there isn't much point in having more than her first two skills. However, she came up on my first full round of choices for the MMM so I took the plunge early; didn't regret it for a second. Of course, many of you will have seen this ship discussed quite a bit in the <a target="_self" href="/tid/forum#!view/104909|thread/36393163?p=50">MMM thread</a> already, but here's some more detail...</p><p>As mentioned, this was an MMM ship, and fortunately D1C1 rather than D2. I think it filled up only a cycle later, with Gioele and Raluca chosen as Alpha Mush; the latter immediately extracting a spore which ended up being the only one of the entire game. Derek and Eleesha were inactive after their first cycle and Hua only logged in twice the entire ship. My main worry at the start was having no Technician, but fortunately Raluca was Level 3 Gold and Kuan Ti took it later in the day. Other than that, we had a good mix of skills to cover all tasks. The only Mage Book to be used was our initial Botanist one for me, allowing Ian to take Green Thumb instead.</p><p>Research was very speedy with a Polyvalent Andie and Biologist Ian, Raluca quickly working out that she would have no opportunity to do anything with the MycoAlarm placement and extra Cameras. The only topics we didn't manage were Natamy Rifle and Mushicide Soap (after a fire) - that would have gotten me to top Glory position! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>Projects also went without a hitch; Plasma Shield came up in the first round and we always had something useful as an option.</p><p>My jobs were standard Chun fare, relaying Research, taking care of the plants - this was no small task with a full ten-pot Garden for a few days - and leading the Mush investigation without an Eleesha. The Solid 'bug' helped out initially, giving me my first human in Stephen and bringing suspicion on Gioele (as well as keeping him pacified after lugging the Microwave all the way to Icarus Bay). Despite Kuan Ti's grand claims of single-handedly doing lots of things, the actual human chat had already formed that opinion and was about to make a move on Gioele. Before we could do this though, he went to the Bridge, the restricted Front Turret that Hua was idling in, then promptly killed himself in the shower. We were worried he had Jellied some Terminals, spiked Hua or done... anything, but it turns out all he'd done is build a Grenade. Maybe that caused the accident that killed him before Transfer, but either way it wasn't very effective.<br>In the next few days there were many people double-eating for morale, Comms/Astro AP, by accident, or in Terrence's case just for the hell of it I guess. Once Derek starved, the only non-confirmed humans were Andie, Kuan Ti and Raluca. We decided to eventually use the Cure on Raluca, and if we were wrong we'd kill Andie. However, Kuan Ti made some further mistakes that have already been discussed elsewhere, leading to his death, and within a few cycles we had cured our second Mush. The crew had a good laugh about his later PMs to me.<br>My later conversation with Raluca revealed that we had nothing much to worry about from them given our active human team; the only real enemy was Oxygen. Admittedly Gioele's Grenade did consume one Oxygen which would have put us at 0 just before the plants would have given us long enough. Fortunately a Space Capsule gave us that extra window, although we got 8 from our first safe Oxygen planet in about fifteen and the plants gave us a daily surplus from then on.</p><p>With the Mush hunt out of the way, we geared up to search for our remaining two Starmap Fragments (the first was from an earlier planet, I think the one that claimed Roland). I gave Andie two MTPasses for them to go up to Level 5, and Stephen had Apprenticed Pilot earlier to make up for Roland and Hua not being able to support Jin Su. We had an Astrophysicist book for Paola, a Babel Module blueprint from Xyloph and were ready for the long haul. This took us one expedition: Intelligent Life and Shipwreck yielded a Fragment each, we didn't even need to go to the Cristalite zone.</p><p>We were well equipped to push on to Day 15 or perhaps even 20, but given we had almost nothing to do in the middle of Day 8, we just earned our Casting Tickets and went home before anyone died of steel plates or boredom. Hopefully we get to hold onto that record for a while, but it was an enjoyable expedition nonetheless. Thanks to all of the surviving ten, hope to hear from you here if I've left anything to say!</p>

                <p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> Hi, Lai Kuan Ti there.</p><p>It was the time to start MMM. I still saw the 3 remaining characters: Frieda, Hua, Jin Su. I was waiting until they disappear. When they disappeared, I quickly picked Kuan Ti and started this voyage. I didn't have much time, and in 10 minutes I managed to install the camera in the Bravo Dorm and went sleep. After these 10 minutes there were 4 people. It was night, but as I couldn't sleep in real time, sometimes I was checking how many people came. In 1 hour, there were at least half of crew.</p><p>As a bronze character, I could choose just 1 skill. I had 3lvl and enough experience to level-up. "Astrophysicist or Technician?" - I asked myself. There were 1 astrophysicist Frieda with IT Expert skill, and 1 technician Raluca as 3lvl gold character. I found an answer on D1C7, when I noticed there's no shower dismantled. I got angry at Raluca, who, of course, was active after Mush selection, and she hadn't visited Bravo Dorm. Also, Plasma Shield was at low percent (~10%), Raluca participated just once. I picked Technician, having hope that Frieda will find oxygen planet. 1 attempt - shower dismantled. Also helped with Plasma Shield a few times.</p><p>Later, I noticed Raluca finished the Plasma Shield up (from about ~50%). Gravity Simulator was broken and Stephen forced me to get the wrench and repair this thing. I took the wrench and went to the Laboratory. 4 attempts to repair Gravity Simulator. I thought someone used Green Jelly, it was day 2 when that happened. I was checking logs... Janice, Andie, Ian... probably carrying on research. What else? Stephen kicked Eleesha out, Chun was there and... <strong>Gioele!</strong> What was the reason that he came there? Just once accessed the Research Lab. Maybe he did something, but just once.</p><p>It hadn't been day 3, when I made a private channel and invited Chun and Stephen and told my suspects about Gioele and Raluca with the reasons mentioned above. I noticed the Plasma Shield was already done by Raluca, I told them the reason was one: she noticed she isn't the only technician and to make less suspicion, finished the Plasma Shield. Stephen told about suspiction on Terrence, who abused his Robotics Expert skill to upgrade the drones, making building the Sofa impossible.</p><p>Later, Gioele went washed to his death, but Chun didn't trust me, because she thought I was sneaky accusing Gioele who couldn't pretend to be human with Solid skill. I made many projects, I helped to discover Raluca as Mush, once I visited her room because I believed Mycoscan will show everything and there aren't anonymous infects. Twice I repaired PILGRED altrough Jin Su prevented us from it (I noticed it after repairing). I thought PILGRED is booby-trapped, I knew I hadn't had any chance to get infected because I always worked under cameras. After repairng PILGRED, I went through the Rear Corridor, where Stephen dropped a Standard Ration and Raluca visited there. I took this ration and went to the Lab. I checked my body: no spores. Ate the ration and checked: no spores. Hmmmm... I felt helpless.<strong> I noticed Ian has double-eaten</strong>, I invited him to the private channel, but he wasn't talking. I was sad that people was doing food-tests. While I was returning to dorm, I did the thing with Chun.</p><p>There was <strong>lack of oxygen</strong>, Frieda hadn't found the oxygen planet, but she told us every planet she found. We'd already visited 2 non-oxygen planets for some fruit. It was day 5, when I saved some PAs for scanning. Hua suddenly wake up from her inactivity and went scanning. She scanned 2 planets, 3 analyzis, she ate a ration and got dirty, but she got showered. She must have used at least 13 PAs. With SC researched I worked out that she isn't Mush, unless she extracted a spore in the beginning, but she wasn't dirty, otherwise she wasn't analyzing these planets. Maybe she had 2 skills: Phagocyte and Fertile, but for inactive player such as her, I don't think it's even possible. Terrence found an oxygen planet, size 16, still unknown zones. 5 fuel, East. I put the fuel into combiuston chamber and got dirty. I was scared that the Mush could suffocate us, so I didn't admit to be dirty, but went to the Alpha Dorm and used the Soap. I hoped Janice won't be more active than our commander and won't reveal anything. Then Terrence found 2 sectors with seismic activities (earthquakes, as he said). I had full PA, so I was going to scanning. I went to the Refectory, but it was broken. I repairing, but after I noticed there's a Standard Ration left by Janice in the Central Corridor. I got dirty repairing the door, so got showered, and went to the Laboratory, where's Mycoscan (to check if this ration is spored) and the Apron. Eating, I noticed the Standard Ration hadn't been spored. <strong>I also noticed Frieda and Janice had double-eaten.</strong> Went scanning. 2 attempts and planet found. 7 sector - smaller, but it was perfect for me. 3 attempt to analyze and <strong>Jackpot!</strong> Oxygen planet found, and crystalite zone. East, 4. I told the crew that I found safer oxygen planet, and 1 unknown zone, anyway it'll be for sure better than 2 earthquakes. I admited to put the fuel into Combustion Chamber, got dirty by loading fuel and after by repairing the door, and ordered to remove 1 fuel from the combiustion chamber, and jump.</p><p>When I was offline, I was afraid that the Mush may have not removed this fuel and tell us it was done. <strong>Raluca told us she removed the fuel</strong> and we got this planet. I was surprised that she may suffocate us, however she helped us to get the oxygen planet. We got first Starmap Fragment. I told Chun I was confused. Everybody was attempting to get oxygen, and the Mush amongst them. She told me that I'm still not confirmed human, but the actions which I had done cause that I lived longer. I repaired PILGRED third time (because most of projects done, and I didn't know how to use my technician skill in other case), but didn't notice Chun prohibited it. I admited to get dirty while I was reparing PILGRED. I took the medikit to check if Raluca got hurted. It was D6C4 and I knew she had eaten recently on D3C5. I healed her to full health and I wanted to check if she would forget to eat and get starving. While I was trying to force her to answer for the question if she thought I was Mush, Stephen killed me. She thought I've self-healed with the Medikit, if I didn't hold it and I left the Alpha Dorm once and returned once, but the Medikit was still in the Rear Corridor. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><span class="tid_wspoil">Maybe I was conceited and looked down for the crew, and it killed me. But killing me because I wasn't confirmed human, even if I did many projects, rescued crew from asphyxia and suspected the right Mush? She thought I might have been Mush! I learned that refusing food-test should be always required before Mush selection. Frieda, Janice, Ian and Terrence subjected food-testing. When I and Janice were working on Automatic Sprinklers, she brought a coffee and standard ration, but I refused, because I didn't want to trick the game and Chun should have trusted me jugding by my procedure, not by food-test, Solid skill or what else the Mush couldn't do because of game mechanics. She also wanted to kill Andie, altrough she made many research, which made the game for Gioele more difficult. I think she was the best crewmate there, because she didn't subject food-test and was awesome. Raluca had many opportunities to destroy the crew. The first thing - she might have suffocate the crew, but she put the right amount of fuel to visit my planet. When I got killed, she might go rampage as the only technician which crew needed. I think she played worse than Gioele, she waited politely for the RFS, betrayed the Mush team. Stephen played also well, altrough he killed me, but it was Chun's order.</span></p>

I think, it wasn't about refusing food-test (which wasn't announced by you in general chat iirc), it was about you a) working pilgred <strong>three times</strong> when everybody said "don't"; b) visiting Raluca in the turret. All that without discussion. Maybe c) trying too hard to make youself look good, but that's subjectively.</p>

                <p>Nobody actively refused a food test test from me because I didn't force it on anyone. Every time someone requested the use of that half-day's Coffee, or needed Morale from fruit, I always made it sound jokey and was clear that they didn't have to if they didn't want to. The only time I was really trying it was Raluca with that Guntiflop, especially since its initial effects were too long for the "causes Food Poisoning" to come up on AstroPad; forgot that Mush can see the effects anyway. Janice never mentioned that you avoided one, so it was her own initiative rather than "Chun's orders".</p><p>pimpernel has probably got it covered with c). You wanted to be part of the investigation so were checking a lot of things to seem trustworthy, but they all brought suspicion on you instead. You might also want to reconsider the difference between "not the way I would do it" and "against the rules" in relation to what some people were up to.<br>"Oh I got Dirty working on PILGRED" and "just popping in to see Raluca" are both pretty common Mush tactics for sporing and spiking. Even if you weren't Mush, missing the "don't work on PILGRED" notice three times, despite you posting in the PILGRED Thread where those orders were given each time could have easily led to a sneaky Sol return by Raluca. As for the Medikit conclusion, I told you via PM that all the logs of picking it up, showering and wandering around were all "1h ago" so I couldn't tell which order they were without Tracker.</p><p>Gioele literally did nothing Mushy - no spores extracted, no Green Jellying (the Grav Sim broke on its own), not even "built the Grenade" is in his list of actions which is weird. Would have been killed for doing nothing useful as much as some suspicion for following Stephen around, no Solid etc.<br>Terrence was pretty suspicious since he didn't do an awful lot at the start other than upgrade his Drones which meant he had a lot of AP that we didn't see used and he was Dirty a few times. He was good at healing people at the end though.<br>Andie and Raluca hadn't done anything particularly Mushy (not immediately throwing all AP into the Plasma Shield wasn't enough to go on, she might have genuinely had connection issues since Twinoid was also a bit weird for me at that time), but it was a matter of being the only people not in the human chat. Since Andie did almost half the work on the Cure when they asked what to do, seemed we chose correctly on who to Innoculate first.</p>

                <p>But I always investigate when I predict this ship to be a defeat. Reason: one astrophysicist, one technician, a few pilots. And this lack of oxygen. But when I found an oxygen planet and told you, maybe it was a mistake and I could have been quiet and waited for developments, because telling you about the oxygen planet might have outweighed scarves. And after that all, while I was useless, you may have killed me with no consequences. Not for Raluca, who became the only technician back. I was too good, but I should have sticked to common sense - not too bad, not too good. In this ship where's the Mush amongst them, all the time I should be needed, to survive.</p>

                <p>Alpha mush Raluca here.</p><p>Gioele and I were selected as mush. I managed to create a spore shortly after mush selection and then went to wait in my turret for a while to see what kind of crew we were going to have. Unfortunately for us mushy types, it seemed it was going to be a highly active and competent crew. And to make it worse, Plasma shield comes up in our first round of Neron projects. Guess who has Physicist and Technician and is expected to work on it? And even worse yet, we had already gotten 2 extra cameras from Gioele's paranoid skill and the crew rapidly got mycoalarms done. Which made creating spores without being noticed a virtual impossibility. I decided to hold on to my one spore for a possible transfer later on since it was probably the only spore I was going to be able to make.</p><p>Kuan Ti had taken technician while I was offline so if I didn't work on it they would have gotten the shield anyway and probably killed me just for not working on it. Nothing was breaking and we were told by Jin Su not to work on Pilgred, so I had nothing else to spend my AP on but the nexus.</p><p>There were a couple inactives on board, so I suggested to Gioele that we lay low for a while and hope suspicion fell on them. I was hoping that would buy us some time. I had a couple plans, but we needed to wait to see what magebooks we got from Xyloph and also for Stephen to use his apprentice skill. Unfortunately, Gioele managed to kill himself before any of that happened. I still have no idea what he was doing. I hadn't heard from him for several cycles and the next time I logged in, he was dead.</p><p>So here I am on a highly active ship with no partner. A rampage would have done little to no good, so I decided to masquerade as human for as long as I could hoping that an opportunity would come along where I could sabotage the ship at a critical time.</p><p>Finally it happens! We are low on O2. Chun is taking great care of the garden, but if I can sabotage one or both of the O2 tanks, 1 or 2 of the crew might die before gaining O2 from day change. With a little luck, it will be critical members. The crew finds an O2 planet. They haven't fully scanned it yet, but the O2 is low so they load fuel and decide to jump. I secretly unload a fuel and hold it. I'm hoping they will jump to empty space and find themselves unable to find another O2 planet in time to prevent more asphyxiation deaths. Victory is a possibility. Then.....disaster. They finish scanning the planet and find death zones. They decide not to go. They find another suitable planet, so I "pretend" to unload the appropriate amount of fuel before anyone else comes to do it and discovers my attempted sabotage. I continue to wait and maintain the illusion of humanity as best I can.</p><p>To try to keep up appearances, I try to eat every few days. I can't find any rations, so I ask Chun which fruit is safe to eat. She tries to get me to eat one that will make me sick. Now I know they are on to me and I'm sure Chun knows I know it. I'm doomed. I decide to wait until I have more AP then rampage/transfer/rampage more.</p><p>Next thing I know, the crew kills Kuan Ti for repeatedly doing things he isn't supposed to. A new opportunity: I'm the only tech, there are no tech magebooks, Stephen has already apprenticed pilot and Pilgred is only at 40-something percent. All I need to do now is go "inactive" and it'll take them a TON of AP to finish Pilgred.</p><p>I log in a couple cycles later and to my surprise, I have the "you are no longer mush" message. I didn't know they were even working on the serum. I was even in the lab and can't believe I forgot to check. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>This is getting wordier than I planned, so I'll wrap up by saying that Chun explained that at the end, the list of suspects was down to 3. They made an educated guess as to who got the serum and they happened to guess right. I hope no one thinks I was playing against my (mush) team. I actually was trying WIN, not just go on an early rampage that would haven't been much more than an inconvenience that resulted in my rapid execution.</p><p>It was definitely a challenge. Thanks for a great ship everyone! It's ships like this that keep me coming back for more.</p>

                <p>Kuan Ti definitely thought you were playing against your team there, but I suppose with the change in fuel for the second planet it was a bit more difficult - although you could have reloaded the chamber and had us miss it that way. Another opportunity would have been for you to claim that Kuan Ti had spored you when he first went into your turret, then "oh it must have been a trap" when we found out he was a dead human. If it makes you feel better, your pretence at eating was one of the final actions that got Kuan Ti killed anyway.</p><p>I think you could have got a few spores out, particularly in the early days where you weren't up to much and Constipaspore was yet to be finished. We couldn't have hidden an alarm in your turret so you were safe there, although you would have been hard-pressed to use them on anyone but Hua since you only knew about the "obvious" ones in Nexus and Engine Room where you would mostly target. AB2 is usually a good Trap spot, but I had decided to cover Schroedinger, pills and food by putting our last alarms in the Refectory and Medlab.</p><p>I'm glad we managed to get you to our side in the end, even if there wasn't much for you to fix and the second Sofa didn't get much use. I'm sure you would have had lots to do if we pushed on further!</p>

This wasn't a call made by one person, we were all generally suspicious of your play and decided that either you were MUSH or you were a liability who couldn't be trusted to follow basic instructions. Don't work on Pilgred. Don't go to Raluca's turret. Stop getting dirty for minimal benefit.</p><p>This had nothing to do with emotions, your death was directly attributable to poor play on your part.
