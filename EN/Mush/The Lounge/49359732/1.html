I still watch on you, by te way.</strong><br>Humans was lucky, RNG play against mushes and this was compounded with errors. Anyway, it was good and funny game, real thriller with lot of fun. Thank you alll. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>First of all, I even don`t want play as a mush. I have good mush game before, we going to Sol with 6 alive mushes. I was tired from hardcore play after that. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>So I choose Raluca with target to play not act so much with people, like antisocial. <br>I grab Mad Cube, going to ER, twice repair Pilgred, go to turret and solve Mad Cube for awoid transfer into me and rush Pilgred. (and it was my fault).<br>But RNG decide to be me and Ian mushes (And I was without PA). And this was little disappointing.</p><p>Ian was mycologist, and didnt answer for questions 12 h. And after that he say me, what he dont want play hard and cannot be online in C1. And this was really bad. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>First target for convert was Stephen, than it should be transfer to Terrence (not Roland) in C8. And second spike in C1. But time was lost and Terrence get up and out.</p><p>When I out from turret, I load 1 fuel for miss planet, I want transfer to kill old body, but RNG play against me. 4 failed attempt to broke oxygen tank... So bad... I`m out of :pa: because this and cannot wash to decrease HP. So Janice take Raluca`s body in perfect condition and with oxygen capsules. It was my fault... <br>And after that - drone come and repair tank!!! RNG again play against mushes again. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Ok, we have to plane cast 2 casefire in a row, so it should be end in C2. We should have new spores and spikes and we should have new 2 mushes in D5. But Ian/Roland say again, he cannot be online in C1 or C2. Oook.</p><p>And you find planet with oxygen. If Roland has been online - he can go to expo and crash Icarus. But he didnt was online. So I need to go in Nexus, switch Pilot lock and go to Icarus for launch expo. So Terrence come with me. <br>And with traitor and so many dangerous zones only 5 damage to Terrence, and I pump oxygen? RNG again play against mushes.</p><p>Roland became active, when all was done. I calculate explored zones, it was 10 (with MIA), and planet was only with 9 zones. So think only MIA zone has remain. Trying to launch expo with 10 sec, but lost good time because glitch of TWINOID, and human load fuel. So second attempt of rescue became tragic for mushes and win for humans.</p><p><em>Congratulate for you, humans, and thank all active players. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></em><br>Especially for you, <em>Raluca</em> and Stephen. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Yours sincerely, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/raluca_tomescu.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RT:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/janice_kent.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JK:" class="tid_ico">, <em>Janice</em>.</p>

                <p>And thread reopened. It turns out that the ship lasted much longer than you expected, Hua, since we just went back to Sol : <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8554" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8554</a> .</p><p>Stephen here, proud <span class="tid_strike">human</span> <span class="tid_strike">mush</span> human commander of an amazing crew. This was probably one of the most exciting ship I have had in a long time. Human until D3C8, I got double-spiked and converted under Defacer by mush Ian. He was actually the main suspect at the time due to his inactivity (despite being Gold and high level), but we hadn't had time to kill him yet. Raluca, the other alpha, was also suspected since she never left her turret, but again we hadn't acted on our suspicions, too busy with getting the first anti-mush research and killing inactive Jin Su, who was a liability.</p><p>So here I was, newly converted with two active partners, and with an active human crew who raised the alarm straight away. Ian transferred to inactive Roland (whose last words are so pathetic that I almost died laughing when I read them) and took off in the Pasiphae with three oxygen capsules. Humans immediately started to rush projects, and a few cycles later Paola tried to do a Neron <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/1/1/c9912284_516.jpg">upgrade</a> and immediately got Magnetic Net. Soon after that, Eleesha found a planet with oxygen. The mush cursed the RNG, and tried to think of a plan. The best idea would have been to bring Roland back into the ship at the last minute, move to the planet, and let him steal the Icarus. But instead, we decided to lose the planet, steal the remaining oxygen, have Raluca transfer to Janice and sabotage O2. So be it.</p><p>It would have been a great plan anyway, except that... Raluca apparently sabotaged an oxygen tank and a <strong>fuel</strong> tank, and stole capsules <strong>before</strong> transferring. I moved the ship, then Roland and I rushed to BD protected by new Janice's ceasefire, but I only had one capsule and Janice had none. Worse, Raluca was still alive and holding capsules, and it took much longer than expected for our O2 to reach zero.</p><p>We snuggled in our beds for a few cycles, trying to plan our next move, while humans were plotting actively and everyone exchanged various <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/c/3/3d8795f5_516.jpg">threats</a>. We suddenly noticed that someone had loaded fuel, and guessed that they had found another oxygen planet (that was to be expected...). This time, we couldn't let them get away with it. Janice sneaked out of BD to steal the last oxygen capsules, while I declared another ceasefire, having apprenticed Diplomat. At cycle change, Hua died of asphyxiation. Janice showered, rushed out of BD again, unlocked piloting, and ran to Icarus Bay. Unfortunately, Terrence had time to join her and they both went to the planet. Janice got lost, Terrence got injured, then he got oxygen and found Janice... who was lost again when the Icarus came back. Roland and Terrence played cat and mouse, and eventually Roland managed to kill Terrence. Then, despite me telling him that someone had already loaded fuel to abandon Janice, he went back to IB and launched the Icarus again. Sure enough, humans had hacked again within minutes, and both Janice and Roland were dead.</p><p>That's when I started to feel juuuust a little uncomfortable. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I had no weapons, almost no AP, no shooting points, no spores. I knew that if I left BD, I would be killed immediately, and that when ceasefire ended at day change, they would all pounce on me. I couldn't kill, convert or transfer, and I couldn't even fly away since they had Magnetic Net. Raluca was <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/8/c/92e9c54d_516.jpg">screaming</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/b/0/904956f1_516.jpg">blue murder</a> at me, and Derek and Chun were sleeping next to me, armed to the teeth. So I stayed in bed, clutching the teddy bear and hoping that I would run fast enough to act before getting killed. But when I came back before day change, it was only to discover that Raluca had geniused the cure... and I was human again.</p><p>I must admit that it was one of the most unsettling situations, and I was feeling as <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/d/f/4557a59a_516.jpg">confused</a> in real life as poor Stephen. Human mush hunter, then mush plotting against his ex human allies, then human again, forced to deal with the consequences of his actions, having lost humans and mush partners... All within less than eight cycles. An intense day indeed...</p><p>After that, things settled down, despite our difficult situation. We had lost all pilots but one, our shrink, two techs, as well as the Icarus. We did have one pilot left and a pilot magebook, though, and of course Raluca was a tech. Expos were all the more difficult as Andie got lost on his first solo expo, and by the time I was ready to rescue him (after facing a shipwreck combat, ouch), he died of depression. But we never gave up, and managed to finish Pilgred, keep the crew alive, and even do a few expos before going back to Sol on D11.</p><p>Once again, <strong>thanks a lot</strong> to everyone, on both sides. Roland and Janice, I had great fun during that mushy day. Hua, Terrence, Andie, you gave your life to save <span class="tid_strike">them</span> us. Frieda, I am sorry that you died so early. And everyone else, Derek, Chun, Kuan Ti, Eleesha, Paola (I loved RPing with you), and of course my Raluca ♥, you were all amazing.</p><br><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Soroosh, let me know if you want me to retrieve your original message, or if you want to write a new one.</span></p>

                <p>We're back <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> The ship just returned to Sol Day 11, Cycle 1: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8554." target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8554.</a> There's a few more details I can add from the human side, but Janice covered most of it.</p><p>First few days were pretty quiet. We had an inactive Gioele (whose death was very traumatic to poor Paola, but she bravely suffered through it!) and a mute Jin who Stephen and Derek got rid of; but everyone else was at least semi-active. Roland, Ian, and Raluca were all quiet, and Frieda took a while to join in but she did start to work eventually. For a long time, there wasn't much being said about the Mush; some (Stephen mainly) were suspicious of Ian for not helping out a lot despite being Gold, but there were no solid leads. I was active and consistent on Comms, while Projects and Research were moving at an okay pace. The only matter of concern was our dwindling reserves of Oxygen.<br> And then it happened. Bravo Dorm was defaced, Ian was murdered, and Roland had run off in the Pasiphae! Terrence, Stephen, and Roland had all been in the dorm when it happened. Stephen, with Kuan Ti vouching for him, reported that Ian had moved to the front of the ship, come back to BD, and defaced the dorm. Stephen claimed that once he saw Defacer, he started attacking Ian and he didn't notice when he transferred into Roland and ran away. Terrence fled the room as soon as saw the defacing too, which made things a real headache. Terrence and Stephen were both online, they both offered the same telling of what happened, with the conclusion that both of them were human. <br> I thought that they were <strong>both</strong> Mush, thinking Terrence and Roland/Ian had coordinated to convert Stephen. One important piece of information arrived right before the Defacer incident: I unlocked Finola's List from Xyloph, and it proved that me, Hua, Eleesha, and Kuan Ti were human. Oh, and one more person...Stephen! Since I knew that Stephen wasn't an Alpha, I was convinced he was converted during that attack. I didn't believe he had killed Ian by accident, and couldn't accept that no one had been converted. But there was no proof. Eleesha tried to help out by checking logs, but she would only post disconnect snippets, and some of her deductive info contradicted what we knew really happened. She provided more confusion than answers, honestly. We concentrated on getting rid of the Mush we <em>were</em> sure about, and on addressing our bigger problem, Oxygen. Eleesha helped out by finding our first O2 planet, and Terrence, Hua and Kuan Ti began to rush projects in a search for Magnetic Net, completing Plasma Shield in the process. At the end of the night, once they had failed to reach it, I tried a NERON upgrade and BAM! Magnetic Net. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"><br> So we had a planet, the net to retrieve the Pasiphae, everyone knowing that Roland needs to die...it seemed like things were looking up! Of course, we still had a compromised Commander, and I was a bit worried when we still hadn't moved or had fuel loaded when I logged off for the night. But it wasn't like calling Stephen out on it would've helped anything. When I returned in the morning, the planet had been missed, and Roland was safely under a ceasefire called by Janice (originally Raluca) along with Stephen in Bravo Dorm. One of <em>those</em> mornings.<br> Thankfully, the human team <strong>really</strong> pulled together here, and things could have been a lot trickier if even one of them hadn't shown up. Eleesha and Derek were ready to kill Janice once the ceasefire was up, but they mistimed it and Eleesha had to log off with one more cycle of peace remaining. Next to show up was Hua, who managed to find us <em>another</em> O2 planet, and then got ready to launch an expedition to retrieve it. We had 2 O2 left, so if we could get to the planet next cycle, no one would die. Hua and I loaded the fuel, Chun used the Hacker Kit, and we were on our way! I moved to FC to guard, though I was a little too fast for Chun and she got stuck in FC. But that helped us, since it created the illusion that there were 2 guards to stop our Mushy Commander from ruining our expedition. Unfortunately, Janice moved out of BD to grab two more units of Oxygen; Derek was unable to catch her, and now we had <strong>0</strong> going into the next cycle. Who died? Spoiler is in the thread title. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br> By now, everyone was on the same page about who could and couldn't be trusted. Before she died, Hua had contacted Terrence, Andie, Frieda, and Derek. Terrence stepped up to lead the expedition in Hua's place, moving quickly after he noticed that Janice was showering to lower her HP. There wasn't really any doubt at this point, but he confirmed that Stephen was Mush by reporting that he had copied Diplomat from Janice. Terrence and Janice became our unlikely rescue team; they found O2 on the very first zone, but Terrence had only 9 HP at launch. Janice had 3 HP, but she got lost on the very next zone. It was a really tense hour for the humans as we watched Terrence navigate a planet alone, through 3 undiscovered zones, with just over half a bar of HP. But it wasn't all bad; thanks to the ceasefires, Humans and Mush had nearly a day to fling threats and openly tease the other side.</p><p>The Death Threat KT organized after things broke down in the Planet thread: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ViXxBJl.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/ViXxBJl.png</a><br>Stephen was not happy about us moving the ship without him: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/sL1FDj9.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/sL1FDj9.png</a><br>Expedition Chat: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5M7GRXo.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/5M7GRXo.png</a></p><p>Finally, Terrence came back without Janice. I ran to IB to kill her since he had found her earlier, but since she got lost <em>again</em> on the last zone, my job became to save Terrence instead. Except, Roland was waiting for him too; he got Terrence down to 1 HP before he escaped into Bravo Dorm, where Stephen had used his Apprentice skill to copy Diplomat and call a second ceasefire. I headed to BD and prepared to escort Terrence to the medlab to heal him, since Janice had hidden the medikit. Roland didn't say much, but he was more active than we anticipated; as soon as Terrence left BD, he followed him. He was able to kill him before I even arrived. That was a big mistake on my part, since I should have already been in BB waiting for Terrence in the first place. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> It's not like I delayed more than a few seconds after Terrence moved either; Roland was fast, and I just didn't even think that he was waiting to attack Terrence again. Sorry Terrence!</p><p>At this point, I asked Derek to load the fuel so we could leave orbit. Roland surprised everyone by launching an expedition right after the fuel was loaded. This made us pause; Derek didn't want to lose the Icarus, but I insisted that Roland bringing Janice back on to the ship would be <em>much</em> worse. Luckily Frieda came back online, and I convinced her to hack us out of orbit. Finally, six cycles after the defacing, we had our first dead Mush, two of them no less! At this point, we still didn't know if Raluca had Genius, so the plan was to rush Mushovore to stop Stephen from converting anyone (we had no idea he was hurting for AP), and for Derek to finish him off once the ceasefire ended. But then, Raluca returned and revealed her trump card, she was a Genius! Janice had locked Research so that she could try and sabotage the expedition, so I had to grab the Hacker Kit and change the BIOS myself (Eleesha was afk). I failed, but Andie came through with the ration I needed to finish the job, Raluca completed the serum and then the battle was over.</p><p>Mush, you played really well! Keeping Raluca alive turned out to be your undoing, but even that wouldn't have cost you if the humans hadn't worked together so well. In a refreshing change from games that have only a handful of major players, every single surviving human contributed in some significant way to fighting back against you. Well done, everyone, human and Mush alike. <br> Oh, and a special thanks to Stephen for all the late night RP. Paola and Stephen's strange surrogate father-daughter relationship kept things fun long after the Mush hunt!</p>

The truth was so much simpler than your theories, but they were possible, especially as you couldn't think of the actual second alpha who was still in her turret. To be honest, though, I think that I would have killed Ian even if I hadn't been converted. Kuan Ti and I had just been talking of doing Natamy rifle to kill him more easily, when suddenly we saw him leave medlab and move to Bravo bay. I turned my head two seconds to warn Terrence, and when I looked again, BAM, logs had been defaced, Ian was standing in the dorm, dirty, and I was mush. As a human, I would have killed him anyway, unless I had noticed that his skills had changed. But things went fast, and Defacer makes it so confusing. You don't see people move unless you refresh the page, you don't see your own actions... it's like being half blind.</p><p>As for the rest of that crazy day, mistakes were made on both sides, but now I'm actually happy that we made those mistakes because it made the game much more interesting. It would have been less fun if both oxygen tanks had been sabotaged and all mush had been holding three capsules each. Humans would have died faster and we wouldn't have been able to play cat and mouse all day, with each side plotting, panicking and coming up with ways to counter each other's plans. We would also have been unable to talk, and <strong>that</strong> would have been really sad. Even losing the Icarus was not so bad. It did make things more difficult since it forced us to do solo patroller expos, which were all the more dangerous as the last ones were done without a diplomat. But that made the game more interesting too, because it was a change from the usual well-oiled expos.</p><p>As your said, Ferhago, the way we all played gave everyone a chance to play their part, and to do so quite impressively, while having fun.</p><p>Speaking of fun...</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/a/9/03cb2e7b_516.jpg">Mutiny !</a> (read from bottom to top)</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/5/5/f0dd0eb5_516.jpg">Oops, wrong channel</a> After humans loaded fuel for the second planet</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/e/f/fed5a07f_516.jpg">Ahem...</a> Stephen starting to feel a little cornered</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/d/9/afa0bd06_516.jpg">Protective Derek</a> That was sooo cute. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/d/5/f3ed604e_516.jpg">Late night nonsense</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/d/5/532c2047_516.jpg">Cat nonsense</a> I think we scared Derek a little bit</p><p>Not sure I should share screenshots about duct tape and grenades, though...

                <p>Wellll everyone explained everything ~~~~~~~ I should say good job human team <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> At first after seeing how inactive some of them turn out to be i didn't expect them to survive that much. But they showed something amazing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So sad i couldn't live more <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway i was HUA!! You know i am really busy with college life this days, And i love it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> So i am busy i just choosed Hua and took pilot and was just coming online killing hunters ((Actually was surprised how kind RNG is treating me here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> So many critical hits !))</p><p>Anyway i was thinking this ship gonna end like :1. Mush rampage,Human maybe kill Mush and boom Sol 2. Mush extract under camera and we become mush free soon.So seems i was way wrong!</p><p>I didn't took my second skill as tech,Damn i never got to feel how fun it is when mush kill everyone and think all techs are dead,You bring it out. But we got PS and that mean another tech can be great. Well last night of it i advanced PS with KT i guess to a high number and gone sleep. When came online i saw alot of stuff happening on ship. Ian dead and flying Roland,Yup i was a little away and need to leave soon so i worked on projects and finished PS and i guess another one but no luck in finding MN. Then i gone sleep came back after 2 or 3 cycle later,To find our GREAT <strong>Paola</strong> ((Which actually i really liked ,Specially when i was panicking from them finding out about our Fuel number i will get to that too)) got us MN. Well i want to say this here, When Roland ran away with O2 when we had something like +10 ?? ((Sorry i can't say in detail anymore <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)) helped me in finding story out later on. So as i came back to see MN and Roland back on board, I saw Raluca dirty in AD,And read Paola comment about Janice ceasefire i quickly gone to BD. Stephen is sleeping with them.</p><br><p>Ok you may say "What if sleeping near mush undercease fire made you become sure about Stephen mushines?" Yea kinda <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Remember i said when Roland ran with O2 yup i was thinking why he mush do it,Because he had commander on his side,Which can be a big role in changing game sides when you play with O2 <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> ((And i want to say this,I didn't read all chat to see Stephen actually moved us wrongly,So i got him being mush on this.....And honestly i am kinda lost now since its been sometimes and i don't remember all details)) Anyway i rushed back to AD sleeping and start chatting with Paola and Chun and people. I gone and find an O2 planet on bridge,Which made me believe RNG really love me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> And say it in Private channel. Plan was i go load the fuel,Chun hack us to planet. But here i made a mistake that happily mush thought of it as a trap.</p><p>I called out Chun and said i am loading WITHOUT waiting to see if she is online or not. When i loaded 2 fuel i got to understand she is not. I panicked really hardly ((And Raluca/Janice would be nice to say i fixed tank in RAS that cost me 2 tech point and 2 AP <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">)) And i didn't got enough MP to finish loading all 5 fuel so i called for Paola. She came but we both freezed as Janice posted mischannel <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I was cursing myself why i didn't stayed for Chun and since i was late for gym i slowly was getting to go. Happily ! When we didn't loaded more fuel mush thought we are playing a trick to lure them out <strong>Whew</strong> And this made them actually get surprised when they saw Chun moved us. I gone to AD and sleep next cycle of it when we be on planet i would have 4 AP and 2 MP which was exactly what i need for one expo. But then i died <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico"> And i thought ship would die too but NO! They actually lived much longer than what i expected <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>Well this was a fun ship indeed,Thought i died soon enough but i got to enjoy it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> Specially when i came back online and figured out story and wrote about it in private channel i felt like "Oooh yea baby you can't trick me like that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/cool.gif" alt=":anim_cool:" class="tid_ico"> " hehe anyway fun game all hope to see you on more ships <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And you too pray that i get mush after a long time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>
