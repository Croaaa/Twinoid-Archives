                <p><strong>Our <span class="tid_wspoil">toxic</span> Ian</strong> <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/12384" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/12384</a></p><p>This relatively short and interesting journey packed with challenges from both the game's mechanics and some illegitimate play is dedicated to our toxic Ian. (Presumably absorbing toxic fumes radiating from the space plants). <br><em>Please take this light heartedly as most people are used to the happy-hippy types of Ians.</em></p><p>From first impressions when joining in, we seem to have a nice varied cast of characters that are not stuck to floor of the Laboratory, with the only thing notably lacking are more Pilots. <br>I go do my pilot duties which means addressing all the hunters. We get lenses done relatively quickly thanks to our resident caffiene addict, detective, cook and Andie. <br>Note, Terrence is one of the first to join the ship and say an obligatory "hello" and is observed staying at FAT only to never check up again. <br>Fortunately, we have a Raluca tech and Kuan-Ti designer for the back-end upgrades and repairs.</p><p>I'll start with mush selection which was in the middle of Day 3 - Cycle 3, which handed me the human card for Jin Su. <br>Checking and F5ing every second as I usually do, I'm there and delegating the crew to find the mush sample so we can get some anti-mush research started. <br>Janice is the first to react and sharing the same dorm (BD) I feel some connection so I start up a private chat to probe around. <br>She looks around the ship to no avail, then Gieole goes and pushes Nexus upgrades for Oxygenated ducts whilst ignoring the search(though he had his reasons unbeknownst to me). <br>It takes a bit until Stephen goes and checks the nexus and finds it in the shelf there but he uses too much movement and informs us that he left it in our dorm so we can bring it up there.<br>From here, I point out to Janice that Gieole has aroused my suspicion for merely ignoring it, but he doesn't hide it so it seems fine and can just add up to a delaying tactic.</p><p>Then as a hunter wave arrives, Gieole brings the lenses from Medlab to AD and I make my way there with my <span class="tid_strike">amazing</span> skills in counting action and movement points that comes with the territory of a logistics expert. <br>I count that I'll be fine after using all the charges of a patroller without teselatron reservoirs and still make it back to a bed and the safety of a camera with good contribution to boot.<br>I make sure I can make it to the refectory to AB and back to AD when I'm done holding a meal and two lenses. Low and behold, I derp and walk through AD without the lenses <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico">.<br>This ends up in me being stuck in AB after landing the patroller for the cycle. During this cycle I can only check up a few times but I coincidentally refresh when people pass by, Gieole comes around once and Stephen twice.<br>While I'm wary of this, I see a blip making it over to me from BD, turning out to be Janice. She whips by before I can click on my Puffin phone app so I can't check her status. <br>Only then does Raluca appear from somewhere in the depths of the bowels of the Daedalus- dirty. <br>My mouth is gaping and I mouth the words "oh gosh", gotta shout out in public chat of my observations which go almost unnoticed by others and the only words backing would be herself and Janice about doing something that wasn't too much of a priority at the start of the ship.</p><p>All that reaction and panic is only stunted by a notification indicating.... 'Welcome to Mush' or something along those lines (2 spores from infector Janice) and I get invited back to the private channel I originally made to talk to <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> about what to do and my observations (Damn those therapists).<br>I go incognito as quick as possible and -blip- nothing seems to have happened to the status bar... just 14 humans and 2 mush. We then started on our intricate plans to take over the ship by converting as many as we can.</p><p>An opportunity for a quick win arises as I cleared the skies for a trader ship bearing a trade that gives us a complete Pilgred re-haul for a brain-dead crew member which we don't really lack. <br>I'd like to add that the zombies on the ship were akin to a version 2.0, just doing something to prevent going highly inactive while version 3.0 was our Chun. <br><strong>Ian</strong> was the first to notice as he had the important job of treating the plants for day change that Chun was latching on to Schrodinger and the mush sample preventing humans from doing the mush needed research. He is not shy about stating that this will be a short game due to the presence of griefer(s).</p><p>I propose the plan to make use of the Pilgred trade, and I and <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> make our way to assimilating <strong>Paola</strong> who is sleeping in the Medlab. <br>Luck was on <strong>Paola</strong>'s side concerning Rebel base decoding and Neron upgrades giving us the :moral: and the better meals also getting Teslatron Reservoirs for the ship shortly after I debunked from the patroller and was turned into a beta shroom. <br>However, that didn't help her when we proceeded to take her over to the dark side. As mush <strong><em>Paola</em></strong>, we convince her to take the pilgred trade and inform her that it is possible since there is a higly inactive Terrence in a turret. <br>Other crew members are irked but they let it play through since <strong><em>Paola</em></strong> is a player just adjusting to the game. <br>We also don't take the easy route of just evacuating to Sol system early on, and proceed with our Matriarch Janice's plan to convert the remaining, deserving humans to our non-violent team of shrooms. <br>This leaves the benefits for coffee every cycle early on for <strong>Gieole</strong> who is also our professional astrologist.</p><p>I get up to bridge as the sofa is assembled and share my logistics expertise with <strong><em>Paola</em></strong> while hiding out from suspicions. All the while there is a rampant <strong>Eleesha</strong> stalking the halls with a scooter checking and trailing our movements.<br><strong>Eleesha</strong> invites me to an existing private channel when she learns of Janice picking up items she shouldn't necessarily have on her and I find out <strong>Eleesha</strong> has been guiding <strong><em>Paola</em></strong> first hand on what her role is. <br>At this point, I try to skirt my way around a definitive answer as I am creeped out/ fear the probing of <strong>Eleesha</strong> and what she made of my circuits around the ship.</p><p>Skip to the point where people are wanting to get the starting planet done and explored so we can move out, <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> releases pilot lock and urges <strong>Gieole</strong> to go down with her as a diplomat to greet whatever intelligent life form is down there and cope with the surrounding hazards. He also gains a spore from a booby-trap laid by <strong><em>Raluca</em></strong>.<br>One of the hazards spell a death sentence for <strong><em>Janice</em></strong>- a swamp that gives a member an illness and when <strong>Gieole</strong> doesn't get it the only choice is her. She informs me about this on private chat and I try to tell her to act inactive and say that her illness was cured on cycle change. <br>This is quickly halted as <strong>Gieole</strong> is right on time for the end of expo to provide the report and spread the fact that Janice wasn't even affected by any illness.</p><p>Part 1<img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/discrete.png" alt=":mush_chut:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>The fun part is when <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> employs her delay tactics as the other humans haven't checked in for quite a bit after word spread out and <strong>Gieole</strong> wasn't particularly trigger happy. <br><strong><em>Janice</em></strong> spouts out comedic lines mixed with a bit of deception to mask the announcement and also appeal to <strong>Gieole</strong>- which works somewhat. The other humans aren't particularly keen about this and gather around <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> when they learn of the news. <br><strong><em>Janice</em></strong> - fully packed with a medkit, armor and ceasefire gives us time to retaliate by infecting the prime detective, <strong><em>Eleesha</em></strong>. This done by the help of <strong><em>Raluca</em></strong> who always seems to be on time for these events when we add a new member to the team and takes of a portion of the heat while the rest are burnt out from actually doing their jobs. Ceasefire lasts day change for more spore action. <br>She then makes her way to another layer of defense, <strong>Ian</strong> in medlab. Mistaken for an act to get to the bridge to transfer into me and extract to Sol, <strong>Andie</strong> first attempts to blast <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> away then stands guard as a scout in Front corridor effectively barring me and <strong><em>Paola</em></strong> from ever leaving the bridge and <strong>Gieole</strong> from finding our priority :o2: planet.</p><p>We had to juggle lots of things that RNG has pushed on us to even survive- leaving <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> to live for a few more cycles than expected. This includes repairing hull points that were dangerously low and finding a solution for our quickly dwindling supply of :o2:, which I do by looking through <strong>3</strong> planets. <br>The first two were quick busts as the first two sectors on planet A were :o2:, Volcano while planet B had a crazy amount of zones. I find planet C in the nick of time scouting four zones that are quite pleasant and go to bed after pushing the human crew to getting to the expedition (which I couldn't join anyways).<br>The only information I gave were the four zones... out of 9. Turns out well with :hunter:s on the horizon and 1:o2: left in stocks that the landing crew of three, <strong>Ian</strong>, <strong>Gieole</strong> and <strong>Stephen</strong> come back beaten but with smiles as they have done what they set out for in the first place. I had the choice of moving the ship to leave them behind but settled with an appropriate choice to go along with <strong><em>Janice</em></strong>'s goal.<br>More time for us mush to convert them <em>evil grin</em>.</p><p><strong><em>Janice</em></strong> and I, doing some strict counting and seeing what we can achieve make a meticulous plan to convert at least two humans per day if possible (previous spores). The other mush listen intently and understand their roles. Our goal- was to convert and invite them to our private channel to share our shenanigans to these amazing individuals left on the crew.<br>One of the obstacles was <strong>Andie</strong> who kept on guard at FC. We had <strong><em>Eleesha</em></strong> come forth and spike the first time while I waited for <strong><em>Paola</em></strong> to get on to spike and I'd do the same when <strong>Andie</strong> was actually online to time anonymush. This plan went awry when <strong><em>Paola</em></strong> decided she'd <em>extract two spores instead of only one</em> needed to spike <strong>Andie</strong> barring me from getting one for myself and delaying the inevitable.<br>A previously highly inactive Hua conveniently leaves the lab and goes straight to <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> with a meal and a gun to start whacking her a total of 15 times with a few blaster shots added in forcing <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> to run off to FC. <br>To top it off, <strong>Stephen</strong> now placed his full attention to <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> and started bludgeoning her, spelling her doom only minutes after <strong><em>Paola</em></strong> did her thing while I stand there being deprived of the option to help; Though technically, I could've healed up <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> in FC effectively breaking my facade.</p><p>Affected by this loss of leadership from one of our Alphas, the other mush separated from the wall that is called <strong>Andie</strong> had to keep themselves alive at least until day change when we can start a whole flurry of infections. <br>Sadly, our second alpha <strong><em>Raluca</em></strong>, who always had impeccable timing but a lack of alibi was murdered by <strong>Gieole</strong> who had no respect for any of the other mush besides <strong><em>Janice</em></strong> before even reaching the next day.<br>We needed payback, and the first and most major set of violence from our mush came in the form of <strong><em>Eleesha</em></strong> stabbing Hua to death. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Day 6</strong> was our final day, we would have one last chance to convert humans to allies only to be hindered by those meddling brethren in the :hunter:s. <br>I waited past cycle 1 seeing if any of the surviving mush would get on to start infecting. <strong><em>Eleesha</em></strong> came on cycle 2 and did that last final touch to <strong><em>Andie</em></strong> adding another yellow symbol on the board.<br>Cycle 2 needed a jump when <strong>Gieole</strong> conviently loaded :fuel: and I took out a damaged trax leaving 1 trailing trax to follow us to our destination on Cycle 3, it was definitely a risk as it could have damaged us as we arrived, dooming the whole ship to float as wreckage in the abyss of space.<br><strong>Gieole</strong> who already had 1 spore, was our next target and I coincidentally checked in when Paola was making her way to BD where he stayed and removed the camera just before I turned him.</p><p>It would have been amazing to see <strong><em>Andie</em></strong>'s and <strong><em>Gieoles</em></strong> reactions to our private chat but unfortunately they didn't come on before I had to bring the ship back to Sol with a whopping 3% armor value. <br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Finally, getting to the point from the title, <strong>Ian</strong>. <strong>Ian</strong>, throughout the entirety of the journey kept pointing and spouting names denouncing them as Mush. <br>He also mentioned that the majority of active crew were anonymush, which was almost right, while mocking the others for their inaction. <br>The aggression came from the form of messages, though he couldn't do it himself due to his pacifist nature targeted to crewmembers belonging to the human and mush alike.<br>It was truly an interesting take at an Ian which we normally percieve as the optimist with a surrounding aura of happiness.</p><p>Legend:<strong><em><br>Indented-bold</em></strong> = identified <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>bold</strong> = human</p>

                <p>Well, then my compliments for your efforts. I have to admit, I seldomly encounter ships worth to reflect about, this one seems suitable for that criterium....... But I'm still not sure if it is the way it went or simply the participating people which/who makes it worth to rethink. What do you think? I ask again a little more directly: Do you invest much time beside the main game to write down your thoughts?</p>

But the reasoning that led me to writing an AP for this ship was that it was particularly action packed in my point of view and the levels of activity of the people who kept on that reflected that. Also, after ship input is always nice <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. This post took me particularly long to type up and I kinda did start that last cycle before bringing us back to Sol <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/gagged.png" alt=":mush_gagged_1:" class="tid_ico">. Sometimes by taking too long, I can't catch up to al the players by showing the link on the end screen.</p>
