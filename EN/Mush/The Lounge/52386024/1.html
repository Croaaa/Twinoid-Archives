                <p>Hello folks, a handful of us just got off this ship here (<a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9099)" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9099)</a> and I had so much fun that I have to write about it.</p><p>I was Frieda or more like Feisty Frieda if you will...</p><p>The ship took forever to fill up and the connection to Sol had already been established by the time I woke up. So I parked myself on a bed in B Dorm under our lovely Janice's care. Our starting planet was an easy one: 6 cases, not really many threats so Jin Su and Andie decided to organize and expedition to it so I said I'd tag along. All in all, Mush select happens and I'm human lucky enough. So I go over to IB for Expo but no one's there and, given past experiences with waiting for an expo on the starting planet for ages and the nature of the planet, I soloed it. Dropped my trackie and took a spacesuit and off I went. It went well, I only got 2 illnesses from the 2 Forest zones and a bunch of Alien Steaks from the Intelligent Life encounter &amp; whatnot. Now, the fun part came when I came back. I pick my trackie up to my "Planets" thread absolutely brimming with paranoid talk over me being Mush or griefing. That lead to a rather heated argument with both Kuan Ti and Andie until Eleesha and Raluca stepped in and we just sorta let things die down.</p><br><p>Now, since people clearly didn't like me, I grabbed the Armor and Knife because Chun was rather inactive and I got proven human due to getting 3 illnesses within a day (and vomiting all over the ship .-.). I then posted myself on the Bridge for the longest time until Jin FINALLY moved us after Paola FINALLY decoded the second base (lack of sofa and all made it harder). Things were quiet until the end of Day 4 when our lovely Terrence extracted two spores in CC next to an inactive Stephen. By this time we had Mycoscan and all that but no real Anti-Mush research done because most everyone was inactive. He then killed Andie and transferred into Janice (who had one spore on her) Then messed around our BIOS settings. I happened to be in B Dorm after having cured myself from my last illness and had taken a shower. Janice mush (former Terrence) was now sleeping next to me. Cycle change was coming and Raluca the Warrior came in and kicked her to a pulp after confirming that Terrence had transfered into Janice. Cycle change happened so I casually got up and stabbed the poor little soul, killing our first Mush. Soon after, things got back to somewhat normal. Everyone was suspicious of most everyone else.</p><p>On Day 5, towards the end of the cycle, our second Mush decided to act. He kicked Chun's behind, killed Hua, sabotaged an Oxygen tank and then sat there in CAS. People now knew that Jin was Mush, but no one had the resources to act on it. I had been sleeping on the sofa next to a Logistics Paola so I had enough AP to get out, ate a ration for good measure as soon as the cycle changed and then stabbed Jin in his fat heart until he turned into minced meat. That was us rid of Mush, but demoralized. The list had been printed after Terry Mush (in Janice's body) was killed and both Terrence and Janice were on it and so was I. But Jin wasn't.</p><p>(cont in the next post )</p>

                <p>So now the only people left alive were Derek, Ian, Roland, Terrence (former Janice), Kuan Ti, Eleesha, Raluca and yours truly. Derek was highly inactive in MedLab, Roland was Inactive in FC and Ian was inactive in HG. Our poor Janice (stuck in Terry's body) was idle in one of the Dorms. Chun died of hunger and Stephen succumbed to his injuries. Poor Paola put an end to it. So all that left us with just Kuan Ti, Eleesha, Raluca and myself. Morale was low, we tried to pimp Kuan, panic was beginning to set in.</p><br><p>I had uncovered a planet and the first couple of cases looked good, one of them being a MUCH, MUCH needed Oxygen zone. So the plan was to go on Expo in spite of the majority of the 10 cases being a mystery. I ended up falling asleep before I could move the ship and by the time I woke up, Kuan was stranded from trying to hack into the Command Terminal and Eleesha went to a Dorm. So I woke up and went to IB, ready for the expo. And I waited and waited and our Oxygen dropped to 2. Raluca came around for a couple of cycles with either her or myself leaving IB at cycle change to prevent her morale loss. Eventually, I got fed up with waiting for Kuan and Eleesha and I launched the expo with just Raluca and myself. We got really lucky, 16 Oxygen right off the bat, minimum damage and a bunch of tasty fruit. All in all, a huge success.</p><br><p>Our next plan was to rush PILGRED so everyone (except for me who was sleeping in B Dorm to recover some AP) pitched in and gave Raluca the mission that finished PILGRED. Cycle change was coming up as well so I swiftly took us to Sol. Funny enough, both Ian and Derek decided to join us at the end and my rush to Sol interrupted Kuan's attempt to wine and dine Eleesha.</p><p>I'll use the next post to say a few words to the few people who really impressed me on this voyage.</p>

                <p>As I said, things were heated early on because of my acting alone, but in the end, the ship turned out to be tons of fun as I became a Chun stand in (I knew the similarly coloured suits had to mean something &gt;_&gt; ). So here's a few words towards the few people who made this ship great.</p><br><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/lai_kuan_ti.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_LKT:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Kuan</strong>, you and I hit it off early on as we discussed upgrade and change plans for the Daedalus and even planned our Friday poker nigth in the Secret Room we never managed to find. You were on point with everything and even though I sorta disliked you after our row over my actions, you didn't just cast me away and trusted me when it came down to taking down Mush and getting your beloved ship (or what was left of it) back to Sol. And well, I'm sorry I ruined your chances to woo Eleesha towards the end and I'm not sorry for trying to pimp you out to our demoralized ladies. Oh and... for reference... on future ships, don't read Magebooks without talking it through with the rest of the crew <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br><span class="tid_wspoil">And I'm sorry I actually suspected you of being Mush at some point. My judgement was clouded by past events... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"></span></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/eleesha_williams.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_EW:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Eleesha</strong> you've been absolutely brilliant and I am really glad I was part of the crew that made your VERY FIRST return to Sol. You handled yourself and the Mush situation nearly flawlessly and you didn't hesitate to get your hands dirty when you had to. I tip my imaginary hat to you, my friend. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/raluca_tomescu.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RT:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Raluca</strong>, my dear warrior princess, PILGRED queen and Expeditions Expert. You've been a busy bee on this ship, doing bits of everything, helping around and really giving Janice (trabsfered Terry Mush) a good beating so I could finish the job. You were a real pleasure to play with and I hope you keep up the good work and that we'll meet again sometimes.</p><p><strong>Andie</strong> even though you died fairly early due to sudden Mush rampage, I must say, I admire your sense of duty and the way you took over the role of Leader. Your determination showed when you worked on those bits of Research we got done nearly all by yourself and you were ready for anything that would have been thrown at you (except for Terrence Mush apparently <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> ). I know we argued early on and I admit, I didn't really like you at the time and you are the main reason I seized the Armor and Knife (yes, you were scary <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/omg.png" alt=":omg:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico">). I would have loved for you to be able to finish the voyage with us (and to have beaten you at our secret Poker night with Kuan &gt;_&gt;<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">)</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/terrence_archer.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_TA:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Terrence</strong> and <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/kim_jin_su.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_KJS:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Jin Su</strong>, you guys have been great. Superb Mush play all in all. You kept quiet and held on to your cover until everyone's guard was down and then you took away our main sources of Morale. Mistakes were made on both sides, but all in all, you did a splendid job and it's been a real pleasure stabbing you both to death <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>Now, if you guys have been on this ship, come along and join the conversation. I would love to hear your side of the story ^^</p>

                <p>Well, was Eleesha, woohoo! My main goal was to just give everyone an objective to do. Maybe the inactives would see it, and do something.

                <p>Hey, guys, its Kuan. Last one to chime in. Went on a party streak when we got back home. My head still hurts. I don't really know what to write here. It was a great trip thanks to all of you.</p><p>Mush, I have to say that was a great strategy, morale and oxygen, killing Andie and taking Janice out of the game. I am so sorry you didn't make it, Andie.</p><p>Feisty Frieda/Orianna, thank you for all the nice things you said about me. I appreciate that very much. Don't worry about suspecting me being mush. I would have suspected me as well if I were in your position. I do know about reading mage books but by then we were sort of short of pilots.</p><p>Eleesha, Frieda, Raluca, you were great teammates. We should mention Roland as well. I have no idea where Ian and Derek came from to help with the Pilgred. I thought they were dead. I'm only sorry I didn't get to go on the last exploration with you guys. And that I didn't get to celebrate our victory with you, Eleesha. We finally had that room free but Feisty Frieda pushed the button too soon. All in all, a great adventure. <br>See you on other ships, my friends. <br>Kuan out. <br>PS. There is a secret room on the Daedalus.</p>
