I picked Torture skill, and looked forward to a good mush hunt...</p><p><em> It was my first broken dream.</em> i not use this skill on that ship. Even more, i was mush.</p><p>When i realized that i am mush, Terrence already spiked Paola. We convinced that Paola, gold player, must our first target. It's important, Raluca installed 3rd camera in engine room,so bridge was not protected.</p><p><em> It was my second broken dream</em> (i'll tell more later, see below)</p><p>Also Raluca has a good start with pilgred, and because Jin Su was inactive, i must get commander title soon, so I am and Terrence decided that we try back to sol. Terrence was gold, and had a tech skill, If he help Raluca, we can finish pilgred at day 4. If we persuade crew that at least 85% is safe, Terrence, with relay from me, can finish pilgred for 8ap.</p><p><em>It was my third broken dream.</em></p><p>Terrence perscuade me that i should choose trapper skill.</p><p><em>It was my fourth broken dream.</em> I not use this skill on that ship.<br> <br>Next day Terrence spike Paola again, and right after, <strong>EXTRACTED SPORE IN FRONT OF CAMERA</strong>. He just forgot that there are camera in engine. <br>Now, i am alone. Antispore complete, Terrence use all daily spores. I should explain: because i had bad ap regeneration and because Terrence had a good excuse to be dirty, we conviced leave most of mushy actions for Terrence. So, my first day as a mush i spend in dorm because "There mushes everywhere! They spike peoples!" I leave dorm once to give relay for Raluca, Pilgred dont make my dirty and i dont extract spore. Crew had not any reasons to suspect me: i not only never was dirty, i never entered in dorm with shower. Also i posted flat jokes about torturing people, as example:<br><strong>Raluca</strong>: Thank you.(pilgred relay)<br><strong>Hua</strong>: Wait, she said "thank you"?<br><strong>Chao</strong>: Yes, it's not in her nature! Maybe she is mush? I must torture her!<br>At day 3, i gave relay for pilgred, extract one(i just dont had ap) spore <strong>NOT IN FRONT OF CAMERA</strong>, wash and go to the bridge for convert Paola. 1)She check game very often. 2)She is active at c1-3. 3)Most of crew was inactive at c1-c3. I have good chances that she take annonymoush before someone realize that there another mush appeared. When i came into the bridge, i saw that lab team not only finish MycoAlarms, but Chun placed one on the bridge. AAARRRRRRRGH! And i cant use trapper when paola leaves room for food because inactive Jin Su was here. As commander i stay in bridge now. Next days is a <br><strong>"GREAT PAOLA HUNT". </strong><br>I try to convice Paola kill Jin Su, because "i can use all logistic's AP", but she refuse "He die soon, from starvation". But i cant wait! Crew decided move camera from engine to bridge. And yes, soon camera was instaled. I can forget about mush actions in the bridge.<br>I try to catch Paola when she move in refrectory, and almost done it! Once I log right after she leave bridge, and i move to front corridor, after that i start refresh page as a madman... She cross coridor to quick, and i waste some ap/mp to explain why i am leave bridge. Even worse, no one ask me about that.<br>When Paola said that her morale at 5 i am said that we two can go to medlab "if you understand what i mean". But she not answer. I have slight feeling that this part of game confused her... And i cant insist to much, because here Janice with low morale to, and i dont want lose my priceless spore with Janice, especially with finished constipaspore serum. 4ap for extract? Madness if you Chao!<br>Finally i decide convert Paola for final strike, when no more reason to hide, <strong> IN FRONT OF CAMERA</strong>... ... ... ... Mushovore bacteria!!! AAAARRRGH!!! Wait, calm down Chao and think. Okay i still can do it. First spike right before day end, second at next day. It cost me 6ap(2spike+1extract) but fot <strong>us</strong> it cost only 2ap, because i can send Paola 2 missions. She is a gold player with shooter skill. It still good idea.<br>My <br><strong>MAIN PLAN</strong><br>is based on the fact that I am the commander. and that crew was unlucky with planet search<br>A) If crew found planet with o2 when there 5-6 oxygen left, and IF this planet not in north direction i just will "forget" to turn ship before fly. Maybe even they not kill me.<br>B) If we arrived to planet, i delay expo launch as long as it possible, and finally leave orbit without launch expedition.<br><span class="tid_wspoil">Not plan but stoopid idea: found planet with Volcanoes and said that there are oxygen</span><br>Main point, as you can see is sabotage crew's attempts to refill oxygen tanks, and do it when no much oxygen left, so they cant found another o2 planet before asphyxiation will kill the ship. <br>You ask why there no plan "leave orbit and abadon expedition"? Yes if i do it, even if crew found another planet with o2 they cant refil o2 tanks. But I was sure that the crew would not allow me not to participate in the expedition. Because mushes doing it so often... So i did not consider this possibility.<br>That why i write "hide, wait and strike" in the title. I bet all on one strike.<br>Except <strong>"GREAT PAOLA HUNT" </strong> i dont do anything at d3-4. i stay in bridge, i gave missions, i even scaned planets! (Of course, if I found a planet with o2, I would not say). I hide and wait.<br>At <strong>d4c6</strong> i loged and see that crew found o2 planet, load fuel and wait only me. Still 8 oxygen left. i want delay travel as long as i can, so i not demonstrated that i am in game. I am still wait.<br>Raluca come into bridge with hacker kit, hack terminal, rotate ship in right direction and out of ap. I cant use "main plan{A}" in this situation, so i "wake up", cited <span class="tid_preRoleplay">D.Adams</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Don't panic!</span></span>, said: "you should already know that i am log this time, comrades" and moved the ship. Crew relaxed and started planning expedition. I started planning "main plan{B}"<br><strong>d4c7</strong> was silent. Two crew members come into icarus bay. No one asked me about expedition. Strange.<br><strong>d4c8</strong> Suddenly, <strong>EXPEDITION</strong>. Eleesha, Ian, Hua and... Paola. Oh no... Paola, my dear, infected Paola! I loved you!I wanted to give you all my spores! I wanted to show you all the greatness of the new world order! But i had no choise. You must understand. One subject didn't matter. Only race matters. I went to the rear storage. <strong>==END==</strong></p>

                <p>Epilogue.</p><p>Before I went to storage, i checked front turret. Maybe there Arax around the ship? No Arax, but... HACKER KIT! I just dont understand. okey, crew you trust me, i understand.But you should see that there still one mush aboard! H-how you can start expo, when hacker kit just lying in one step from command terminal?<br>After i leave orbit i pick up both adult plants, hide one in centre bravo strage(do you found it?), extract one oxygen capsule and sabotaged oxygen tank(do you realize it?). I was hoping survive this cycle, and leave ship in patrol fighter (Janice changed BIOS for expedition). but no. At least i have some fun asking Frieda in dirty thread why she dirty, when she and Chun tried to kill me.<br>PS. It was a good ship and Chun is the best!</p>
