This is your heavily overworked pilot speaking!</p><p>What a journey. Just a few cycles after I got up I saw a dismantled shower and a sofa halfway to being built. I was expecting a fairly smooth, silent trip, and so it was except for a few key events. Plus a few key people, but I'll get back to them later.</p><p>First real thing I noticed about the ship was that Chao seemed to have given himself an executive position, giving orders, tutting at newbie mistakes, and descending with thumbscrews on anyone who committed an infraction. The different infractions were a colorful spectrum, ranging from not installing cameras when you could have done to getting dirty to taking an unpleasant tone with him. ('Course, that last bit might have been all bluster, since I don't think he ever acted on it.) That first part is of particular note, since that's what happened to Finola. Kicked off a slight scuffle between them, with Finola arguing he was a trigger-happy psychopath and Chao arguing he was a trigger-happy psychopath <em>who just proved her human</em>, so she ought to be grateful.</p><p>Now, I'm a pleasant type, right? Big heart, dazzling personality, not overly keen on making remarks which can be misinterpreted to people who can break my fingers and are probably looking for reasons to. I decided to lay low and stay out of the chat for a bit. This had the unfortunate side effect of hanging Ms. Rinaldo out to dry, as she was the one being lingered over by his crazy eyes. Started out kind of cute-flirty and got real explicit real fast. Now, I don't mind, it's none of my business, but this is what we've got private threads for, y'know? Well, that and mush-hunting.</p><p>Speaking of which, not much happened on that front for a while. I don't mind that either. Peace and quiet down on the ship is great when you have to wind down from the hunters, and I had plenty of those to worry about, but Chao was starting to get antsy. Twitchy. The mush were keeping pretty quiet, and I was getting concerned that they were just winding him up, letting the tension get to him until he did their work for them. One thing seemed sure--if nothing happened soon, he'd <em>snap</em>. <br><br>Something happened.<br><br>I was in Alpha Dorm at the time, so I didn't see it for myself, but I saw the death announcements rolling out: Gioele assassinated, Hua assassinated, and Stephen running in screaming about how Eleesha had rampaged in Bravo Dorm. I'd been in bed for a fair few cycles and Chao seemed to have drifted off on his feet, so I got up and went to check it out. There she was, sure enough. Cameras showed her throwing two grenades, punching Gioele to death then finishing off Hua, with Stephen managing to escape unharmed in time to report the attack. Couldn't be clearer. I threw a punch and hit the wall. Then, while rubbing my knuckles, I noticed Eleesha seemed to be missing some vital skills. Had a few second thoughts about the situation. It couldn't be clearer, but not in the way I'd thought.<br><br>Crewmember punching two people to death then not taking one of the recently-cleared beds? Skills going missing? Stephen, who just so happened to not get attacked, <em>conveniently</em> waking up just in time to leave the room and point the blame at Eleesha? Transfer. Any idiot could see that, and fortunately for us, I did.<br><br>...Kinda wish I hadn't, though. Trying to knock out a journalist is one thing. Getting the drop on a burly ex-con built like a brick wall, who I'm pretty sure could blow my brains out by coughing, is another thing entirely. Sure, yeah, of course I don't want to hit a girl, but on the other hand I've got a much more immediate aversion to hitting people who can rip me apart like a paper bag. With the security officer gone, though, I was the only one around to do something. Grit my teeth. Took a swing at him. He went down with one punch.<br><br>ONE PUNCH, baby! That's the Zuccali muscles for you.<br><br>...And being hit by two grenades beforehand might have had something to do with it. But I'm pretty sure it was 90% raw Zuccali brawn.<br><br>Chao warmed up to me a bit after that. Not a bad guy, on the whole, when you get past the tough facade and the tough exterior and the toughness going a fair bit into the interior. The arbitrary torturing sessions aren't a barrel of laughs either, and his attitude with women is just <em>whoa</em>, but there's a good guy in there somewhere. Invited me and Steveleesha into a confidential chat to weed out the last mush. Told us to come occupy the beds in Bravo Dorm so we knew that anyone who came in was bound to do so for a shower rather than a snooze. Sounded like a good plan, especially since my eyes were fogging over. I settled down for a rest, confident that we'd find the second mush tomorrow.<br><br>Woke up to find Chao had found the second mush. Also woke up to find basically every part of me bleeding. Tally of maladies: Gastroenteritis, Migraine, <em>Chronic</em> Migraine, and a nose that'd kind of split. Hauled myself up to the medlab, hoping someone would see me and patch me up. Skimmed the discussion thread in a panic and saw Chao asking around for my location so he could heal me, then announcing where he was dropping the medkit. Made a comment about me taking seven punches and being a "tough little squirt". Put myself together, went down to Bravo, looked at the logs and finally sussed out what happened.<br><br>Finola had constructed the rocket launcher. Fired one rocket one cycle, one rocket next cycle. Then she killed Jin, who was sleeping next to me at the time, and started pummeling the hell out of me. Chao strode in and killed her. Gastro from me killing Stephen, migraine from seeing Jin killed, Chronic Migraine from seeing Finola killed, and burst nose from getting my face repeatedly smashed into. It was a lot to wake up to, but I was still hanging on by a thread. You know what could have killed me?<br><br>ONE PUNCH! That's the Zuccali tenacity for you!<br><br>After we got rid of them, things sorta...petered out a bit. We had good folks on the crew, but as sole pilot, dealing with hunters, expeditions and eventual hull collapse got to be too much. We made fairly good progress, but with 20 hull left, all we could do was head back to Sol.<br><br>I'd like to give my regards to Janice, for putting in the hours, Paola, for being quick on the comms and as communicative as your job required, Raluca, for rushing the PILGRED in record time, Stephen, for pleasant conversation and good work done around the ship, Terrence, for keeping us in good order and helping Raluca with PILGRED and Ian for being our top researcher. And Chao, man...what can I say?<br><br>You were the sleaziest, slimiest creep I've ever seen on a ship, and I say that with all possible affection. You really <em>oozed</em> with something, and knowing it was intentional made it so, so much better, turning out to be an incredibly well-written depiction of a hyper-macho alpha dog rather than actually being one. (...might be better to clarify it's a character shtick earlier on next time, though. Don't know about the others, but I was pretty on edge those first few days. Must have been worse for Paola, I imagine.)<br><br>That's my side of it, in any case. If you recognize any of this, I'd love to hear your perspective.</p>

                <p>So Sorry I missed this earlier Noted. I really loved reading your take on the ship. I'm packing for a trip right now so not much time to write. But I will say, if I'd said it was just RP earlier on it would have made you less on edge. I've been killed as Chao once or twice due to the creep factor, I always enjoy the tension of not knowing whether I can maintain that balance. I'm always trying to do my best to save the crew while I make them retch just a little that it's me doing it.</p>
