                <p>Alternate title : <em>Damn you, Random Generator God.</em></p><p>After all these days venerating Him, praising Him, offering Him post-its as sacrificial victims, this is how he repays us ? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>That ship was great, really. We had an awesome crew of 12 actives, 9 of whom returned to Sol on Day 16, burnt, injured, electrocuted, depressed, but still proud of having had such a great run.</p><p>The first few days were spent chasing our rather hopeless mush, Chao (who was inactive for 4 days, woke up to sabotage the Pasiphae, came back to bed and waited to be killed) and Jin Su (who did almost nothing, neither as mush or as commander). Still, that mush hunt was fun, even if we nearly did a mistake and cured Frieda with the serum... but at least we weren't about to kill her. (I'm still at a loss to understand why she was hungry 4 cycles earlier than she should have been, by the way... if anyone has an explanation, I'd be grateful, because it's driving me crazy not to understand. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>When we were finally mush free, and having found a first starmap fragment quite early, we decided to try and go to Eden, but the RNG had other plans. No matter how many planets we scanned after finding the first fragment and falling into a mush trap, we couldn't find another planet with cristalite. But we did find a LOT of seismic zones and volcanoes... And none of the artefacts we collected were starmap fragments (though we ended up with 3 Printed Circuit Jellies, which... well, which was totally useless).</p><p>And we had a fair number of horrible, terrible, tragic... er... tragedies, especially on the last few days :<br>- Janice accidentally cured Frieda of her coprolalia. Twice. Which was awful, because we loved our foul-mouthed astrophysicist and were hoping she would continue insulting us after going home.<br>- We lost a plant in a fire, which was heart-breaking for our poor Ian. <br>- Our courageous little Robo Tuktuk was severely injured while trying to <span class="tid_strike">heal</span> repair Robo Molly, who had also been grievously hurt by another fire.</p><p>More seriously, the worst thing was losing Gioele today. Our great caffeine-addict pilot died during an expedition, having gallantly thrown himself in front of terrible insects to save Janice and Frieda. That was really unfair, because if someone deserved to go back to Sol, it was him. We couldn't have make it so far without him. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> And we couldn't go on without him either, and so we decided to go home.</p><p>So let's raise our coffee mugs to our fallen commander, and to the whole crew. Thanks everyone, we had a great time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I was Janice.</p><p>Cheers to our coffee infused commander. Gioele was definitely MVP of this ship. He made it possible for us to go on as long as we did. If it hadn't been for his coffee and that pilot mage book it would have been a slow death by hunters. Total injustice that he wasnt able to return to sol with the ship. I will plant a coffee bean in my yard in his honor <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I too am still really perplexed by how Frieda got hungry that early. But at least the RNG smiled on us as Finola's list confirmed Frieda was not a mush right before we were about to use the serum on her (I think that's probably the first time Ive ever found Finola's list to be useful).</p><p>Peanutz, great job organizing and leading the mush hunt and working with Chun to protect the critical items. Really glad I wasn't an alpha as Im sure you would have caught me pretty quick.</p><p>It seemed like we had all the right ingredients for an eden voyage, but alas it wasn't meant to be. It was still an awesome voyage none the less though. Its the journey not the destination that matters. Everyone did great in their roles and the ship and crew were kept in excellent condition. And I dont think Ive ever seen a ship with that much scrap stockpiled, its just a shame Gioele died before we got to the point where we had to really start using it. If he hadn't died I bet we could have hit day 20.</p><p>Big thanks to everyone on the ship. I couldnt ask for more from a crew. I have no regrets about missing the last MMM to continue on this voyage and see how far we could go. And special thanks to Frieda for the comic relief, and for picking up coprolalia a second time after I cured her the first. Its obvious you are meant to be foul mouthed, never change <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Oi! Are you going to move those cojones?</p><p>Frieda here. I was very lucky to have this amazing ship as my first ever Mush adventure. I didn't expect too much as I started and I planned to be a simple character that did some planet scans and remained on the background trying to learn. You all made me feel very welcome and were very helpful with answering my newbie question. Near the end of the game, I felt completely at ease and didn't hestitate in the slightest to voice my opinions.</p><p>I'm glad I was on Finola's list as that got me invited in the mush hunters private chat, which was very fun and full of knowledge which will help me greatly on my next ship. I like how my simple statement that I was starving had such a big impact and flattered that I wasn't about to get killed, but people were working hard to cure me. My only guess about how it could be that I was hungry is because I quit halfway through the tutorial and that somehow confused the game time-wise. It's a far fetched guess, but I don't think anyone has a better one.</p><p>The ending was rather dramatic. During the fatal expedition I was in private chat with our coffee addict. I told him that if we returned without a piece of the starmap from this expo I would restart the thread of Raluca and vote for a return home. As we would have very little time left for scanning and going on expo's and at the moment we had 41!! hunters suddenly, which would take a lot of coffee to take care of. Gioele's reply to that were the last words he spoke. "Holy shit! 41 Hunters! Yeah it's time to return to Sol" A few minutes later he was taken from us by a vicious predator and only his corpse joined our return to Sol.</p><p><strong>Gioele:</strong> Even though there was commander before you and sadly enough even one after you. You are still the one and only commander in our hearts. I think everyone in our ship would have gladly volunteerd to die if it could have kept you alive. I like how you were able to guess when I said that I had seen a few youtube playthroughs of this game, which youtuber it was. I'm glad he introduced you and me both to this game. It's people like you who make this game fun.</p><p><strong>Janice:</strong> Excellent Job keeping everyone's morale up and still finding time to scan for planets and go on ALL expeditions. Impressive to do so much without the addictive black fuel that our commander used to perform his miracles. I enjoyed working together with you. I'll never forgive you for curing me a few minutes before we returned to Sol though!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Eleesha:</strong> You were without doubt the most helpful person on this ship. You gave me a lot of answers. Your Mush hunting was very good. In your place I would have given up a lot sooner and said that the only Mush we had were inactives, but you remained vigilant and finding out Jin Su was Mush was amazing, even though he barely did anything.</p><p><strong>Stephen:</strong> With the character that is probably the hardest to be useful, you still were of great help to the ship. If it wasn't for Janice free IT points, you defenitely had my vote for getting the Astrophysics book. You also had a lot of knowledge to share and helped me greatly with that. Thank you for bringing us home to Sol in the end.</p><p><strong>Ian:</strong> You were great fun to have on the ship. Loved the garden parties (very nice garden btw). If I wasn't such an old lady I would have been tempted to make use of the fight Eleesha and Janice had over you and steal you for myself!</p><p><strong>Raluca:</strong> You might not have been the most vocal, but you did so much work keeping the ship together during the chaotic last few days. We also should have listened sooner to you when you said our quest for Eden was futile. We kept hope when there wasn't any real hope anymore and that cost the life of our commander.</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> You sometimes said some really weird things <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> But Neron projects finished very quickly with your help. You worked very well with people to arrange relays for quick progress. After all the Neron work was finished, you made the transition into helping elsewere very well. How many oxygen tanks did you end up fixing? But whatever you do, don't ever join expeditions anymore! you get lost too easily! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Finola:</strong> I enjoyed the discussions about the medication. Even though you didn't have as much time to be around as some of our more active members, you kept trying protecting your role as our medic. And you certainly were the one that ended up healing me the most. While your doctor role might have been point of discussion, you also were the major force behind our research, which went very smoothly.</p><p><strong>Hua:</strong> I wish you would communicate a bit more. You did your work fairly well, if you would take some time to discuss it with other pilots and the crew you would have been greatly appreciated. Your silence made you hard to rely on. But since you were with us on the fatal last expo we did, it shows that you were around when it counted. Don't be shy next time and your crew will love you.</p><p><strong>Paola:</strong> We spend a lot of time on the bridge. You were also fairly new I think, but you were a nice and friendly companion. I read on the end screen that your internet failed you near the end. That was bad luck for you and us. Your help on the bridge could maybe have helped us find a better and safer planet at the end. Better luck next time!</p><p><strong>Rest of you:</strong> I doubt any of you will ever read this. Only chun is worth mentioning, but I never interacted with you so don't have anything useful to say here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I hope I didn't forget anyone. And congratulations is you read all of this. hihi. You are still all a bunch of cactus-asses!!</p>

                <p>Ian 'ere. Lot of fun. Not much hand for the long speech but I must say, wonderful ship. It's great to see how much my ships have been improving since I started playing. This was my first 15+ day ship, and my fourth, and it was so much more fun than my last three. I'd like to think I had a hand in improving my ships, but I doubt it.</p><p>Hua</p>

Finding him wasn't that difficult, by the way.

But it was also the first game for Chun, Roland and Terrence, and they ate a ration as part of the tutorial, exactly like Frieda. All three were hungry 28 cycles later, which was normal. But Frieda was hungry after 24 cycles, and she shouldn't have. That's why we thought she was a mush pretending to be hungry. I'd never seen a tutorial player be hungry earlier than they should. But as I said, I think it's because she quit the tutorial just before the end.</p>

                <p>Day 16. You didn't call it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Honestly, I can understand Finola's secrecy about pills. I didn't agree with her, but I can understand the reason. If you tell the crew that there is a pill that gives 1 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_pmo:" class="tid_ico">, someone might help themselves when they don't really need it and it would be wasted. She wanted people to ask her before taking pills, and that way, she could ensure that the person using a morale pill had very low morale, or that the person using an AP pill really needed it for something important. I think she also wanted to investigate, since she said that she wanted to check people's health with the medikit. Checking pills would also enable her to see who was ill, and to know who couldn't be mush.</p><p>What infuriated me was when she said she wouldn't heal people if we "stole her medikit". In the end she did heal people and she accepted to leave the medikit at the rear, but at first she was really annoying about "her" precious medikit. Saying that we should use the mage books immediately instead of hiding them was also quite stupid. A technician and pilot mage books would have been very dangerous if the mush had used them.</p>
