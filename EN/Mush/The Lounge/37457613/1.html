                <p>How should I put it. Well, I'm really sad that you survived and returned to Sol....</p><p>Right, this is Raluca.<br>I get that, killing Paola after the mush swapped over to Chao put me in a bad light. And sure, there were some good reasons to suspect me. So I get why one would go think... hey let's kill Raluca.</p><p>It's just that it's not what you did. You killed my during me sleeping period and blamed me for it, because I rather sleep in a Storage than a Turret? Because I wasn't nice to Hua who visited me with the terrible bad reasoning of looking for Roland? Hiding the Grenade BP?</p><p>Let me get that straight: <br>If a pilot looking for another pilot visits me in a Storage. That's suspicious and surely no reason to offer you tea.<br>Sleeping in a Storage is in my opinion a good way to save AP/MP which as Raluca you don't get much anyway.</p><p>What exactly would I want with a Grenade BP, when I had the Knife on me the whole time. And to everyones knowledge on that. Why didn't you even bother asking me to drop the Knife or something?</p>

                <p>Hi Raluca,</p><p>This is Chun from the same ship. It was a tough call and we regretted it after. At that point in time it was between you and Jin Su. Time was running out and we had to make a decision.</p><p>I will list my reasons here:<br>- At the beginning of the trip, you were sleeping in the dorms (taking away a bed without benefiting from the morale boost from Janice)<br>- The hacker kit was hidden in your sleeping area<br>- The grenade BP was hidden in your sleeping area<br>- You were holding the knife (true we could have asked you to drop it, but I guess we didn't want to trigger a reaction from the mush)<br>- Fuel tank and several fires were started again in your sleeping area ...</p><p>At the end of the day, if it wasn't for you reinforcing the hull we would have been dead much sooner.</p><p>In retrospect it was all bad luck and coincidence that worked against you. Jin Su was just a "sleepy" mush. I still don't know how we survived 16 spores without converting anyone else.</p><p>Maybe in the future a little bit more communicating would keep you alive longer, I know it is not Raluca's way, but we had to find the mush.</p>

                <p>I'm actually quite talkative - for a Raluca anyway. Was just a bit under stress last week. And I try not to talk as much as I want to... You know doesn't look good on the character and all that.

But a turret means longer ways to take especially if you might have to load fuel anyway. And without that mystical second sofa I only ever saw once and - surprise - was build for Frieda... you just don't have much Ap to waste. Standing in ER without a camera isn't safe in the actual getting-spored-way either...</p><p>I really dislike the Raluca-discrimination ;___;' <br>Paolas just have to sit up on the Bridge shouting 'where is my sofa' and everyone runs. But a Raluca can't even sleep in a Janice dorm without getting shouted at. New ship too. Just slept there for a while before game started and already got told to get out by some hot-shot. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico">'</p><br><p>Oh, and the fire was when I was in a Turret.

Only if there are free beds (inactives or dead) and an alive Janice. Beds are saved for pilots and other AP intensive characters...

                <p>Well, and that's just one of the discriminations. <br>Let's say we have two Pilots. (Or more like hope so...) That's 2 beds. A Paola without Logistic meaning Frieda needs a Dorm bed. Makes 3 beds taken. Paola has her Sofa, Finola the Medlab bed. Add a Terrence because we're optimistic and assume he is a Technician. 4 beds taken. Eleesha takes a bed because Mush ain't dead yet and she needs the power to walk the floors. And of course Janice can give out a lot more hugs when she get the additional AP from lying down. That makes 6 beds.</p><p>And now look in your dorms. Who's lying in the beds, all the time, waking up to do a bit who-knows-what and lying down again? See the Ians? Stephens? The Gioles?

                <p>Er... Ian is an AP-intensive researcher who is extremely important early on, and needs AP later on to care for his garden (Assuming you have 8-11 Hydro-pots, andespecially if you don't have a finola with both medic and biologist) and Jin Su is a pilot as well as a morale-boosting leader. Both of them generally should have beds unless hey are a bronze player. Especially over Raluca who... doesn't do a lot early on. You don't WANT PILGRED complete early, and Kuan Ti/Janice are far better options for general nexus work.</p>
