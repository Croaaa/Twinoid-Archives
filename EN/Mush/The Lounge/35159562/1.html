                <p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2142" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2142</a></p><p>Ok, I am not really proud about this victory. I was <strong><em>Eleesha, The Mush</em></strong>. Start of the game was quite interesting, as somebody had hidden Medikit in CAT before ship was full (should be reported). I am still not sure who did that thou. Mostly I believed it was <strong>Chao</strong>, but really hard to tell.</p><p><strong>Hua</strong> has decided to take law into her hands and without waiting for approval, she just killed <strong>Roland</strong> that was standing in other storage where Knife was hidden before. Not really proof of anything and he was indeed human. That made Hua quite suspicious. And he really helped our cause, because pilot died and seemed like experienced player.</p><p>In the meantime, our beautiful griefer named <strong>Janice</strong> messed up BIOS by locking research. <strong>Finola</strong> could not research effectively. Antispore Gas hasn't been finished till Day 4 as the first research ever.</p><p>My alpha partner was <strong>Stephen</strong>, but frankly I didn't missed him, when <strong>Hua</strong> decided to act again and killed him without any real proof. He deserved it. Whole days just lying in the bed and said only one thing about food. However at least he managed to spike <strong>Finola</strong> once.</p><p>That helped me a lot, because day after <strong>Finola</strong> joined our Mush force. I have successfully activated Anonymush and nobody seemed to notice. She was sleeping carelessly in MedLab whole the time <span class="tid_strike">(probably on purpose)</span>. She revealed to me, that she is lvl 9 Mush and gold player. I was really happy with that fact.</p><p><strong>Jin-Su</strong> acted very suspiciously too claiming that he is newbie to this role. Instead of shooting <br>hunters, giving missions and speeches he was doing not sure what exactly. At the end, he was mostly main suspect and was about to be killed. Nobody even mentioned mine or <strong>Finola</strong>'s name.</p><p>I should also mention, that <strong>Frieda</strong> was inactive from the very beginning and nobody was really looking for any planet even in situation there was like 7 oxygen left. My guess is that they saw the end and didn't bothered anymore. They have even managed to get Astrophycist mage book, but for some reason nobody read that.</p><p>On Day 3 rather unfortunate thing happened, as <strong>Janice</strong> attacked my fellow mush <strong>Finola</strong>. Luckily I was able to rush in there and heal <strong>Finola</strong>. It was really bad luck, that griefer actually picked Mush as the target. Otherwise I would not bother to act. Then rest of the crew managed to kill this little griefer. Unfortunately that delayed killing of <strong>Hua</strong> as she got 5 votes to be killed for her behavior and possible mushiness.</p><p>On the start of Day 4 we managed to turn <strong>Terrence</strong> to our cause as he was hanging reclessly in Nexus trying to finish Plasma Shield. <strong>Finola</strong> activated Anonymush, so again it seemed like there is only one Mush left while there were 3 now. <strong>Terrence</strong> has he „accidentally“ picked Traitor and Anonymush skill, so he wasn't much asset for upcoming plan, but at least we stripped crew of only technician.</p><p>Since crew had already serious morale issues because of <strong>Janice</strong> griefer and <strong>Jin-Su</strong> somewhat lazy, it was time for <em>Demoralize</em> skill. Obvious target was dearest <strong>Chun</strong> as with killing her, the morale will be dropping even more rapidly. And here it was, 5 minutes before end of cycle 8 I had stood in the Lab and started „buzz killing“.</p><p>First I thought she must be down to like 6 morale, because no morale boosting rebel base has been contacted. What was my surprise, that she had actually morale of 13. I managed to take 12 from her and then run away into dorm to regain last 2 AP in my mush life. It was totally obvious now who is it. When cycle changed, <strong>Chun</strong> finally died of depression. It was really lucky. If she had like 14, it would be complete fail, because they would be able to revive her.</p><p>I tried last desperate plan, extracted spore, ate it and went to Engine Room to demoralize <strong>Raluca</strong> as she was yelling around, that she is low. However taking 4 points from her wasn't enough and that was my bitter end. Soon after that came <strong>Jin-Su</strong>, punched me bit. And after him eager <strong>Hua</strong> finished the job quickly.</p><p>I was then watching progress from dead screen. Funny thing is, that I was attacked my <strong>Jin-Su</strong> who was only morale giver by that time and also the pilot. And then <strong>Hua</strong>, another pilot. If they wanted to go for an expedition before, now they had major setback. Only 5 oxygen left and no planet even scanned.</p><p>Also they obviously didn't knew about my other two mushy friends, because they started spilling their morale status in public discussion <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> That definitely helped <strong>Finola</strong> to pick another targets for demoralization.</p><p>Anyway I had some good time during this game. It was my third Mush experience and probably the best so far giving the fact that nobody suspected me a bit. Ok, maybe <strong>Hua</strong> but only by the hunch, no real evidence.</p>

                <p>Wait what ! Suspected that we have 3 mushes because all went anonymous and that can only mean 1 thing - mush made someone else mush and that new mush is new to the game and picks anonymous , but 4 mushes ? Too much ... Killed 2 out of 4 . Finola your words made me think that you are mush . And anonymous picking was stupid . <br>And sorry Roland , but someone was hiding items before game started and i made mistake with you. <br><strong>Hua here</strong> ... <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2142" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2142</a><br>Should have paid more attention to Finola because she were defending mush called stephen and said that i am Griefer.</p>

                <p>Ok just little correction. I stated that <strong>Finola</strong> might have slept in MedBay unprotected on purpose. Don't take this like confirmed information. It was purely my assumption. I am sorry about this public accusation.</p><p>I did not ever understood why in nearly every game Finola character is occupying this bed. It's so dangerous place to be in there, especially when research is at full stop practically. If ship starts soon enough and both Mush are active, they might turn anybody sleeping in there on Day 2 already and that can be disaster.</p>

                <p>It's quite easy to declare the medlab off limits to everyone other than Finola and Chun, should you have an unprotected Finola sleeping there. Then you'd make mycoalarms priority after antispore gas. The AP gain for your main researcher is generally worth the risk. And if she does get converted, given that there should be limited number of people going through there, your suspect pool is pretty narrow, so you could find both mush that way if they did take the risk. Ideally, Finola or Chun would be reporting who goes through there before it's been enough for Finola to get converted though.</p><p>This is assuming Finola's actually active and doing research, because no other reason for her to be taking that bed over Chun or bridge personnel.</p>

                <p>That's true, but in practice this didn't worked for me. People weren't listening and still going through MedLab like it was some kind of crossroad. Usually it was more people that active Mushes, so it doesn't narrow much down this way. But you are right about giving mycoalarm priority.</p>
