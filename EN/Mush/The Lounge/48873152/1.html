                <p>Wow, I sure was naive about you later in the journey.<br>Will conclude and post <strong>my diary</strong> in a few hours. With graphics!! It will have parts about all of you, some logs, and things that happened in private as well. And I'll try to compose an appropriate ending about our future life on Cygni. It's almost there. Please look forward to it~</p><p>In the meanwhile...</p><p>Thanks <strong>Stephen</strong> for being a rough and rustless opportunist, for taking Andie under your wing and kicking him around. You were no fatherly figure, but you really helped to <strong>man up</strong> and added pleasant spice into the dish.</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti</strong>, for being a gentle and understanding father for Andie. And for the food. And for ACTOPI, which opened a roleplay event to me. Without your emotional and material support this journey wouldn't be so successful for my character.</p><p><strong>Raluca</strong>, for being faithful to your autism till the end, and for being cool in time of fire, and for motherly care on Daedalus, and for healing me at medlab, and for all the roleplay you made.</p><p><strong>Roland</strong>, for participating in the roleplay, personal chats and comforting Andie on the expedition. Go, sprint and pilot through your life. You've got potential.</p><p><strong>Derek Hogan</strong> for being such a cool man with lots of things to tell. If you didn't out yourself by accident and kept playing as a hidden little shroom, it would probably break my heart even more, so I'm kind of glad it ended early. I was super pumped by your participation in our early roleplay.</p><p><strong>Terrence</strong>, for living chain. That was cool. Also, your coffee cup for Andie's birthday was decisive for Serum.</p><p><strong>Hua</strong> and <strong>Frieda</strong> for looking out for their names in our pilot chat and reacting accordingly. Thanks Hua for Serum rush and Frieda for that cute last planet.</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong>, for playing along with our RP. And also... I loved the role of Comms manager which slipped out of your inactive hands. I think is suits Andie more. It opens a world of activities and emotions for him. Thanks.</p><p><strong>Neron</strong> for acting as if it was actually thinking, <strong>RNG</strong> for pretty much the same, <strong>my cat</strong> for waking me at 6 a.m. and not letting me sleep till midnight.</p>

It is excessively long. It's more like a <strong>fanfiction</strong> which we all wrote together. It's a serious and dramatic read. It contains <strong>multiple things and thoughts</strong>... Disillusioning, death, devotion, romance, lost and found family. Private chats and log pieces. Musings on personal growth, religious views (I tried to explore the part of Andie which was in their initial design, when Devoted was a cross; though I got bored with it quickly), hermaphroditism, finding Eden, freedom of choice and what makes one human, lesser evils and greater goods, communicating and accepting challenges. Constant self-reflection. Reaching out. Changing. Growing.</p><p>We had No Chun and Mush Derek. And much drama.</p><p>This might look really self-centered, but in fact it wouldn't be possible without all of you, who had something to say. Who argued and were emotional. Who said smart things, keeping being faithful to the character. Who kept me in thrill and were thrilled.</p><p>I realise that no one would probably read an amount of text this huge, so here be the <em><strong>contents table by character</strong></em>. I wanted to do the one "by concept", too, but I guess those who are interested in concepts will be patient enough to glance through the diary: there are highlights to some things.<br>In any case, please read the Last Words for ending~</p><p><strong>Derek: </strong><em>D1</em>, <em>D3</em> C7-C8 (killing scene), <em>D5</em> in "The story of Andie Graham", <em>D7</em> in "Tape side A: Stories of Derek Hogan" (some public log content).</p><p><strong>Stephen:</strong> <em>D3</em> C7-C8 (argue about killing Derek, "it's an order, soldier"<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">. <em>D4</em> C1 (chitchat action after killing Derek! ), C3 C5 from 4th paragraph (private chat), very end of C8 (Chun traded). <em>D5</em> C3 (Kaladaan), C8 (another boasting of killing Derek), <em>D6</em> C3 (at bridge before expo), "Vote" (from private). <em>D7</em> C4. <em>D9</em> "Old notes on Commander" (war is underrated!). <em>D10</em> "Commander Seagull mission log"</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> brief mentions at <em>C3</em> C7-C8, D4 C6 (small healing episode), C7 (ACTOPI-related private chat, super touching), C8 (tape gift). <em>D5</em> C1 (last paragraph - the blanket scene from private).<em> D6</em> "Vote", C8 (Sniper helmet, with Roland). <em>D7</em> C7 "Devastating", C8 "Family" (that one is awesome c: ) . <em>D8</em> C7-C8 (Groot, and a bit of ACTOPI). D9 "Kuan Ti" (lol).</p><p><strong>Raluca</strong> - I lost our private chat ._. <em>D5</em> C4 - C8 (fire in Medlab, Andie "steals" Mr.Cat),<em> D6</em> C3 (where's Mr.Cat??), <em>D7</em> C4 (mainchat logs), <em>D7 </em>C8 (very end). <em>D8</em> C5-C6 "Raluca" (autism-suffering motherly figure, what else one needs? This one is huge, and contains some romantic thrill.)</p><p><strong>Roland</strong> - <em>D6</em> "Expedition" (end of it - event from private chat which winded up the romance), C7 (Fungic infection - also interesting to those who enjoy a few medical details in their "Mush". I really had to hurt him and then heal). <em>D7</em> C2-C3 (I am technically a guy!), D7 C8 (papers episode + private chat about "family and kids"<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">. <em>D8</em> C3.</p><p><strong>Terrence</strong> - sorry not much screen time, <em>D4</em> C8 mentions 1st living chain. At D7 - "D8 C1" chapter. An important, though small, role at Last Words.</p><p><strong>Shrodinger</strong> D5 C1 (almost at end of it). <em>D7</em> C4.<br><span class="tid_preRoleplay">Stephen</span><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Where is the cat?!

At D4 end of C8, at last words. D8 "Plentiful" (it's our artifact expo).<br><strong>Eleesha</strong> - briefly mentioned at D6 "Vote", dies in a beautifully ugly way at D7 C2.<br><strong>Ian</strong> D6 C6 (we were putting fun in funeral...<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_garden.png" alt=":mush_pa_garden:" class="tid_ico">)</p><p><strong>Andie him/herself</strong> - everywhere!

D11 (written in D10 entry). D10 "Tape side B: Andie Graham's first days on Daedalus" (whole public log about discovering Mush menace decapitating Federation, since it didn't make it into the D3. Drama and fainting.)</p><p>Last Words contain the destiny of everyone on Cygni rebel base, and a few fanarts. Raluca, Kuan Ti, Andie, angry Stephen, a bit of Terrence and Hua.</p><p><strong>About service used</strong><br>I was so glad to discover it, this service needs more love! With me, was late by day, though. I probably rushed too much when I opened the new log. So I had to remember what happened yesterday and logged it. I could've miss a few things. And I know I did. Also, once the day is over (and it's over at midnight, wish it or not), you can't change the text. Therefore, there are some typos, mistakes and small screw-ups. And wrong usage of English. A little later in the game, my C1's were described in the previous day. Uh-huh.</p><p>To stop the text animation and get the whole page immediately, click somewhere at the text field.</p><p><strong>About roleplay process</strong><br>For a week or so, I've been sailing space in the body of vague-gendered naive kid, among sweaty dirty middle-aged (mostly) people, in dorms smelling of dead flesh and vomit (mine!) or at bridge where loneliness drove me crazy, with a mad AI to rule them all... With no knowledge about what happens next, with constant expectations for the worth. I'm not really similar to Andie, so it was hard to play him at times. But trying to play this weirldy communicative and devoted person made me look at a few things under different angle. Maybe I'll be a little more outgoing from now on. I couldn't play Andie as a girl constantly, as I wished at first. That ship was just too tough. Before I knew, I acted them like a guy, and when I noticed it, there was no option other than explaining it somehow. My impression of Andie comes from the first days when they were introduced at French server, where it was a guy and also a "believer" with a cross. So I played them accordingly...although at parts Andie is a female as well. My Andie breaks easily but recovers easily, is booksmart but naive, rather asexual but quite romantic at times and with a sensitive heart. He seeks for parental figures and find both - although Raluca is young enough to serve as a partner. My apologies to Raluca player who probably didn't see that coming and probably didn't want it. I left an open ending there. As for Roland, the player asked me to leave the french pilot with crashed heart. And so I did :3</p>

                <p>When I woke up I was totally envious of Andie, for getting such an active Derek to fool around with. Though that didn't last long in the end. The combo is so rare. Well, good ships in general are rare.</p><p><strong>Raluca Tomescu here.</strong><br>I didn't really manage to get her across the way I wanted it. Directly stating her intentions doesn't fit her style so it's a bit hard to get the deeper meaning across.</p><p>First of all, she did not try to befriend Andie or anyone for that matter, but while being antisocial, or socially awkward and quite an misanthropist she is not heartless. She was genuinely annoyed with both the overly cheerful and the constantly sobbing Andie. Tagging along to be able to finalize her work on Pilgred she knowingly decided to put up with getting stuck in space with other people for an unknown amount of time. Though she usually doesn't have a high opinion of other humans she knows quite well that she can't run a ship with Schrödinger and Neron alone. She is not an emotional person but she does have emotions and a conscience. So after Dereks demise and Andies breakdown she felt a sort of remorse. At times there would be an accusing look from Schrödinger and her own words "<em>Now stop sobbing and start working or they might infect your beloved Sergeant next.</em>" would float through her mind. Right, no matter how fast the research could have been - Derek had been mush from the very start. So she tried to be nice and find soothing words... and that seemed to help herself too... but then Andie had to go and take Schrödinger away. That blew it. And again the extent of the incident never came across. It's not just the kidnapping of her cat, which was a worse enough offence. No, they made Schrödinger watch a plant die of neglect. That day it became clear that Ian was no longer capable of taking care of the plants. Andie even reported one was dried out (s)he spent quite some time in that room, even guarding it for a while as if to prevent Schrödinger from fleeing and Frieda for whatever reason planted a new banana that day, but nobody watered the dried out plant. So when Raluca afraid someone is hurting her only friend and family rushed into the lab she found a dismayed Schrödinger next to a dead plant and the message that a banana tree had died. That completely destroyed the small seed of trust she had. So, yeah if Andie had manned up she would have frankly refused him. Maybe not if the cat incident hadn't happened, but it did and some things can't be easily undone. Betrayed trust needs time to heal and that just wasn't there.</p><p>Nevertheless I totally enjoyed reading that part of your journal. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/lol.gif" alt=":anim_lol:" class="tid_ico"> <br>And darn I made so many typos in the quotes on page 10. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p>

Often bloodthirsty and sarcastic. Or on that thin line between rough and offending... Sometimes shy, though that's really rare because I sooner or later get back to being bossy since most of my ship aren't quite as well staffed as this one.</p><p>Fires... well in the end it's up to luck. But there is a way to determine the location of fires over broken things, though it's not uhm fireproof. Remember the fire in FAT/Bridge? Multiple fires are often in adjoined rooms. I don't know if you noticed while running around the whole ship but when I stepped into CBT to check, the last turret had zero charges. If a turret has zero charges it was either emptied by someone shooting something down or it's broken. If a turret breaks as part of a random cycle change event Neron will make an Announcement about it. There was non and no reason for anyone to have emptied that turret in that cycle therefore something must have broken it. Something being the fire we're looking for. So figuring out fires in Turrets is easy. It's harder when numbers of broken equipment and reported equipment just don't match up. If there's just one unreported equipment which isn't a turret it's pretty hard to localize it but I'd always go for the oxygen tanks first since I don't want them broken and then check the dorms. If there are numerous new broken things the number can tell you something about the location based on how much breakable equipment is in which room, still that's more of a luck thing. And if there are no broken things at all... I always check the garden first. I made the personal experience of running across the whole darn ship to find it there at the end way to often. Really I think that room is just there to catch fire. :x</p>

                <p>Damn you, Andie, you little snitch! I should've know you'll rat on me! I think this earned you a place on Stephen's List...</p><p>Glad to see people still using n/r/j journals. I don't see it much used anymore. Sadly, I didn't write my own. I used the thing year or so ago, but found most of my journals being pretty same. And it also doesn't really match with my way of buildiung character background. I'm more "make it as you go" type of guy (kinda like a Stephen, actually <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> ) and the journals end up inconsistent often.</p><p>And that was also as I played Stephen. Premise was a power-hungry selfish opportunist. It came out rather darker then intended but still pretty well. Especially thanks to inactive Jin Su and Gioele.<br>But I'm still curious what actually was his plan. I had several variants in mind leaving them all open in case the right dramatic opportunity came up or I got called out about my past and reasons or something. One of them even counted with revealing himself as Andie's biological father.</p><p>Anyway, thanks to all for great roleplay. I'd like to mention especially Kuan Ti. Normally, I'm quite annoyed by outright crazy characters with all their nonsensical bullshit flooding a chat. But Kuan Ti's craziness was finely tuned and downplayed enough that I really enjoyed it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

You and Kuan Ti balanced each other. With just him, it would be all sugar. With just you... I could probably do something unreasonable on the ship. Like letting Andie suicide, because better this than ask you for morale. Or, more likely, trying to go into rebel mode and persuade the crew into constant voting before we decide on just anything. Making lots of decisions of my own and such. Which is rather OOC, though can be explained by "personal growth"...<br>A villain among the good guys, human villain in times of mush menace. It's interesting.</p><p>Kuan Ti's craziness was okay to me as well. It really looked like all fun and laugh before the very last days, when it started looking dangerous. And I think it's perfectly balanced. How can one keep sanity closed in a metal box flying in the middle of nowhere for like 10 days? The fatherly part might've been sudden to the others during the game, but he cared a lot about Andie in private channel.
