First time as Chao, and had way more fun than I expected. I tried to RP a silky menace at the beginning, and it was awesome. The AP restriction was hard after being a mostly Gioele caffeine junkie player, but the amount of weight people give your posturing is definitely increased, and useful. ^^</p><p>Molly, Maxx and I quite enjoyed this ship, even if it was practically doomed from the start. Finola was Molly's favorite, Janice was Maxx's. Me? I liked Terrence, because he was intelligent, talkative, <strong>and</strong> gave me a reason to kill him. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Stellar research team, good mush hunting, but that's about all we had going for us.</p><p>It became apparent early on that we'd have issues. For the first day, we had 0 active pilots. Then our bronze Jin Su decided to choose pilot as his skill, and gave us a fighting chance. He'd never piloted before, and spent rather more time without a bed than was good for our only pilot, but he did put forth a valiant effort on both the piloting and the commander role. Struck me as new-ish player doing his best, and was appreciated.</p><p>Finola and Janice were friends who coordinated jumping with me, and neither of them were any less than delightful. Fugoshi Finola was terribly fun to RP with. Too bad Kuan Ti didn't keep talking after he was chosen mush, between the three of us we were something else entirely, heh. Poor sheltered, innocent Paola and her scarred mind. Would share my favorite bit, but stupid chat system only goes back 3 days after ship died on this ship so... *shrugs*</p><p>Chun was around a middling amount, did her job. Some amusing posts from her towards the end.</p><p>Lots of quiet, less active people for the rest of the crew. Raluca, Roland and Hua were our completely inactives. Gioele wandered the ship silently before he died, so might as well have been inactive.</p><p>Kuan Ti and Terrence were our mush. Would love to hear their point of view on things.</p><p>Terrence was on the suspect list but too useful to think about killing, until Janice and Chun decided that Jan should be spore bait in the Nexus. Terrence fell into the trap, setting off the mycoalarm there. However, the lovely ladies Chun, Finola, and Janice didn't want to kill him, since he was our only tech and no Raluca to do PILGRED. This meant we had to pretend not to notice and find the other mush so that we could make the cure. I'd had my blasters trained on Kuan Ti for days based upon suspicions but wasn't quite confident enough to pull the trigger. One of the hunting team (I think Eleesha, maybe someone else?) was stuck on the idea that Jin Su was mush. I'd scratched him off my list of possible alphas the moment he chose pilot skill. Would have been easy to doom us by simply choosing leader, were he alpha mush. And after that, his AP usage on piloting and such matched up what he should have, so I really didn't think he could be mush. Gioele had been wandering the ship dirty without communicating, but Terrence was mentioning that we should kill him, so he probably wasn't mush, given that the number of spores we'd found on the crew suggested more than one active mush being mushy.</p><p><em>So, Kuan Ti.</em> Eleesha asked me how exactly I found him, after he was dead, never got around to responding, since was my busy time at work til today. Hope ya see this, Ele. First off, he went into the only dorm with the shower immediately after mush were assigned, to 'move space suits to Icarus.' Not only was the timing of that suspicious, but he never bothered to take any other expedition items to Icarus, only concerned about those particular space suits in the shower dorm. Not long after that, he jumped on an excuse to permanently move to bravo dorm, where I was trying to get only trusted people to sleep. He got dirty a couple of times, but always stacked his actions in such a way that it didn't seem torture would be at all useful. (I had the shooter skill but was keeping the second slot open while debating wrestler vs torturer, ended up taking wrestler.) He'd also been engaged in RP with Finola and I before the ship filled, but went very quiet after, on the chatty front. I did a bit of verbal cat and mouse with him via PM after Terrence set off the mycoalarm, asking him to check nexus logs for me next time he was there and implying that Eleesha suspected him but I didn't agree with her reasons. Totally true, just failed to mention all of my reasons for suspecting him. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Kuan came back with inability to go to Nexus til just after the sporing logs wouldn't be visible anymore. Surprise, surprise. ^^ And, he kept finding excuses to go into unprotected rooms where other people were. When Eleesha found a spore on herself, I reviewed my log bank and and he'd followed her into front corridor for a probable sporing.</p><p>So it was all these things added together. And that's how logs can help, Eleesha, since you also asked about that early on, if you take the time to copy them down elsewhere... makes a larger picture. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Just takes some practice to see it. Only reason I didn't kill Kuan sooner is because converting wasn't a huge threat with all the research we had and the ability to remove spores from humans, and I'd have rather killed the 100% known mush Terrence and cured Kuan Ti. It only became necessary to kill Kuan when he supplied a terribly suspicious O2 planet in our hour of need. With most the crew believing him human, we'd have gone to his planet, losing the more risky O2 planet that was at the very least actually there. That was the logic anyways.</p><br><br><p>But anyways! Fun ship, despite being doomed. Good PILGRED rush at the end, but one combined pilot/commander wasn't enough to keep us alive long enough to see it completed. Better luck next time, eh? <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Ha yeah! My post was getting too long so didn't touch on Terrence much. He was a pretty good mush, but we were one step ahead of him there. He was also active and knowledgeable, too bad we couldn't end up curing him. Respect to him for not giving up and accepting that he'd probably get the cure if he waited a day or so though. He did his damnedest and decent amount of damage. We were kind of hoping he'd transfer in his going out with a bang, because our most likely transfer targets could have all chosen pilot as Terrence, heh.</p><p>Hi Mistress Delzoup! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> May I please have my +1 internets now?

                <p>Hey everyone, Finola here!<br>Managed not to get mush again! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br>The RP at the start of the ship was quite fun. I even kept a copy of that thread. X'D</p><p>The researches went pretty quickly at first but once both mush were dead slowed down considerably. If we had gotten that diskette earlier, we might have been able to get that cure to Terry before he made it necessary to kill him.</p><p>Sorry about not being able to be very observably active in the later part of the ship. Stupid expo and losing my trakie. Didn't get the brainsync either so aside from whispers and postits I couldn't talk to anyone unless I was on the bridge, and if I was on the bridge I couldn't do other things. &gt;.&lt;;</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p><p>Terrence mush here. How long have you lasted finally?</p><p>It was my first game as mush.</p><p>From my point of view, I would say that playing mush is terribly difficult, especially when you cannot really coordinate. I'm surprised to see that you seem to really know earlier that I was mush, that's another prove of how many possibilities humans have to hunt the mush, and how little do aliens do. On the other hand, if you didn't make it back to Sol, then ... we've won! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>PS.

                <p>Kuan Ti here! I wondered how you got me and most of your reasoning is either wrong or bad luck from me. You told me to stay in Bravo Dorm, and I also moved a lot of items to Icarus Bay. I never made false reasons to not do something, real life prevented me from being too active. Also, the planet was very real, but with a Mangarok. GG.</p>
