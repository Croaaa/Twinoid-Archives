                <p>This thread is for #13 RP or DIE! casting ship <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8216" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8216</a></p><br><p><strong>Raluca. Why?</strong></p><p>I log into the game and see that I am Raluca, same as my previous game. Only that now I was a mush. I was looking forward RPing being scared... but RNG decided differently and it was too akward to pretend. Oh well.</p><p>Silver Lvl 4 Raluca, Lvl 14? Mush. Favourite skill - Infector.<br>I was standing in the lab and noticed a couple of people had already left. Which skills to take? Tech, to have reason to be dirty, but then I'd have to remove a shower... Or Physicist, hoping no one noticed that I had no skills selected, meaning I was a Silver player. I chose Physicist as It would help me with ap for my main job, leaving Genius as a secret. (I was hoping to get to sabotage the Shield research. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> )</p><p>Day 2 and IRL I learned that In 90% I was not going to be anywhere near internet for 3 days spanning from D4 till D7. Meaning, If I didn't mutate earlier when it was in the rules then we'd get a technical loss. Rules could have been interpreted differently so there was a bit of confusion. In the end it didn't matter as after what I did I lacked 1 ap to mutate on D4.</p><p>Anyway I extracted 2 spores before any research was done, and was standing dirty in my turret. I wasn't going to visit dorms too much and injure myself with showering, as I was going to get dirty from Pilgred anyway. Research team finished conti and asg. It seemed they were pretty active. More active than usual random ship, as usually it was 1 research per day, and here, it was 3ish, and thats without Finola. Ahh... the negs of Casting ship. By the looks of it, they were going to do all the major research by D4 and I was NOT happy about it at all. We had to infect someone before mycoalarms were done or not hope to have mor than 3 Mushes.<br> There were some critical mistakes made by humans too. Alpha dorm shower was not removed, even though Terrence had tech to do it later on and there was no Dirty thread untill Finola had finally woke up.</p><p><strong>Roland.</strong></p><p>Stephen had decide to spore some shelfes, and soon enough Roland picked a spore. As I was reading chat, standing In my turret, I noticed him taking off. I saw how the charges in his ship were diminishing, and I thought this is it, I need to turn him on his way back to the dorms. He landed. I looked at the map for a brief moment to make sure he didn't move away. I didn't want to move to AB1 only to discover he was already gone. I was hesitating - no, he's still there, and this is a good chance. I'll pretend to be going to reflectory. I pick my first mush skill - Infector, and as I do that A list of Spacecraft appears in chat with corresponding charge levels. He's still there, busy writing things up. Excellent. I refresh my map and... DAMN IT. There's 3 dots in Alpha Bay now. What is happening? Was someone leaving the dorm and stumbled into him? Was it Stephen? No, the mush chat was quiet. Were 2 dots looking suspicious and Chun or Chao decided to check up on them? Wouldn't ANOTHER person enterinig an unprotected bay with 3 people already in it cause too much suspicion? I believed it would, and I didn't risk it. I should have acted in an instan't but I was going to be really careful.</p><p>The planet was already there. We were preparing for the expedition. Why did I decide to go? I love expeditions. I wanted to look active and participate in the crew life without spending too much ap. I was Dirty, and didn't want to look suspicious so I decide to wash. Went through AB2 into RC and saw ROLAND there. Tried to spike him but he had already escaped into Icarus Bay. Damn it. I washed, and only then realised that I had made it even worse for myself. -3hp, and If I was going to expo like this, they would surely notice it and suspect me. This was a horrible day for Mush Raluca. As I had almost full ap pool I've decide that the best way out was to self heal. Gladly Chun had healed Janice a cycle earlier and I knew where the medkit was. Plus, Roland reported he had taken some damage, so I was just going to be helpful and heal a team member before the expo. I went to medlab, healed myself on the way back, healed Roland and dropped the medkit. 4 AP and 1mp left. The cycle was nearing to and end and I had to leave so I "didn't loose" my morale. Cycle change, I come back, Kuan joins us and were off.</p><p>I instantly notice he had only 8 HP. DUM DUM DUM. Heelloo? Does it ring a bell? It would most certainly do for me. +1 suspicious thing into Kuans garden, but nobody seems to care?</p><p><strong>Mush plans.</strong></p><p>An Idea came up to my mind. I was going to remove cam, turn Roland, Genius the Rifle before humans (around D4), place it in Nexus, mutate and guard the RC. Stephen would have to mutate and guard other entrance of either of the dorms, so we would trap the humans inside, periodically coming in for a meal. But then we figured, we could instead block the Rifle off in Reflectory and look how they all starve to death, occasionally sabotaging equipment and tormenting the crew. Yeahhhh. I could leave the game for my RL stuff with peace then, and human players would have a great opportunity to RP terror, desperation, helplesness and loss of any hope of survival. (Too bad Berserks can't speak in general channel, Taunting humans in this situation would be great too.) The only thing I was afraid of is that players would think I was breaking game rules by mutating earlier than D5.</p><p>Anyway, sounded all good on paper except I forgot one thing... That was, Gioele or Chao being able to push things around. Stephen brought a good point I missed, though im still not sure whether Sold and Wrestler indeed can push a guarding mutated freak. Plus, humans began research of natamy around D3. It was too early, and I had just blown nearly all my ap on healing and walking around. Like I said, the research was happening too fast. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> So for this plan to work we had to kill Gio, Chao and Rifle holder. <br>The Rifle got finished and Stephen reported it was still laying around in the Lab, but by the time I had enough energy and got there, it was already missing. So I grabbed a banana instead. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Terrence picked up a spore in AB2, messing around with the scrap. When he got the first one I was not hoping he'd pick up the second one once Stephen said he trapped it again, but what do you know. Well done Stephen. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> This made it possible for us to have 4 mush on D5. D3 was nearing to an end and Humans had started talking about mysoscan research, at which point I became paranoid. Having finola now, both scanner and spore sucker could have been easily done by the end of D4. I was afraid they were going to discover Terrences and Rolands spores before we acted on them, plus I did not know whether I was going to be there for D5. So I decided to turn both of them, sacrificing my identity.</p>

                <p><strong>Action.</strong></p><p>25 minutes to D4C1. Me and Stephen having a chat and I'm thinking everything out. Im gonna Enter BD, remove cam, turn Roland, get to RC, create a free spore, cycle change comes, I enter AD, remove camera, turn Terrence and mutate. If they kill me so be it, they are never gonna finish the Pilgred. <br>Then there would be 3 mushes and still room for one more on D5. Good.</p><p>I get distracted. 20 minutes to D4C1. Something clicks and I begin my mission. Once I remove cameras in AD to spike Terrence I realise... I forgot to make a free spore. Something else I realise as I leave to AB to make a spore so its not on logs, is that I already spiked Roland twice this day and The day was not over yet, its 20 MINUTES to day change!!!! My god, what a stupid mistake. I came to the CAT and spent 20 minutes glued to the screen hoping no one would shout my deeds out. Stephen and Roland were both chatting in the mush channel with me. Although there were no names, plans regarding spiking Terrence were said out loud. Day change happened, I came back and turned him. Phew. Mission accomplished. But wait. <br><em><br>Day 3 Cycle 8<br>Kuan Ti left the room ~6m<br>Kuan Ti wakes up calmly... ~6m<br>Raluca left the room ~20m<br>Raluca has removed the Camera. It couldn't have been of any further use. <br></em><br>He didn't notice that? Or did he? I figured I could save some energy for my teammates and extract another free spore, and infect someone else. Who's the best target? Hua, gold member and in a dorm with no camera where Roland and Stephen both were. So I went for another trip to BD to spike her. Now I think i should have spiked Janice in AD instead and mutate but she only had 1 skill. Hua it is. I hoped to live another cycle, and evolve. I came back to AD and lied down on a bed Kuan warmed up for me.<br>Stephen reports that Chun is on the move. She enters AD and I prepare to die. But wait, no</p><p><em>Chun comforts Raluca, it'll be better tomorrow, just you wait and see... <br>You have earned 2 moral.</em></p><p>Wtf? Didn't she notice two missing cameras?<br>Im cracking up, Stephen is dying from laughter. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"><br> We shouldn't have laughed though, as in reality, I had just received a death mark.<br>Chun storms out with a scooter, comes back 20 mins later and blasts my brains out in one hit. Man, that was brutal. Too OP! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Kuan.</strong> Why was he alive after I got killed off?<br> <br>He masterfully tried to cover up the fact that I also removed camera In AD, that someone might got turned, and that he didnt notice it. Plus, he left his bed for me, specifically so I could regain my strenght. Paired with him having 8hp during expo...<br><em><br>Day 4 Cycle 1<br>Kuan Ti left the room 1min<br>Kuan Ti has picked up the Camera. 1min<br>Kuan Ti wakes up calmly... 1min<br>Kuan Ti is lying down...

Cause: Assassinated 24min </em><br> C'mon, IT WAS OBVIOUS HE WAS THE SECOND ALPHA MUSH! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It was all over for me, and suddenly they began working on Pheromodem. It was all there, the turning of both roland and terrence, huas spore and indication that the other mush is active too. Is it 24 hours or 8 cycles(and 16 hours respecfully then)? I saw how Stephen suggested that no one was using mush channel anyway and that other research would be more important. LOL, yeah right buddy. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I wonder how it would went had they finished it secretly.</p><p>The 3 day trip was cancelled, so I ocasionally checked the main channel for what was going on on the ship, hoping to see them blocking the rifle off somewhere in the lab after Chao died, resulting in desperate human screems <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Was too quiet though, and I guess all the RP was going on in private channels. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> <br>I must note that Gioele seemed to be the only one who saw right through the lies of Mush.</p>

                <p>Stephen here.</p><p>First of all I have to point out that this ship had scenario rules. First of all, every single mush was required to mutate somewhere along day 5 and was forbidden to openly attack other crewmembers before that. Afterwards they were free and expected to start the massacre. On the other hand humans were free to root the fungus out and outright execute them. But after mush mutate they can be killed only by Natamy Rifle. Interesting scenario if you ask me.</p><p>So I was selected as one of the two alpha mush. I am not really good at it but already had lvl 6 as the first real footnote in progress to mushdome. And so I at first I was a little paranoid myself. Especialy after I saw how fast first crucial antimush research was done. So thought I should take phagocite and even wasted one spore. But looking back from now I think it was a mistake. Noone seriously counted my AP and I was able to do whatever I wanted on the ship. Maybe it was due to some trust I initialy built with Chun. Its a crucial step on any strategy I may have developed anyway. Other skills I got at the start was Splashproof and Trapper.</p><p>So Raluca had infector and couldn't use it openly because Gioeles paranoid skill. So I had to work our way for us on the first stages of the game. Trapped Nexus. Roland was the victim in about an hour. It was lucky pick since he is the best pilot with and the crew will be vulnerable without him. Next I've hunted specificaly Terrence. First trap in RC an second in AB2. Who else would take wrench in hand and patch up the ship with scrap? I even had an oppotunity to outright convert him on the spot but Eleeshas mistake at reporting fuel requirements made me use extra and that was abandoned. Later that night Raluca made a suicide convertion. +2 and -1 mush.</p><p>But all day 4 I was veeery nervous. Humans started to research Pheromodem. And it would've been a disaster. I even planned to rush in and destroy mush genome disk exposing myself just to block their attempt. But all that really mattered was a subtle suggestion that Bacteria woulb be much more worth it. And it was massive relieve.</p><p>Next we had a plan to convert Hua on cycle change between day 4 and day 5 (She was very important as she was good gold pilot with potential technician skill. I didn't want o leave the crew any chance of returning to Sol. Even if we would've failed later we'd won the war in a long run)and soon after rampage. But not just kill everyone but using transfer skills to further cripple the crew. Priority targets were Chun, the rest of the pilots, then Chao and Gioele. So we decided that we will spike Ian and transfer into him instantly mutating so that Chun will lose her best protection. But I failed to do that... Terrence successfuly spiked him but I forgot that in was aggressive action and left o ap for body change. It was a disaster. Thevonly bright thing was that Finola was sleeping in the medlab. She had a spore from the start. So she was used as a backup plan. There were a long 20 minute wait for cycle change. But Terrence made a good distraction. Only on the last seconds Gioele noticed that I was dirty and silent and that I've done something in medlab. It was a trap that I laid there while dropping ap and the last sope before transfer. Ofc Gioele sprung that trap and became another secondary target for transfer. Good good.</p><p>Chao stormed in and made a failed shot at me while I was escaping through the door. He followed me and ina moment shot my old body a second or two after I transfered into Finola. Chao even claimed thag he killed second mush when that was just a lucky headshot. Gioele instantly noticed his mistake but it was too late. The clip was empty. I mutated, hit Chao twice and left the room to guard one place or another. Seemed that Finloa was not at full ap. While it was not good we ended at a stalemate for a while and there still were Roland which has not revealed himself. He leaked information into mush chat and we coordinated our actions. It was a surprise for humans that the fight was not over. But I commend Roland for his actions so much that I wish that he would write his tale of seccess himself. In short we organised luring out and killing Chao, hiding rifle, transfering Roland into Ian, bombing Bridge and killing Frieda. The only human pilot left was Jin Su. And later we blocked the remaining crew in three isolated zones: Bridge, Lab/Medlab/CBT and the rest of the ship. And that was all for a night. I think everyone got to bed expecting to find themselves dead by the morning. Even the mush we were.</p><p>In the morning it was quite. No deaths, some ap. I just moved into medlab and killed Roland who was Ian previously and gravely injured Jin Su. Not much to do was left and I retreated. Next I saw that Jin Su finaly found the rifle but didn't want to use it. I retreated again. A bit later Janice stormed into RC and made 3 shots. 2 misses and 1 hit which didn't kill me. And it was a surprise for me. Also it costed Jin Su his life when the cycles changed. Somewher inbetween I ordered an assasination of Chun which was carried out by mutated Ia. In about an hour Eleesha came and made a final 6th shot that killed me. 6 shot from Natamy to kill one mush? Is it luck or madness? Anyway. I was dead. But out of 7 alive creatures only 5 were humans. There were 2 O2, a few armor and many hunters outside. It was it. We've won. The only real dissapontment I have is that Hua haven't got online at all. We could make much more with her help.</p><p>Bu it was a great game. With some good RP and some good experience. Hope I wasn't too brutal on the human side.</p>
