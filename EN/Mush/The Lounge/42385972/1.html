                <p>The mentioned Mush Paola here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> My partner was Chao as you can see from the Honours List, although seems that some thought it was Raluca?</p><p>Obviously I am pretty screwed from that character/Mush combo regardless of research speed, but if I had been anyone else then the 10 or so cycles for all three main researches to be finished would have definitely hurt. I pulled one Fertile and one pre-Constipaspore spore at the very start of the ship while "getting Dirty from installing a Camera"; Chao did the same when he loaded fuel at the end of D2. With MycoScan soon finished and a Mycologist Ian, we had no chance of slow conversions and I couldn't really leave the Bridge (and only did so twice before my end move) even if there was some Defacer/Infector action to get in on.</p><p>I knew I was pretty suspicious due to being the only one who was Dirty at the start of the ship (ASG was finished in that one cycle, not that it would have stopped me in fairness) but didn't really consider not eating until Chao mentioned it to me. I had those two spores to Phagocyte whenever I needed to show some AP gain though. You lot could have actually told me to concentrate on NERON Updates more, perhaps with the help of rations, as all but 5 of my AP went into Comms. I was almost two-thirds of the way through Xyloph, had you deigned to check.<br>I don't really know why a couple of people thought Chao was suspicious, because the only Mush action he did was getting Dirty pulling spores, which is very likely to happen anyway when you load six fuel. The rest of his AP went into relaying Research and torturing Gioele after he got Dirty failing to repair a door. Despite Kuan Ti and Finola distrusting him for some reason, he was the main investigator since our Eleesha hated that role and was pretty non-communicative, at least on the public channels.</p><p>"PILGRED for crewmember" was my strategy that I was hoping for, but of course that needs the right trader to come by. When we first discussed that plan, it involved Chao taking Wrestler to shove someone into a storage, me killing Jin Su just before cycle change and Chao getting the title to move us next cycle. He reminded me about Transfer, and if need be Chao could just wander into a storage to be traded anyway.<br>That was the only trader to arrive, strangely, I thought we always got one at the start? Was worried that there were none in Chao/Finola or Casting ships for some reason. I had only just woken up and there was an expedition almost finished, meaning I would be expected to decode the rebel signal for us to move out of orbit immediately, losing our trader. Stalling with "give me food", I also posted that someone should load fuel so we can leave when I was done. Fortunately Hua offered to do so soon enough, so I accessed the FM Radio and refreshed like a madman until she appeared in the "objects tradeable" list, and then she was gone. It was a good thing I didn't start work on an Update or the signal, since Ian had already Mycologist-ed away Jin Su's Mush Trap spore and I had to spend 5 AP to infect and transfer into Jin Su (since both he and Ian were in IB). Jin Su had enough AP to get the job done, but I could have spent some MTPasses to unlock Phagocyte as my third Mush skill.<br>If it had been Jin Su who loaded fuel, I'd likely have been killed quickly but the fairly-trusted Chao would have been made Commander in half an hour and taken you to Sol anyway. You might have tried to guard Front Corridor, but two spores + a Fertile to Phagocyte, a Blaster in the Lab and Wrestler in reserve means you aren't going to stop Chao doing what he wants <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I think he probably would have preferred that, since he totally missed out on the end-game which is a little disappointing, but everyone agreed it was the best decision rather than risk a Mush loss.</p><p>Our only other real option was the slow spread of MycoAlarms that had left Finola unprotected in Medlab. That would have required Infector (which neither of us could get without resetting characters) and likely Defacer or a couple of good excuses to go there.</p><p>Mush tactics aside, this ship was pretty enjoyable as there was plenty of RP going on. Chun's immaturity, Stephen's desire to cook Schroedinger etc. kept things interesting, rather than a dreary week plugging away at the Comms console. Lucking out with a smooth trader victory helped avoid me feeling disappointed at my probable eventual death.</p>

Paola, you were a couple cycles away from me trying to get someone to kill you.... unfortunately for me, it would have probably been your mush partner I'd asked to do it. ^^;</p><p>Well played by Chao. I really wasn't sure you were trustworthy (you'll recall I noted you were the one I was least sure of out of the people I invited to that PM tab), but you were trustworthy enough to seem more human than mush, and with Eleesha basically saying 'I hate mush hunting and have never played Eleesha before,' decided to take a risk on you since you clearly knew what you were doing and were asking all the right questions. So, kudos. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_225811 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="225811">SummerMcLovin</span></span><cite>I was almost two-thirds of the way through Xyloph, had you deigned to check.</cite><p>Oh, I checked.

                <p>Your horribly cranky and painfully butthurt Jin Su here.</p><p>As far as the mush hunt went, I decided to take it upon myself to do some investigating. I did raise an eyebrow at the start that Paola was even putting up cameras. Most Paolas would have just waited and saved their AP for comms spam whenever it was established. That suspicion was short-lived, though (Especially after I checked comms during my moving ship phases and everything looked legit to me). I didn't even once raise an eyebrow at Chao. I was looking at Hua and Eleesha. Hua had gotten hurt from taking off in the Pasiphae and I was watching BD (Shower dorm) where she was staying. I know you can get hurt from lift off but it has never happened to me once which leaves me to be it's not common enough for me write off as an excuse every time. Eleesha was also injured upon deciding to change dorms so that seemed naturally suspicious to me (But I didn't pursue it as strongly as she was picking up things frequently).</p><p>I usually stay up real late to watch over the ship while most of the crew had their off-time except that one particular night where Paola ended the ship (Something set me off bad so I had to get off). Oddly enough it happened almost immediately after I logged out. I don't think I would have been able to stop it, though, trading a crewmember leaves french text and there is no notification that Pilgred Repairs were complete so I would have overlooked it and been transferred to. I might have been there to scream over the radio fruitlessly as Paola but not many people were on to react. If it would have given a notification about Pilgred I would have ran my fat ass to a patrol ship immediately but even if we had killed Paola we would not have been able to track Chao and he could have transferred at any moment afterwards.</p><p>About my behavior (Terrible text wall incoming)... I really do apologize for my final words. I had just gotten over a D25 ship as Jin Su a few days prior to starting the Castings. Every other night on that ship I was up until 5AM because our only diplo (Janice didn't get Diplo until quite a bit later) had a vastly different time zone. I entered the castings because, at the time, you wanted people to start 3 ships. I figured, since there would be so many skilled players, it wouldn't be as demanding as the previous ship. Then I got stuck as Jin Su again, the one character I absolutely did not want to touch! No matter, still a bunch of skilled people to alleviate a lot of the burden. I decided to adopt a cranky, authoritarian sort of personality which some players took seriously I guess... I also learned quickly how difficult it was to get involved with any of the rp with that character without shouting "Be quiet and get back to work". Then I got a spore and went out of my way to get to the lab to wait over an hour for Ian to show up to remove it. He never did and i was nearing cycle change so I decided to head back down. I didn't feel one spore was cause for too much fuss, if I got defacered rush they'd know who the target was and who to kill and could even easily identify the person who defacered by reading adjacent room logs (and if the perp was in BD at the time it wouldn't have been difficult because we had beds open at the time and only two others were in there besides me, Hua which already had evidence as I mentioned and Stephen who could be watched closely). Then Ian came on right after cycle change (go figure) and blatantly refused to come to BD to heal me. I was being threatened by some of the crew so I had no choice but to waste even more AP/MP to go to a person who stood in the lab all day and had little need for MP... I eventually decided (after being calmed by friends) to just shrug it off.</p><p>I tried to get back into character but people still thought I was being serious. I frowned but again, decided to shrug it off and simply not participate in the fun and just focus on my job. Then there were posts asking the pilots what they were doing. It wasn't aimed at me as I was doing what I could to take down the hunters, Hua was scrapping, and Roland might have had unlucky timing or just a busy schedule. He shaped up after the complaints and did his job well. I still couldn't help but feel responsible, as well, because I was a pilot so I felt (overreacting so) offended because I felt I was doing my best with everything else I had to do. After the first expo, Frieda found another planet rather quickly. So I had to move the ship again, pretty much back-to-back (mostly because we wanted to avoid more unnecessary damage to the hull) so I had to eat to make that happen. I go back to a dorm to gain enough AP to simply get to IB for the expo. I get down to IB and I hear people talking about waiting for me at first, Hua quickly told them I was there, though and we found ourselves waiting a whole cycle and a half for Ian which was frustrating but real life is more important than the game so it's not his fault. There was some commotion regarding Janice and the bananas being eaten when she needs them for morale. A crewmember commented (with a fair bit of passive aggression) that I should be giving speeches to her. I had raged so hard behind the screen at that comment that I actually left a post-it asking the Mush to kill me if they rampage and that was just the straw that broke the camels back that lead to me getting off early and then thanking the heavens that the ship was over when I woke up. It really hurts my confidence when people make me feel like I'm not doing my job correctly and it generally boiled down to me being a big baby and asshole about it. I'm genuinely sorry to have ruined your guys' fun, you didn't deserve it.</p><p>In conclusion... Great work, Summer! While your plan was based mainly around luck, it was skill that lead it to being successful and you should be extremely proud to have bested so many highly experienced players! Hats off to you, bud, after you sold Hua you had solidified a win no matter what would have happened since we never would have found Chao in time to avoid him transferring into me. Even if we would have placed someone to guard FC at all times, he could have easily volunteered to be the one to have done it and we would have no doubt trusted him to do so. Great work and good planning ahead!</p>

                <p>Thanks for taking the time to explain why you were annoyed. I was really surprised upon reading your final words, especially after going through the Idle Casting members and finding out it was you (given you seemed pretty decent from indirect contact on the TE forums). Being assigned as Jin Su after almost a month's play would have been quite stressful to put it lightly, and I did have sympathy for you in that last day of our ship. I had been suggesting to Chao that Roland be set up as the main Mush suspects (along with Eleesha, who was noted as not being a great hunter and very quiet in public) as I only noticed him do any Piloting once, late Day 2 I think. Maybe he did some after that, but you definitely had a lot to do.</p><p>Thanks for the kudos too, if you had been online then you'd probably load fuel and Chao would have taken us to Sol as the next Commander.<br>If you were so annoyed as to ignore the French messages and try to move the ship anyway, I may have been able to transfer into you when you came towards the Bridge (would have been easier had you not had that first spore Mycologist-ed away) by guarding Front Corridor or something.<br>Some good luck well-used, but I like to think it being a days-old plan gives me some credit too <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I just now had time to read your post about your bad trip, Badblanket. Turns out you and I wound up randomly as Ian and Jin on this casting ship after both being the same characters on the ship to Eden together.</p><p>First let me say, you were an absolute genius as Jin Su on our ship to Eden together and I'm sorry this casting ship was so hard on you. I'm also surprised that I seem to have played a part in that for you. I think you're right that an authoritarian character choice can backfire on you. Some of my worst ships have been ones where I tried that too.</p><p>The major conflict that seems to have bothered you was the whole spore thing. You may be right that I needed the AP less than you did, I probably would have come down to help the mad Jin from our previous ship. With bossy pants Jin I made a more selfish decision I think. Since I was not sleeping in a bed, I was only getting 1 AP per cycle while you normally got 2. For you to head back to the dorms to get 1 extra AP and order me to spend 8 MP to come to you simply got me a little stubborn. But I wasn't mad at you, only mildly irritated. I'm sorry the whole thing upset you so much.</p><p>Also, I totally didn't mean for the question about speeches critically at all. I had just carried 2 banana plants to the garden, had 4 bananas grow and eaten one of them. Jan asked me not to eat bananas so she could have the morale from them, which was a reasonable request. I simply asked if she was getting speeches because I assumed she was when I ate the banana. No criticism meant, I just wanted the information. I think you probably heard it as criticism because you were already having a hard time and I can see how that would easily happen in that context.</p><p>It's really too bad, I loved your first Jin Su and this one was not bad. Though I was actively missing the madman from my Eden ship, I was really confused about why this one was so upset. I read your post-it asking the mush to kill you and couldn't fathom it. Let's hope you get back to a more favored character for you next time. I love you're work when it goes well for you.</p>

I couldn't rehash the madman because I would've been spotted in less than a second (even though people still guessed, albeit with some difficulty). I also have a need to make AP count which is why I got frustrated at the spore incident. My original intent was to head down to the dorm and let you get to me when you could or stop off again when it was convenient (not unreasonable since I had to move the ship to a new planet again after like 2-3 cycles) but the crew was too cautious to let me sit with the spore so I had to suck it up and go. I also decided to use it in order to confirm you human since (I'm pretty sure) Mycologist is lost when Mush. As for the speeches thing, you're right, it was a culmination of things that lead me thinking the worst from it. That round about really drained my AP massively, I literally went from dorm to the front of the ship 4 times within 6 cycles, between which I had the crew complaining about the pilots (which wasn't my fault but I still felt responsible), The crew wanting to absolutely wait for 2 botanist to go to 1 orchard (which lead me to standing around for a cycle change, I also would've prevented Paola's win because I would have been the person to have loaded fuel, again, not your fault though), and the some complaints about morale where my name came up again (making me feel responsible, still). All the complaints coming in I started to get the feeling like I wasn't doing my job right but I kept running through it and I was frustrated because I knew I was doing it to the best of my ability. I also gave a speech at the very start of the ship, though, not just for morale. When questioning a mush about morale they tend to miss that I gave a speech at the start.</p><p>Eh, it was just me being paranoid, though. The serious replies to some of my rp statements made it feel as though I had gained a stigma which made everything look negative. I just need a break, is all. I shouldn't have readied.</p>

                <p>Yeah, I didn't mean you should have rehashed the madman, Badblanket. Just meant that I missed him already. You also never need to worry that you're not doing enough. You're a maniac about being on and doing as much as possible. I (with a capital eye) certainly would never complain about your effort considering how rl has got me playing just enough to be useful. I'm not even sure I should do castings again in the near future since I might wind up as Jin Su. I'd be a disaster in that role right now, even though it's one of my favorites normally.</p><p>Working in a jailhouse has it's drawbacks.</p>
