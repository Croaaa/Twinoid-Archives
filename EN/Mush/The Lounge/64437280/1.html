It was not without it's challenges, but we faced adversity extremely well. My first trip to Eden after playing this game intermittently since 2014.</p><p>Jin Su here - I'd not played the good captain before, was excited at the prospect of not only having pilot, but also being able to move the ship - I felt I could offer a lot of survivability to the crew just through being active and responsive to the hunter threat. No more last minute scrambles for the hacking kit! I could even keep morale topped up if necessary with my speeches - we had a great Janice so it wasn't needed that often.<br> It was a public ship. I was one of the last to join, it was already into day 3. The first good sign was not only our active roster of pilots keeping the skies clear, but also our science team led by Kuan Ti and Finola, who'd already completed several projects and researches, including the crucial plasma shield.<br> On day 5 with the crew at 15 (Eleesha never woke up), mush selection took place. Frieda was quick off the mark, using hacker kit to move us to the wrong planet to delay our search for oxygen. Not content with just asphyxiating us, she then grabbed apron, Schrodinger and medkit, absconding in a patroller. Without magnetic net, we just had to leave her and those precious items (and feline) behind - oxygen was the priority and we had to leave ASAP to get scanning again.<br> We had some great luck, quickly finding another oxygen planet, exploring it and hitting the jackpot of 24 O2 units with just a few cycles to spare before we would start taking casualties. From then on we stabilised and consolidated - it was established quickly that to survive we would have to stay active and pay attention to our health, visiting the medlab whenever we got low from a steel-plating. Ian had great success with the garden, and it wasn't long before we had 9 adult banana plants that kept oxygen levels healthy. Combined with heat lamps we were getting 10+ fruits per day, which helped fill the gap left by the medkit (as well as topping up morale).<br> Later challenges we faced including losing a few people, mainly due to inactivity. Roland and Raluca both had some bad luck and got killed by platings/shakes. Paola did a good job at comms, but then inexplicably starved to death. The second mush turned out to be an inactive Stephen. <br> Further, we had a suspected griefing to contend with. Terrence had been suspiciously quiet all ship. I'd had a private message early on that theorised Terrence was an alpha mush who infected and took control of Frieda. Checking the game log this is 100% accurate. So Terrence decided, all of a sudden (around day 10) without saying anything, that he was going to pilot the Icarus to the latest planet we'd found - here he succeeded in losing the wrench (to either strong winds or a lifeform, I forget) - he would die very soon afterwards when Neron got fed up and dropped a ceiling on him - another stroke of luck. Sadly I have to say it's not the first time I've had this scenario on a public ship - when the person who recieves the transfer says absolutely nothing about what happened, stays quiet/inactive before griefing the ship later on.<br> On to the good stuff. We kept firing out an expedition each day like clockwork. It was something like day 13 when Kuan Ti found a cristalite planet with volcanoes, then another promising one with seismic - we weren't willing to risk it, which cost us a day without an expedition. But the next planet we visited was well worth the wait - it had multiple artifact zones, and we found 3 artifacts including invertebrate shell, alien bottle opener (who needs a wrench anyway?) and best of all, a starmap fragment. Our incredible run of luck continued, we'd find cristalite zones on safe planets over the next 2 days, finding the last two fragments, just like that. Finola and Kuan Ti completed the calculator, and Janice was on hand to deliver the last fragment to the nexus, cheekily triangulating the route to Eden with her IT points.</p><p>For what it's worth, Frieda's parting message was "OMG that monumental fail", I'm guessing it's a reference to us not metagaming as hard as her by holding on to vital items like the medkit before mush selection. But we didn't fail, and the only monument is the one they're building of us on Eden - suck it Frieda/Terrence!</p>

                <p>No no, my last message was a reference to <strong>my</strong> monumental fail, which was actually a simple misclick but ruined my strategy. Basically, the plan was to dismantle the shower (I tried and failed 4 times), move the ship to the wrong planet which had no oxygen (at least I did one thing right), and crash the Icarus. Then, after becoming Frieda, I planned to get Schrödinger to scratch me so as to lower my health as much as possible, and to launch with Traitor and no equipment. I would have died on the planet and the Icarus would have been lost.</p><p>Only I was holding the medikit while picking and dropping the cat, and I misclicked on "self-heal" at some point. I ended up with 2 AP and full health, and since it was the beginning of the cycle, I had no chance to live long enough to get the AP for the expo.</p><p>So... yeah, I just took the cat on a trip in a patrol ship with a couple of useful items, while banging my head on my desk in RL.</p><p>Well done on Eden and the 18 days. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><span class="tid_sideNote">By the way, holding to vital items before selection is not allowed.</span></p>

Items are scattered all around and people can pick them up. Have a lot of people been banned for holding onto items pre-selection? I doubt it. If we're truly concerned about fairness then multi-accounts seem like the bigger problem.<br>What would make sense pre-selection is if Jin Su/the commander secures the hacker kit, Chun could grab anything - maybe medkit and armour. For thematic reasons Raluca could hold on to the cat. Talking of meta-gaming, if the go to Mush strategy is griefing early and hard, then securing crucial items only makes sense.</p>

                <p>We're getting sidetracked by talking about arbitrary rules that are not enforced by the game mechanics, that you can only find out by reading the forum - (I suspect they only exist so people can score imaginary internet points about correct play in forum discussions). I don't believe any Chun ever got sanctioned by holding the medkit preselection. If it were that important for fairness, then it could be easily coded in to have shipwide "jolt" that makes everyone drop their items at the mush selection cycle change. It would save the SDF a lot of time and trouble when it comes to sorting through player reports were it a genuine issue. Personally I'd rather they spent more time banning multi-accounts.<br> <br>I'll try a different tack because I don't think I've got my main point across too well. If the mush can do their job/destroy a ship by immediately rampaging after selection, then isn't that rather uninteractive gameplay? After all, Mush is marketed as a social, multiplayer experience. Stopping Chun from holding onto the medkit preselection is simply promoting a form of uninteractive, "early bird gets the worm" gameplay. God knows the mush have been given plenty of unique tools to mess with a ship - if rampaging is made less of an option for them early on, I dare say you have a more interesting, more interactive game. I think mush players "grief" because they don't really want to play as a mush, but at least want to try and do the most damage with the least effort applied - it just so happens that one of the arbitrary rules, made with the absolute best intentions I'm sure, lines up really well with this lazy, toxic style of uninteractive gameplay - to hide behind it in this context is an act of unbridled cynicism.</p>

                <p>Of course people get reported and receive SDF points for holding items pre-selection. They usually don't get banned because it's minor rule-breaking and they rarely do it again after the first time. Plus, holding some items in general, not just pre-selection, can be reported. Preventing access to the medikit in particular (deliberately, not just because you forgot to drop it accidentally) puts the crew in danger.</p><p>The Neutral Play rule is not arbitrary, it was debated between the players and the moderators based on real situations, not hypothetical theories about what could happen. It was clear fairly early that there had to be restrictions before selection, or the game would not be fair, especially on slow-filling ships. It's the shame they had to be made official rules instead of common sense recommendations, but if it wasn't reportable, some people would do it anyway.</p>
