                <p>We all have our own set of holidays in our countries, but with some big ones happening in North America (specifically Canada Day and the Fourth of July), I've found myself curious. Which holidays are in name only and which ones get big celebrations where you are from?</p><p>This is in the Mush Lounge rather than General Twinoid for two reasons; because it does have an impact on ships (active holidays mean more time AFK), and because I don't really venture outside of the Mush community. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Here in America, most of our major holidays tend to be celebrated by gathering family together and eating lots of food - patriotic ones tend to get cookouts and ones like Christmas, Easter, and Thanksgiving are more classic feasts. The Fourth of July is notable for fireworks shows and parades; Memorial Day and Labor Day also feature parades and national pride. A handful of lesser holidays are considered "Federal" holidays, which means government buildings and most work places are closed to allow their workers freedom to celebrate, and they tend to mark an important event or person in our country's history. Election Days aren't truly holidays because it's a responsibility rather than a celebration, but it affects people's schedules because they have to take the time to visit a polling place - there's one main one in November, and others can be scheduled locally to address important issues as needed.</p><p>On a more local scale, plenty of holidays and events are recognized even if time isn't given off work. It's common for a city or town to set aside a specific week for a festival or fair celebrating something they are known for; often this is a type of produce or flower. The event is themed around this central focus - a pumpkin festival will feature competitions for the biggest pumpkin and a variety of (sometimes unusual) pumpkin foods, a strawberry one will have competitions for the best jam or desert, etc.</p><p>So what's it like where you are from? Feel free to talk about specific ways of celebrating and local events and festivities if your country has already been mentioned.</p>

                <p>So firstly this is going to be a view from Scotland, so there might be some different ways of doing things in England, Wales and Ireland. We have a few big festivals but probably not as many as you guys over there in america.</p><p>The main distinction between us is probably Bonfire night (5 Nov), also known as guy fawkes night. It usually is celebrated in public parks with a massive bonfire and lots and lots of fireworks. Depending where you live there can also be major torchlight processions where people of all ages hold up burning touches as they march through town to finally throw them into the bonfire. Its a day event with usually a miniature fair set up near the bonfire for the amusement of the town/city.</p><p>Halloween also used to be quite different here in Scotland where kids would dress up and performed for the people they visited. If their performance was good they would be rewarded with sweet things (not just sweets but toffee apples, and cake too). Some establishments also ran free events for kids, like restaurants inviting kids into their kitchen to make toffee apples or to decorate cakes. This was called guising, but in recent years this has become more like the Trick or Treating seen in other countries.</p><p>New Years and Christmas are very similar to what <span class="tid_user tid_user_8281354 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8281354">Isidarth</span> described, but new years is more of a community event then a family one. With big groups gathering around clock towers with music playing while we all wait till midnight.</p><p>Usually each town also has some sort of Gala during the summer, but this changes from place to place. Ours is a week long thing with lots of events happening in town and pretty much everyone getting involved with something. Ours also consists of themed parades, competitions, music, silly races (egg and spoon race, sack race, three legged race, ect), and other festivities mostly on the silly side.</p><p>We have a handful of bank holidays (including Saint Patricks day) but usually they are ether an excuse for drinking or just a little break from work.</p><p>Finally there is Easter and i don't know much about how people spend this holiday to be honest. I usually just see people exchanging Easter eggs, maybe some egg decorating for the kids and that's really about it. The issue is that the holiday is right before the major exam/handin period for students so most younger people are studying or working hard. They do get a few weeks off normal schooling though.</p><p>I have probably missed a few holidays, but someone else will probably correct me if i have.</p>
