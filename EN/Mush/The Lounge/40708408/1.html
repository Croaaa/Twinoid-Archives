This was only my 3rd ship, and I'll never forget it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The Mushy shenanigans were over with quickly, but I'll let others tell that sordid tale. They didn't stand much chance anyway, because the research team was fantastic. Actually, the whole ship was fantastic for the first week. We knocked out all the research and NERON projects right away, including Plasma Shield. We got 3 drones and I upgraded them all to Turbo and Firefighter. We had a steady supply of Scrap flowing in, and our hull was usually close to 100. Oh, and we got a Jumpkin on our first expo, and had all the plants grafted within a few days, turning out 5 of the delicious gourds every day. I really thought we'd make it to Eden.</p><p>By the time we reached Day 20, we were taking a severe punishment every single cycle (except those blessed moments of serenity when GPU kicked in). The active crew rushed around keeping us all alive. They were <em>really</em> on top of it, tracking everybody's HP and keeping us all close to max health. Hunters and broken stuff kept me busy. <em>(MAN I missed the Teslatron Reservoir. Did I mention that? Once or twice?)</em></p><p>We had 1 Starmap Fragment, and pushed as hard as we could to make it to Eden. But then we lost Stephen in a Crystalite zone, and got another brutal beat-down when we went to bring him back. We were out of food and just couldn't scrape together enough energy to heal each other. Most of us wanted to go home, but a few (including Commander Gioele) wanted to keep trying for Eden. So... we MUTINIED! Muahahaaa!!</p><p>There's more I'd like to say, but that's a good start for now. Thank you all for a wonderful trip.</p>

                <p>Derek (originally Alpha Mush Ian) here!</p><p><strong>===My mush life can basically be described as a series of fails.===</strong></p><p><em>Fail number one</em></p><p>Mushpedia told me that Mycoalarms are a good target for Green Jelly, because it is "easily missed". So, my genius plan is to Green Jelly a newly made MycoAlarm and "accidentally" hide it in Medlab (with people in room, so they can see it's hidden). Unfortunately, a few cycles later, NERON made a big fat announcement about a broken MycoAlarm. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Since I grabbed the MycoAlarm pretty early on, it looked REALLY bad for me. Fortunately, there were 4 people in the Lab when MycoAlarms were finished, so I quickly suggested this possibility to take off some heat from myself.</p><p>Needless to say, I've since fixed that offending Mushpedia entry.</p><p><em>Fail number two</em></p><p>Jin Su, my mush partner didn't believe in planning things together it seems. While I was conjuring up grand mush plans in glee, he decided all on his own to rampage on Janice...except he failed his rampage and didn't kill anyone. Recall that I'm Ian, so I can't exactly help him much.</p><p>I begged and begged for missions from him, but he refused to give me any. He even called me a creep for asking for them. I was a bit confused on how that works. You see, I needed the missions desperately to "prove" myself a human by eating a ration in front of someone and looking like I'm gaining APs. Well, that plan didn't work out.</p><p>Not only that, because Jin Su got himself killed early on, I soon find myself a solo Pacifist mush, who is already a suspect thanks to that MycoAlarm fail! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Fail number three</em></p><p>Thanks Jin Su's death, RFS is now a possibility, so it becomes impossibly hard for me to get any humans killing each other. I lost the trust of my crew thanks to the MycoAlarms fail. So, I only have one option available to me: rampage.</p><p>I waited VERY long for a time most of the crew is offline (this is HARD on this ship...Chun with RFS is like <strong>always</strong> online). Anyway, finally, I couldn't wait anymore. I made a guess of when Chun is offline, and then executed my rampage plan, which is to transfer into Derek and kill the pilots, since we have a hunter problem.</p><p>Well. Where do I start.</p><p>1. Derek only had 2 APs<br>2. My second attack gave me a <em>Punctured Lung</em>, which put a stop to my rampage<br>3. Chun secretly hidden a Pilot magebook, so my plan wasn't that good anyway</p><p>Not too long later, Chun woke up and RFS-ed me.</p><p><strong>===My new human life had a rough start.===</strong></p><p>I had <em>Punctured Lung</em> and 0 APs. I can't even drop things or lie down in a bed. I was losing 2 HPs <strong>every cycle</strong> from that injury, and I wasn't able to communicate at all (thanks to injury AND lack of talkie)!</p><p>By some miracle, the Medlab bed was empty, so I stayed awake in RL as long as I can just so I can do self-surgery (I had to wait in Medlab for 2 cycles to get 2 APs to lie down in bed, and then another 2 cycles to get 4 APs to do the surgery). I was down to 3 HP by the time I did the surgery, and I had just enough APs to use a Bandage, ran into BD where my talkie was, and beg the people I just tried to kill for some emergency healing. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It was pretty scary. And very humiliating. When I finally got my talkie back, I realised the entire human crew was laughing at my odd behaviour, not realising what I just went through. I spent the rest of the day explaining myself trying to regain a modicum of respect. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Chun here. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Not much to add to what Sagittaeri said about the mush hunt part of the ship, except that even for humans, that mycoalarm fail made the hunt less interesting than it could have been, since it reduced the suspects to the four people who were in the lab when mycoalarms were finished, two of which later got an illness during an expedition. It would have been a lot more fun if the list of suspects had been larger, especially as some of the humans were behaving more suspiciously than Ian (like Eleesha, who wasn't very active and got dirty doing research without the apron, or semi-active Roland, whom Derek kept kicking into turrets and isolated places and who kept escaping and idling in corridors and bays).</p><p>Oh, and Jin Su has to be awarded the medal of the lamest mush excuse ever, thanks to his "got dirty from something" response. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> And I'd really like to understand why his last words were "Paola, your turn now"...</p><p>As for the mutiny stuff... Well, we hadn't been doing so bad until today, although it's a little hard to keep a ship in one piece and keep a crew alive when several members go inactive in turns, some for a few days, others repeatedly. The main problem was that no matter how hard we tried, the RNG refused to give us the last two starmap fragments we needed. One last expedition this morning ended with Stephen getting MIA and being rescued after being steel plated while lost in a cristallite field (so logical...).</p><p>By then, the most active members of the crew had had enough of constantly healing, repairing, putting out fires, healing again, while others didn't help much (or not at all) but still expected to be kept alive, insisted on wasting food and had to be kicked out of beds that they didn't deserve (like Paola, who kept working on comms and Neron updates during the last days, even though, of course, projects had been finished for days <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico">). So several of us asked Gioele to send us back to Sol when we returned from the expedition, while Gioele and Stephen argued that we could still go on. As we were struggling to find AP to heal everyone from expedition injuries and ship injuries, put out the current fires and fix the O2 tanks, Gioele took us out of orbit, while we kept arguing that even if we managed to save everyone that cycle, most of the actives would be out of AP and out of food the next cycle. So eventually, Terrence and Derek started to plot our mutiny. They scraped together a coffee, the last jumpkin of the day and the last ration, Terrence fixed the hacked kit, and Derek hacked us back to Sol. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hi, Shadowlake! Thanks for stopping by!</p><p>Honestly, I <em>really</em> wanted to keep trying for Eden too. I practically pleaded with Chun in PM to "cut our losses" and narrow the healing efforts to the core crew who kept us going. But in the end, I realized that even that wasn't realistic - there was no way we could have made it. And this MUTINY business sounded like <strong>terrible fun!</strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But it really was a desperate act, and we just <em>barely</em> made it. We spent half an hour in IRC trying to figure out how to get that last ration up to the bridge, because we were all completely spent. Finally Derek came up with a plan (attributed to me at first, but I was actually thinking of a different plan <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink2.png" alt=":wink:" class="tid_ico">) and all three of us spent every last drop of MP we had. Then Derek basically got lucky with the Hacker Kit - it could have easily failed. But he had <em>exactly</em> enough left over to fire up Pilgred and take us home. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Chun / <span class="tid_user tid_user_516 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="516">Peanutz</span> You've been like a mentor to me. I've said thanks a lot, but I want to say it again. You're awesome! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I also want to thank Janice, Derek, Ian, Stephen, and Gioele for doing such a fantastic job of keeping us all alive. Andie and Kuan Ti also did a great job of filling in where needed. Frieda had some RL stuff come up, but she did her best to help out where she could, and we really appreciated everything she did for us. <strong><em>Frieda, we love you!!</em></strong></p>

                <p>Yes, that's probably the explanation. In any case, I feel sorry for Ian for being stuck with such a useless partner. Things could have been a lot different with another alpha mush... and without Musphedia giving dangerous advice...</p><p>Thanks, Versatio. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico"> You were really awesome too, I would never have thought that it was only your third ship. And you were amazingly active, shooting hunters, fixing half the ship every other cycle, healing people... As you say, most of the crew was great, but you were impressive, doing so many jobs all at once.</p><p>As for "cutting our losses", to be honest, some of us had already been doing selective healing for a few days. it made me really angry to see Paola ask to be healed and walk by us, totally ignoring our please for help while we were once again trying to find enough AP to heal each other. Or to see her eat and take a bed from pilots, healers and technicians, only to establish the connection again and again and do Neron updates... Not to mention Eleesha, going inactive every other day, then wasting food and trying to use beds, just so that she could do useless repairs like doors, turrets or fuel tanks. (She didn't know it, but she was living dangerously there. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> It's a standing joke in TE that nothing makes me angrier than people wasting AP on fixing fuel tanks when there are more pressing, life-threatening emergencies.)</p>

                <p>Stop beating yourself, Frieda, please. You did what you could, you did do your job for most of the trip, and when it became more difficult for you, you still helped when you were around. You healed people, you put out fires, you repaired stuff, you helped us water the plants (while Hua, who was a botanist, hadn't touched a plant in days and let Janice and I use precious AP on watering and treating). You didn't ignore us when we asked for help, and didn't do useless things while people had almost been injured to death.</p><p>And it's definitely not your fault if we didn't go to Eden. It was just bad luck. Look at that other TE ship that started at the same time as our ship and finished on D20 like us. They found Eden after scanning 37 planets and doing 12 expeditions, while we didn't find it after 75 planets and 20 expeditions. We tried, we weren't lucky, that's all.</p>

It was a great voyage.</p><p>We really did a great job keeping everyone alive right up until the end though. Much credit to Chun and the rest that were going around every cycle checking on everyone and reporting/healing damage.</p><p>And Freida please dont be so hard on yourself. You were active enough to do your job. When your knew your activity was going to drop you notified us and moved to a location where we could easily see if you needed healing. When you were online you communicated and used your ap to help us keep things going. We couldnt ask for or expect more from anyone. Keep things in perspective though, this is just a game. I hope you are doing what you need to do to take care of yourself. We all care about you and appreciate having you with us.
