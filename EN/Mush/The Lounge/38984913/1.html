                <p><strong>The Daedalus from Hell!</strong></p><p>Well, I couldn't think of a better title... I suck at picking headlines. But I thought this ship deserved an AP thread after having such an abrupt and <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4212">unexpected ending</a>.</p><p>We were only 16 normal people on a normal ship... but we soon found it there was nothing normal on the crew, and that the ship it wasn't normal (sometimes it felt like a MMM sort of crew)... it was <strong><em>MURDEROUS</em></strong>!!!</p><p>First thing first, I'll introduce some of the most active crewmates:<br>- <em>Andie Graham</em>; awesome pilot and second in unofficial command after Ian <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br>- <em>Roland Zuccali</em>; great pilot, despite the fact that he never told us when he was going out... but if you saw hunters vanishing, you could be sure Roland was involved in it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">... oh, and he fixed stuff too, so that's cool too!<br>- <em>Frieda Bergmann</em>; great astronav, it goes to show there's nothing impossible for an astronav with sofa and Logistics' buff.<br>- <em>Lai Kuan-Ti</em>; designer, jack-of-all-trades, and biologist.<br>- <em>Terrence Archer</em>; who with his miraculous drones helped us in staying alive longer than we should, also great pilot.<br>- <em>Ian Soulton</em>; Chief Scientist, and Botanist... who with his plantation of 7 jumpkins gave the crew a constant supply of tasty jumpkins and breathable O2. Supporter of SCIENCE, who made possible many of the scientific advances in the ship. Also bossy and annoying as hell.<br><span class="tid_sideNote">Don't deny it... like you haven't thought of it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></span><br>- <em>Raluca Tomescu</em>; who helped a lot... I don't really know much because I wasn't around that part of the ship, so feel free to fill in the gaps, Raluca <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>- <em>Paola Rinaldo</em>; Main Comms Officer, and secondary astronav, who supported Frieda in finding planets.<br>- <em>Zhong Chun;</em> a pity you couldn't be with us more often, but can't blame RL, yet whenever you were around, you did as best as you could.<br>- <em>Derek Hogan</em>; Fire Slayer and Fixer of the Broken Stuff! He rarely talked... but whenever a fire started, he immediately went and killed it. Like a hero.<br>- <em>Janice Kent</em>; our only shrink, who despite being unable to be as active as she would prefer, did a damn good job keeping us alive. In the end, it was a pity no one kept her morale up <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"><br>- <em>Stephen Seagull</em>; jack-of-all-trades, and good successor in Commander title after Jin Su's demise. It was a good change, if you ask me.<br>- <em>Jin Su</em>; uhhh, Commander? Sorry, Jin, but you were rather inactive... you did help, though, I won't deny that. In the end the ship did what many were thinking <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br>- <em>Eleesha Williams</em>; she died like she lived: inactive.<br>- <em>Gioele Rinald</em>; MUSH! Killed by Andie in one swift strike.<br>- <em>Jiang Hua</em>; MUSH! Killed by Andie in another swift strike.</p><p>Summary:<br>It was a great ship... really great. I mean, for any ship surviving till D17 is an awesome accomplishment! And we were no MMM nor Mushday ship! We had a really good crew, almost no inactives (and those who were, it was due to RL circumstances that couldn't be avoided).<br>There was a good synergy among all, despite some heated encounters between some crewmates, due to the stress we were under.<br>Yet, the RNG saw this (around D7 or so) and said... "<em>Thou shalt not live!</em>" But we did; for 17 days, until a planet went totally bananas on Derek and murdered him on C8. Afterwards on cycle (and day) change, 3 more deaths due to fire/injures/depression made it clear that we were not welcome anymore.</p><p>RIP Derek, Andie, Janice, Stephen... you will all be missed. You deserved to return to Sol with us.<br>Yet we got greedy, and that outcome wasn't expected at all.</p><p>So, if you happen to find this thread, feel free to complete any missings I may have had. Or just to say HI! so we all know who was each other.</p><p>By the way... I was Ian <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/cool.gif" alt=":anim_cool:" class="tid_ico"></p>
