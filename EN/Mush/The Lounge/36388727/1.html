                <p>This Ship was just sick. The first Alpha Mush was Janice who gave herself away by saying it was her first time playing the character when she had 4th level skills. Then Roland, Terrance and I figured out Gioele was probably our second mush and went to kill him. That's when things went crazy! I wound up holding Raluca hostage in the Refectory thinking she was Mush while she went insane on me.</p><p>I was Jin Su and I'm just saying enough to help you recognize the ship right now because I'm tight on time. I really want to discuss this and figure out what happened. We had our mush hunt well under control until crazy timing issues sent everything sideways on us.</p><p>More on this soon. Hope you guys who were active find this and join me here. I had more fun on this insane random ship than any ship I've been on before. Thanks.</p>

                <p>Sorry Rain, it sounded like you were questioning whether I did proper investigation before a kill and were schooling me. When I'd already said, <cite>I'm just saying enough to help you recognize the ship right now</cite> that seemed out of line to me and made me snippish in return. If it wasn't meant that way then I take mine back too.</p>

                <p>Oh yes i am both rich and powerful, powerful as the mush. The ship was obviously doomed but i hoped to speed along its way. The ship began day 2 Cycle 1 and half the crew seemed like they barely completed the tutorial before quitting. Janice the Mush ate was not responding, so it was just me. I walked to the refractory and pulled out 2 spores on the way, cooked and ate a truely tasteless mass of gruel the humans called rations. Went and showered, but the humans freaked about the ration. It was truely illogical. A doomed ship like that aught to be eating as much as possible to make up for the sleepers. But some quick talking, and blustering managed to deflect attention. I had to be primary suspect now, oh well.</p><p>Janice finally jumped up and immediately picked anonymush, and wandered out into the central corridor. I had just previously spiked the brain dead stephen as a just in case measure. So she spikes him too and walks into the nexus. I mention her error of both taking anonymush after being afk for more than 24 hours. Later i found out she extracted a spore infront of Stephen before sporing him. *facepalm*</p><p>Jin Su and Terrnace and Roland started a Mush hunt by execution after that.</p><p>My plan was to move to Lab and finish the spike on Stephen. Then go find Raluca spike and Transfer into her. Raluca was level 4 and hadn't used her genius yet. Air was also low at 14 left, i planed to go sabatoge the tanks after repicking mush traits.</p><p>Its D3 C7 and jinsu enters the A.Dorm and i panic a little. I get up and leave and move up to the labratory where stephen had moved too. Good news and kinda bad news Ian is in Labratory. I wait, and they kill Hua. D3 C8. Its 30 minutes before day change Jinsu and Terrance enter the lab.</p><p>Sooo.... im next.</p><p>I wonder if they plan on waiting for cycle change or attacking now? Well in 20 minutes my plan begins. I keep refreshing every minute or so.</p><p>I refresh... and Im down to 2hp! Quickly spike Stephen and move up to where Raluca is standing. I make a stop into bridge because i planned to waste some AP hurting eleesha. Knew i wasn't going to kill her, but it was just so Raluca couldn't make it to the bridge and say anything. What i didn't see was that i was injured. Burned Arms! Everything i did would take 2 more AP. Since punching eleesha i wouldn't be able to both spore raluca and transfer into her. So i pause in front Turret with raluca thinking. Terrance enters and punches me, im down to 1hp.</p><p>Time to run, back of the ship. All i can hope for is to waste some AP.</p><p>But what is this! They just notice the new Mush icon! They think i turned Raluca! Oh yes i shall not dis-abuse them of this notion. Maybe if i am lucky they will kill her in their bloodlust.</p><p>I die, Jin Su kills me in the Alpha Bay 2. Well good luck Stephen. You didn't do a damn thing all game but stand in the rear corridor. Mush Speed to you.</p>

                <p>Well that was well played Gioele and you benefited hugely from timing issues. But it wasn't a Mush hunt by execution, Chao and Stephan would never have been allowed to live if we were doing that.</p><p>From the start I was watching and logging all activity in both dorms for mush activity. I saw Janice get up and move from Alpha Dorm to Bravo with the Shower right after Mush were assigned which immediately put her on my radar. When she woke up a day later and claimed to be a first time player of Janice with 4th level skills I questioned her. She claimed all her characters started at 4th level and she wasn't going to report it as a bug because she liked never having to play low level. That's when I called the kill on her. Roland objected to it and said we couldn't be sure. He followed her out to the hall to see what she was doing and saw she had spored. He killed her proving he was human. Raluca got into the action but could have been a mush jumping in on a doomed mush which is legal. I was proved human because I called for Janice death even before she spored. So Chun, Roland and I started working together in earnest.</p><p>Roland and Chun and I began sleeping in Bravo Dorm so that no one else could legitimately say they were there for sleeping. Only real reason to come in was to shower.</p><p>Paola was twitching to keep her Comms title and someone said she should be killed. Several people agreed in chat that she might be mush and someone went and killed her so Eleesha could take over Comms. I don't remember for sure who that was.</p><p><strong>Hua here's your answer.</strong> Hua was the only person left in Bravo dorm. She didn't spend AP on anything but she kept takiing a bunk. She stepped out and back into the dorm on two days in a row. I don't know what she was thinking, but Roland, Chun and I agreed to green light her. Terrance came in and made the kill. Terrance then started complaining about it afterward, not Roland. Roland confirmed that it was a good call and if Terrance disagreed he should have done the killing. <strong>Hua, dirty status means nothing if your hanging out by the shower. I would kill you 15 times over for the activity you showed.</strong> You didn't contribute, you didn't communicate and you were EXTREMELY mushy. Don't know what you were thinking, but that was just bad play by you.</p><p><strong>Gioele</strong>* Roland had been pointing us towards Gioele, over and over because of the food thing. I started to listen to him now because Gioele had been so loud and then went so quiet. Suddenly Giole went on the move just before day change., Without saying a word he went to the lab where a lot of people were standing without a camera. I predicted that Gio was going to access research without the apron on so he had excuse to be dirty. Chun had been keeping us up to date on Research % so we'd know if anyone actually advanced it. I wheeled Terry up to lab, day change was coming and I knew Gio would be counting on new spores. Sure enough he'd accessed research without an Apron. We attacked him with the knife and <em>almost</em> had him dead before he could notice it. But he woke up at the last second and ran. <strong>That's when things went sideways and got crazy</strong></p><p>But he was our mush, careful tracking found both of them with only one other truly suspicious crewmate dead. I don't count Paola in that, it would have been mostly dumb luck if she turned out to be mush.</p><p>(To be Continued) ... here comes the part wherewe humans totally screwed up.</p>

                <p>So Gioele fled and Terrance started refused to help any more because he had to go to bed RL. Gio apparently turned Stephan *before* running but I somehow I didn't see that had happened. I don't know if it was my adrenalin or issues with refreshing or what. I would swear I waited to see where Gio would land and checked everything. But NOOOO...</p><p>I saw Gio was in FBT with Raluca and I ran there. I attacked Gio and missed, he fled and my second thrust hit the wall. That's when I saw the third mush light up. I swear to god and all I hold dear that it lit up right then... I don't know now if it was refresh issues or if I just totally fucked up. The only possible person it could be was Raluca. <em>I called the kill on Gioele and Raluca to the whole ship.</em> Gioele picked up on my mistake and started taunting me about being too late to save Raluca. I chased him to Alpha Bay 2 and drove the knife in for a final blow giving me more AP. Chao died of remose so I got a double dose of AP from my Cold Blooded skill. It was time for the sad job of putting Raluca down. She had been a noble and active member of the crew, I felt terrible.</p><p>Here's where I really lost sight of things. Gioele had never had opportunity to spike Raluca and if I'd had time to reflect I'd have realized that. But my blood was up and I had plenty of AP for killing.</p><p>I went back to FBT and plunged the knife into Raluca again and again, but she woke up and ran off screaming that I was Mush. She ran to the refectory, probably to eat to fight back. All I saw was that when she went in there we suddenly had a fire being reported in the refectory with her there. Firestarter skill I thought! But I can trap her. I ran to Central Corridor and took a guard stance. She came out to find me holding her there and started punching me, but she couldn't do much damage. The rest of the crew was waking up and calling for her death but my head started to clear. I argued with them for the next several hours telling them we were going to hold Raluca and cure her. It finally got to the point where I said "I am the Captain and I have give you may orders. We are going to save our crew mate whether you like it or not".</p><p>But Raluca was going berserk. I was trying to get people to heal her and me, but she was actively trying to suicide to prove she was human. She was obsessively picking up and dropping a spacesuit to injure herself. She kept saying that staying in the room with me would kill her by morale but wouldn't go back in the refectory to stay away from me claiming the fire would kill her. That made no sense because she was trying to suicide.</p><p>Then the cycle changed and Central Corridor was on fire. I asked someone to bring the extinguisher and put it out or give it to me so I could. I warned not to drop it without careful timing so Raluca wouldn't get it. Frieda just dropped it without warning and Raluca who was still obsessivly dropping and picking up grabbed it. Did she go and put out the fire in the refectory so she could stand safely apart from me? <em>Nooooo!</em></p>

                <p>So I give up and tell the crew to kill Raluca to get the Extinguisher from her. What does she do, this person who's still obssessivly picking up and dropping items hundreds of times to try and die to prove I'm mush? She says holding the Extinguisher is putting her life in danger. But she doesn't put it down so I can put out the fire, she disassembles it into scrap! Even though she thought I was mush, there was no reasonable rationale for this action. So after 4 cycles of holding her to try and cure her I gave up and killed her.</p><p>I was horrified!</p><p>She was Human.</p><p>Now I had no idea who the beta mush was. Gioele ran past too many people for me to. I went back to the Bridge where Eleesha was and wrote a long farewell to the crew telling them I knew they would be coming to kill me soon and apologizing for failing them. I decided to use my remaining AP to find the 2nd extinguisher for them and headed aft. I found it quickly, but then I noticed<em> there was a death announcement for Eleesha who I just left alive on the bridge.</em> The mush was afoot.</p><p>My scanner still showed Eleesha alive on the bridge though??? The announcement must be a false one sent by our neron admin Terrence. He had been in the room with me trying to kill Gioele before he suddenly insisted on breaking off the fight and running for the Alpha Dorm. I hurried to the dorm and Eureka! Terrance had been active briefly at exactly the time the false announcement was sent. BUT cursed Ian was in the dorm and I had only 5 AP left. No way to kill him. So instead I went on and put out the fires that had spread to 3 rooms. I was lucky and got them all out. As I was doing that I started to compose a second last message telling the crew that after they killed me, Terrance was the mush. Luckily I didn't submit it.</p><p>Because when I got to the Bridge, Eleesha was dead and the logs said Roland did it <em>while I was in the room before</em>. He came in and killed her while I was writing or looking at logs or something. I left without refreshing so I didn't see that it happened. For some reason the map was bugged and kept showing EW on the bridge for a long time after she was dead. What's more, right after killing Elly, Roland quit the mush hunting PM and the scanner showed him holed up in a CAT. Terrance wasn't the beta mush, <strong>Roland was!</strong></p><p>But... But... But... Gioele was never, ever, near Roland. Roland was almost the only person on the ship that Gioele *didn't* run past.</p><p>It must have been another crazy, insane coincidence. Roland must have eaten a spored food or touched a trapped shelf exactly when Giole started to flee from us. Nothing else made any sense. I composed and sent a third final message. I asked them please to look at the logs on the Bridge before they killed me to see what I said was true. That Roland had killed Eleesha for no reason at all AFTER I'd killed Raluca and that he'd left me alive when I was clearly the top mush suspect after that.</p><p>Of course they didn't bother.</p><p>I woke up the next day to find myself dead. Chun had rushed to the bridge and killed me without a second thought. At least, I consoled myself, I left them the information they needed to kill the last Mush. Roland, my number one friend. The man who'd done more to help me find the two Alpha's than anyone else had succumbed to them in the end. But it would be over and the last few active crew would be safe.</p><p>After being wrong about so much else... I had still never been more wrong.</p><p>(continued...)</p>

                <p>Floating in space, my spirit is unquiet. I cannot go back, yet I cannot move on with so much of life left unfinished and unknown. Eventually bits and pieces begin to come to me. I should have let go, I should have moved on... I ached for clarity but nothing comes clear in this nothingness. I can only glean some of the meaning as other wailing souls pass mine. It gives me no peace, it gives me no peace...</p><p>Roland is the first to follow me. It is as I expected except... there is no taint of the mush corruption on his soul. He was human to the end. But then why did he kill Eleesha instead of me on the bridge? He doesn't stop, he shares nothing with me just as he left our PM after he killed her. Gioele had run past Eleesha and struck her right before going in with Raluca. All I can think is that loyal Roland came to kill me and seeing the logs on the bridge, believed me and killed her. She could easily have been turned right then. After killing her he must have thought he'd made a terrible mistake and that I truly was mush. It would explain why he dropped from our PM and why his soul fled screaming from mine. I cannot know, I can only guess.</p><p>They came thick and fast now. First an old, cold soul. God only knows why they killed the old woman but she was crying and cursing the names of Chun and Terrance. Was her clumsiness with the extinguisher enough to doom her? She had never been near Gioele that I had seen. Following her were souls filled with despair, fleeing life. Ian, Finola... terrance. Terrance with the blood of the old woman staining his soul. He killed her and despaired as he watched her die. His soul more twisted than the body he left behind.</p><p>Then looming behind them a sluggish soul. The one we had been seeking. One who had never truly lived among us. Stephan the brain dead hulk with the taint of the mush upon him. They had found it at last after so much death. A spot of brightness on it, the last of Chun's light. Lost to the mush.</p><p>Then the last soul. The one that will never let me go to my final reward. The one that dooms me to drift meaninglessly through the cosmos forever. Lovely Chun was no more. She killed the human vessel that had housed the mush, but her light went out with it's unholy life. She wandered to the bridge in a daze, did meaningless tasks. Her mind disengaged, she worked on Communications that no one every heard. Scanned for planets now one would ever visit. Sat down in the Captain's chair and closed her eyes. She never opened them again.</p><p>She had failed.</p><p>She had failed.</p><p>She had failed.</p><p>There is no light in her soul.</p><p>There is no rest for mine.</p>

                <p>I am glad that things had a dramatic end there. I guess i was right about Stephen being useless, but it turned out to be the best thing. His inactivity made him a low priority. I gotta say I am mush again on a new ship, it so boring. I hope the new season breathes life into this game.</p>

                <p>Did you tell Raluca to come here and read what was really going on and share her story? I mean, I know why she was going crazy. But she went <strong>over the top crazy</strong>. Several people (not me) were warning her that suiciding was reportable behavior that could get her quarantined. Dismantling the extinguisher when the ship was on fire wouldn't have helped anything even if I was mush, but it certainly was playing against her team which is also reportable. I personally never considered reporting her since it wound up being so entertaining but it was some serious, bat-shit crazy stuff.</p><p>I loved it when I thought she was mush, it seemed like she was really diabolic.</p><p>I loved it even more when I found she was human. It really left me shocked and amazed.</p>
