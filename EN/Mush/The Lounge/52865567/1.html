                <p>Hello hello! Your mushroom shrink with an injured butt here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>I really didn't want to be mush on this ship because it looked really promising.. Just my luck to get selected. Always seems to happen on the good ships haha. Of course my partner was completely inactive too <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>I started out alright and spored Hua twice on the expo. I also trapped the nexus but unfortunately Gioele received that spore (you know, when he posted that he got the shield to 25% in three different threads XD lol) and then was promptly killed for spazzing out at Eleesha.</p><p>I went to sleep IRL and had plans of trapping the bays to turn Hua and then hopefully Roland because he had 1 spore on him. When I woke up I saw the list had been printed and I was one of three suspects on the list that weren't already dead <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">. It pretty much screwed my plans. Then I saw that a food test had happened (and possibly more would happen) and I panicked even more and realised time was veeery short. I had 2 options. Head to the refectory and turn Eleesha to mush by double sporing (she woke with 1) and then get her to go and turn Hua, or demolarlize Chun, grab the hacker kit and take us to Sol. I obviously chose option two and only failed because I stupidly assumed that I could use IT points to hack the command terminal <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico">. I should have turned Eleesha but I guess I felt like going for broke today.</p><p>I enjoyed this ship despite being a tad worried about screwing up, which ended up happening anyway XD. I guess I won't make that mistake again. I was hoping to introduce Derek to the world of love.. Janice style... Maybe next time!</p>

                <p>Eleesha here.</p><p>See? I knew my little plan would work. Hua rushed to prove her humanity by checking fuel to get dirty and showering and even though she could have been one of those pesky Splashproofs, she had never been dirty before so I gave her the benefit of doubt. And Terrence was there but not really and was actually doing his job so I figured he was still good as nothing he did was too suspicious. I that left Janice. Though I had my reservatioms because, in spite of my claim, Paola WAS indeed on the list despite being dead and I never expected both Mush to be on the list. But then again it was my first time playing Leesha so yeah.</p><p>Ship started off weird. Gioele clearly didn't like me as he kept saying I was Mush and kicked me more than a few times. That got him killed. I had spent pre-mush moving things around the ship so, when the ship finally filled up I was REALLY lacking AP&amp; MP and the Scooter was nowhere to be found. I got to work straight away and traced Raluca's odd movements after she got dirty eating. But then we had a bigger problem... Paola was inactive so I had to do comms work too. I was already starved of AP and now I had not one, but TWO AP sinks. So I ended up triple eating for AP and at the same time accidentally confirming myself as human. We had Sol connection issues and ups and downs but eventually, I managed to decode the say 2 base and carry out with tracking poleople down based on leads given to me by Chun &amp; Stwphen.</p><p>Eventually, crewmate for pilgred popped up and ship was way too quiet so I just took the risk. Traded Paola away only for her to turn out to be Mush. After that I printed the list and luckily, half the people on it were dead which left me with 3 suspects. It was funny messaging people, watching the noose tighten and waiting for our lovely Mush to panic.</p><br><p>Janice, you would have been better off converting me. Then we could have got Stephen and make a Mush Sol return xD</p><p>We could have lasted much longer if Sol connection wasn't done so early and half our crew being inactive :/</p><p>But it was fun ^-^</p>

                <p>Yeah I was strongly considering it but just didn't think I had the time to waste. Seeing as in your PM to the 3 suspects on the list included a request for them to prove that they were human, I thought they would come on at any time and food test like Stephen did. If I converted you I thought it would have taken time to regain AP to kill Chun and get the hacker kit (I thought you were pretty low on AP yourself, and it would have taken me 6ap to turn you, 8ap if I showered) so I just went for it. I would have waited longer if I knew food tests were out of the equation and used the opportunity to infect you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/keepcool.png" alt=":K" class="tid_ico">.

                <p>Alright, guess it's my turn to tell my side of things. <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/stephen_seagull.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_SS:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>From Mush selection I had a feeling that Terrence was Mush.<br>So I carefully watched him up until that god awful expedition that nearly killed me, after that, I was damn near certain that one of two who went with me (Hua and Janice) was a traitor Mush. (were you, by the way Pumpy?)</p><p>I apprenticed Pilot to get around the pilot lock in Icarus so I could launch the mission, which kinda stuck me in a useless spot later, as we only ever got one wave of hunters before going home.</p><p>I started a chat with Chun and Eleesha whilst planetside which eventually became the Mush hunt chat.</p><p>This is when Comms went down and I got stuck in the upper half of the ship trying to fix them, Gioele then started spewing that Eleesha is mush nonsense. I actually bought a proactive puff rice here, and could have easily confirmed humanity by not clearing my inventory first, but I decided against it because it felt cheap. Slapped Gioele to death with my fist, and then started that general pain thread a cycle later.</p><p>While I was asleep for the night Paola got canned, I became Commander and 4 people died.<br>Before I could move us away from the planet, Eleesha asked me to prove I was human so I could be trusted with PILGRED complete. (By the way Eleesha, had I been Mush, you'd have lost right here.)</p><p>Then Eleesha started messaging everyone with her "You are on the list" Schtick, Jan went nuts and killed Chun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico">, and we returned home Mush free.</p>

                <p>Orianna: I acted after you killed Andie which is why I thought you were low on AP XD. I was like oh damn she just killed Andie so is probably pretty low so I may as well use my AP demoralising Chun instead lol. Poor sweet Chun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>Darksteel: Nope, no traitor here! Just very bad luck. I first took splashproof and trapper and extracted 2x spores in the nexus and trapped it, then extracted another after that. I was hoping to get Katie on my side but crazy Gio beat him to the nexus <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">. Then I saw there was going to be an expo so I took Infector to spore Hua. I would have spored you if I knew you were coming on the expo earlier <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">. Then lastly I took Demoralize, of course.</p><p>Thanks for not dropping the bought item earlier though! I am sorry I had to rampage, I really wanted to give you guys a long interesting game but it was a bit hard with no help and when you guys started putting pressure on me I guess my nerves gave in haha. I was really worried you would notice my lack of AP early on when I took some cycles to come and comfort you. I was like oh god he is so going to ask where all my AP went hahaa.</p>
