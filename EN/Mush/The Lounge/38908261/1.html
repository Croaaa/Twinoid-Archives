                <p>Hello <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4257">crew</a>! I was Comms officer/Neron Admin Andie, and you guys are unstoppable when you put your minds to something. You know who you are.<br>So! The ship started off all right, going around, having expos, and so on, until Terrence died on the first expedition by getting lost... Despite the fact that we had the compass. It was then that Freida and I revealed that we had both been Cursed by The Random Number God in our last games... And it showed. Through a ton of bad luck, a mush rampage, and shennanigans, by day 6 we had four mush, all of whom were now dead, no techs, and six living humans. <br>And Pilgred was at 50 percent.<br>"It's impossible." the RNG said. "You'll never get it done. You're going to die by hunters, oxygen deprivation, or morale way before then. Look, both oxygen tanks are broken. Have 25 hunters. Oh, and you seem to be on fire now. Give up."<br>It's a good thing we didn't listen.<br>I have no idea how, but over the course of four days we managed to defeat a god at its own game. Four days later, Neron announced that repairs had been completed and Jin Su returned us to Sol right before people started dying.</p><p>It was a harrowing last few days, but I feel more proud of it then that time I made it to Eden.<br>I wrote a NRJfor the experience too! I'll link it up once I get home. I'm afraid the later days aren't necessarily filled, but whatever.</p>

                <p>X_x How the hell did you guys survive? Geez, you guys were pretty persistent, so good job! I kept clicking my account thinking "Okay SURELY they all suffocated on this cycle.." only to see that the ship was still flying. I wish I had waited a bit longer for Raluca to be online (Janice was taking a while to do the 3rd spore, so I sent her a lolzy whisper along the lines of "Shh little kitty and please try to hush, Stevie's gonna turn you into a little mush. It could be a minute before she gets in here, then you need to run to Icarus Bay they hold dear." ), but getting the three of us online at the same time was hard enough to do. I launched the attack from my cell phone during lunch break at work, so I was pretty sad when I got home and saw how quickly Eleesha killed me. Been a little bummed out and haven't started a ship since.</p><p>So yeah, my main plan was to take over the Icarus Bay then farm you humans for glory for mush supremacy, but it did hinge on a little luck, so I shared a backup plan with Janice and Kuan Ti before I died, which I guess they weren't able to do or they did but you guys managed to find air in time anyway: Change the Neron lock to Research, grab 3 O2's, and take off. We couldn't keep recruiting undercover because Janice was Bronze and she was auto-assigned Phagocyte and Kuan Ti picked Splashproof/Mycellium Spirit without saying anything. Something else that sucked here was that I implied I would be taking Creative early in, but as soon as I was assigned mush, OOPS! There was no way I could learn Creative because of the My Account bug, I was scared someone was going to figure me out fast because of it.</p><p>Anyways, good job again on surviving. You found air and repaired Pilgred 1% at a time, victory is yours!</p>

                <p>Ah, I see where your plan failed.<br>First of all, we were in orbit around a good planet at the time, and got plenty of air from that expo. Second of all, you relied on luck, which the RNG was mercilessly denying everyone. <br>And no, I have no idea how we did it either.
