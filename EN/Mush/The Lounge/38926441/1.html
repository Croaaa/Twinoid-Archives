                <p><strong>Ladies and Gentlemen, <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4220">this is the End</a>.</strong><br><strong>Welcome to Eden.</strong> <span class="tid_sideNote">We made it. </span></p><p>I'm your truly impatient Sub-lieutenant Andie Graham. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/talk.gif" alt=":mush_talk:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And I'm very sorry for Mr. Lai who not only failed to get laid once more as he planned but will most-likely get brutally murdered by his chosen Queen, Miss Chun for designing such a terrible frail ship.</p><p>The journey started quite well. We had some trouble finding our Mush Sample though. With me running all over the ship searching, while Mr. Rinaldo hid it in the front corridor. His dirtiness and silence marked his mush carrier a very short one. So we got our Mush Sample and a dead mush body to autopsy early on.</p><p>We somehow managed to <span class="tid_strike">slowly</span> do our research bit by bit, everyone working really good together (expect for the part where they stole my bed from me) we found our first Star Map Fragment and the Plasma Shield came into view.</p><p>So everything looked good - until we finished the MycoScanner and <em>Miss Kent found out about the 3 spores attached to her</em>. Being a very enthusiastic and dedicated lady she had been stuck in various unsupervised places - not to long ago, in the rear corridor. Not to long ago being approximately the same time our remaining mush decided to take anonymush. Hm. So did we have two mush, Miss Kent being on of them or did the mush screw up and fail to notice the effect of our lovely mushovore research?</p><p>It had to be the later as Miss Kent's body, unable to get ride of the spores on it's own, yet unwilling to accept defeat developed a till then unseen illness the<em> Fungic Infection</em>. We put her into Quarantine in the Lab while eagerly working on the Mushicide Soap. All along the secret mush hunt club, which I had the honour to be part of collected evidence against Miss Tomescu who had been in Miss Kents striking distance awfully often. I finished the soap on a make-it-or-break-it attempt to safe Mr. Lai from a lynch mob trying to rip the Apron out of his dead hands. And Miss Kent successfully washed away all those dirty spores. Next up would have been Miss Williams who somehow had contracted a spore aswell.</p><p>But it shouldn't be. Maybe things would have come different if we had taken action faster. But as sexy as Miss Williams used to be I think things worked out for the better. Miss Tomescu must have known that finishing Plasma Shield with her genius could not get ride of the suspicions piling up. She must have been under great pressure seeing all her work going down the trail when Miss Kent washed off her spores and Miss Williams announced she would follow the example next cycle. <em>She transferred.</em> Miss Williams having read up all about being a Shrink was of course not the ideal body to steal. The transfer was immediately noticed and Miss Williams old body including the second mush disposed of. I said that was a rather good thing for us. As Miss Williams now Tomescu became our new Technician and finished Pilgred for us.</p><p>The <em>bad</em> part was the<em> rising paranoia</em> in and outside of our little mush hunt club. Being unable to check the Tabularix we started suspecting mush everywhere. Saving a third mush would have been a perfect reason why the original mush inhabiting Miss Tomescu transferred into a Magical be-shrinked Miss Williams. <em>Now we know that we were mush free from that day on.</em> Expect of Miss Chun of course but that's some mind issue and Miss Kent can surely fix her someday. But while doing expeditions, collecting Star Map Fragment, brewing coffee doing research and patching up our frail Daedalus we the rapidly growing mush hunt club could not stop feeling their grip. An unlucky and a terrible bad expedition made Commander Jin Su and Mr. Archer our main suspects. Jin Su being proven human after some failed attempts to coax him into drinking/eating two things. And Mr. Archer on the brink of being executed by a bloodthirsty Mrs. Bergman finally openly asked to the table by Mr. Seagull. Then again, we the not so secret mush hunt club had a history of being more talk than action so he might have made it without testing too.</p><p>To get to an end and back to the title. Once we had our 3 Map Fragments the question whenever we should stay in space till day 15 came up. I didn't care as long as we could finish the research before we would task ourself with building up a new home on Eden. And the crew somehow came to the (mostly silent) decision to try and make it till day 15. Well it should not have been. Poor <em>Mr. Soulton</em>, up every night to look after our Plants <em>was the first to fall victim to the ships frail design</em>. Concern arose. But it was not until<em> the ship claimed it's second victim, Miss Paola</em>, who had been awfully silent ever since her mushified father was slaughtered in front of her eyes, that the infirm decision was questioned. On that note<em> I am glad the fires are deciding things for us now</em>. <span class="tid_strike">In my opinion Mr. Zuccali does not deserve the Day 15 achievement for declaring Mr. Soulton and Miss Paola to stepping stones for nothing. As we already had our Map Fragments.</span> Well - them not saying anything in our 'Eden now or after Day 15'-Poll marks them unable to blame us. Yet I feel sorry for losing them over nothing.</p><p>As I wrote this way to long (I blame Chun ^^) log we reached Day 14 Cycle 2 and the fire we couldn't put out last cycle spread to the Rear Corridor and Alpha Dorm endangering Miss Tomescu nee Williams and Mr. Zuccali.</p><p>I apologize for being very impatient, especially with Jin Su. But you being constantly in a state where we had to poke you to see if you're up and breathing was a bit frustrating.</p><p>Thank you everyone for being a great crew. (Except Gioele and Derek...)<br>Special thanks to the members of the secret (later rather pointless) circle. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Miss Kent here. I certainly had fun. Lovely report on the events, Chime, I really could not have put it better. Lol, our SMHC wasn't very useful after all, though I suppose I'm glad we didn't kill anyone. It was sort of fun being the suspect for a change, since I usually get dragged into the trusted circle private chat pretty soon into a game.</p><p>The only thing I regret was the deaths of Ian and Paola, and perhaps the situation with Derek.</p><p>Oh, and my frequent MP blunders, my high activity during the day makes me want to do things quickly when it can really wait a bit, or would be better by someone else.</p><p>As I said before we left, I am glad we were able to wrap it up before my exams started. It is a shame I won't be able to play again for a while, but I need the next few days to be free from distraction, my Psychology exam includes like 4-5 essay questions.</p><p>This was my first Eden win, so I am glad we made it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Stephen here, it was my first Eden ship, i had a lot of fun playing even though by the end i had incredible amounts of lag doing each action (due to the amount of messages xD).</p><p>I was happy to finally confirm in the end screen that we had no mush on board. I was super paranoid because we couldn't confirm if there was still mush. I even suspected Andie at one point just because of her/his dreams of previous lives <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway, Andie was definitely the best member of the ship in my opinion, i even learned all the characters last names because of her/him(I didn't totally understand why use them though &gt;.&gt; )<br>And btw, i was the one putting the fire out right before we finished, i didn't know if Jin Su would take us home soon enough and tried to save Raluca.<br>Hope to see you all(well, most of you) in another ship!</p>

                <p>Roland here,reporting in from the newly built station on Eden.</p><p>For your knowledge,Andie,I have been to Eden and reached D15 before.That wasn't for my personal glory or achievements,but simply beacause it was a waste to go when we still had objectives and the power to achieve them.About Ian and Paola,I never said they were stepping stones,that's just how you interpreted it.If we reached day 15,the whole crew would have got the rewards,including our dead comrades.So by doing it we would have truly made their deaths worth it.</p><p>Also in my opinion,the biggest win is not defeating the mush,but getting new stories to tell and new experiences to flourish.I only acted according to that.</p>
