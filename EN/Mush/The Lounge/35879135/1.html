                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2613">Here's the end page.</a></p><p>It was my fifth ship, I got to pick <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/raluca_tomescu.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_RT:" class="tid_ico">, who I'd been waiting to play for a while, I was the next to last on board... and I get selected mush shortly after. After having only Mush level 2 and having just spent 50 on getting Raluca to level 3. Luckily I had enough to boost me up to level 4, but I was <em>just</em> shy of Trapper, so I was in despair.</p><p>Turns out Frieda was the other alpha, and thank goodness she was active. However, turns out it was her first time being Mush also, and she was bronze and level 3. Oh, did I mention that Chun and Gioele had everyone working overtime getting anti-mush research out the door? Before I even heard back from Frieda, they'd already gotten anti-spore and constipaspore, despite neither of those being anything but barely started when mush selection hit. Did I say I was in despair? I was wrong. <strong>NOW</strong> I was in despair.</p><p>Well, I had a mushified <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico">, and Comms had been rushed too quickly so half the crew was lower than they should have been anyway. Once the inactives started starving, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico"> was looking dire, and people started asking for Schr√∂dinger. The first one actually told me what <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico"> she was at, and while I planned on demoralizing her at the end of a cycle if possible without handing over the <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico">, I ended up not being able to do that, but she died of depression a few cycles later anyway.</p><p>The second person, Gioele, asked, and I didn't delay at all this time, since I didn't want to cause even more suspicion, since I was pretty sure he already guessed something. Luckily the <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> channel alerted me to the fact that I'd hit paydirt; he had a spore. Also, the team was not anywhere near mycoscans yet, so we just had to be patient. And patient. And patient. Finally, we found an opportunity to strike on the bridge and, though it required taking down the camera, we did it. (If the humans didn't suspect Gioele after Paola ended up negative for spores, I have no idea what they were thinking.)</p><p>Gioele, luckily, had been <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> before, so despite his initial annoyance, we started brainstorming with aplomb. Having neutralized (well, taken for our own, really) one of the two heads of the human resistance, I felt much safer. Eventually we just decided to go ahead and finish up <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_pilgred.png" alt=":mush_pa_pilgred:" class="tid_ico"> as soon as we had enough AP, especially since Gioele knew where a tech mage book was located. Frieda read it, she and I relayed PILGRED while Gioele headed for the bridge. First mush game for both Frieda and I, and it turned out better than I could have ever expected.</p><p>Seriously, human crew, those of you who were active (modulo Ian and Hua) were fantastic, and I hope that we're on the same side instead of opposite sides later. Y'all just ended up with a good bit of bad luck that gave us just the opening we needed to turn things around and pull out the <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> win.</p>

                <p>My third ship, picks between Frieda, Finola, or Ian (can't remember the 4th pick). And I'm thinking I want to help out with planets. Not realizing how AP intensive it is. I'm like 4 or 5th awake, and only a few things have been posted mainly by <strong>Chun</strong>. So I set up topics thinking I'm totally gonna be a human. I log off and am gone for a long time. I finally come back to see I've become mush and have a ton of messages from the other Alpha Mush <strong>Raluca</strong>.</p><p>Everyone on the ship is awake and <strong>Gioele</strong> is heading the charge. CAMERA's set up EVERYWHERE! (Bridge, Medlab, Laboratory, both Dorms. I'm thinking welp, what now. Both of us being first time Mush, and having read several things on mush play. We decide to lay low for now and seem as normal as possible.</p><p>I was largely out of the Human loop, being a relatively quiet player, just doin my job. All UNTIL the moment of opportunity came. At one point Raluca did come up with a strategy to take out Chun, but that ended up changing once Gioele got cat spiked, and he became the priority.</p><p>When we were both ready, I left the bridge to extract a spore in one of the turrets, came back, took down the Camera, spiked Gioele, as Raluca came up to the bridge to get the third spike on him. We were able to cover despite Paola noticing I took down the Camera, since I had been doing (mostly) what I was supposed to. <em>And well the rest played out like Raluca stated above.</em></p><p>There were a number of things that helped us come to this win: The inactive or clumsy players, namely <strong><em>Janice</em></strong>, leaving the crew without someone to provide morale. <strong><em>Jin Su</em></strong>, a griefer who attacked me randomly, thus causing everyone to think he is Mush, throwing off suspicion from me the victim. <strong><em>Ian</em></strong>, being very dirty (forgetting apron) and being inactive.</p><p>Come to think of it, I never ended up having to take a Mush skill...</p>

                <p>Thanks! Yeah, I was really surprised about that also. A camera had just been taken down from medlab to Icarus to prepare for the upcoming expo, so when Gioele was on our side he suggested a cover story that Frieda "misunderstood" and took down the camera to bring it to Icarus, returning it once she'd realized her mistake. Gioele, who was commander at this point due to the apparently griefing Jin Su, then sent a mission to Frieda, who was stuck in FC and couldn't get back to the bridge (much less had the :pa: to replace the camera). Unfortunately, due to the radio button configuration, he ended up sending the mission to someone else by accident. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Poor Gioele, he was so distraught when he realized what had happened.</p>

                <p>I was Gioele. And I tried so hard to keep our ship together. Chun and Roland were a joy to work with. It really hurt to betray those two. Terrence and Paola did their jobs well. I didn't see much of Finola myself, but she must have been researching up a storm with Chun. Kaun Ti was fun when he was on- even if he forgot a space suit. Clearly, Frieda and Raluca had this mush thing down.</p><p>I had paranoid, solid and coffee addict and started off moving things around and pressing relays for everyone and being really suspcious of everyone. Chun was delightfully active so I was thrilled to check logs and report back to her strange going ons. We had 4 or 5 inactives, including Janice so that was problematic. Roland was new, but a quick learner and he got gold so we had a pilot.</p><p>So I info dumped to Chun, playing investigator where I could. Including Raluca hiding the blaster in the rear bravo storage. It had to be her, because she was the only one in between when I entered and left. Chun cleverly asked the location of the weapons after I reported to her and when Raluca didn't respond, I figured she was mush. I hid the knife in the same storage. I also hid our tech mage book in the front bravo turret (reporting to Chun) because I didn't want anyone wasting it, especially when I figured we'd have to take Raluca out.</p><p>But Raluca was helpful enough and all plans to eliminate her sooner took a screeching halt when Jin Su griefed. I was up in bridge, waiting for the day change so I could try and reconnect to Sol again, when Jin Su came in and started beating up Frieda. He said nothing and had left by the time I checked the game again. I got a gun and tracked him back to bravo dorm where I proceeded to attempt to kill him. Raluca and Eleesha helped soften him up. I held onto the blaster here out.</p><p>Chao's braindead so I'm captain and from now on, I'm AP strapped and my morale is terrible. I'm forced to go down and meet Raluca to pet the cat she's been hoarding and I get scratched. I figure I've been spiked in the face and I might have been trapped when relaying and I'm a sitting duck in a hall for a cycle because I walked into the wrong room. Chun's been on top of anti-mush research so I want her to rush mycoscan. Raluca's stepped up her game being helpful so I just play paranoid. We loose Eleesha at this point to fatal depression. We're starting to loose inactives. Raluca tries to suggest I flirt with her, but instead I suggest Roland as he's had min contact with her and is active. I figure we get mycoscan up and we'll have proof to kill Raluca and more time to get ap. I also want to figure out who the second mush is and I'm hoping it's one of the inactives, with so many the odds are in our favor.</p><p>Finally we're ready to go on our expedition. I move the ship and am waiting in the bridge (protected by camera) for the day cycle change. Plan is to grab my coffee and get to Icarus. My plan is upset when Frieda and Raluca jump me. I am still shocked they got a way with such a risky move. Paola almost caught everyone!</p><p>I take traitor for the expedition and it takes a delightfully long time to get everyone in Icarus. Kaun Ti's forgot his spacesuit. I go Mia immediately, Finola gets lost then found and Roland is beaten down to 1<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">. They come back for me though! I felt so loved and so evil all at the same time. I camp on a bed, pretending to be inactive until it's time to rush pilgred and jump the ship to sol.</p><p>Once we had pilgred, we ended with our <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> speech:<br><cite>Do not fear, humans.

                <p>Fun first game for me as Roland. Decided to pick up Gold and got up to Level 3 so that we actually had a pilot. I honestly thought that Raluca and Gioele were mush as they repairing PILGRED very quickly and figured they were just going to jump. But as it was my first game I wasn't comfortable pointing fingers at people that were so helpful. Never dawned on me that Gioele was converted. I probably should have suggested not going back for Gioele but as he was very helpful, even while being a Mush, I was worried that suspicion would be thrown my way.</p><p>When Raluca asked for help to get PILGRED going at the very end I was actually trying to save up points as I wanted to just go nuts with a blaster. Thought I would have another cycle or two to build AP as he was asking for my help. Sadly didn't have that much time.</p><p>It was really fun but sadly I think I'm going to shoot people when they make the smallest of mistakes now... Damn you all... Destroy my faith in people...</p>

                <p>Roland, you were great! I only asked you for help because Gioele left the engine room to head for the bridge for the Sol jump before resetting PILGRED, and he realized in RBS that he'd forgotten and didn't have enough AP/MP to go back for it. I knew it'd basically give up our game to ask, but I also didn't realize we had enough between Frieda and I to finish the relaying until I did the calculation in my head again and realized though it was really tight, we could probably do it as long as all the rolls weren't bad. Oh well, I hope we meet up on the same side on a future ship, which holds true for most of the other actives as well! Once I saw how well y'all were working despite the handful of inactives, my first thoughts were, "Why did this have to be my first alpha mush ship? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">"</p>
