                <p>Hai hai ^-^ This thread is about this ship right here: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9407" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9407</a></p><p>I was Alpha Mush Janice and Gioele was my partner. Truthfully, this ship was a weird one. Mistakes were made (especially by me because I'm a big klutz xD) and said mistakes lead to a massive change in strategy, but I guess we still won in the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>When I came on to see that I had been picked Mush, I was probably happier than I should have. When I noticed that my Mush partner was active, I was ecstatic. Turns out Gioele was not only active, but high level Mush too. So he took Infector. Since I was Janice, I had easy access to a lot of people so finding the two people with starting spores was easy. One of them happened to be Kuan Ti who had been idling in the Nexus for a while. The other was Roland.</p><p>This is how our lovely Mush story begins. I get up, planning to switch dorms, and stop by the Nexus to change the BIOS settings. I mostly changed them like any good human Janice would, but I never set the CPU priority on anything. So anywaus, I notice Kuan had a starting spore, I go to A dorm, tell Gio in Mush chat about Kuan. We start devising plan to convert him. Eventually, he simply goes in and double infects with Infector. That's how, 1 cycle after Mush select, we had our first beta. And he was a gold player too. All seemed to go well.</p><p>Shortly after, however, Eleesha(whom we hoped would stay inactive) woke up and started poking her nose around. So Gioele said he was gonna play the silent newbie and started touching everything on his way to Rear Beta Turret then just stood there. Of course Eleesha didn't really catch on and if she did, I have no idea if she at least told Chun. But then Hua started walking around and walked in on Gio who was still Dirty. She did call it in chat but she lost credibility when she also entered Raluca's turret.... twice! We thought we were gonna get away with the newbie Gioele act but that had to be half changed into a slightly different stratedy when our Jin Su decided kidnapping the cat and standing in AB whilst dirty was a good idea. So the crew killed him and Gio got the title.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gio and I were busy planning. We wanted to get Eleesha but she was hard to reach for the most part. Plus, the crew really moved fast, led by Andie the Polyvalent, and soon enough extracting spores took more effort. So Gio had to take fertile and Mycelium Spirit and had to change his tactics from semi-inactive newbie to full on newbie and even told Stephen he was russian. Ah Stephen, such a sweetheart. So anyways, the crew wanted Gio to move the ship and good old Stephen actually went out of her way (we later found out the player behind Stephy was female) to try and help Gio.</p><p>While this whole Stephen and Gioele "newbie" thing was going on, we decided to get Andie instead of Eleesha, simply because said Andie was really making a fuss and we didn't want him to draw attention to us. So anyways, on his way to the Bridge, good old Gio passes through Medlab where Andie was resting and spores twice. Of course, Andie moans about the visitor. About a cycle after that, I decide to go help with the Mycoalarms research. We were already halfway through Day 3 and ASG and CS were completed. Luckily, I had extracted the day before, on my way to A dorm and stealth showered there since Terrence was having trouble dismantling the shower. So anyways, I go in, relay some with Andie and then figured I'd do the rather stupid and risky thing of turning him to our side at the end of the cycle when he would go back into Medlab. I knew it was stupid, but I was impatient. So end of cycle comes, Andie goes in, I follow shortly after and.... I fail. I swear, I could not click on the damn Andie who was on the bed at all -.- so andie walks out, I quickly walk out and back in and Andie PMs me, clearly pissed and now distrustful. I quickly made an excuse about Puffin being laggy and Andie brought Chun into the PM and it got awkward really fast. So I moved back to the dorms anyways. By now, however, Stephen was clearly suspecting me due to a PM I had sent him earlier to test the waters with him. So he kept trying to trap me in A dorm. Funny enough, it was sort of to my advantage as Andie moved there. On D3C7, I finally got Defacer (was waiting for XP) and, at the end of the cycle, I boldly defaced and turned Andie. I did tell Gio how I was probably going to die for it but I wanted Andie to take the fall too if the Mush fell. Plus, we needed Andie to know where the alarms would be planted once finished. Andie came back on C8 and was only half surprised but tagged along and we made a plan to convert Stephen on D4C1 and just gag Roland and wait until someone noticed the Mush were actually acting.</p><p>We spent the entire D3C8 planning Stephy's conversion and we thought we had it in the bag but then Stephy decided to log in. That made it harder and we had a change of plans. It was time to stop hiding. We had Ceasefire and Andie had taken the Diplomat book for safekeeping whilst still human. And we figured we'd make Stephen copy diplomat for a 3rd Ceasefire. But Stephen now knew I was Mush and he tried to trap me. Eventually, we settled for Guarding RC and AB and having Andie extract in plain sight and spore Stephy. Then Gio would finish the job with double Infector.Stephen was fast tho and called it in chat that Andie and Gio were Mush and copied Shrink and started punching me. But anyways, 2 seconds later, he was Mush too and he too joined our cause. We gagged Roland and the big banter started in chat. The logs were there, there was no going back.</p><p>The story gets funny now as I took the grenade and a blaster from IB, Kuan Ti who had been inactive and had extracted a spore at some point came on at the right time. He spored Roland, built a second grenade, built Lizaro Jungle, grabbed the 2nd Blaster and broke a door. Frieda started snooping around and then Derek came in and hit Kuan Ti some (after a while). Stephen and I shot at Derek so he fled. But Raluca suddenly burst in, kicked Kuan as well. I was frantically hitting the Ceasefire button but it activated too late so Kuan was already dead and I was at 8 HP following hits from both Stephen earlier and Raluca now. So anyways, we Ceasefired and we were all starved of AP. We had all the weapons except for the Knife.</p><p>Whilst I was sleeping, Stephen managed to turn Roland too and, when I woke up, Gio called the 2nd Ceasefire. In the meantime, more people came around and we had a big banter party in chat as well as a debate on trading inactive Ian away or not. Terrence even gagged me and Gioele at some point and they tried convincing Paola who was a newbie to trade Ian away. But Chun was rather rude so Paola decided not to trade. We had planned to strike on C6, before Ceasefire ended. Stephen and I went to B dorm, I threw the grenades and we killed Derek, Eleesha and Chun. That gave us the knife and armor too so now we effectively had all the weapons. We stabbed Raluca some too and then retreated to the safety of Ceasefire. When Ceasefire ended, Andie and Gio took care of Raluca and Terrence (who had been hiding behind Ian(who luckily died at that cycle change from depression)) and injured and victimized Hua. The game was ours at this point.</p><p>I kind of wanted Paola on our side since it was her first game and I liked her so, after talking with the others, we agreed to bring her to A Dorm (Mush Dorm) where Stephy and I were resting, starved of AP. We were going to boost her Morale to keep her alive until D5C1. But she didn't trust me at all so she came in and just killed Stephen. Later on she told me in PM she regretted doing it since we deserved the win. By D5C2, Roland and Frieda had killed Paola (Frieda was human, just bored) and Frieda and Hua died due to morale loss. That meant we got to go to Mush Heaven.</p><p>This is the story from my point of view. I'll add a few words about a few people on the ship in a while ^-^</p>

                <p>As I said, I'll be adding a few words on some people now.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Gioele</strong>, you have been the best Mush partner I've ever had. Ever the optimist, you didn't even get mad at me when I messed up. You were the MVP of the Mush crew and of the ship. If anything, you did most of what needed to be done when it needed to be done. Your newbie act was fun to watch and your banter after we got exposed was even better. I had a lot of fun playing with you and I hope we'll meet again. Oh and blargh zhorg morph larlar. (I sure hope I didn't just curse at you in some fantasy language lol).</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Andie</strong>, as a human, you were annoying. I swear, you gave the crew like 4+ people to suspect lol. You even made us rethink our strategy and go for you instead of Eleesha. Heck, we even had a plan to get Eleesha out there and trap her and convert her, but then you happened. I honestly thought that if we left you alone, you'd find us out and eliminate us all by yourself. You made me impatient and forced me to act on impulse. Once you joined the Mush team, however, things became awesome! The whole plan to get Stephen was brilliant. You were in on everything as if you were never human to begin with. And tou had that Diplomat book too. Win-win for me, especially after I found out who you were <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cute.png" alt=":cute:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Stephen</strong>, you were the most annoying one to convert. By the timeyou came on, we had spent nearly an entire cycle planning your conversion. You were smart, I knew it from how you reacted to my "damsel in distress" act. But we never expected you to log in on C8 at all. We were goping for a quiet (yet out in the open) conversion after which we would have simply waited for the humans to notice that the Mush are everywhere. But you logged in, forced us to revise our plan AND copied Shrink xD would have loved a 3rd ceasefire <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> But you were tons of fun.... after you told us off some that is <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico">. I am sorry about you dying by Paola's hands. I genuinely thought her to be harmless. She did say she regretted it afterwards. I had no AP to even attempt to save you. Again, I'm sorry u.u</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Kuan Ti and Roland</strong>, you guys have been.... quite frustrating for the most part. Kuan, you were busy most of the time so we couldn't pin any major tasks on you most of the time. You did deliver towards the end when you came back and brought us a beat little arsenal to play with. I'm sorry I couldn't save you with Ceasefire x.x I tried. Roland, you went silent after a while, even as a human. The only reason we converted you was because you were spored already and we figured it would be fun to turn the whole A dorm into a Mush dorm. You came on briefly when we decided to kill everyone but disappeared as fast as you came. You did deliver at the end with the Demoralize skill and helping kill Paola.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Chun</strong>, you were active which is a big feat for a Chun in this game. However, you were a bit too salty for my taste. Sure, we used whatever dirty tricks and excuses we had in order to reach our goal. But you have to remember that the Mushes start at a disadvantage anyways and, when your own survival is at stake, then end justifies the means I'm affraid. Yes, we "cheated" our way towards our win by faking being a newbie and making excuses. But hey, it worked and that's that. You can call it the same as griefing if you want, I'll call it weird Mush play that got us a win in the end. And be less salty, it's just a game <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Terrence</strong> You were quiet for the most part but very lively and fun once you came around more. I wanted tou on the Mush team so badly, I can't even begin to explain it. I was rallying for dragging the game to day 5 and somehow convert you too. It seems it wasn't meant to be.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Raluca</strong>, you were quite new yet so much fun. I'm sorry you had to die. And well, you wanted to know how we did it, now you do. In truth, I would have loved a mass conversion of the ship and you were in our plans as well but a few mistakes and events forced us to change our approach. Maybe next time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Hua</strong> , you were the perfect scapegoat to be fair. Your actions were suspicious enough to divert attention away from our mushy deeds on more than one occasion. Thanks for that. Oh and your chatting was hilarious!</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Derek</strong> I'm sorry sweetheart, it wasn't meant to be.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Paola</strong> it was your first game so I understand why you'd be confused. I'm sorry we confused you even further when it came down to the Ian trade thing but I am glad you made your own decission in the end. We had a nice chat towards the end too, in spite of you having killed my Stephy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico">.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Frieda</strong>, you were an odd one. Nice banter and everything but you confused me a bit. It was like you were with the humans but not really.</p><p>I guess that's everyone I wanted to talk about.</p>

                <p>Wow, that was a lot to take in. Good job on remembering all the things. Even I don't remember some as clearly as you and I was the one making plans <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Yeah, well, first off naturally I would like to apologize to the human crew and especially to Stephen. I'm not going to make any excuses about the way I deceived the crew, since I know myself it was "unfair", but what I would like to do at least is to grant you a view from my perspective that will hopefully make you understand my reasoning behind all this.</p><p>If you look at my achievements, you will notice that Gioele is the character I play mostly (and Stephen too recently) since I do like to play sturdy, resilient support characters in all games. So from my vast experience from playing Gioele and Stephen, I know how dispensable they are, especially Gioele. Stephen at least can copy a useful skill to make the humans reluctant to kill him, but Gioele? You take paranoid, place your camera and then you're basically dead weight. Sure, he can be Astrophysicist + Caffeine Junkie, but that's just something for late game AFTER the Mush are dead.</p><p>So, that said it becomes evident, how few room there is to make mistakes as Gioele. Even at the slightest suspicion you get killed since your role isn't vital and even if you happened to be human after your death, it's just, meh, no big loss. So, after having become Mush, you don't have that many options. Plus, I'm actually a silver player and only take gold for really good human ships, so the options are even more limited.</p><p>Okay, that explained we now follow our example. I pick infector, convert Kuan Ti in the *Nexus* 1 cycle after Mush selection and hide in a turret, hoping to go unnoticed and not needing to talk at all since in Mush it's always out of sight, out of mind. But, as it often goes in this game, your plans are mostly foiled. Jin Su (who actually contributed strongly to the Mush win) writes stuff in capital letters, kidnaps the cat and flees dirty to the *Bridge*, announcing a SPEECH INCOMING ON THE BRIDGE. That, of course, got him killed, which passed his title down to me, which of course made it impossible for me to play the inactive. I was immediately bombarded by private chat windows, asking me to move the ship after Paola decodes the base. It was like standing naked in a friggin' spotlight, while 12 (16 minus myself, my Mush partner, the Beta and the dead Jin Su) people are watching your every word. I would have liked to see, what you, Chun who hated me for my deception, would have done in that situation. So, I collected myself, kept calm, gathered all my wits about me and professionally said "how work?"</p><p>That's how it all began. I was put before the choice to talk or to be killed, so I talked. And that, Chun, was actually the point where I could have taken the easy way out, rampaging, where you would have been the first one to go down. But no, I did not do that, I took the hard road. The problem was, having said anything at all just made it worse, since then people tried to communicate with me even harder, trying different way, one of which was (Terrence was the first to do so, I think) speaking french with me - that was actually what gave me the idea. I was simply hoping that my native tongue would not be spoken on this ship (I knew it was a gamble since there are a lot of russian folks around) and I would be left in peace. But, alas, there was one brave man (who later has turned out to be a girl), who took the responsibility upon himself to educate the uneducatable: Stephen.</p><p>I'll post that first, to check if there is a character limit...</p>

                <p>Part 2, take 2 (thanks, whoever designed that forum)</p><p>Okay, well, Stephen. Stephen had the patience of friggin' Mount Everest. No matter how newbish I tried to appear, no matter how much I tried to "misunderstand" the things he told me, he stayed calm, reserved, and continued to explain the game to me. Trying to be as much of a pain in the ass as possible, at one point I told him in russian "here's a cool big cannon, but I can't shoot anyone <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">" (I was standing in Rear Bravo turret). I could feel the rage emanating from Stephen, but nope, instead via google translate he thoroughly explained to me, how inefficient it is to use turrets to deal with hunters. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> That, in return, began to vex me greatly bringing me closer and closer to the point where I would snap and go yolo. Then he even told me to message a certain community member, who speaks russian and could explain the game to me.</p><p>Again, I was put before a tough choice. If I didn't message the person, it would be suspicious and get me killed and if I did message the person, (also a she) she would check out my profile and see that I have been on over 150 ships, tell that to Stephen, which again, would get me killed. A lose-lose situation and it looked like Stephen finally won. But, this is not where it ended as you know from Janice's post. My decision was to be honest with the person I messaged. I explained to her the whole situation and on how I'm now trapped and asked her not to sell me out. To my own surprise, she found the whole situation rather funny and decided to help me. I have no idea what the two wrote to each other during and after the "reveal", but I would love to see that as I'm pretty sure it's also hilarious.</p><p>At this point it looked like I was in a solid position to get "mistakes" forgiven, so I tried to cooperate as much as I could all the while do Mushy deeds. Oh, so you want me to move the ship? Sure thing! I'll just go ahead to the Bridge through the Medlab, eat a random pill and spike Andie twice in the process. There we go, now how do I move that damn thing? After that, Stephen stopped to communicate me, though and I felt the noose around my neck tightening once again. But, the tide turned again when Janice then managed to finish Andie's conversion right in the dorm, using defacer. I told her it wouldn't go unnoticed, but luckily she didn't listen to me. 4 people in that dorm were now Mush, Roland pretty much inactive and Stephen was our next target, so he can stay in the dorm. I would like to know what they were chatting about in the human chat at this point since it was obvious that someone was converted.</p><p>Now it was about planning with Andie and Janice to convert Stephen. Kuan Ti was inactive most of the time, so it was up to us three. There were now 2 factors, that helped us greatly to do that. The first one was that Janice granted me 7 gold days (thanks again <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico">), allowing me to get a free spore. Oh, you want to know the second one? Remember how I mentioned, that Jin Su helped the Mush win? Well, what I meant was that that fool actually gave me a mission before he died. I have absolutely no idea why he did so, it made no sense whatsoever, but yes, I still had the previous commander's mission in my pocket to convert Stephen.</p><p>The problem was, that Stephen was jumpy. I still was in a chat window with him and his status was either "online" or "recent". I basically knew, that once the cycle turns, he will be gone like the wind within mere seconds. That is when I proposed guarding Alpha Bay and Rear Corridor. Yes, it was more complicated that simply putting the spores onto him, but I doubt we would have gotten him otherwise. Andie came to the rescue through, and simplified the plan for the already nervous Janice to understand and execute. Shortly before cycle change I made my way to Alpha Bay and guarded. Simultaneously Janice left the dorm to Rear Corridor and guarded there. Stephen could not escape, we converted him. He gave alarm before being turned, but that didn't matter, we were now 5 Mush with 2 ceasefires (were hoping for a third from Stephen apprenticing it from Janice, but he played correctly as human and copied her shrink skill before trying to hurt her). But here's another thing, Stephen. You had Solid! Think about that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Well, you know the rest from Janice's post. Writing the whole bunch a second time was really annoying but I hope I still got most of what I wanted to say out.</p><p>In retrospect, it was a very difficult ship to deal with as Mush. It had all manners of active and experienced people, including an active Chun and Eleesha, so I doubt we would have managed to pull off a Mush win if not for sinister tactics. I'm sorry for doing it the way I did it, but hey, Mush is just a game, and lying, cheating and deceiving as Mush to survive is part of it. Don't hate the player, hate the game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> No, actually, don't hate it, it's great <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Just don't hate at all and have a good chuckle instead.</p><p>Greetz,<br>res7less</p>

                <p>Yeah, in a vacuum that would be a good tactic. Mush is indeed about deception, and it sounds like you played your part convincingly. The <em>problem</em> with that particular strategy is, it tends to cause people to be skeptical of newbies and non-native English speakers. This is not an easy game and there is a lot of meta for new players to learn. They really do need helpful crewmates to get on track. If this support system disappears due to overuse of the Mush "newbie" tactic, it could kill the game altogether by being too harsh on the fresh blood it depends on.</p><p>So hopefully you understand the reason for being told off. It's not <em>illegal</em> per se (at least, I don't think it is), but it has the potential to hurt everyone in the long run. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Also, this is the first time mush has won on one of my ships and it was very memorable.</cite><p>Well, I'm certainly glad you enjoyed the experience ^^ As I said, if Stephen didn't come online when he did, his conversion would have been a silent one and then we would have kept converting people. But she came on, she noticed the defacer, knew it had to be me who did it and, not only did she blow the horn on us, she also tried setting a trap to kill me xD so all in all, we had 2 choices: purposely follow Stephen and get myself killed or convert her out in the open and pretty much expose ourselves and declare war on the humans. And to be fair, if Stephen asn't as quick as she was with ysing apprentice, we would have had a 3rd Diplomat, just enough Ceasefire time to convert another person. But hey, the all out war option was fun too xD You should have seen our impressive arsenal lol 2 blasters, the lizaro jungle and 2 grenades xD All the humans had was the knife and you guys couldn't use it because of Ceasefire. To be fair, by the time all the humans died, I was down to 4 HP xD</p>
