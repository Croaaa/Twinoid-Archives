                <p>Allright people! We are talking here about THIS ship:</p><p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9155" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9155</a></p><p>I was Your friendly pacifist on board - <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"> And I must tell You that it was really solid ship that we managed to create together. Mush Hunt phase was fast and efficient - which automatically made less interesting than it could, but this ship was not about interesting Mush Hunting. It was a story of good crew with good skills and great activity that leads without any troubles (but still with some major mistakes! One especially big on my part!) towards finnal destination - Eden. But Eden is end of story. And I wish I could start from begining...</p><p><strong>Begining...</strong><br>This time I can start story from VERY begining of ship. What? Why are You looking like that on me? You think I always tell story from very begining? Than You are WRONG! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> No, no. Seriously - this time I can tell story from very begining only because I WAS FIRST ONE that woke up on board of this ship. So it started with me. I could witness how more and more crewmembers were waking up, how ship was being more and more organized. And I could of course "judge" every waking up crewmember in my personal "book"... And here was first VERY good sight for me! So... Few words about our great crew... Shall we? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hua.png" alt=":mush_hua_50:" class="tid_ico"> - very good and active crew member. Our secondary Bothanist and Pilot. Survivalist on our expeditions. With Her, me and Andie we were finding alien fruits on expeditions like crazy!<br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"> - our main investigator. She did really quick job on finding who our mushes were. Pure logic, no second guessing. Extremly metodical and active as hell. She also was main reason why Jin Su got inoculated.<br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico"> - not as active as Hua or Eleesha, but very reliable and dedicated to the cause. At begining of ship She and I - we were pushing research as crazy together in order to make things more difficult for mushes. Later She was most important member of expedition crew as Polyvalent Pilot. Very nice and pleasant person. I always knew I could count on You Andie!<br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> - our master Technican! As Phys/Tech She quickly managed to set up Plasma Shields and later PILGRED. After that She took refugee in refectory and was taking out coffie every single cycle. Extremly active and also very reliable person to have on board. Also She made sure that jorney will be very interesting for me by trying to give me heart attacks... <br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> - our morale giver! She did really nice <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> We lost Chun pretty early due to inactivity and yet we haven't got too much problems with morale untill moment when it didn't mattered anymore. Good Job Janice! Also She was helping with Her IT Points with research and Neron projects. Another dedicated crewmember, even if few times went into inactivity (hence Terrence was also NERON Admin from time to time). My only problem with Janice was when She started work on Armored Corridors when we had FRUGIVORE IAN and Heat Lamps were another possibility. Good that we managed to out-work that. Very good.<br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/terrence.png" alt=":mush_terrence_50:" class="tid_ico"> - our drone master and secondary technican! Thanks to You Terrence we had 3 fully upgraded drones making whatever was needed to be done! Hunters outside? BOOM BOOM BOOM! No more hunters! Fire in Engine Room? PSSSSSSSSST! No more fire! Engine Room totally broken! BZZZZ BZZZZ BZZZZ! Engine Room repaired! There was nothing Your three little helpers could not do... OK! Actually they didn't extingushed any fires but that only because crew was doing that efficiently. But I swear! They shoot down many hunters and repaired lots of things on ship! You Terrence was of great help for us <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Both - as Tech and as Drone Master <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/paola.png" alt=":mush_paola_50:" class="tid_ico"> - ahh! Our sweet Comm Officer! You did great work and You got also very lucky with update projects! And what is even better - once comm work was done, You become our third researcher with Biologist! Paola! You were great person to have on board! Even if as well as Janice You did faded into inactivity for short time (hence Elemele got Comm Officer title for short time).<br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico"> - you started good by being active, than You went inactive after few hours... At lest we managed to sell You.<br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> - inactive newbie. Nothing else to tell about Him.<br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"> - evidently newbie, but uncomunicative one. Seriously, all crew tried to communicate with You Frieda and You didn't done what You were asked to do. At first She was scanning for planets and were reporting outcomes, but She never reported them to the point we could use Her planets! Either She reported only some zones, or reported all zones but not coordinates... Eventually She stopped to report anything and was wandering ship doing random stuff. Problems started to arise when She started to leach Paola's and Jin Su's Logistic bonus! Than She started to be actually net loss for crew. In addition I was honestly affraid that She might at some point hack into command terminal and send us Sol while we were still trying for Eden... We choose to get rid of You Frieda. I do not regreat that decision! I do hope howeref that it will be lesson for You that lack of communication MAY and WILL kill You in this game. That is all from me.<br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/finola.png" alt=":mush_finola_50:" class="tid_ico"> - FINO which is MINO and BAMBINO!!! Ehh... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> Finola! I miss You <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> Not on ship of course.</p><p>Allright. So... I am out of character icons. I will carry on without those than! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><em>Jin Su</em> - very nice person to RP with! Our Alpha Mush that got cured. And I am glad that it went this way as You were one of best commanders I saw. Always active by the end of cycle to move us if needed. Logistic expert definietly contributed to ship's high quality and finnal outcome. Nice and... That is VERY big plus in my book - sneacky mush! Even when Stephen died You still tried to remain hidden and was planning for something interesting. <br><em>Stephen</em> - not much I can say honestly. You were cought too fast to provide me with any kind of expirience apart of fact that You seemed like a nice and funny person. I did liked You for sure <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br><em>Gioele</em> - another grand factory (after me) of AP for our ship! Great peson to have on board, our main scanner (He took gold days especially to be able to scan those planets as Astro!!!) and... Hard to tell what Gioele was NOT doing. He was healing us around, He got rid of problematic Frieda, he was Role Playing like crazy (positivly!!!).... Without You we would not be able to land on Eden. That is for sure!<br><em>Derek</em> - helpful, nice, usefull, reliable person on board. Not much interaction I had with You, but what I did had was good expirience. Rather silent guy.<br><em>Roland</em> - simmilar to Derek in my opinion. Nice, usefull, helpfull and reliable. Bonus points for being newbie! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> You did Your job greatly as I do not remember any problems with hunters that we could have <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Seriously - You stick to Your job and by doing that You helped a lot! Great Job Roland! I do hope You enjoyed game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>That is about our crew from my point of view <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But there is another question - how did jorney went? Well... Honestly that is question to Jin Su and Eleesha mostly as those two saw two diffrent, most important perspectives of this ship. That is Mush Hunt and Mush activity.</p>

                <p><strong>First post-mush selection activity...</strong><br>So... Mushes are choosen and I am reliefed as I am not mush. It was important for me to NOT be mush as I really wanted to check out how good Frugivore is... Well... I could do just that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> It is GREAT! But later about that - now let's talk about what was going on ship right after mush selection. Well... Eleesha found out Mush Sample and brought that into Lab which made me give Her small amount of trust. After all She could have just hide it away to stall research. Andie and I (together with Eleesha) decided that we must quickly push research as good as possible and so we met in Lab and worked on it really hard. I had easier job as plants were not only easy to take care off, but also Hua was of great help in garden and was doing half of whole work with plants <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> That directly influenced my ability to work with Andie on research and that affected Mush Hunt. Also our Eleesha quite quickly noticed that both I and Andie must be hummans due to amounts of AP we put into research at some point. And after that I was informed by Her about Her suspects and who else was comfirmed humman in what way.</p><p><strong>First Mush Down</strong><br>I can not tell too much here... I woke up early at the morning and went to work, when I camed back I saw that we have one dead mush already. Well... From what I have learned He was cought on infecting cat. Eleesha just metodically eliminated one suspect after another by counting AP, checking who hugged cat and who had acces to any of both dorms... WHY?! OF course! I forgot to tell! For some reasons this ship had BOTH SHOWERS for few first days! And no Sofa! So... Consider that to be one of major mistakes of this ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> No Sofa for Paola and both showers working for some time after mush selection. Nice one, eh? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But that didn't saved Stephen - He was found out to be quilty and hunted down by Terrence. Terrence got mental illnes and was comfirmed to be humman. That is how ended adventure with Mr. Cat. Mushes! Seriously - stay away from cats! Like always! Nothing good out of it and kitten will be angry!</p><p><strong>Can I trust Elemele?</strong><br>After first Mush was down, it took some time to find out who was our second Alpha... In the mean time I started to worry about Eleesha. My point was that I should not blindly trust her. After all... Well... She was NOT comfirmed by any way. What have I done? I opened channel with everybody who got comfirmed by Eleesha and asked one single question - does anybody has any proof that we can trust Eleesha? It took around one day to get possitive reply from Terrence - person who was mentally ill. And after that I knew I can put my trust into Eleesha.</p><p>What was I planning? At this stage Eleesha was pretty sure that Jin Su is our second Alpha Mush. She wanted me and Andie to research RFS so JS can be cured. I plannet to quickly grab RFS and inoculate Eleesha should I not get comfirmation that She is humman. If She would be faster and would grab RFS and used in on JS and JS would be humman - I would try to talk others into killing Eleesha after She would claimed that "List is unprintable" (of course if She would not get comfirmed by other means like illnes for example). But that was not the case - Terrence counted Her AP and comfirmed Elee to be humman. And that was all I needed to give Her trust.</p><p><strong>Welcome back Commander!</strong><br>Together with Eleesha and Andie we managed to research whole RFS within one cycle, Eleesha quickly took it and inoculated Jin Su. With great relief, when I double checked on Him I saw that he lost His skills. Soon after that He acknowledged that He indeed was Mush and that there are no more Mushes on board. We were officially Mush Free from that point onward! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Not much story in all of this - I know! But Ian is such character that rather exist away from this kind of affairs. I will put in more story later today or at evening tommorow. We will see how it will go <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> For now You have what I wrote <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Once because of loading fuel, once because of eating while piloting... unavoidable stuff, mostly. Eventually, Ian asked me to take a bed in AD instead. So I did that... <br>....and the very next day, I got dirty eating in space again. Whoops. Back to BD.</p><p>Therefore, one person who definitely has my gratitude is Eleesha!

                <p>Hello, <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"> here.</p><p>There's not much to say about mush hunt, it was quite short. Stephen practically outed himself considering that the only 2 other persons who cuddled Schrödinger (Roland and Paola) never visited BD and AD before shower was dismantled there (it was actually 4 cycles after selection not several days). He tried to infect cat secretly in CBT instead of laboratory (claiming he forgot to drop him after relaying Lenses) but that didn't work out.</p><p>The only moment I got scared of mush was when Ian proposed Andie to eat rations to relay research (he brought rations), if he was mush he would have an opportunity to extract spores, shower in AD and convert Andie with fungal kitchen. I warned Andie but she was willing to eat ration regardless. Luckily enough she didn't move much so it was fairly easy to count her AP usage and she was still human after eating ration (as far as I know you don't get AP from spored consumable that just converted you).</p><p>Jin Su made a common mistake, he forgot to eat or didn't know when he would start starving. However at the cycle he woke up he grabbed coffee and a ration. I forgot to examine patrol ship he used right after waking up so I wasn't sure if he needed that coffee or not. I knew he most likely didn't eat his ration because he dropped it in IB before expedition. I healed him to maximum just when he would supposedly get starvation status in case he didn't eat anything or only drank coffee at the same cycle he wake up. I checked him right after cycle change and he wasn't hurt. I asked Jin Su to take 3 items into inventory and my suspicions about ration turned out to be correct - he was still holding it. That left 2 possibilities - he was a mush or consumed his coffee later than D1C7. I asked him about coffee - he claimed to drink it during D1C8 because he said he got starvation just at D4C8. That was his nail in the coffin - he was in bed during entire D1C8.</p><p>After that I opened channel with Andie, Ian and Janice and told them we have to finish RFS, preferably in one go, under 30 minutes. And as planned we managed to do it 7 cycles later in one go, Jin Su wasn't excepting it.</p><p>Also people who get dirty a lot usually aren't mushes, that's a common misconception. Most mushes try to not get dirty much to avoid suspicion. Most of the time they get an excuse to get dirty, extract spores and then stay away from dirty activities until they run out of spores.</p>

                <p>Hello everyone. I'm your loyal, ex-traitor, Jin Su <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/jinsu.png" alt=":mush_jin_su_50:" class="tid_ico"> . I was one of the Alpha Mushes, and my first time being <em>victimized</em> by the cure. I jumped onto this ship with Andie, who is one of my friends, I'm not sure if he'll post on this thread, but I told him about it!<br> Since Europa has gotten most of the story of the ship down, I'll talk about how it was like being mush.</p><p>When Stephen and I were selected as Mush, there wasn't much talking between us two. In fact it was small enough where we didn't even create our own private channel, we just used the Mush channel. <em>(Which I know is always a mistake, incase of Phermodem)</em><br> Stephen mostly did his Mushy things to himself.. So all I knew is he spored the cat, and chose fungal kitchen for his skill. <br>Shortly after he told me what skill he chose, he said he infected the cat, which, I guessed would of gotten him killed since he brought it out of the lab. The next day I wake up to Stephen being dead... <br>At this point I knew if I were to succeed as mush, it would be <em>hard</em>. I assimilated the spore levels of everyone on the ship. Roland, Raluca, and Kuan Ti (inactive) all had a starting spore. Gioele and Eleesha also had a spore when scanning the cat with mycoscan. With all this information, my initial <em>(lame)</em> plan was to kill off the two technicians, and just hope the crew wasn't dedicated to finish PILGRED with 1% advancements. I decided I was going to wait for Paola to get the magebooks before doing this plan, in case a technician book appeared. <br>As I expected, there <em>was</em> a Technician Xyloph book, and it was announced publicly. The simple fact that the tech book was announced saved Raluca and Terrence's life. Did I mention the person who <em>(from what I could tell)</em> was holding the book was Derek, with the hygienist skill? There was no way I was getting that book without killing him. <br>Mushovore bacteria was completed... I was confused on what to do, and paranoid. After that, I tried to stay undercover, and hope the humans would end up killing each other. How'd that plan work out? It ended up with 0 deaths, me being cured, and 13 crewmembers <em>(and 2 inactives, which died)</em> off to Eden.</p><p>Oh the Irony of this ship. I never would of thought my first Eden trip would be me as a cured Mush!<br><em>(Sorry for posting late, and any grammatical mistakes, I'm still getting better from my sickness <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> )</em></p>

                <p>Allright! And now it will be time for me to finish my little story <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As You could see now I made few mistakes - for example I greatly exagerrated amount of time we had both showers while Mushes already selected <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Anyway, our Eleesha did clarify that, which is good <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So... As You know, we did inoculated our commander Jin Su and brought Him on our humman side, which was of great help <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Crew Status</strong><br>We had dead Stephen (first Alpha Mush) and we also had two inactives (Chun and Kuan Ti). But apart of that everybody was alive and helping ship in it's goal. Well... Apart of Frieda who had to... Had to be taken care of. And Gioele, our Coffie Addict Astrophysicist just do that.</p><p>Moreover we had Logistic Paola and Jin Su... And I as Ian had Frugivore... And whole crew was active... In short - for whole time we did had MORE AP than we could put into work! And guess what? I didn't even had acces to Jumpkins - just some random alien fruit that was giving me 3AP while eating... But I had garden made ouf 11 Hydropots for most of time... We got unlucky once and lost two in fire. But than we just holded them in our inventories and never ever had to loose any hydropod <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> We had some minor problems with oxygene at ending phase of Mush Hunt - but with such garden and with one lucky exploration we managed to over come that problem easily actually <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> And once we got past it, we never ever get close to not having oxygene anymore <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Black Thumb Gardener</strong><br>Allright. Time to explain title of this AP Thread, right? I think it is right time for that...</p><p>So... As You know I was Frugivore Ian and I wanted to get as much AP as possible to keep helping my ship... Together with Caffine Gioele we could just do ANYTHING together - finish research quickly, do projects, scan for planets... Like everything! And so we were going on every planet with chances for fruits in team with three botanists (Hua, Ian and Andie). So we were getting alien fruits in alarming speed actually <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> But we had bad luck when it was comming to their quality... Not a single Jumpkin untill D11 I think... Or was it D9? I don't remember, but VERY late in game... But when we got I was happy as hell!!! I took it and...</p><p>And catastrophe! I wasted it! I missclicked and insted of watering I pressed "Transplant" and than warning poped up... But I automatically pressed "OK" which gave VERY, VERY BAD RESULTS! So I killed our only Jumpkin insted of planting it! That is why I used this title for AP... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Rest of crew was pretty much uneventfull honestly. We found first Starmap Fragment... Than second one... And at D14 we found third one and decided to wait for D15C1 for returning. And... That was it.</p><p>We also found 3 Jumpkins at D13 I think... Which was quite nice, but didn't really changed anything in the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Too late!</p><p>So... That is all story from my point of view <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>Hope You enjoyed it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">So, Ian believes that he "accidentally" lost his chance at Jumpkins?<br><br><em>Gioele chuckles</em><br><br>Not exactly. Let me tell you the real story. You see, it started, as all good things do, with coffee. Specifically, my coffee. I was on scanning duty on the bridge, my first cuppa joe in hand. When I took my first sip... well, let's just say there is a reason this coffee is a byproduct of the Pilgred Engine.<br><br>The universe opened up to me. The fundamental truth of all reality was injected straight into my brain... and that truth was coffee. Coffee was not a means, it was the end in and of itself. In coffee, we are...<br><br><em>Gioele eyes you carefully</em><br><br>You don't understand. Forget it. Doesn't matter. Wisdom is not for everyone. But I saw something else in that moment. An enemy. An adversary. A dark companion to the light of coffee; <strong>fruit</strong>.<br><br>Oh? You're laughing at me? Think about it. Coffee gives warmth, energy, it makes you fat; fruit is cold, consumes energy to digest and is <strong>healthy</strong> for you. And, as I championed the power of coffee, so too was there a dark champion of the tree-growths: <strong>Ian</strong>.<br><br>In that moment I knew I had to do something. Whereas I had had my epiphany and had come into my power, Ian was still growing in his. In time, the dark would overcome the light, snuffing it forever. I had to act. He had fruit by this time, but no Jumpkins, the core of his might and source of his greatest power. If he ever obtained any, there would be no more hope for followers of the power of coffee.<br><br>Every expedition we went on, I made sure to tag along. I tried to arrange little... accidents for Ian, but he was already strong. Stronger than I had anticipated. I shuddered to think how powerful he was going to become should he find any Jumpkins. In the end, I was left with only one option: I ate every Jumpkin I could find.<br><br>You think it is a coincidence that you could never find any Jumpkins, Ian?<br><br><em>Gioele laughs</em><br><br>Why do you think I was filthy from throwing up after every expedition? Those abominations were poisonous to me, true, but with the power of coffee I could fight back. I was stronger than Jumpkins.<br><br>And then, coming down from a particularly nasty Jumpkin-induced bout of nausea after temporarily having run out of coffee, I missed an expedition. And that's when I heard over the mindlink that you had at last found one of your precious jumpkins.<br><br><em>Gioele shakes his head</em><br><br>I was at the same time outraged and shaken by despair. Was this how it ended? Was this how the powers of light and coffee were forever eclipsed by darkness and fruit? No. It was not too late. But there could no longer hide and play safe; I had to face you directly, before your full power was unlocked.<br><br>I strode into the Icarus bay before you even landed. It was supposed to be my last stand. My final rage against the dying of the light and coffee. But then, as I grimly watched the Icarus touch down, something amazing happened. You see, I had not known this (Kuan Ti you magnificent bastard!), but the Icarus has a safety feature. All cargo is jettisoned before the doors are unlocked to allow passengers to embark. Among the cargo? <strong>The jumpkin.</strong><br><br>There was little time to waste. I stuffed the jumpkin into my mouth, nearly whole, forcibly suppressing my gag reflex at the disgusting lump of plant matter. I was lucky that I had just collected the most recent cup of coffee, straight from the heart of Pilgred, and I managed to wash it down before decontamination was finished.<br><br>I realized there was no way I could confront you in my now weakened state, but there was an alternative. Did you know, a Peniraft, bent in a very specific way, will very closely resemble a Jumpkin? Especially if it has been left to... mature a few days.<br><br><em>Gioele grins and takes a sip of coffee</em><br><br>It was me, Ian. I ruined your Jumpkin. I kept your power from you. Know that forever more, I will be your rival.<br></span></span></p>
