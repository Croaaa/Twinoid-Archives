                <p>What an interesting ship full of surprises and unexpected turns awaiting us at every cycle change. I was Kuan-Ti (Alpha Mush) and wanted to talk over and answer any questions to the lifeless meat bags floating in space in what used to be called the Daedalus.</p><p>"This is my spore and there are many like it, but this one is mine. Without my spore, I am useless. Without me, my spore is useless." - An Agent of Mush Creed. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>A short recap of events:<br>My real journey began after only a few hours on the ship when I woke up as an Agent of Mush. I felt whole and complete for the first time ever in my life. It was if I was born again... I wanted to share this feel desperately with all those around me. Everyone should know the joys and wonders of being mush. This was something to good to keep to myself. Lucky for me, Terrence was there and shared the same sentiments.</p><p>Operation Love and Happiness was now in effect. We desperately sought out people asking to be converted by hanging out in rooms without cameras. Unfortunately, the crew of 16 managed to squeeze into two dorm rooms and sleep on top of each other to be protected by the camera. New tactics would be required outside of direct sporing would be needed to accomplish the mission. Trapping would be our motto.</p><p>Our first near conversion began around the time of our expo. I managed to trap the shelf which Frieda fell for beginning her journey to a greater life. I quickly rushed in and managed to get a second spore in her before the day was over. It was only a matter of time before we could strike again. Our plan was placed on pause once we realized Frieda never left the bridge and since she was protected by camera, it would have to be difficult. We would have to wait to strike.</p><p>Our first beta mush came to us as Gioele. We managed to seize two opportunities where he was caught in a hall way unprotected. Our first convert was with us. He wasted no time in destroying the two fuel tanks and set the humans back many AP in repairs.</p><p>Our next plan ran afoul. On Day 5, Cycle 7 we were committed to a risky plan to convert Ralcua. All alone in her turret we figured she needed some company and become one with the way of the mush. Our plan was set in motion. All of us had spores and were ready to attack, we had only wait till all three of us were online at the same time. We were willing to risk the exposure of the Mycoalarm hidden in there, because the only person that would report it would be Ralcua... and she would be one of us.</p><p>The plan failed when Terrence took the opportunity to strike out at Frieda in the refectory earlier during the day. His tampering with the mycoalarms gave him away and led to his death. It was still a win for the mush since he managed to turn Frieda forcing the crew to kill her.</p><p>Gioele died shortly after... I never knew how he was discovered to be mush.</p><p>Down to my lonely self, a new tactic was devised (Credit goes to Cimanyd). Operation Fire Storm was put into effect. The plan was to hide both fire extinguishers and later during phase 2 go and dismantle them. I knew my actions were already raising the hair on the back of your necks so I decided to play human for a bit and hold onto the extinguishers. I managed to steel one right out from everyone's nose in the Bravo Dorm... I don't know how I managed to pull that one off.</p><p>I really did have every intent of moving the ship away from the incoming asteroids as I really wanted to see everyone burn to death. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico">Yay for fire!<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico">. It was just bad timing due to work. It was a great ship and I'm sure you guys can all fill in the details that I left out.</p><p>Just a few other things:<br>1. Nobody transfers took place.<br>2. Roland saved the day with the Alien TV. It prevented me from demoralizing people to death several times.<br>3. I was chomping down moral pills and rations like they were out of style.</p><p>Questions that I want to know:<br>1. How was Gioele discovered as mush?<br>2. Why did Jin-Su attack Hua?<br>3. What sort of things led you to think I might have been mush?</p><p>Anyways, great game everyone I hope you guys manage to catch this AP. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p><strong>Roland the Hero</strong>, here <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt=":tid_cool:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Hahaha I should have killed you instead of Hua... but she acted more suspicious than you <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":tid_innocent:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As for Gioele, Raluca checked the room logs and he was logged as the last person in the room when the tanks got damaged. (Btw AP wise it only set me back 1AP to repair those tanks...) <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> the one that pissed me off was the Alpha Oxygen tank...3 tries to repair it and I was hurt. Nothing a lil sleep couldn't fix.</p><p>Honestly, I didn't like the fact that after we kill Gioele, command of the ship would fall under your command...<img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":tid_confused:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But after killing Gioele there was only 3 people we suspected as the final mush one was Chao (afk mush), Hua (possible transfer), and you (reason below). But after Chao died Paola and I agreed on killing Hua next, I was still suspicious of you, but the reason I decide to kill Hua was because the cycle before I killed her, she got up from the bed, walked all the way to the refectory, drank coffee, and went straight back to the dorm to sleep <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":tid_what:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt=":tid_huh:" class="tid_ico"> Sorry Hua, but you would have lived longer if you didn't do that...<img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":tid_razz:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But I suspected you as a mush the day you killed Jin, you killed him too fast and when everyone was more or less AFK. I thought it could have been a plot to cover up the possibility of a body transfer into Hua. The other was when you picked up the pill I left in center bravo storage...and found out you brought it to the med lab and I saw the log in there that you took a pill, but still not enough to make me attack you right away just figured it was just you being selfish because everyone was afk/idle...</p><p>Anyway after Hua died I realized I made the wrong choice and it dawned on me that normally people would keep the pill or eat it but you knew what it was for so you brought it to the med lab because it was a worthless pill to you....<img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":tid_nooo:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So then that also meant you were not going to move the ship, so I just signed off knowing we were dead. But if you, had moved the ship I was going to kill you the next cycle. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":tid_happy:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway good job covering up your tracks. Well played....Mush.</p><p><img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":tid_youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Paola here.I figured the 2 broken equipment was the fuel tanks since it wasnt the oxygen tanks and since Neron didnt announce it i was sure it was sabotaged.So i just went down there and saw the logs and Gioele was the last person to enter the room<img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.At first i thought that Jin su was just being a dick and that you found the opportunity to kill him.I did keep in mind that a transfer could have taken place but to do that Roland and Hua had to have a spore on them and i was pretty sure that they didnt.But then Hua started eating like there is no tomorrow even though she always had a bed and Jumping into Roland sounded like a good idea if Jin or the other mush had managed to spore him once.Raluca was also thinking that you arent mush and that Roland was more suspicious than you so your name went 2 spots down on my hit list<img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I'm glad I was able to fly under the radar enough to not be your #1 target. Rule #1 is to always be less suspesious then the guy/gal standing next to you.</p><p>After reading about all of this, I really wish we were able to turn Raluca instead of Fredia. I think that would have been an awesome turn of events for Team Mush. We would have had an insider at that point too. I also had a saved mush skill ready to take anonmush soon as the conversion happened.</p><p>Where was the hacker kit? I was trying to find it so I could hack the BIOS Terminal and let me take off in a ship and watch the chaos from outside the ship.</p><p>I'm really surprised you guys didn't kill Janice off during cycle 5... right before the astroid impact. That should have shifted her duty to one of you where you could have turned on the shields. When I was at work watching from my phone, I thought you guys were going to kill me too just so you could move the ship. Lucked out there.</p>

                <p>When you pushed out the Transfer theory, I started whispering in Raluca's ear that maybe you were mush. I pushed the idea that Jin Su was mush, attacked Hua, then transfered into Roland to cover his tracks. I cant remember what you did Roland, but there were a few things I brought up that made you a little suspect. I think you armed yourself right after it happened, I brought up the pill situation, and I think I reported you being dirty or something. Either way, whatever I told her... it was enough to put some doubt in you being a human.</p><p>Plus I earned points with Raluca by helping build the Plasma shield and doing other repair stuff from time to time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>
