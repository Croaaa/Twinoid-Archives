Including most of our technicians and valuable crew.

Having to SHOVE berserk Janice into the hallway and finish her off, and somehow the mush sample getting stolen by who knows. We had an early advantage.</p><p>Everything was going decent until the morale started getting to us, Somehow managing to knock up Paola :/ (BIG MISTAKE) and not even being able to explore any planets. We were on a timed possible death.)</p><p>With around.. 8 cycles of oxygen left, We started getting announcements of people getting killed. Walking into the Alpha dorm, I witnessed my possible mush suspect shanking Eleesha in cold blood. Spilling the shittake like I had, I panicked and used my free shooting actions to put them both down.</p><p>Jin'su was innocent, Eleesha was the second mush. Since Jin'su didn't announce that 'HEY ELEESHA SLAUGHTERED A FEW PEOPLE' I was still panicking.</p><p>Now was just the issue of fixing Pilgred. I was the worst leader out of the bunch, but A VERY dedicated Stephen onboard took control, time who would fix Pilgred at what time, (He managed to get a technician book from Paola getting the DB).</p><p>3-4 cycles later, I was checking up on the progress of the ship at work and saw Stephen scream out "PILGRED'S FIXED", and sent us home. (Thank god Chao is second to get commander after Jin.)</p><p>Whoever that Stephen is, You're a hero and I NEED YOUR NAME TO GIVE YOU SOME GOLD DAYS.)</p><p>You gave me faith in humanity, brother/sister <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/surprise.gif" alt=":anim_surprised:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Aw, I feel touched with that message &lt;3</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/stephen.png" alt=":mush_stephen_50:" class="tid_ico"> Stephen here! <em>Gold days aren't exactly needed, but I'll always accept free stuff!</em> I usually find these trips much better than Eden ones, especially since we managed to salvage what one can consider a dying ship from exploding in space, but that's just me. Who says you need a perfect crew or a major mush win to feel accomplished? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I will say that the first few days were quite misleading as it was only inactive Hua on the Lab and inactive Frieda on the Bridge. I really thought it was a lucky active ship (with only 4 newbies) but everyone's activity just died out by Day 4-5. At least we got Plasma Shield up before our Techs went inactive. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Both Terrence and Raluca were already inactive when the killings happened. I was asleep by then, so I couldn't have done anything else even if I wanted to. After that, we were left with only 6 people, most of which are generalists, and no Techs to repair Pilgred with, We were gated with three things when it came to the time limit we have for Pilgred afterwards; morale, oxygen and hunters. I managed to decrease those 17 hunters to 11, but my AP proved to be needed somewhere else after that.</p><p>After all mush were killed on D7C1-ish, we had just enough Oxygen until D8C6(?). Our options were either pray to the RNGods for oxygen planets to prolong our time or slowly chip away the remaining of Pilgred and hope our resources were enough to finish it before Oxygen runs out. Before it all came to that though, Paola blessed us with a Technician Mage Book (and a Pilot Mage Book) from Xyloph. I was reluctant to read it at first as I was the only Pilot left, but there were limited options left; Chun has already read the Medic Mage Book so she couldn't, Chao obviously has problems when it comes to AP, both Ian and Paola were online for only a couple of Cycles per day and Sprinter Roland (who was wondering around) was still getting used to the game. Since time was closing in and no one has stepped up, I took the initiative and read it, finished Pilgred with both Ian and Paola, and got back to Sol with Chao ready on the Bridge.</p><p>Without that lucky Technician Mage Book, I wasn't even sure if we'd be able to complete Pilgred with only 5 people, since we'll only be upping it by 8% per person (4% for Chao) per day at the best case scenario. It was left at 34%(?) before our Techs went inactive, it would take us a day and a half (with rations) to finish it, but that is if we do not do anything else. While our Oxygen might be able to cope with it, our morale and Plasma Shield might not be able to handle it, so I guess we're also kinda blessed by the RNGods this trip. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
