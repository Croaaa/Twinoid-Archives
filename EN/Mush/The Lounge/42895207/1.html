Our Commander began laying down some pretty heavy rules regarding the shower dorm and ended up posting suspicions in the public, kind of entertaining but the ship was extremely paranoid at the beginning. I was calm and calculative, however, that seemed to work against me more...</p><p>It was still the very start of the ship. Mush were selected then Frieda makes her very first post of the game in the dirty thread, stating she got dirty eating in order to finish a planet she was scanning. Naturally, any of the bridge party getting dirty (especially so early) is a massive red flag. I head up to the bridge and noticed only one planet having been scanned and nothing prior, she didn't even finish scanning the planet until the very next cycle despite having eaten the ration (which she seemed to have eaten before having done any scanning at all so it looked like the AP was wasted regardless). I had Eleesha confirm that Frieda had not strayed to do anything other than eat, shower, and scan making things all the more dubious to me. I calculated her AP and even figured in a fail and was convinced she had not needed to eat that ration and had gained nothing from it. There was even a perfect spore shaped hole in her AP! Eleesha and some of the other crew were riding her in the public chat for not stating her actions prior to which Frieda had revealed that she had discovered a planet but not scanned any zones. To me, this felt like a desperate cover she made up because she knew she was in hot water so I threw that explanation aside.</p><p>I urged the crew that we should probably do something before she does any harm but they were cautious. They didn't refute my math but I don't think they decided to run the numbers themselves to see if I made any mistakes. I decided to let them wait, I doubted Frieda would do anything so risky again and figured that the inactive Terrence or (at the time) Janice would be targeted for sporing as a scape goat.</p><p>Time passed and we decided to prep to go to Frieda's planet. Roland loads 6 fuel faithfully... but... wait... We had 17 fuel on the status bar. I alert the crew and we just decided it was a mistake by Roland (he had initially asked how to load fuel). Later, Gioele invites a bunch of the most talkative/trustworthy people to a private chat and had noted that Roland did, indeed, load 6 fuel. The log also showed Kuan Ti entering and advancing Pilgred, also removed 3 fuel, attempting to sabotage our expo. Quiet Kuan Ti who didn't say anything. He advanced the incorrect projects initially and hoarded weapons prior to selection. The entire private thread came to the conclusion that he was dangerous, mush or not. We move and kill him. He was human but there were no tears shed.</p><p>More time passes and we discussed mush in our mush hunting thread. A lot of us were unlucky (or lucky, depending on how you look at it) and had gotten sick some way or other so we had a good deal of confirmed in the chat. I made it a point to keep a good chunk of them quietly confirmed so the mush don't feel cornered enough to do something drastic. I continued to mention Frieda but was passive enough to let the crew continue to stall. I decided to look at activity and noted there was a lack of it with Derek and Stephen.</p><p>Derek had been an oddity. He was bronze and the only skill he selected was firefighter. I was talking to friends outside of the game and they noted to me that having the "advanced Mush" option unchecked could cause a mush to be given a random skill at selection if no skill was selected prior (I distinctly remembered seeing a skillless Derek at the beginning). I note it to them as a possibility. I decided to continue to watch the public chats the crew had with him.</p><p>Jin Su had noticed Derek's lack of activity and confronted him in public about it. Derek stated that he was saving his AP for fires as that was his main job. People began demanding him to do other things. He was adamant about it. I opened a private chat with him and asked what was up to which he admitted that he was just "trolling the crew". I had already opened another lynching chat with people I trusted. Roland asked me to free a chat in public. I closed the one with Derek after asking him to stop and to help out (to which he replied he would if there was a fire). Roland had also started a lynching thread. I decided to merge the two. I felt Derek was human but was too much a liability as he was purposely keeping 12 AP for an easy Mush transfer rampage, also we'd have lost nothing by his death. Eventually we all agreed that he should die.</p><p>Raluca messed with him by saying she was in random places, asking him to bring a ration. He playfully decided to do as she said bringing rations to the random inactives that Raluca pretended was her as we set up our murder squad... Jin Su would open the attack. Derek was, obviously, expecting it. For the next 20-30 minutes I watched the blips of Jin Su and Derek circle the ship with the occasional third blip attempting to cut Derek off. Derek had picked up a gun somewhere along the line and spouted warnings to Jin Su. Somewhere in that mess, Jin Su had accidentally healed Derek when attempting to beat him to death. I was in tears from laughing so hard from that chase. Eventually they killed Derek, human, of course.</p><p>Janice eventually suddenly becomes active again and uses most of her AP hugging people stating she didn't realize she had even started the game. I didn't see much suspicious about it, to be honest. Most mush who play inactive are just waiting for a moment to kill a specific person (in this case we only had one tech so I didn't feel Janice was a mush).</p><p>((I'll finish the rest next post, I actually spent so long typing this that I ran out of time, if someone wants to continue the story feel free!))</p>

When we did not have any Starmap Fragments (or Cristalite for that matter) on Day 10, I was about to propose a vote to head back but then, the random Starmap from the Caverns happened, and it wasn't long till we had 2 Cristalite planets after that. RNG seemed to pay us back from putting both Fire Detector and Plasma Shield in the same set of projects for this trip. &lt;3</p><p>Fire Detector mentioned, I've never felt more lucky to pick Gioele as my random character. Who knows what may have happened with the fires if an inactive chose him instead? From what I recall, there's always at least 2 fires happening during Cycles 2 to 4 when most of the people are asleep or have used up all their AP for the day and have I not have gotten extra AP from coffee, I wouldn't be able to roam the whole ship <em>at least twice</em> the whole day without the Scooter (which I reserved for Jin Su and Andie since their APs are much more important). Sprinklers were also unfinished, so who needs Projects for fires when you have Pilgred-improved Caffeine Junkie Gioele? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I'd like to thank everyone for this surprise trip to Eden. Honestly though, I did not expect this luck when we had hundreds of Volcano/Seismic/Mankarog planets from Frieda during the early days, the lack of a certain important project, Janice's inactivity at the start and a Lizaro Jungle BP without a second Sofa BP. &lt;3</p>

                <p>Ok, can continue now.</p><p>Now that the two problem humans were out of the way we had to start to start discussing others. Eleesha had minor suspicions on Roland, who I defended based on the fact that the only evidence against him was his desire to load fuel (which wouldn't look suspicious to me either way since it needed to be done and we were having good luck on not getting hunter waves). I, however, went on about Frieda again. We decided to continue to hold off and lacked any hard evidence on anyone.</p><p>Eventually Eleesha popped on and mentioned that Stephen had entered and left Alpha Bay 2. An odd place for someone to visit, especially since we had just killed a group of hunters and were discussing scrap plans. Not to mention what I noted earlier about him being in the position to be sporing with the very very occasional relay on the projects. Also, much earlier, he had brought it upon himself to move the freezer but complained about AP. Curious, I went over to where he was moving the freezer and saw that he left it behind when he went for a dorm. He had solid so there should've been no reason for him to complain about AP let alone leave it behind to go get a bed. I don't like using Solid as evidence and I did bring it up to them at the time but we didn't want to move on it.</p><p>Anyways, with the culmination of evidence we decided to move on Stephen. Unfortunately, our actives tend to burn all of their AP frequently so I decided to put together a hit squad private chat of unconfirmed people which consisted of Roland and Jin Su. I trusted both of them enough to get them in on the attack. I decided to keep the name of the target out of it until last minute, to avoid any for-sure warnings if one of them happened to be the partner. I had to leave after I organized everyone so I didn't get to see everything play out, sadly. When I came back I noticed that Stephen was mush. When I read the hit squad chat I noticed that Roland had somehow guessed that Stephen was the target. I didn't take him as someone doing his own investigations so that bothered me but I just passed it off as him being suspicious of the freezer thing.</p><p>After Stephen was dead I managed to convince them that Frieda had to have been the second mush for the reasons I had been bugging about the entire game. We decided we would rush RFS and stick her. We rushed it so fast that it was done the cycle after we killed Stephen. I took the cure with the confidence of a cop who saw someone break into a store and run off with a TV. I marched my pacifist ass up to the bridge and plunged that needle as though it were Excalibur. I bit my lip as the screen refreshed and... She was human!...</p><p>My self confidence dropped to 0 and all inspiration and fun flew out the window with my terrible mistake. I cursed myself up and down while I apologized profusely to the crew and Frieda. We would have lost a human if they believed my idiocy from the start. Coming to find out, I was calculating the AP of the most unlucky Frieda. I was still pissed at myself, though. Yeah, I made a mistake and the variables ended up being much more common than I anticipated but I was angry at how I let that piece of evidence allow it to be enough to wrap a noose around someone.</p><p>They began considering more suspects, mainly the inactive Terrence who hadn't starved yet. I mentioned Roland guessing Stephen as the target but reminded them not to trust me because of my screw up. I then promptly quieted up and let them control things. I had considered closing the thread entirely.</p><p>Before we could end up moving on Terrence, Roland had mutated and assaulted the bridge, trying to kill poor Frieda. I felt even more guilty then. No only had I argued for her death all game, but also cannot stick Roland with the cure since I wasted it on Frieda (who he was attacking, that made it all the more odd for me). We ended up killing him before he killed Frieda.</p><p>I decided to drop my character entirely and just focus on the plants, I ended up getting really busy as the days progressed anyways. Eleesha ended up doing most of the botany work after I gave her my bed. I don't really feel I deserved this Eden Victory but I'm happy to see that so many could finally get there after so long. We did end up getting 10 pots of Jumpkins, though, with heat lamps! There was a debate between Heat Lamps and Armored Corridors much earlier on the ship. Many were worried of the plants burning but I managed to convince them to go Heat Lamps, boy did it help!</p><p>Anyways, it was an honor to ship with you all and I apologize I let my overconfidence blind me. Let this be a lesson, if you're in a leadership position, make sure you get as many facts as you can before dropping the guillotine. If the leader gets lost, those following does as well. I wasn't around for a good chunk of the Eden hunt so many someone else can give any fun details that I missed from that adventure.</p><p>On a side note: damn you Roland for hiding that apron! It looked like I took off with it and it was very awkward explaining why it was gone after I was the last one who touched it. XP</p>

I also played around with the idea of making a dummy hunting thread to pacify Frieda after we killed Stephen. Andie was a bit quick to invite me to it, though. Then Andie suggested bringing Stephen into it to Frieda so I had to cover by saying we were "about to make a move on the mush" so that Frieda (who I thought for sure was mush at the time) would feel like it's a legitimate thread.

Under normal circumstances your math would have been spot on. However, the number of failed scans I had this trip was unreal. Even when we were hunting for map fragments I saw an uncanny number of volcanoes and seismic events. We did end up getting really lucky on a couple expos coming up total roses though.</p><p>I kinda felt like I was in a strange place for activity. Most of the bigger bursts of activity seemed to come in at that weird 6-8am local time block where I was in bed. The serum-Roland kerfuffle happened about an hour before I sat down at my computer that morning.</p><p>Overall, a very good ship and I wish I had more ships like this one. After we were sure the mush were off ship everyone seemed to fall into their roles perfectly. Ian was literally turning out more food than anyone was eating, Paola had 98% of comms work done long before the astro race. Jin and Andie were the expo team of my heart. As soon as a good scan was sorted, we were enroute and planetside within 1-2 hours. A real well-oiled machine for a pubship.</p>

                <p>Glad to see you here... better late than never right? Initially, I did suspect you a bit. Form the outside looking in, it did look like you were stalling or dumping planets. But a lot of suspesion left after your first planet checked out. Even though it was choppy at the beginning, you did pull off the planets we needed.

                <p>Hello cedar! I asked so many people about what they thought about my math and they were all in that "Well... I'm not really good at math but it looks good. Lets wait, though" sort of position. I even pushed it on unconfirmed people to see what they thought (even the mush when I didn't think they were mush at the time, sometimes giving them information about their teammate could produce some interesting reactions). Not a single person said it was wrong but they were iffy. I wish I shared that iffyness. As for your first planet being correct, I've yet to see one mush Frieda get away with lying unless they had a pinpoint plan (which wasn't likely at that stage). Oh well, at least it all worked out in the end. It's kind of funny that Roland tried to kill you. You were public enemy number 1 for parties it seems and you never had a clue. XD</p>

                <p>If I remember right, Ral was already kinda provoking me a bit. I knew something was up, but there wasn't really much for me to do about it but RP being outraged. Since Roland was in on most of those conversations it makes some sense that Roland would go after me (though doing so instead of dunking Chun/Janice/Jin/Andie is a little strange. Hell, with how the astro rolls worked out, he'd have been better off dunking Eleesha since she's the one that got some of the lucky scans that saved us.</p>

                <p>Ral would've been the best target since she was our only tech at the time but we had Eleesha as backup. She had already said she would've grabbed gold and tech after the mush were killed. Also it was Eleesha who was pressuring you after it. I tried to get her to stop on the hunting thread because I was worried that you would do something drastic after you felt exposed. She managed to get you to say you had found a planet prior to the first one but never scanned any zones. This made me think you were just trying to cover for yourself.</p>

It takes a lot to figure out you did a dumb but still put the best interest of the ship in mind despite. I was pretty sure you weren't mush. We had a lot of confirmed by that point and your attitude didn't fit what a mush would do. There was no new inactive and the first thing you did was start comforting EVERYONE. Mush who play inactive wait for an opportunity to kill, they wouldn't just suddenly help the ship. I don't remember there being much, if any, conversation regarding you being mush after you woke up. Thanks for coming back and you did deserve to go to Eden. A few days is nothing.</p>
