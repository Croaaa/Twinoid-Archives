                <p>Heya all, mushy Terrance here.</p><p>From this game: <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3135">end game screen</a></p><p>First of all thanks to my partner in crime, Frieda. You were lovely!</p><p>Our ship was kinda doomed from the start it seems. With Raluca inactive and me as a mush the only technician, which made me the only one who could repair pilgred. So Frieda and I could have done whatever and won easily.</p><p>However since neither Frieda nor myself really were looking forward to be mush and the ship had to deal with some very bad human griefing at the start (Gioele first and later Stephen). We decided to go for a rather peaceful Mush victory. We wanted to bring the ship to sol or even Eden with one of us left alive.</p><p>I think we could have managed it, until Chao decided to roll the dice and kill two random people hoping they might be mush. The reason he gave for killing Frieda was that she didn’t do her job and thus had to be mush. Yes she was mush, but she did do her job, the reason she didn’t have any good planets to report was because she honestly didn’t find any good planets, she didn’t lie about that. We really wanted planets to explore to keep the crew busy and away from research/mush hunting.</p><p>After Frieda got killed alongside poor Eleesha. I gave up on the plan of getting an infected Sol victory. Frieda was the most fun player on the ship, she was most active and talked a lot both in main chat and in our private mush chat. We really kept eachother sane trying to deal with the fact that we were evil, which isn’t something we felt really comftable with. However with Frieda gone, I didn’t care anymore. The fun chatter was gone. The only chat remaining was Jin Su and Chao insulting each other. That’s when I for the first time became a violent mush. I trained demoralize and killed Chun on day change with it. Next day I killed Janice the same way.</p><p>And then Finola killed me. I hope she had good reason and it wasn’t a wild guess like how Chao killed Frieda. Well done either way. Since we had only 7 people left and the ship was going to die in about a day my plan for that day was to give one more player a victory. Paola had two spores on her from the very start of the game when she was alone and unprotecred on the bridge. Frieda was alone with her always so she could infect her easily and I went to the bridge to drop of the shower tube for the sofa.<br>Before the ship was about to explode I was going to give her the last spore she needed to become mush. With only 5 humans remaining I could even infect her under the camera as the few remaining humans couldn’t do much anymore with a ship about to explode and die from oxygen loss.</p><p>The main reason I wanted to convert Paola just before the ship ended and give her a mush victory was because of something she said about Chao. I copy/pasted it.</p><p><cite>Paola : Well, frieda was a mush, but the talkative kind. Chao was just a troll. If you ask me, i'd rather loose against players like frieda than win with players like chao</cite></p><p>I couldn’t agree more and I hope Frieda finds this thread so she can see this. Since she didn’t enjoy being evil, I’m sure she would love to hear that said about her play.</p><p>What is left to say. Thanks to everyone who did chat a a fair bit. Chun especially, you were the person I enjoyed the most on the ship after Frieda. Also thanks to the players who tried to remain positive till the very end. Hua and Paola especially.</p><p>As for the negative… there was too much of it…</p><p><strong>Most of the crew:</strong> Please do an effort to talk more on your next ship!</p><p><strong>Gioele and Stephen:</strong> I hope the reports we did on you griefers worked and you won’t get into a new game.</p><p><strong>Chao and Jin Su:</strong> Stop fighting like little kids!</p><p><strong>Chao:</strong> nobody likes a solo player, especially a murderous one that doesn’t even talk to chun before killing random people because you guess they might be mush.</p><p><strong>Jin Su:</strong> In your actions you were one of the best players we had, but giving a speech about how the entire crew is a bunch of losers isn’t going to create a better game…</p><p>All in all, my first ever time as a mush was on a ship that was doomed from the start, so I don’t feel like I did very much. However I’m very grateful to have had Frieda at my side for my first time mush. She helped me greatly. Thank you and I wish you lots of fun on your next ship.</p>
