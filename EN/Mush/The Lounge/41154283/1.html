                <p>Jin Su here.<br>Ok, that was a bit lazy lol <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Long Story made Short:</p><p><strong>Day 1</strong>: Game starts, crew seems active, we had 2 very succesful speeches in BD with 10 people in there + Bonus from comms so we are very high on morale from start.<br>Chun and Kuan seem new to the game.</p><p><strong>Day2</strong>: We set Hua to <em>Repair the Hull mode</em> until we get plasma (this was gonna last a while).<br>Andie gets the <strong>Firefighter Award</strong> for turning off the first fire.<br>We start working on research... that woudnt last for long <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> and the Mush Hunt starts.<br>From previous game experiences i learned not to trust Eleesha (she has never survived a ship were i was), so i started working with Chun trying to find them. Soon the Human Channel Has 4 Members (Chun,Gio,Hua and me)</p><p><em>The first Lead</em>: With Ian sleeping in medlab with no cameras, Roland and Eleesha pay him a visit, a few moments later we have Ian screeming on the chat channel about it. Our first 2 suspects <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Day 3</strong>: I log in to find Roland Dead, <em>1 Mush down</em>, Gio found him Dirty on a corridor and he didnt say anything about it on the dirty thread + ian thing in medlab got him a good beating by our coffee drinking machine. We decided to keep Ian under camera as we suspected he was spored at least once.<br>We started aiming at Eleesha and pressing her to colaborate on the mush Hunt with chun or any confirmed human. Until then she hasnt said much, And she spended the day on the lab behind Ian.<br>Gio had to leave the game for the weekend.</p><p><strong>Day4</strong>: Eleesha without asking the crew Prints <strong>The List</strong>, 5 names on it <em>Paola,Chun,Terrence,<strong>Eleesha</strong>,Stephen</em> Paola was working on the bridge, never got dirty, and had some progress on it, Chun wasnt, Stephen was innactive so yeah we wanted to kill Eleesha.<br>For our surprise Terrence takes off the Ship on a Patrol with no hunters and goes offline, We all thought the same, he went out to take spores on the patrol or got scared grabbed some things and took off.<br>We could have left, but we didnt wanted to lose the ship + anything he could have so we rushed Magnetic net, i moved the ship and went to welcome him aboard with 20cms of Psycopathic Joy.... He was Human <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Eleesha aiming at Stephen, but he was inactive on AB2 (got pushed there some time ago by derek trying to get him to storage). We didnt want a hidden alpha behind an inactive Beta (if he wasnt already) so with Andie we wanted to keep Stephen alive until we know what to do with Eleesha.</p><p>I get back and log in, <em>Stephen is Dead</em>, he was Mush. And we find Eleesha again on The dorm behind Ian, Online, so Andie talks a long way with her as we try to get Ian out of there.<br>A last chance to probe her humanity is given to her, she rejects it and when Ian moves is Killed.<br>Bad News: She was Human, Good News: We got sure Mushes were done, and Ian wasnt converted, oh and i got coprolalia (that was fun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">).</p><p><strong>Day 5 </strong>: We were down to 7<strong>o2</strong> or less (oxy ducts saved us several times as we got it soon) Frieda finds us a planet and we go there.</p><p><strong><em>A whole new story begins</em></strong> (Ship vs Explo)</p><p>1st explo: the pump Jams, 0 <strong>o2</strong>. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Day 6</strong>: Garden + Capsules + Oxy ducs keeping us Alive,<br>2nd Explo: the pump Jams, 0 <strong>o2</strong>. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/eek.png" alt="8O" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/mad.png" alt="X[" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> <br>Everything is left to get more *o2*, pilots killing, frieda and gio scanning, everyone else holding the ship together.<br>Gio Finds us our 3rd Planet , before going andie says <em>Third time a charm</em>. (i still remember that)<br>We get <strong>8 o2</strong> and <strong>Janice</strong> goes lost and Dead. <strong>She was holding the Drill</strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"> Andie gets a depression that would last until the end of the game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><br><strong>Paola dies from starvation</strong></p><p><strong>Day 7</strong>: The crew holding together. Kuan going inactive and back several times, almost not saying a word. <br>At that moment Hua, Andie, Gio and Me were the most active at that moment, trying to make the ship last another day. <br>I knew that Eden was practically lost without the Drill, as we had only 10 left and no Starmap. Andie never gave up on it (<strong>Kudos for him</strong>).<br>We find a new planet, 3 chances to get an artifact on it, Lady Luck was finally smiling on us?.... No, no artifact + <strong>Hua</strong> Lost and Dead <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> (we missed u Hua <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico">)</p><p><strong>Day 8</strong>: The ship starts falling apart, we had no myco, and the cameras start breaking down, doors jammed, and we start with "We dont need that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">".</p><p><strong>Day 9-10</strong> The tabulatrix breaks. Next Xyloph? yes, the 2 mages Books <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"><br>TukTuk our droid (crew didnt wanted to name it R2D2) fixes it. <strong>Gets the Saviour of the Ship award</strong><br>I get the logistics mage book and Gio the Pilot one, with pilgred done he was a Coffee Powered Machine.<br>A fire in the dorm (osciloscope + 3 plants burned)</p><p><strong>Day 11</strong> We find yet another <strong>o2</strong> Planet and go there just in case we need oxygen (we were afraid we were cursed <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ) Unfortunately we get 4 fires in a short time lapse, we put down 3 and coudnt find the last one (i think it was FBT, buth both doors were jammed).<br>At that moment we had 11 broken equiptment, half the doors down, 5 <strong>o2</strong> left an ongoing fire and all the crew out of ap.<br>So before the command console breaks down too, i pushed the big red button and take us back to sol.</p><p>____________</p><p>In the end, our score is far from impressive, research got left, neron half way and our explos were really unlucky. However it was a fun ride.</p><p>You get a very strong Group feeling after the Mush thing is ended with everyone trying to save the ship, doing jokes on the easy moments. I really enjoyed it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Thanks Guys</p>

                <p>Gioele here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> really fun ship we could have got Eden if the RNG gods had been on our side. Jin Su, Andie and Hua between the three of you you managed to do as much work as me and I was fuelled on coffee it was brilliant. It would have been nice if Chun and Kuan Ti would have worked a bit more but as it was there first game couldn't expect too much. I think Ian was overlooked on the summary he also did a very good job with the plants to keep us alive with oxygen. I look forward to being in a ship with any of you again.</p>
