How and when did you manage to get Kuan Ti and Paola?</cite><p>Well we chose Kuan cus he had one starting spore. So you remember there was a broken o2 tank? Which I am not sure but you asked someone to fix it? Well I knew Kuan was active around that time, I saw him even move from AD, so I gone to CBS, found broken tank there and reported it, gone to BB extracted and then BD, washed took medkit and when Kuan got into BB to go and fix the tank I walked in and infected the guy, 3 seconds later he left the room and I left for CC. I had low HP so I healed myself. The reason for medkit was simple since Finola asked for it to research it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>SO in same exact cycle scanner was completed alongside spore sucker we were sure he would find it soon so Terrence started hyping people to go to the expo with cristalite planet! We even infected the fuel tank in RBS for when he load the fuel again ((which he said he would do after expo)) So we waited and he got converted on the planet XD LOL!! Yet he was active to take anonymush.</p><br><p>That was for Kuan after that, in D8 I guess when bases were done and Kuan moved to bridge, I gone there, we removed camera and then converted Paola. Logs were staying there for a whole day, but we knew noone would visit that place. Funny fact, Steve was in next turret all along, the door to turret was broken as well so if he wanted to go to rear part he HAD to visit bridge so we planned and fixed the door, he left through there and thus never saw the logs. So It was far easier from there on, we planned it was time to rampage in D10, I even created a plan in which we kill 5 people but that changed.</p><p><a href="https://pastebin.com/Cdfs5VJ0" target="_blank">https://pastebin.com/Cdfs5VJ0</a> old plan <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>
