                <p><strong>I have to admit, my most recent ship took the cake as far as <em>memorable experiences</em> went. I want to share it with you all, because of this:</strong></p><p>(Please move this, if this is not the proper place for it. It seemed like the best fit, but I might be wrong!)</p><br><p>I choose to play as <strong>Ian</strong>, this time around, since out of the available choices, he was the one I had the most experience in and the most skills available to. It turned out that I was the second person awake on the first day, and ended up quite close to being through the entire day with only four-five people.</p><p>Also, I did my usual custom of posting "<strong>Banana Bread</strong>", as I always do.</p><p><strong>Raluca</strong> and myself decided to make the most of the first day, scouting out all of the items and organizing them into one of two inventory threads (We each created one! But we subsequently used the spiffier, bold text one). I consumed a ration in order to keep going, having made a wrong turn and messed up my <em>AP-MP</em> levels, and unfortunately, became dirtied, but otherwise went about business as usual, before showering in the dorms. (We managed to get the <em>Thalasso</em> shower upgrade, too! Yay for vending machines). All of this occured in or around the <strong>Day 1, Cycle 8</strong> time period.</p>

                <p>After sleeping it off in real life, and heading to work, I come back online while working to find that everyone has awakened from the bliss of cryosleep, and nearly immediately, the whole world <strong>occurred</strong> in my slumber. <strong>Jin Su</strong> had immediately assumed command of the ship and was calling me out for being a liar in my <strong>Banana Bread</strong> thread, which consisted only of the word <em>banana bread</em>, and that I was dirty and suspicious because I had taken a shower in the dorms seven hours prior...</p><p>...The same shower that <strong>Raluca</strong> had immediately taken an axe to upon becoming a mush, immediately after I went to sleep, in front of everyone.</p><p>Scrolling through the messages, I found the expected threads. <strong>Stephen</strong> reported <strong>Raluca</strong>'s mushiness, and the crusade began, culminating in the fungus' demise in or around the dorms. Some others were unexpected, as apparently <strong>Jin Su</strong> had continued his announcements that I was not to be trusted and <strong>Chun</strong> was close on his tailcoat eyeing me suspiciously. Especially after I had to take a second shower, since I forgot to put on the Apron after gardening.</p><p>This went on for a time, with <strong>Jin Su</strong> seemingly, relentlessly, after my head, despite my reassurances and the rest of my actions largely benefiting everyone around. Eventually, I earned the support of <strong>Terrence</strong>, and later <strong>Kuan Ti</strong>, who both appeared to be social and friendly once shown that I was dedicated to the cause of the Daedalus and it's crew. <strong>Chun</strong> eventually came around to reluctantly admit that I didn't appear to be a Mush, and <strong>Jin Su</strong> abdicated his position, begrudgingly, before turning to what I assumed was the next person he thought was Mush.</p>

                <p>Around this time, we noticed our first two (and also very important) inactive players. <strong>Paola</strong> had marched around the ship and idled in the <em>Laboratory</em> before doing nothing for the rest of the day, would not speak in the discussion channel, and made no efforts to set up the Comms (Which led to me taking a <strong>Twinoid</strong> and promptly being suspected for that, as well!)</p><p><strong>Janice</strong>, on the other hand, had stopped in the Central Corridor and never moved for the rest of the game.</p><p>Eventually, this became a problem, and the rest of us began considering ways of dealing with these two, as their titles were extremely important to our survival. As we were debating <strong>Paola</strong>'s case (We decided Janice was less important, since we could use the <em>Hacker Module</em> to change BIOS settings), I happened back into the <em>Laboratory</em>, since we had moved my plants there, and noticed a little gem in the logs:</p><p><strong>Gioele</strong> and <strong>Stephen</strong> had both entered the room, and began flirting with <strong>Finola</strong>, and promptly began to fight, with <strong>Gioele</strong> being the aggressor, picking up <strong>Schrodinger</strong>, and running away. Clearly, this had to be the only instance of <strong><em>domestic violence</em></strong> I had ever seen in the game of Mush. Upon his death, it turned out <strong>Gioele</strong> was not a mush, and therefore had either been the best roleplayer ever, beating a rival for the affections of "his woman", or he was a griefer, and we had to report him. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/surprise.gif" alt=":anim_surprised:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As we were all recoiling from the confrontation, our fears turned to <strong>Paola</strong>, once more, since the remaining mush had disappeared from the crew indicator on our Hubs. <strong><em>Anonymush</em></strong> we all shouted, laughing at the silliness of such a choice, before we attempted to verify whether she was or not, the plan being that she had to have some indication that she was a Gold player (Because she needed it to get the second slot!). As it turns out, there was no indication, and <strong>Chun</strong> attacked, anyways, but was unable to kill her.</p>

                <p>It was also around this time that <strong>Jin Su</strong> had begun his particular brand of "suspecting" <strong>Kuan Ti</strong>, because he had used a mage book to gain the <em>Shrink</em> ability, effectively replacing our inactive <strong>Janice</strong>. Supposedly, the argument started because <strong>Jin Su</strong> and <strong>Chun</strong> had wanted the latter to be the Shrink (<strong>Chun</strong>, that is), while <strong>Kuan Ti</strong>, and later <strong>Terrence</strong> and myself, thought that <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> had made the correct choice, since he was constantly near and in the dorms, and was a Neron tech, anyways, effectively replacing <strong>Janice</strong>, completely. The commander constantly insisted that he could be, or was, Mush, despite objections and resentment building because of this. Eventually, I attempted to persuade the commander to be less antagonistic to the crew, which... was foreboding, to say the least. <strong>Chun</strong> continued to back him up, and while the argument largely resolved itself peacefully, tensioned remained between the two parties.</p><p>The next cycle, and the <em>Lab</em> has burst into flames after the ship sustained hunter damage, burning a <em>Hydropot</em>, our <em>Mush Review</em> book, and breaking our <em>Lab</em> Camera, with <strong>Jin Su</strong> promising to use a mission to give someone <em>AP</em> to clear out the fire. After a bit of running, I managed to gather a <em>fire extinguisher</em>, and get to the lab, with exactly <strong>0</strong> <em>AP</em> to spare. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/oups.gif" alt=":anim_oups:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong>'s mission never came, despite multiple requests for assistance from myself and one from another user. Eventually, I picked up the <strong>Mush Sample</strong> to protect it from the fire at the cost of my health, and <strong>Terrence</strong>, who had been flying in Patrol ships to kill the Hunters, managed to come to the rescue, using my coffee I had left to put out the fire and fix the broken camera! Hooray!</p><p>Resting on our jubilations for a moment, we all enjoyed a brief moment of tranquility... before <strong>Jin Su</strong> came back online, and either through not seeing any of the previous actions or through completely unavoidable tunnel-vision, accused <strong>Terrence</strong> of behaving Mush-like and inactive.</p><p>It's at this point, I believe, that the <strong><em>Doom-Chord</em></strong> of the ship had been struck.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> also made another topic asking if I had been active and whether I was performing my duties, before also making insinuations that I was not communicating much with the ship, to which <strong>Kuan Ti</strong>, <strong>Terrence</strong>, and briefly <strong>Chun</strong> came to my aid and advocated my reliability and continued dedication to the ship, along with the multiple threads I had participated in prior to <strong>Jin Su</strong>'s arrival, to which he abdicated again.</p><p>Unfortunately, at this point, <strong>Jin Su</strong>'s post against <strong>Terrence</strong> had taken off, and flown all the way to the moon, with <strong>Chun</strong> getting involved at some point and taking the Commander's side. This led to <strong>Terrence</strong> becoming more and more hostile towards both of them, with <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> and myself both joining him in decrying <strong>Jin Su</strong>'s unwarranted accusations and heavy-handed demeanor towards his crew, along with <strong>Chun</strong>'s loyalty to him despite these actions. <strong>Terrence</strong> eventually broke, and dropped select obscenities, to which neither <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> nor I supported or participated in, though we did support the overall cause, which at this point had become that we did not see <strong>Jin Su</strong>'s, and to a lesser extent <strong>Chun</strong>'s, actions to be helpful to the ship, and found that he had not been accountable enough to his own failings.</p><p>It was at this time, amidst the arguing in the discussion threads, that <strong>Roland</strong>, disgruntled after never being able to find the <em>Medlab</em> bed unoccupied, and fed up with the crew, decided to grief and steal the <em>Mush Sample</em> from the lab, before flying out into space with the patrol ship and shouting <em><strong>Adios Muchachos</strong></em>!</p><p>We formed a group to attempt to combat this, immediately after I posted on the forums about it, and concluded that we should secretly pretend <strong>Roland</strong> had doomed us all, while planning to leave him behind. (The intent was to make him want to stay outside so we could leave him, and not allow him to come back inside to harm us further). <strong>Chun</strong>, still annoyed with <strong>Terrence</strong> from the earlier conversation, quit the conversation and immediately demanded, in public forum, that I drop the <em>Apron and Blaster</em> I was holding (I had explained that it was to keep <strong>Roland</strong> from coming back and stealing them, as well). At this point, I became fed up, and I declared that I was no longer interested in dealing with <strong>Jin Su</strong> or <strong>Chun</strong>, who refused to coordinate with us and held three of the most active and helpful crewmembers in contempt, despite only one being justified (Due to language and name-calling), and even that one was because he, too, had been subject to their heavy-handed accusations and, as they had come to be called, <em>Witch-hunts</em> that <strong>Jin Su</strong> continued to hold.</p><p>I declared that I was going to work on my plants, in silence, and dropped my iTrakkie, effectively cutting off communications except for those who came to whisper me. I still kept up with the conversations, for the rest of the day, by picking it up and reading through the logs, but I refused to speak to anyone about anything unless they were directly addressing me in a non-confrontational manner.</p><p>It was at this time that <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> and <strong>Terrence</strong> had effectively rose to challenge <strong>Jin Su</strong> and <strong>Chun</strong> over their leadership of the Daedalus and it's crew, with <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> insisting that the two take a more backseat role in the ship's operations, while <strong>Terrence</strong> continued to argue support for this cause, against their actions, and unfortunately, remained hostile, though he did attempt to extend an olive branch, once... admittedly with some passive-aggressiveness, which at this point was permeating the ship.</p><p>Over time, this resulted in <strong>Paola</strong> being outed as the Mush, and <strong>Jin Su</strong> being killed by <strong>Kuan Ti</strong>, in what was effectively a mutiny aboard the Daedalus. I never resumed communications with the crew, though I believe <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> had mentioned he was going to attempt to persuade me to after the Mutiny was a success. <strong>Chun</strong> had since hidden the Hacker module, however, and this caused us to lose valuable time in escaping the oncoming hordes of Hunters and Asteroids.</p><p>...Alas, we never had the chance. I appears that the dramatic clashes on the ship were insignificant to the universe around us. Had <strong>Jin Su</strong> or <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> prevailed in the mutiny, it appeared we were destined to be struck with so much damage in the next few cycles from Hunters, Aracks, and Asteroids, that the Daedalus was torn apart, unable to withstand the damage. We all died, as if we were just <em>specks of dust in cosmic sand.</em></p><br><br><p>...And then everyone had reports filed on everyone. And we're all being docked with SDF points, apparently. =(</p><p>The End.</p>

It was just the most dramatic ship I've ever been on, and I mean that in both good and bad ways.

                <p>I was Kuan Ti on this ship. Definitely backing up Silhouette/Ian's pretty factual account of things. Craziest ship I've ever been on for sure! There was so much hostility between both camps, with both thinking the other side was the one who caused it. I think starting a full blown mutiny is a first for Mush probably.</p><p>As Ian, you were a pleasure to play with though! Very logical and helpful.</p>
