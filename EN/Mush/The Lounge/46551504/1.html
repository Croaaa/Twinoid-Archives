"It is a bad day for humanity", he said, and I think that we all agreed with him. Hua had been mostly inactive and was Mush. Jin Su was inactive. Terrence was... not a pilot, for one thing, and was a total waste of space anyway. Frieda wasn't a pilot either.</p><p>Apart from the lack of pilots and a few inactives, the crew was mostly great, though. The lab and Nexus teams did a wonderful job, we never had trouble with plants, morale was fine because we had two shrinks, we never lost anyone due to injuries, even in late game. Special props to Stephen, who was almost a beginner and was a great commander, eager, active, always there to move the ship on time. We wouldn't have survived without him.</p><p>We wouldn't have survived without all the rest of the active crew, actually. Killing the Mush was fairly easy, especially Hua, who very subtly walked out of Bravo Dorm clean, did nothing, and came back dirty. Poor Gioele tried, but he was betrayed by his Paranoid skill that was picked automatically, by his lack of activity, and by the cold that I caught a few cycles after accessing the Nexus, which made me guess that I'd been spored by a trap.</p><p>After killing the Mush, we all thought that we wouldn't last long. The hull was slowly but constantly decreasing, while we fought with hunters and I frantically dismantled all I could (I even considered dismantling the drill). We rushed Pilgred as soon as the Mush were dead, thinking that we would have to go home in a hurry before we exploded. And yet... When Pilgred was finished, we went on rushing projects and upgrades, until we finally got Plasma Shield. After that, we finally managed to stabilize the hull (which had gone down almost to 15 at some point) and to survive until D15. We never thought we'd make it so far, and yet we did, and it was an amazing collective work.</p><p>Chun, Finola, Raluca, Paola, you did a great job until you died.</p><p>Ian, Janice (yay TE), Stephen, Frieda, congratulation on surviving and going back to Sol. And finally, special thoughts to Roland, who died of depression at the very last minute. I am really sorry for you, because you really deserved to go home with us.</p><p>It was great playing with you all, I hope to see you soon in another ship. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hey Roland and Stephen.</p><p>We escaped those 35-hunter waves, but we had Trail Minimizer and were well organized by that time. I think the worst time was that night when I thought we would never survive. We had about 10 hunters, Roland was asleep, Stephen didn't couldn't destroy the aracks or move the ship, and then he went to bed too. I destroyed the aracks and fixed the hull a little, but then I was out of AP and Chun was holding the hacker kit. We didn't have the right amount of fuel loaded. And the D7 rebel base was contacting us, but Paola was offline and when she woke up, the connexion broke at cycle change.</p><p>I woke up thinking we would be dead or nearly dead... and saw that fuel had been loaded, , that Chun had dropped the hacker kit, Ian had hacked the command terminal, we were in orbit of the right planet, and Paola had finished the rebel base in time.</p><p>That's when I knew we had a great crew that deserved to last much longer.</p>
