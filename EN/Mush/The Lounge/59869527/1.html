                <p>This ship was so close to getting back to Sol... and after selection being so late around Day 3 - Cycle 5 or 6...</p><p><strong>Roland</strong> here, and as the only pilot on the Daedalus with quite a variety in non-zombified crew members to bunk with. We had a fair share of variety, from a practically-new <strong>Chao</strong> who came out from the tutorial, a work-aholic <strong>Paola</strong> with luck deficiency, out-of-place <strong>Finola</strong>, Apprentice Shrink <strong>Stephen</strong>, well-dressed <strong>Raluca</strong> and a bunch of Gold players that include me, <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> the optimist, <strong>Ian</strong> our spiritual healer, <strong>Chun</strong> with Premonition, and eventually our only 4-skilled individual, <strong>Gieole</strong>.</p><p>I get out from cryosleep with an urgent job to attend to... which are the waves of hunters pestering the other crew out who can only rely on their pea-shooter stationary turrets. Gieole had to deal with these pests since the ship started almost 3 days earlier. The hunting down of the hunters and getting rest was my daily routine, and once the skies were clear, it was much easier to think about the interior of the Daedalus.</p><p>Mush hunting was something we had to place at the top of our priorities as there seemed to be little or no progress on the first and second days after selection. <strong>Finola</strong> was out of place since it was rare to get someone to come by and relay her anti-mush research. Our <strong>Ian</strong> who thought so highly of his babies(plants) came on during the middle of the day *Cycle 4* to treat any of the plants... (What I consider odd behavior since plants can be afflicted by statuses in between cycle changes from my limited knowledge). <strong>Kuan Ti</strong> had mentioned dismantling the shower prior to selection... but after that shrugged it off leaving Paola missing out on a sofa for quite a while until we could get the required plastic tube. This plastic tube was thankfully granted by our Physycist/Tech Raluca which left front storage a long time after selection... not the only time I was shocked by her.</p><p>Gieole served as guidance for the crew with technicalities and corrected our reasoning but no one took the initiative to take the role of leadership and I slowly ended up pushing tasks to people through the general chat. This ultimately gave a clearer picture to how people are addressing their tasks and would raise our suspicions... Chun was an exception as she really fit for one that has Lethargy with the amount of cycles she'd rather stay in bed. Kuan Ti was an underperformer according to the progress he had on any of the projects or his roles, his activity on the ship suggested otherwise and he acted so ever happy-go-lucky. This left him to his eventual fate of being shot at by our newly appointed Commander <strong>Chao</strong>(presumably his first playthrough too!) and bludgeoned by a Gieole that was hiding behind the disguise of a bronze.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_garden.png" alt=":mush_pa_garden:" class="tid_ico"><strong>Ian</strong> was our spiritual healer as he spouted spiritual words and blessings while taking care of his precious little things. Seemingly unwavered by the small victory humanity had over his mush buddy, he continued to spread good vibes and dutifully did his job of taking care of the flowers albeit at cycle 4 and relayed researches sparingly with his level 3 Ian skills combo. His daily contribution was comparable to and above some humans on the ship. However, Day 6 Cycle 1 was what it took him to really slip up though! It was after <strong>Gieole</strong> had luckily found an <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> planet and we were coordinating with commander <strong>Chao</strong> for a jump. Ian had loaded the fuel... snuck by IB, when offered to join the upcoming expedition and then went back to go through both dorms ending up in Alpha Dorm(no shower). Putting fuel was and important and dirty task and it was also a time he could proliferate his spores. I had also requested he assemble the <strong>Babel Module</strong> as he should have extra action points lying around... but he also managed to scrounge a cooked meal I had left aside in the AD. It was at the end of Day 5, cycle 8 when Paola had announced she couldn't decode the Rebel base signal which they broacasted starting cycle 8 for our ship. I asked our Shrink to top up :moral: before <strong>Paola</strong> eventually decoded it in the starting minutes of Day 6. Ian followed suit by asking for morale and stating the level of his <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_pmo:" class="tid_ico"> at.. <strong>5</strong> during cycle 1 of Day 6. To make that clear, the notification after Day 5's Rebel base is decoded informs us the crew gains <strong>3</strong> morale which to humans, is blatantly wrong as we get the actual number of 6. He had set himself up for death! <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As far as the crew was concerned, the mush were free after disposing of Ian on Day 6 - Cycle 2, but moving to the aforementioned planet was a different issue, and <strong>Ian</strong> had been the one to enter in the fuel<img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fuel.png" alt=":mush_fuel:" class="tid_ico">! Needless to say, somebody had to check it, and as I was one the people available when Commander Chao resumed his duties I went to face-check it. The gauge read the correct number of fuel and we were bound for a nice O2<img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/o2.png" alt=":mush_o2:" class="tid_ico"> planet! I went on to put my own set of guidelines of what should we bring down planetside, getting my checklist and waiting for people to bring down those items to IB. People started filtering down there to IB as I was removing outside threats and trying to hastily make my way there too to get the expedition started and end some time before cycle change out of Day 6 - Cycle 3. Expedition items accounted for and crew willing to hold them, made a mess out of the IB logs with pick ups and drops. The only thing I needed to bring was the Blaster... which was recently used for an execution...</p><p>The <strong>blaster</strong> turned out to be in the <strong>Rear Corridor</strong>, where Finola dropped it to move it closer to Icarus Bay. As I made my way fresh from the seat of a patroller through Bravo Bay and the corridor, I see a blip, Finola's message appears on the shared chat with all the remaining humans. It goes along like "We should thank Roland for taking the initiative..." I read it while scrambling for that last piece needed for a good expedition, then a message appears... <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico">Roland has joined the mush! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> It was then where I hastily clicked to skill up <strong>anonymush</strong> during the time it took Finola to finish her reasoning for the commendation. I browsed for mush skill choices and turned to <strong>Traitor</strong> (to see what can happen in a small 4-zone planet) hoping to launch with three when <strong>Raluca</strong> chimed in... for another surprise as she would be completing the number of people we can send on an expedition.</p><p>On the last few days, it was easier to blend in with the crew as I only needed to do my duties and can't say I'm skimping out on food when there is none left-- Ian's poor saplings died off on Day 8 cycle change. It almost seemed to be a successful Sol infiltration for the mush team but was limited by Raluca's schedule and the ship ended up being destroyed by a wave of hunters before Pilgred was completed. Overall, a nice game with active Finola, Paola, Gieole, Stephen, Chao- had stayed for quite a while and I'm impressed, with Ian and Kuan Ti fitting into the actives as well. Chun and Raluca were there at least once a day, while Chun could have done better with communication.</p>

I wasn't quite sure which second skill to take, what with Frieda also being a zombie however Kuan Ti was a gold with astro. So, I just stayed solid until I renewed my gold days. When I actually awoke, there was no need for cameras to be installed and the ship was quite slow filling.</p><p>The ship was not in great shape with all those zombies, including all but one pilot. But until he awoke, we manned the turrets. By the time everyone awoke, the hull was around 60%.</p><p>My solid skill came in useful as I managed to move two people from the lab to front storage (one went straight there, and the other took a detour via the garden, but surprised it was that easy). One got traded for a hydropot, but the other wasn't traded away in time and starved.</p><p>Activity was low and so was antimush research. Projects progressed slowly too but there laid my first suspect - Kuan Ti. Relayed projects with his <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"> neron <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"> points but still took a bed. With no astro happening (by then, I had renewed gold and installed a camera in the Nexus, letting the other tumble onto the lab shelving), I suggested that Kuan Ti should find a planet. Next cycle he said. Suspicious, eh? what happened to his ap from being in bed for many cycles? In a private chat with Finola, Chun, and then also Chao, I had mentioned Kuan Ti was in BD with Ian. Chao had <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico">shooter <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"> points. As Kuan Ti had moved to the bridge, Chao attacked him there. I finished mush Kuan Ti off.</p><p>With the zombies starving, that meant the other alpha mush was active. I already had suspicions about Ian but this was confirmed when he slipped up about morale. With Roland's help, the alpha mush were dead.</p><p>I did think that both the alpha mush had been trapping shelves left, right and centre. I had hoped that we were still mush free.</p><p>Roland was very busy with piloting duties and the turrets continued to be well used, although towards the end, he seemed reluctant to shoot many hunters and it stirred a thought that we had a beta.</p><p>Raluca was a once-a-day player, and we could have coped with that, if the hull was repaired, and the o2 tanks both hadn't been broken for a couple of cycles on the last day. Her last ap dump took Pilgred to 87% - however, the remaining crew were not around to help finish it.</p><p>The banana trees had all died.</p>

                <p>I think a bunch of your traps were eaten by <strong>Chun</strong>, had 1 spore on a few people... Stephen, Chao, Raluca for the few I know of... and I was wary of spores in the bays, I tried switching it up a bit and go for the patroller in AB2... xD! I don't think anyone touched the cat at all... It would've looked really weird if you couldn't assemble the Babel module! You were just waiting for us to move around and get spored first &gt;:3. You trappers did some nice work... I knew RC was going to be bad.... but Finola dropped the Blaster there!!! No idea where I got my first spore though.</p>
