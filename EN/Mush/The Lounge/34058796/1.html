                <p><strong>Terrence</strong> here <img src="http://twinoid.com/img/icons/mush/terrence_archer.png" alt=":tid_mush_tease_TA:" class="tid_ico">,</p><p>yeaterday, at day 14, cycle 6, we did it - we returned to Sol and that is our great story. I have never been on such an intense ship. It was also one of the MMM's ship.<br>(Ending: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1236)" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1236)</a></p><p><strong>a promising beginning</strong>: I think our start was really good, we saw that we have lots of active players mostly joining the ship because of the MMM. Chao was a newbie, but active and he helped us out when we were giving him advices. The only strange person right from the start was Ian. I think i haven't read a single word from him in the whole game. Our Gioele was standing out a bit - it seemed like he had incredible much experiences, also Frieda was experienced and really active and doing lots of planet scannings, so our hopes for this ship were high :-)</p><p><strong>The first exploration and the dead of Hua/KuanTi</strong><br>At our first oxygen planet we had incredible bad luck... no oxygen (pump failure), predators were attacking us, accidents and we lost Hua in the forest.. there was no single sector with a positive event. But the worst was that Hua was found dead at the end of the expedition. That was really unfortune, because Hua was very active and as pilot and botanist (with that bad Ian we had) really worthful. We could not believe that this was only bad luck, we thought it had to be a mush with traitor skill amongst the expedition members. some of them were ill, 3 others were tested with the spore sucker test. Some time after Kuan Ti used the spore sucker Chun was using her premonition skill, got the message that he has"extracted a spore" , misunderstood that and killed him (probably i would have misunderstood it too and it was her only big mistake, she was a really good help, i am glad that we had her :-) ).</p><p>(We had also bad luck with oxygen with the next planet but at least at the third and fourth planet with oxygen we could fill our tank.)</p><p><strong>The search for the final mush</strong><br>because of Eleesha's list we managed to kill our first mush, Raluca, at day 4 ( i think). day after day passed and there was no suspicious behaviour, we could not find the last mush.. some got ill in that time ( sometimes manipulated: stephen delivered me and janice bananas which were spoiled, i realized that after eating one <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> ) and Gioele asked whether someone wanted to make a voluntary spore sucker test. <br>After that was done, i realized that Gioele was acting strange. He gave not so much advices, was not that active anymore and did mistakes, like unsuccessful trying to repair an oxygen tank although i said that i was about to go there (as technician ;-)). But it was weekend, so i thought that he has maybe less time at weekends... one time we had a fire and Gioele was just running to extinguish it, saying he didn't find one extinguisher. That was the situation which was most suspicious to me, i had the feeling that the extinguisher was there not a long time ago (but i was not sure)-when searching, i really found 2 hidden extinguishers... I opened a new conversation with only trusted persons and discussed mostly with Frieda whether Gioele is a betamush, we even thought about the possibility that Finola has infected him while he did the spore sucker test... unfortunately we dismissed that theory and went for the idea that Roland is our only and last mush, becaue every other crewmember was ill or did a test during our voyage so far...and we were able to researched the retro fungal serum.</p><p><strong>Gioele showing his true face</strong><br>when we got that serum, lots of people were gathering at the bravo dorm (also the drones <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) and Roland was lying peaceful in the bed. Then there was a long discussion whether we should try that serum on Roland or not. Gioele was really against it and gave the advice to try testing Roland first with a spoiled banana. <span class="tid_wspoil">This is also a mystery for me until now: did you want to get cured or did you want to kill some valuable persons when the room was guarded or did you just wanted to slow us down?</span> But we had a bad feeling and i think it was already day 10 with lots of bad events so we decided to just try the serum out on Roland. <br>Just when paola was inocculate the serum, Gioele attacked me. i was quick enough to escape the room (just before cycle change-could it be that you thought you have killed me at that moment Gioele, or did you just don't want to follow me?). so Gioele was obvous mush and we killed him. His final words were, that we are doomed and that he was it all along...</p><p>so it seems to me, that our first theory was right, Finola has infected Gioele, when he did the spore sucker tets with her <span class="tid_wspoil">Finola, how did you do it? he had 0 spores a day before i think. my only theory is that he had to use the shelve in the medlab often before the test and you restocked it with traps..</span></p><p>But we were not sure, so we wanted to wait, whether Finola was acting susoicious... and she was showering at least, but we waited again. unfortunately not very much time later Paola was standing in her room. and after that she died of depression :/ Now we were sure, it had to be Finola, and we immediately killed her.</p><p><strong>The last days</strong><br>we thought we were finally mush - free and that was right like i see now. we had lots of problems with fire (we had no fire detector :/). we did a great job, could also plant jumpkin trees, visited even crystalite zones for 2 times (unfortunatley no star map) and managed to survive until day 14, cycle 6. at cycle 5 of day 14 i wasn't able to hack the terminal to flee from the asteroids so we had only 5 hull left at cycle 6. now i was successful and we returned finally to sol.</p><br><p>I am really proud of our crew, that ship was really intense and it made lots of fun :-) i will write probably more later. That's all for now.</p>

                <p>Hey there, Finola your loyal mush here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It was a pretty good ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> ... You can imagine how it felt like when we (with Raluca) realized what a "powerfull" mush combination we are - both unable to move and both under camera.</p><p>During first days (the mushi situation in medlab) i spored Stephen <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> and decided he should be the first beta mush (nice skills set and access to rations).</p><p>I tried my best to slow down the research (and not to shed too much suspicion on me) however you made it really fast to do the *antispore gas* and *contipaspore serum* which made it quite obvious that classic infection will not work anymore (due to our inability to move freely without being suspected)...</p><p>Then you got Raluca also quite early in the voyage, so i had to be very cautious <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>I took demoralize and trapper and trapped the door to Refectory. Well at that time i thought that individual objects can be trapped - what a mistake <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ... This spore was picked up by Gioele like 2 days later during a fire. At that time the mycoscanner was finished and everybody checked and sucked the spores.</p><p>So I decided to turn Gioele - the most active anti-mush person on the ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>I trapped Central and Front Corridor and asked him to check whether the extinguisgers are still there.<br>Unfortunately he picked up only the spore from Central Corridor while going to medlab to test me with spore sucket test (which i agreed to do). I hoped Gioele will be already turned to mush when he comes to medlab, so I had to improvize fast - I took the spacesuit and went to drop it to bravo bay.<br>While going there i extracted 2 spores and when i came back, i took the mycoalarm, infected Gioele - turning him to mush and dropped the mycoalarm.</p><p>Then our first mistake happened - I thought Gioele is AFK, so i took anonymush, but at that time Gioele took anonymush too <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>When the majority decided to try the serum on Roland I tried my best to finish it ASAP <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> so you waste it on Roland (well i hoped you'll rage-kill him).<br>The hidden extinguishers incident made our mush life harder and in the end it forced Gioele to attack Terrence - he indeed thought you're dead.</p><p>I was then quietly waiting in the corner and did not bother to trap more shelves, because 4 spores were needed to convert a human.<br>When Paola wrote that she is low on morale and even a single panic attack could make her big problems, I decided to demoralize-kill her. I thought that you will be more cautious after rage killing Kuan-Ti and that was my fatal mistake <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I had lot of APs and MPs but had to go AFK for an hour after doing the demoralize and when i came back i was dead already ...</p><p>PS: the first days when you were talking about a mush on expedition and when Chun killed Kuan-Ti were really amusing for us alpha mushes <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> ... First expo finished and 2 humans dead without our intervention <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Frieda here.</p><p>Definitelly one of the most enjoyable ships, even though we never managed to get an eden map piece and we started to get overwhelmed at the end. It was sad to see Kuan die to an ambiguos message and Hua to incredibly bad luck ("Your crewmates can't be bothered coming to get you" is a lie, we did find you...dead; here are the expedition results - <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/1246" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/1246</a> ).</p><p>After Kuan's death we became overly cautious and didn't act solely on mush suspicions; we tried to slowly test everyone and always tried to find flaws in every theory. This is what led to Paola's death - after it was certain that only Finola could be our hidden alpha mush, someone (that might or might not have been me) doubted if the spore sucker test even worked and this gave Finola the opportunity to demoralize Paola to death while we discussed it...</p><p>This leads me to the absolutely stellar mush play by our Finola, probably the second worst character to be mush as. I'd really like to know how you managed to turn Gioele in a day, he was spore free when we finished our mycoscanner.</p><p>Everyone (well, except Ian who never spoke and barely did anything) was really great to play with. Gioele was really active and emerged as the natural leader of the ship; shame that we didn't recognized the signs, we could've cured him. Stephen and Terrence were really helpful and always there when something had to be done. Janice entertained us with her Neron voice. Chun and Eleesha really helped to keep the ship going in the last days when everything was falling apart around us and Roland did an awesome job keeping the skies clear (or clear enough for us to escape). Jin was also doing excellent job, his activity fell off a but in the later days, but I believe that was due to time zone differences and work. As for me, I vastly underestimated how little else I could do if I wanted to get us good planets to explore. And even when fully dedicated to it, one can always be screwed by bad luck...</p><p>All in all, it was a great experience. Thank you all!</p>

                <p>Gioele here. I wanted to stall you from using the cure because it would bring you closer to me and Finola, after you used it I decided to just go berserk and kill Terrence to sabotage PILGRED repairs... which I thought I had done, I only started attacking Chao because I thought Terrence was already dead, but apparently I got confused in the middle of it all and the damn engineer escaped. I also realized afterwards that I really should have used transfer on someone else but in the heat of the moment I'd forgotten all about it.</p><p>As for getting mushed in the first place, I just let my guard down, I never imagined Finola would be able to spore me three times in such quick succession, but she baited me into a nice trap. She also revealed she was going to transfer into me if she failed -- I doubt she would have been able to pull that off, but anyway I guess she was out of options. She certainly did a good job masking her activities.</p>

                <p>It was just such a tense moment and I was so busy trying to think of arguments to stall you with that I didn't have much time to plan my actions, and of course once I committed to the attack it all happened very fast. I'm really annoyed I didn't notice you slip out, killing you would definitely have screwed the ship over permanently with no hope of winning, there was still so much work left on PILGRED. Finola should have just gone all-out and finished you off even after I made that mistake. It might have been smarter for me to just ride out the suspicion until she came back online and we could attack at the same time, and transferring would also have allowed me to do more damage later... but I guess I just wasn't cut out to be a mush.</p>

                <p>Hi, Stephen here :-)</p><p>Well, Gioele, with two Mush dead letting us finish the PILGRED repairs could have been a good strategy for an "infected return to Sol" (if we weren't already suspecting Finola, but it seems she didn't know that at the time).</p><p>As I said in the last days, I was very sorry for Kuan-Ti death in the beginning of the game: Terrence has failed to mention that also Kuan-Ti was a new player (not only Chao), but he was one of those rare new players that research a lot on the wiki and the forums!<br>We nearly suspected him of being a Mush because he knew so much about the game while he was claiming to be a new player :-)</p><p>I'm glad Finola stopped by and explained how did she managed to put all those spores on Gioele in such a brief time. I'm also honoured of being considered as the best choice for the first beta-mush, but I suspect you weren't ready for my paranoia about getting spored. After the mycoscan was created, I probably was the person who used it more! And before that, I was nearly avoiding to open up shelves in case someone trapped them.</p><p>I loved this ship and it has all been so intense that I haven't joined a new game yet.</p>

That's the furthest I had ever made it, and man does it get crazy. I can't even imagine trying to keep the Daedalus flying on Day 20.</p><p>I do wish I had been less timid about my investigations. I definitely saw Finola pick up the mycoalarm without explanation but figured it was just an honest mistake. (never assume that in Mush!) I also was well aware that there was no message of Gioele dropping the extinguisher in the rear corridor since he had hidden it, but I took him at his word that he put it there and assumed I had made a mistake. Hindsight is 20/20, but regardless I had a lot of fun and hope to have you all on future ships.</p>

                <p>What happened when you died: After your dead we were a bit demotivated and sad (NERON said, it would have love you, if it had a heart) and i wanted return to sol. Some asteroids were viewable which wanted to impact us at cycle 6. When Chao didn't show up at cycle 5 I took a coffe, a pumpkin and tried for 3 times to hack but failed. so the asteroids hit us and we lost 40 of our 45 def. With 5 hulls left we could return to sol at the next cycle.</p>

                <p>Raluca here! Your other alpha mush!<br>Maaan i was so looking forward to this MMM....and then after some minutes that shitty "feeling different" window appeared <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/mad.png" alt=":tid_mad:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":tid_nooo:" class="tid_ico"> I was soooo happy....NOT! I wanted to play as a team in a active crew! Damnit! Well...let´s make the best out of it and see what we can do as a mush team...at least with 2 people it might also be fun....<br>ok so finola is my partner..so she is in the front of the ship..and i am raluca..so i am in the back of the ship...shit! how are we supposed to work together? ah and she is a first time mush....GREAT! This gets better and better *rolling eyes*...now i have to spend hours and hours explaining her what to do and how to do and how not to get suspected etc...sigh..well...let´s first make sure both of us play and act as if we are humans (keeping/maintaining a low profile)....watch the crew and watch out for a) mistakes and b) who is active and a good target<br>and wow did the humans do it perfectly like a machine! our only hope was ian messing up something or chun as a newbie doing a mistake...or waiting for the expeditions/stronger hunter attacks/Ship falling apart to give us an opening! in the first 3 days we only managed to spore Stephen once....no other opening was there...well....we created around 3 openings...but every time suddently something unexpected happend...and it was always....IAN! Ian was always there in the exact right minute to prevent us from sporing...3 times! like he could read our mind! good thing was the first expedition...wow did we mush have fun during that expedition in the chat...and what happened after it! *giggle like crazy* you should have been there when we where reading the chat unable to do anything yet as a mush and you killing and suspecting each other.<br>well...but on the other hand you also did the (hopefully soon to be banned) spore sucker test...and there i had to raise my voice and make me a little suspicious by being the only one against it! did not like it that you in the end could kill me by doing the spore sucker test (in combination with the tabulatrix)...and i reported the ship for using it. but now that the ship has ended and the SDF did not finish their discussion if the spore sucker test will be considered an exploit you do not have to fear a punishment anymore!<br>i am proud of my finola that she managed to turn someone into mush...well...and i really found it funny that your argumentation for killing me was that i as raluca was "too eager to advance pilgred and did not invest enough AP"... i 100% played as a human so that was funny...really strange argumentation....we could have had so much more fun if the humans would have played fair on this ship (without spore sucker test)..looking forward to the next MMM and i hope i can finaly play as a human on a active ship!</p><p>btw hi Ravien! Long time no see!</p>

                <p>"Mentioned casually"??<br>After the expedition I was like screaming "Hey, I'm human, I've got a disease!"</p><p>I clearly play this game in a way that makes me look really dumb. I hope I'm not.</p><p>BTW, I don't like the spore sucker test, and I said that more than once in some private channels. I would have done it if requested to (I was human and wanted to stay in the ship), but it's completely unfair. At least with rotten food test someone who doesn't get sick could just belong to the 10% of chance of not doing so. And you have to prepare the food, there is a limited amount of it, etc.<br>Sporesucker test gives an extra use to something that is already really useful. They should fix this letting mush hurt themselves with the sporesucker.</p>
