                <p>Ship link: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3973" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3973</a></p><p>Ok, I had a blast on this ship... even if you guys did make it absolute hell to get anything accomplished.</p><p>An Eleesha that actually does a round to check logs once a day... an active Chun... a pushy Raluca that had the right idea from the start. Thankfully, I'm also pushy. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I was VERY careful to always have a good excuse to be dirty or move around the ship. Those fires I went after so quickly? None of them made me dirty... but damned if it wasn't a great excuse to be dirty so I could pull a spore!</p><p>When I "got sick" on the first expedition, my gastro miraculously went away on the first cycle change. It was almost hard for me to stand around until cycle change after the expo so I could avoid triggering the vomiting when moving between rooms... I usually hate being in Icarus for more than a few minutes after returning. Though it was a great chance to infect KT after Ian left the room.</p><p>And holy crap that expo! The only zones my traitor skill *didn't* fire on were Oxygen and Fuel... which were the entire reason I took the skill!</p><p>Fast forward a few days of not being able to do much of anything and another fire so another chance to pull a spore. KT was alone in Nexus and it was a great chance to give him another spore. I knew the Mycos had been placed, but I didn't see Chun go through rear corridor and didn't scroll down far enough to see Ian hide the Myco <em>with KT in the room so it was in the public logs</em>. Epic fail on my part. Especially after being so careful for so long. I think I had everyone fooled (except Raluca)... not sure if I really did or not, but even as I type this while sitting in Pasiphae, I think I did.</p><p>So knowing that I did that, I became completely neurotic. I was waiting for Eleesha to leave the dorm to know when I needed to start watching carefully. She popped into the dorm then immediately back out after printing the list and I knew I was humped.</p><p>I started refreshing the screen like crazy and saw a dot on the tracker move from Icarus Bay over to Alpha Bay and knew it was probably Chun and Eleesha trying to get their timing right to come attack me. You *almost* succeeded... if I hadn't been watching like a hawk, you would have. With 4hp left, I bolted for Pasiphae and took Phagocyte so I could recover some health. The extra AP from that and a saved mission from Jin Su helped a lot, especially because I've got a wound that makes everything cost 1ap more than usual. So with 11ap, I landed, went and wailed on Raluca a little bit because why not... she was the only one that figured it out from the start... and hopped back in Pasiphae.</p><p>Knowing that I'm screwed and my partner is one of two on THE List, I decided to start the mindgames and claim that I had been turned. Chun saw it for the ploy it was... at first. Then Eleesha remembered the expedition where I "got sick" and went right back to believing me.</p><p>Went to bed for the night, fairly certain that you’d abandon me in the night… and you did. But reading through the chat, I can’t help but laugh. I slimetrapped Jin Su and reported him dirty. Hua later reported him dirty after I was already out in Pasiphae, then later killed him. Looks like Eleesha killed Hua for killing Jin Su. There’s no way I’m confirming my death on this ship til I see how things play out. This part is WAY more fun than the passing time and praying I get an excuse to be dirty so I can pull spores.</p><p>I really do hope I get to play with most of you again.. this time on the same team. Most of you were great fun... especially when things got a little crazy.</p><p>Oh, one more note. Other than making sure I didn't give Eleesha and Chun confession lists that proved I had 16 morale at all times, I never altered any of the lists. All of those confessions were 100% true, just missing some actions from what I really saw. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>(Forgive the tense irregularities... I was writing this while I was in Pasiphae/watching the carnage unfold after my death <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> )</p>

                <p>Hi there. Mushy Frieda here, nice to see a write up by you Andie.</p><p>To answer your question, Sperbi, Janice seemed to be a griefer, she grabbed the grenades, turned both the AI inhibator and pilot look off, then stayed in a patrol ship, refusing to come back until we flew off and left her behind. She also had NERON's best friend as her only skill, she claimed that she misclicked in the beginning but judging but her later actions this might not be true.</p><p>I was incredibly paranoid about Eleesha's tracking ability. If anyone seemed to be doing anything even slightly odd she was there questioning it. I was so worried about her and whether she was on to us. I spent most of the time trying to come up with planets that had some risk factor to them and lying about safe planets but sadly Gioele was also an astrophysicist and came up with good planets instead.</p><p>Once I was on a list with only Paola, who had spent all her time on the Bridge doing comms work, I knew my time was up. Eleesha sent a private message to me saying that she thought Paola was the mush and for me to not call attention to it, but I'm pretty sure she was lying and trying to catch me off guard. After Andie was left behind and we were in orbit on a planet I quickly killed Raluca and hopped in the Icarus, hoping to die on a solo expedition and leaving the crew unable to do expeditions. Sadly that didn't work out and on coming back I was killed straight away.</p><p>It was good playing with you all, especially you Andie.</p>
