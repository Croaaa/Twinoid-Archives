                <p>Hey peeps!</p><p>Even though this was a scrape back to Sol A.S.A.P. run, there were a few moments and a few crew members which I wanted to remember. So, here we go!</p><p>I was <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/hua.png" alt=":mush_hua_50:" class="tid_ico"> on this ship, my favorite character. Everything Wasn't exactly normal around selection, One of the things being that Stephen cooked around half of the rations before selection, not knowing that Neron would destroy all of them. He was obviously quite new to the game, since he only had chef and thought that utilising his skill would help out the crew. I won't hold this against you, hoping that you learn from this.</p><p>After a little while, we wanted to move away from the initial planet we were orbiting. Unfortunatly, our commander was inactive. By the time we got our act together: <em>we were on 6 O2</em>. We were orbiting a planet which had 12 zones: one had <strong>O2</strong>, another had a <strong>Volcano</strong>. It was clear, given the activity of the crew, that we would not be able to jump, scan for a planet, hit O2, jump to that planet and run an expo for it. It then lead to my first expedition on the ship.</p><p>I decided to take my trackie, a blaster and a ration. The ration was in case I had to run the expo again. Oh, and I should say I did this in a patroller, to minimise the total potential damage to the ship. So I launched the expo from space. <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/expPerma/15924"><em>And it was a success</em></a>. I managed to get 24 O2 in the first zone, and got through two other zones without taking a point of damage. I saved the crew.</p><p>After this, the crew started to get it's act together and jumped away. We then stopped for a while to scan. However, the main planet scanner, Frieda, was not doing her work. She was a pilot, yes, but her astro duties should take hold at this point in time. Eventually, a few of the crew mates decided (Myself, Gioele and Paola) to execute her. I then moved to kill her.</p><p>A quick side note, it was probably the funniest fight I've had. First of all, my initial 5 or so punches were <em>pure</em> right hooks. Then, after a while, she actually woke up and <em>started scanning</em>. Yep. I kid you not, <em>she started scanning whilst I was punching her to death</em>. She even posted the planet on the thread before she died.</p><p>Nonetheless, we had found and killed our first mush. After a bit more time scanning, and killing hunters, we found a nice planet which had a few good supplies like fruit, fuel, O2 and most importantly the possibility of rations to replace our nearly-depleted stock. The expeditions went ahead without any major hiccups.</p><p>However, the hull was becoming weak, and it was becoming clear that we would not last much longer, given our very small amount of active crew. Pilgred was at 0%, but there was a trader which was offering pilgred. It was our lifeline. However, there was still 1 mush on board. We took the risk of buying pilgred <em>before</em> killing the last mush. The main reason for this was that KT, an inactive, was (about) to starve, and so we had to sell him quickly.</p><p>This then lead to a final, intense mush hunt. We had a couple of people we were suspicious of: Raluca, for somewhat randomly killing Derek and not fixing pilgred at all, and using "all" of her AP on the turrets. Roland, for not helping with piloting at all, and holding two precious rations.</p><p>We decided to go for Raluca first. She was human. Getting panicked, we started to prepare to kill Roland, whilst keeping the bridge secure. It <em>was</em> possible that Gioele was mush, and was hoping for the trade to happen. If Roland were not mush, he would of been the next too fall.</p><p>This is where, I, the wonder woman stepped in once again. After only 5 slices at him, Roland fell, revealing that he was mush and that we were now mush-free. It was finally time to go home.</p><p>I must say, this was quite an intense ship! I really had to manage my AP carefully, since as the botanist, I also had to maintain the garden, along with being the main fighter pilot and expedition leader. Personally, I felt this was the best I have played for a long while, being the wonder woman who also killed both mush.</p><p>Before I sign off, thanks too:</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/gioele_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_GR:" class="tid_ico"> for being with us, for being a great commander and giving out missions, and also he;ping with the mush hunt.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/paola_rinaldo.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_PR:" class="tid_ico"> for being attentive to the situation, keeping up with trades and getting comms work done.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/janice_kent.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_JK:" class="tid_ico"> for helping with moral, healing and also helping with the mush hunt.</p><p>And Andie, for being a great Expedition partner.</p><p>Thanks all!</p>
