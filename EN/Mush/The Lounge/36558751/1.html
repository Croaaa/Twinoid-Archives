                <p>I'll have more to say later, but the brief highlights - total chaos at the very end of the ship, I actually wondered if I may be reported for 'Hostile advancement to Eden', heh... we did not have agreement about much of anything at the end. Eden trip was launched without a pilot because our Chao decided <strong>He Was Going And He Would Kill If He Had To To Get On The Icarus</strong>, and he launched it before we were quite ready to go...</p><p>Terrence got the 3rd starmap piece on the first step of the expo, rushed to get washed, take from Icarus to nexus and solve; Chun already had, watched her pick up 2 starmaps, drop 2, couldn't find 3rd... then she dropped the third too; got it solved as she went to wash to help... ran ran ran for the bridge, work got busy, called away...</p><p>next step of the planet expo happened... it was another starmap (on a planet that could kill us)... got us to Eden at last, whew</p><p>And... have to add, this was a random ship. Many less active players, but everyone did their best! ... even Gioele, who also put at least 7 AP into the cube, and Chao who... went totally off the deep end at the end, breaking netiquette and threatening to kill if he 'had to'. Were some communication issues throughout... but it happened again.</p><p>A random ship, on to Eden, through all the difficulties of working together and the challenges of the Random Number God.</p><p>This is two randoms to Eden in a row for me now. I am so amazed and pleased.</p><p>edit to add: Oh yeah, I am JinSu, forgot to say.</p><br><p>Oh yes, and this is 'Turrets to Eden' because we actually used our Turrets a LOT. And the coordination this ship showed when it mattered, especially early and mid game was <em>unbelievable</em>! More when I have time.</p>

                <p>Chun here! Wow, guys, I really didn't think we'd do so well. My experiences with pubbie ships have always been pretty terrible. This was my first time playing Chun, and it was really easy to get uber paranoid and suspect everyone, since I had noone to turn to as a guaranteed human for the first few days.</p><p>Thankfully my newbishness as Chun didn't cause us too much grief, other than suggesting we use the cure on Hua (We had a lot of suspicions, it just turns out they were all terrible ones!) At any rate day one I really started forming a list of people I knew, or strongly believed, weren't mush. I kinda worked backwards doing a sort of process of elimination. Our mush were hella sneaky. Mad props to you mush. They survived for a pretty long time by Mush standards. Finally though we weeded them out and dispatched them.</p><p>The commander (Who I'd say is definitely our MVP of this ship, really taking charge and keeping everyone in line) caught Ian red handed (Red thumbed?) by rigorous mycoscanner testing. By some insane relay work (And honestly, relay work was fantastic on this ship, everyone coordinated really well and we worked together great) We finished Natamy Rifle like, that cycle, and kicked Ian's hippie butt.</p><p>I had a lot of suspicions about Finola too, though. Her speech patterns mimicked the speech we intercepted from the Pheromodem, and she always spent a ton of time around Ian, who we also suspected (and later confirmed) as being mush. She also acted a tad mushy. I had some other suspicions bit it seems like so long ago I've already forgotten them! Eventually I kind of forced her into an unwinnable situation where she had no way out other than to play dumb. I talked Finola into blitzing some research via relays with me, and she was down with the idea. I "noticed" we had a pile of something like 14 bananas sitting in the lab so I suggested we chow down so we can get even more research done. She played dumb and ran away. That was when my suspicions were confirmed of course, and had Jin Su blow her head off with the Natamy rifle. My heart did a little flutter before screen changes, waiting for it to update, and YES!!! She was mush.</p><p>It's a good thing I did that sneaky little move too, since, according to the end game comments, She was gunna kill me the next day! Really glad I didn't just "Wait it out" like <strong><em>SOMEONE</em></strong> was suggesting.</p><p>Being mush free was pretty great. I quickly finished all the research with more help from the crew. Then, after reading the medic book, I took off to the dorms and starting playing Nurse Chun. Healing people all over the place and trying to keep people's health up and updating the health thread like mad.</p><p>Then things started to get scary. Every day people were reaching 5hp, or 4hp, after I had just healed them up to full. Our shields were getting blown to bits by hunters and asteroids, and we knew we had to do ONE more expedition and then go SOMEWHERE be it eden or sol, or we'd all die. Then BAM! TWO MORE STAR MAPS bringing us up to 4. Good going Terry <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> I brought them to the nexus and then hopped in the shower so I could clean myself off to research the star map. I didn't even get out of the shower and we were already at Eden! Crazy overactive Jin Su, researching the map so quickly <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Thank you all for an AMAZING ship and I hope to play with you guys in the future!</p>

                <p>Finola here. I don't always find a good human crew, but when I do, I'm the mush.</p><p>There wasn't much stuff left to do than playing the most "unsuspect" possible and doing the mass sabotage when the water hit humans' butt. Bad luck with random injuries too. Game engine spoiled me(can eat only once/cycle and don't get any APs).</p><p>My plan was to kill Chun(who was holding the Hacker Kit), change body with Jin Su(who had a spore from Ian), get 2 O2 capsules and fly away with the pasiphae.</p><p>Parallel to this, I was also playing mush in French version as Ian[<a href="http://mush.vg/theEnd/40698" target="_blank">http://mush.vg/theEnd/40698</a>], using the same strategy(well, kinda). Small change in the end, as Jin Su was on expedition. Instead, I mushised Chao, abandoned expeditioners by hacking the command terminal and then changed body with highest triumph player(Terrence). End result did compensate the failure of this one.</p>

                <p>You guys will never guess who I was. Loved you all. Even Terrence, that fagg*t. Come say hello now that the show is over, man! Hey, commander, I made you mad at least a couple times, right? I could feel that. And I thought "I hope it doesn't spoil his game. He's a cool guy." But a Chao is a Chao and when I step onstage is to play the role. Also, look at my profile. I wasn't bluffing. I really don't care about glory and would really kill Terrence if that lucky bastard wasn't so lucky. Beware, you will never know when you are in the same ship as me! Keep an eye on the blasters.</p>

                <p>Glad you stepped up to talk to us in [AP], Chao-Jesus!<br><br>Glad you were aboard, too. The only things I'd ask of you would be 'remember the rules make it a game, break the rules (even netiquette) and you worsen the game... it's possibly to play really yourself and in a way that others can be comfortable with too', and 'Remember you can roleplay out actions that would harm the ship, without harming the ship at all... acting on them, that's a different thing'.<br><br><br>That said, you walked the line of 'harm' beautifully. I considered reporting you for netiquette, in the end did not, but I won't repeat your words that crossed the netiquette line here.... I can't or I'd break forum language rules!<br><br>As to dropping down to the planet when and how you did; edge of harm, on the side of 'alright, barely'. Could have ended with the deaths of the whole expo team, made more likely by the odds of crashing without a pilot on landing.... but as it worked out - it was perfect.<br><br>I doubted we could keep you alive; I feared your real life stuff that you told us about would steal you away from us so much you'd die before you got back! However, you managed to stay with us, and you were helpful and useful as much as you could be. Thank you for that. You were also more entertaining than you were bad, more helpful than you were harmful, and if a certain Terrence was sending me PMs telling me how much he wanted to kill you in the end... well. I'm sure if finding the third starmap piece right at the first zone of the expo, after a safe landing despite being pilot-less during the expo you rushed didn't make him forget that feeling.... surely finding the 4th starmap piece on the second zone of that deathtrap of a planet when it was probably our last expo possible no matter what happened down there... surely that made him forget all bad feeling!<br><br>As for me... yeah. I'm glad you were with us. And while I seriously considered reporting you for netiquette... I actually didn't. But I would have, if you'd tried to actually kill Roland. And that report wouldn't have been about Netiquette, heh.<br><br>Adding up all the plus and minus though - I'm glad you were on the ship, and you were part of our success. Thanks, Jesus!</p>

                <p>Oh man, I'm really happy to know that my antics didn't spoil the game for you! And didn't that psycho-take-off really made for a thrilling ending? I was on the edge of the chair.</p><p><em>"and if a certain Terrence was sending me PMs telling me how much he wanted to kill you in the end"</em><br>Oh ha ha haha, this gave me a good laugh! Yes, in the main chat he was in that mode I call "using-smilling-emoticons-to-try-to-play-cool-while-actually-inscribing-my-name-on-a-voodoo-doll-and-chewing-his-gums".</p><p>About the real life issues: things were calm in a few days and I finally was able to go back to the game. Yes, I did my best to log at least once a day during an emergency situation! The first days I was hit by that I really couldn't think or care about the game (much already going in my mind), but I kept logging because I didn't want to spoil the game for you guys. Specially for you, man. You were an amazing Commander from day one! Wasn't the case I probably wouldn't care. But now things are mostly ok, and I can fish very close to my house. Really, it's surreal. The birds and cats also fish on my street that is bubbling with small fish.</p><p>But back to the game...</p><p>No, I wouldn't kill Roland that time. Total bluff. But I would keep the lenses for myself for some time.<br>Oh, by the end I almost made you hostage, but again, your charisma won over my psychosis.<br>Yeah, it was a good ride.</p>

                <p>Hah, it's unlikely that will often happen. I understand your love of big guns though! But really, the only reason those turrets worked like they did was that we both had someone spend real life money to get the target assist project, and because we were amazingly lucky. Again and again and again.... amazing.</p>

You know how to get to Eden now (if you didn't before, some of you did!): you've seen it done, you've done it. You know what the ingredients are, and how to bake them, what degree of AP to spend and not spend yet to heat the oven and make Eden rise near the top of the possibilities.</p><p>You've seen a team made, from widely different personalities and online playtimes. You've seen priorities chosen between many conflicting needs. You heard strategy discussed, and many of you participated in the debates, about what was better for a short-lived ship and what was needed for a long lived ship that might make it to Eden.</p><p>Now you have a new ship, full of 15 other people, those actives with their minds full of questions, perhaps of hope, wondering how to reach out to the other actives on board and make this ship, their new and ill-fitting and ill-feeling ship great too.</p><p>Reach out to them. Make it happen. Make it be beautiful. Make your ship fit; almost everyone aboard is certain to like it if you do.</p>

First Eden except games in casting.<br>To answer Chao, over the end, I was split between the fact that you played roleplay or that you wanted to enjoy rotting the game crush at the moment or all the organization had just been made during the four hours of front for 15 next minutes, what you have make. Then, we were lucky for the landing and for the first sections. Phew.<br>If I use smileys, it is simply to put more conviction in my limited vocabulary and I spoke of killing you only after having understood that you had no interest of our organization.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">And for turrets, aim heuristics was my present (and moreover, we had projects, objects and artefact which made them more powerful than they can be on the begin).</span></p><p>Thanks to everybody!</p>

                <p>Right, agreed with Phocks. But - you can present yourself, in RP fashion, as a crazed, pushed to his limit, cannot take it any more character - without causing aware and paying-attention people interacting with you to feel distress (those not with it might misunderstand, no help for that - but the paying-attention folks, the people there really playing beside you, those are the ones to really play 'with', not 'against'<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">. The difference lies in being an actor portraying being a thug for a play or a movie, and being a thug who isn't portraying anything, but just being.</p><p>We're actors here. The prizes of 'great play, want to play with again!' go to the actors as a rule. I know the game was quite frustrating to your character; you didn't get to shoot anyone, both mush were slain when you were offline; you only participated in... was it 2 expos? (granted we only did what, 6? *checks* Oh, 8. Still, very few, and your playtime access was extremely limited)... and you had to deal with 'in character annoyances' of there being a gloryhound around.</p><p>But none of those mean, be the thug instead of portray the thug. You can convey the same message without profanity, and without a sense of extreme 'wow, it's not the character that snapped, it's the <em>player</em> that lost it!' feel.</p><p>I'd urge you to reach for the 'actor side' instead of the player side, in the feel you give to the other players... or keep your playerside interactions positive. It's 'good for the game' in so many ways.</p><p>But the past is past! Most of us are onto our next ships and next challenges, and we're all of us still learning, and that includes me. I learned stuff with you guys - most astonishingly that with the right supporting projects, equipment, and luck, turrets can indeed carry a ship very far along the path to success!</p><p>We actually had enough scrap that some of my fellow players were debating with me, as of like day 6, that we had enough scrap and shouldn't 'waste AP' to get any more. I still made us get a bit more scrap, but.... when the ship ended, I think we did have scrap left, and all ... 3 or 4?... drones were turbo firefighters, babel module and something else I think had been built, numerous hull repairs (without the oscilliscope that we couldn't make) had been done, and really, it went great.</p><p>The most impressive part of this ship to me was how poor Ian only made one spore, and used it D3 to trap the garden. We got the mycoscanner up a couple cycles later, and I scanned myself, 0 spores. I went on a roundabout, collecting expo equipment for Icarus bay (with my heart in my throat.... it was possible for me to have picked up 3 spores from perfectly placed roomtraps), rescanned, and 0 spores. Then I went to the garden to bring the mature plants back to the lab (we only wanted immature in the garden, for the growth boost) and checked for spores again.... and had one. I knew the roomlog, the previous person in the garden before me was Ian, and he had dropped the plants; if there'd aready been a spore in there, he would have gained it, so he had to have placed the spore.</p><p>But Ian was idle in the lab, and it was -Ian-, so we needed the Natamy rifle. And I alerted the part of the ship that were not extremely distrusted (though many in the group were not proven human yet) and together, we managed to research that rifle and use it enough shots to kill Ian within 1 cycle of starting the process to make the rifle (and I missed trying to hit him, even!).</p><p>Then, after that mush death and the huge amount of AP spent to make it happen between the rifle research and the movement (the kill itself was done with shooter points), the ship managed to get access to the mush channel only 2 cycles after Ian's death, and in the middle of that slow long research, Plasma shield appeared as a research choice (yes, even as we raced to make the rifle, there was also a lot of project being completed), Raluca was convinced to come and genius the cure and we had the cure in hand (my hand - but having trusted me with Natamy rifle use, and that Ian actually was a mush, as the only proof was my claim of having a spore and how I got it - my holding the cure was surely a small concern at that point... other that I was spored and a perfect transfer target then more than ever before) as the mush channel was accessed (very scary as both greatest mush suspects, Hua and Finola were both in the lab, helping progress mush channel access, and either could have tried to snatch the cure first... or after through transfer)...</p><p>That huge rush... massive AP expenditure.... and the ship still got comms work done (rebel base access and more xyloph done) and got plasma shield finished 8 cycles later.</p><p>Wow, wow, wow did this ship work as a team. Amazingly so. Incredibly so.</p><p>Kuan suicided a bit after that time, died of starvation, but he'd been active like 5 cycles before his death, active and helping and talking; he just never told us he was starving. No damage events happened in the last 8 cycles before his death, so he had to have known he was leaving us. I wish I knew why he chose that; I'd love to understand that choice. Kuan? Any answers?</p>
