                <p><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4647" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4647</a></p><p>I was Jin Su. It seemed to be a very active crew. I woke up was about to go kill some hunters since JS early days aren't that AP intensive, only to be told from Andie that she was staying in her ship until she got AP to land again. She didn't understand that it was best to rest up and start research quickly but ultimately that was a good thing because I was selected as Alpha Mush alongside Frieda and Andie never played again.</p><p>Frieda and I were good level Mush, and with my infector we immediately rushed and converted Raluca in her turret. No one noticed and we played as normal for a while. Ian picked up biologist so research was happening (although with fertile it wasn't much of an issue) and we had two plans. Frieda had trapped AB2 so Terrence became a conversion target after touching it. In the meantime I was working on converting inactive Eleesha in the front corridor. She and Roland were our two non-players and we wanted her to be suspiciously alive after Roland starved to eliminate one of the 2 visible Mush.</p><p>Then we hit some hiccups. Terrence wanted to come relay pilgred, and so Raluca trapped it and had a spore ready to hit and convert him during the relay. Only Terrence didn't come online when he said he would. Raluca said she got bored and trapped AB2 and then accidentally took her own spore off pilgred (Fear not, Raluca redeemed herself later).</p><p>Hua snagged the AB2 spore and then Frieda joined her planetside in on a crystalite planet. Everyone was spored. So it ended with Hua at 2, KT at 1, and Stephen at 1. Frieda took a risk and converted Hua in front of the mycoalarm. KT noticed it, but there was no way to know who on the expo was converted. I did my best to present the theory that someone with 2 spores going in must have been converted and extracted a spore immediately upon return. Thankfully no one thought about it too much to realize that spores can't be extracted in front of others and we bought ourselves some time.</p><p>Our main problem was Stephen. He had been pointed in the direction of Eleesha as an obvious Mush but then he went off and killed Derek. Then after Eleesha was killed by another crew member and the crew celebrated one less Mush, he killed Hua and Frieda because they were on the expo. 3 Mush down, 2 remaining, 1 visible.</p><p>Terrence was our next target and we got him rather easily (not 100% sure how this went down, Raluca will need to give the details). Raluca snagged him and grabbed Anon. So the crew thought one solo Mush remained amongst the 3 of us.</p><p>Terrence decided he would sacrifice himself to keep the rest hidden and stole a plan and taunted the crew. Then it occurred to Raluca that since she had Green Jellied ADorm's camera and Gioele, KT and Stephen were in there, Terrence should casually return to that room and transfer. We decided on KT because Stephen would immediately kill Terrence, the ship would see he was human and kill Stephen for his endless stream of lucky guess shootings mixed with a healthy dose of human slaughter.</p><p>Unfortunately the crew wasn't that logicial. Stephen declared that Terrence was just a griefer and others agreed with him without ever mentioning transfer. The next morning I woke to find that Stephen had been beating me (but thankfully ran out of AP) claiming I must be the final Mush. I tried to explain that Terrence was obviously a mush who had transferred into Gioele to make Stephen kill a human but he didn't understand the concept.</p><p>I rushed around the ship to find the medkit, healed myself up after stealing the ships medic book, and then went on the offensive against crazy Stephen in chat. Once it became clear that he had not logical theory for how it was me (beyond his uncanny luck) Paola stepped up to explain how transfer worked and to back me up. Then Terrence in his lovely new KT body killed Stephen. Somehow KT killing Stephen had Janice sure it was me.</p><p>As I said, logic was questionable on this ship.</p><p>However I was safely on the bridge with Paola, and Raluca and KT decided they might as well go for broke before we completed Pilgred and returned to sol. So at day change they converted Janice under a cam in the ADorm. We counted on no one coming back. They didn't. Gioele was hiding in the lab after being accused of being a transferred Terrence.</p><p>Then we hit our major hiccup. Raluca's computer crashed and she could only access Mush through her flashless phone. She could chat but not repair Pilgred. Since Ian had focused entirely on research and let the plants die post Hua's botany work, we had 5 o2 and a broken tank.</p><p>I went to bed as there was nothing I could do but hope I was alive in the morning. Sadly I logged in 1 minute to late and Raluca had just suffocated at the end of the previous cycle. KT had said he would rush the bridge and hack us home but must not have seen me say I'd arrived because shortly after I logged on we were back on Sol.</p><p>It was a great ride. Everyone who joined the mush team was great to work with and willing to play seriously. Now we've returned to Sol with a mush Jin Su, Kuan Ti, and Dr. Janice Kent.</p><p>I hope to play with many of you again!</p><p>PS: We knew Pheromodem was coming near the end and so Raluca posted: "Nice plan letting the plants die, Ian" one of the last comments I saw before KT hacked us back to Sol (feel a bit cheated out of that action) was Paola telling the ship that Ian was the final mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Raluca here, that was a great ship if you were a mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I've realized that I love green jelly. I slimed four cameras throughout that game and most of the active people had become mush so no one ever caught on to it. That's how I got Terrence, he was behaving erratically which threw off our plans (maybe it was intentional, too!) but he thought he was safe under that camera. Once we had him at 2 spores I slimed the camera and finished converting him. The humans were doomed at that point <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Stephen, I called him berserker Stephen. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"> I had a private channel with him at one point and got him to explain his motives for killing people to me. They were... Bad. That's just me opinion BUT we had so many mush that he looked like some sort of mush killing savant. He was that guy that kills humans left and right on most ships only this time the humans happened to mostly be mush because team mush was converting so many people.</p><p>He was even right about Jin though I could not follow his reasoning as to why. Funny how that works out.</p><p>Stephen almost saved the day but he also lost it. I would have been wary of transfers when the "griefer" landed and decided to stand in the dorm but Stephen just hacked away immediately. Then decided that Terrence was a griefer... Even though KT started talking for the first time in like a day right after the transfer <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> I thought for sure they would notice that but no one did. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
