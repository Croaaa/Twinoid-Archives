                <p>I was Chun on the ship. I hadn't been on such an active random ship before, it was nice, even though activity seemed to slow down near the end everyone helped get us to where we were. Except for Jin Su. I've played Chun a few times and I've never had so many people eager to talk to me, usually the mush hunt happens without anyone asking my input. I'd also never been on a mush hunt for so long, it gets pretty stressful waiting for some kind of evidence to make a move on.</p><p>I'm so active because I teach, and my class schedule is pretty light right now. I think I am in a much different time zone than most of the crew, so I was always able to put out fires when others were sleeping. I'm glad to have been able to grab a bed so often.</p><p>I'm glad we got a Biologist book, it gave me a lot more to do than usual. But as time went on, putting out fires and keeping everyone healthy was eating up all my AP.</p><p>I gotta admit, at first I wasn't sure why the last mush took anonymush, but then when we realized that it would make it a little harder to confirm if we cured them it made sense.</p><p>It was a real blow losing Hua and Eleesha, they were two of the most active members, and to lose them both on the same planet...</p>

                <p>My next ship is turning out... hopeful. Two inactives so far. And Chun is active, which is always good.

There's nothing wrong with a good Sol return but I haven't been lost (unfound) before.</p><p>Not sure what to say here. Yes, we had a pretty active crew - probably the crew with the fewest inactive I ever had. But it was rather boring. Sitting around while waiting for AP and not doing anything - in other words being a pilot - isn't exactly my favourite. Or maybe I just need more practice.</p>

                <p>Hi all! I'm back from my long weekend of drinking and hanging out with people I only get to see every few years so I finally get to comment.</p><p>Jin Su was my alpha partner and was very low level mush without much experience there. I tried to help him as much as I could, but he went through bravo dorm early on to stealth shower after pulling the first (and only) spores on the ship. If I recall, it was Hua that asked him why he went through and he basically said "I'm the captain and I can, that's why"... which we both knew was going to get him busted. After that, we chatted a bit in mush channel to see what he could do before someone finally acted and he got killed. He figured he'd rampage and take out our gold Raluca... I told him to take Janice first since between him and Janice, morale would be hard to recover. I'm not sure exactly what happened and why it failed, but when he ran out of AP without actually killing anyone, I knew I was in for a crazy-hard-mode ship.</p><p>Having Artie as our Eleesha wasn't my idea of fun... she knows me, she knows when I'm around, and she knows how to mush hunt. Having a Chao that tortured (even if only twice and one of them being at Terrence's invitation) was <em>terrifying</em>. I had so many opportunities to pull spores and with my mush level, I could have pulled lots of them! But I was so afraid that *that* would be the moment he'd wander past me and decide to torture me. (It doesn't escape my notice that the two people that made my game the hardest were both TE lol)</p><p>After JS died, I decided I'd play the long con. I was either going to get an infected return or make them start killing each other while looking for me. But with 15 active crewmembers, there was no way I could bring myself to grief the ship or rampage.</p><p>All the food testing on this ship drove me crazy. Even more so as a mush, but even if I were human it would have pissed me off. Every time I turned a corner, there was another person double eating. And buying vending machine food on day 2 just to prove your humanity? That's some sucky human proofing right there.</p><p>I kept ongoing notes for a few days that are largely "train of thought" notes along with some screenshots I thought were worth sharing. So I'm pasting those in since it gives an "as it happened" (and sometimes totally wrong) impression from my side of things.</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>fuck up 1: d5 or so. pretending to be silver, going on expos with 16hp. need to figure out how to fix that, at least no one seems to have noticed.</p><p>fuck up 2: d7 updated food on astropad in the lab. seriously afraid that I just outed myself. I guess we'll see how many people check astropad and how often. here's praying someone else updates soon to cover my update name being there, OMG THANK YOU HORUSBOYD! haxstropad to the rescue! (for the record, I kept the inventory the same, I just put Chun’s name on it)</p><p>goal: infected return to sol/eden. if I can't get that, get the humans to start killing each other off.</p><p>day 8 - I run out of gold at the end of today and looking to figure out what last skills I'll take. I took splashproof when I legitimately forgot the damned apron around day 3 and decided to take green jelly. then went to look at the wiki and regretted that immediately. I really wanted to have it for using on o2 tanks later. I've got two more skills to fill in and a very limited choice... especially now that we have pheromodem and I'm pretty much stuck to the early goal of infected return and/or extreme paranoia. but a thought hit me tonight... how utterly hysterical it would be if I took anonymush at some point when I'm usually asleep. granted, most of the crew is smart enough to check for skill loss when they inject someone with RFS, but it would be an interesting mindfuck. and since that's the only real tool in my arsenal, I'm seriously considering it. not sure yet if I will, but I might just. thinking slimetrap to round out the 4th skill just because. won't get much chance to use it, most likely, but could be fun in that same kind of mindfuck vein.</p><p>8.4 - decided to start playing with people on the mush channel. I found a website that translates into various dialects (stereotypical, over the top silliness) so I'll play with that for a while to disguise my voice. iirc, artieleesha is a big chicken run fan.. and they just happen to have a chicken run "dialect". I know what my second dialect will be! first one was an irish welcome to the mush channel</p><p><a href="http://www.spacekadt.com/20150427194826670.png" target="_blank">http://www.spacekadt.com/201504271948...</a> <br>part 1 of pm, bottom up: <a href="http://www.spacekadt.com/20150427194912987.png" target="_blank">http://www.spacekadt.com/201504271949...</a> <br>part 2: <a href="http://www.spacekadt.com/20150427194933210.png" target="_blank">http://www.spacekadt.com/201504271949...</a></p><p>8.8 I took anon and the payoff was almost immediate. surely someone will point out why he's wrong (pheromodem would show it) but stephen thinks there's a convert: <a href="http://www.spacekadt.com/20150427225034628.png" target="_blank">http://www.spacekadt.com/201504272250...</a> <br><a href="http://www.spacekadt.com/20150427235451630.png" target="_blank">http://www.spacekadt.com/201504272354...</a></p><p>Chao checking for activity<br><a href="http://www.spacekadt.com/20150427225710993.png" target="_blank">http://www.spacekadt.com/201504272257...</a></p><p>The naming of our ship<br><a href="http://www.spacekadt.com/20150427230137961.png" target="_blank">http://www.spacekadt.com/201504272301...</a></p><p>9.1 - avoiding an expedition because I have 16 health and eyes are VERY open right now for any hints. I really really really need to take some random damage or a plate or shake or something so I drop down to my 14 max and can stop hiding so much</p><p>9.8 - <a href="http://www.spacekadt.com/20150428203447776.png" target="_blank">http://www.spacekadt.com/201504282034...</a><br>Between this and Hua calling me “a gem, a shiny shiny gem”, if I had managed to talk the crew out of pheromodem, I could be golden right about now… but oh well. I’m having fun just doing what I’m doing for now.</p><p>Also, I can’t lose health for the life of me (how’s that for a touch of irony) so I decided to buy some more gold time. It’s a giveaway to be a two-skill person with 16hp on an expo</p><p>10.2 - FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK - 27% chance of illness event on expo. 25% chance of it being me. guess who got ill on expo. my only hope is to not have any health loss in desert, which is last zone on this planet so they can’t heal me. 7 fucking percent chance and it happens. guess this means I’m “passed out” for the night (which isn’t out of the question… I’m only slightly coherent due to 4 hour nap this afternoon and I’m still exhausted)... but that still makes for problematic timing. if anyone’s keeping track of when people eat, I’m due to eat again in 10.4 before I start taking starvation damage.</p><p>and of course we hit fatigue in the last zone. hua’s at 10, ian’s at 11. I’m praying that my 14 health makes it not worth healing me… though with illness, they might. crap. crap crap crap.</p><p>and I’m fucked. the first thing hua did was heal me. dammit dammit dammit.</p><p>I refuse to rampage on this ship. I’ll take the sanction if it comes before I do that. 15 awesome and active people. I won’t take the ship down… it’s never been my goal and something I’m dead set against. it sucks to know the cure is likely to get me in a few minutes, but it is what it is. I’ll die before I rampage.</p><p>ok, 7 minutes has passed since heal. maybe hua didn’t notice? is there actually a chance that the crew will miss it entirely? would be too good to be true, but crazier things have happened! (like the 7% chance of getting hit to begin with!)</p><p>25 minutes and still no cure. though hua’s the only one that’s moved so far. I do need to pass out soon so I’m sure I’ll be cured by the time I wake up, but I’m still holding out some hope. please oh please oh please!</p><p>45 minutes and still no cure. we’ll see about the morning.</p><p>Lying in bed and the brain doing what it does, I’m still not asleep over 2 hours later. I’m also not cured. BUT! My brain sometimes is crazy smart in the middle of the night when I’m exhausted.</p><p>That expo spanned a cycle change. No one really has a way of knowing which cycle the sickness happened in. It’s possible that it cured itself on that first cycle change *during* the expo, right? Also, I think anonymush might have been a stroke of brilliance. They obviously know there’s still a mush, but without that little orange reminder, I wonder if it’s still in the forefront of their minds. Hua’s smart. No way would she have missed that if there was serious mush hunting going on… even if it was the middle of the night and she was exhausted.</p><p>I might have gotten away with this. Depends if Hua told anyone the timing (if she even noticed it herself) before going to bed. Hell, I can’t even get logs because they would have been in Icarus - as opposed to Icarus Bay. There’s no log in the room of me getting sick (and there was a private log during expo that I caught gastro) to verify timing or anything…</p><p>And busted. I’m human now. It was a great ride while it lasted… now we have 15 active humans. And now that I don’t have to avoid expos, we might just make Eden <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>(except we didn't make eden because reasons)</p><p>You guys were one hell of an awesome crew. It was great playing with all of you and I was bummed that my weekend away fell when it did. Such a crucial time to have as many active people as possible, but at least able to keep myself alive with a little help from you guys. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>spacekadt it was a pleasure having you on the ship. Was a blast we litterly had everyone on the ship but i think 3 people confirmed human. As for the food testing. As far as i know one was was really thinking ofnit as testing. We where overflowing with fruit abd with the captian a dead pile of mush I had to get cre<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_water.gif" alt=":hordes_eau:" class="tid_ico">ative with managing my moral. I had to huge cat vety early on and that aliean tV did save my life. I was full stomich and if i hasnt watched the TV i would have been dead since i had a panic attack the next cycle. So i started eating bananas like a crazy person. Then we got steak.....mmm STEAK!......Did somebody say STEAK? HOLY STEAKS BATMAN! But seriously Chao took the chef book and between him and our master ninja Stephen we where swimming in steaks! Glorious and magical STEAKS!</p>
