                <p>Hey all, <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"> here! On the ship that just got back to Sol with 8 people left.</p><p>So, I log on and jump with a ship. Being a silver level 4 frieda, I decided to wait a little bit until I saw the situation with the amount of pilots on board. I was pleased to see 5 Pilots. 5!!, it was clear that Astro + IT expert was the best choice for the ship.<br>So, fairly soon after mush selection Janice made a mistake or something, I think she rampaged straight off the bat and was swiftly executed. Nothing else happened in terms of mush, but the hunter situation was pretty bad: Lots of hunters, and hull was low.<br>But wait! I hear you say, you said that there were 5 pilots on board!. Heh, yep. Roland became inactive, Hua became inactive, Jin Su's activity was intermittent/unreliable, Terrence's as well. Andie however was doing as much as they could: Fighting hunters, Piloting successful expeditions AND researching in the Lab. However, Raluca saved the day by constantly repairing the hull. Heck, she probably made a second hull with all of the repairs she made!<br>On my planet scanning side of things, I was plagued by bad luck: Constantly getting volcanoes and seismic activity zones one after the other. And then Gioele put me to shame when he just pulled out a few good ones. However, we did manage to find good planets, we found two starmaps!<br>It was as if Eden was in sight, the super computer was well on the way, along with RFS. But then, thing <em>really</em> turned south when the aracks started hurting us loads. We were just running out of time and w knew we had to go back to Sol.<br>On the second to last day, a few of us were hang out, waiting to die. with 20-30 hull and 18 hunters outside, we were literally waiting for the inevitable. However, on day change we still were alive, I think some of the hunters only just arrived. We managed to move, extended the amount of time.<br>After some close moments, we finally (on day 12!) got pilgrd active, had Kuan Ti (mush) killed a day or two before, and returned home.<br>And here are: So close to Eden, yet so nearly dead from the hunters outside! Thanks too:<br>Gioele, for being a great commander late in the game<br>Eleesha, for being active<br>Andie, for trying to do so much<br>Raluca, for being a great technitians<br>And the rest that helped us get Sol. Thanks for the interesting trip!</p>

This started out as the most active ship I've ever been on! Only Stephen was braindead from the start. Oddly though, more and more people dropped off the closer we got to Eden. I think that we were actually super lucky. Yeah we didn't get plasma shield till the end, but there were so many late cycles with no hunters. Hopefully I run into some of you in the future.</p>

                <p>Gioele here. That was my third ship with 2 starmap pieces. Maybe we weren't lucky with Plasma Shield but we were certainly lucky with artifacts. I don't think I had ever discovered a planet with 3x intelligent life, ruins and cristalite before. All we needed were active pilots, but who could have thought that 4 of the 5 pilots we had would go inactive.</p><p>Two of the 5 pilots were very useful at the beggining, at least popping in once per day, which allowed us to stock up some scrap. Raluca used that scrap to bring our hull back from the dead several times. She was like a damn whirlwind repair squad. At some point we had like 9 pieces of equipment broken and a couple of doors - she made a run around the ship and only 2 broken things were left. It was insane.</p><p>Andie was superactive and our only chance of curing Kuan Ti. Unfortunately, inactive Hua and Roland died of depression and starvation and Jin Su and Terrence were barely active, like for about only 10 minutes a day or so. They did clear the hunters when the appeared, but not before the hunters tore the Daedalus a new one every time. So only Andie was left for frequent piloting and expeditions, which denied us any work in the Laboratory. Andie did a great job and fought with the remaining active crew members until the end.</p><p>Frieda was somewhat active. She wasn't communicating often, but I think she was there most of the time. Her scans were very frequent, but her bad luck followed her everywhere, making her deliver one dead zone planet after another.</p><p>Overall it was insane how lucky we got with starmap pieces - if we only had more active pilots, we could have healed Kuan Ti, who would have helped us in our cause. If I had this much luck on the two previous ships with 2 starmap pieces, where there were really active crews with like 10 or 12 active people who just didn't find that one last piece due to bad luck, we would have surely made it to Eden.</p><p>Well, maybe some other time.</p><p>Thanks for that ship anyway and props to making it at least to Sol at the end with a hull as thin as cheddar cheese <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Yeah, I spent all of my AP scanning, just trying to be helpful after bad planet after another. I was getting runs of like 4 planets with crew death events.</p>

                <p>Totally fresh from a <a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/C0YN0M/1">Co-Op RP Casting</a> I'm left staring at the play page seeing Andie Graham taunting me.</p><p>Andie is taunting me 'cause:</p><p>1. Andie is the only character I've never been before<br>2. The season is about change taking Andie with it<br>3. I just got off a ship where I felt bad I could only fully do the RP bit a couple of hours a day<br>4. I've never been Andie 'cause Andie does All The Jobs &amp; I was worried about pulling it off!</p><p>I was right to worry. Ha!</p><p>... not because I didn't mostly manage to pull it off but because I went I reverted to my old Mush playing self of doom. Doing BS like waking up at 4:30am the <strong>1st</strong> day the Hull got down to 8 Armour to try and pick off the worst of what was about to hit us.</p><p>I agree with <strong>Gioele</strong>'s last words that this was a weird ship! It was so random with both the luck and the player activity! It was also hilarious with the fits of irony (like the Apron breaking just when we'd started to do the Serum rush and Gio later, hilariously, having to fix it when he'd brought it to R. who couldn't then, winding up dirty when he'd wanted it to stay clean to do Astro, only to find the terminal was broken when he got there!).</p><p><strong>Frieda</strong> you're lucky you got the flu and I saw it on that expo 'cause I was sure you were Mush with your crappy luck, you dotty old lady!</p><p>I also thought Jin was next most likely to be Mush (it was just him and Kuan on The List) as he was doing the most passive damage to us overall! I was genuinely relieved when he died the world's stupidest death and Gio got to be Commander. My Andie had their head totally turned by Commander Gio.. couldn't care less about Jin <em>or</em> Derek. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It is totally fitting that <strong>Raluca</strong> got the most likes so far 'cause Raluca was amazing. We kept getting to the very brink of death and being pulled back! 3 times I thought "WTF... we're not dead yet!?"</p><p>(I feel a bit bad that Chun is so apologetic in their last words. There were folks on there far less useful than Chun, and none of them made to Sol, of course. It could have just been the case that more people needed coaching on communicating well what they're doing and what is really needed on a ship once you hit the 10 day mark. I also feel a bit bad that this was Eleesha's most active ship 'cause you need better ships. Maybe the MMM will do it! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>I've never been to Eden on a non-casting ship. It's the one thing I'd like to do for sure so maybe I'll also see you on the MMM (or some other random tempting ships). I'll be back to my more regular characters (Ian and/or Paola with the well defined you-can-do-it-if-you-log-in-a-couple-of-time-a-day jobs).</p><p>Just have to see if I can tamp down that Mush playing self of doom a bit before then. Ha!</p><p>Thank you for being fun enough to re-ignite that in me even if I don't actually want it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>
