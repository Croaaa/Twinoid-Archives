within the mush group as M2, and I'm here to give a small recap</p><p>for good measure I will name mush names here<br>M1- Kuan Ti<br>M2- Hua<br>M3- Raluca<br>M4- Eleesha<br>M5- Janice<br>M6- Roland<br>M7- Gioelle</p><p><strong>DAY 1</strong>: I wasn't alive yet <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>DAY 2</strong>: I woke up C6 with a mostly active crew and 2 open spots, during late C8 selection occurred, M1 and I decided to target our gold <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> first, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> went and trapped the PILGRED console per my instructions and minutes later <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> was talking about going and updating PILGRED, that got 1 successful spore onto her (also we got 'murica guy)</p><p><strong>DAY 3</strong>: <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> and I rushed <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> in RAS during mid C8 and successfully converted her, unfortunately <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> took a rather obvious route from RC to RAS whereas I took RC&gt;RBS&gt;Engines&gt;RAS after which I took off on a scrap run to cover our tracks</p><p><strong>DAY 4</strong>: Unfortunately I feared from the start that Eleesha would spot our excursion from the last cycle (specifically <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico">'s) and when she went through RC I decided she had to be our next target, with <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> choosing <em>Infector/Fertile</em> and me being annony to cover up the existence of 3 mush, we hatched our genius plan to grab her, <em><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> would call her into RAS to investigate a strange log, at this point I would follow her in and we would get 3 spores</em> unfortunately she didn't want to go in there, so <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> came up with a different (much more risky plan) together <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> and I rushed the bridge and took down the cam, after infecting Eleesha (now known as M4) we re-installed the camera and left</p><p><strong>DAY 5</strong>: At this point most of the crew that was active was mush, our remaining targets were <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico">, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/gioele.png" alt=":mush_gioele_50:" class="tid_ico">, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico">, and Roland to infect Janice we decided to use the same plan as Eleesha, but using low morale as excuse instead of strange logs, unfortunately I forgot to mention one detail of the plan... <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> was to guard RC instead of follow, because of that the plan failed and <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> decided to remove a cam inside BD where <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> was residing, spore her then move the cam to the gardens... not to say much but <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/gioele.png" alt=":mush_gioele_50:" class="tid_ico"> killed <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico">, though he almost got away with it (also somehow Gioelle got a spore on him, never figured out how)</p><p><strong>DAY 6</strong>: In order to infect Roland who was now highly against us and encouraging food tests on me after he got sick on an expo but I didn't (i.e. he had no clue what expo events did) we pulled the same stunt we did on the bridge to capture Eleesha (M4) I defaced the logs (due to <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> generously giving 18 gold days to the mush team), <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> and I moved to infect her, I then took off in a patrol ship expecting to be found out, little to say I was not</p><p><strong>DAY 7</strong>: At this point the decision made was to infect <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/gioele.png" alt=":mush_gioele_50:" class="tid_ico"> then kill <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/chun.png" alt=":mush_chun_50:" class="tid_ico">,<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico">,<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"> and let <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"> live in order to let us repair PILGRED and get to Sol, after defacing the logs in BD to allow <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> to double spore Gioelle and convert him, after which <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/gioele.png" alt=":mush_gioele_50:" class="tid_ico"> lit a fire in RC which spread 3 times in a single cycle... after killing Chun + Andie and nagging Gioelle to not light fires and put them out, then I went to sleep and woke up on Sol</p><p>My personal besties on this ship were <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/raluca.png" alt=":mush_raluca_50:" class="tid_ico"> and Eleesha (sorry no emote for you yet) <br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/portraits/mini/eleesha_williams.png" alt=":mush_mush_tease_EW:" class="tid_ico"> except that one... eww <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/kuanti.png" alt=":mush_kuan_ti_50:" class="tid_ico"> aaas fun to cooperate with as an actually active alpha, thanks for that <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> provided some fun conversations once in a while</p>
