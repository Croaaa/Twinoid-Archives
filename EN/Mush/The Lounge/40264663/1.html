                <p>Hello, crew! I was your Chun on this voyage that we finished tonight: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4843" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4843</a></p><p>In brief: Ship returned to Sol D18C1. There were several players aboard who'd missed the MMM by a few hours, but ended up together. First mush killed without incident, some silly human play (some of it mine <img src="../../../../gfx/square/redface.png" alt=":}" class="tid_ico">) delayed the death of the second mush long enough to let him rampage and kill one person, then another by proxy (transfer). The ship looked strong anyway, and before day 10 we had two starmap pieces! And then, drought. No suitable planets, with injuries, fires, and hunters getting worse by the day. Finally we pooled the last of our fuel into a planet with intelligent life... and no dice. So we brought the serum home.</p><p>I'll probably go player-by-player later, but I must sleep first. Thanks for the great ship, guys.</p><p>I will leave this post with a <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/S3OVqcm.png?1">doodle of Janice</a> that this ship inspired. Poor thing, the bugs really loved her on expos. Good thing Kuan Ti knows his stuff. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hey there, Paoland here.<br>Just popping in to thank you guys for keeping me alive whilst I was away partying, and I hope my temporary absence did not impair our chances. This ship was probably the closest I've come to an Eden victory, and come to think about it, the transfer was probably for the best in terms of expos. Eleesha's Mush hunting duties were over, so she could spend her APs in comms.<br>With such good RNG at the start, it was only a matter of time before it would turn against us, and oh boy, it did! Perpetually broken Oxygen tanks and key doors kept everybody running around.<br>Thanks a lot for the doodle, I love the wrench on her left arm (best lucky door technician, ever!) and the smirk on her face <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It would be a blessing if I find myself on another ship with you guys, so I'm just gonna wait until the next MMM!</p>

                <p>Hey all, Janice reporting in! What a ship, I got to learn so much about the game(avoid bugs like the plague may not be an actual mechanic though)</p><p>Eleesha managed to deal with that first Alpha mush pretty quickly, I think we got lucky in that the mush on our ship weren't the brightest, because neither were we, and we lost terrence because of it. Although on the flipside we got Paoland out of it, does that balance it out? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I probably cursed the ship with bad late game RNG, noting plasma shield as the first NERON project, and scoring all those door repairs must've made NERON jealous of me, my robo technician arm could only work for so long, it was a prototype after all! I think it was amazing we manage to hold out for so long, I think the point where cycle change spawned 6 fires was the part where we started to cry though.</p><p>And no guys, Kuan Ti did NOT use the maintenance time for anything else!</p>

                <p>Relax, Janice. As attractive as you may be (yes, metal parts and all), you're a bit young for my tastes. I'm no cradle-robber <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>Kuan Ti here. This ship was quite the journey. Here's the exciting bit, for those who weren't with us.</p><p>Mush Frieda's days were numbered as soon as she picked up the hacker kit without saying anything and then continued to hold onto it. The only delay there was finding somebody trustworthy who also had the AP to do anything about it as we burned through the important anti-mush research and our lucky draw on Plasma Shields.</p><p>The real problem came when we had to take care of the second mush. Roland was a huge suspect, because he was holding onto the knife and requests for him to hand it over only resulted in moaning and griping about lost AP - despite the fact that he had made the journey to the front of the ship to help with establishing comms, and a quick word to our active Chun would have allowed him to drop it off in the front corridor with no issues. Yet there were other factors; Ian had managed to get dirty over three times in the first few days (forgetting the apron for gardening or researching), as well as posting that the latest in the day he could get on was cycle 5, so he would have trouble with the garden. And Derek had gone inactive in the engine room, the exclusive domain of Raluca, while holding on to one of the blasters. Finding mushy activity wasn't hard- the difficult was figuring out <em>who</em> was the real mush. The Hunting group was reluctant to turn this flight into a murdership, especially when there were so many active and helpful players around.</p><p>Still, we had almost set the seal on killing Roland when... Derek started to move. He headed straight to the bridge as an expedition team launched. As the ship's only planet scanner, I sounded the alert in the mush-hunting chat when I saw that dot moving, and actually had a taste of fear when Eleesha reported that he had dropped his walkie because she couldn't contact him. He appeared on the bridge, and I was prepared to flee for my life- when he checked the comms console, checked the planet scanner... and left.</p><p>Unable to believe what had just happened, I checked the tracker to find an extra dot in the lab. Aha, I thought, he'd decided to make better use of his energy to take out the research crew, or discovered that Chun was now holding the hacker kit. But he merely checked the research console, flirted with Eleesha (who was standing there in place of a camera), and left again.</p><p>Eleesha followed him through the ship, trying to get him in a PM through whispering and find out what the heck was going on. He ate (presumably to stop starving), flirted with a few more people. Eventually, he came to rest in Alpha Dorm, where Stephen the apprentice shrink, Roland the pilot, and Terrence the tech and drone wizard were resting. And there he stayed.</p><p>We were baffled. He had just blown all his AP checking on things that he could have known just by looking at the chat, and flirting with a few of the ladies. He didn't respond to Eleesha's pm, even when she invited me into the conversation. And he still had shooter points, and a blaster on his person.</p><p>At this point, it was clear he had to go. At the very best, he was a wild card uncommunicative player. At the worst, he was a mush. We quickly made a plan- Terrence stepped into the hallway and crafted the Lizaro Jungle, while I was brought a ration. And one or two hours after he'd stayed silent in the dorm, we acted. Terrence took a shot to bring down his health, then left it to me to beat the rest of the life out of him. And we stared in disgust at the crew bar as it showed another dead human.</p><p>So I picked up the blaster Derek had dropped (I was confirmed human after Frieda's death) and returned to my lair on the bridge, soaking up Paola's logistics to find us a planet. And knowing I had done all I could for now, I went to bed in real life.</p><p>The next cycle, everything went wrong.</p><p>Roland didn't waste any time. Knowing that Terrence (who aside from having a valuable skillset was an experienced and knowledgeable player) was asleep in real life, the pilot laid into him. Terrence went down, and with his death, dropped the Lizaro. Roland grabbed it and made his way up to the bridge. He used a shooter point to put a bullet in me and with his last AP, he spiked Paola and transferred into her. Paola had been saving AP for the rebel base, and the mush gleefully spent it all trying to finish me off. It was very close, but several swings missed (perhaps from unfamiliarty with the new body).</p><p>Stephen was awake. He sounded the alert in the chat with Terrence's death message and chased Roland up to the bridge- but instead of reading the room logs, he started pounding the old body. He realized too late what had happened, but he informed chat that there had possibly been a transfer, as Roland had spiked Paola.</p><p>I woke up at this point, and was in something of a panic, as I had 4-5 health left. I confirmed the transfer - Paola had been gold yet now only had two skills, while Roland had none at all. Additionally, I sounded the alert in the mush-hunting channel. The mush had access there, thanks to Paola's also having contracted a disorder from Frieda's death, and attempted to throw the others off by claiming I was the mush, but I didn't have any fear of that being believed. Instead, I contacted Stephen, who was very apologetic about his role in the disaster - he hadn't really read the logs and missed that Paola had started laying into me after the spike. I tried a shot with the blaster but missed. Chun was on and came in to take a few stabs with the knife; she missed, and simultaneously dropped out of the mush hunting chat.</p><p>I went into salvage mode, instructing Stephen to take the Diplomat book we'd gotten from Xyloph and leave the room. He was still full health, and that would keep the mush from both wasting the book and getting the ability to declare a cease-fire. Chun had already left the room, presumably to attend to her torn tongue. I resigned myself to death, taunting back when the mush taunted us in chat.</p><p>And then out of nowhere, the commander came up from the back of the ship. Jin Su set the ship into motion away from the planet, then turned around and calmly sank a few shots into now-mush Paola with the other blaster. We were saved.</p><p>After that, it was a matter of adjusting. Paola-now-Roland came back and was... well, unhappy was an understatement. They were at 3 health and starving. But after some cheering on and use of the couch, Paoland got a ration and resigned himself (herself? We never really decided) to being a pilot. Chun had indeed torn her tongue - and gotten sepsis trying to fix it - but between my telling chat that a miss had happened and her getting a hold of the post-its, she got herself sorted out very quickly. She had healed herself of the sepsis before it could do too much, then saved AP in case she had to do several surgeries. In the meantime, we learned that though torn tongue also apparently makes you deaf to main chat as well as mute, if somebody in the room invites you to a private conversation you can read that just fine. Eleesha took over comms with her IT skills and her information-gathering savvy. I returned to planet scanning, taking the medlab bed until Eleesha no longer had a use for the sofa.</p><p>We gave the sprinter mage book to Raluca, allowing her to reach any broken object on the ship with ease. Paoland took the Diplomat book, giving us an alternate peacekeeper/pilot for expeditions if Andie was away or out of energy. Terrence had given the drones pilot to go with our Magnetic Net, and they did a better job keeping the area clear than I had ever seen before. Gioele went gold and picked up Astrophysicist to help with planet scanning. We had 8 plants producing jumpkins in a garden upgraded with both the shorter-growing-time project and the extra-fruit-chance project. Things went well, for quite a while.</p><p>Hua had always been quiet. Never spoke in chat except for the pilot thread, to report kills and pasiphae trips, but she did her job. Until day 10 or so. Then she went inactive, and ended up dying from injuries where she'd parked herself in AB2 on day 12. Stephen also went inactive, though he did so in Alpha Dorm, where his shrink skill was still useful until he died of depression on day 16ish (we'd been healing starvation damage to keep him as long as possible).</p><p>In the end, it was just too much. We had two starmap fragments, but the RNG just wasn't giving us a break. No suitable planets, coupled with double oxygen tank breaks every other cycle and fires and steel plates everywhere, and nobody had the AP to keep up with it. Gioele died from injuries, getting the room-shake/steel plate combo in the refectory. Ian was almost always nearly dead where he loitered in the garden. Raluca and Chun bore the brunt of the panic attacks. Eventually, we drew a line. If nothing promising showed up by Day 16, cycle 4, we'd head back to Sol before we lost somebody else.</p><p>One planet showed up, with two intelligent life zones, oxygen, and lots of places to get food. It could keep us alive long enough to locate Eden if we found the final piece. But nothing came of it. One alien stole a post-it, the other just handed us some steaks, and I fell into the ocean and drowned. So close, and yet so far.</p>

                <p>(I didn't even know there was a post size limit. That's a first XD)</p><p>I can't say I've ever had so many feelings provoked by a single session of this game. First was frustration - the RNG was to be expected (let's be honest, when is it ever <em>not</em> like that), but we could have done so much more. If Hua and Stephen had stayed active, we would have had two more AP pools to help with repairs and heals. If Ian and Derek hadn't been so supicious, we'd have killed Roland before he took out Terrence. Either of these alone would have increased our chances to get to Eden; both would have made it certain.</p><p>But there is also pride. We worked so well as a team in the post-mush stage, and everyone who was active stayed active or gave detailed alerts to when they would be gone so we could look after them. All of you were so much fun, and I would happily jump with any of you again. There were intelligent discussions and very little floundering around aimlessly, tons of support, and best of all, chat shenanigans.</p><p>My hat is off to every single one of you. A ship well done, a game well played, and two and a half weeks well spent!</p>

                <p>Eleesha here. Such a great ship. Making a semi-trustworthy mush hunting channel was a gamble that paid off, only a few people were invited to it that were actually proven human, the rest were people that just seemed trustworthy based on their activity level and if they were acting not suspicious.</p><p>And in the early mush hunt, there were so so so many people just visiting Bravo Dorm when they didn't need to, or possibly stealth-showering <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"> . Our super research team probably saved us from paranoia, all major anti-mush research was done shortly after the beginning of Day 2. I would have been a lot less patient if our research team was slower. The only person I was 99% sure was mush was Frieda, as Kuan Ti said above. I probably waited longer than I would have liked to kill Frieda, but at that point we didn't have anybody with combat skills invited to the circle of trust (except for Derek who had gone temporarily inactive). I got lucky when I attacked her and was able to finish her off myself. It wasn't until we were in orbit when she was killed, which is the longest we could have waited to do it, since mush or not I didn't want to find out what she was planning holding that hacker kit on the bridge.</p><p>Then Roland went idle according to the Cryomodule, Derek moved, everyone got paranoid and killed him instead he was making no sense; we were afraid Derek was making his move after Frieda died, but as it turned out Derek was human and just had no clue what he was doing. Roland had a reprieve from death, used it to kill poor Terrence, and then the confusing mess on the bridge happened, and Paoland was born. Paoland took over pilot duties, and I took over comms, it was Kuan Ti that got the short end of the stick losing out on Paola's logistics.</p><p>For all the arguing he caused, I regret what happened with Terrence, since he was on top of things and kept a lot of things organized.</p><p>We got two starmap pieces fairly quickly, and we were in pretty good shape, although losing the drill meant we had to be a bit picky about our planets. Chun, Janice, Kuan Ti, and Raluca were all working very hard to keep the ship and its crew from falling apart, especially near the end. Gioele and Kuan Ti were planet scanning powerhouses, but unfortunately we lost Gioele to some unexpected injuries. Jin Su was pretty helpful too, although he wasn't overly talkative he was usually pretty quick about moving the ship when we needed him to move, which is the most important thing you can do as commander.</p><p>Andie and the research team were awesome, even getting into the glory researches near the end, would have probably completed them too if the Lab didn't break. Andie and Roland pretty much took care of us, expedition-wise.</p><p>I think we gave Ian a pretty hard time early on, although it wasn't clear during the mush hunting phase, he was a new-ish player learning the garden. I'm glad he got into it and stuck with the ship the whole way through, so props to him too.</p><p>All in all, such a great crew. It took us way to long to find that third starmap, but I guess we'll settle with saving Sol from the mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

My notes to the crew!</p><p><strong>Andie:</strong> Solid researcher, pilot, and part-time expo launcher. It's too bad most of the fruit did terrible things to people, heheh. Sorry I wasn't able to relay you as many times as I'd have liked.</p><p><strong>Derek:</strong> Inactive for four days in the engine room, and then dropped his walkie and did a grand tour of the ship before flopping into Terrence's bed. Newbie? Griefer? Clueless? The world may never know. Would have loved to have him on as a normal player, not least because maybe then our mush hunt wouldn't have misfired.</p><p><strong>Eleesha:</strong> Being part of the mush hunt for the first time helped me realize how hard Eleesha's job is. We might have all hesitated on what to do a little too much, but you always seemed to know what was going on. After Roland's rampage you slotted perfectly into the comms officer role, and were often on hand to help with tech or medical disasters when they struck. c:</p><p><strong>Frieda:</strong> Paoland shared me on the PM you and Roland had going, and it was pretty interesting. Picking up and holding the hacker kit was definitely noticed and most certainly sealed your doom. Though I ended up being very glad I never outright asked you to cough up the kit. Based on your chat, we probably would have had a double rampage on our hands if I'd just hit enter on that ultimatum I'd written. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Gioele:</strong> Super Gioele after we finished PILGRED! He took Astrophysicist for us, and helped Kuan Ti more than fill the void Frieda left at the astro-terminal. I'm sorry about the RNG when it comes to your death - several people got combo shake/plated on this ship, but you were the one who paid for it with your life.</p><p><strong>Hua:</strong> Didn't communicate in chat much, but quietly did her job for the first half of the ship. She was even starting to talk a little more before abruptly going idle in Alpha Bay 2 and eventually getting plated to death. I wonder what happened.</p><p><strong>Ian:</strong> That was a big question around the turn of Day 4: Is Ian just new, or is he a mush? We would likely have killed you after your second "forgot the apron" error, except for your character would take so much energy to kill. And Roland was still just a bit more suspicious. You did well in the garden though, as time went on. A full crop of jumpkins! The cycle we went home was the cycle when fire finally struck the garden, but luckily it no longer mattered.</p><p><strong>Janice:</strong> The fixation on the teddy bear bed made me laugh more than once, and was a fun reference to bring back into chat every now and again. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> You were an adorable Janice, and door fixer/firefighter extraordinaire! I was surprised to find this was your second ship! It was my fifth, first as Chun.</p><p><strong>Jin Su:</strong> A pretty solid commander! Not one of the super-active chatty ones, but he was <em>always</em> around when we needed him. He had to AFK out from days 12-15, and made sure to save AP/MP to transfer command as soon as possible through "inactivity." That made things a lot easier to manage in your absence, and luckily the accident RNG was kind to you overall. Apologies for going over your head with the hacker kit after the last expo failed. We decided not to risk losing anyone to cycle-change accidents, when the outcome was going to be the same.</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Our fantastic caped pumpkin man. Did a lot of quiet work planet-scanning in the ship's second half, but was still pretty active in the chat at large. I laughed at some of your RP, including your shameless flirting. And apparently you and Raluca got to hug it out when things got harrowing up there, so congratulations. And, er... bummer on the drowning. You delved too deep into hands-on planet scanning, perhaps.</p><p><strong>Paoland:</strong> An active, reliable Paola, and fortunately remained so as Paoland. I would not have been surprised if you'd ragequit after that transfer, but I'm glad you didn't. You fell pretty well into your new hunter-killing role, and were a regular fixture of the expo team. Hopefully your beau is able to handle your new body... perhaps that hair dye could help after all. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Raluca:</strong> A bit brusque and tended to only speak when necessary, but that's solidly in-character so I didn't mind (even if Terrence seemed to). I'd always breathe a sigh of relief when I logged on to find that you were on the case when fires/shorts had knocked out key equipment.</p><p><strong>actual Roland:</strong> You spotted your opportunity well. With people still recovering AP from killing our wandering Derek, you killed Terrence, took his gun, and had a decent shot at finishing off both of our bridge crew. Fortunately for us, Kuan Ti survived and we managed not to kill your old body. And then while the AP-drained bridge fighters snarked at each other in chat, our glorious leader was able to finish you off. And due to a little miscommunication when we left orbit, your attempt to waste some fuel paid off. Combined with the loss of the drill, we were forced to be picky with expos and reluctant to jump away from hunters. So while your actions didn't cripple us, their effects did continue to be felt as time went on.</p><p><strong>Stephen:</strong> Apprenticed Shrink, so both dorms were functional morale centers. That was fantastic, and while you weren't terribly active otherwise, you did pop up every now and again to take care of things that needed to be done. As with Hua, I wonder what happened when you dropped out and went fully inactive. A panic attack finally took you out, after we'd spent a day or two keeping your starving body alive.</p><p><strong>Terrence:</strong> Ah, Terrence. Very active, very vocal player who seemed to know his stuff pretty well. He was definitely missed after we lost him to the mush. His drones were extremely helpful, and gave us plenty of reasons to thank him posthumously for his hard work as the ship went on. Deserved to be frustrated at being the one guy lost in the rampage, since he'd zeroed in on Roland early. Sorry for the hesitation, dude.</p>

                <p>I felt kinda bad about how I reacted to the whole ordeal. Sure, I was pissed, but equally at myself. There was really no need for me to be so grumpy to you guys for a day or 2. I was just really looking forward to being a good Paola (both job-wise and RP-wise), and the transfer just completely threw me off there. I was really conflicted on how to RP after that, so I kinda just... didn't. I sincerely apologize if I came off as harsh or anything.</p><p>Also: Stellar write-ups and phenomenal graphics there! I wish I was half as eloquent as you guys, both in words, as in images!</p>

                <p>This was my second ship on MUSH and I must say, it's alot friendlier and more civil than Die2Nite.<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"> Ian here, sorry about the whole Apron thing at the start.<br>Really enjoyed playing with you all! It was funny, interesting and pretty intense!<br>Getting so close to the last piece of a starmap, barely surviving a ship that's falling apart [Can't thank you enough Kobb for how many times you saved me on the brink] and still managing to keep it patched up enough so that the journey could continue!<br>Not to mention all the funny moments that happened in-between and the nice conversations [and drawings] that happened during it!<br>I hope you all have as much of a wonderful time on your next ship. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>
