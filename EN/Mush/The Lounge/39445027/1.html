Just about everyone had died from our plot of suicide! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_shoot.png" alt=":mush_pa_shoot:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_pmo:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Near the start of Mush Selection, I had collaborated with my partner Stephen, and had chosen <strong><em>Green Slime</em></strong> as my first Mush skill. From there, I had effortlessly sabotaged the all the equipment in the bridge, including the Communications Terminal, Support Drone, and Camera. <br>Strategically, breaking the drone would prevent massive repair attempts within the Bridge to take place, while the Communications Terminal would prevent everyone from restoring <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico"> from the connection to Sol.</p><p>From there, I waited, and bided my time for panic to spread. Unexpectedly, after Raluca had claimed RBTurret as her hiding place, a blip had appeared on her location. I headed to CATurret to check who would be there, only to see Chun. However.....,Chun was a rampaging Griefer! At first she had attempted to kill Raluca with a dropping Morale, but as time went further, she decided to grab the knife and slit her throat herself!<img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/angry.gif" alt=":anim_bad:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Me and Stephen had plotted in how to allow Chun's rampage to end before the day, in order to further reduce everyone's morale; but had to go against this plan to avoid suspicion. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> I did however, punch her a few times. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Green-Sliming my way to victory after her <em>Death By Injuries</em>, breaking the Camera to Alpha Dorm again and again; me and Stephen had managed to convert Gioele to our side. At this point, morale was low for the humans, and a blame was flying all over the place. In a fashion all to disappointed, Stephen had died by being assassinated. It wasn't long before people had clamored together in order to try to find ways of recovering morale.</p><p>As the ship grew grim, and morale fell, Derek was hoping to get a bit of <strong><em>Action</em></strong> with Hua,to give himself full morale, and I couldn't allow that, could I? So being the best Mush i could be, I chose <strong><em>Demoralize</em></strong> to speed up his, and Hua's deaths.(Camera broken and all from some Slime) I demoralized them both after their flirtation, and ran away to the Medlab, in order to preserve Derek's chastity, I swear! Although Hua and Derek had hoped to get a bit of action, Hua had abandoned him for Roland, but nevertheless, it wasn't to be, as my watchful eye was half-open in the medlab. After that, a little less than half the crew committed was dead by suicide.</p><p>As time went on, more and more of the crew killed themselves, while some, like Frieda, died by injuries. And as I woke up from my Real-Life slumber, I awoke to a dead Gioele, killed by the hands of Roland; finally fulfilling my promise of taking over his position of commander. I was without a partner, so what would I do? <strong><em>Make him kill himself, that's what!</em></strong> I made short work of him, and Gioele's death put the final nails in the coffin.</p><p>Kuan Ti, who in his final moments, pleaded for me to "raise his morale" was gravely disappointed at cycle-change, where he died ,unexpectedly, from injuries.<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> Only me and an Inactive Andie were left on the ship, and I left her to a Suicide caused by me.</p>
