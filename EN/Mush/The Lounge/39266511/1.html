I'm instantly chosen as mush and very much looking forward to the action.</p><p>My evil accomplice is Kuan, two good mush choices and we start to work out the details of our evil plan.</p><p>I take up my role as leader and start issuing orders to begin the mush research, move items to the icarus bay and get the neron projects going, along with insisting we get the Pilgred at no more than 60% incase of evil mush.</p><p>First thing I do is jump in a patroller and use up my free shooter points, land and keep the rest of my coveted AP safe for later.</p><p>After a few cycles, I realise the alpha-dorm I'm in still has no camera, perfect oppertunity to get dirty! so I rush off, find the remaining camera, double-spore in the corridor, enter the dorm and immediately install the camera, declaring the action got me dirty.</p><p>I organise for Kuan to assist Raluca with the Pilgred, at the same time Kuan traps a fuel tank and pilgred. We get one spore on Raluca, but silly Stephen triggers the second, slowing our plan to convert Raluca.</p><p>The following day, I plan to run into Raluca's Turret just before day change, spore her, then spore her again as it flips to the new day but due to real life, I miss the window and we're stuck waiting longer.</p><p>Armored Corridors comes up in our next set of projects, I issue the new days orders for Raluca to assist getting it running and Kuan spores and traps the nexus.</p><p>A few cycles later, Raluca bumps the Armored Corridors progress and gets spore 2, around the same time as our research team finishing the Myco-alarms.</p><p>In the excitement, I rush into the nexus, relay corridors, convert Raluca and grab anonymush for myself, <strong>success!!</strong> .... however, after being welcomed to the dark side, raluca informs me that I trigged the myco-alarm in the nexus...<strong>Dammit!!</strong> Damn you Stephen for being so efficient with placing those alarms immediately after they are finished, you were so quick with it I didn't even consider to check the room before infecting her!</p><p>We immediately plan to socially engineer that Raluca can finish the last of the corridors on her own, hoping that enough cycles will pass and no one will notice the alarm... convert stephen... then more...</p><p><strong>But no...</strong> Stupid Frieda has some spare AP and decides to help out and relays the project.</p><p>Shortly after this, she asks Chun to free up a private window....</p><p>Our three active mush panic, we assume she <strong>must</strong> have seen the alarm log, must be planning to murder us all quickly. With a couple of cycles to prepare for this, I had ensured that Stephen, the main anti-mush hunter onboard was low on ap/mp, Frieda too, I made Terrence spend as many points as possible and even made Paola eat a ration to do more communications work, to limit all their options.</p><p>We assumed that the humans were going to kill us on day change, we knew Stephen was active (and no one was talking, but Terrence, Frieda, Chun and later Janice were moving around, doing things but being quiet), the Pilgred was at 45%, I missioned Raluca, Kuan joined her and they got the pilgred up to 83%, with no ap/pm left on either of them except 1ap on Raluca.</p><p>The minute the day changed, raluca used her free point, got good luck, used her 2ap and Pilgred was finished!</p><p>I immediately sprinted to the bridge and sent us to sol before the human scum could do anything.</p><p><strong>Stephen</strong> - Great job on the mush hunt, you were super active and you probably would have done an lot better if the camera had been installed (as I kept insisting) in the bridge instead of the lab from the start, as this left you all super-paranoid over Frieda/Paola for a long time, giving us at the rear of the ship more freedom to do our evil deeds.</p><p><strong>Terrence</strong> - considering how short a time we had on the ship, you did a great job upgrading all the drones so quickly and it would have been a pleasure to have converted you to the dark side should we have had the chance.</p><p><strong>Frieda</strong> - Damn you for relaying the nexus!</p><p><strong>Kuan</strong> - Excellent mush partner, well done my friend you were excellent!</p><p><strong>Raluca</strong> - Welcome to the mush! whilst your conversion was short lived, I look forward to infecting humanity alongside you!</p><p><strong>Final notes</strong><br>- as the above log says, there really was no camera in A-dorm, I really did go find it and install it, knowing it would help make me look helpful and innocent<br>- The one time I killed hunters, and the two times I did scrap recovery I did as little as possible, on the hunter kill I took off, 4 free shots, landed after killing 2 hunters. On both scrap runs I launched, gathered 2-3times, landed and left it to 'luck' to help hide my conserved AP<br>- No one ever asked about missions, a big human mistake, I was issuing them to Kuan each day to help mushieplans, always ask about missions and work out who's getting them!<br>- Honestly, none of the mush have <strong>any</strong> idea where the hacker kit was, none of us touched it, we can only assume Andie or Derek picked it up, or one of them hid it, the mush never saw it and have no idea where it actually was.</p>

                <p>Edit: I was Stephen, btw! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I am quite pleasantly surprised there's such a great thread by Jin Su here. Let me start by saying that I had some problems with Astropad, so I wasn't quite alert as I could have been.</p><p>1. The ship started off pleasantly enough with me finding that both Jin Su, Chun, Raluca and myself were pretty active.</p><p>2. Installing the cameras at the Lab was a mistake but I wasn't too concerned about it, as I did see that Paola and Frieda more or less stayed at the Bridge. It was near the end of D4 that Paola started moving around at Icarus Bay that triggered my suspicion and no work done on Xyloph DBs.</p><p>3. In truth, we had too many inactives. We had Derek, Andie, Eleesha, Paola, Roland and Gioele all acting suspicious.</p><p>4. Not asking for a mission was my mistake. But usually, I leave that to the Commander as his prerogative.</p><p>5. The only bright spot was that Chun and myself managed to finish up some of the antimush research. I was actually worried that there was already 3 or more mush around.</p><p>6. I didn't have enough AP to hide the mycoalarms. The plan was to hide one in the engine room and place the rest at the usual places. On hindsight, the main mistake was not asking Raluca to ask Ian to heal her and get rid of any potential spores. She did suspect Kuan of sporing her.</p><p>7. Anyways, I didn't really have enough AP to counter your guys evil mush plans even if I wasn't pleasantly dozing off IRL. Ah ~ too bad. Well played, Team Mush.</p><p>8. Also, you gave more credit to Team Human than you realized. Probably Frieda realized about the Mush but I don't think we were really well co-ordinated enough to finish off you guys off. Obviously, though... with Raluca and Jin Su being exposed, the jig is up so to speak as it would obviously point to Kuan Ti being the other Alpha Mush.</p><p>Hope us more active players can jump on another ship with more people this time. My current ship is even less active than this one, so sigh... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>ps - damnit, didn't even get a chance to use my fancy Apprentice skill... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Raluca here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> yeah I had been telling Stephen that I was quite confident Kuan Ti was one of the mush and I was confident he was trapping Pilgred, I went to do some Neron work and though I'm safe here as theirs a mycoalarm haha turns out the mush just missed it and turned me anyway. If you could see the mush chat when I pointed out the mycoalarm had gone off and Jin Su was saying 'quick fill up the logs everyone relay' it was hilarious.</p><p>But oh well I was mush now and wanted the rest of the crew to join us so we told everyone that I could finish the project on my own tomorrow and hoped no one would go in the nexus. Stephen already had 1 spore so our plan was to get him to relay pilgred for us, Jin Su or Kuan Ti could trap pilgred and as he relays I would spore and turn him, it would have set off a mycoalarm but no one should be entering the engine room so we thought we would get away with it again. With super active (and trusted) Stephen on our side we could have made a real mess. We would of got away with it too if it weren't for a meddling granny.</p><p>An early return to Sol with 3 mush and 2 of them being Raluca and Jin SU is far too easy and Its not the way I would have wanted things to go but you forced our hands .... or tentacles or hmmm whatever mush use.</p>
