                <p>Dear crew! <br>Your commander Jin Su speaking here! <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/jinsu.png" alt=":mush_jin_su_50:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Our ship was finally destroyed: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8442" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/8442</a></p><p>Ian may tell when it was exactly, I think it was day 12,cycle 1.<br>And so Ian could fulfill his prophecy, he said after everything seemed hopelss and only 4 people were left: "Let's go to day 12."<br>Yeah, you did. And you did fine, I am very amazed about such a determined player <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>But back to the beginning.</p><p>This ship started promising with me as commander! Eh...not for a long time (hull incident) <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>In beginning my RP involved practically promoting every person who did something fine.<br>And kind of degrading people who didn't. I hope I didn't overdo it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So..Raluca ended up as the ship's janitor, she herself felt very angry about it and flipped when anyone was reffering to her as that. But it was fun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Then a bigger wave of hunters came, just at the time when I was offline...for a long time and when I returned we had only 25 hull left xD <br>This was totally absurd, anyway, also with my help we managed to get shortly afterwards plasma shield + hull back to 100 and this situation was solved perfectly. I would like to promote me because of such an achievement. Just kidding <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Shortly afterwards our ship turned a bit into a murdership unfortunately, though it did involve only the, well, rather not so chatty people.<br>Stephen was killed after saying he got dirty cooking and ppl killed him when he didn't answer why he ate ( I guess he was offline), then the killer of Stephen was killed, then the killer of the killer of Stephen was killed, then the killer of the killer of the killer of Stephen was killed xD<br>Maybe I forgot someone, anyway, Andie was last killed here, this killing I did and I don't regret it since she didn't communicate before killing and hurted also another person. At least we also got less suspects therefore..but it turned out that this may not have been so good, maybe it pushed the mush also into more pressure.</p><p>Unfortunately Janice died also of starvation and I became the only morale source. This was critical. <br>And the mush knew it well.<br>Around day 5 Roland checked himself in mycoscan and found the 2 spores, he eliminated them, checked Alpha bay and got another one. So we found out that mushes used trapper here.<br>And our only 2 suspects who could have done that were Kuan Ti and Terrence.<br>Not even a full day later, Terrence went out and he planned and executed his rampage pretty well: killing me, killing Kuan Ti with use of transfer and killing the cat Schroedinger, so Raluca died too and therefore humanity's hope of pilgred.<br>His mush partner Hua helped him a bit and so the key members of the ship died, leaving 4 people to struggle against their inevitable destiny.</p><p>I remember talking in mush hunt channel previously about " maybe I shoudl stay with Ian, though that means less Ap." I let me convince that mushes don't rampage here..Argh, I shouldn't have let me influence like that.</p><p>So mushes made a perfect rampege. Still, a great achievement of the humans, to hold out THAT long, just the lack of certain skills made it impossible to finish pilgred, but..<br>every loss is different and this human loss was indeed glorious!</p><br><p>I am sorry, that I couldn't be more online during that ship though I took Jin Su.<br>I took him only because I am fine with that character and everyone else in my selection I didn't want to play, also most Jin Sus are more inactive or at least less experienced, so why not? ^^</p><p>I didn't elaborate the story as much as I could, I hope it is still nice to read that rather short story.<br>I enjoyed the RP of this ship and many people playing there.<br>It was fun! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I hope to see some people of the ship coming by!</p>

                <p>Transhumanist Terrence - to - Gioele here, and I said it in my last words but I will again reiterate my apologies for resorting to somewhat formulaic rampage tactics. You had us locked down pretty tight, and though my partner Hua meant well she was unable to do much in the way of extracting/spiking and without access to infector things were very difficult for me - couple this with a crew that was clearly paranoid after the little 5-human death fest and my activity was locked down pretty tight. You even forced me to take trapper, a skill which I rarely ever take unless I'm on maximum caution mode <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I spent the first 4 days trying to find a crack in your defences to convert someone without pointlessly blowing my cover, but it was difficult. All the people who started off with one spore were either unreliable (Janice for example), inaccessible, or poor choices for partners (Bridge crew, with no excuses for dirtiness). So I went for what seemed like the best bet - Roland. With both me and Hua being pilots, it was fairly easy to coordinate trapping to ensure that Roland was the one who got them, and for a while things were looking promising, just needed one more spore to finish his conversion...</p><p><strong><em>And then along comes mycoscan and mycologist Ian, BYE BYE SPORES</em></strong>, and I'm back to square one, except now with a mycoscan and a heightened crew paranoia to contend with. I started considering alternatives but my skills had been mostly chosen already - Splashproof, Fertile, and Trapper, with the last space left over for whatever emergency skill I felt necessary. So if I wanted to go for a rampage (which was quickly becoming the only way I could see of even denting the ship's progress), it would have to be efficient, targeted, and meticulously coordinated. Once JS announced he was going to hold a large morale session in one of the dorms I decided to act sooner rather than later - made easier by the fact that the dorm I was in caught fire the cycle after his announcement.</p><p>We agreed that KT and Ral (the only engineers beside myself), and JS (the only remaining morale giver) were the prime targets. Fortunately, they were all located within close reach of us, with the exception of Raluca who was off sniffing plants in the Garden at that point I believe (no idea why). But we had decided to avoid wasting AP on chasing Raluca down, instead relying on Schrodinger's death and the deaths of the crew to critically depress her.</p><p>I had full AP with Terrence and had calculated Gioele as my best target for transfer - by my calculations he was the only immediately accessible character with a full AP supply. The original plan had been for me to kill JS and KT, who I was in a dorm with at the beginning of the rampage, run to IB to build Old Faithful, then run to the other dorm, transfer to Gio, take solid, and mow everyone down in a glorious blaze of rapid fire. Unfortunately, KT proved a tough nut to crack and I ran out of AP before taking him out, and had to skip on Old Faithful. Transfer to Gio went through without issue and I asked Hua to take down my old body which was already low-ish on health. Again, a glorious show of bad luck left Hua with less AP than calculated (She was supposed to run off to the Lab to murder the cat), so I asked her to finish off KT, who was probably about one hit from death. That didn't work either, and I had to go and finish the job myself with Gioele's meaty fists.</p><p>Looking somewhat low on AP myself, I was determined to take out the cat even if it meant I had no AP left to defend myself with. I ran to CC (where with great foresight I'd hidden a blaster 3 days earlier), grabbed it, and went to lab. Boop, cat dead on first try. I decided to unload the rest of my AP on Chun who was there in the lab as well, but she stubbornly refused to expire, so I was left standing in the Lab, 0/0, with no way of defending myself. I could have saved up to run off in a patroller but it would have served little purpose: 2AP wasted on letting them kill me with minimum AP expenditure. So there I stood, while Frieda, Chun, and even Ian took their turns smacking me silly, until I eventually died, content in the knowledge that I had at least made things very difficult for the remaining humans.</p><p>Honestly, I was impressed you managed to hold out that long, must have been an eventful last few days <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hello everyone! Gioele-to-Terrence here! I've not got much to say other than delivering pats on the back!</p><p>Mushies, specifically the one who stole my precious body: Great job with timing of your transfer! Had you done it 5 minutes earlier or later, I would have been online to scream bloody murder and essentially ruin your plans! It may have been luck on your part, but everything went down while I was at choir, and that just means no signal. And, just so you know, we (the mush hunt) predicted your transrampage, but had rather hoped you would wait until the following cycle. I was quite surprised to return to a death screen, with a completely different name.</p><p>Human friends: You were the best crew I'd had in a long while, and still remain my best crew since. I enjoyed everything we did, from my being the first one awake to my body being stolen to rampage (I was actually fairly low on AP, if I remember properly). I regret my spotty activity, due to school, but am glad for what help I provided.</p><p>I'd like to cordially invite everyone from the ship who does not have a casting to join RP or Die. As I think that accurately describes the events of our ship.</p>

                <p>Hey, folks, Ian <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"> here!<br>Most of the things about events were already said, so I'll stick to my point of view and random babbling about things that just come to my mind.</p><p>For starters, let me rant about how I hate playing as Ian. For two reasons.<br>Firstly, whenever something interesting, i.e. fight, happens on the board, Ian is always left out. Being one of the lowest priority targets for rampage and one of the worst people to do something about killing his adversaries, his usefulness is all about moving between rooms to block the enemies and get the hell out when the friendlies go in. That makes me feel useless and too dependent on others, most of the time.<br>Secondly, I still didn't find a satsifactory way to roleplay him. I can't imagine Ian to be very vocal character and permanently stoned weed-smoker streotype, which I see too often around, isn't really my way of doing RP.<br>But well, I have my own rules concerning picking the characters and it was Ian's turn this time.</p><p>So I had to pick some appripriate RP for my current Ian. After some options weighting, I went for neurotic/craven pacifist. Which was actually okay, for first few days. As the crew was mostly competent and chatty, I haven't felt the need to get out of the character for bossing them around. I just (mostly silently) tended to my plants, research and healed some people with starting spores. Those were great times. Also thanks to Paola for helping with the trees, left me more APs for research, which were sorely needed. Her untimely death was a big loss for our garden.</p><p>Sadly, mush rampage changed this greatly. As expected, I couldn't do much about that. I just went to guard Chun so Gioele can't finish her. Which, as I now see, was too late and unnecessary, anyway. At least, I tried my best to make the situation as least confusing for other humans as possible and to keep the rest of the crew informed, calm and focused on priority of getting rid of mushes.</p><p>After we managed that, there was not much space for any more cowardly RP. We had no technicians (not even potential ones), Pilgred was at 26% (We should have listen to Raluca. Maybe. But that could prompt mushes to Pilgred rush instead of rampage. Always hard call.), there were fires on board and hunters all around the ship.<br>Luckily, Hua stole "only" medikit when fleeing in patroller and we found all extinguishers, eventually. Frieda learned how to fly a patrol ship and with Roland managed to keep the numbers of hunters sensible.<br>The main problem turned up to be Pilgred. And probably lowering activity of the most of the crew. Which is understandable. With 148 AP needed just for Pilgred, math was clearly not on our side and I can't blame others, if they lost hope for happy ending and motivation to be around and organize for more effective Pilgred relaying and emergencies solving.<br>Even with that, we were able to get Pilgred at 52%, and stay all alive till Day 9, when the loss of medikit got apparent, after we lost Roland to steel plate. At the start of Day 11, both Chun and Frieda died of depression (panic attacks, probably, as me and Frieda were doing the thing daily) and I was left alone. I tried to carry on as long as possible, and stayed alive till D12C1, when I followed Roland's fate. Not that I would stay alive much longer - I was down to 4 oxygen and 12 armor, there were 29 hunters outside, and most of the equipment was broken, including both fuel tanks and combustion chamber.</p><p>All in all, I think this was pretty interesting ship. I'm also glad that we managed to get the casting tickets, because I think most fo the crew deserved them, in my opinion. I gave surprisingly lot of likes for the random ship.<br>And I'm also happy to have Ian off my to-do list for quite a some time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Well, that's easy to do on fully active or very inactive ship. On the first one, you have Finola/Andie to push the research, and on the second one, research just doesn't go fast anyway, so there's a plenty of space for not having APs when you don't have anyone to relay with. But when you end up being the only really active person with research bonus with lots of relayers and also the one to take care of all the plants, APs start to be stretched too thin. Not taking a bed would be quite suspicious in this situation, as it would slow down research considerably - almost reportable for human, if you ask me.<br>Paola taking botanist helped tremendously with this. For one day. Then she died.<br>Of course, with 20/20 hindsight, staying (i.e. standing, because we had trouble with pilots not having beds anyway) in dorms would be much better. But you don't have that hindsight, shipside.<br>Also, I think, if we wouldn't pushed the research so fast and I wasn't staying in medlab to be able to heal spores off people at any time, I don't think there would even be <strong>any</strong> rampage. We would just do mycoscan too late for Roland to find out he's being slowly converted, I guess.</p>

                <p>Hua here.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/cool.gif" alt=":anim_cool:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Huh.. never knew this is the old messages...Though is a very old messages.. Just realize this forum relates to the mush plays.. Well since this is a old messages.. Might as well hit the stories.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/cgu.gif" alt=":anim_chart:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The original plan from Terrence is when He (Terrence) to killed Jin-Su and Kuan with the Lizaro Jungle &amp; Blaster and have his body to be switch with Gioele at AD while the camera to be switch off by himself also to try creates a diversion which I have to be a bait to be killed by you guys after the murder while Gioele (been transfer) will take his roles into killing more as he have mentioned from his post...</p><p>But failed as Kuan is hard to killed as my mush partner have mentioned also the cam is on so is quite obvious for Roland to notice these logs... So I killed Terrence as planned. It took almost 8ap to killed that old body of yours, Terrence.. Seriously you should have taken more shower damage. Btw is all the RNG lucks that I couldn't complete the missions have planned, I tried. After the murder of Terrence.. I was given another mission to killed Kuan that my partner failed to kill.. Kuan seems to have more health when I hits him three times but least there a pilot magebook in BD... So Gioele/Terrence helps me to killed. So in the end Gioele came to lab to killed a cat in my place and other plan to attempt murder on Chun which I never know of.... I assume Gioele to read a pilot magebook and runs with sometime in his hands but well people have different views in hands..</p><p>So my only slots to put is Hard-Boiled skills as this only to buy me some time to try steal the bed in the last seconds.. I have predicted Roland will be up and he will try to killed me.. From his hunters defence.. I assume he should have 6 or 8 ap but seems to taken some extra boost rations which luckily the RNG is my sides if not Roland would have killed me... So I wait on next cycles change, it really stress me out during the change cycles.. And boy do I have a plan to sabotage the ships more..</p><p>I had my taste to sabotage the ships more if I have more space to take but talkies seems more important to chat..The truth is that I have taken pilot magebook not only the medikit <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">. I try to makes this ships more restricted for you last 5 survivors in ships journeys but I didn't expect my death results another chain victim for last Tech, Raluca.. Hooray for mush..*Ahem* So basically.. I have 2ap from AD bed cycles and 8mp.. My aim is to take the wrench &amp; medikit but the wrench is at AB2 and medikit is at Lab so which makes my counter-measures on mp to take wrench or medikit.. both to choose in one route.. So I weight my pro &amp; cons on these two choices.. Wrench can be taken and makes harder to repair and ap consuming without tech skills.. That's what wrench do.. But the medikit or UMP (if completes the research) are more annoying than wrench which allowing to heal 4hp and is also is very convenient in any places during accident events.. So I decided to take the medikit hoping to create which allowing a coordinate survivor to heal each other by 3ap and ap/mp converting together. Which makes you guys more harder to coordinate with task more.. I should have taken the apron as well to restricted more but three slot.. What can I do.. All I have is Pilot Magebook, Medikit, &amp; Talkies.. Atleast pilot magebook prevented the 2nd or 3rd pilots to collect scraps or hunters defense..</p><p>To be very honest, is hard to extract the spores when the crews is on high alerts and have to give a excuse.. And I couldn't find any excuses to extract with nor any chance with this high alerts &amp; security around.. I know my task as pilots.. And boy.. I was hoping to pretend to be inactive and lets the ships hulls destroy but your hero, Stephen steps up and repair the ships. Which makes me abit annoy.. So I wait and watch while running my task to collect scraps &amp; hunters patrol.. Not until Terrence chat with me and checked up with me..</p><p>Well, I never expect the 4 crews survive this long.. I was watching you know, Ian.. even my death.. But you guys really hard to crack <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_city_up.gif" alt=":hordes_evo:" class="tid_ico"></p>
