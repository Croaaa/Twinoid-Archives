                <p>Hi, <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"> Eleesha here,</p><p>That game just finished:<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6861" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/6861</a></p><p>We returned to Sol 15 minutes before cycle change with only 1 oxygen unit left, I am glad, that in the end there were enough people active to make that wonder happen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I also have to admit that it was a dirty game, so if anyone here wants to know why some killings happened or such stuff, feel free to do that. I hope/wonder whether someone will even find that ap-thread.</p><p>Long story short: we had much lab-idlers who died quickly of starvation, because they didn't finish tutorial, oxygen was running low, hull was running low, notv enough time to know exactly who is mush, also my list was worthless (printed it after first mush was dead and it included first mush) and therefore... and that is the dirty part, some people died innocent-until I killed last mush, we finished pilgred and Hua hacked us to Sol just in time...</p><p>All active people helped the ship and that included Raluca, she blamed Terrence for getting dirty because of not using apron, did exactly work at pilgred as we wished and didn't try to finish it and return to sol, so I thought long time she would be human...</p><p>I had private conversations with Stephen and Andie where we decided waht to do, bounded and gave us strength to survive this mess <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>All wrong killings and my thoughts regarding them:</p><p><strong>Roland</strong>-I saw your angry message at me in endscreen, but when i killed you, I saw already pretty low activity, you were inactive lying on a bed with NO skill. and doing nothing at all so far. So I don't really care about being wrong here <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Frieda</strong> - similar problem like with Roland. after finding that planet, which was probably even before mush selection you didn't do much, got inactive status and stayed inactive in Nexus. so... that wrong kill was also probably not such a problem... But without your planet, which gave us 8 oxygen at least, we wouldn't have been able to win in the end, so thank you very much for that!</p><p><strong>Terrence</strong>-now the only kill where I really want to excuse myself that it happened. In private chat with Stephen and Andie we talked about our options: we had only very few oxygen left, so only chance was to kill the mush... Then I wrote my characteristics of every person who was no confirmed human, that was: Janice, Raluca and yourself.<br>Because Janice informed me about Ian and repaired camera instantly without getting dirty she seemed most likely human.<br>I didn't catch a log of you eating, but a log of Raluca eating, that was a bit bad for you besides getting dirty because of not using apron and finishing anabolics. I noticed your participation at strong antimush research, but Raluca seemed to be helpful too.<br>You had only drone expert, whcih wasn't as helpful als Raluca's skillset unfortunately, so that was probably also a reason...</p><p>So I offered in private chat to andie and stephen either to kill you or Raluca first and was open to discussion. well, we had no discussion afterwards, but would maybe also haven't change anything, then you were killed.<br>You were our sacrifice, so we could get the real mush and return to sol. Plz don't be mad at us for not being better, I think Raluca did a good job of pretending to be helpful and stay out of radar...</p><br><p>we had many inactives, but in the end it was an intense game and our win makes me as proud as reaching eden with an active crew <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
