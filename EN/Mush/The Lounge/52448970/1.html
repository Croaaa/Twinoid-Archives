                <p>Hello <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I see that many of You already showed Yourself in this thread... I am glad to see that! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Guess what? It is STORY TIME!!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Little reminder though - it is STORY TIME, and not HISTORY LESSON, ok? So there will be little mistakes, little forgetting and so. Keep that in mind <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As You know, we will be talking about THIS ship:<br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9028" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/9028</a></p><p>Who I was? You know it already, but it is important to introduce myself properly...</p><p>Alpha Mush <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico"> here. Later transferred into <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/janice.png" alt=":mush_janice_50:" class="tid_ico"> and cured with Retro Fungal Serum.</p><p>Now... How do we start? Why? With begining of course!!!</p><p><strong>My life before Mush Selection...</strong></p><p>-</p><p><strong>Mush Selection and first glance on my ship...</strong><br>Surprised? Nothing written in my previous part of post, and that looks odd? I will tell You why! That is because I was LAST person to land on this ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> It was missing only Andie... Character which I like very much... So when I saw it I thought - WHY NOT?! And decided to jump on ship, knowing that few friends of mine were there as well... Jumping there as Andie was a MUST for me actually <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So here I jump and... And first surprise for me - I am immidietly informed that I am <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>Ehh... Usually I am VERY glad to be an Alpha Mush, but on this paticular ship I didn't wanted that to happen. Not when I was last person to get on board (I like when ship is filling for about a day after I am joining it as I have time to have a look at it and feel more comfortable with it's crew), and what is MORE important - not second ship in row. On my previous ship I was Alpha Mush Eleesha. So here I was Mush second time in a row <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Ok! Never mind that! So I am a Mush... Ok... Ok... Yea... But who is my Alpha Partner? I was SO HOPING that it will be <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/eleesha.png" alt=":mush_eleesha_50:" class="tid_ico"> (Sperbi)... I check on Mush Channel to see who it is and... Boo! Some <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"> is my Alpha Partner... But ok! Let's not despair immidietly! Let's check on forum... Let's see how active is She! Hmm... Let me see... Let me see... WHAT?! No! No! No! Frieda's last message was ages ago! Looks like somebody who is active immidietly after jumping on ship and than stops being active... Damn! So my partner was not only Frieda that is supposed to stay on Bridge and be clean all the time, but also seemed rather not that active... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> And whole ship is ULTRA active! Everybody was doing something, something usefull! By the time I managed to go through all disscusion aera Mush Sample was already in Lab... I was hoping to bring it in personally to gain that one credit of trust...But NO! It was already in Lab.</p><p>Ehh... With sight of resignation I wrote in Mush Channel to ask Frieda if She will be active and what is Her Mush Level... That was an act of desperation...</p><p>BOOM! Answers comes in after 15 minutes of waiting!!! Yes... It was THAT fast! And what I have learned than? Three things! Firstly that my Alpha Partner Frieda is lvl 11 Mush - which are great news for me! Secondly that my Dear Alpha Partner Frieda is actually active and was offline for longer time because she could not for some reasons, but now it will change... That was even GREATER news! And than third thing was that my Beloved Dear Alpha Partner Frieda was dnever an Alpha Mush before <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> Well... That ment She will be openminded, so it was also kind of positive <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So to sum up - I had very active ship, but my Mush Partner was also very active player <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> In 15 minutes my worries about Frieda were totally cleared out <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>15 minutes of waiting well spent...</strong><br>Now... After I sent message to <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/frieda.png" alt=":mush_frieda_50:" class="tid_ico"> I waited for about 15 minutes for Her reply. What was I doing during that time? I managed to check on almost every person on board for starting spores... Now, listen to THIS! Eleesha, Stephen, Raluca all had 1 starting spore! I didn't knew about that back than but Paola also had one starting spore. So that ment 4 crewmembers had spores in and could be easily converted... Honestly? I thought about rampaging right at start of game. Before any research would be done... As infector I could easily convert 2 hummans into Mushes on day change and I could hope that they will manage convert also somebody... And... Frieda would be still hidden... But I scrapped that idea as it is not my cup of tea honestly. I decided that long game will be more interesting...</p><p><strong>First plans with Frieda...</strong><br>To my delight Frieda agreed that we will be better off if we will look humman and see when occasions will present themselfs for us to act. We choose to stay hidden for now. Since Frieda was already lvl 11 Mush, we could afford to let hummans make AGas and CSerum easily. And to stay hidden I actually HAD to help them (lvl 4 Andie made me main researcher after all). Frieda in same time concentrated on finding good planets for hummans to explore...</p><p><strong>First trouble...</strong><br>First time when I thought that I might be found as Mush and killed before doing anything really was when Chun (Technolass) contacted me and asked if I can eat in order to work bit more on research. I refused saying that it would comfirm me humman too easily as I never entered BDorm so could not extract spores and phagocyte... I put all my AP into research already and got Mission from JS that was worth 6AP and also went into research so I hoped that despite my refusal I did brought eoungh trust that I will not get killed immidietly... And I was not - which is good. But Chun never forgot that I refused to eat and I was on a radar from now on.</p><p><strong>Research going too fast...</strong><br>I don't know how exacly fast it was, but I must tell You that Chun, Ian and Eleesha made sure that we will have AGas, CSerum and half of MAlarm done by time when I woke up very next day... Myco Alarms were done at evening of same day... And that third research was done without my participation as I offered to gather all scrap from few hunter waves - at full AP and with mission I could collect really a lot of scrap. And I did! That pile of scrap made it possible for Terrence to build second drone and upgrade both to Turbo. And we still had some scrap left! But in this moment I realized that longer it will take, harder it will be to do any mushy actions. And I knew that I had no reasons to visit BDorm at all... And after refusing to eat when asked by Chun, any entering into BDorm would be fatal for me... I hoped that humman team will show possible oppening rather sooner than later...</p><p><strong>OPPENING!!!</strong><br>It took another day for hummans to finnaly show reliable oppening... Do you remember that Raluca, Eleesha and Stephen (and Paola - but unknown to me) had 1 spore from start? All of them had been right now in same room as I was... We all were in Alpha Dorm... From a long time. I could see they had a lot of AP to spend... And Janice was also with us... And also had for sure tons of AP about that time... And so I crafted VERY carefull plan that would create MINIMUM 4 beta mushes (in addition to Frieda and me) that would all be in good condition and all would be protected by Case Fire for 3 more cycles... With one or two more conversions possible after Case Fire (depending on Mush level of all 4 Beta mushes and starting spores status of those crewmember that I didn't knew about). That would be blow this ship could not take without serious problems...</p><p>So... Why I didn't went for it? Answer is simple - Fried could not due to things happening in real life for Her <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> So I decided to postpone it for one day... After all what is a one day in Mush? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Tommorow I will write next part of my story... And You will learn what diffrence may make one day of waiting...</p>

                <p>Hi Hi! Raluca turned Frieda here.<br>I can't even begin to say how amazing everyone were. Like literally everyone! <br>Everyone did everything they could to the best of their abilities and thats all I could ever want out of a mush game.</p><p>When I first started this game I thought I'd just hang out near the engine, maybe work on the plasma shield if that happened to pop up. Then probably be turned mush and/or die as is standard for Raluca. <br>Being turned into Frieda kinda gave me a new purpose on the ship. Especially now that all the mush were taken care of and we were in such a good position. I really enjoyed my time on the bridge searching the stars with Jin and Paola. You were all so friendly and nice.</p><p>And Roland you were the perfect first timer. Its rare to get the chance to go to eden, or even last 20 days, so I'm glad you were able to take part in it.</p>

                <p>Ok, some part of story out of my point of view, a bit from mush hunt and I will stop around the time when Europa stopped with her part.</p><p>This game started already pretty quickly. I think at day 1 cycle 8 was already mush selection and half of people awakened not much earlier.<br>First thing I did as usually was hurrying and looking for the mush sample and so I went off.. to the back of teh ship, moving and moving around and finding nothing.<br>Until I foudn out that Chun found a book and the sample at front of ship already <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>So ap wasted...anyway, these things are in humanity's hand, so first advantage for humanity checked!<br>During my walk I also found the knife and hid it already, informing Chun about its location. <br>Unfortunately it seems this action could have meant my end if people weren't careful.<br>Chun missed my message of knife location and Derek looked as first thing he did in trade offer and noticed the knife in a storage room.<br>So he looked for it and didn't find it sicne I hid it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>He asked Chun and since she missed message, he searched for the knife and found it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"> So much activity was there.. In the process Derek ate and got dirty though, so rather unfortunate. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway, i returned to lab and helped a bit relaying research, maybe one or 2 times, most ap I used up already by running around <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Andie helped from beginning, from her participations it was visible she used all or almost all Ap up there. Also we managed to finish constipaspore already. <br>Then Chun made high efforts to gather people also working at Antispore gas, she wanted to finish it at end of cycle 8 too, with eating if necessary. Andie went to Adorm and didn't want to help further with research since eating would out her as human or mush.<br>Personally for me that was only slightly odd, I can understand this decision and would probably do the same in her place when I were human.<br>(More interesting was to me that while speaking privately with Andie she made a joke which gave the impression she is scared of something <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> )</p><p>Personally I also considered constipaspore right after selection and before first day change as fine enough, so Chun's pushing and my hesitation to help with eating probably made me suspicious too. I helped in the end since my moving around may make AP counting eventually a bit harder.<br>But other people liek Jin and Ian were more easy to count, so after that research session it was already pretty sure to me that Ian and Jin were besides Chun human.</p><p>The following days I just went aroudn the whole ship, avoided to get dirty at all and looked for logs to find something suspicious.<br>But everything i find was mostly false alarm:<br>Actually my biggest suspect was Janice!<br>Reason for it was that right after mush selection Janice went through medlab while Frieda was lieing there unprotected, then she went to lab and<strong> did nothing there</strong>, before returning to <strong>Bravo dorm</strong> , then changing some parameter in Nexus and then going to bridge, where Paola was unprotected to help with signal and return afterwards again to <strong>Bravo dorm</strong> (Gioele came shortly afterwards to install his paranoid cameras at bridge). Mh.... as you see..it can always mean false alarm <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Andie got a little bit my trust when she alarmed me about getting a coffee from Gioele and I should check whether he had opportunity to spike it, but sinc ehe confided in here it was visible that Gio could not have done that.<br>When I needed some moral I also confided in her and stayed in Alpha dorm then. <br>Around that time Chun shared with me a confidant log of Janice, she got from Andie.<br>This was interesting, because I noticed here "Pick Up" as an action and that seemed totalyl odd to me!<br>I never saw a pick up as action when I tortured people and so I really thought: maybe Andie faked the confidant log! But on the other site...WHY wpoudl she do that? Why would someone add a pick up? Faking it woudl be easier by just leaving the mush actions out, so that was a riddle to me... <br>And So I tried to solve it, first by picking something up and confide again in Andie. From Chun I got information that this time the pick up action doesn't show up! So... I look again at the old cnfidant log and ..HEUREKA! It has to do with the cat! Is the pick up action of cat different? <br>The next time I was in lab I noticed the following:<br>The action of pick up has a different formation than the normal pick up action:</p><p>cat: <strong>P</strong>ick<strong> U</strong>p.<br>normal: <strong>P</strong>ick up</p><p>Soo..the cat pick up is a separate action , which makes sense actually since it has special properties, it means more often hurting and spiking when cat is spored.</p><p>So that riddle was solved and in that moment Andie seemed rather fine to me and Janice was rather cleared too, though she didn't use that mcuh ap, probably burned by moving around often though <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>At least to me, suspects were therefore at that time: , Hua, Janice, Frieda (only because of not using that much ap, but actually only small suspicion <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> ), maybe Gioele, Derek, Raluca.</p><p>Oh, there was another threat: Since we had plasma shield up, Raluca was staying in a bed and she pumped up full ap to use them at plasma shield efficiently. But actually Chun and I were really frightened she may prepare for a pilgred rush and so we were really curious whether she would use them all for plasma or not, in any case we had to be prepared. eh..actually all glory goes to Chun here.<br>Since it was pretty late in RL, I just went to bed while she had still the courage to stay awake and guard the front corridor some time before Kuan Ti and Raluca agreed to work together at pilgred.<br>I am not sure whether anyone else noticed it.<br>She stopped guarding then afzter plasma shield was done and Raluca immediately went to a location without bed, making her much more trustworthy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>well, I think we are now at end of day 2/begin of day 3 and I stop here for now.</p>

                <p>Hm, I decided to tell a bit more, since there is not that much to tell for me left before the mush action happened.</p><p>That cat incident in combination with pick up I actually wanted to double confirm, so I was picking up the cat and cinfiding in Andie at end of previous day. <br>Not too strangely, but a bit strangely this time Andie did not share the confidant log with Chun. well, there were not much more actions, but normally she was always sharing every log with Chun, but... it may be she was just in hurry for going to work. so fine.<br>During the day we managed to finish the mycoscan and as soon as mycoscan was finished I also was already hurrying to lab and checking myself: 1 spore. <br>OK<br>Now I told Chun about it and suggested we work on a research like spore sucker or super soap..well, Ian and Chun thought that it is more important to get rid of it as soon as possible and therefore Ian, who was pretending to be a bronze botanist picked as second skill mycologist and now they wanted to heal me.<br>What was irritating me was that Chun just pretended to need my scooter and took it, but she didn't use it and just hold onto it. well, I argued as hell to get the scooter back <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">, then hurt myself with cat so Ian could heal me and checked cat also by doing that - not spored. <br>Afterwards I went to medlab and Ian healed me, removing my spore.<br>Back in lab and checking to be spore free I also realized that Derek was still doing nothing.<br>His last action was over a day ago, so he was almost at full ap!<br>Chun told me he was saving ap in case of rampage but....that is dangerous, since he may also be good transfer target even when not being mush by himself, she was aware of that too and wanted to try getting him doing something...in meantime I thought about how to protect me a bit.<br>Btw I realized at that time that Europa/Andie was still not online which was very unusual. If nothing is coming up in her RL she was usually online during that time...but who can know that for sure, right?</p><p>So especially the Derek incident lead to me going to medlab near Ian's presence. Here I stayed and wanted to wait some time until at least Derek used his ap.<br>Then I actually planned to return to lab or so.. but</p><p>RL happened!<br>((I got asked whether to watch a movie in a location where they showed it for almost no entry fee (btw it was Gone girl <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> ) so I was away.))</p><p>well.. it seems just during that time mushes acted.</p>

                <p>Allright! Time to send second part of my story... Have You been waiting? Hmm? Hmm? HMM? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I hope You were! So here it goes!!!</p><p>In my previous story I ended on describing my convertion rampage plan, and how we had ideal situation to do that, but could not really as Frieda was unable to participate because of real life... And that I decided to postpone our convertion rampage by 1 day <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Now... Now You will learn what big diffrence that one day ment for all of us <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Mustering AP</strong><br>I woke up at morning and logged in - counted my all AP and used most of it to do some helpfull things for hummans, than I went offline and... And I haven't comed online till around C8. So I have no idea what was going on during that time. I knew only that I will have full AP and my mission to fufill...</p><p>And so I log on around begining of C8...</p><p><strong>Diffrence of one day...</strong><br>So what was diffrence? First of all all my "1 spore from start" targets were NOT in Alpha Dorm anymore, and I could not be sure of their status when it comes to amount of AP... That alone was very problematic - but not critically bad as still forcing humman team to just kill 6 crew members (including morale source and Tech capable people) would be greatly harmful and possibly game ending (morale). So I still wanted to go on with my plan... I contacted Frieda about it in Mush Channel and described her exacly how and why we are going to do that. And She liked that idea! She decided to support me from begining to the bitter end EVEN if something will go wrong. So in the end Frieda was GREAT Mush Partner for me! Attentive, active, loyal and nice! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Now we had few more hours before day change... Guess what we were doing in that time?</p><p><strong><em>WE WERE LISTENING TO MUSIC TOGETHER!!!</em></strong> We changed Mush Channel into Music Sharing Channel and I could not believe HOW simmilar our music tastes were <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> So damn simmilar <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> We spend together over 2 hours sharing music and disscusing diffrent things around...</p><p>Frieda also made one mistake that my mush partners (<em>cought, cought...</em> SPERBI!!! <em>cought, cought</em>) are usually making... She posted in wrong chat!!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Insted of in mush channel, She did posted in open disscusion <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Fortunatly there was no things that would straight proved Her to be Mush... But it all looked so strange and... Just odd! And there started immidietly disscusion about "Frieda is sheming behind our back!" that was set in friendly, humorus attitude... But still I was nearly sure as hell that they already suspect her for that... That made it certian for me - we must follow plan no matter how many things has changes as soon Frieda will be targetted and killed and same might happen to me in short time.</p><p>So... What else has changed during that one day? They developed MycoScanner! Actually I was sure they will... But I was also sure that taking care of starting spores will not have place right after finishng that research! And to be honest I had no idea that Ian took Mycologist skill... I was sure that they will have to research Spore Sucker in order to remove spores. As it was, only Raluca and Paola had still their starting spores. Everybody else (Eleesha and Stephen) had their spores removed by that time... And since they were NOT in dorm with me I could not know it... So now my plan of converting 4 hummans in matter of few minutes got seriously hindered... It would be still possible if We would go for Paola and Raluca and their would be lvl 11 and... Bla, bla, bla... Not important really - would not happened for sure as Paola could not be lvl 11 Mush as we all can now see <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway... Decision was made by Frieda and me that we go on with plan - as I felt pressed AND we both had no idea about spores being removed... And so we waited utnill it was just 5 minutes to day change... And... ACTION!!!</p><p><strong>5 minutes of hard work!!!</strong><br>At 5 minutes to daychange both Frieda and I - we moved into Medlab (where Eleesha was together with Ian to be protected by His pacifism). Both, I and Frieda spiked Him once, which made MycoAlarms ringing in room. At that point I haven't noticed that She didn't had spores, nor that She wasn't turned into Mush yet... I was too concentrated on following plan... Time pressure was big factor here. If not that I would surely spend more time looking over details and would noticed that. But I didn't, nor Frieda did. Than both I and Frieda moved into ADorm. I spiked once Janice (after removing camera) and kicking off from beds everybody but Stephen. Than I spiked Janice and... TRANSFER!!!</p><p>Succes! Janice had plenty of AP! At lest that one thing went good. I extracted two spores openly in front of everybody and double spiked Stephen...</p><p>Now... Look at this - in according to plan both Eleesha and Stephen would HAVE to be Mushes by now and we would have still 4 spores to convert Raluca and... And I knew Eleesha is lvl 14 so Mycelium Spirit would be granted... So 5 spores - 2 for Raluca and 3 for Kuan Ti... But as it was, both - Stephen and Eleesha were still happy hummans... That was first moment when I realized that something went VERY bad... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> I took bed and...</p><p>And here comes in Frieda into ADorm and kick me off bed! Hahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> She didn't noticed that I transferred and wanted to kick off from beds all hummans apart of Stephen. Oh well... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Hahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Daychange - we are too deep into it to go back now!!!</strong><br>Frieda and I quickly decided that we have no way back right now from what we did. And that is truth actually - no way back now. I took out another two spores and spiked once Stephen and once Kuan Ti. Stephen got converted into Mush, and Kuan Ti was supposed to be transfered into (I quickly created secondary plan that could work actually - even though it could not hold a candle to first plan). Frieda in that time went to convert completly Eleesha. After that? Well... After that I declared Case Fire in Alpha Dorm. All mushes apart of Eleesha were right now protected and had beds. I did hoped that Eleesha will soon come in active, as it was Her time of activty... But She didn't. Insted She was killed rather quickly before managed to do anything. Now that I think about it... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> That is so funny thing to happen to Sperbi! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I had tons of laught from that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> It still makes me laught <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Hahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Ehmm... Sorry for that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> No! Seriously! That is VERY sad... VERY <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Hahaha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <em>Eleesha died! Hahahahahaha</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Ok! ok! I am serious now. I prommise <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I prommise <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Yea... Good... Actually Eleesha's death was sad for me as I did hoped to get Her help... It was funny only after one day or something like that. But not when it happened or immidietly after.</p><p>So what was my plan now? Simple and primitive as hell! Stephen apprentice my Diplomat and we get another 3 cycles of Case Fire. Than we go out and kill as many techs as we will manage, transfering itno them and generally making sure hummans will loose ability to repair PILGRED quickly (we knew Morale was an issue and will become bigger issue after they will have to kill us all - killing Mr. Cat was also part of plan in case of getting our hands on hidden blasters).</p><p>Cool plan, right? I mean... 6 cycles with beds ment 12AP for each of us, and there were 3 of us still alive... We still could do great damage, right?</p><p>No. We could not. Why? Oh! Irony! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> When we did carefull counting we found out that NONE OF US could be online when Case Fire would end actually... NONE of us! So we would get tons of AP that would not got used at all... How does THAT sounds? &gt;.&lt;</p><p>So plan <em>A</em> and plan <em>B</em> were out of the window... What was left was phatetic plan <em>C</em>. Which was - maybe Stephen will manage to apprentice Wrestler from Derek at some point and we will manage to kill as much Techs as possible... Anyway we try our best right after Case Fire will end... We still got together 18 AP during that time and we had some left from before... Chun with armor should not be a problem in that case, right? Ian would of course, but hummans had to guard two Dorm Exits and Ian could not be at both so it was obvious that at one there will be Ian and at other Chun with armor and kinfe and all weapons She migh have there...</p><p><strong>After Case Fire...</strong><br>So... Our plan was simple - try to get through Chun guarding RC and than aim to kill/transfer into as many techs as possible... Than target pilots... And if possible to try and kill Mr. Cat. And here we go into RC to kill Chun! Hurrra! Banzai! &gt;.&lt; <em>Stephen died</em> without making any serious damage to Chun... After first punch He got from knife... Seems like was critically hitted... Frieda and I used all our AP to get Chun down to only 4HP. After that Frieda transfered into Raluca who still had her starting spore, and managed to dismantle shower in Bravo Dorm... As for me... I was out of AP and could not do anything much, only go back to dorm or stay in RC. And it was time to go to work... So what I did? I congratulated humman team for their win and logged off...</p><p>Tommorow I will tell You next part of story <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Haha <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Tommorow! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>That rear corridor fight could not have gone any better for the humans.<br>I saw Stephen enter the corridor and started punching him and noticed he wasn't really doing anything to fight back. If he'd been able to act then this whole thing would have gone so differently.</p><p>A lot of things could have gone very differently it seems. I figured that spore in me wasn't such a big deal when I scanned myself so I just went back to the nexus because I didn't know when Ian would be available again. <br>I had already spent all my ap when Frieda transferred into me during the fight. But as Frieda I was left with 1 health and bleeding. I went into the dorm and contacted Chun about the switch. We had prepared a secret question for her to ask me should my identity ever be questioned so that was simple enough. Now I also had enough ap to kill off my old self, eat and get healed. So it wasn't so bad in the end.<br>I was very worried about the state of Pilgred now that I wasn't Raluca anymore. But Chun assured me that things were under control.<br>It had been a stressful couple of cycles with the tension building up to the inevitable fight, so I was glad to just lay down and rest for a while and trust that Chun knew what she was doing.</p><p>I wonder how everything would have went if the first mush plan had succeeded.. <br>It would have been whole lot of mush running around, thats for sure!</p>

                <p>And here's a piece from my point of view which may shed some light to this:<br>Those 5 minutes before day change? I had JUST been given a mage book of piloting (because first game, no piloting skills) and was told I could now do piloting jobs! YAY! I get to be useful!<br>So I went to Alpha dorm to hopefully find a bed to get AP for piloting jobs, but no, all beds are taken.<br>Oh well, might as well wait here and hope a bed opens up... and it did! Andie left! FREE BED! MINE!!<br>And then I thought.... why did she leave literally minutes before cycle change?<br>Why did she now come back... and DISMANTLE THE CAMERA!?!?</p><p>I immediately went to my jin-su mentor chat and told him. Then I saw janice create a spore! I told him that, except I also ran away because I was terrified of being turned mush! (Because I was now sure both andie and janice would turn the whole room mush)</p><p>Only later would I put the day-time together with their plan and realise that they were timing their attack to maximise the amount of spores they would have.</p><p>Because of my sleep schedule, I would be missing most of the fighting, cease fire actions and so on, as I had finals this day at uni! But I managed to squeeze in a little bit of fighting stephen, throwing all my ap on throwing punches in the corridor fight, landing some hits and then needing to retreat and log out.</p><p>And that was basically all of my involvement in the mush event. A random decision to wait for a bed in the dorm ended up with their attack being caught early <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">.</p>

                <p>Welcome, Mr.G! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Ahhh, very interesting stories to read! So many what if- could happen... now I am wondering how lucky we were it did not <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I must say as non-pilot Commander I had not much to do that time so I was only relaying research and keeping my eyes open. In fact, I even haven't realized that day change is coming and only chatting friendly with Roland about Piloting and stuff. Then, he suddenly screams: Andie is moving! I have checked the timer, refreshed page, saw 3 dots in Medlab and 4th in the turret immediately knew something bad is going to happen. Ian was yelling at me - as we still had opened chat with Chun for the relaying coordination and he knew I am online - someone please go kick Eleesha, she is in full health and just got spored twice, Frieda and Andie are Mush, I can heal her before it's too late... Then Roland: Janice just removed the camera and extracted the spore! Whoa... so much adrenaline in less than 5 minutes, I keep refreshing and trying absorb all the information fast and decide what to do. Lucky, our lady Chun was online as well - but before she could even react, I bet she was reading and analyzing all the same time... then, suddenly, we have 4 Mushes. Crap! Too late to switch with Ian in Medlab to kick poor Huntress to save her and change back. Plus, lady Chun correctly pointed out that it could be Ian who is Mush even while he was saying he ran to scan and got no spore.<br>We had to decide fast as Eleesha could wake up anytime and join the dark side and all in Alpha dorm were in life danger. Really great I had my fast running spy Roland out there! And even it took some time to find out from logs what really happened, it was very handy we knew something IS happening there.</p>

                <p>Hehe <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Time to finnal part of my story... WAIT?! WHAT? Finnal part of my story? How come that it is finnal part if Ship lasted 20 days and I just described like 3/4 of them? Well... That is because without mushes rest of that time was not that absorbing. And after we got all starmap fragments and calculated rout to Eden it became totally uninteresting for me. So I will not spare any time describing that, and will only describe "lightly" our hunt for starmaps...</p><p>But first things first... Where did I finished? Ah! Right... That my third plan failed and I had to go work, so ended up staying without any AP in Front Corridor, right? Ok... So let's go with story!</p><p><strong>Precious Cargo...</strong><br>When I was at work I had no idea what was going on on Daedalus. I assumed that I will be killed and ship will soon return Sol - even though we managed to get rid of 3 techs on board (Eleesha COULD become Tech, Stephen COULD apprentice Tech and Raluca WAS Phys/Tech), there were still three Techs on board, and active - Terrence COULD become Tech, Hua WAS Tech and Kuan Ti WAS Tech. So it was obviously obvious for me that Ship will get to Sol unless armageddon will come suddenly. SURPRISE!!! When I camed back from work and checked on Mush I saw that I was hold in one of Rear Storages with Chun guarding RC and Ian ER... Rest of the crew was working in great speed on RFS. Honestly there was not much I could done by myself at that situation so I just decided to stay untill I will accumulate big amount of AP and than I would try to kill Chun again after mutating... I also hoped that maybe a steel plate will help me, or at least room shake. I knew that crew will assume I will try to get spores and infect maybe somebody... But that would take me too long time, and even without Polyvalent Andie they would manage to finish RFS till than. Did I mentioned that Ian could just cure spores? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> So I decided to stay nicely and calmly in storage untill opportunity will arise. In the mean time I was RPing as much as possible, both as Janice and as NERON <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> That was really funny I think <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Around one cycle later Hummans finished their work on RFS and... And when I saw that I mutated and went into RC to do as much damage to whoever was there guarding me, as possible. It was Jin Su... I managed to hit Him once and... And after that I was no longer a Mush... To be honest mutating made me less likely to do any real damage as I had only 4AP before mutation... But Hummans didn't needed to know that mutated Mush can be also RFSed so I choose to go that way with it. Well... Some of them didn't knew that, but few did knew...</p><p>I was quickly asked if there are any more mushes on board... I privatly informed Chun that there are no more mushes and decided to go first through all messages in Mush Hunt channel <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Reason for that was simple - I know they were affraid that there are still mushes among them and I wanted to slightly delay info that they are Mush Free <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I informed Chun instantly to make sure that nobody will get hurt in case of panick etc. After I went through all messages I informed officially everybody that ship is free from mushes. From now on we concentrated on looking for maps...</p><p><strong>Hunting for Starmaps Fragments and Mush Traps...</strong><br>It was very unlucky to be honest... We visited like 5 planets with Crystalite and all of them in row proved to be Mush Traps. One after another - Trap, Trap, Trap, Trap, TRAP!!! Than Andie (previously Janice) managed to get Starmap Fragment from Ship Wreck I think... Or from IL zone? I have no idea... Does not matter really - we found Starmap Fragment from not Crystal Zone. Than there was like nothing for long time... We were finding good planets, but no Crystal Zones at all... And a tradegy camed - at one of explorations we lost Hua... She was very helpfull and was doing a lot for whole ship even though was logging in only once or twice per day. As long as Hua was still with us I don't remember us having hunters for longer than 1 or 2 cycles. Roland + Hua + Derek were just too effective combo for hunters to stand any chances... Moreover Hua was both - Technican and Pilot (and Bothanist and Survivalist). It was big loss... Died in MIA event. Thanksfully that didn't broke anybody's will to carry on. And so we explored more and more planets... Frieda (previous Ralulu) and TuttiKuanTi - both of them scanned planets like mad, to the point that expo teams had trouble keeping up with them...</p><p>Yea... We could not keep up with KT and Frieda's planets... That is because both - Andie (Poly) and Janice (Diplomat) were online only during C7. I was usually online few minutes earlier than Andie was, but that didn't changed fact that we could not explore planets on C4, C5 or C6. No. C7, C8 and C1 sometimes - that were our only options. And so we did - one or two planets per day... That was our bottleneck...</p><p>AND LUCK!!! There was good planet for solo expo for diplomat just before I went to work. So what I did? I informed everybody that I will take it and will be online only at C7 (it was C4 when I did it). Expo went greatly - I managed to grab Starmap Fragment (breaking chain of 5 Mush Traps) and was also keept alive by Chun and Ian who gave me heals and were checking on my status while I was idle in IB <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Than things went smoothly - our astro team managed to find another good for Solo planet with Crystal Zone and Andie returned with third starmap fragment...</p><p>And same cycle we finished Super Calculator and Kuan Ti managed to calculate route to Eden <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>What happened than? Than crew wanted to stay till D20 and go Eden after that.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico"><strong>THE END</strong><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/cat.png" alt=":mush_cat:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I was really worried when they shoved mushy Janice in the storage for safe keeping. I thought that there was no way the serum could be made in just 4 cycles. The amount of coordination going on there was crazy.</p><p>Before Hua died I hadn't really taken MIA zones very seriously. I figured the chances of getting lost was so low and ending up dead was even lower, so it didn't matter too much. After that though I didn't want to send anyone to a planet with too many forests again. Everything had been perfect up until that point, so it was sad to lose someone.<br>Really glad we didn't lose anyone else and made it to Eden safely.</p><p>Its gonna be a long time before I'm ready for another journey this long. <br>It was fun but it really wears you down.</p>
