Cristalite zone brings some spores (typical!), everyone openly screams Sol in the main channel, and then there is that alien zone which gets us an artifact. A very precious one. I bet those aliens just steal the<strong> Starmap fragments </strong>and hide them from Mush. To give them out to virtuous people like Rinaldos and their crew.</p><p>And a jumpkin to celebrate. Wow.</p><p>We managed to jump right before running out of oxygen, leaking from both of our tanks. After all those dramatic expeditions, it was really rewarding.</p><p>Now we are far away from all the "space cows" and "tax collectors". We shall remember our late comrades - Janice, whose shrink certificate was clearly handwritten, passionate Jin Su, kind and loving Ian Soulton (I wish you saw that glorious jumpkin we got!)</p><p>I was happy with the activity level of this ship. And everyone tried to roleplay, even those with lower activity level, that really created the atmosphere. We had a new player who really embraced his character. Roland, keep it up! Like a hwak, which is like hawk but different :-)</p><p>I was your Andie, a naive young ...man, who knew no difference between real life and imagined stories. Went for a book-grade cool adventure, discovered irl it was all different.<br>Was a pleasure to serve under the Rinaldos. Gioele was one hardworking man, especially when you expect a billionaire to be spoiled. But this guy did not forget his young dreams and was so inspired and inspiring. <em>Or maybe it's just coffee.</em> As for Paola, don't even get me started on how she is a miracle of universe. I just was in love with her, which somehow came out from our initial catfights, she clearly despised a federal underdog.... But the journey proved her I am a MAN...indeed...</p><p>The space cows and tax collectors were the explanations Janice and Gioele gave to me about those hunters, trying to keep me under the belief that Federation is alive and well.</p><p>I wrote a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.nrj-reloaded.fr/journal/v/511">diary</a> (day 0 is glitched, ignore it), but it gradually went concentrated on my personal line rather than on ship events. But there are some long expeditional logs, in case you dig this kind of stuff, and the first half contains a bunch of our dialogues. Day 13 is entirely about Paola (and D7 is when my afffection started), with a Chun bit... Our Chun was lethargic by nature, not by a skill, and I made sure to get in touch with her via private. So, In case you wondered what kind of person our Chun was: a bloodthirsty one, and also a seducor, but I was faithful to my love.</p><p>Chat logs:<br><a href="http://imgur.com/a/Qn8CN" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/Qn8CN</a> - expedition#4<br><a href="http://imgur.com/1rhGXD5" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/1rhGXD5</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/56L6uzP" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/56L6uzP</a> - example of what our Janice did<br><a href="http://imgur.com/a/Dus6Q" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/Dus6Q</a> - random Roland<br><a href="http://imgur.com/a/BPnZ0" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/BPnZ0</a> - some early bits of dialogue with newly assigned commander Gioele</p><p>Now, I really wanna meet you all here and see who were those dedicated people I played with.</p>

                <p>Hey hey Jin, old friend, and Ms. Crazy Kent! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>Mr. Rinaldo the coffee addict here <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/gioele.png" alt=":mush_gioele_50:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Andie!</strong> My good faithful officer - perfect job with the written story, I read your diary. So enjoyable, even only from your point of view. It gave me a good laugh reading you were trying to impress first Mr. Hogan and then my sweet daughter!</p><p>Sorry I am revealing myself a little bit late after ship's end, I was busy during weekend. (Hopefully others will appear and say hello as well!) Our ship was just great. Random jump for me and my first try of grumbling coffee man - I was not expecting much and it was such a pleasure to find RPers on board!</p><p>EVERYONE except brain-dead Ms. Williams was active and playing. That is so rare to see lately. Well- everyone... our lazy mushroom Stephen just collected energy to kill two very important people - THAT knife and blaster sitting in Bravo dorm - I wish I knew, but never been there till my mad attack to slay that monster. Our second alpha, Hua, was quite effective before the selection and then just stopped playing. Gold player with active partner, hmhmhh - real shame. Maybe discouraged by speedy research, who knows - strange she only gave up. Before we found out that she is not starving and decide to kill her - while Eleesha was sold to aliens for the fancy pink shower - it was hard to believe that last sleepy person will be our second Mush (that paranoia!). Roland did not make the decision easy, Chun was quiet and in fact, we did not have any publicly confirmed Human to trust. I was pretty nervous when our oxygen was too low after first expedition with broken pump. Refreshing page often while I was able to, checking if the oxygen level is still the same...</p><p>I did not want to be a Commander of ship (I haven't realized that Gioele is no.2 in the row while jumping), I wanted something universal to help where it will be needed to (caffeine junkie) or scan planters in case we need an extra Astrophysicist. Mainly thanks to you, Andie, and our RP I have managed to play the role of "leading civilian". Our charming Raluca was a jewel as well - she did not talk much but it always made me smile! Roland was funny - man, if this was your 3rd game... and so lucky with the planets (found oxygen planet when we were ready to risk one with seismic activity, found our first cristalite which gaves us also first starmap piece). My sweetheart Paola was a real daddy's girl, it was a pleasure to have her around! Old lady Bergmann, Mr. Wheels, Sergeant Hogan and my friend Lai were very effective in their duties, cold blooded in dangerous situations ready to solve anything. Lady Chun was shy silent person, but when it comes to kill the Mush or heal a fellow comrade, she never missed it! And our poor Professor, left behind during a dangerous mission in the snow... I feel very sorry for him he could not make it with us to Eden.</p><p>I fully agree, the atmosphere was really cool! No matter if you were there twice a day or twice per hour, everyone was involved in our journey and noone will be forgotten. Thanks all, it was great game, I really enjoyed it! My second Eden and very valuable <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>PS: <em>(whispers)</em> I still believe it WERE "tax collectors". I still have not received my account status from bank of Sol and THAT is very suspicious!</p>
