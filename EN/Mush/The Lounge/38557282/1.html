                <p>Coffee drama, that got a little silly near the end. Sadly yes most of the crew were quiet besides a few of us, but it was a really good ship and we did quite well to get where we did! I was Andie on that ship and we would have died a lot earlier if the update didn't bug out and the mush were able to sell one of the crew and finish PILGRED, but again, good job all! <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/cool.gif" alt=":anim_cool:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p><strong>His last message was:</strong></p><p>And of course you had no idea who I was, right? That was the most unluckiest game ever <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Terrence, you've got to tell them my story.</p><p>I was Jin Su.<br>Day 1 Cycle 8: Knowing that you were all very experienced crew, I knew we won't last too long. Me and Stephen checked inventory. We had access to 2 blasters, armor and 2 grenades (non of them were secured). We had a plan to destroy the ship by wasting all your fuel, killing Technicians and depriving you from oxygen. But then Roland and Gioele detested mush tests, so we chosed it would be the right thing to do - not to rampage and play tricky. I wanted a clean victory - no one dies, everyone go to Sol.</p><p>Day 4 Cycle 3: Second plan fails. Once I've seen we can get Pilgred from traders, I knew it was a golden opportunity. It is so stupid thought: all you need to do is to be comms officer, conduct a deal using grand inactive, and transfer to commander, then go to Eden. I thought THAT was dumb. Well I didn't know what was coming. When Stephen transferred and tried to conduct the deal following my instructions, he did EXACTLY as it was stated in the description. If we only knew that Twinoid just failed to deliver an unbugged release once again! Traiding doesn't work this way! A person (any person) must be in the storage in order to appear on the trade screen. So they literally ruined our play.</p><p>I feel horrible for what happened afterwards. Eleesha was online when Stephen transferred. She got with me on a separate channel and asked if she can go public about this. I knew we had a few minutes before everyone knows, so I dived into the radio screen in search of solution. Then, I remembered that items appeared on the trading list once they were in the storage. I knew what I had to do. I asked Eleesha to check the storage, "since we needed to secure grenades". Rings the bell? She couldn't, she was mobile. Then you came along. I knew it was pointless to lie as Eleesha was ready to report Stephen any second. So I put my bet on you... Sorry about this. I really had no other idea at the moment how to save Stephen! I needed that trade! Unfortunately (or fortunately, I couldn't forgive myself to sell you) you headed straight to kill him, claiming that grenades were secured. Then I rushed to Chun, as I knew she had the Hacker Kit in order to transfer to her, bring the kit to Eleesha and sacrifice myself in the storage, just to get to Sol now. But then I remembered I actually can't transfer to Chun <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"> Then you killed him...</p><p>I don't know how I survived the suspicion. I was into this plan to the end. Somehow I was still your commander, and still in the trusted circle. I swore to avenge Stephen. I swore you would never get to Sol. And I would never let you pour the serum on me. But again... I was wrong <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":'(" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>Very unlucky expedition. How did I died?''</p>

                <p>I'm still pretty miffed that he said all that before the ship was over, but I can see why he was frustrated.

                <p>Roland here.</p><p>I'm surprised the ship did so well given that several crew members lacked in activity or communication (or both). We were generally fairly lucky: We found the needed star maps, we didn't get any enormous hunter waves, our semi-actives were not killed by the ship, and we got rid of the mush (who should have won) even though our investigation was terrible (and only lead to killing the human Derek).</p><p>We had good skills: A diplomat, a green thumb, 3 astrophysicists, 2 technicians, 4 pilots (after level 5 Jin and magebook pilot Stephen had died). <br>We didn't initially have any research skills, but was lucky to get a medic book and a jelly. <br>Around day 15 Terrence gifted me gold to take firefighter - which turned out to be a great idea and saved me a lot more AP than shooter did.</p><p>It's quite telling that the caffeine junkie Gioele didn't get the "Once your appetite goes...". He did fairly well when he was online, but that was too rarely (often only cycle 8 ). You should be aware that you can end up in command when you pick Gioele, especially with no Chao.</p><p>Ian, on the other hand, seemed never to be online in cycle 8 - I don't get why you choose Ian if your time zone means that you sleep in cycle 8. Also didn't communicate enough (except perhaps in the Russian chat).</p><p>Hua went inactive during the trip, didn't communicate much and when she did, I often would have preferred that she had stayed silent. She threw a fit about Terrence drinking "her" coffee and somehow decided that she wouldn't participate in expeditions because of it.</p><p>Frieda did her scanning job fairly well, but didn't talk enough.<br>Chun did her research job fairly well, but didn't talk enough.</p><p>Andie, KT, and Janice were good. Solid players who helped make the ship run well.</p><p>Terrence, you were great. Hyperactive, knowledgeable, and organized. A bit too glory hungry perhaps, but you probably don't regret that as the ship was succesful and you ended up with the no. 1 spot on the ranking.</p>

And I also have 5 level, so it was very nice that you had the same skills and gold mode as well. You were great and reliable, so I added you too.</p><p>I hope you remember how we managed to repair Pilgred from 0% to 100% in a cycle without anyone's intervention, and the same was done with Plasma Shield.

                <p>Hey there Janice here and I just want to thank everyone on this ship once again for how well we did I'am a little confused as to how on earth Hua thought that using the coffee counted as griefing but oh well thats life and as for the baby name honestly I have no idea I have always been terrible at naming things <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">. Sad what happened to jin su but well it happens and I agree that him deleting his account over it is a massive over reaction. Roland as for us getting lucky I won't deny it cause well we really did get quite lucky however I think it would be a mistake to discount the people on this ships knowledge and effort including yourself of course cause I have seen ships get just as or even more lucky then ourselves and fail horribly not to mention pretty much all of getting to eden is getting lucky enough to find the star map pieces before everything explodes <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico">. Hope to see most of you on another ship sometime farewell.</p>
