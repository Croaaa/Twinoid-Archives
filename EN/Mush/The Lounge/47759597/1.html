Stephen confessed this was his second ship and first time as Mush. He had spiked Frieda, no idea where but at least this was not noticed by the humans.</p><p>As a pilot (the only one at the time), I head out to collect scrap, only one collection so I had some ap left over.There is an astropad link and I look at it to discover the mush sample is on the shelf in bravo dorm updated by Janice. Janice has left the dorm and I thought this would make a good cover for defacer. Unfortunately, I was one ap short of everything I wanted to do, which was to double spike Gioele that cycle plus shower. I picked up both the sample and the soap. So, Gioele just got the one spore then. <br>I head out for lunch and return after cycle change to see a few people had been in bravo dorm but had not mentioned the defacer.</p><p><cite> ATTENTION COMRADES Bravo dorm is not a party area for mush sake... Stay out and don't enter unless you report dirtiness. There are 2 mush as long as the human crew refrains from passing by too much I can narrow down suspects. Please do your part for the humans and avoid Bravo dorm to clear your innocence.</cite></p><p>Eleesha had written that, but hadn't visited Bravo Dorm. She didn't realise that there had already been a party in Bravo Dorm! I decided to inform her.</p><p>Roland (sprinter) grabbed a knife, also ate the jumpkin the first plant produced even though there was a pot waiting for it. At some point, I notice he has pilot - perhaps starter magebook?</p><p>I awaited day change and defaced Bravo Dorm again, this time to complete Gioele's conversion. I decide to also hide the mush sample in the dorm. I think Eleesha would have noticed an additional mush shown in the crew bar. However, Gioele logged in later that cycle and took anonymush.</p><p>I stay in bed for a few cycles, hunters appeared again. Janice finds the mush sample and heads to the lab but it isn't dropped for research. Anabolics gets completed. In D3C6, Roland is slain by Eleesha and Terrence, and also Gioele. Gioele didn't log in after his conversion. A plan could have been he spiked and transferred into Raluca, and we rush pilgred (I am gold, but had only chosen pilot and botanist) but as he was no more, I had to think of plan b.</p><p>By C7 (although I was busy playing rockfaller at the end of c6 and had a full bar of ap), I thought I'd better take down some hunters. Emptied my bar. Eleesha kills Stephen. 2 mush dead. I knew I didn't have much time to live as Eleesha suspected me, so I was thinking of plan B.</p><p>Frieda had found a nice planet, no oxygen. Terrence had already loaded a fuel to escape hunters. I could have loaded the other two fuel for the planet but didn't. Jin Su moved the ship so we lost that planet. Plan B could have been to transfer in Icarus bay..</p><p>Fertile means on D4 (if alive), I can extract for free. I would have 4ap - I'd use 2 of them to extract another spore, and use the other 2 with Infector. I intended to transfer. Two dots on the bridge, one I knew was Chao who was a tutorial player. The other, I hoped to be Paola.</p><p>C8, I treat the banana in the lab (only one plant - there had been a fire). Still, 4mp at D4C1 would mean I had enough to carry out my plan. Eleesha gets up, goes somewhere and comes back to Bravo Dorm but doesn't take a bed.. I was expecting to be sliced to pieces so I died in ZombVival..</p><p>D4C1 arrives. Still alive! So, into action I go. I drop my trakie (was in conversation with Eleesha) Take tech skill and remove BD camera, head to bridge extracting my two spores. I remove bridge camera too with my remaining tech point. Discover it is actually Jin Su on the bridge instead of Paola. Oh well. Infect Jin Su and Chao. Transfer into Chao - he had not finished the tutorial! He was at 4 morale. I extract two more times and convert Jin Su. I wondered if there was a blaster still in storage. Nope. Terrence notices Hua took down the camera. He heads to the bridge and kills my old body (was at 6 health after two showers and a roomshake). I bumped into Eleesha and thwacked her 4 times with wrestler. I head to Raluca's turret. Roland had also been in there using the turret! I forgot to pick crazy eyes. Terrence comes to see us in the turret, heads out for food, and comes to slice me giving me a head trauma. I die from sepsis the following cycle.</p><p>Ship was at low hull and with 7 hunters outside. Inevitable boom came a couple of cycles after my death.</p><p>Mixture of new players, even with gold, and inactives/tutorials. The lack of research meant I had a free reign. Kudos to Terrence and Eleesha. Frieda did OK too, and even Jin Su. Good luck on your next ships!</p>

                <p><strong>Terrence here.</strong></p><p>Eleesha noticed more than you think. We were all ready to lob a grenade in BD and take you all out but Janice refused to disable corepeace for some reason, even after Eleesha told her it was full all three of the mush. We thought Roland was mush too because he was more mushy than the others.</p><p><strong>Janice:</strong><br>Finding the mush sample and <em>leaving it there</em> and still updating Astropad was not a fatal failure, but still was a preventable failure that greatly contributed to our loss. <br>The second major mistake that almost certainly could have prevented our loss was when you refused to disable corepeace. There is no reason not to disable core peace a day and some cycles after mush selection. 'MURICA and his copycats would have already rampaged and done their shenanigans most likely. At the very least, you could have asked me. It's unlikely to have two trolls talk to each other to collaborate their shenanigans.<br>When we called you semi-active in the game chat, you <em>were</em>. It's not an insult, and it's not about timezone. No offense was meant by that, it was just an observation useful for emergency planning for what we can/can't reasonably expect to accomplish.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong><br>Based on your comments in The End, you think I was a troll. In truth, you were justifyably killed because of your mistakes that made you look so mushy:<br>1. <strong>You ate the first jumpkin when there was an empty pot to plant it in.</strong> You then claimed that your Junkbumpkinitis proved your humanity. This actually backfired because you <em>can</em> fake this one illness with the Bumpkinoid Flair from the vending machine. Because of Hua's play, we knew the dorm was full of at least three mush, and this just made it look like you were number four offering a fake humanity proof.<br>2. You picked up and carried the knife with you for no good reason. Very mushy as well.<br>3. You went out of your way to RBT where Ralucca was to shoot hunters with a turret.<br>4. As a bronze newbie Roland, you didn't ask for help or direction. As just a sprinter, you should have been trying to coordinate with the crew on what needed moving where. We had hydropots all over the place, samples needing transport to the lab, etc. And you did none of this and instead used your AP to do all these mushy things.<br>Any 2 (maybe even just the jumpkin) of these thing earned you a death sentence. The fact that you were holding the knife meant that even though we had ample suspicion you were mush, we had to kill you even though you could (and did) turn out human - just to get the knife to kill the rest of the mush.</p><p><strong>Hua:</strong><br>I could argue that 'you won because of Roland and the other humans' stupid mistakes but that's not really fair. Mush victories are about taking those inevitable mistakes (I made a few of my own) and capitalizing on them. Which you did very well. Congratulations, Hua, and well played. I was impressed.</p><p><strong>Eleesha:</strong><br>Excellent sleuthing. We both made mistakes, but thanks for working with me as a team. Glad I could prove my humanity there at the end. A pleasure to play with you.</p><p><em>Overall, 10/10 would get my teeth kicked in again by Hua.</em></p>

                <p>Like I said I don't think deserved an AP thread. Sprinter Roland combined with inactives combined with new players is not good times. HUA I am a bit perturbed as <em>you sort of played against your team..</em></p><p>You were the one that told me about the defacing. D2c5. I noted it. D3c1 I saw 3 mush appear and no one moved during that time. I walked in on a scrambled bravo dorm. I thought Roland and gioele had mushed you. After killing Sprinter Roland and the knife dropped. I was left with 3 mushes but there was a catch 22. I knew you were mush but with no hull and abysmal crew I decided not to kill you d3c8 I knew we were safe till d4 cause spores were used already. Then you mushed Jin and transferred to Chao. Failed killing me <em>thanks plastenite armor</em> and then you died to Terry.</p><p>Thanks for the help Terrence. At least someone knew what they were doing.. that grenade play would have worked but even if we killed hua. It would have been hard , not impossible. Without pilots.. I was banking on the pilot mage book. But then Roland rofl... oh man..</p>

As a lone pilot I could have staved off those hunters for long enough to rush PILGRED and return to sol for a technical win. Unfortunately, the mush team had their own plan for the Daedalus...</p>

You ate the first jumpkin when there was an empty pot to plant it in. You then claimed that your Junkbumpkinitis proved your humanity. This actually backfired because you can fake this one illness with the Bumpkinoid Flair from the vending machine. Because of Hua's play, we knew the dorm was full of at least three mush, and this just made it look like you were number four offering a fake humanity proof.</cite>Bumpkinoid flair looks very clearly different than Junkbumpkinitis if you can compare. While they both give you a Jumpkinhead, the flair also creates some animated flames/glowy crap coming from your head that you can't get rid of to make it look like Junkbumpkinitis. <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/pLCUE2i.png">Here</a>'s some <span class="tid_strike">creepy</span> Bumpkinoid for your reference</p>

                <p>Okay, so I made a mistake. The wiki is misleading. It doesn't say that bumpkinoid flair looks different, and indicates that it can defeat attempts to use it as a mush test.</p><p>I have updated the wiki to reflect this to prevent others from making this mistake. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>To be honest though, that was the least suspicious reason (the disease report - the eating of the jumpkin itself instead of planting it when the empty hydropot was <em>right there</em> was highly suspicious.)</p>

                <p>I suppose in theory one can hide if they have Junkbumpkinitis or not by using the flair. The flair with illness looks exactly the same as the flair without the illness. The flair sprite covers the illness sprite over completely. (kind of useless since people can check for illness with medkit however)<br>But with Junkbumpkinitis by itself, you can always tell <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
