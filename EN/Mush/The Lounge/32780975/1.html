                <p>Hey guys!</p><p>It finally ended, just as Stephen predicted <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It's been a good game, great experience for me and a lot of fun.</p><p>Let's recap. I think Kuan Ti was the first one we lost, very soon after start. Followed closely by Paola, his mushy killer. Then we lost Eleesha and Raluca due to inactivity. After that we pulled ourselves together and managed to do some good. We had lot of semi-actives, who were occupying lot of beds for the most of the time. Ian was very active at first, then he suddenly said he wasn't that experienced and that someone else should lead. After neglecting his duties with plants and usurping medlab bed, we should have known he was a mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> (I admit that I didn't pay that much attention at finding a second mush, we had more problems with ship and other stuff). After Ian, Terrence stepped up and started pointing people in right direction. Thanks for that Terrence, we wouldn't last this long without you! Others did their job as best they could and knew how. Except for Stephen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> who wandered the ship aimlessly, holding the title of communication officer and preventing us from contacting any rebel bases... We tried reaching him, but we couldn't get him on private channel, thinking he dropped his radio and didn't hear us. And then his famous and only words appeared in general chat: "We are going to die!". So he <em>did </em>have a radio and he <em>spoke </em>english. He just chose to ignore everything. At that point, I was between becoming apathetic sleeper (hoping to die soon so i could start over) and laughing and optimistically continuing to work with our limited resources. Well, you know what i chose. <br>One of best moments for me was our one and only expedition (Terrence proving a point that even people in wheelchair can hike, and fall of cliff, and hike again, and fall again... and still get back alive!). It was great because it required much coordination and i didn't really believe that we could do this, but we did. Good for team building. Shame that we didn't get the chance to do more of that.<br>In the end, poor activity and incommunication got to us. In a form of asteroid.</p><p>Thank you all for good game and fun times!<br>And special thanks to Roland for never letting my morale drop to critical <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Yours truly,<br>Janice, the vomiting shrink</p>

I figured we had quite a few new players so I tried my hand at giving guidance and organizing tasks despite my lack of experience [I was serious when I said I only played two ships prior] I was pretty much praying for some beta players so the ship doesn't go to hell right away. I got my wish of course; some awesome people like Terrance and Chun filled the remaining slots but as fate would have it, the game picked me to be the mush.<br><br>This was my first time as a mush so I did spend a few days failing at mushood and getting suspicious. My partner mutating before she could read my 'do not mutate' instructions in the chat did not help things. Neither did the improbable injuries. I think the ship was trying to convey a point to the team when it kept on smashing me with falling ceiling tiles on day 3. <br><br>I think <span class="tid_strike">we</span> you did quite well considering all the players you had that were just wandering about the ship. Special mention to Jin Su, our very own exclusive door-tester. An extra special mention to Stephan, who, when not flirting with all the ladies or broadcasting ominous messages over the radio, enjoys relaxing in the refectory with his daily ration and a solid MADcube session <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"><br><br>Yes, Stephan, we <em>did</em> really all die in the end.</cite></p>
