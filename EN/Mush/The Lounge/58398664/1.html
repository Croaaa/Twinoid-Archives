                <p><em>Events may not have fully resembled what appears. My memory is terrible and I have not kept detailed ship records like I once did.</em></p><br><p>The ship began as it ended, wonderfully active. Research was quickly a flurry of activity and had soon pounded out nearly everything it was entitled to before everyone was awake. By the time the last few stragglers popped free of Cryo a good chunk of Nexus upgrades had also been done.</p><p>Ian brought extra pots with him on the run up to our escape on the Daedalus and this coupled with soon-unlocked Oxygen ducts meant that O2 would scarcely ever be in an emergency state. We never would find anything better than bananas - all the fruits we found were horrible deathsacs that at best were identical in effect and at worst completely debilitating when eaten.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Despite a vast majority of the crew being active and communicative, a few stragglers tragically did not seem to survive the cryo sleep with all their marbles intact. After an initial hello, Frieda began to wander the ship at random and would not respond to any outreach. Attempts by Chao to intervene in a private channel resulted in Frieda simply dropping her walkie talkie. Sadly, it was soon decided she would be smothered and met her end on the bridge, having been holding the mysteriously-missing scooter all this time. Her humanity confirmed in death, so began the hunt.</p><p>Eleesha rang alarm bells in Jin Su's initial mush hunt channel almost immediately. After selection, she had gotten dirty running the coffee machine. She was pegged as prime suspect and an eye was kept on.</p><p>But she would not be next. No, as the second apparently brain-damaged crewmate turned out to be none other than the organizer of the expedition himself, Gioele. After a period of silence and no action, Mr. Rinaldo was gently let out an airlock and bid adieu. Another human was lost.</p><p>Eleesha's flurried reaction to the death of the inactive Gioele coupled with her strangely absent contribution to an otherwise bustling ship finally led to her dismissal. Chao's marching orders were given, and Eleesha was laid to waste. The first mush was rooted out while sleeping in her bed.</p><p>Confirming Ian had gotten ill from the sight of Eleesha dying turned out to be simple. The practical Chao simply near shot his arm off and then healed him. The confirmed team had grown to Jin Su, Finola, Raluca, Chao, Stephen and Terrence - if only because he had contributed to the death of Eleesha. The hunting teams blood was up, and the question over who the other alpha might be loomed heavily overhead.</p><p>It was decided Raluca would genius the serum in preperation for trying to cure the remaining mush before a rampage happened. The suspect list had dwindled quickly from various incidental confirmations. Hua, Roland, Janice, Paola and Kuan Ti were all unknown quantities.</p><p>Due to her frequent shiftwork in and out of bravo dorm and her invaluable status as diplomat for later potential expos, Janice was selected to be stabbed in the neck with a giant needle full of experimental chemicals. She did not appreciate this, but was quite understanding when she turned out to be human. With the chance of curing the last mush over, difficult decisions were weighed.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The most controversial next step was then made - the crew would kill KT. KT had not, like the others, been completely dispensable, but for a variety of reasons was pegged as suspect number one. Sorrowfully, when murdered he had turned out to be human and this tore a rift in the mush hunting team. With the upsetting loss of KT, it was urgent now more than ever that the last mush be found and dealt with.</p><p>In her effort to complete comms work while the pall of KT's death still hung over the ship, Paola had eaten twice in the lab, confirming herself as a hungry hungry hippo, er, human. The list shortened drastically to Roland and Hua. Despite having never been in bravo dorm, Roland's suspicious movements, predilection towards using turrets and otherwise wasteful AP usage fingered him as the most likely culprit.</p><p>The decision was made.</p><p>Janice was instructed to guard the corridors, and Jin Su took up alpha bay. Roland was slumbering, none the wiser, after a worrying period of inactivity. He would not have a chance to run to the Pasiphae. The precautions were rendered moot, however. Chao turned out to be quite excellent at shooting unarmed crewmates sleeping in bed. Roland was dropped from a single shot, and the ship was now presumably mush free.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The events afterwards were mostly typical of the luckiest, smoothest Eden run one can imagine. All the important projects and research were quickly rounded out, plants were secured and astro work went ahead swimmingly. An early cristalite map before even all the mush were dead buoyed everyones hope. And then the second.</p><p>As usual, the third piece proved relatively elusive. Aliens were spoken to, various items were stolen from kleptomaniac xenos, horrible fruits were picked and left to burn in icarus bay. Still, nobody gave up. Everyone showed what they were made of, and finally after a string of unproductive expeditions, with the ship beginning to fall apart, there it was - just like that. Paola had led everyone to the last piece of starmap, suspended in its cristalite cradle.</p><p>Ian decoded the way through a haze of plant-inspired inspiration, and Eden lay open. A quick round of celebrations were had, and everyone was off to their new home.</p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/no_mush_bar.png" alt=":mush_no_mush_bar_1:" class="tid_ico"></p>
