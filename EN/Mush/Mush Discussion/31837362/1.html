We thank everyone who sent in an application, and those who have passed and helped us.<br><br>To those who are not accepted at the current time, you may try again in due future! Have a nice voyage and keep your seat belts on at all times! <img src="http://mush.vg/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"><br><br>To apply you can navigate to <a target="_blank" href="http://twinoid.com/tid/groupDiscuss"></a><a href="http://twinoid.com/tid/groupDiscuss" target="_blank">http://twinoid.com/tid/groupDiscuss</a> and PM "EN Mush Mods"<br><br>What we require of you:<br>- English University Degree <span class="tid_wspoil">(No I'm just joking, but non-translated English is the minimal expectation)</span><br>- A great sense of Judgement, (But objectivity is very important)<br>- Some free amount of time to <strong>actively</strong> judge complaints.<br>- Motivation of why you want to become a Judge.<br>- Must not have a serious SDF penalty record. In addition must not have a serious Twinoid penalty record.<br>- Being active on the forums helps to tip the balance in doubt.<br><br>You may not:<br>- Disclose anything confidential the moment you enter the Judge Position. <span class="tid_wspoil">(P.S. That is actually everything. And with everything I meant <strong>EVERYTHING</strong>.)</span><br>- Disclose the identity of non-public Moderators and/or other Judges.<br>- Disclose penalty reasons and/or what said player have done wrong. That is a job for Mods.<br><br>Judge Privileges may be revoked at any time, for any reason or no reason stated. There are no rewards for being a Judge any other than helping this community nurture the English way <br><br>The SDF gets reports from players in ships, and those complaints will become visible for Judges to vote the moment the ship ends. Moderators can see reports at active ships ofcourse. Judges will vote based on evidence, and Moderators will finally punish/pardon based on previous evidence and Judge votes.<br><br>However, Judges are <strong>not</strong> Moderators. They will not see your name nor past history of SDF points. Nor can they act upon or see reports made at the forum.<br><br>I recommend those that are accepted to keep their Judge identity hidden unless they wish to reveal it themselves only.<br><br>The amount of available Judge Positions are limited. We may approach potential Judge recruits at our own discretion.<br>Judge Recruitment: "<strong>Closed</strong>" <br><br>If you have any questions about <strong>Judges/Moderators</strong>, please ask them through the method described above. There is another thread about the <strong><a target="_blank" href="#">SDF Rules, Explanations, Quarantaine!</a></strong>. I recommend those who would like to discuss the rules do it <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/tid/forum#!view/104909?p=2|thread/30437559">here</a><br></span></p>
