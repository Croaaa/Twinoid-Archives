Make an exception note in the rules that the Mush can NEVER reveal their teammates, even when converted back to a human.</cite><p>I suppose in the case of my current ship, we didn't have to deal with that controversy (for which I don't think there's a clear answer, yet.) One alpha mush was killed, and the other never had the opportunity to turn anyone. So to keep from being suspected and killed, he assisted (along with several of the crew) with the serum research. After it was done, he then revealed himself as mush, and asked to be made human again. We made the call to trust him, and the voyage has been surprisingly smooth since then.</p><p>Had there been more than one mush, it could be reasoned that by openly volunteering to be turned, he'd be playing against his team. On the other hand, if he was discovered by the human team, and told to take the serum or die, it might be reasoned that he wasn't given a viable choice but to accept it.</p><p>Switching teams in the latter fashion might compel him to reveal the other mush in that case, since they're not on his "team" any longer. But if he'd volunteered while other mush remained alive and active, it could be construed to be a traitorous action, couldn't it?</p><p>So perhaps the general rule should be that mush can't <em>volunteer</em> to become human again, <em>unless</em> they are the only mush left alive. That very easily can be defined as playing against their team. If they're caught by the humans, then it's revert to human or be killed...but I don't think they should be forced to name any other mush as a <em>precondition for being given the serum</em>. That would make them a traitor to both sides, and willingly so in the case of the latter.</p>

                <p>If you think about this from the point of view of the game universe, a mush would <em>never</em> volunteer to take the serum, no matter how many mush there are on board. The mush want the humans to die or be turned, end of story. Them becoming human again is the worst possible option from where they're sitting. However, once that mush is cured, the virus controlling their actions is gone. That now human is probably appalled at what they and their former fungus comrades have been doing, and shouldn't hesitate to give up any useful information they might have gained as a mush. Yes, this makes eliminating remaining mush easier once you cure one. However, identifying and curing a mush isn't exactly a cakewalk, since many conditions have to come together for making the cure and you only get one shot at using it on the correct person.</p>

                <p>That's sort of what I was getting at with my suggestion. They can't be compelled, much less allowed, to give up any other mush players <em>before</em> being given the serum. <em>After</em> they have it, their side's changed, and they can act as they see fit. Though, it's also fair to reason that a former mush player who doesn't give up that information can be thought of as playing against their own (human) team.</p><p>Though I can see Rain's point as well. Humans aren't allowed to surrender or commit suicide, so why should the mush, even if they aren't going to "die" in the process? Well, I suppose the only way to get a conversion back to human in that case...is to trick one of the mush into being in a room where the cure can be administered, and hope that the suspicions of being mush aren't wrong. It's used just like a medkit, so they can't resist it.</p>

                <p>IIn order to compell a reluctant Mush to always conceal their identity, there needs to be a strong incentive. Reward the Mush greatly for it. Just stating it in the rules and not making it fun, well, that's a broken mechanic. If it is currently rewarding (xp, perks, etc) cool. If not, people will break the rule more often than naught and either the game or the rules will need to be tweaked.</p>

However I do not think it's very fun to be last and still carry it on.</p><p>They should be able to 'volunteer' themselves like Spazticus said as the Last One standing.</p><p>About the "converted Mush" though. As others have said, it is terrible hard mostly to find the Mush. Ofcourse the chance gets bigger if there are more Mush, but generally it would be hard to hit the right one... With one chance. What if you get the wrong person? The serum would be a waste.</p><p>It is hard though what to do for the converted Mush. They can't say who isn't the Mush, since he knew it when he became a Mush. It is very controversial and opinion-based of the community as a whole...</p><p>I'd like to hear the stance of the SDF as well if the game is launched...</p>

Under internal rules, all players are obliged to work for their side. Ultimately, it comes down to intent. If a human intentionally helps Mush by concealing information he or she knows about that could help humans, that would be, in my opinion, a violation of the rules. The only situation I can think of right now where a mush turned human could legitimately hide that information is if there was a mush plan beforehand to convert the human back to mush. In that case, the human could hold onto to that information for a little bit of time, but the other humans would have the right to kill the converted human as a traitor or as an acting agent of mush should the human refuse to reveal the other mush.</p>

                <p>What Annette said, just make it so that the converted human from Mush doesn't earn any personal distinctions. I mean, he has to loose more from a conversion than from being killed as a Mush. This way no one would surrender as a Mush. Maybe also a distinction for being killed AFTER the ship has completed the project to convert you?</p><p>Well, he can always still win a few distinctions after he's converted from human or something like that.</p>

Like I said earlier NO evidence, and I mean none, zero.

                <p>To be fair, Anette, you'd edited your post to add that information while I was typing, so I didn't see the details. But I agree with you, there should be SOME evidence to prompt that action on his part. On a few of my previous ships, we agreed (in chat) that Chun and Chao could use their "information-gathering talents" without warning,so that potential mush players wouldn't be as likely or able to cover their tracks. Then it would be up to the rest of the crew to maintain their health and morale. But even if your Chao didn't have access to that skill, deciding on his own to just shoot someone without evidence is a bad call.</p>

But I agree with you, there should be SOME evidence to prompt that action on his part. On a few of my previous ships, we agreed (in chat) that Chun and Chao could use their "information-gathering talents" without warning,so that potential mush players wouldn't be as likely or able to cover their tracks. Then it would be up to the rest of the crew to maintain their health and morale. But even if your Chao didn't have access to that skill, deciding on his own to just shoot someone without evidence is a bad call.</cite><p>Thank you, Meadow! I"m sorry Spazticus, I thought I should explain it more but not double post. Your post was really helpful though. I appreciate the info, thanks for it.</p><p>So, here's what happened. The serum was fast tracked, the player cured our mush who was unaware. The killer decided that the curer went anonymous and the mush did, too. So, we someone had, in their mind, two mush anonymous. Even though they were never dirty and both now working for the team. The suspected mush who was killed also wanted more evidence to kill our first mush and this too, was the killer's other piece of evidence. Slim, if you ask me. Because, it's for the best to make absolutely sure using the tools available to 15 players. There's no way, day 1, this should be difficult to make absolutely sure.</p><p>So, two pieces of "evidence:</p><p>1) cured mush, alone, in a room<br>2) was seemingly reluctant to kill the first mush</p><p>That's it. To me, that's too little! But, might not be against the rules, of course. I'm glad it all went down now! It will give us all a better understanding of proper evidence and how the rules interpret them. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

Also lets say that they were politely communicating too.</p><p>What now? Can the other human crew kill Chun for this?<br>I would say no. She maybe no value to the humans but killing her would not help the human cause either (apart for saving a little oxygen) and so we would need to tolerate the player.</p><p>...but what about using the bed?<br>I think if a player is wasting their own AP thats fine but eating a ration or using a bed is wasting the crew's AP and it's starting to cross the line.</p><p>Lets add something else to the example, such as holding on to the apron, now the players motivation changes completely. If the Kube is the goal (<em>dumb as it maybe</em>) then the apron is irrelevant to that goal and the player is being malicious.

                <p>Ruling that a Mush can never intentionally reveal themselves (with the intention of being given the serum) will lead to mush players who have been alone for days and in a futile fight, just walking into the Lab, and sporing in view of the research team. They don't <em>have</em> to state their intentions in this case; it's blatantly obvious they're giving up, if they do this. And it still leads to the same possible results I outlined: Either the human crew is forced to kill them, or they give the mush player the serum.</p><p>I can almost guarantee this sort of "premeditated surrendering" will happen, unless every crew has a rule that they cannot complete the Mush serum until they confirm their Mush are dead...and I don't see <em>that</em> rule being put into place, either.</p><p>The reason I offered the potential way out for the last standing Mush player is fairly simple. They can "lose" as a Mush player, and still "win" as a human player. Their mush side still loses, in that case, but often when fighting alone, that will be the natural result anyway, unless the crew they are up against has a high rate of inactivity.</p><p>As for the second question, should a converted mush be compelled to out the other mush? I say they can choose not to, even for a short time, but they'll also be considered as working against their team.</p><p>That said, I still maintain my stance that a Mush player <strong>cannot</strong> out their fellow Mush, <em>as a <strong>precondition</strong> for being given the serum.</em> I think that goes far beyond fair play, and that is one of the main reasons I only suggested the "way out" for a Mush player who <strong>specifically</strong> has no Mush partners.</p>

The community comes up with them? I'm not interested in what the vague moral values "the community" has. I want to know how to play within the official rules. Unless the community is the one coming up with the official rules. If we play by the vague moral values of the majority, it's just another Die2nite where you can play within the rules but get shit on when you are do something <strong>within the official rules</strong> that someone doesn't agree with for whatever reason. No thanks. I'm just not sure how all this will be done though so it will be interesting to see.</p><p>To address whether it's okay to kill a suspected Mush with zero evidence, officially you can, right? I'm talking about when we are out of beta and we there will be sanctions. If someone is annoying, you can kill them, within the rules. You can kill someone you suspect as Mush on a hunch, it's not right of course to do that IMO because you end up hurting your ship but is it "playing against your team"?</p><p>As for Mush giving up doing mushy things in the lab where the serum is already finished, it's going to happen and if it's the last Mush on board, will it be reported? And, is it against their team? Technically it is but I don't feel it's reportable or rather, I don't think that direct surrender is provable because it's not a direct surrender. What about the newbie Mush who does that by accident? It could happen. You can't sanction that person! You can say "it's against the spirit of the game!" for sure.

                <p>I've changed my opinion.

                <p>I feel I should not be held to the norms and interpretations of others. We have our rules and they are short, vague, and open to interpretation. Now just because some Beta-testers got here first does not give us the right to translate these rules as we see fit. Each ship will be different and each cast will portray them different. People talk about our day15 serum/mush conversion and say it was wrong. So we say, what will stop people from blatantly making a spore in the lab? Again people say against the rules. So what's to stop people from doing something mushy ( get dirty a lot, move stuff around, do something in fishy in front of a camera) so they get caught? Point being, who are we to judge when a person has blatantly outed themselves as a mush in hopes of serum? Where is the line draw and who is going to judge?</p><p>I say we save the judgement for the habitual offenders and enjoy this game. Too many people get pissed off at others gameplay/style because it doesn't agree with their own. Reminds me of a Survivor, of course you get pissed if you get voted off just like you get pissed if you die in this game. But what happens when you die? <strong>You get the opportunity to play again, it's not the end of the world.</strong></p><p>So relax, save your gripes and play the game for it's intentions........enjoyment. <span class="tid_wspoil">Otherwise why would you pay for something that upsets you/makes you bitter?</span></p>

                <p>You know, I'm far too lazy to go through and cite all the things I want to point out... maybe when I'm a little more awake. But there are a few things that need to be said.</p><p><strong>This is not French Mush</strong> - Our community is different. Our time zones are different. A very large portion of us don't speak French, don't play the French version and not only don't know, but should NEVER be expected to be held to the French SDF rules. When there are "community" rules to be put into place, our version of SDF will do that and we'll figure things out.</p><p><strong>Different "rules" mean different things to different people</strong> - Specifically, killing an annoying person. It's kinda funny that this thread is all about "OMG AGAINST THE RULES I'M GONNA REPORT!" when Epoq mentioned in Facebook that annoying people can find themselves on the wrong side of a blaster when someone asked how to deal with people like that. While it wasn't a flat out statement advocating killing annoying people, it left a LOT of room for interpretation and roleplay. And you know what, that annoying person may just be playing against their team and need taking out. If they're sowing that much discord among the rest of the crew, kinda hampers the whole mush hunting effort.</p><p><strong>Roleplay is different for different people, different ships, different situations</strong> - Can we please not turn Mush into the next game where the community screams "if you don't play my way, you play wrong and should be reported"? It's freakin roleplaying. Let the person playing the role, you know, play the role. And what's more, let them play like they see fit.</p>

                <p>I've been watching this thread for some time (and the other similar threads) and I absolutely agree with this statement. I think this is the most logical response. Mush should never give in, should never surrender, they shouldn't convert and play nice till the serum is done if they're alone. They need to work and spore every chance they get, sneak in that spore while someone is walking through the bay or waiting for an expo.</p><p>Mush should never willingly take the serum. It makes no sense.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1502449 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1502449">rumata</span></span><cite><p>A cured Mush should definitely out the others:</p><br><ul><li>Firstly because people can't be asked to roleplay with a knowledge like that.</li><li>Secondly because that single vial of serum means just that: a way for humans to reveal all Mush players. <br>Not a way for everyone to live happily together ever after, but a way to defeat that Mush you inject, and bring down the rest of them with that as well. (not without a fight though)So as Mush you should go to great lengths not to get "cured". Even go as far as flee the ship or suicide if they are chasing you with a needle. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></li></ul></cite>

                <p>The case could just as easily be made that converting a mush back to human is akin to coming out of a coma. Some patients remember something, some don't.</p><p>If *I* were in that position, my preference would be to play it like I was on the verge of remembering, but not quite. Or maybe the other mush body swapped. I'd personally prefer to actually have to *hunt* for a mush and gather real evidence.</p><p>I'm not sure how expecting a converted mush to just give up a name so you can auto kill any other mush on the ship is any different from expecting the other(s) to surrender at the moment you convert one mush.</p>

                <p>I'm aware I might be derailing the conversation a bit, but this is something I've been kind of concerned about: <strong>External Links. </strong>It's come up in conversation a few times on this forum, and it's not clearly defined that they break the rules, even though the mechanics of the game seem to imply that external links are a no-no.</p><p>The first thing that strikes me about this is the use of external chat. At first this sounds great. The in game chat is kind of a pain in the butt if a lot of people have a lot to say all at the same time. But the fact that any kind of chat is restricted to people who have a Walkie-Talkie (until you get certain upgrades) says to me that external chat would make the game too easy by allowing you to dump your Walkie-Talkie early on. Not to mention conditions like coprolalia would be pointless.</p><p>The second thing I've seen external links used for are screen shots. Now, no-one has used this to prove they aren't mush, (which is obviously against the spirit of the game) but instead they usually use this to take a screenshot of their planet scans. The problem with this is, I think it should be a perfectly viable plan for a Mush to lie about a planet scan involving oxygen, only to lead the ship to a sector with nothing in it or a planet with no o2, sabotage the o2 tank, and leave everyone scrambling. I'm sure this could be applied to other areas of the game as well.</p><p>Honestly, if you ask me I don't think there's much question that there should be a rule against posting URLs in-game. Even though there's no official rule against it, there are far too many ways for external sites to break the game or make it too easy for the humans, or too hard for the mush.</p>

Though I doubt that would be a huge problem if we made it clear that off-site communication between players is strictly against the rules. And even then, any communication that might go on there would be pretty unreliable I'd think. Things like google docs, or any kind of image hosting service should be an obvious red flag to anyone handling reports, though, even if the image or document in question doesn't exist anymore. I think we can agree that any site whose main function is to relay information from one user to another, be it in the form of images, chat, or documents that can be edited by several users, should be off limits.</p><p>The problem with a case by case basis is it might be hard to pin down offenders. Like, say I upload an image proving I'm not mush to an image hosting service. With a lot of sites like that I can easily take it down again and claim it was a meme or something and I'm being wrongly accused. It'd be hard to punish that person based on that, but it'd also be kind of silly to leave a loophole like that.</p><p>Personally I'd rather not split hairs and just keep any urls out of the game altogether, but I'm willing to compromise on it if people REALLY want to share videos and music with the rest of their ship. If it became a problem later I would think we could amend the rule. I'm sure Mush are more than capable of reporting anything that would make the game unnecessarily harder for them in the meantime.</p>

We have our rules and they are short, vague, and open to interpretation. Now just because some Beta-testers got here first does not give us the right to translate these rules as we see fit. Each ship will be different and each cast will portray them different. People talk about our day15 serum/mush conversion and say it was wrong. So we say, what will stop people from blatantly making a spore in the lab? Again people say against the rules. So what's to stop people from doing something mushy ( get dirty a lot, move stuff around, do something in fishy in front of a camera) so they get caught? Point being, who are we to judge when a person has blatantly outed themselves as a mush in hopes of serum? Where is the line draw and who is going to judge?</p><p>I say we save the judgement for the habitual offenders and enjoy this game. Too many people get pissed off at others gameplay/style because it doesn't agree with their own. Reminds me of a Survivor, of course you get pissed if you get voted off just like you get pissed if you die in this game. But what happens when you die? <strong>You get the opportunity to play again, it's not the end of the world.</strong></p><p>So relax, save your gripes and play the game for it's intentions........enjoyment. <span class="tid_wspoil">Otherwise why would you pay for something that upsets you/makes you bitter?</span></p></cite><p>I could not have expressed my thoughts on this whole topic any better, thank you, Comedian!</p>

I guess the challenge is to figure out what exactly is "playing against your team". To me, anything provable and obvious. If you have a chat log that says "hey guys, I'm the mush, cure me!" That should be sanctioned. If you have someone is doing mushy things once the serum is made, how do we know why they were caught? We don't. This isn't a flaw of the rules and how they are laid out, it's a flaw of the game itself. Make concealing Mush extremely rewarding. I want to see mush mushing others, then, when they take control of the ship they can fly off to a Mush planet and have a Mush party. Motivation!</p>

                <p>This thread is still relevant and should probably be pulled back on topic and into activity. Personally, I think the serum is going to lead to a few dubious strategies, but a) if it's really that much of a threat to the mush as a whole, they should do as much as they can to keep it from being researched in the first place, and b) at no point should abstaining from doing something be considered actively playing against your team. So say a mush IS transformed into a human: at no point should they be FORCED to either out the other mush or face consequences outside the context of the game. If they, for whatever reason, don't want to reveal the identities of the mush, they shouldn't HAVE to. It's a bad strategy gameplay wise, but they aren't ACTIVELY working against the team in doing that.</p><p>That said, I agree that a Mush actively working to finish the serum for use on themself is a sort of surrender, which is explicitly forbidden. And should be ESPECIALLY against the rules when there are other living mush. If the serum gets finished despite all opposition, well we've hit a grey area in the rules.</p><p>Also, I REALLY think we should make the rule on external forms of communication clear. Sharing your twinoid username, or linking to any site for the purpose of sharing screenshots, chat, or making use of public documents should be punishable somehow.</p><p>So here are the rules as I would write them. This wouldn't be ALL of the rules, mind you, and later they can be changed to be more specific. I sort of want to keep them vague for now seeing as with most people still being in gold mode, the game is very different from what it could turn into after the beta is over.</p><p>1. Surrender is not an option:<br><span class="tid_sideNote">At no point should a player ask to be killed, simply because they feel their team has lost, or because they don't want to play anymore. Purposely injuring themselves with intent to die also falls under this rule.</span></p><p>2. The use of external communication is not permitted:<br><span class="tid_sideNote"> While in game, sharing your twinoid username, or linking to any site for the purpose of sharing screenshots, pictures, chat, or making use of public documents is prohibited. Normally, this does not include linking to videos, music, or other sites not normally used for communication. However, should links to these sites be abused for the use of communication outside the game, that too may be punished under this rule.</span></p><p>Again, this isn't ALL the rules I would like, but if we're really going to split hairs on that URL sharing rule, we should make it clear what sites people can get banned for posting links to. Personally, I'd rather say to hell with it and disallow the posting of URLs altogether, but hey. What are you gonna do?</p>

So here's my idea not to break the rules, <strong>the converted Mush will not be able to communicate with their former human team, thus he/she can not tell who are the Main Mush. Only the converted Mush will have the privilege to be cured, thus the Main Mush should do his best to prevent this from happening.</strong> Not communicating means you are a threat, a possible converted Mush, but</em></p><p><em>For the part of the Humans, those who are killing others by random, those who are killing just because he suspect the ones who are not communicating is a 100% Mush, <strong>if he killed a Mush, he will get a morale boost but if he killed a fellow human he will lose a great amount of morale, maybe good as dead, this way random-killing will be lessen.</strong></em></p><p>My statements are like pro/anti Mush. Pro as to not being pointed out by the converted Mush and anti as the random killing might be lessen or maybe good too since you can easily demoralize the one who killed the human if you are a Mush.</p>

                <p>That's certainly a different playstyle, but it's not playing against your team. At no point is doing NOTHING playing against your team. That should be perfectly obvious. A person who simply isn't at their computer is doing nothing.</p><p>Now let's say Jin Su decides to do other things. He, for whatever reason, finds these things to be more important. Now, I'd say moving the ship to a planet with oxygen on it is... pretty damn important. But making sure Chun doesn't die of Morale loss could be seen as important too. And maybe Jin Su is just inexperienced.</p><p>Now, let's say Jin Su is legitimately doing everything in his power to keep the ship from moving. Let's actually take a look at the events that happened before that. Let's say frieda finds a planet 6 east with oxygen. But just before takeoff, Jin Su notices Frieda is dirty, and she didn't say how she got dirty. Everyone else wants the ship to move, but Jin Su decides he needs an answer from Frieda first. Moving and finding out there isn't a planet could be a pretty destructive action if Frieda was lying. Not only will he waste two cycles moving to the planet and away from it, but they'd also blow 6 fuel, plus the fuel to get out of orbit afterward. So Jin Su takes the Hacker Kit and refuses to move the Daedalus until he is sure there's a planet 6 east, or another planet is found.</p><p>It might seem kind of silly, but there are good reasons someone could do something like that. It's a legitimate strategy. And honestly, what's the point of giving Jin Su the power to move the ship if you aren't going to give him the right to decide when to move the ship himself? If we can ban him for actively making a decision that just seems silly.</p><p>I think this is why the French SDF uses a sort of judge panel system. It's really easy for people to get reported for something that's a legitimate (if inefficient) strategy.</p><p>Now, if I say to you "Move the ship!" and instead you grab the mush sample, the stainproof apron, and a spacesuit, and launch yourself out of a patrol ship... well then we have a problem. Then you actively did something with intent to make your team, the humans, fail.</p><p>I don't think I'd ban Jin Su with the hacker kit unless a lot of people started using that strategy to grief ships.</p>

                <p>As far as humans killing other humans, I think there should be more than a difference of opinion, or obvious annoyance to justify it. Killing someone due to a lack of oxygen is counterproductive, by the way - that's like playing Russian Roulette with extra bullets in the chamber, since it only increases the odds that you will be the next victim once the O2 runs out.</p><p>Malicious actions (intentional or otherwise) are the criteria I'm thinking of in this case. Going back to the example of the Chun I was on a ship with, earlier in the thread...if said player is hoarding the use of something others need, e.g. the apron, the cat, etc. <em>and</em> refuses to communicate, that's an action I would consider malicious, intentional or otherwise. If they are compounding that by eating rations at every opportunity, <em>and</em> they aren't doing anything to advance the ship's progress, say, <em>only</em> working on the mad kube with their AP...then you can add wastage of resources to the charges.</p><p>One can easily see it as griefing, because by wasting and/or withholding mission-critical resources, they are, by little stretch of the imagination, <em>working against their team's progress and reducing the chances of its success.</em> This is what the Chun I described did, and it's obvious that she couldn't be Mush. But she was unjustifiably acting in a fashion that did not benefit her team; it actively hindered it.</p><p>It's one thing if a Mush player were to act in that manner. That's the sort of thing that they can be killed for, and it's well within their obligations to oppose the humans as much as they can. So why should it be justified for a human player (Chun or otherwise) to be allowed to continue actively hindering the crew's progress?</p><p>Another (this time hypothetical) example: Jin Su going mostly inactive, while holding the Hacker Kit. If that player only logs in every day to burn just enough AP to not lose his title, but never moves the ship, the rest of the crew is doomed to die unless they figure out what he's doing and they kill him. They would have no other logical recourse, would they?</p><p>Now a balancing example, from my current ship: Our Finola wasn't coordinating with us on our research, and ate one of the bananas before all the hydropots were filled. When called out about this, she was very confrontational, and we very nearly killed her over these actions, to prevent further wastage. At the time, she was our chief suspect for being the second mush. But there was no concrete evidence of direct malicious intent from her. (I'd describe it more in terms of not fully understanding the consequences of those actions, in hindsight.) We very well could have killed her over those actions, but we didn't. Since that point, she has acquiesced, has been communicating and coordinating more, and assisted in the killing of our second alpha Mush. It's quite possible that we would have been unable to kill that mush when we did, without her assistance.</p><p>So here's the mindset I would take from these events:</p><p>1. Even if the intent of the offender is not malicious, killing may be justified, if there are no viable alternatives, <strong>and</strong> only if doing so will further the survival of the ship.</p><p>2. Killing should not be the first action taken, if threats and/or diplomacy can get the offender to communicate and prevent any further hindrance of progression. This does not mean that they are free of any suspicion, naturally.</p><p>3. If the offender understands that further transgressions will not be tolerated, and they contribute in earnest to the crew from that point onward, killing them afterward should require some evidence of malicious action(s). "Mercy for noobishness", you might say. But said mercy can only extend so far...</p>

Volitionally taking the serum.</strong><br>Is a mush ever allowed to reveal themselves with the intention of being cured by the mush serum and becoming human?</cite><p>Yes. There's no question in my mind that this is a form of surrender. It's stated clearly in the rules that surrender is not allowed. So I'd have to say no. This isn't okay and definitely needs to be sanctioned.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_33139 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="33139">Pause</span></span><cite><strong>2. Obliged to reveal mush.</strong><br>If a mush is converted back to human by the serum (<em>volitionally or other wise</em>) is the player obliged to reveal who the other mush are to the humans?</cite><p>No. There's a big difference between playing against your team and hindering your teams ability to win through inaction. If we start making rules like these we may as well start sanctioning anyone who goes offline for more than 24 hours on a ship. They SHOULD reveal the other mush if they want to win, but under no circumstance should they be required to under penalty via the SDF.</p><p>Again, big difference between actively DOING something, and passively ALLOWING something to happen.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_33139 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="33139">Pause</span></span><cite><strong>3. External Links.</strong><br>External Links have the potential to be abused. How should this be managed?<br>Should <em>all</em> external links be banned, only certain external links banned or only certain links allowed?</cite><p>I'm in the camp that ALL in-game links to external sites should be banned. It's just a lot easier to enforce a clear cut rule like that. Gray areas that leave the rule up to interpretation are a little dangerous for a few reasons I won't get into right this minute. Not to mention we aren't even talking about links. Links don't work in game. All we have are URLs which are kind of annoying to copy/paste anyway. We aren't actually gaining anything gameplay wise through them, and if we are, that's gameplay that wasn't really intended and can wreck the balance of the game.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_33139 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="33139">Pause</span></span><cite>Something new.<br>I would like to hear other players opinions about humans killing other humans.<br>I don't mean killing a human who was a mush suspect, I mean something like... "<em>we are low on oxygen</em>", "<em>that guy hasn't been active lately</em>", <strong>Bang!</strong> ...or maybe something less extreme <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></cite><p>Yeah, I don't see how the humans benefit from killing people who are human. Of course, let's assume this "killer" didn't know how oxygen worked. They thought that maybe by killing off other humans they could conserve oxygen.</p><p>I would say there should be a rule against it, but there should be plenty of warnings for any player who hasn't played long enough to figure out that killing someone you KNOW is a human generally has no benefit. There isn't a Last Man Standing award or anything.</p><p>That's not to say I don't think there's room for individual play in the context of this game. If a player has reason to believe they would raise their position on the leaderboards at the end by making sure the other players can't earn any more glory, I dunno. Maybe they should be allowed to. Or maybe this is another form of surrender; acceptance of defeat. It's possible I'm missing something and certain characters could be given an initiative to narrow the playing field, but for now I'd say this is probably a <strong>very minor offense.</strong> Especially if we're talking about killing an inactive. On a ship that's dying of oxygen loss anyway.</p><p>( Honestly, a character who gains more glory the fewer characters that make it back to SOL does sound kinda cool, but also game breaking. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> )</p>

                <p>Well then I stand corrected. Incentive to kill is there. (Though I personally wouldn't see it as a good enough reason to kill, some people might.)</p><p>Anyway, thinking back on it, it really is impossible for a ship to be 100% sure all the mush are gone. So it's pretty easy for any human to justify murder by saying "I thought they were mush" even if it isn't <em>really</em> true. We make a rule saying "you can only kill people if you have reason to believe they're mush" it's going to be really hard to enforce aside from people who attack Chun, or people who attack others before the mush even spawn. Of course, before the mush spawn is sort of a gray area altogether. Seeing as it's hard to define "playing against your team" when teams aren't even chosen yet. I think MOST of us would agree killing/attacking would make the cut for "against the rules" before the starting gun, but I don't know if all of us would. Thoughts?</p><p>More interesting than this is probably the subject of suicide. I think that has the potential to be not only an annoying habit of certain players, but also a very destructive form of griefing. I already had a ship in which a couple humans kept asking for people to attack them. It pretty much ruined the voyage. Even if it's already sort of implied in the games rules, it should probably be noted other sets of rules as well, and much more clearly.</p>

On on ship I was on, our Stephen cooked eight rations on the first day, <em>before</em> the ship was half filled. I should add, no reason was given, and nobody asked him to do so. We could have killed him for that, to prevent that level of wastage from happening again, but we didn't. As I recall, he never said anything, even after being confronted about it. Later, he went inactive while on the bridge, much to the dismay of our bridge team, since it interfered with the efficiency of my (Paola's) Logistics skill. He stayed there until he starved to death. He wasn't mush, either.</p><p>On any other ship, I'd be inclined to kill and report such a player as a griefer, if communication failed to resolve things.</p>

Not knowing whether I'm going to be mush I decide to hide the apron instead of bringing it to the lab. I mean, what's the harm? I can always go back and uncover it for a single AP if I find out I'm human! But if I DO find that I'm mush, it's going to be THAT much harder for anyone on the ship to figure out that I hid that item because I hid it so early on. Even though it's more likely that I'll be human, the benefits if I turn out to be mush far outweigh the costs if I turn out to be human in my opinion.</p><p>I would argue that before that starting bell rings, rather than all being human you're all POTENTIALLY Mush and should be allowed to play the game under the assumption that you could turn out to be mush. Instead of being on one big "team" it's more like teams haven't been selected yet.</p><p>This probably isn't going to be all that relevant once the game opens up and ships actually regularly fill before day 1 ends, but I feel like it's worth bringing up to get a better idea of what the community expects out of this game.</p>

"<em>we are low on oxygen</em>", "<em>that guy hasn't been active lately</em>", <strong>Bang!</strong> ...or maybe something less extreme <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></cite><br>Simply being low on oxygen is not an excuse to kill another human. However, if someone has been quite inactive, then you need to see what their role actually is and whether they are loitering somewhere detrimental to others, like standing on the bridge and leeching Paola's Logistics skill. For example, I just left a ship that had a Jin-Su who was just active enough to retain the Commander title. I considered offing him so we could get our much more active Chao as commander, but I was Janice and really needed the occasional speeches Jin-Su gave. (It turns out Jin-Su was Mush, so the whole thing was completely calculated.)</p><p>We also had a Gioele who suspected Eleesha was Mush simply because she did not print THE List by Day 2 or 3 and killed her in Bravo Dorm. I could have told him she wasn't Mush because I had recently cured her vertigo, but after she turned out not to be Mush, I killed him and immediately justified myself. Did I play against my team? Maybe, but he had it coming. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p>

I think we should stick with the idea of being all Human before Mush infiltrates our ship.</cite><p>I think there's a big difference between becoming a mush via spores and being picked as mush at the beginning of a ship. If you know what you're doing, you can avoid becoming a mush from spores. No matter what you do though, there's no changing the odds of getting picked as Mush at the beginning of the ship.</p><p>I know what you're trying to say: it sort of sounds like it falls under the "surrender is not an option" rule, but this is different. When you remove skill and strategy from the conditions of the game and leave the selection entirely up to luck, you aren't playing a game you can <strong>plan</strong> to win anyway. There's no such thing as "surrender" when your actions have no power to change your fate. Or at least... the conditions that qualify something as "surrender" are different. After the mush are chosen, luck isn't as much of a factor anymore. Anyone who will become a mush after that will do so because they got hit by too many spores, not because some RNG selected them. Now you're playing against an opponent, not odds. If you play well enough you can get a better shot at defeating an opponent. Not so for luck.</p><p>Besides that, there are a few in-game texts that imply that the people who are selected as mush at the beginning of the game were agents of mush before they even boarded the Daedalus. With that evidence, it would be fair to assume 2/16 people in cryosleep ARE mush, they simply aren't AWARE of it for whatever reason when they wake up. There are other texts that imply different things, but it all boils down to the idea that not everyone is going to assume they're human just because the game hasn't picked the mush yet. Now we're getting into roleplay territory, and deciding whether or not it's REALLY important that a games story matches up perfectly with its gameplay, which is a whole new can of worms.</p>

I don't say you should not play for glory. Only that human and mush glory should not be used to decide if it the humans or the mush that win. You can still compete as human within the humans and mush within the mush, even though a Roland active and knowing what he does is almost impossible to beat. On the mush side, if you are the mush always giving the last spore you win more glory, it is truly unfair. I think the glory for a final conversion should be splitted among the mush who participated in the conversion. I have tons of ideas to improve the glory <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><cite>So what happens if you're turned against your will? What if you don't have 150 glory? What if you were a turned mush and only got 80ish to begin with?</cite><p>The human still need to know to who they should administrate the serum. If they do, then it means you did not play enough good to not be caught... Then you deserve to loose a lot, in principle all your mush glory. Then once you are human you start to gain sone glory again, as a human, rewarding your human actions. I think it is very fair. One can also give a glory penalty to hmans if they use the serum on the wrong person...<br>The same glory problem happens with transfer. You can be a good mush that needs a new body early in the game, you loose all your glory (the human has nothing at the beginning) and you will keep loosing to reach quickly zero. is it fair? And the human gets 120 on day 1 and will keep gaining. is it fair? Or, a mush, hiding for 12 days, not doing his mush job, decide to change body one cycle from the return to Sol, gets all the glory from a human that worked hard, leaving him with nothing. Is that fair? I think the glory should follow during transfer to avoid this.</p><p>I don't pretend having a miracle solution, or knowing better. I only have ideas. The only thing I am saying is that with a better glory system, it will avoid numerous unwanted behavior. But it is utopia to believe that everything could be solved. It will always be problem</p><cite><p>You really need to accept the fact that it's VERY possible (and likely) to play for glory absolutely within the rules of the game.

Proposed further guideline changes were becoming more complex so we've decided to reset right back to the basic set of rules we started with. <a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/qLXA0g/0"></a><a href="http://twd.io/e/qLXA0g/0" target="_blank">http://twd.io/e/qLXA0g/0</a> We've learned a lot from the French game and will be starting our game much in line with theirs. If we see separate English Mush specific issues, we will be tweaking the rules to reflect them.<br><br>Here are issues that have come up and our decisions on these matters.<br><br><strong><em>Anonymity</em></strong><br>We recently said we would sanction for breaking anonymity (revealing Twinoid user names) on our ships but have since decided to reverse this. We almost all agree that anonymity in Mush makes the game more fun! But, it is not fair to sanction those who break theirs. It also creates an atmosphere of overt rule breaking for something quite innocent, which is never a good thing.<br><br>Many find anonymity to be one the best features of this game and chose to keep anonymity at all times. There is no Twinoid fame in Mush, no long time member hero worship and you are free to role play the character you've chosen without anyone knowing who you really are. Because most of us do want to keep our anonymity and not know the identity of others on our ships, we strongly suggest everyone preserve anonymity because it's more enjoyable to play that way.<br><br><strong><em>Spreadsheets</em></strong><br>Because of our previous restriction on breaking anonymity, spreadsheets were out. Using Google Drive at least the owner is known so we said "no" to them and that we would sanction. We were then faced with others sites where anonymity was preserved but I found it too complicated to say yes to one site and no to another. Since changing our stance on anonymity, we have less reason to disallow spreadsheets and other sites used to inventory list. So, we will not sanction for them now.<br><br>That said, there will plenty of time for total organization in private ships when they come. Spreadsheet encouragement on public ships is often futile as not everyone will use them and remember, the mush can see them as well and destruction of important documents is a valid mush strategy. Lists can also lead to tensions as the super organized might pressure the under organized. You can post your link once and please, don't expect new players or those who would rather stay in game to use these tools.<br><br><strong><em>Inactivity</em></strong><br>Inactivity (new players, players not communicating or playing) will not be sanctioned, do not report them. We do not want to sanction new players who might not be engaged. Learning to work around these players is part of our game. You *can* succeed on as ship that has many deaths and/or a fair number of inactives. Luck and team work amongst those left will be in order but it can be done. Thoughtful communication and patience can go a long way.<br><br><strong><em>Ships filling slowly</em></strong><br>There will be the rare times ships might take longer to fill, when this happens we will expect "neutral play". Which means, we don't do anything that specifically will help either team. As an example, killing hunters is acceptable as a mush goal can potentially be to live longer as much as it is a human goal. What's not acceptable is holding or hiding the Mush Sample, apron, weapons and other items. We encourage you not to advance anti-Mush research so that whoever is selected Mush (which could be you!) will have a fair chance at winning. Neutral research examples could be - Ultra-healing Pomade or the NCC Lens. We've also asked Blackmagic to consider having the Mush Sample (needed for anti-mush research) spawn only after the ship is full. Until then, though, this is our best solution. <br><br><br>Remember, Mush is a team sport! You can't actively work against your team be it mush or human! If you play as a human and you sabotage the humans (killing for no reason relate to the advancement of the human cause, taking both showers apart, cooking all the rations and letting them spoil, etc) this is griefing and it will be take very seriously. If you are mush, you cannot denounce your fellow mush or impede the mush cause, you must work as a team.<br><br>Have fun! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></span></span></p>

                <p>1, 2, 3 and 4, definitely, although not all situations are the same. For example, for humans sabotaging human activities, it has to be intentional. Don't go reporting poor beginners who try to understand the game and do all sorts of weird things, you must be certain they're doing it to sabotage on purpose.</p>

                <p>Astralenigma, I can't tell if you're joking! So, I'll reply seriously. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Improving you chances by holding and hiding weapons, or any other item, isn't fair! If you turn mush, the humans are disadvantaged and if you remain human, the mush are at a disadvantage. Neutral play would be noting where the items are then when the ship is full, you can do what is best for your team, mush or human.</p>

                <p>I noticed an interesting situation on a recent ship. We had one experienced alpha mush and one inexperienced alpha mush. The inexperienced mush made the mistake of extracting spores in front of a camera, and the experienced mush got stuck in a difficult situation as they were the next person to pass though that room. Later when humans entered the room it was clear who both mush were by the spore extraction of the inexperienced mush and the failure to report the spore extraction by the person that had passed through the room right afterwards.</p><p>So I am wondering what should the experienced mush have done in that situation. I know that outing your fellow mush is against the rules, but the actions of the inexperienced mush basically condemned both mush. Would it be okay for a mush to out another mush that's going to be discovered anyways as soon as someone enters the room in order to keep themselves from getting discovered? I haven't spoken to the experienced mush as they are dead and the game is still going, but I have a feeling that the inexperienced mush was not communicative as I'm sure the other mush would have been happy to offer advice (they were very communicative with the rest of the crew). Its sort of a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. I believe our mush just decided to lay low and hope we didn't connect the dots.</p>

                <p>kumquat - that sounds *remarkably* like the ship I'm on. If it is, the experienced alpha mush was already under suspicion... mostly for having said early in the ship that she knew what to do and knew her job and she was kinda pro at it, then well... not doing it and never having AP available.</p><p>If she *had* been doing her job, she can fairly easily say she just didn't look at the room logs. I've walked through a ton of rooms without checking the logs... especially when I haven't been there and there are a million messages. I tend to assume that others are on top of it.</p>

The mush killing above would have helped the mush team.</p><p>Each ship and situation are different as well and are looked at as unique. Cases are discussed and analyzed thoughtfully by a large group of people.</p>

                <p>They didn't mention their characters, but Kumquat's post was enough to identify him to Spacekadt as being on his ship, and had Kumquat been either Mush that would have revealed even more. There was no need to rush to post, the question could easily have been held until after the ship was over.</p><p>Having read the rules you linked to (and thanks, I didn't read all 15 pages of the thread), I have to disagree with the new position on anonymity. I don't think there is anything to be gained from this, and a lot to be lost.</p><p>And the way it ties into the ruling on external spreadsheets doesn't make much sense, either. My username on Google isn't the same as my Twinoid username, and it certainly isn't the name of any of the characters on board the Daedalus. So unless someone is watching the spreadsheet <strong>while</strong> I make an update <strong>and</strong> is able to be certain about my recent activities (say, I just posted that I put out a fire, and I'm updating an external spreadsheet with the new location of the fire extinguisher) they won't be able to tie my Google name to my current character, and much less to my Twinoid name.</p><p>The more I learn, the more I am not encouraged to play, even though I have paid for Gold days remaining. And while I have been a fairly vocal critic I have also offered up many pages of suggestions for improvements, assistance for new players in the form of contributions to guides and Q&amp;A, and general forum participation.</p><p>I think Mush could be worth of the "award winning" hype, but at this time I think that whatever organizations or reviewers issued those awards had their heads firmly up their backsides, or just didn't do any kind of credible job of reviewing the game. Or perhaps they work for magazines in which Twinoid advertizes, and had an economic incentive to not look too closely under the hood before handing out awards. Because the several reviews I read all seemed to hype up the "intrigue" and "paranoia" between the Mush and the humans. But right now in actual game play the Mush are <em>typically </em>wiped out by day 3 or 5 and then the game reverts to an intrigue-less and paranoia-less "player vs. environment" game. And why hand awards out for that?</p>

                <p>We aren't in week 4 yet of our live game and not even 6 months including beta. There are changes coming, for sure. There could be changes to mechanics with natural updates and possible tweaks.</p><p>I think the reviewers were seriously impressed the uniqueness of the game. The art is unique as well. This is what has always drawn me to the Motion Twin games I play. The excitement of the mush hunt is a mystery element you normally do not have in a game, so that's something of interest. You have multiplayer games like WoW, LoL, or Diablo that is all about team work but it's fairly linear and, for lack of a better word, mindless. I've played Wow and Diablo a lot, WoW isn't for me but I love Diablo's mindless attack spamming goodness and can't wait for the expansion but it's a totally different game than Mush which takes real thought and communication. So, I can see why some are impressed with the game. That said, it won't be everyone's cup of tea. :&lt; It's a shame you have days sitting on your account. Maybe with future updates the game might be more appealing?</p>

                <p>Maybe.</p><p>But I'll be very patient about spending them. The current status quo where Gold days are expended even if the ship takes several days to fill (during which the Mush can be almost completely shut down by Research projects), where there is no penalty for being an inactive player, and where the Mush have a huge weight of mechanics against them just isn't appealing to me.</p><p>Show me the game where the Mush stand an equal chance, and aren't just a road bump in the way of the remaining player vs. environment play, and I'll be far more interested. That's what all the hype was about, wasn't it? So how am I wrong to ask for what was promised?</p><p>In some hoped for future where the Mush stand a decent chance and where paid for days aren't wasted because of other player's inactivity, I may be more inclined to draw my own paid days down.</p>

Since the question was about the last mush that had just been killed, it's a pretty safe bet that neither of us were mush, but even if we were - I'd like you to point out anything that shows one of us gave anything away.</p><p>I don't know who kumquat (I think that's who it was) is. I've not seen the player name before that I recall and I certainly don't know who that person is on my ship.</p><p>But really, why is that worse than being on a ship with a friend where you *know* who the person is? Yes, I've been in that situation - repeatedly, really. And I've had friends as mush while I was on the human team. And they were smart enough to keep their secret and one of them (DAMN YOU STEVYN!) hid so damned well that we murdered a good portion of the ship while looking for him.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_48256 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="48256">Kompera</span></span><cite>And the way it ties into the ruling on external spreadsheets doesn't make much sense, either. My username on Google isn't the same as my Twinoid username, and it certainly isn't the name of any of the characters on board the Daedalus. So unless someone is watching the spreadsheet <strong>while</strong> I make an update <strong>and</strong> is able to be certain about my recent activities (say, I just posted that I put out a fire, and I'm updating an external spreadsheet with the new location of the fire extinguisher) they won't be able to tie my Google name to my current character, and much less to my Twinoid name.</cite><p>I'm not really sure what your point is here. My google name *is* the same as my twinoid name. And sometimes even displays my real name. A lot of us have a google name that somehow gives away our twinoid names.</p><p>It's not like we're going to see ships full of people telling everyone what their twinoid usernames are.</p><p>We're all unique little snowflakes. The rules aren't going to make every single one of us happy. The best that can be done is to reflect the good of the community as a whole and I think the rules really are moving toward that.</p>

                <p>Kompera calm down. Nothing I posted reveals who I am on the ship, nothing that Speckadt posted reveals who he is on the ship. Acknowledging that we could be on the same ship is really not a big deal. I have seen plenty of people do it on the forums. Besides, the moderator message that scout posted on page 14 says that breaking anonymity is not going to be sanctioned, and we didn't even break anonymity. I do agree that anonymity is good though. Keep in my that in what I posted I left out pretty much every detail possible, what chars were involved, what room it happened in, etc.</p><p>At the time I posted it, the mush are dead and the game is winding down. We are really just waiting to be close to death to return to sol or see if we can reach eden. No harm done.</p><p>And just in case you are wondering Spacekadt and I have not made any attempt to see who the other is in game or speak outside of the game.</p>

You're absolutely not using "and" to mean that you've seen complaints about x and complaints about y? Either construct is valid and mean two entirely different things.</p><p>Because if you say you're using it as the latter, then my taking half of your sentence and responding to it was perfectly legitimate. If you're saying it was the former, well, I'm going to call you a liar unless you can point me to more than 2 of those complaints. (Which is pretty damned reasonable, imo, considering how many you say you've seen.)</p><p>I've seen the complaints about inactives... and to a point, they're valid. Hence my not responding to that portion.</p><p>I've seen complaints about ships that were slow to fill <strong>before the public release of the game.</strong> I've not seen a single complaint about ships being slow to fill since then. I've you've seen some, I'd sure love to know where and see the datestamp on it.</p><p>And I'm so glad you seem to know my forum habits better than I do.
