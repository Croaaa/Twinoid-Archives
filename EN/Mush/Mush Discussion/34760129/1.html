                <p>Yeah, it floors me a bit each time I read someone's comments about how much they care about what gender they play or don't play. To me the characters are like 80% their skillsets and specific mechanics. I barely care about their backgrounds and supposed personalities. When I want my character to have a personality in play, I give it one. How boring is it if every Paola has the same worldview and nature? Why should -everyone else- in the game (who cares about reading up on the character histories) know everything known about your character? They didn't live its life, they lived theirs.</p><p>But yeah. I lean towards 'there's something wrong in the heads of those people who strongly care if their character (or someone elses'<img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> is a specific gender or not'. - except when selecting an appropriate 'do it' partner, of course.</p>

                <p>I don't care if the player is male or female when "doing it" just the same way that I don't care about their RL mushiness when "killing it".</p><p>I think we're sort of conditioned from other games to think that players are male by default. I thought Scout, spacekadt, and Peanutz were male because of the neutral name (and Scout is kind of a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tfportal.de/gfx/screenshots/tf2/tf2_meet_the_scout_01.jpg">guy's name</a>).</p><p>A lot of ladies don't fill out the gender part on their profiles either, for good reason. I wouldn't fill mine out too if the Mr part of the name wasn't a blatant giveaway. On most games I stick to androgynous nicks but MT login won't let me do 3 letter nicks.</p><p>I wouldn't say it's 50/50.. it never is. I can count about 8 confirmed male players on my most active ship. One female (who played playboy Kuan Ti so well I would never have figured the player was female). And the others are unknown, but I'm pretty sure there's at least a lady or two among the group.</p>

Nope, uh uh, not gonna happen. Females are <strong><em>always</em></strong> gonna stick to only playing female characters because our poor little brains just can't comprehend being anything other than female.</cite><p>Oh crap, I'd better stop playing Gioele, then. Heh. <br>I personally don't much care about the gender of the person at the other end of the computer screen. Heck, I wouldn't much care about the gender of the other character if the game didn't make it relevant.</p><p>Impet... the character backgrounds leave <strong>a lot</strong> undeclared. Like, I've kept Janice to her background story each time I've played her, but in one she was super caring and driven by a need to save the mushdaughter she had back on Sol. She wanted, more than anything, to understand mush psychology because it might help her save said daughter. On another ship, she didn't really like people all that much, preferring digital psychology to human, since it was superior and controllable. She took care of the crew, sure, but her real passion was getting NERON just right. Just an example. There's a lot of wiggle room for personality variation in those backgrounds. ^^</p>

                <p>Coming primarily from game communities where women or, at the very least, vocal/publically admitting women are a legitimate minority (such as Valve and Epic Games titles, shooters, Space Station 13 etc), and having little experience with browser games, I find the comparatively large female fraction of this community rather pleasant.</p><p>From my MMO experience, assuming a dude behind any given female character is a well-founded and typically correct decision, which has grown rather tiring, while the other way around remains rare enough to be a surprise. There are at least <em>some</em> subtleties in communication, tone and behavior which differ based on who you're talking to. Not only that, but the general tone and selection of subjects also wildly differ between a neutral, balanced, potentially anonymous community like this, and communities where you know you're purely among other guys/gals.</p><p>There's no set behavioral patterns or rules that apply to any of this - that would be really silly - but undeniable tendencies do exist, and sometimes it's just nice to know. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

If that etiquette of manly and girly was dropped, and games were seen as a way of relaxation and having fun or even jobs (e-sports), then more people, both male and female of all ages, would enjoy them without the peer pressure and without getting discriminated for being a gamer...</p>

Shame on you, but still, you are forgiven <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/likemush.gif" alt=":mush_likemush:" class="tid_ico"><br>Spread the love and enjoy playing.</cite><p>Oh, you took my lighthearted, satirical comment as a personal attack <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">. It was actually for some of the people reading/participating in this thread who can appreciate my humour and think some of the things said here are getting stupid. You could also think of it as a gentle nudge to those spewing crap about women when they have very limited experience yet feel they have a right to speak about us and/or the way we play games. Let me address some points for you though, seeing as I am here.</p><p>You call me ignorant, yet feel you have the right to speak about women &amp; gaming because you have <em>a few hardcore gaming female friends.</em> Really? So you are an expert on women and gaming with your limited experience and have the right to make comments about our behavours, thought processes &amp; habits? I think if anyone should be seen as <em>ignorant</em> it would be a male speaking for women on topics such as this, when really we are quite capable of speaking for ourselves and have first hand experience. So who is more of a 'know it all'? Someone that makes stupid comments about something they know nothing about &amp; have never experienced, or me for trying to nudge the comments onto a different path that doesn't tread on dangerous ground.</p><p>You call this a <em>peaceful and interesting discussion</em>, yet we have people commenting on women's temperament, competitiveness and that we hold grudges the longest? Saying we 'tend to hide' like it is a blanket for all women who play games just from some small experience. This isn't interesting, this is old and boring. As old and boring as racism, and generalisations about religions. <em>Every single person is different.</em> Stop making stupid assumptions about a group of people. Why are females playing games even such a big deal? Why do you need to make theories about it and threads about it and wonder what is going on in our brains. Get over it. We have vaginas, big fucking deal. Let us play the game without having to go into a myriad of reasons as to why we play and others don't.</p><p>So yes shame on me! Shame on me for making a joke that you took personally and made it into an issue. Frankly, I didn't give a shit about this discussion and found the blatant misinformation humorous, but when you call me ignorant after spewing generalisations and then in the same comment go on to make <em>more</em> generalisations, yeah I start to have a problem with that. I do apologise for being so "rude" and using the word 'vagina', though. One day it won't be such a scary concept for you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>I have an idea though! How about you stop speaking for a whole group of people, and I won't use that big scary word again <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. It has been a pleasure, but I doubt I will be back for more. I am here to play a game, and 'spread the love and enjoy playing', not argue with you.</p>

                <p>In my experience, it all depends on the social circles in which you travel. I know quite a few ladies who I could invite over for a LAN party or night of gaming or what have you. Statistically, women tend to be a smaller segment of the player base of very violent video games, which not coincidentally, happen to be marketed almost entirely towards men. For video games in general though, it is approaching a 50-50 split in player-base by sex. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean that those numbers are the same for this particular site, but relevant nonetheless.</p><p>"According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2012, "Forty-seven percent of all game players are women."<br><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_video_games">Full article - women in video games on wikipedia</a><br>Could link to several studies as well, if anyone cares. This is actually a favorite topic of mine, being both a big fan of gender studies and a pretty hardcore gamer.</p><p>By the by, I identify as a space chicken (we have evolved past the need for genders where I come from), and I am offended at not being included in your census. ~;&gt;</p>

Basically I'm a mythical chicken which is genderless xD</p><br><p>EDIT: Yes all those agencies and organizations that did the studies are US oriented.</p>

Go sign up for some college level courses on the history and nature of discrimination. You'll find some patterns, if you bother to pay attention, and focus enough to get them blinders knocked off of you. It's worth studying racial, religious, and ethnic stereotypes and discrimination if you genuinely want to understand the gender ones, and your ability to understand those less... lets use the words 'personally afflicting' categories of discrimination may help you to actually realize what you are (claiming) utterly lack of perception of in regards to your own awareness in this conversation.</p><p>Or, you know, your name, 'Phoenix'? It's fitting, cause you sure are a flamer.</p>

Some of the people living during those times became involved in the debates (and violence, and hatred) with honestly-believed-to-be-well-meaning stances such as, 'that the poor African American slaves don't know anything but how to live as slaves', 'that they don't mind being treated the way they are, they like it', that 'segregation protected them from unfair competition with whites, they can't ever keep up and why shame them by making them try', and a whole host of other, similar and worse sentiments.</p><p>These are evil stances. These are stances which are part of the problem. These are demeaning, rude, belittling, cruel, and perpetuate the problems. They clearly come from a mindset which is part of the problem. We now know and understand stances and opinions such as these to be racist and discriminatory, but it took a lot of education, some of it in protracted court battles, to get the point across. Generations of lessons, and the job is not yet done.</p><p>However, correcting and stopping gender discrimination is not as far progressed as is that racial battle that I refer to.
