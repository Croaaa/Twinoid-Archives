                <p>Hey there everyone, I was just wondering besides this forum where can one find alternate Mush communities, forums or whatever. If any?</p><p>I can't find a Mush community anywhere that isn't dead and not apart of the actual forums here and even at that the only one I know of is the Mush sub-reddit and sadly that one is dead. Don't get me wrong, the forum here is great but I think it would be nice to have a few active places outside of the forums to be able to post Mush related content. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I actually made a post on Reddit about trying to maybe bridge the two communities together (here and Reddit) and have two centralized places where we can share our thought's experiences, videos, stories, fan-art, thoughts or whatever as a community as a whole. It's such a shame to see so many of this games communities die because it doesn't have such a huge player base as I think we all wish it did. I do think if we were all to collectively revive such communities we could expand the number of players playing the game and who knows maybe, possibly less inactives. (Which doesn't seem to be as big a problem as it was when I first started playing a year ago, but maybe that's just me).</p><p>The reason I am saying all of this is because it is a great game, a unique game and offers such great unique experiences with every ship you venture on. The people, the characters the role-players we'll encounter. Some of my best games were had with some great role-players. Some of whom I see in the "Favorite Conversations" thread here on the forum.</p><p>Honestly I just think it would be great to have a big "outer" community on a place such as Reddit where there is a higher chance someone will stumble upon it and maybe try the game for themselves? I think it is a game every gamer should experience at least once and just give it a go. The drama, intrigue and plotting that goes into every game. It's like we are all in our own little TV show or something. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/psycho.png" alt=":psycho:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway, I will finish up with that. Basically I think it would be great to have an active outer community where there is a chance people will see it, join in and make our Mushy experiences even better than they already are. Also I have no idea if I posted this in the right forum. I think I did? <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/stinky.png" alt=":mush_stink:" class="tid_ico"></p>
