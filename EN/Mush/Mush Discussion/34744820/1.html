                <p>Let me start out by saying that I <em>love</em> the idea of this game and what it aims to do and have also supported the game with a purchase for that very reason. However, as a (well informed) newcomer I have a few issues I would like your oppinions on as well as some suggestions (however unlikely they are to reach the French developers). I'll divide it into thematic sections and keep it "short" and sweet for ease of reading - starting with what I find the most important:</p><br><p><span class="tid_wspoil"><cite></cite></span><br><strong><em>Section</em> - Pay To Win</strong></p><p><em><strong>Problem</strong></em>:<br>Gold mode grants too large of an advantage in the form of two extra skill slots. Certain cash shop items restore large amounts of AP leading to scenarios where you can pay to win a fight.</p><p><em><strong>Solution</strong></em>:<br>1) Keep gold mode as is but allow bronze and silver players to work towards the 2nd or 3rd skill slot (respectively) on each new ship voyage - potentially gaining the extra skill slot a set amount of days into the game through ingame actions/work. Alternatively allow the 1 extra slot to be purchased with experience points (once per game).<br>2) Reduce or remove instant AP generation from store-bought items. Movement Points are much less problematic as they cannot be easily and directly used to kill another player. Alternatively disallow player harm a set ammount of time after the ingestion. These items are (judging from similar pay to play based titles) best kept mostly cosmetic/fun or entirely team based.</p><p><em><strong>Reason</strong></em>:<br>A ship can make or break depending on certain characters' available skills especially with multiple inactive people. Bronze mode serves as a good demo for the game but is very limited in its choices (especially as Mush oh dear - more on that later). Silver mode is acceptable as-is but the discrepancy between 2 and 4 skill slots is jarring in most cases and will increase as new powerful skills are added to game. Being able to unlock one of the currently Gold Mode Only skill slots through ingame actions could make Gold Mode more of a 'pay for convenience + small bonuses' while still retaining much of an incentive to buy it. Which leads to..</p><br><p><span class="tid_wspoil"><cite></cite></span><br><strong><em>Section</em> - Subscription Price</strong></p><p><em><strong>Problem</strong></em>:<br>The price of ~10€/month (no discount with longer intervals) is currently too high for a text-based browser game that gives you an average of 30 minutes to 1 hour of game play per day.</p><p><em><strong>Solution</strong></em>:<br>The "simple" solution is to reduce the subscription price. Personally I would pay every month if it was a more in-tune 5€. I realize that a company is here to make money but a space ship without fuel is unlikely to get to its destination (ok, that was a lame metaphor).</p><p>The hard solution is to add many more things to do in-game in order to warrant the price. More on this further down.</p><p><em><strong>Reason</strong></em>:<br>This would not be that much of a problem if there were a lot of things to tinker with in-game. I realize that it's a coffee-break game but having many things to do is not necesarrily a bad thing as long as you're not expected to play 6 hours a day.</p><br><p><span class="tid_wspoil"><cite></cite></span><br><strong><em>Section</em> - Gameplay, Simplicity vs Complexity</strong></p><p><em><strong>Problem</strong></em>:<br>1) There is a lack of detail and use in the way the non-text based part of the game plays out.<br>2) There is a lack of choice in the way characters can do their work.<br>3) There is a lack of need for most characters to move around on the ship - potentially turning the game into a less fun one-room-existence for some characters and limiting the already strained Mush-player's shenanigans.<br>4) There could be more random differences between each new ship you play.</p><p><em><strong>Solution</strong></em>:<br>1) Integrate the isometric view of the ship more in how our daily actions play out by allowing us to move furniture around, block doors, access cameras from consoles to see other rooms, rip up/put down floor tiles, sever/fix electrical cables in rooms, hide items in specific spots of rooms, write messages on the walls, etc. there is much, much room for improvement.<br>2) Allow people to remodel their work environments/rooms to add their personal touch, add small choices in how research/repair/sabotage/piloting/etc is done such as requiring the player to choose how they will do a task and at what cost (think stuff like "-1 fuel to grease engine parts to increase engine repair efficiency".). Add more job-specific (including Mush) small tasks as read above.<br>3) Create random events where Neron requests characters with certain skills to report to a room in order to assess/help with a problem possibly gaining a small bonus to the ship/character in question. Anything to make the easily seen sporadic movement less suspicious.<br>4) If having a semi-random Daedalus is out of question then swap around some of the existing rooms. Variety is the spice of life. Add more random events such as 'corrupt AI Core, holes in the ship (giving a use for spacesuits on board), radiation, NPC Mush invasion, etc'.</p><p><em><strong>Reason</strong></em>:<br>Having options helps keeping people interested in the game and striking a balance between too simple vs too hard will keep allow new players to still easily get started.</p><br><p><span class="tid_wspoil"><cite></cite></span><br><strong><em>Section</em> - Mush Game Balance</strong></p><p><em><strong>Problem</strong></em>:<br>Bronze and Silver Mush players are severyly underpowered and often unable in adding the excitement and sense of danger that is necesarry for the game to not become too predictable. Some times even leading to Bronze and Silver Mush players suiciding or going inactive.</p><p><em><strong>Solution</strong></em>:<br>Let being chosen as Mush become an honor instead of a chore. Grant all four skill slots to anyone chosen as mush. Potentially even add more skill slots for mush only although that may require certain Mush skill rebalancing. Mush is central in the enjoyment of the game for the human crew.</p><p>Give Mush players more options in how they can go about their deeds (as mentioned in a previous segment). Cut power lines, electrify doors, mess with the AI, maybe even being able to remove certain entries from a room's log once a day.</p><p><em><strong>Reason</strong></em>:<br>The heart of the game lies in the crew cooperating in order to make it to either one of the human victory endings, however without mush players the game runs the risk of becomming predictive and stale. A bronze player is a little too severely limited as a mush and the same goes for silver players.</p><br><p><span class="tid_wspoil"><cite></cite></span></p><br><p>Kudos if you've actually read this far otherwise here's a..</p><p>TL;DR: Wonderful game, but lacking in depth, a little too expensive.</p><p>Please flame away and/or present good counter arguments. I realize that none of what I wrote about may change but it serves as food for thought I guess. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>This is a great topic and a very well thought out post that deserves more of a response than "<em>you got the subscription price scaling slightly wrong</em>". I still agree with his core argument that they charge way too much for what they are actually giving us.</p><p>That being said, I think I know why they do this given my exploration of the French and Spanish MUSH. Price scaling and offers vary with each version and I think it's because they charge what they think they can get away with. On Spanish MUSH you have the option to pay for 7 days of Gold mode for what amounts to basically 3 USD. You can also get 31 days for a cheaper price as well. Once again I think Motion-Twin charge what they think they can get away with, whether it is a fair price or not.</p><p>I'll let others read and respond before I address the other points but thank you for taking the time to write this out in such an organized manner. I agree with a lot of your conclusions and I really hope things like this eventually reach the eyes of someone in the development team if Motion-Twin hope to make MUSH a successful long-term game.</p>

                <p><strong>Pay To Win</strong><br>Thought this way at first when I first saw it. We had a thread in the gold players forums discussing what players were best played gold... and the result is that half the characters work just as well bronze. Chun and Jin Su can be extremely effective bronze. Stephen is still almost useless gold with his first 4 skills.</p><p>Characters like Terrence with Technician and Pilot aren't really that great gold. The game has limited APs, so it's diminishing gains, only there to cover up for a missing character.</p><p>Only a few characters like Finola, Raluca, and Gioele have skills boosting each other.</p><p>Vending machine stuff can only be bought once, so it's only a one shot 8 AP hit from that piece of space candy. And there are downsides to a lot of vending machine stuff too. But right now it's possible to prove you're not mush by buying something from the vending machine, which is kinda lame IMO.</p><p><strong>Subscription Price</strong><br>IMO, it's very cheap. It's not worth a cent on inactive ships, but very very fun on active ships. And it's not 30-60 minutes a day on those active ships! I like it because there's little actual grinding, but the game's fun enough that you can talk about it all day with someone. But YMMV.</p><p>Also silver is just a single purchase and also unlocks the secret forum, so you don't lose as much from forking out, unlike many other games which treat you like dirt after you stop paying.</p><p><strong>Lack of detail</strong><br>I agree it can be customized further. But too much choice makes it annoying, so would have to watch for that.</p><p>Yeah, it does get tedious on long going ships and I'd agree that events would be more interesting than getting sheetmetaled twice a day. I'd rather see it more FTL-like TBH, FTL was what brought me here.</p><p><strong>Game Balance</strong><br>I'd disagree here. The objective of mush is to well... be the bad guy. The mush are telling the story. Everyone has to do this round of storytelling.</p><p>The difficulty curve is a little high for the mush, IMO. But it's manageable. I think most people just get a little impatient while playing the mush. There are few passives you really use as mush, mostly showerproof and phagocyte. Trapper, traitor, and fungal kitchen are fun too. But even gold players don't have enough skill slots for everything.</p><p>You can even do a really good job without using any skills at all. The best mush are not the ones who sabotage the oxygen reservoirs and suffocate everyone secretly or hack the terminal and leave the Icarus behind. The best ones are the ones who convince humans to kill each other, convince Hua to go down on the planet solo and die, convinces Roland to run back and forth, feeds false evidence to Chun to confuse the mush hunting group.</p><p>Think bronze/silver are underpowered? Convert a gold player to your side. That's one massive advantage mush have - they can choose who's on their side.</p>

I think the old glory system should be replaced with a new Glory system that combines "likes" with straight up "days survived", and "goals accomplished". I'd like to see some shared goals for each team, with different and obvious values, for the various end conditions, as well as personal goals. As an example, Roland could have his primary goal be "Cool Under Pressure" - Putting out fires and destroying enemy ships would both contribute to this goal, but he also needs to live long enough to achieve it. Everyone has the goals "Return To Sol" and "Reach Eden", although these goals are worth much more for the Mush, with the Mush also having "Destroy the Ship" as a valid (but significantly less valuable) goal. Giole and Paola could have a goal that the other survives, while Jin Su could have a bonus to going to Eden and a smaller goal to explore at least 10 planets or something. All humans have "Research the Serum" as a big goal. Players who died while inactive get no points towards any goals.</p><p>I'd also like to see Mush rewarded instead of punished for playing the long game. Mush goals would include things like "Prevent the Serum from being Researched" and "Prevent the humans from killing any Mush", but they wouldn't be punished for the ship surviving - rather, they would ALSO have the goal of the ship surviving, so long as they were in control, since it increases their odds of seizing the Pilgred or infecting humanities last hope at Eden.</p><p>In the end, every character that accomplished every one of their goals and survived until the ship succeeded should have the same amount of Glory - until "likes" are applied, which I think should be added directly to the Glory score. Because in the end, the ultimate goal is to have fun and insure the other players have fun too.</p><p><strong>Tilting the Odds</strong><br>I think there could be a lot more that is done with the ticketing system, things that would both encourage purchases (benefiting motion twin) while making the game more enjoyable. One of these would be to spend casting ticket to increase or decrease your chance of becoming Mush. (Someone watching your profile could see you spent them, maybe, but they'd have to know to look in advance and even then they couldn't tell if you chose to be more or less likely to be selected Mush).</p><p>There are many players who simply <em>don't</em> want to be Mush, and the game is more fun for everyone if the player's who <em>do</em> are Mush <em>more often</em>. It's not a guarantee. But it would be great to be able to spend a casting ticket to triple or third your chance of being selected Mush, maybe spend up to three casting tickets per ship.</p><p><strong>Rewarding Good Behaviour</strong><br>Finally, it would be nice if on long-lived ships, players with 4 or more likes didn't just get tickets, but also got a coin or two. This would encourage players to upgrade <em>for the good of the entire team</em>, and it would encourage players to <em>spend</em> more regularly since they can earn some of what they spent back by succeeding. It encourages more player dedication and a greater willingness to purchase because it lets the players see what they are missing out on, and it also rewards players who don't otherwise pay but are a positive influence on the game as a whole.</p>

                <p>A few things about the price, it's a niche game by a small company. They have a relatively small player base, which, means the prices will be more high than the MacDonald's type of gaming company. And, the game is unique because of it thus, wort the extra cost.</p><p>It's the same with anything, top of mind is perfume. :3 Niche companies charge a great deal more for their perfumes than designer frags because there is generally more effort put into the end product as they are building these products from the ground up, not working on a template. The end product is also often unique and somewhat challenging in its composition therefore it will never really attract the masses. But, the people it does attract appreciate the interesting products well enough to pay the asking price.</p><p>We who pay for this game appreciate it and don't feel it's over priced. It's not a budget game for sure but not everyone thinks it is over priced for the product you get.</p><p>As for "pay to win" I've paid since day 1, why am I not winning? I won't argue you don't do more well in the game if you're a gold player but to criticize any game because it's "pay to win" is silly. I get some companies only charge for vanity items, I would challenge you to show me a small company making a go of that model. And, if you say Valve, reevaluate your definition of small.<br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_7662326 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7662326">FooBar</span></span><cite><br><strong>Problem: Inactives getting on your nerves</strong><br>This is an obvious problem, it has been discussed a lot.

Why not just use the hacker kit or work around that player? As an example, if Janice is gone (dead, Mush, or not playing) you can work around her. I've seen it done, Janice was Mush we killed her right away and managed to get to day 16 on that ship because Janice is not the only source of morale.</p>

                <p>I like this thread! Games can always be improved, so I hope the development team considers some of these changes. A really interesting game mechanic would be to introduce electrical power. This is a spaceship after all. If a room has a camera, it's pretty much safe right now. But if mush could choose to sabotage an electrical relay for a part of the ship, they could temporarily disable the cameras, work stations, etc. in a given area. That would make it possible to obfuscate the room logs and would keep the human players even more on their toes as they are truly not safe anywhere. Power settings could be controlled in the bios, with a choice to redirect power to parts of the ship to give an efficiency boost to console related activities in parts of the ship as well. This would benefit the humans as well! I think it's a really basic concept such as oxygen and fuel that every spaceship needs, but has been overlooked for now. It would be great to put this in and add to the realism and game options in my opinion! Let me know what you all think!</p>

                <p>It would also help offset the loss of players or inactives. I'm playing a game where we got rid of mushy Paola and Frieda is afk. So it's amazingly hard to keep up with those duties. Power boosts would I think also alleviate your biggest complaint, that of inactives on ships without going against what the developers want for the game. It would allow ships to get past the losses of vital crewmembers, although it wouldn't completely make up for it. And it gives the mush more options as well so it's not heavy handed. Plus, I just want to see the lights go out like in horror movies so they can flicker back on revealing a dead crew member and ramp up the suspense <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Games can always be improved, so I hope the development team considers some of these changes. A really interesting game mechanic would be to introduce electrical power. This is a spaceship after all. If a room has a camera, it's pretty much safe right now. But if mush could choose to sabotage an electrical relay for a part of the ship, they could temporarily disable the cameras, work stations, etc. in a given area. That would make it possible to obfuscate the room logs and would keep the human players even more on their toes as they are truly not safe anywhere. Power settings could be controlled in the bios, with a choice to redirect power to parts of the ship to give an efficiency boost to console related activities in parts of the ship as well. This would benefit the humans as well! I think it's a really basic concept such as oxygen and fuel that every spaceship needs, but has been overlooked for now. It would be great to put this in and add to the realism and game options in my opinion! Let me know what you all think!</cite><p>That is interesting. Maybe there could be a new electrical room at the back of the ship where now there's just a gap. Also, you could start implementing the notion of daily fuel loss. Depending on how much power you put in electrical power, you could increase efficiency to different parts of the ship if you're willing to use the amount of fuel required.</p>

                <p>I was thinking the power substations could also be used to send a power surge that will overload the circuits, possibly causing fires along the electrical lines path. There are endless options for it! Nexus projects that better regulate energy efficiency, a dampener that would prevent harmful power surges. You could introduce the concept of energy use, for example plasma shields would eat up a lot of energy, dismantler none. One of the characters who don't have 6 levels of skills could have a new skill, Electrician. It's a neat idea!</p>

                <p>Yes, this certainly has much potential. Question is whether the devs will listen or not. Instead of a new skill, maybe a new title that Terrence or Raluca can start out with.</p>

                <p>Good ideas npfan! I like the fuel use to increase electrical output. And it might make more sense as a title. It'd give Raluca something more to do near the back of the ship. Title changeover could go to Terrance, then maybe Stephen, pilots then others. I would hope that the devs would at least consider it, weigh pros, cons and work required. Mush would have a lot more options open to them, but it could also be their greatest weakness. If you can trap a mush in an area and do a deliberate power surge, it could act like the flamethrowers in the movie The Thing, setting it on fire!</p>

                <p>Hmmm... I wouldn't necessarily say that this game is overpriced for what you get (I do rather love this game <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico">). However, I would say that it's too expensive for me, personally. I used 2 mtpasses to get silver, and that's how I intend to stay unless either my job situation improves or the price gets lowered. It's $151.96 a year at current conversion rates for gold mode.... if you play continuously, which I do prefer to do, with a few exceptions. That might not be a lot to some, but it's a very lot for my budget, and for most, if not all, of my offline friends who I've been trying to get hooked as well. Now, if the price were to be dropped to say, half that, and approach a range that's more traditional for browser games, I think I'd be able to swing that, since I do enjoy the game and would like to support it more. And I do think that enough people other than myself would be enticed to pay consistently at lower rates such that MT would probably come out making more money through quantity than they do at the higher rates. Not that I expect it to happen, given die2nite experience.... But maybe MT will lower prices once the initial rush of people buying to get silver is over and sales dwindle some. One can hope.</p>

                <p>In my opinion, this game is completely overprized. For 40-50 € you get an AAA title that you can play for as long as you want. Here, you get 5 month. And while I really like this game, it is not an AAA game. It is a browser game. Even half of what it currently costs is too much, although at 5 €/month, I would consider buying Gold every now and then. As it is, I bought Gold once to get Silver, and that's it.</p><p>And then there's the casting mechanic, which makes the price even more ridiculous. If I understand it correctly, you most likely have to buy tickets for that, too, at least if you want to participate regularly. I'm apparently very lucky with my current ship, because there aren't many inactives, but from what I've read here that is more the exception than the norm. So, in order to not waste your Gold days you better buy those casting tickets, too. Way too expensive.</p>

                <p>Basically, I see it this way: I'll happily pay $50 for entertainment for a month, including movies, games, witty t-shirts, etc. Maybe more if I'm making a lot of money that month, but that's my usual minimum. If I'm playing Dwarf Fortress or Unreal World that whole month, I'll donate what's left of the budget to them. Or if I'm bored, I'll fund some Kickstarter to get an alpha version of a game I'm looking forward to.</p><p>I generally don't buy AAA games. Since playing Mush, I've never actually bought any games. And the game's given me more fun than say, Fallout 3. YMMV. It's only worth it if you don't buy any other games simply because you're buying this one.</p><p>But personally, I think the lack of time needed to play the game helps. I take about 10 minutes of breaks every hour and it's perfect for checking into Mush. The major browser games like Eve Online, WoW, Guild Wars would never fit into my schedule.</p><p>Also "freemium" browser games go for about $25 a month last I checked. More in some cases. Guild Wars 2 premium is $70.</p><p>It's also a little early to be judging on castings. I have no intention of getting them and am only paying for Gold on a ship by ship basis. Agreed that it's just not worth paying for inactive ships. But we'll have to see the final price and implementation before we know.</p>

                <p>I don't feel the price is the main issue, but just because I don't feel I need to upgrade to Gold that much. The game is really playable both in Silver and in Bronze... but I would appreciate mush getting more mush-skill slots unlocked even if they're bronze/silver.</p><p>Also, what if the price scaled a little better? Couldn't MT keep the price for one month 10 euros (for people paying once for silver) but give us some really big discounts for 6+ months of gold mode bought?</p><p>I understand this is a niche firm, but also for that having 60 euros <strong>now</strong> (for one year of gameplay) instead of getting 10 euros now and then (and only when one finds a ship worth spending them) seems a good reason to give something as big as a 50% cut in prices for people who want to spend their money <strong>now</strong>.</p><p>I think it could also stop some gold players complaints against inactive: yes, a ship full of inactive people still makes you lose gold days, but you either (1) have them because you spent your 10 euros to unlock silver mode (so your aim was silver, not gold), or (2) got them at half the price and have so many of them you don't care.</p><p>Anyway, I'm not sure economic suggestion by players could/should really be considered by MT ^^''' they're the ones running the business. I'm sure they're reasoning about their prices already. There is not so much we can say about that.</p>
