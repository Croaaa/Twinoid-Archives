                <p>How was your first game as a mush? Were you an alpha or turned? Did you do well or accidentally mutated? Mine is this <a target="_blank" href="http://http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4761">one</a>. This one was mostly due to stupidity. I asked Terrence to do the thing with me (I'm Janice) since I was low on morale. But, since Myco Alarms weren't done yet, he just spored me directly in the corridors/engine room (I was one of the few actives so I had to help with both Research and PILGRED. It wasn't very long because our ship blew up before we could have gone to Sol.</p>

                <p>My first time was on my second ship, <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3461">this one</a>. Terrence very quickly revealed himself with some silly mistakes while we dealt with a griefer Stephen and I ended up killing him. Although I wasn't proven human, I became very trusted among the active crew. Janice did very well as a quiet Splashproof/Trapper Alpha, building the Babel Module meant I caught the AB2 and RC traps right after one another and was turned.</p><p>Chao and Gioele had been arguing for most of the ship, and being the only one that RPed with Gioele, was the only one he trusted when he locked himself in a Storage with the Lizaro Jungle. Of course it was a great shame that the human side was torn apart, with Gioele killing Chao and maiming Finola. Frieda and Finola took him out, but unfortunately all the inactives starving meant the latter died of Morale loss just after Janice turned off death messages so that I could finish off Finola discreetly.</p><p>Hua being one of the last sensible people left around worked out Janice must be Mush despite me having defended her before; for some reason she spent a good chunk of AP killing a mostly-inactive Roland. Having managed to "secure" the Lizaro Jungle, I shot her either side of a cycle change and managed to confuse Frieda into inaction while Janice finished off Hua. With only the two Mush and Frieda left, we brought her down to only a few HP; one more cycle and we'd have been Assassinated by NERON instead of the hull just giving way to the Hunters outside.<br>Despite a murder and two near-deaths at my hand, I managed to get "Violence is Evil". I also got it <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4035">as Roland</a>, despite killing three people.</p><p>You forgot the colon after http in your link, by the way.</p>

                <p>My first time as alpha mush I saw that my partner is Raluca, so I asked her to pretend to be inactive and accumulate AP for the Pilgred rush. I extracted 2 spores right after the mush selection and secretly showered in Alpha Dorm. Raluca extracted 2 spores and stayed dirty. I created a lot of nice-looking threads, talked with some humans, worked 2 times on Antispore Gas and went offline until D3C1, so humans didn't even suspect me. We repaired Pilgred on D3C1, she transfered into Jin Su and returned everyone to Sol. <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4713">The End.</a></p><p>P.S. I was playing Ian.

                <p>First time I was a beta mush. Caught a trap, not sure where. Either PILGRED(was Raluca) or picking up the wrench. I run out of MP/AP in Icarus. Stephen and Chao come in and spore me. I discover Stephen's partner was Paola, who was inactive. He had two betas, with an inactive partner. This guy was good. We decided to PILGRED rush then kill the commander, giving command to Chao, and Soling it. Chao got bored and killed several people. I think he killed five at least. Stephen guards his dorm, they kill them both, I am only one left besides Paola. I go in dorm, mutate, punch Jin Su twice, run out of AP, get murdered while I'm away. They ran out of oxygen and died though. Mwahaha.</p>

                <p>First time I was beta mush as <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/3100">Hua</a>. It was generally pretty disorganized and noobish ship, although there were some active players. They just didn't work together much.<br>Our alpha mush Eleesha outed herself just a cycle after mush selection by visiting engine room and extracting spore there with camera present. She was killed shortly after that by Raluca, Gioele and Roland in full dorms just to find out she was a human. There were some talks about transfer, but I was one of the people in that dorm, so I wasn't the one to be invited into the mush hunting thread. I just had my piloting job and stick to that.<br>Not long ater that, Chao killed human Gioele, Stephen starved to death and since Janice was semi-inactive and hanging most of the time in the Nexus or cooking all the rations and Jin Su was a bronze pilot, morale started to be an issue. It was when Roland, with which I was talking privately for some time to organize our piloting and thus was trusting towards him, came with a claim he just had a panic attack and needs to raise morale. For some reason I agreed to do a thing with him. Then I went about my bussiness ...</p><p>...just to get spored twice by picking up NCC Lenses from bay shelf. Roland was (accidentally) left behind by one of the ship moves shortly before that and confirmed as transfered Eleesha, but there were still alpha Paola and beta Raluca he managed to infect.<br>There wasn't need for some devious plan. It was day 5 and ship was already damaged badly from hunters. I took anonymush, pretended to try shooting hunters while not, infected Schrödinger for good measure and saved APs for potential ramapage, if that was needed. Ship exploded not more then day after that.</p>

Quite a few inactives, including a Chao in Alpha Bay 2 that I was going to convert so I could take anonymush and go to Sol. From what I remember, pilots were scarce, so AB2 wasn't much of a priority, and my partner Eleesha went silent after I mentioned it was my first time as mush, not sure what happened. In the end, it was pointless, since the update killed us anyways. So I guess that was a win? At least I got two titles by the end. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>So far I've only been a beta, as Frieda. Alpha Paola spored me twice on the bridge, then after an expo Alpha Roland asked for a heal. When I arrived to give it to him... bam, converted. Unfortunately it was a mess of a ship, and all I had to do to seal its fate was feign being offline while commander Gioele begged for someone to load fuel before he went afk for a couple days. The resulting non-movement doomed the Daedalus to hunters.</p>

Happily, this was way back when the most of the server was semi-n00by so in the end, it paid off <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The ship basically murdered each other while I sat quietly and spewed spore traps everywhere. Roland murdered Finola, Chao killed Freida, Roland killed Chao, my partner got killed too, but he didn't do much.</p><p>My favorite part was right after I converted Raluca. She went inactive immediately after but I didn't take anonymush so the crew started wildly speculating once they noticed. Apparently, I appeared totally trustworthy because Roland soon contacted to tell me that he rounded it down to two set of mush; Chao and Eleesha. We planed to get Chao to kill Eleesha and kill Chao together if Eleesha turned out human. Unfortunately, Chao later got killed for killing Freida and Eleesha got cleared somehow. Roland leaves the chat, probably suspecting me. <strong>I invite Eleesha into chat and tell her Roland was clearly a manipulative mushroom. Eleesha proceeds to kill Roland in a rage, which causes the rest of the crew to commit suicide</strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I didn't even get the chance to take actual in-game mush actions that had any effect on the game both because I was a n00b and because people with 1-2 spores were getting murdered.</p>

                <p>I was Andie as Alpha with a partner I can't reveal because the game is still ongoing :c</p><p>The first days I refused to research anything because someone had kidnapped the apron and went inactive so I just lazed around the lab sporing Ian, unfortunately he was somewhat inactive so my plan to have him move, murder Chun and escape with the sample and book failed there.</p><p>Fortunately the human side was really bad, I mean seriously bad. My partner was dirty and running around the ship just sporing people and dropping prepped food around and somehow no one thought twice about him. We didn't even had to move and half the crew murdered each other while our numbers grew:</p><p>-The third day Jin Su died from hunger, Giole became commander and moved the ship to save us from hunters, leaving behind Hua who hadn't told no one she was out.<br>-Frieda found that to be enough evidence to kill Giole, even though he had done a food test earlier on the lab (whoops, seems I forgot to report that).<br>-Kuan Ti later attacked Janice because he though she needed to be on foot to give morale, later apologized on chat and got his neck bitten out of his head by Janice who tried to murder Terrence as well for god knows what reasons. Funny thing my partner was there when that happened and came out unscathed.<br>-Eleesha kills Janice with very good reasons and then Raluca jumps on Eleesha without explanation.</p><p>At this point I decided to screw subtlety and throwed a grenade on the dorms with Frieda, Terrence and Schrödinger, hoping they'd be easy pickings from Janice rampage, they weren't and I found out Schrödinger laughs it's filthy paws at grenades.</p><p>I had to murder Terry by hand and was too tired to get Frieda who ran to the bridge but didn't announce my mushery so I took the chance and at cycle change I ran at the lab took a blaster and shoot my furry witness.</p><p>Funny part is that Ian woke up and mutated just as I got to the lab and killed off Chun which, coupled with my little rampage, helped us get Raluca, Paola and Stephen to kill themselves at day change. In the end I died by blood loss and the score after I left was 3 humans VS 2 mushs</p>
