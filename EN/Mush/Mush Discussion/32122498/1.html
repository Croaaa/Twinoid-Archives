                <p>I find it rather hard to have fun with this game. I personally have no problems with it and do enjoy playing it but, to be honest I find it rather tedious.</p><p>When I'm playing as a human i find that sometimes when I'm trying to learn a new character people are not open minded to the fact that i simply am trying to do just that and learn the character instead they jump to kill me. I understand that being on alert to possible mush hidden on the ship is a concern after all you only have one for sure person you can trust but, to kill a person for asking a question or not doing something right without even asking why they did it i find that to be to annoying and that means that many new players are going to find it hard to learn their characters. Reading is possible since you can translate the french wiki but, sometimes reading about a character is not the same as being able to play them.</p><p>Another problem I'm having with the game is that As a human the ships i have been on are telling everyone that they have to be on so often some even saying every 2 hours others every 3 and that if a person is not on often they must be either Mush or inactive. I find it rather ridiculous that people are taking the game so far as to actually tell people they will be killed if they remain inactive or do not get on every 2 or 3 hours. People do got lives and can't spend their whole day logged onto Mush some people got work. And I do understand that the game requires communication but come on die2nite doesn't require a person to be on half the freaking day. At least maybe once or twice a day at most but every 2 or 3 hours? I think not.</p><p>Mush wise one of the problems I have is that i find often then not while being a mush can be fun if you become a mush with a character that just sucks at it your game is going to be either really slow, very fast, or just neutral with the end result being the Mush are dead. I think with some of the characters you should of better planned out what they can do because some of the characters due to their job on the ship make it very hard for them to carry out their job as mush no matter how much they try to act as the french wiki says Normal and most times i find that as a mush all you can do especially if you are the only mush left is to just help along the ship because alone some characters just can't hack it.</p><p>My second problem as a Mush is that I think it is to easy to be discovered. With some of the human abilities and how fast things can be completed I feel that it is always a race against the clock for the mush with the mush always going to come in last with only like the few 5% of the ships actually being taken down by the mush. I don't like that covert actions that can be done and are pulled off successfully by a mush can be discovered by Chun who simply needs to go into a room and read a persons last action...I mean seriously that is utter crap. I have a friend who shared his experience with me that played the game infected someone with a spore only to be found out by Chun later. I think that not being able to be infected is enough of an advantage over the Mush that she shouldn't have the skill to read a person's last action.</p><p>I feel that this game is centered more towards the humans then the Mush and that its kind of set up so the mush chances are already pretty much down the tube and the only way the Mush will ever really win is if they get a ship that is full of uncoordinated or inactive members.</p><p>I think a set up like die2nite would be a lot better then just throwing everyone on a random ship every time. Throwing people into a ship where the skill level is the same will make the game better for everyone and at the same time give them a chance to learn the characters and the game. Plus it will let them see if the game is something for them and before they get thrown into a higher level ship with more experienced players they can choose to either drop the game or play it.</p><p>Overall though I still can't say that i hate the game or dislike it i just think it could use some improvements.</p>

                <p>I agree with you and sympathize with you, EdelRose.</p><p>The game requires a lot of play to pick up, and that is poor design. The tool tips do not provide complete information about the function of whatever action might be taken, and that is poor design. The Mush seem to rely upon human play incompetence rather than smart play to win, and that is poor design.</p><p>In short, the game appears to be poorly designed.</p><p>There is no reason why a player of a character with a specific skill should have to guess about how it works. Skilled people know how their skills work <em>in real life</em>. There is no reason that a Mush should have to learn how their abilities work via trial and error, especially considering that any given player is only Mush 1 ship in 8. And while I can't say that myco-infected humans know how their skills work <em>in real life</em>, in a game setting it's not such a terrible stretch to presume that the Mush should know how their skills work.</p><p>The game would be drastically improved by a comprehensive rules description. And also improved by a change to how Mush operate so as to offer some chance to 'win' as a Mush player without requiring that the human players suck.</p>

                <p>I like the game, or atleast the concept.</p><p>But i can see that in an enviroment of mostly bronze / silver players this game is going to be frustrating.</p><p>The insane exp grind upon release, will encourage you to focus on specific characters.</p><p>However, most characters job's are very specific and can only become quite repeditive over time.</p><p>For example : I have recently been playing Finola, leveled to the 4th skill. She spends nearly all of her time in the research lab. Which consists of either waiting 24 hours without a bed standing up, or waiting 12 hours in a bed. All to funnel 2ap bursts into the research computer.</p><p>Something that also requires another active crew member, so you can do your job efficently.</p><p>Sure that might be interesting once.... but playing her multiple times? I personally can't see the joy in that.</p><p>Not the most exciting gameplay for 10 euros a month.</p><p>A bronze level finola would be painfully lackluster for the entire ship.</p><p>A silver level finola would be average for completing research projects alone.</p><p>A gold level finola is basically needed. Not only is she a source of efficient free heals, but her diplomacy skill saves a tonne of damage / death from expos.</p><p>Then add in the additional microtransactions on top of the monthly fee, which are basically game breaking.</p><p>99% accuracy on turrets? Who doesn't want that?</p><p>Its like playing a slower version of die2nite, with the same disadvantages that inactives and free to play players bring. With no means of filtering into gold sub only ships.</p><p>Guess when it boils down to it, this game just isn't for me. Guess i'm just over MT's slow play, time gate mechanics with over aggressive pricing structures, and a crippling dependance on other players to not only pay, but have wiki like knowledge, be active, and play well.</p><p>Strange love hate relationship I have with this game. But i just can't see myself playing this after the beta ends.</p>

This way players are not outmatched by knowledge of them game with players who have been playing longer. A system like Die2nite where they use soul points to decide when you can go to more experienced and harder maps i think personally works very well. You get to play the small maps learn how to play the game, see if you like it and by the time you reach 100 soul points you should know if you like the game enough to continue playing heck after like 2 or 3 towns you know if you like it or not.</p><p>Since many problems stem from having inactive players on ships who most likely were not able to get into the game then they should consider a system that lets new players get on a ship and see if they like it this way they don't get on a ship of serious and experienced players and ruin what could possibly be a good ship by deciding they don't like the game or how much time it requires to play. Thus the complaints about inactive players could be solved. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Mush wise i just think they need to even the odds and give the mush a fighting chance against the humans. I agree that it does take just as much coordination between mush as it does the humans to be able to accomplish their goal. However when you got the humans who can work fast and get things done within two days because of their skill set its not fair. Starting off with two mush is not bad but, i think it would be fair maybe to consider at least 3 mush to start. Since a mush can only extract 1 spore each that kind of puts the mush at a disadvantage given all the research that the humans can do in one day. Three mush would at least give the Mush a fighting chance especially against a character like Chun who can pretty much destroy the mush on her own with the right skill set. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The Mutate ability is also kind of stupid to have for the mush. It just doesn't do what it needs to and it seems more like a suicide move then anything else. I mean you guys say Suicide is against the rules in the game but seriously the way i see it its like you guys put a big suicide button in the game for the Mush called Mutate. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/chart.png" alt=":chart:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I like being a human in this game but i wish i could enjoy being a Mush more because I'm sure it would be and could be fun if a little more thought could be given to them and more of a fighting chance for them could be given as well. I hate that their only chance of survival is if the ship is full of badly coordinated or unskilled players. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As for playing after the Beta I don't know if i do i don't think i will be paying to play anytime soon.</p>

                <p>There isn't that much to do that you can't try out most of what the game has to offer with every character.</p><p>There's scanning planets, usually best left to Frieda but anyone can access the computer to see "oh, this is where you scan planets". Only the comms officer can advance communications, but everyone can access the computer to see "oh, this is where the comms officer does communications deciphering and where everyone establishes the connection to Sol".</p><p>Repairing Pilgred is practically a Raluca job, but as for Neron research and lab research, results will vary based not only on the character, but their chosen skill set. Playing Jin Su once, I checked Neron and there was a project I only gave around a 5% contribution for, but after leveling up and selecting skills, my contribution in that project skyrocketed to 15%. Check back frequently and see if you can help out on a project by project basis.</p><p>My problem with this game is that it practically requires frequent checking in for discussions (like Die2Nite), but AP production is way too slow and actions way too expensive. Firing the turret may only cost 1 AP, but when it takes an average of 2.5 shots to make one hit, and 2.5 hits to kill one hunter, that's upwards a day of waiting for enough AP to kill ONE hunter. Yes, taking a ship out is better, but 2 AP to launch, 2 AP to land and 2.5 shots to kill one hunter, I'm spending about the same amount of AP one a single hunter unless I plan to stay out in my iron coffin for 2+days or until the ship needs to move.</p><p>There's just no feeling of accomplishment. It's like pre-endgame in Die2Nite when everyone needs to stay in and build. I hate those phases in town because of that same lack of feeling of accomplishment. Otherwise, scavenging may be slow going, but every couple of hours you log in, if not for forum games, you have auto-searches giving you random items, and any single search can be a game changer for either your or your town's plans.</p><p>This game, I just feel like I'm doing a whole lot of waiting for an accomplishment that never comes. Only game I do more waiting in is Kingdoms, but that game can last a well over a month, so while there's still a lot of waiting, at least in Kingdoms there's enough time to reach milestones and accomplishments.</p>
