                <p>I've been on three ships so far, and the game has been pretty fun when people work together. However in almost every game, at least half the players have been inactive. In my current game our captain is inactive, and most likely all the Mush as well as the Neron administrator.</p><p>This game is great, but inactivity destroys it. That combined with how hard it is to have skills without paying real money makes it extremely hard to have all necessary roles filled out. On one of my ships we could not do any repairs because everyone was a new player, and it's impossible to have a technician without a player being at least silver or have played before and put the xp into Raluca or Terrence. Get makebooks you say? Not when the comms terminal is the one to break, and I spend 10+ AP to try to fix it.</p><p>I really think something needs to be done for it. I would gladly continue paying gold if I could ride with gold ships. Skip the skill system and just let me play with other active players, I'd be more than happy. But segregated communities is not good either, perhaps some sort of activity feed. People who have been active on several ships has a chance to join high-activity ships.</p><p>Either that, or make it easier for new players to get more skills. A 2nd skill should be open to everyone, not just silver members. If we're going to have to deal with 5 or 6 inactive players on our ships, at least make sure that most people can get some variety, and fill roles that are not active. I feel that something needs to be done, and not just trying to stack a game with players on Sundays - which is a cool initiative, but it won't help the game as a whole.</p>

                <p>I imagine inactive players are never going away - like Dead or Alive - but it seems like coordination and mutual play are even more important in MUSH, and there's a steeper learning curve. My 1st ship had a kind group leader who tried to help us out, the 2nd was largely inactive and those on board talked to each other (and not to me). The 3rd seems a little bit better, but we're all noobs and about to die. At what point does this game become fun?</p>

No pilots? Let everyone fly! No astrophysicists? Change the BIOS priority and look into Quantum Sensors. Chao or Ian gone mush/rogue? Build the Natamy Rifle and disintegrate them with ease.</li></ul><p>Inactives are just like dead or mush players (although mush often have to be a little helpful to stay hidden); even in a perfect game, the crew has to learn how to cope with less than a full roster. I understand that people are going to complain about having to pay to remain competitive. However, this game is only boring if the crew lacks communication, cooperation, or creativity.</p>

But inactives are destroying the funness, and worse, making Gold-paying players feel like they're wasting their money.<br><br>So, to improve on activity, may I suggest we have some form of a "MENTOR" system?</em></p><p><strong>Who should be mentors?</strong><br>Any super active players who chooses to be one.</p><p><strong>Super active?</strong><br>Players who have never been idle, even once, in their last 80 consecutive cycles. Also, this person makes at least 5 posts in chat every day.</p><p><strong>What should mentors do?</strong><br>At the start of every ship, Mentors must offer their help to all "new players" (and sell the game a bit <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">), and answer ANY questions that was asked of them. Mentors must also engage actively with these new players (instead of just answering questions), therefore making the game more fun for them, and showing them the best part of this game early on: the social aspect.</p><p><strong>New players?</strong><br>Players who has less then 80 cycles under their belt are automatically new players.</p><p><strong>How do we keep these mentors accountable to their jobs?</strong><br>Have a feedback system everytime a newbie dies (beyond Day 2). Ask if a Mentor offered their help, and if they speak to them?</p><p><strong>Sounds like a lot of work. Why would anyone want to be a mentor?</strong><br>Because we'll reward them with something. Say...allow one of the Gold skill slots to be "unlockable only if mentor". This will encourage life-Bronze players (people who will never pay) to be mentors and guide the new players to Mush salvation, thus ushering in more potential Gold players. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>That's a nice reward! But, what if someone stops being helpful once they're a mentor?</strong><br>Then we revoke their mentor status, and thus that wonderful skill slot (if they're not Gold).</p><p><strong>What about paying Gold players? This sounds unfair...</strong><br>Well, Gold players don't have to be a mentor, since they get the skill slot automatically anyway. HOWEVER, If we <em>really</em> need to reward them further...maybe this: at the start of Cycle 1 from Day 2 onwards, Gold players who are ALSO mentors gain an extra 4 EXP (i.e. 1.5x faster to gain high level skills).</p><p><strong>One last thing...</strong><br>Since we're making a distinction between super actives (never idle in last 80 cycles, and posts 5 times in chat every day) and everyone else...we should reward them with something, too, to encourage even more activity of long-time players. Say...a Klix for every day they are super active? Is that too good?</p><p><em>Okay, I'm done. What does everyone think? The reason why I want to reward super active players and mentors is because they help with bringing new players in (and thus more gold players), so I believe they definitely deserve the rewards. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></em></p>

But, it is an alternative for the future. <a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/8LHK0g/0">Castings Explained. </a></cite><p>Given how scarce the tickets are, this just seems like a cash grab. It's already hard to justify paying even for the bare minimum one month of gold mode when you know you're going to be stuck with inactives regardless, and so we're expected to shell out more for these tickets? I'm not convinced.</p>

                <p>Seriously, the current situation is such that if (and that's a big if) you decide you want to stick with this game, the most you can reasonably commit to is getting gold for one month in order to have the permanent benefits. Maybe make the best of it and try to wring all the XP you can out of the double bonus. After that's gone, and having used up your miserable handful of casting tickets, the smartest way to play this game would be to simply see if you have an active ship each time a new game starts, and if it doesn't suit your standards, simply join the idlers and wait for the next one. With any luck, it'll crash and burn a little faster that way and you'll get another shot at a ship with a proper crew. Resubscribing with the game like this would be foolish, since it does so very little to remedy the problem (and not even that until castings go live).</p>

                <p>I don't know if this has been suggested before, but I see how some kind of system to separate "newbie ships" and "experienced ships" would work perfectly for this. Something similar to the soul system used in Die2Nite. If you get X points of accumulated days survived (or glory, but it doesn't accumulate I think) you can then access experienced ships.</p><p>Actually, being Mush a game that requires even more participation than Die2Nite, I don't know why a system like this is implemented in Die2Nite but not in here.</p><p>But maybe we'll need to wait for a few updates of the game, because it seems a pretty obvious thing to have.</p>

It's apparently a mush strategy now.</cite><p>I don't agree on that. There are only two reason to kill inactives:<br>1) If they hold a title the ship needs (but please consider that if they are totally inactive Neron will give it to someone else anyway).<br>2) If they survive 5 days without eating, since that really puts them into the "suspect Mush" list (yes, inactive Mush... but if you kill them, at least you know that the other people on the ship are humans).</p><p>And these are the reason you should not kill inactives (if you're human):<br>1) They could still come back to the game. I've seen inactive turning into active on day 2-3.<br>2) If someone dies, everybody gets -1 Morale.<br>3) [Less sure about this] Random bad things can happen to anyone on the ship, inactives included (for exemple, who dies when there is no O2 left)... so having them alive means they could be the one who gets the bad thing and not you.</p>

                <p>I think what the game needs most right now are robust segregation mechanics between froobs and gold members, so that those who paid for the game can get proper value for their money. It'd also be great if inactive players on ships could be replaced by new ones, but I guess that might not be possible due to the nature of the game. However, it seems incredibly obvious that anyone logged as inactive in a game should also receive zero XP and glory until they reactivate. That would offer a little more motivation.</p>

                <p>Yeah, banning them probably won't help much (unless they for some reason keep joining games but still go inactive all the time), but in general the attitude expressed in that post saying "Inactives are there to stay, just deal with it" is completely unsatisfactory. If the devs are okay with making Gold mode totally unattractive, then that is of course their business, but there are plenty of other options, eg those in my post above.</p><p>Even if non-participation won't be punished, it seems like a really basic, common-sense idea that they shouldn't be rewarded for it either. So no glory, and especially no XP. It also seems clear to me that the very LEAST you should get as a gold player is that you won't be put on the same ship with first-timers who immediately quit after finishing the tutorial. For crying out loud, it costs as much as an MMO subscription, that's VERY steep for this kind of game.</p>

                <p>While I'm not into segregations at all, but if inactives are here to stay, then I'll have to reluctantly agree that we need some form of it. I understand we can't ever completely segregate them, as it'll mean non-gold ships will be even worse than it is now.</p><p>What I do propose, however, is allow gold players to SOMETIMES join gold ships. Maybe like a quota system. After playing in normal ships X amount of times (without being inactive, or get reported for killing themselves/griefing), they'll have a chance to jump gold, or something.</p><p>I just want some sort of reward &amp; punishment system of inactivity. Yes, a <em>ban</em> is one of my more extreme...."ideas", but to be fair, at that point I just found out I'm stuck in an inactive ship and was about to miss a Mush jump, because of all the rules in place to stop me from quitting that ship early...thus my emotions were running a bit high, since I felt like I was being punished for being active <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>Anyway, now that I'm calm , I would like to rationally go through this discussion. There are a few types of inactives:</p><p>1. New players who join and immediately decided it's not their thing<br>2. New players who join, but after a few cycles, decided they don't understand it<br>3. Experienced players who join, but decided to be inactive because they didn't like the ship<br>4. Any player who joined with the intention of being active all the way through, but got "distracted" by real life</p><p>I undestand that groups (1) and (4) we can't do anything about. But group (2) can be fixed with tutorial ships or mentor systems, and group (3) can be fixed by penalising inactives and/or rewarding actives.</p><p>Of course, there is the argument that maybe there aren't that many people in group (2) and (3). So, if anyone has some sort of statistical data to look at, it'll be awesome too. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

I can understand having to deal with the challenges posed by a short-handed crew, but for me it's only acceptable in the case that those missing crewmembers were killed in the course of duty, or turned out to be Mush, or what have you. If they simply weren't there to begin with, all that goes out the window. Maybe someone else can find fun in trying to make up for starting the game with less than half a roster, but not me.</p><p>I also see it as a simple question of self-interest on Motion Twin's part. With the game as it is, I don't see why anyone would ever even consider getting more than the minimum one month of gold time. Maybe they're content with that, but if not, they really need to come up with something more to offer, whether it's gold-only games or a different solution. As long as gold players are forced to deal with crews like this, the deal is a non-starter.</p>

                <p>I think you need to have patience until the new players are a little more experienced. It's not just a problem of inactivity, it's mainly that most crew members don't have a clue what's going on. They don't know what to do, they don't know what they're supposed to do (or not to do), let alone what others are supposed to do, they don't understand what's happening or what other people say. Even when a few crew members have some experience, they can't explain everything. They talk about aracks and trax, antispore gas, PILGRED, Xyloph, rebel bases, mankarogs, and even if they try to explain, there's still too much to understand for a first ship. When people have a little more experience, it will get better.</p><p>You're all focusing on inactivity, but it's only part of the problem. There will always be inactive people, but there will be less beginners who don't do their job or do it wrong. When the crews are more experienced, and with better skills, ships will get much better, even with inactives. You can easily return to Sol or even make it to day 10 with only 8 active people.</p>

Yes, in d2n, all beginners go in small map towns. I don't know if you've noticed, but this has contributed to a stagnation of the d2n player base, because small map towns suck. If they were what I thought the game was about when I first tried it back in season 0, I don't think I would have kept playing past my first town or two. In a game with an even steeper learning curve because of the built in distrust of other players, you would see that even worse here I think, if experienced players weren't mixed in with new ones by design.</p><p>I made a suggestion a while back which I think would largely mitigate the problem people are complaining about, which is <a target="_self" href="/tid/forum#!view/104909|thread/32264265">tutorial ships</a>. It was meant as an attempt to make the game more playable for new players who do want to play, by having a guaranteed mentor aboard their first ship, but it would also mean that people who only login once ever would be only on the tutorial ships. If anyone feels like giving feedback on the idea as posted in the link there to hammer it out better, it would be awesome, and you know, maybe more constructive than more complaining without offering solutions. (Not directed at everyone, but I have seen lots of people doing this so far.)</p>

I enjoy that kind of a challenge, and if people are willing to be engaged and ask questions, I'll be happy to help answer them. Not just because it makes that one ship better, but because for every person I help learn the game, then every other ship they join afterward may benefit from that experience. If I only manage to get a few people engaged, then so be it; that's a few people who might have given up on the game because nobody had the experience or the patience to show them the ropes.</p>

Maybe some idealists would apply for it a few times, but I imagine the percentage of quitters on every ship would make it too soul-crushing to continue for long.</cite><p>I'd, too, volunteer. Don't get me wrong, I love me a good ol' fashioned active ship, so you're probably right in the sense I can't do it ALL the time. But, I also like the idea of introducing more players into Mush properly, thus making it bigger and busier. For that, I would do it at least once every other ship. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I find one easy fix is to get to the <em>before</em> they become inactive. If they get as far as "Hello", it means that the game isn't an instant turn off for some of them. They'll likely log on again later, if only just once.</p><p>Strike up a conversation with them at that point. Roleplay a little and encourage them to roleplay. The game mechanics themselves are extremely boring - you get 1 AP and 1 MP every 3 hours and most of the game is actually chatting. It's absurd to punish people using glory or whatever - when you first start playing a game, you look at fun, not at score. What's fun is the emergent gameplay, and the community feel even though each community changes per ship.</p><p>Make friends with them on the spot, so they feel a little guilty about quitting. Most of the game is chatting, so chat with newbies! Encourage them to roleplay a bit. Dig up interesting bits from their bio:<br>"Hey Finola, I'm a great fan of your work. Sorry for the way we dragged you onto the ship, but you're stuck with us now."<br>"You know, we could really use your help developing some Anti Mush serum. Nobody else has your skill with biology."</p><p>"Stephen! I thought I'd never see you again after you dropped me off at Mars. How have you been? What are you up to on the ship?" (as Paola)<br>"Oh! Don't cook anything for the ship yet, it'll go rotten by tomorrow and we need to ration our food supplies. You used to be a mercenary, right? Maybe you could go into one of the turrets and shoot down a few hunters?"</p><p>Or if you want to get straight to the point, just something like "Chun, let's go hunt some mush! You're the only one I trust on this ship!"</p><p>The idea here is to pose a rigged question to a newbie. You want to trick them into committing to something. Once they're committed, they'll log in every now and then, even if it's to apologize later for not having time to play the game. After they log in 5 times, they'll log in more often even without any prodding.</p><p>The other bit is that you want to get them chatting and out of their shell. Mush is a highly communicative game. If they don't like chatting, they won't enjoy the game.</p><br><p>On my first game, I took Jin Su. Was a poor choice for first character, as I later realized. Everyone was asking me for their orders. It was my first time, and most of the people who asked for orders were playing their first time too.</p><p>It got me committing as a leader of some spaceship. By day 2, I found out little things that needed to be done. By day 3, I figured everyone's roles and learned first hand why it's so important to have cameras everywhere.</p><p>It was a poor ship. I mean, hell, no cameras in the dorm.. how noob can anyone get? But by day 3, I was already bossing everyone around. Roland... you fill up the fuel tanks. Frieda, you scan for planets. Eleesha, you waste AP hunting mush. Stephen, you hang around the bridge with the hacker kit in case I need to sleep. Paola, make daily announcements on our status. Janice, keep me comfortable in the dorms. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/bg.gif" alt=":cool:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And then the magic happened. Everyone started enjoying the game, even though they didn't know what to do at first. We went from newbie ship to a point where a quarter of the ship was online every cycle. We had fun banter during our final hours. We had newbies saying "I'll be afk for a cycle", because they realized how important their role was.</p><p>Of course, as mush, all the activity wasn't good for me, so I decided to stab everyone who tried to get oxygen in the end. But it was fun from an OOC perspective.</p>
