                <p>I suspect this has been discussed before, but I'm only a couple months old on the game, so I haven't seen it, and wanted to air my concerns.</p><p>I'm so thrilled for the idea of castings. I've met some cool players in my time here whom I'd love to play with regularly, and I am indeed tired of getting ships full of people who don't even try to speak English, who log in and go braindead instantly, all the usual complaints. I think castings are a great concept, and I'm in no way saying that they shouldn't happen.</p><p>That said: What happens to the newbies when the playerbase migrates to castings? One of my profoundest joys in the game is getting an intelligent, talkative new player who's eager to learn whom I can help puzzle out its mysteries Even when I'm mush, I try to guide new players in the right direction. Twinoid needs a playerbase for revenue, if nothing else! The more people there are who have a good experience of the game, the more people there'll be buying gold subscriptions.</p><p>But when castings come around, it seems likely that new players will much more often be on ships with *only* new players, or at any rate with a much smaller population of experienced players to guide them. Now, for all I know, casting ships aren't exclusive with public ships, but even if you can be on an open ship and a casting ship at the same time, I suspect many players less interested in anyone's fun but their own will be putting a lot more attention into their casting ships than they will their publics. Has anyone had a brilliant idea to address this concern? It'll be terrible for the community and for the company if the influx of new players who get hooked dries up. The best feeling there is in an endgame screen is seeing a first-time player say they had a blast and knowing they're gonna go hop straight into another ship, and without active player guidance, I feel like those farewell messages will drop off sharply.</p><p>Put my mind at ease! Tell me that castings aren't going to mean a huge deficit of shared wisdom for newbies.</p>

                <p>I havent played random ships on the french site, but what i can definetly say is that even if you have hundreds of tickets, you wont be playing castings every time you can, even though it may look fun to play with all Active players and no complete noobs, it isnt. As Phocks said a game without newbs is a dead game, same goes for castings, everyone will expect much more from you, which puts a lot more pressure on you. And it isnt fun to be mush from what i have seen, Phocks can probably say that aswell. And even if you do ban certain research like we did, it wont help that much, and castings wont stay fun if you just do that, you need to mix it up, which means you will play random ships, maybe not everyone, but i suspect most will. At first maybe the experienced people in randoms Count will drop, but im fairly certain it will rice up after a while again, probably 2 or 3 casting ships, so about 1 month or 1.5 months</p>

                <p>I don't think casting ships will be that much of a problem. I think most players that play constantly would get about four games in a month. Each player gets one free casting ticket per month so it would suggest that each player would play one casting ship a month. Of course you get free casting tickets for getting to day 10, so your cast could potentially go infinite and get to go on infinite casting ships, but the cast also needs tickets to unlock the new game modes and of course their cast forum. Also don't forget that mush needs exactly 16 players per ship, so what happens if a cast get 25 players in it and they all can't get to go on the scheduled ships? well the other players will probably play more on the random ships.</p><p>About the ships not being as fun as there are more active players and hence more stress, i don't think that will be a problem either as don't forget that there are going to be other game modes that change up things specifically for these ships, like the one where there is three mush to start rather than just two.</p><p>Personally i can't wait for castings, and although yes there will be less active players on random ships because they are on casting ships occasionally, I think there will probably still be MMM running for newer players that are properly interested in the game. There will probably be castings for new players as well that will accept pretty much anyone. Also, groups of irl friends can join in games together, meaning that word of mouth will be a more powerful source of advertising because they want to play together, because right now mush is pretty much a game you can't play with friends reliably at all.</p><p>This is just my opinion but i don't think that castings will kill the game by making it difficult for new players to get into it (never mind the game already has a steep learning curve). I think that they will just allow more chances for active players to have a more strategically interesting time in one of their monthly ships. Random ships probably won't starve for actives, especially since random ships are probably where most players are going to have their more interesting and random stories.</p>

I was just thinking that yes the mush will have a harder time as there is more crew running around, but it also means that they can blend in more and play the long game much more effectively, as well as the game modes countering the heightened activity of the crew. It was just a though but you might be right. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I just had a thought that maybe MT are trying to work around this by waiting till they have a certain number of active English speaking players before they release castings so when the activity level on random games goes down it doesn't completely kill the ships. might be a while yet if they are. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/crylot.png" alt="T_T" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Casting ships gets no achievements or anything but the number of cycle played on character and do not count on leaderboard, on french mush, I suspect its a reason a lot of people give up very soon after mush die, of course you can find exceptions but its just the overall impression i got, much more chances to reach Eden on a MMM or jump of some kind than in a casting ship as of now.</p>
