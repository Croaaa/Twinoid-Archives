                <p>And I loved playing Gioele! A lot more than I thought I would, actually. All the coffee meant I could take care of whatever needed taking care of and that made me happy panda. ^^ It was really weird to be an active Gioele though, since I'd yet to see one at this point, heh. He really is a blast to play after PILGRED is fixed, provided the player is active enough to collect the coffees regularly.</p><p>All in all a pretty fun ship, even if it did have it's very frustrating moments. The active players were awesome at filling in the gaps, even though there were a lot of them. Hua, I was joking when I gave you the mission to do ALL the things, but you really did do all the things, and pretty well. By the end, really felt like you were someone I could count on to get things done and that was awesome. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>My one regret is that I didn't successfully seduce any of the fine ladies aboard the ship and talk them into enjoying my vast fortune with me, since we've saved humanity now. But I suppose I'll just give it to Paola and her young man.... Provided he's not mush. Will have to interrogate him first, I suppose.</p>

                <p>I'm going to go on a rant real fast.</p><p>I was jin su. I <strong>HATE</strong> playing as mush, I want to be part of the team and help the ship. However I know that mush is part of the game and if I'm mush I should play as mush. Fine so I play the part, I spore try to convert people work towards the goal of a mush. However my mush partner Kuan-Ti did not play the part. He didn't try to work on the mush team, he just sat around doing nothing to help me his fellow mush. Then when I look back at the ship I see Kuan-Ti is now human. Great, I'm so glad to see that I get punished for playing the role that I'm suppose to play while Kuan-Ti does nothing for his real team and in the end gets to be human and share in the victory with the rest of the humans. Why is there a mush cure in this game? All it does it make mush not want to play their own true team. Why should anyone that doesn't want to play as mush help their mush partner when they can just sit around waiting for the cure to pop up and then switch teams?</p>

                <p>Hehe I only started flirting when it was clear we were ending the ship. ^^</p><p>@VP: I can see how it'd be frustrating to have a mush partner who's trying to play the long game. Maybe best course of action in the case of this ship would have been to get the suspicious humans killed, or just lie low and let us kill one another. Could have cost us Raluca and Finola with very little pushing there at the beginning, and maybe Roland as well, without doing more than casting suspicion on yourself if you had been the one to push for it, and not much suspicion at that given their actions. If you had looked human, you probably wouldn't have even had to do anything for Raluca to die, it was a toss up between you and her at the time.</p><p>I know after the fact advice isn't very helpful, but perhaps this is a strategy you'll consider if it comes up in the future, for less frustrating play. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>it does seem pretty obvious in my first ship that many people pick their character with the intention of playing it, contributing to the overall effort and communicating with the entire team, then that is all ripped away when they start as a Mush instead.</p><p>Got a feeling that many Mush players will just AFK, or even "suicide" by making it obvious they are Mush early on to get killed or cured.

                <p>Terrance checking in here, great playing with Giole - Rain you were a good captain. I dont agree with Kuan-ti's strategy at all, it was not the 'long game', you didnt even spore anyone so you were bordering on helping the human team almost. As a Mush you must help the mush team.</p><p>Anyway, good fun playing terrance, with a more active crew it would be great to use his free movement by having people sitting in strategic locaitons around the ship, for example, terrance could be used to move a bunch of items from icarus bay tot he refectory for free if people were in the rooms all along the way. I look forward to playing as him again!</p>

I <strong>HATE</strong> playing as mush, I want to be part of the team and help the ship. However I know that mush is part of the game and if I'm mush I should play as mush. Fine so I play the part, I spore try to convert people work towards the goal of a mush. However my mush partner Kuan-Ti did not play the part. He didn't try to work on the mush team, he just sat around doing nothing to help me his fellow mush. Then when I look back at the ship I see Kuan-Ti is now human. Great, I'm so glad to see that I get punished for playing the role that I'm suppose to play while Kuan-Ti does nothing for his real team and in the end gets to be human and share in the victory with the rest of the humans. Why is there a mush cure in this game? All it does it make mush not want to play their own true team. Why should anyone that doesn't want to play as mush help their mush partner when they can just sit around waiting for the cure to pop up and then switch teams?</p></cite><p>maybe kuan-ti wanted to be human, just fire a complaint.
