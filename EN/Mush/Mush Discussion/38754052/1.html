                <p>I just had a game - I was mush-Raluca with Physicist+Technician. <br>We get PILGRED to a "stopping point" of 60%. Then I waited a bit for ap and another free point, with one reset from mush-partner (would need 2 resets, but one of humans reseted it from 60% to 61%, dunno why) and got it to 100%. Then - transfer to commander and return to Sol, D2C6.<br>My question is - is there a way to stop mush-Raluca to win every game like that?</p><p>Even if you stop PILGRED at 0%, mush-Raluca with partner still can rush it! 2-3 free points. 12ap is around 80% and Raluca can easily make 2 spores just after mush selection to eat later - with 20ap+free points from 0 to 100 is not a problem.</p><p>Not to mention - keeping PILGRED at 0% is dangerous as well - you can just get teches killed by mushes (or better teches+pilots or teches+morale support) and your ship will very likely die too.</p><p>You can hope to guard FC in time - but it will require you to be super-lucky to be active in right time.<br>You can hope to track Raluca's ap, but she can just say "need to go for holidays, will be back in a day-two".<br>You can hope her partner is idle or some of them get caught in a first day...but not all mushes are that bad, especially if they have plan like that.</p>

                <p>The best thing to do is to forbid Raluca from putting anything but her PILGRED points into the engine every two days.

                <p>Gah... I was just in the same game. The thing being, I'm not quite sure how to handle the situation: the only reason we even knew PILGRAD was at 60% was because Raluca told us straight up. Let's be honest, who goes into the Engine room and works on PILGRAD without being asked to by Raluca (Its the perfect tactic for a Mush, after all, since it makes you dirty so often). I agree with the Chun suggestion (our game Eleesha wouldn't have worked... she was the other mush), but that requires Chun being locked down even more then she already is. It also requires Chun to be on at exactly the right time, since the whole game-ending process can be condensed into less then half an hour. And even if she is... what can she do about it? You also have to have enough competent people on at the same time, who can manage to kill a Mush blitzing through the ship to the Commander to transfer into him, and have two people positioned to guard the FC (Since if you don't have two, the Mush partner can just transfer into the one guard). That's not something a human crew can depend on.</p>

But she can return you home on D2-D3 where you cannot say for sure who is idle, who is not, and very few ships make so fast idle-wipe outs. Also she can store ~6ap and then spend 6ap every 6 cycles, she will say - I got 6, I spent 6, and it will be truth. It's unlikely you will be able to count her starting ap.

You can't just say "You can idle for six cycles", Six cycles is most of the day! If Eleesha/Chun/Derek/Chao/Gioele don't check on her during that time to confirm her AP use it is REALLY their fault for not being suspicious enough.</p><p>I would heavily question any Raluca that wasn't spending almost all of her AP in the nexus. Especially during those first few days. If she is taking a bed in a dorm or stealing the medlab bed without permission I'd probably murder her myself.</p>

                <p>ok, so lets say you start on day 1 cycle 1 and don't know if your mush or not until day 1 cycle 6.</p><p>if you have spent some time on pilgred already to use one of the pilgred points, then you would expect pilgred to be at about 11% on mush selection. So on day 1 cycle 6 if you have 12 ap, you have to spend 6ap to extract three spores at once to have what you need. then on day 2 cycle 4 you have 12ap again and 2 pilgred points and three spores. If your partner started relaying you then it would take about 8 more relays on average (which he would have to use some spores to do too namely 1 and be at 12ap) you would end the process with exactly 0ap and 3 spores. You would then have to eat one spore to get the ap to spike the commander and transfer if ian is in the same room and you would still have another spore just in case.</p><p>If done correctly and mush selection is done between cycles 1-3 then you could be back in sol by day 2 cycle 1. You right this seems a bit much for the crew to catch in time. However it does require a silver reluca with transfer and an active 2nd mush.</p>

Problem solved.</p><p>Raluca is intrinsically suspicious in all games and Raluca players who aren't aware of that, well, I suppose they learn after being murdered a few times.</p></cite><p>But in this scenario, she's only not working on Nexus part way into Day 2 at worst (Easy to justify: nobody can really blame you for pre-Mush selections that aren't actively greifing, and after Mush selection you can be AFC a few cycles without anybody really noticing: you had to sleep, or work long: this early in the ship you haven't established a schedule anybody can compare it to). Then, if you or your Mush partner are on at the same time, they can relay you and with a few lucky rolls you're flying to Sol before anybody can get a clear idea what you're doing.</p><p>Also, plenty of people can/do only get on once a day. Later in the game, you'd know when that is, but that early? How would you tell?</p><p>There only seems to be three options I can see.</p><p>1. The Paranoid Option: Keep Raluca on a choke leash, under constant surveillance from Chun or a generalist. Works on PILGRAD more then once a day? Doesn't go to the Nexus during the first few cycles after Mush selection and again every day like clockwork? Lynch her.</p><p>Problems: A. Sending somebody (who's not Chun) into Raluca's turret to even check her skills is usually insta-death for any crew member who does it: after all, if she WASEN'T Alpha, have people check up on her and she certainly runs the risk of becoming it. And if she is, its the perfect oppritunity to infect anybody (again, who isen't Chun)</p><p>B. Sending Chun sucks up the resources of dedicated Research-relayer, which is problematic unless you're fortunate enough to have an active Andie and another dedicated relayer for her.</p><p>C. In all likelihood, you can't afford kill Raluca just for a few missteps: like it or not, it's not possible for the Human's to win without PILGRAD, and unless you're swimming in Techs, you need Raluca to get it at least somewhat high (well into the easy-to-complete range for this combo) in order to have any chance of finishing it before the ship falls apart around your ears.</p><p>2. The Panic Option: If somebody notices this going on in time, scream bloody murder, get the Commander (if he's on) to waste his AP as fast as possible, and get two full-health guards to block FC. If you can manage to pull this off, the Mush have blown their cover, are energy-less and easy to kill, and gave you a complete Pilgrad reactor.</p><p>Problems: A. Your timing has to be very, very lucky and co-ordinate very, very precise. Plus, you have to have 2 people on, near the front of the ship, and with the AP to block (Health is also an issue, since they need to be able to survive, but with the Mush being low-energy that shoulden't be an issue). If that dosen't happen... tough beans.</p><p>B. With cover blown, you're just lost your current commander and (if the second Mush has energy to spare) one of your two guards. You better be ready to lose one of your guards (Jin, likely still the commander unless he's a griefer or quarantined, is usually not a crippling lose)</p><p>C. You now have to kill two full-health Mushes.</p><p>3. The Cheap Option: Force-test Raluca every ship, kill her if she dosen't comply.</p><p>Problem: Against the rules.</p>

I'm not saying Raluca isn't irreplaceable: I'm saying she's much more valuable then, say Jin or Paola and her Pilgrad skills don't transfer down like titles, meaning "making one or two mistakes" (which is the worst it could look like in the scenario described by this thread) with minimal PILGRAD progress wouldn't be worth the Mush suspicion. It's called the Paranoid option for a reason: you're literally not given Raluca the benefit of the doubt for ANYTHING; a standard of proof which you wouldn't put on anybody else.</p><p>Best-case scenario, you have to kill two people. If you have to do the 200 AP burn (Assuming nobody ever burns any AP to move,and nobody does anything else: killing Hunters, working on NERON, Comms work, scanning planets, taking care of the plants, ect., maximum bed efficiency with a Sofa, nobody ever showering), that's 1 1/4 day's worth of AP. And that's not counting the AP needed to kill the Mush, or possible Rampage victims. (Raluca and her partner will have all that AP saved up. One death is virtually guaranteed, and any smart Mush would be targeting the Techs). Assuming by some miracle you have more then 2 Techs on the ship that aren't Mush (rare, in my experience) then yes, it's not deadly. BUT, that's assuming you can even tell the difference between a Raluca who logs in once or twice a day and one working on this plan, which this early on you have no way to tell the difference.</p><p>And that's the best-case scenario: with RNG gods take you to their favor, and everybody is active and extremely efficient and just the right characters being Gold or Silver and not Mush.</p>

With Pilgred at 60% already pre-mush (which I thought was incredible), and Derek being a tunnel-vision do-anything player, I only had to reset once. Thing was, of course, I was almost completely unhelpful and was probably going to get killed by Day 3 Change. Raluca had a tonne of AP/transfer: easy game. Hua was a player who was doing more things than me, but got killed because she didn't announce anything/was new and didn't know what to do as Hua. I got lucky with attention on her. I would have been next on the list, along with Raluca. An active ship notices things like that. Peace.</p>

                <p>Well, in my experience having an inactive Mush is rare, and "competent" in this case is a little different. They don't need to be able to plan or operate independently, maintain a guise for any extended period of time, or even be anything more then Bronze: they just have to listen to everything you say. As for noticing a lack of activity, if this strategy didn't go so quickly I would agree with you: but, on day 2, when there are no other leads to go off of, does one day of less-then-stellar activity really scream Mush?</p>

                <p>In my experience the mush had inactive partner in more than a half of my ships. Competent partner is really important, since they can mess up the plan by doing something stupid, for example extracting a spore under a camera.. etc,etc.</p><p>By the way, not only Raluca is a problem, a lot of mushes also rampage on Day 2 after doing nothing &amp; accumulating full bar of AP, so I think it's a good idea to find them ASAP before they started to kill people.</p><p>I think the best way to find them on active ships is to print the list on Day 2 and start investigating\testing people, find one of the alpha mushes and rush Pheromodem to see the names of awoken mushes.</p>

                <p>The beauty of the Pheromodem is that it compensates you for such tactics:<br>If only one Mush goes on an early suicidal rampage, his partner will be bummed if you rush Pheromodem thanks to the body. If both do it, at least the survivors will not have to worry about Mush anymore, and can go research crew boosts rather than anti-Mush stuff.<br>So if the Mush don't have weapons, whatever they can do is often not <em>that</em> bad in exchange.</p><p>When you are returned to Sol, however, that won't help. That is why this is different.</p>

                <p>I'm having Deja Vu here.... <br><a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4383" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/4383</a><br>Again I'm choosen as Raluca as a mush. Again I have Eleesha-mush to help me. She said she plays on mush side for first-time and she was bronze. And all 16 players were active. So I did not want to spore people - I was afraid she will be easily got caught. So I told her a plan to get PILGRED working+transfer and she full supported me.</p><p>Using advices here, I tried to stay our of suspection of the human team:<br>- I helped a lot in the nexus - I got plasma shield myself with just 4 resets and helped with other projects as well.<br>- People did not know about my ap - I used all 4 spores on D2 (when mush were choosen) for ap - we did't need them to spores, and nobody was expecting me to have +8ap.<br>- I worked on PILGRED just on free points - 20% on D1 by free points. 40% after one reset on D2 - 1 free point+2ap. From 40% I easily got it to 100% with Eleesha's help on D3C1.</p><p>So really what's the way to stop that except super-ap-counting or to guard FC all the time? I cannot see any good protection from that tactics...I will probably do it again...and maybe again few times until anyone finds the way to stop that.</p>

I just want to play one game as human-Raluca, so I pick her again and again... but RNG thinks different.<br><cite> and do you also intend to play always the same mushy tactic as soon as you are mush?</cite><br>First of all, I'm trying to get one thing with trying to do that again - if that tactics is so op, that people on random ships have no hope to win (so maybe something should be rebalanced here? Like limit of PILGRED repairs per cycle or day) or they just are not smart enough to counter that properly. I hoped the thread will give some counter-tactics...but it gave only few tips for mush Raluca to get victory without getting suspecious.</p><p>And actually the best thing while playing mush for me is to win humans. Way does not matter. So more efficient are better. Just to know - they had 14 players, you had just 2. They were hoping to get research, projects, maybe planets and Eden, all kind of stuff and you just crush their dreams - maybe leaving the ship in agony with half of team dead, maybe making them WTF WHY WE ALREADY ON SOL?! Oh, those last word messages....priceless.</p>

                <p>You might consider editing the topic title if you were looking for different suggestions, as right now it seems to just ask in general for how to play as a Raluca mush, and this is a favored strategy. "How to stop a Pilgred Rush?" might be a good choice, since you don't want to use it if it's an unfair tactic. As for how <em>I</em> would play mush Raluca, I think I would prefer to trap Pilgred for resets, especially if you have a technician, and then take anonymush and go for an infiltration victory. This requires at least a silver player, though.</p>

                <p>The question is just: Is it such a big problem for ships - do nowadays every ship with a Raluca as mush loose? And do all mushy Ralucas always go for that tactic on a normal ship? Do mushes nowadays always win? couldn't it be that Raluca is more like a key member which is nice to convert in 7/8 ships where mushes are not Raluca? <br>What does matter more? - the 1/8 ships where mushes have an easy time to win if played right and if it is a normal ship or the 7/8 ships where mushes have a harder time to win but with the existence of Raluca more hope and not only rampage or sabotage as option?</p>
