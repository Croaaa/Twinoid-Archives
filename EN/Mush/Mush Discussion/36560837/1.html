                <p>In this current iteration of the game aside from a few random number generator factors (missing a hunter, failing a repair, failing a fire extinguishing, gaining a logistics proc, rolling high or low on a research/Neron %) a game where all humans and mush spawn at D1C1 and with enough cameras covering the most heavily trafficked areas (Lab, both Dorms, bridge and medlaab) can be solved as an accounting problem by D4C2 given enough communication between humans and enforced communication in the favorited threads.</p><p>All you need are snitches in both dorms (and particularly the dorm with the shower), a good eleesha, and nobody eating food they can't trust.</p><p>Any strategy where the mush attempt to do things that take away from their general AP pool to invest in mushy actions will be found out with a dedicated enough number cruncher. (the last mush in my game was cured before she ever had a chance to rampage because it was discovered that she had only invested 12-14 AP into helping out on the ship after 32 cycles of play (D4C2). Now, not every mush is going to be that sloppy, but it just proves that you can't fudge the numbers if everyone is talking to each other and Constipaspore has been researched. It's just like an IRS tax audit.</p><p>That's why if I ever get selected as mush who only has the opportunity to lie about the whereabouts of 4-10 AP (Raluca, Finola, Designer Kuan Ti etc). Then I'd arrange an all out 12 AP suicidal assault with my partner too. ESPECIALLY on the people in the ship who are directing and probably investigating to kill me. If they create useful threads and inform new players on how they should or should not play to avoid suspicion, then I'd make sure that all that was left on the sinking ship were inactives and suspicious/ kill-impulsive noobs. There's no reason not to if you think about it (in the current iteration), if the investigators run their fine toothed comb through project/research/pilgred threads you WILL get caught spending 6 AP on spore extraction + soapless shower, it's just a matter of when.</p><p>Nothing is unreasonable (ingame) for mush if it hurts the human team, every dirty trick in the book is fair game. Whether that means you want to -try- the social engineering deceit + conversion route or if you want to airlock yourself with Pasiphae with all the extinguishers + sample when Terrence doesn't have Robotics expert and Paola is an active griefer/noob who will never update comms.</p>

                <p>I personally consider mush blitz out the gate to be terribly boring, be I mush or human. However, it's certainly a legitimate tactic that I'm not going to be sore about. It's an effective way to get glory as a mush, if glory's your thing. Different players, different goals.</p><p>Semi-Random sidenote: Just finished a ship where alpha mush blitzed very effectively first day change after ship fill. I was human, and I will say, it was a blast coordinating the remaining 4 survivors to come back from the brink of suicide, finish PILGRED and get to Sol. Immensely satisfying. The suspense of whether or not we'd make it was great, and I made a new friend in one of the survivors. So.... different goals, that change with the game. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8061950 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8061950">MechanisMs</span></span><cite>...</cite><p>The kind of full blown investigation you're talking about takes a level of communication that, in my experience anyways, isn't usually present on the average ship, as in enough people actually being willing to report AP usage so explicitly...

Just need three things that I see in EVERY single ship I've ever played in: Neron project progress thread, Research progress thread and Pilgred progress thread. (oh, and I suppose a verification that no players are on their very first ship who would get the free AP booster shot (pick up hidden walkie, ghost wrench in corridor))</p><p>After that you just need the <strong>Ace card</strong>, a Pilot channel where snitching (i mean reporting!) of hunter/asteroids counts and scrap runs are coordinated for the sake of preventing AP wastage (two pilots fly out without talking to shoot the same 2 hunters at cycle start).</p><p>With those weapons in hand (make sure to favorite every thread that documents progress) it literally only took 5 minutes of basic arithmetic to catch out our Raluca. FIVE MINUTES. Is there already a tutorial on basic forensic AP accounting for mush investigation because maybe I need to make one to set a fire under MT's butt to make more things that can help mask one's AP count in a ship that talks.</p>

                <p>It's a legitimate tactic, but I feel that it simply takes away some of the core concept of the game, which is subterfuge PvP - what you're doing essentially is just make the PvE harder.

Probably, but research isn't necessary for the humans to win. And they just got rid of a mush in exchange.

While annoying, it's unlikely to have much effect on whether the humans can win or not. It will mostly hurt ships in the long term (when the mush are probably dead anyway). As mush I play to win.

                <p>Wait, what is done when a mush is recognized? Everyone on the ship who can tends to dogpile killing them until they're dead, right? Often, if the mush thought their behavior wouldn't get them caught, that mush is dead before that mush even knows they are in immediate danger of being killed.</p><p>Every action a mush takes could get them caught, especially the mushy actions. Heck -often times humans kill humans for appearing to be mushy, or believing that the actions done were mushy-.</p><p>If humans are killing <em>humans</em> for mushy-ish stuff, what hope do mush have of being mushy?</p><p>On my last ship, the poor mush team only made one spore. They could have made more, it was possible.... but we caught the first caught mush *because* he trapped a room, and trying hard and careful use of mycoscanner and roomlog checking showed that the spore had to come from him. Sure, he'd been mushy before that proof.</p><p>His partner was in part caught because of interactive behavior between them, spore opportunies Mush1 had on her, and that she reported 0 spores when she claimed to scan... as well as a few other behaviors of her own that were mushy.</p><p>The deck is stacked against mush who try to act like humans, or act like converters, in many ways. It's very much possible to do a stealth win or a partial stealth win, but both sides are playing for keeps and the human side does not, as a rule, let anything slide.</p><p>Humans who catch mush 'don't give mush chances', nor should they. Why should we say that mush should give humans chances?</p><p>The best way to not get caught by humans hunting for sneaky mush is not to be a sneaky mush. If this 'ruins the humans' hunt for sneaky mush... ahem. Oh well? I enjoy that hunt too, but I enjoy almost every part of the game. This is an arms race, and both sides are well armed. Just need the chance to figure out what your options are.</p><p>Mush never have more power than they do at the start of a ship, before research is completed. Why wait unless you as mush want to? Take the ship, take the ship early, fast, savage, effectively; stop research, control resources, have your drag out fight using every tool you can get and every trick you can think of, at a moment of your choosing; why wait unless you yourself in your specific situation see reason to wait?</p>

                <p>I have a bit of a different perspective on this. Personally, I love the Mush Hunt. Additionally, my very first game saw an Alpha Mush blitz that rid our ship of the Pasiphae and a few other choice items very early on.</p><p>That ship went back to Sol after Day 10 and gave me my highest glory rating.</p><p>In contrast, I've been an Alpha Mush twice. Both times, I played the long con and tried to stay under the radar. Both times I succeeded.</p><p>Does inactivity on a ship help? Of course. As does the fact that people tend to make mistakes, fail to communicate effectively, and suffer from the general hazards of space/RNG.</p><p>It might be the case that my stealth play would be unviable on a fully active MMM ship, particularly since I'm a bronze player.</p><p>However, I had an excellent game as Kuan Ti where I successfully created my own Mush Hunting channel and got the ship sidetracked into attacking a harmless human Ian. I was effective because I played my game essentially straight, and made sure to be careful to mask my spore extraction with helpful dirty-inducing ship behaviors: item repair/pilgred relay/etc.</p><p>My second game I was the lone mush as my fellow alpha mushroom was braindead. That game I was a bit more lazy, as the odds were stacked against me. However, I successfully survived under the radar as the RNG took its toll on the ship. I was helped by the fact that we had a bunch of inactive players-but personally, I think inactive players are a key part of the game. Without them, succeeding as Mush is exponentially tougher-while a ship can be run decently with a skeleton crew that's active.</p><p>In short, while I might not survive a Mush Accountant Experience, I have yet to run across a player with such expertise, while the game has a lot of in-built shelters and distractions to keep players from being able to conduct such close accounting.</p><p>(Example: I was on a ship where nobody noticed that a fellow mush had dismantled the camera in Alpha Dorm-to the point that the log was fully buried after a day and nobody said a peep. This was with active and experienced players who were in Alpha Dorm and active for a number of cycles while the log was in play/camera was gone.)</p>

                <p>yes, of course, I would always recommend the way of the mush were he is sneakily trying to convert people and get new mushes until the mushes have enough power to rule the ship. It makes fun and it is a fair challenge of humans vs mushes on most ships.</p><p>But if you have the luck (or as mush probably more likely the bad luck) to be on a ship full of active people it would probably not work, especially if they rush research like the combination of antispore gas and contiaspore serum on day 1.. <br>Then there are not much possibilities left to win.<br>Then it could be necessary to use tactics like an incredible effective sabotage from where the humans can't recover and would most likely lead to the doom of the ship (or an early return to sol ^^).</p><p>The only way to win a long term win on such a ship I can think of is that: You need one absolutely inconspicuous conversion, the only necessary conversion. And additionally it would only be successful in these ships, if you are able to make the humans sure, that they are mush - free after they killed the alpha mushes...<br>It needs a great plan, a great mush partner, good knowings of game mechanics, mushes who are willing to sacrifice themselves for the plan and really much luck, especially when there is a very quick anti-mush reserach and room restrictions. Your preparations can fail, also it can still be possible that despite you managed to get one betamush without any suspicion that there will be a point in the journey where he should normally get an illness or eat more food to finish that or that task. But it is possible that it can succceed, especially since after the humans are thinking that the mushes are gone, there are probably no precautions anymore.... . If I have the opportunity again to be mush on a MMM ship, maybe I will try it if I have a great partnr again <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> ( and if the humans don't give us the opportunity to use an easier method with much less risks ^^).</p>

                <p>The day I actually see a ship discussing if it's fair or not to blitz anti-mush research in the early game is the day I will question whether it's right for me to go berserk early.</p><p>Two sides of the same coin people. If you want mush to give you a chance you have to give them one. The idea that mush should have to "Play nice" for you, because you want to get to day 20 is absolute horse poo.</p><p>You think mush aren't being nice enough to you? This game isn't about the human players. It's about ALL of the players. You might think it's expected for mush to die and let you keep playing. Or that it's expected for mush to be timid and sneaky letting 14 people utilize a dozen different ways to detect them........ But the truth is being mush can be DIFFICULT, and them going ape-butt on you when it seems like a good idea is just part of this game.</p>

                <p>Giving an "uplifting speech" with a grenade as a Jin-su mush lifted most of the spirits of my crew (right out of their bodies), and ended that ship with a bang.

But normally if you have turned more than half the crew you try to kill/turn the humans as fast as possible and try ton finish PILGRED, to go to Sol if Eden isn't within reach, or you could try to get to Eden if the ship is still good. I would prefer to go to Sol instead of blowing up as a Mush (it gives more Glory), and if possible kill as many Humans as possible, the prio is Chun <strong>FOR SURE</strong>! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Alright, so I'm gonna answer the original post without reading the other pages, sorry if you're on a tangent, but I believe it's not a fair tactic.</p><p>The main reasons for that are:<br>It's technically suicide, and therefore against the rules<br>There is no way of countering it. If you hadn't come back on the ship, they would have never gotten everything you took into space back to the ship. Like they can make the choice of keeping you in space until you die of boredom or out of extreme luch they get the magnetic net, but they have absolutely nothing else they can do about it. <br>Then you add the fact that it's really boring to wait in a patrol ship to die.</p><br><p>I have won every ship I have been on as a Mush by day 5 or so and I was in the top 3 of the leaderboard with absolutely no one suspecting me as a mush until the end so really, it's not impossible to win even if you don't use the bullshit tactics.</p>

                <p>However, your only choice, once you leap into that fighter or Scrapship - isn't to just wait to die. You can also wait to get AP and moves built up, the day to change so you have spores again. Sure, humans could move the ship and remove you from play at any moment - that's what carrying those 3 precious items and being in a precious ship is about - these important things that would be lost are your hostages as a reason to not just move the ship and 'be done with'. Humans can still choose to do so; even just one human can make the choice for everyone. But taking off with stuff doesn't need to be suicide, it's one of a great many possible strategies and it does offer certain advantages.</p><p>Although, if you're interested in 'playing it out' and building up resources to repeatedly land and 'do more stuff' to the ship and its living humans, I've come to think you'd probably better communicate enough to make it clear that you intend to land, and humans 'could' catch you then... so your ship's humans are not left without at least a clue that they do have a choice other than magnetic net to maybe get their stuff back - that might make not moving a more tempting offer.</p><p>Of course, it's not easy to catch someone who can land at any moment and do whatever they have AP and access to do, but someone can guard a room, the ship can prepare for the mush's return however people see fit; or humans can accept the sacrifice of the stuff and the ship. I don't even see that as suicide - it's not subtle, but it's not throwing your life away, and it forces a significant cost, especially to move the ship - the goal's to live in safety until you can come back aboard and be a very active, interesting mush with more AP, moves, and spores.</p><p>Doesn't sound boring to me, at least.</p><p>As far as reporting someone for suicide who does this - if you feel that something might be rule breaking, report it. There is nothing wrong with asking the judges to check possibly (or definately) rule breaking behavior. If the judges check it out and decide it was wrong to do, great, you've helped prevent future problems. If the judges thing it was alright to do, but understandable why a player would report it as possible bad behavior, nothing's going to happen to either you or the person you reported.</p><p>It's only if you report someone and the judges feel that the report is clearly a waste of time, that a reasonable person really couldn't find the reported behavior questionable, that you are going to face a sanction yourself for 'report abuse'.</p>

                <p>So, let me get this straight here. And, Impet, yes, I'm paraphrasing you because damn your words were good.</p><p>The Mush came at the humans with every tactic in their disposal because the humans were coming at them with every (fair) tactic in their disposal, and the humans are mad that they lost?</p><p>Let me put this in perspective: Loss of an Apron is not crippling. It does not turn a day 20 ship into a day 10 ship. Loss of a Mush sample is not crippling. Hell, loss of a commander Jin Su is not crippling (Even though I love you Jin Su and you are my favorite forever and always). Here's what kills a ship.</p><p><strong><em>Hesitation.</em></strong></p><p>Speaking as a Mush who used legitimate tactics and got a ton of flak for it by my fellow crew members, almost EVERY tactic the Mush have in their disposal is totally fair. The Humans have NO right to call 'UNFAIR UNFAIR MOMMY HE TOOK MY APRON' when literally EVERYTHING is slanted towards them. Mush get no food AP. Mush have to deal with potentially five cameras. Mush have to deal with five more mycoalarms. Mush have to deal with a spore limit of 2 per day, and it takes 8 AP just to extract those two spores. This is what happens on a ship that actually gets stuff done, and you WILL get a ship that gets stuff done.</p><p>I'm not saying I would ever endorse such a tactic, because it doesn't seem as fun. But what really kills a ship that has a griefer or a Mush take Pasiphae, apron, mush sample, and whatever else is not them taking those items.</p><p><strong><em>It is the act of hesitation.</em></strong></p><p>Saying 'Oh, it's not fair, it's report worthy, it's practically suicide' is also bullshit. You're whining and you're looking for an excuse to get out of a tactic you don't have the stones to get out yourself. Saying 'It hurts the Mush team, it's playing against your team' is another layer of bull, because speaking as a Mush who has had at least two ships of experience with a braindead partner, it doesn't hurt that bad, and in many cases it gives you a little bit more wiggle room because you don't have to worry about heroic sacrifices or any of that. They already went and did it for you. And while the entire crew is distracted by 'ooh, pretty pasiphae in sky', that gives an intelligent Mush lots of room to work with, and plenty of time to do whatever they need to do.</p>

                <p>If a human does it, report it as a clear act of griefing, and we'll gladly throw the book at them for it.

Not one, no exceptions.</p><p>If a Mush does it...yes, it's a boring way to try to win, and yes, it can make things more difficult for their Mush partners (if it's not already part of the plan.) However, <strong>it is a valid Mush tactic</strong>. One can try to argue that it's a form of suicide, but a "suicide" that specifically furthers their team's cause isn't going to earn a sanction; it's only worth reporting it if a human player does it.</p><p>That does <strong>not</strong> mean it should be a <em>preferred</em> tactic, or that the SDF encourages its use. There's just no finesse to it, which is why I prefer to avoid it when I'm Mush.</p>

                <p><cite>So, let me get this straight here. And, Impet, yes, I'm paraphrasing you because damn your words were good.<br><br>The Mush came at the humans with every tactic in their disposal because the humans were coming at them with every (fair) tactic in their disposal, and the humans are mad that they lost?<br><br>Let me put this in perspective: Loss of an Apron is not crippling. It does not turn a day 20 ship into a day 10 ship. Loss of a Mush sample is not crippling. Hell, loss of a commander Jin Su is not crippling (Even though I love you Jin Su and you are my favorite forever and always). Here's what kills a ship.</cite></p><p>Well the fact that it's not crippling furthers the point that it is not a legitimate strategy since it doesn't actually do anything.</p><p><strong><em>Hesitation.</em></strong></p><p><cite>Speaking as a Mush who used legitimate tactics and got a ton of flak for it by my fellow crew members, almost EVERY tactic the Mush have in their disposal is totally fair. The Humans have NO right to call 'UNFAIR UNFAIR MOMMY HE TOOK MY APRON' when literally EVERYTHING is slanted towards them. Mush get no food AP. Mush have to deal with potentially five cameras. Mush have to deal with five more mycoalarms. Mush have to deal with a spore limit of 2 per day, and it takes 8 AP just to extract those two spores. This is what happens on a ship that actually gets stuff done, and you WILL get a ship that gets stuff done.<br><br>I'm not saying I would ever endorse such a tactic, because it doesn't seem as fun. But what really kills a ship that has a griefer or a Mush take Pasiphae, apron, mush sample, and whatever else is not them taking those items.</cite><br>You know the mush has other ways of winning than converting people. You can extirpate one spore a day and plant it on someone to get some allies, but that's not the way to win (unless you have fertile) and so the research is not crippling in any way, just disadvantageous.</p><p><cite><strong><em>It is the act of hesitation.</em></strong><br><br>Saying 'Oh, it's not fair, it's report worthy, it's practically suicide' is also bullshit. You're whining and you're looking for an excuse to get out of a tactic you don't have the stones to get out yourself. Saying 'It hurts the Mush team, it's playing against your team' is another layer of bull, because speaking as a Mush who has had at least two ships of experience with a braindead partner, it doesn't hurt that bad, and in many cases it gives you a little bit more wiggle room because you don't have to worry about heroic sacrifices or any of that. They already went and did it for you. And while the entire crew is distracted by 'ooh, pretty pasiphae in sky', that gives an intelligent Mush lots of room to work with, and plenty of time to do whatever they need to do.</cite></p><p>Or it makes everyone hell bent on finding the last mush simply because they can't research their little protections, as it <strong>always</strong> does</p>

                <p>One ship, it was only after I joined and was alpha mush, I realised at day 4? I would be offline for 36 hours (I could have logged in via android tablet over mobile internet.... but that is not a pleasant experience). So, I talked out things with my mush partner and we came to a plan. My part in this was to cause as much havoc and destruction as possible and this lead to my death.... but the ap used by the humans, helped my mush partner enact a plan to return to Sol.</p><p>I know I have done the run off in pasiphae, when I was a solo mush after the killing of my alpha partner (it wasn't her fault the fuel tank broke when she was there.... one of those random things) and I forgot to check the corridor was clear before doing mushy stuff.. It wasn't very satisfying as it took 3 cycles for the hunters to destroy it. I have made mistakes.... I still make mistakes, but am hopefully not making the same ones.</p>

                <p>It IS a simple problem, it's not complicated. The Mush are supposed to win on a ship by any means necessary, and they are supposed to have every tool in their arsenal in order to do it. I see VERY few ways that the Mush could attempt to win that would actually be unfair, and it would require VERY elaborate planning. Mush don't use exploits because there's almost none that they can use, it's the humans that keep planning mush tests and all this other stuff. When you come up with ideas like that, is it really so surprising we'll come up with ideas like this?</p>

                <p>Mmmm. If you all will forgive the controversial subjects I'm about to mention here, I'd like to disagree with calling this a 'simple problem'.</p><p>This is actually as complicated and, on a human interaction level, as serious a level as the debates about abortion, drug legalization, the death penalty, the existence of god (and which god), slavery, racism.</p><p>Note I do not say it's as serious as the <em>issue</em> of these things - it's as serious as the <strong>debates</strong> about those issues.</p><p>Wherever you have an issue that people care deeply about (and many of us are very interested and involved in mush, thus caring rather deeply about various things about it), and whenever there are two or more 'strong and reasonable perspectives', then lines form.</p><p>Most people find they fall more or less strongly into one perspective or the other; the other side's values and reasons are not especially convincing, sensible, important, or properly thought through - but this is perceived on both sides of the issue, each about the other.</p><p>It takes a lot of work to even really understand how and why an intelligent and reasonable human being could believe in the other side of the debate; it can even lead to a great sense of distrust and scorn of those on the other side, because clearly there's a problem with their values or intellect.</p><p>Except that is not true. We're humans and without training and purposeful effort to stop, we -do- stuff like this to each other, because this is something that humans do. And it's kind of destructive and bad (and can become extremely so), and it doesn't help to understand <em>or</em> convince the other side.</p><p>Issues like this are both simple, seen from one perspective, and complex when seen from multiple sides. And I think trying to work things like this out in games, where it 'doesn't matter' and 'no one can get hurt' is fantastic training and practice for trying to do so in the much more potentially dangerous real life disciplines. After all, the worst that can happen if both sides fail to communicate here is that people get upset, possibly enough to quit the game. In the real world, the worst in the more extreme cases has often resulted in violence to persons and property.</p><p>But this situation <em>is</em> a debate, it is a discussion. The people who feel either side is clearly right and the other clearly wrong, ideally we talk to each other, we explain our views in as easy to understand ways as possible and listen to the other sides' explanation, and then you ask questions and provide a way to understand the conflict you see, if what the other side says doesn't seem to be including all the relevant factors or is wrong for some other reason.</p><p>Even if one side is clearly, logically wrong, it might be clearly, emotionally right from a set of emotional values, especially for those who feel that way. Stuff like this is especially not simple, and calling it simple probably doesn't do anything to make it simpler.</p>

                <p>No, it is simple. It may have emotional significance, but it's still simple.</p><p>Also, unlike the other debates, this one has a referee (well, the God debate may have a referee also, but that's off-topic.) MT and by proxy, the SDF, decides what is fair. This is because it's MT that decides how they want to the game to be. You can disagree all you want, but it's their game.</p><p>Same with how the NHL decides how their Hockey will be played, or MLB decides on Baseball. Sure you can debate it all you want, but ultimately it still comes down to what they decide.</p><p>You may not like that in the bottom of the ninth inning with the bases loaded and a tie-game with a 3-0 count, that the batter doesn't swing at anything and gets a walk for a win. But that's the game. You may prefer that they try to swing for the fences, but they didn't. Those are the rules. Agree or not, it's the rules. Debating with other players won't change anything, and is really just a waste of time.</p><p>It's really that simple. Whether you like it or not is something you have to deal with.</p>

And it's a game <strong>DAMN IT!</strong> Don't whine about what the Mush <strong>DO</strong>, you should rather complain about what the mush <strong>CAN</strong> do.

It may have emotional significance, but it's still simple.</p><p>Also, unlike the other debates, this one has a referee (well, the God debate may have a referee also, but that's off-topic.) MT and by proxy, the SDF, decides what is fair. This is because it's MT that decides how they want to the game to be. You can disagree all you want, but it's their game.</p><p>Same with how the NHL decides how their Hockey will be played, or MLB decides on Baseball. Sure you can debate it all you want, but ultimately it still comes down to what they decide.</p><p>You may not like that in the bottom of the ninth inning with the bases loaded and a tie-game with a 3-0 count, that the batter doesn't swing at anything and gets a walk for a win. But that's the game. You may prefer that they try to swing for the fences, but they didn't. Those are the rules. Agree or not, it's the rules. Debating with other players won't change anything, and is really just a waste of time.</p><p>It's really that simple. Whether you like it or not is something you have to deal with.</p></cite><br><p>Again, I disagree. Because in this case, it's not about a player breaking a rule - like lets say a mush asking to be cured.</p><p>Even for players who feel that mush should ask to be cured; this is a simple issue because it is directly and specifically against the rules; players who do so are systematically identified and sanctioned, and I suppose if they refuse to stop, eventually removed entirely from the game.</p><p>This is not unlike real life, where people who disagree with a law and regularly break it usually end up sanctioned and punished, and in the most extreme cases, utterly prevented from breaking that law again for a very long time.</p><p>What makes this different is that both sides are staying inside the law, as it were. It's not about doing something forbidden, the side that says that some mush tactics should never be done is saying that something is legal that shouldn't be. They are calling for players to willingly abide by a set of standards/rules that is more restrictive than what the 'law' allows - and this is not against the law. Thus there is debate, because it's not just one player who feels this way; there's quite a few of them.</p><p>And trying to say 'there is no debate' is a very, very poor tactic to convince anyone.</p><p>To those on the 'mush can do no wrong unless it breaks the rules' side of things - what do you lose, risk, or suffer if there is an open and respectful discussion about this? Do you feel that your side is so weak, so secretly actually wrong, that open and real discussion about both sides could possibly do anything to harm the side you believe in?</p><p>*scoffs*. I'm on the 'mush can do no wrong unless it breaks the rules' side, personally. And I say, lets debate this, because not everyone agrees, and the only way to have a chance to fix that is for the two sides to openly and calmly talk with each other - and listen. I want to hear why the other side feels what they feel, I want to know their ideas, concerns, arguments, and I want to see if maybe they -are right-. They are welcome to convince me, and if I cannot be convinced by their statements, I can show them why it doesn't convince me - and that gives them a chance to reconsider their ideas, and either help me understand again, or possibly consider themselves if there might be something to the side I present, and maybe they should reconsider part or even all of their ideas.</p>

The problem is I don't think this was an intended mechanic. It seems to me like the admins are treating it like a "Happy accident" and I don't feel that's in the best interest of the game.</p><p>I really feel like it makes the game less fun for everyone involved. There's simply no reliable counter to it so there's no way to prevent it happening, yet it completely changes the tone of the ship and how it plays.</p><p><strong>To those that say "Oh you're just a crybaby! Look a the lil crybaby!"</strong></p><p>Please stop being so short sighted and simple minded. I have absolutely zero problems with mush winning. I think they should get a lot more buffs than they currently have. Mush are definitely underpowered on a good ship. (And overpowered on a really terrible ship) I really would love to see some balancing done that strengthens the mush via activity levels or something. This has already been done with castings in a way. Castings are always high activity so you can do things like use 3 starting mush to give the mush a more fair chance.</p><p>The problem is while the admins have said this tactic is "Fair play" It's not. Not really. I'll use the sports analogy because I think it fits. <strong>Sometimes there are bad calls that hurt the game</strong></p><p>I agree that mush need every advantage they can get. But this one is super lame for everyone involved.</p><p>For proof that I'm not just "A Human whiner" I was on a ship recently that was trying to blitz anti-mush research before the ship was full. I pleaded with them to slow down and I encouraged neutral play until the mush were chosen. I explained how it's unfair for the mush to be played against before they are even chosen. I was called a mush sympathizer among other things. Eventually the mush were chosen and things were fine. No mush research was finished before they spawned. I was pretty happy to start out in decent conditions with the mush having a fair(er) chance. Then the mush immediately took some items, jumped into the pasiphae, and committed suicide via hunters on day one.</p><p>It's kinda bull.</p><p><strong>To those that say "The SDF say it's fair play so everyone has to shut up!"</strong></p><p>No? I mean if they tell us we can't discuss it anymore that's one thing. However It is a pretty terrible tactic that should be patched out or at least have a counter patched in. I'll probably yammer against it so long as it's allowed and I'm allowed to. At the very best I might make enough of a fuss to get something fixed. At the worst the admins will say the topic is closed for discussion and I'll drop it.</p>

Doesn't matter, and debating won't really accomplish anything.</p><p>With that said, if something is new, then it should be talked about so that people are aware of it, but we're not going to make rules that people will follow without resorting to sanctions. If someone does research before MUSH are selected, what can you do to stop them? Kill them? Then you'll be sanctioned. Talk about it, sure, but if nothing is being accomplished, move on.</p>

                <p><cite>I was pretty happy to start out in decent conditions with the mush having a fair(er) chance. Then the mush immediately took some items, jumped into the pasiphae, and committed suicide via hunters on day one.</cite><br>While I can understand your disappointment at them not using the fair chance you fought for, again, what is the ingame problem with that?<br>They <strong>failed</strong> at their mission by doing that. Because with a confirmed all human crew and no Mush research to worry about, it should be easy to get a Sol return with the Serum. It may not be as exciting for some players as hunting Mush, but you win.</p><p>Now there is another tactic I do not like to spread here which can be considered broken, as it basically only needs one stealthy conversion and some activity to guarantee a Mush win (the one which would have doomed my MMM3 ship on Day 3 if that first convertee had not raged and ratted everyone out).<br><em>That</em> should be fixed as it is basically an exploit. But I will forward that to the SDF rather than complaining here.</p>

                <p>As the OP, I wanted to potentially add to the complexity of my initial query.</p><p>I would consider my approach to leaving in the Pasiphae to be an opening move, somewhat akin to a Queens gambit in chess. My strategy in this instance given I had shooter points and full AP was to kill two crew members (I was lucky with my shots), and take the critical items into the Pasiphae. After around 6-7 cycles hunters appeared and the Pasiphae was going to be destroyed, so I landed. I was able to spore the Eleesha who was ready and waiting for me, hide the Mush sample and apron in a different room, sabotage equipment, and then Transfer into Eleesha.</p><p>At this point Eleesha (or anyone they have waiting for you in the Alpha bay) probably has full AP, whereas your original Jin Su body is on 0 AP / MP. Ideally they would kill your Jin Su body before the original player reacts, but even without that your in a position to do a lot of damage and potentially kill 3-6 players solo, as well as draining a full bar of AP / MP from a player waiting to kill you.</p><p>I don't think I would use this every time, but (in agreement with your Mush partner), I think it can make for an interesting opening to a ship.</p><p>I don't consider blindly taking off in the Pasiphae with the intention to die and not play Mush to be a valid approach to the game. Rather if based on activity, your mush partner, the position of items and characters on the ship etc, it could be an alternate approach to winning as Mush.</p>

It might not be your style, but validity in all these scenarios isn't an issue.</p><p>If a Mush takes off with the Pasiphae, that's like unexpectedly losing an important character like Janice on an expedition and there's no shrink mage book to make up for the lack of a shrink. You deal with it and part of the challenge is too see how far you can get under those circumstances.</p>
