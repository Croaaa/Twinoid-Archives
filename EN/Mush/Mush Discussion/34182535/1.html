                <p>How do you guys and girls feel about sharing your journey on the Daedalus with foreign (<em>English as second language</em>) players? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I have encountered this on numerous occasions whether it be French or Spanish speaking players. Sometimes they will <em>say they are playing to brush up on their English</em>, others (particularly spanish) have <em>said their version of MUSH is even more plagued by inactives</em> and that is why they come to the English side. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/exclaim.png" alt=":!:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Sometimes I just get a hunch based on the <em>poor communication skills of certain players or broken English</em> in the chat that English might not be their primary language. I think a lot more players are foreign on English Mush than we might realize!</p><p>It can be a good and bad thing depending on the circumstance. I do think that most of the time, players should try to stick to their own version of Mush if they are not good at reading and writing in English since good communication is important for both human and Mush teams. I don't think <img src="../../../../gfx/square/twinoid.png" alt=":twinoid:" class="tid_ico"> Twinoid will do anything to enforce this though.</p>

                <p>Since the game is only in two other languages (and you already mentioned them) French and Spanish, there can't be done much about it, except translating and hosting Mush for several other languages. Even if that is done, people would still join the English version more, then the one in their own native language.</p><p>Why? It's simple, there will always be more players on the English version because there always will be a language that is not yet introduced. Players from that speaking area will of course join the English version, thus it will be more appealing.</p><p>EDIT: Even if Mush (or any other game) is translated in to every language possible, the English versions of those games would still be more appealing for the players because those communities will always be bigger.</p><p>I've played a few other browser games in the past, let's say, 10 years which had over 10 language translations. In some cases it helped and I saw increased activity in their respected native language, but in the end it always came down to the English version as the most active...</p>

                <p>I've never played Hordes to see how it really is and I joined die2nite in season 1 (maybe even before seasons were introduced, it was long time ago, I don't really remember, heck I couldn't even remember my account). But you raise a valid point there.</p><p>Anyways, what I meant is (me not being English) will of course chose the English version over other languages. Even if a translation for another language that I speak is released, I'd still pick the English, just because more people speak it. Although if my native speaking language gets introduced, I'd play that + the English version, only because it'll take time for it to get popular here and have active players.</p><p>To answer the initial questions, there always will be someone with broken English that's playing the game just because the English language is the only one from the options they understand/<span class="tid_wspoil">better then the rest.</span></p><p>A direct answer to your question <em>Scout</em>, would be <strong>no</strong>, the games <em>I played the most</em> were not made for the English market at first. They were translated like Hordes and Mush and still, because of the reasons stated above, the English player base got bigger and bigger and became the largest.<br>(Some of the games had over 10 translations, not sure if it's allowed to discuss other games in this manner here, so I wont be mentioning which games I'm talking about)</p><p>But on the other hand, we have the global market, which is populated by English games, being translated to other languages and not reaching their potential like on the EU/US versions.</p><p>Perhaps Motion Twin's main goal is not focusing on spreading the games in other areas but rather focus on small groups and communities. Plus, my personal opinion is that the translations they have on some games is not complete, even their platform is not fully translated, which of course translates in to less acceptance. Maybe that is the reason for die2nite and other games not reaching their full potential like their older brothers, Hordes... Anyway, I'm just babbling here, I don't know Motion Twin plans and goals so I'll stop.

But, I don't agree the some what incomplete translations hurt the games as much as their not being anywhere near AAA or mass appealing. The games are slow. In a good way. :o It's by design but the majority of game players online might want a less communicative and more fast game to play. That's not a bad thing, I've been playing Diablo 3 to bit these days. I've marked myself "busy" because holy crap, I have enough communication in Mush, I just want to play solo. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I'm always amazed at you guys who speak another language so well.

                <p>You are the second player to question my using the actual Nationality, but there is a good reason to be upset specifically with French players that cannot communicate in English, but are playing on the English Mush server, and that is they already have the BEST Mush server, the Original French one, with no translation errors (because its the native language of the game), and more established players. We (the crew of this ship) clearly wanted to continue, and said so repeatedly, and if this player had any decent English comprehension, I would have reported them for Griefing us, but since they just didn't know what we were doing, its hard to blame them personally for their questionable play. This player also was not scanning either, so we had to work around them entirely, just to have them mess up our game irreparably, by surprise, worse than the ship's actual Mush attacking us ever could <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>If this game were like Arkaedo, it would not matter at all, as tons of non-English players compete on the English server (or it has linked servers), and it does not matter at all, but Mush is HIGHLY team-based, and communication based. You cannot succeed on your own, and you need to know clearly what each person is doing, especially Freida, who's normal job is to relay the coordinates of potential expo worlds, and no one else can see her scans. But this applies to most of the characters in some way.</p><br><p>How many rations will Stephen cook when he cannot understand the crew's food needs ? ( four, or sometimes 8, I mean, why not, the points are free, what's the worst that could happen ? ), where will the Jin Su move the ship to when the coordinates are gobbledegook (he won't move the ship at all, it has turned out <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> ) When will Raluca need a reset on the PILGRED, who knows ? Are the plants getting watered by Ian (an issue on my current ship), Why is Pilot Hua using the ship's turrets ? (my last ship) Will Janice ever change the really bad starter BIOS settings ? (not until we got rid of her <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> ) When will wandering Chun come to the lab to help (never).</p><br><p>You just need to be able to speak the language passibly to play Mush, and if you can't, even an inactive would be more useful, because we could get the command titles back faster, and would not have to kill (what have turned out to be) all human non-helper players. If I were goofing around on the French Mush server, ruining their ships, they would have every right to complain about me, since I also have a good server I can play on with no translation or language issues.</p>

                <p>From what you're saying, I believe I was the first one who questioned it (I think I was Jin Su on your current ship). But I still don't see what that player's nationality has to do with what he did (and I'm not saying that to defend him just because I'm French ; I really despise people who do things like that). As Scout said, that player does speak English (not perfectly, but well enough to speak and to understand what people say). I'm sure he would have done exactly the same on a French ship regardless of what the crew wanted, because he's obviously one of those people who think the game is over if there is the slightest problem. An English-speaking player could have done the same on an English ship. It's got nothing to do with English comprehension, at least in that case. The fact that he didn't do his job has nothing to do with the fact that he's French either. On the contrary, being French and knowing the game quite well, he should have know what he was supposed to do, as opposed to non-native speakers who are discovering the game and don't understand anything. I'm not finding excuses for him, on the contrary, he sounds like a very bad player... but he would be a bad player even if he could speak English perfectly.</p><p>That said, and more generally, I agree with you. You can't play that game if you don't understand what's going on. First ships are already difficult for native speakers or people who speak fluently, and it becomes totally impossible if you can't speak and can't understand what people tell you. Though, again, I've seen many English-speaking players, or French-speaking players on French ships, do the mistakes that you describe. You can speak the language perfectly and still cook all the rations or shoot from turrets when you're a pilot, or stay on the bridge if you're Chun.</p>

Everyone is surprised by the return to Sol, Only in the final comments section does Frieda finally reveal why we could not talk to her at all, she never posted in French during the game, we never knew what was happening, or why, until it was too late. I will admit some English players have done the usual screw ups that I also mentioned, but hacking the bridge for a premature Sol 'win' is pretty complicated and unusual fail for a human player, and we were careful and didn't complete the PILGRED until all the Mush were dead, and we thought it was safe to make some coffee <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I'm Spanish and no one has ever asked me if I was not a native speaker. In fact, apart from the occasionally mistakes I might have, I think that I write better than many English natives (people that are not natives don't make mistakes like writing "should of" instead of "should have", or "your" for "you're" or similar things).</p><p>About the problems that come when you don't speak the language of the game you're playing, or speak it poorly. Well, I'd say first that there are always people who don't communicate at all, for many reasons, maybe they don't speak English or maybe they do but they don't want to speak it; it's the same thing in the end, they are inactives who ruin the game in a way, but they are also part of it, of they can even be mush.</p><p>I think that if you want to play and try the best of you and be active, you should be allowed to play even if your language skills are not that good. But keep in mind that this will affect your performance in the game, because it is a game where communication is the most important thing.</p><p>If I play the French version, I would be a worse player because I wouldn't be able to communicate properly.<br>If I play the Spanish version (as a Spanish native), I would be a worse player because I don't have any motivation to play. It's not only that I think that the community is worse but also my personal desire to play the game in English.</p>

                <p>I started playing Diablo 3 a bit again after a 1 year break but yeah, I'm mostly getting ready for the expansion. I hope to be Paragon 100 by 2015. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Blubberflash, it's so true, the time it takes to use a translator does make the game even more time consuming if you need to use one. Which is why I won't play the French game. The thing is with this game if you move around and aren't talking you are very much suspected as Mush so the crew takes care of those who act like that anyway heh because this is what Mush often do.</p><p>Dahk, lovely post, we're all just people with a common goal - to get Mushy. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Its not a matter of speaking poorly, those players are usually fine, its the not-speaking-at-all players that are not inactive, but simply don't do the things their character's have exclusive control over, or just random things that don't help. Its REALLY bad when a non-speaker is captain. It has happened SO MANY times. Its happening again, we will just doodle around for a few days, usually getting random unannounced morale speeches in this or that dorm, then kill him for not captaining, you kinda got to keep killing the (so far always human) captain till you get a talkie captain, I've been all the way down to Stephen before, It does not matter if the new captain is a new player, if they can just be online twice a day and talk and listen in English, we can finally play the game. SOOOOO much need a ship-moving second-in-command, I keep suggesting it, and the people that moderate keep shooting it down, but it just solves the captain no-talkie situation so well. Its no big deal if the captain wanders randomly and has no clue, if his number 2 can just get us where we need to move to.</p>

                <p>Cheh. As an American, I can conclusively state that we speak American first, and English second, if at all. The languages diverge more and more every generation. I also happen to speak Japanese fluently, for what that is worth.</p><p>Seriously, I think I see both sides of this. On the one hand, I've had multiple experiences where an ESL individual bollixed up our gameplay and our ship, and/or never communicated with us. On the other hand, I'm currently on a ship where the best communicators are French, Spanish, and English speakers mixed.</p><p>I think the real issue is what constitutes griefing behavior in the game of Mush. Not communicating, not using translation mechanisms be they on or off line, taking certain actions without the consent of crew, wasting resources needlessly when not a beginner, not asking questions... all of these things could be considered griefing as well as poor gamesmanship in general.</p><p>However, being a poor sport and/or a bad gamer is truly language independent. It is not fair to blame language or nationality for this. The example given where plenty of communication was given and the person returned the ship to Sol was the fault of the player, really. They were online, they had access to French&amp;English translators. Their failure is that of being a poor gamer, for whatever reason, I feel.</p><p>I've gamed on the French Mush servers as well, that was an experience! The translations were close enough for me to get by, and they certainly did make fun of the horrible American-to-French hashes of a translation that GoogleTranslate made of my oddball phraseology. Not to mention the time-suck that translating every post one by one.... gah! I always did wonder what they thought of me, as I was moderately effective as Terrence, despite it all.</p><p>In any case, I welcome the learning experiences, even if it means that an occasional game sinks due to someone being stupid and obtuse.</p><p>(<em>Heck, I've unintentionally sunk the occasional ship or side when experimenting with different strategies and tactics, usually as the mush trying out different skills</em>!!!)</p>

                <p>I've had a few Russian people in my games, and a bunch who I learned late into the game spoke Spanish as their first language, or whatever. I'm totally fine if we can communicate, even if they struggle a little bit. What I don't like though is end messages in the wrong language. You should be able to write an end message in the language you played, or your level isn't high enough for playing it.</p><p>But yeah, I expect people playing games in English whose first language isn't English, I mean, my first language isn't English, either. It would be silly to ban me from the game for that reason when most other people wouldn't notice unless told.</p><p>There are some people on the French version whose French isn't that good either, but I would agree that it mostly happens on the English version. I wouldn't know about the Spanish one.</p>
