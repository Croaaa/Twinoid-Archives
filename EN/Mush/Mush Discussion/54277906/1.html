                <p>Early on, perhaps a pilot but poly Andie would be drawn to taking out hunters instead of research - even outside of this game, some people tend to leave things for others to do but on the other side of the coin - if you want something done right, do it yourself! Although Andie with silver - pilot and poly would be preferable over Janice with shrink and diplomat for planetary expeditions.</p><p>Even though Frieda is nice with pilot, sometimes, I've seen ships where Frieda only chose Pilot and those ships I don't think did as well (perhaps a little better in the seasons starting in orbit). Current ship, finding that safe oxygen planet proved elusive (in the end, went to a planet with one of the insta-death zones).</p><p>Every ship can be different and circumstances could mean other not-often-taken skills do well to complement the main skill. Perhaps a casting ship with 3 starting mush would push a silver but human Ian to choose his spore removal skill instead of one of the other commonly taken skills.</p>

                <p>I've always played on gold mode except first couple of ships so i'll tell about it. My favorite character of all time is Eleesha (tracker, observant, it-expert, tech). She collects all the logs better than any, she can seek for free, she can dismantle stuff, and she can hack command terminal when it's needed. Very useful as human and quite useful as mush. <br>Second best in my list is Gioele with coffee junkie +astro+solid+paranoid. For obvious reasons. I can't imagine reaching Eden without him.<br>Third - idk - maybe Janice 4th lvl or Finola.</p>

                <p>To me, a level 4 gold Frieda is extremely fun to play. IT Expert gives a good boost to scanning with astro and she can hack the terminal easily since she's always on the bridge. High in command list which gives her double reason to be on the bridge. And then survivalist/pilot makes her great to go on expos.<br>Level 4 Roland is pretty good but it's hard for me sometimes to choose between skills higher then level 5 and Firefighter. I have yet to see firefighter in use.</p>

                <p>Looking at the skills I'm like "uhhh.. I want everyone in gold mode!" <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>For <strong><em>Gold</em></strong> my top pick goes to <strong>Terrence</strong> though. Skill choice as silver or even Bronze is so horrible: It's always between taking the signature skill, Tech and Pilot while as gold you can just pick all of those and get additional Shooter or IT points. Usually gold Terrence can run most of the ship alone as he can upgrade drones to the point broken equipment and fires aren't an issue any more.<br>My pick for 2nd place goes to <strong>Jin Su</strong> with Pilot, Leader, Logistics and either Shooter or Strateguru. He simply shines in gold mode and can make a ship better. <br>Third place is looks rather difficult to me and I got several in mind. <strong>Andie</strong> with Pilot, Devotion, Polivalent and Confident or Expert(depends on morale sources) is just great.</p><br><p>Ok, continue with the <strong>Silver</strong> stuff...<br><strong>Raluca</strong>'s Tech is very often a necessity an a 2nd skill slot for Genius/Physicist.<br><strong>Roland</strong> with Pilot and Shooter. Hunters. Period. Although he has a nice set of skills at his disposal those 2 are the only mandatory. Everything else can just save small AP. No gamechanger...<br><strong>Janice</strong> with Shrink and Diplomat is perfectly fine. IT Expert and NERON's Only Friend or Self Sacrifice are in the end luxury skills.</p><p>For<strong><em> Bronze</em></strong> I got to pick from the rest...<br><strong>Chao's</strong> Torturer as his only viable skill. The rest usually just increases nastiness and efficiency when beating someone up.<br><strong>Chun</strong> with Mankind's Only Hope. I personally don't fancy Lethargy compared to other AP-skills and the rest are just minor skills.<br><strong>Derek</strong> as Firefighter, Wrestler or Shooter. All his skills are comperatively weak on their own and have little to no impact on the ship.</p>

                <p>Yeah, Advo, Terrence would also be my number 1 in Gold, such a skillfull player and his disabled trait makes it actually even more interesting and often more ap saving.<br>As I hinted already, Andie would be number 2 in my gold list. <br>For me the third is difficult, since I have no other character levelled up enough that I would have 4 great skills (often 3 great ones though ^^). I guess I agree with Morgaine here, a levelled up Gold Ian would be the green monster.</p><p>Silver:<br>Eleesha - her main job can be done pretty fine with just tracker, add Technician and she may be a game changer for a pilgred repair when everything else seems hopeless. But as I saw, she is actually quiete a powerhouse as gold with IT expert and polymath. Makes her MUCH more efficient, but at least these are "just" ap saving skills.</p><p>Kuan Ti - he has many different important skills, but often they synergize not that well with each other. Having Tech skill would be great, every other skill may depend on situation of ship. Therefore I pick him in my top silver list.</p><p>Now third one is Raluca, I just like to play her and she is totally fine with physician and tech. Eventually... she may be more trustworthy when she has only technician and saves one slot for genius. I feel the pain to constantly be in worry of a pilgred rush when having a physician/tech Raluca on board.</p><p>Actually I would have to put also this one here:<br>Gioele - He actually only needs coffeeine junky and astrophysicist to be the orange monster. That not taking paranoid may make mush hunt more difficult...well..on a random ship the cameras may be more important, but on an active one, when research is going quickly, it may not be needed.<br>Now the only problem is his face, which prevented me to play him even once so far.<br>Just thinking about he would stare at me like that the whole game ...<br>Just look:<br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Jf1CgmK.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/Jf1CgmK.jpg</a></p><br><br><p>Bronze:<br>Stephen - His apprentice skill alone rocks totally. I think there is no other skill of him, which helps that much, just each one may make him <em>a bit</em> more efficient, but no other crucial skill.<br>I guess that is perfect character for bronze (or silver).</p><p>Roland - shooter is not needed, a bronze Roland can do really fine - just has to eat eventually more stuff without additional skills (which may not be possible on every ship), but it doesn't change his performance much. Therefore Roland gets in my Bronze toplist.</p><p>Third spot is difficult, a violant mush hunter like Chao and Derek maybe.</p>

I considered only skills important to be able doing the job. having 2 - 4 ap more a day to do it, is in my opinion normally not that game changing. A Roland with Sprinter, shooter, pilot and creative could probably be up to 50% more effective though, but the crew may also adapt here: Giving Roland missions, sharing him logistics, letting him have more coffee or rations etc.</p>

I don't think its lame as long as the mush actually do some decent damage and it wasn't done right after mush select, otherwise its pretty lame. Anyway, that's off topic.</p><p>Gold... I do like Terrence being gold for maximum flexibility and his skills are great. Jin Su for being a great support character (LE, Strateguru, Leader). Can't think of another, but Hua fits all three quite nicely, and I like that she actually is good at bronze, and improves with each upgrade</p><p>Silver, Raluce is obvious first choice. Finola is decent at gold, but you'll either need medic/biologist if people are less active (and therefore are more likely to go to sol anyway) or medic/diplomat if you have extra ap in the crew to do research quickly, and therefore can spend the effort trying to get towards eden. Roland has the nice shooter/pilot combo, and all other skills are secondary.</p><p>Bronze: Janice, with shrink is the best. Can't think of anything else though.</p>

                <p>Hm.. the rule about avoiding intersections makes it kinda hard to pick the favourites since I'd say there're plenty of characters, who are great for both bronze and silver or silver and gold mode, but I'll try to make my list without sliding down to the Vienne diagrams X)<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>If I still played in <strong><em>Bronze</em></strong>, I'd go with these guys for sure:<br><strong>Andy </strong>with Poly, <strong>Chun </strong>with MOH or <strong>Janice </strong>with Shrink. <br>Because grabbing a polyvalent Andy is a guaranteed way to get a diplo (plus the fruits bonus for expos and diplo bonus for trading), as well as at least 1 guaranteed researcher. I consider Polyvalent Andie's best skill in every situation unless ship has issues with piloting. (S)He is one of my favourite characters from the skillset point of view, and is awesome in silver and gold too, but I'm giving them a top bronze rank since there're plenty of other characters I'd prefer seeing in gold/silver if I have a poly Andie on board.<br>Chun and Janice are in this section mostly because it's their most valuable skill while others are more like nice bonuses to this pretty-much-must-haves, and having just that single skill is enough for them in order to do their jobs well. Plus, speaking of how the skills influence on how interesting character's job will be: Chun's mostly interesting due to her immune trate only and doesn't change much based on the skills she has. While Janice's is mostly interesting due to the capability to make Neron announcements, so again - other skills will just make her more efficient while working on researches/projects, but won't change much.<br>And if I were playing in bronze, I'd better leaved the characters that are more valuable in gold/silver for those who play in those modes. <br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p><strong><em>Silver</em></strong><br><strong>Raluca </strong>with Tech and Genious/Physicist (depending on how the mush hunt goes and if Genious will be required at all), <strong>Finola </strong>with Medic and Diplo (I don't like her being both Biologist and Medic much since it helps to advance research way too fast making it hard for mush, especially low-levelled ones, to proceed with interesting plotting, though I tend to choose her playing in Gold myself, just keeping research progress in fair speed) and <strong>Gioelle </strong>with Coffee Junkie+Astro (I'm not a fan of Paranoid skilll and appreciate a scanning Gioelle way more, even without Astro skill).<br>Ian also seems a great choice for a silver player with his Botanist+Biologi:st.<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p><strong><em>Gold</em></strong><br><strong>Hua</strong> is my top favourite one for gold mode since she is so versatile with Pilot+Tech+Botanist+Survivalist combo and can cover gardening and tech work in case ship has difficulties with them, plus with Pilot+Botanist+Survivalist she's such a win for the expeditions! And I concider expeditioning as the most entertaining part of the game, besides mush hunting (but you can perform the latter quite efficiently without having any specific mush-hunting skills, sooooo..)<br>The other two I'd like the most in gold are <strong>Paola </strong>with Logistics, Shooter, Gunner and Rebel and <strong>Eleesha </strong>with Observant+Tech and Determined +IT Expert.<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Terrence, Jin Su, Chao, Stepnen, Frieda and Roland are great both in silver and gold, from my point of view.</p>

                <p>On a recent ship, I was the main pilot with a Gunner Paola for backup. Decided to spring for Targeting Assist, which meant higher % on the turrets, plus Paola got the lenses to herself since the pilots no longer needed them. We got her everything to help buff the turrets except the elusive Invetebrate Shell.</p><p>The hunters never stood a chance with a well-supported Gunner Paola and a Shooter Hua on board. One wave was 20 strong and she took out 14 before I even had my turn. Jin Su was able to focus solely on his Commander duties. Paola got second place in ship glory, behind only me. It was beautiful. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
