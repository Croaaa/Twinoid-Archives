                <p>So, I've been playing some Mush games. Not a whole lot, but I think it's around ten. And what I've been noticing is that most of the times, the humans rather lose to the environment than to the Mush.</p><p>Yes, mostly it is because there are always inactive players in key roles, who log in, get themselves dirty, waste AP on the so called "tutorial" and then disappear to be never seen again.</p><p>Nevertheless, I think the game has a lot of potential to have action in it. At the moment, there is not much action, but it is most about perseverance. Of course I had games, where it came down to a rampaging Mush at the end, which was fun, but only the environment makes it possible. In most of the games, the Mush are rather inexperienced or inactive and the humans lose anyway, because of all the fires/hunters et cetera.</p><p>So, the idea would be to make the game a race between the Mush and the humans, where the Mush become stronger (in different ways) in time instead of the environment. The Mush need more possibilities to act sneaky and do subtle damage to the humans without them noticing it. It should not be possible to lose for the humans if the Mush are inactive, that's the whole point. I think it would make the game far more entertaining, than for the humans to simply struggle for survival with or without Mush.</p><p>I have a lot of ideas on my mind, but I wanted to see the thoughts of the community about this first. I'm sure a lot of people feel this way.</p>

                <p>Environment's not so bad, IMO. The mush on the other hand, are doomed. Showerproof is a must-have on any actively mush hunting ship. Otherwise, the mush almost always get suppressed to the point where they can't do anything.</p><p>I do agree that the mush should get stronger in time. They're quite powerful once you get about 3 living mush, but solo mush in a crew with mycoscan or pheromodem is effectively neutered.</p>

Just a "you can't lose this situation, lay back for 10 days"?

If the Mushes are alive, anything can happen (Daedalus destroyed, Sol without Serum, Sol with Serum). And if they are dead, the crew can choose between the "easy" way (environment is too hard for us - let's go for serum and Sol) and the hard way (the environment isn't hard enough for us, we get the serum and will find Eden!). The Serum/Sol-win isn't that hard with maybe 6-8 active crew members (more or less according to roles and activity).</p>

                <p>On a normal ship ( not-so-active ^^) it is actually not too difficult for mushes to get at least a third mush within the first two days. and after that mushes have enough power to harm the ship effectively. Once I was on a ship and a griefer accidentally killed my mush partner right at the start. but I was able to get another mush partner the day after.</p><p>On these active ships like from MMM I think it is almost a different game. And yes, really more difficult for mushes. But on the other hand lots of people who participate at these ships also have advanced mush skills which can compensate the problems for a mush at least a bit.</p>

(partially due to inactivity of important roles). I'm sure it would be more interesting if the Mush actually had to do something in order to win. I had maybe one game in which the Mush were active, that's all. If humans are mostly inactive, Mush should win, if Mush are mostly inactive, humans should win. Currently, the Mush win whether they are active or not and it makes the game less interesting, since it's always the same scenario, because the environment doesn't change. The Mush should just play a greater role to make more impact on the outcome, while the environment should play less.</p>

The Alpha Mush are dead. Also dead is 1 crew members due to a trigger happy Chao and paranoid Gioele, who thought they were the Mush. Furthermore 2 people are dead due to a Mush throwing a grenade and finishing off people. (and I don't count that into Mush capabilities, since anyone can throw grenades and swing knives). Then, we have 4 to 5 inactive people sleeping in a corner. So, we have about 9-10 out of 16 crew members, who are completely useless. The ship has about 20 armor left, 8 oxygen and let's stay positive 10 fuel left. You are standing on the bridge with half AP due to some recent events. 12 hunters are on the Daedalus' tail, of which 2 are aracks, 2 are Trax and 2 are Asteroids. Ideally, you would need 2 people to take down the two Aracks with turrets, 1 person to load some fuel and yourself to move the ship. How in the name of all that is holy does one expect this situation to work out, considering a realistic chance for 4 of the remaining 6 people to be online at the same time?</p><p>And this is absolutely NOT the worst case scenario. It's a very average day 4 or 5 scenario on every ship in every game. There is certainly something not right here.</p>

                <p>To be honest, I think a simple change to the game would be this...</p><p>- At the moment, mush are chosen when the 16th player joins the ship<br>- It is possible on some slow filling ships that the anti-spore gas is already at 60%+<br>- The hostile mush chance of finding the Apron/Sample and securing them on a fast filling ship is still rather limited, meaning they are immediately neutered.</p><p>Suggestion:<br>- When the 16th crew joins the ship, activate a 24h incubation period before the Alpha mush are converted/aware they are mush. Lore-wise at this stage, the crew are unaware any mush are onboard.<br>- After 24h, the alpha-mush are chosen and the mush sample spawns randomly somewhere on the ship (dropped by the transforming mush as they awoke).</p><p>The Mush get a chance to secure the sample, but more importantly the fully complete active crew can focus their starting resources on getting the ship together, preparing for their first expedition etc, it could add a more interesting dynamic to the game.</p>

But I will say this, as Jin Su with pilot/shooter you shouldn't be at 20 armor at all. If you've got inactive/dead pilots, you find one or two people you can work with, they move 1 fuel into the chamber, you blow up the aracks and move the ship. You don't need a planet in play to move the ship. Don't forget that. You Dont HAVE To blow up the hunters, just prevent them from damaging you.</p><p>As for grenades, so long as the neron admin hasn't removed the setting, you shouldn't be able to throw them at all. I have been playing since beta and not once have I seen a grenade used.</p><p>The o2 is HIGHLY possible to be that low but with 6-10 semi active people you should be able to make it to day 10 without TOO much trouble. You just need to get off your duff and organize people. Determine when people are online and plan around that.</p><p>You're complaining about environmental hazards being too great... Those would be fires/ship injuring team mates/Panic attacks/item breakage/Hunters.</p><p>So long as you have a semi active crew you don't need "Key roles" to manage those things. The only thing that you really need is Pilots, you don't even need them you just need to unlock the pilot from Neron.</p><p>The thing that KILLS the ship is a SEMI active captain(s)</p>

It's supposed to make you work to survive.</p><p>The only one that is going to make your ships better is YOU, the only Cruicial characters IMHO are Finola and Jin Su. Everything else can be worked around (I only say Finola because her early research (or lack there of) can make or break the long game for the humans))</p>

You are Jin Su. The Alpha Mush are dead. Also dead is 1 crew members due to a trigger happy Chao and paranoid Gioele, who thought they were the Mush. Furthermore 2 people are dead due to a Mush throwing a grenade and finishing off people. (and I don't count that into Mush capabilities, since anyone can throw grenades and swing knives). Then, we have 4 to 5 inactive people sleeping in a corner. So, we have about 9-10 out of 16 crew members, who are completely useless. The ship has about 20 armor left, 8 oxygen and let's stay positive 10 fuel left. You are standing on the bridge with half AP due to some recent events. 12 hunters are on the Daedalus' tail, of which 2 are aracks, 2 are Trax and 2 are Asteroids. Ideally, you would need 2 people to take down the two Aracks with turrets, 1 person to load some fuel and yourself to move the ship. How in the name of all that is holy does one expect this situation to work out, considering a realistic chance for 4 of the remaining 6 people to be online at the same time?</p><p>And this is absolutely NOT the worst case scenario. It's a very average day 4 or 5 scenario on every ship in every game. There is certainly something not right here.</p></cite><p>Your 'typical day 4 situation' amuses me. For one thing, you simply don't get anything but normal hunters before day 5. Sure, you could have 12 hunters, but they'll be all normal ones.</p><p>It is *not* typical, in my experience at least, to have done enough expos by day 4 to have 10 fuel left, and if you do - you're not going to 'typically' have only 8 O2 left.</p><p>Anyone cannot throw grenades, unless a specific setting is changed in the BIOS terminal. You see someone throwing a grenade on a 'typical' ship - go kill that Mush, would you? Throwing grenades actually <em>is</em> a mush ability, hehe.</p><p>By day 4 on most of my ships the Alphas are not yet dead... But neat this time they are!</p><p>20 armor left on Day 4? Again not typical... especially if we've moved enough to use 10+ fuel.</p><p>We have 4-5 inactives, well whew. The random number generator, on a typical ship, is playing softball with us, not hard. No way are we going to be in the kind of situation you describe. I remember a ship I was on with 6 inactives.... we didn't see a new hunter after the initial 5 were killed, period.</p><br><br><p>Here's what I focus on in a ship like that - teamwork and learning how to play with any active people there actually are, so that my and their future ships will go more smoothly. Remember, with only 5-6 actives, most of the food is just sitting there saying <strong>Here's the AP you need to get some stuff done!</strong>.</p><p>When I get a highly atypical ship like you have described, what I'm going to do is lean back, laugh a little, and wonder what my very soon to be started next ship will be like. Emotional distance, where needed. Death is just a new beginning, and a deadly situation is just a new beginning starting even sooner. Whew! Next ship'll probably be more fun and less frustration.</p>

                <p>Environment doesn't need to be nerfed. It would be so boring to just have every ship sail smoothly to eden after the mush are dead. To any half decent crew the environment really shouldn't start causing much trouble until after day 10.</p><p>res7less it sounds like your problem is really inactives. If the game was balanced for skeleton crews it would be way too easy when you get a ship full of actives. I would suggest maybe trying to jump at different times than your normally do. I normally jump at cycle 1 or 2 and I always seem to get ships where the majority of players are active, and from what Ive experienced any half competent crew should at least be able to return to sol.</p><p>As far as mush balance goes, I think a gold mush that has leveled up to showerproof and transfer can be incredibly powerful if they have a decent grasp of the game mechanics. But I think bronze mush are really too limited to be much of a threat, they really just seem to be able to support a gold mush. I think it would be good if mush got an additional skill slot for at least bronze/silver.</p>

                <p>In my opinion, the rough environment is in favour of the mush because you need the humans to be distracted and playing their roles on the ship. Not to mention that for a good and fun experience of surviving/mush hunting the environment is necessary or otherwise you just get another mybrute game.</p>

                <p>Showerproof itself is quite high level. Showerproof will fill up the only slot on a bronze player, meaning that they can't do a lot of very good mush tricks like trapper, demoralize, phagocyte, hard boiled, transfer, anonymush. Mainly the anonymush and trapper skills.</p><p>If you have a skilled mush and a skilled ship, it's near impossible to be able to do anything as mush. On my ships, we track morale, we track when people have eaten (and even set up eating runs which involve moving the apron from lab to refectory), we spot when everyone has been dirty.</p><p>We normally get constipaspore and antispore gas by Day 4 on a ship with an active Finola, and there's usually a biologist book or some boost from Ian/Chun/Paola/book to make sure it's done damn fast. Once people get Mycoscan, any ship with a decent mush hunter will have doomed the mush. Mycoscan works better than torturer. Terrence the only person allowed in engine room? Check Raluca for spores. After expeditions, check everyone in Icarus Bay for spores to see if one of the expedition team may be mush. Want to set up a trap? Find someone with no spores and put them in a corridor with a hidden mycoalarm.</p><p>The only way mush can win on most of these ships is if security is low, i.e. cameras, mycoalarms, Raluca turreting, shower watching. And patient use of trapper.</p><p>If you have a ship with Paranoid Gioele or Torturer Chao, the difficulty level for mush just ramps way up. Torturer Chao is not so much useful for mush hunting, but for preventing paranoid killings.</p>

                <p>I think it's definitely possible for Mush to win on a super-active ship. But they need to be careful, and clever, and patient. Probably the best early-game weapon you have, as Mush, against an active ship is <em>existing</em>. Remember that they can't win so long as you are alive, so play the long game. Shower-proof is NOT "needed" if you're playing careful. You just need a cover story. And since something as simple as picking up items can hurt you, it shouldn't be THAT hard to, over the course of the first 4 days, save up 2 spores per person.</p><p>Then, depending on your characters, you wait for the perfect time to strike. 4 spores means you can convert someone instantly on day change AND do a transfer, which can utterly ruin even a well-prepared ship. It's about biding your time and waiting for the perfect moment to strike, and playing politics in the meanwhile.</p><p>In my opinion, there's two reasons why you see Mush pose so little of a threat on an active ship:<br>a) People don't want to be Mush - The first and biggest one. Every single human victory I've been involved in was, ultimately, because one or more of the Mush simply didn't want to be Mush. This is magnified exponentially if you've got a "good looking" ship, and people don't want to feel guilty about ruining it. No matter how powerful you make the Mush, this guarantees their loss. I've seen many Mush suicide or just go inactive for this reason. I've even seen Mush go turncoat and betray their partners because they felt so bad about being the bad guy.<br>b) Mush are inexperienced. For many Mush, this is the first time they have EVER been Mush. They don't have mush levels, they don't know the details of how to play as Mush, and they've got no useful previous experiences to fall back on. Even if they HAVE been Mush before, it was probably on an inactive cakewalk ship. It's one of the most important roles in the game, and very few people have any idea how to play it, and usually haven't invested experience in it.</p><p>Until there's a way to deal with those two problems (and I have proposed solutions here, they are solvable, although I doubt they will be solved) you're right - Mush are going to have a tough time of it, and worthwhile Mush adversaries on an active ship are going to be hard to come by.</p>

That's why I think the Mush should play a way greater role than the environment. Everyone says "Well, that would be boring if everything was easy as soon as the ship is Mush free.". Yeah. It should be. Because it also should be really hard to make the ship Mush-free. The Mush should be way more powerful not only in terms of abilites, but more so in terms of stealth. Hell, they could even give the Mush an extra ability, that works according to the Character.</p><p>For example an Eleesha Mush could be able to erase a person's movement history. Cover the trails, so to speak. Enable his Mush mates to roam more freely.</p><p>Finola could do something about dirt since she's a germaphobe. Clean a Mush without a shower.</p><p>Gioele could do something against cameras. For example make one action per day unseen by a camera for a fellow Mush.</p><p>Janice as a psychologist could do mindgames. Give humans nightmares, psychological diseases, unleash the true horror, that is a Mush.</p><p>And so on and so on. The possibilities are endless! It would be a great multiplayergame if it was actually about Player vs. Player than Player vs Environment. You know, the same principle like in the mafia game, they probably took the idea from. An unknowing majority vs the knowing minority. That'd be great.</p>

That's why I think the Mush should play a way greater role than the environment. Everyone says "Well, that would be boring if everything was easy as soon as the ship is Mush free.". Yeah. It should be. Because it also should be really hard to make the ship Mush-free. The Mush should be way more powerful not only in terms of abilites, but more so in terms of stealth. Hell, they could even give the Mush an extra ability, that works according to the Character.</p><p>For example an Eleesha Mush could be able to erase a person's movement history. Cover the trails, so to speak. Enable his Mush mates to roam more freely.</p><p>Finola could do something about dirt since she's a germaphobe. Clean a Mush without a shower.</p><p>Gioele could do something against cameras. For example make one action per day unseen by a camera for a fellow Mush.</p><p>Janice as a psychologist could do mindgames. Give humans nightmares, psychological diseases, the horror, that is a Mush.</p><p>And so on and so on. The possibilities are endless! It would be a great multiplayergame if it was actually about Player vs. Player than Player vs Environment. You know, the same principle like in the mafia game, they probably took the idea from. An unknowing majority vs the knowing minority. That'd be great.</p></cite><p>I'd totally love this. Everyone would fear more a sneaky mush than a rampaging mush.</p>

                <p>Not all mush care about glory and try to destroy the ship as fast as possible. My goal has always been to see how long I can last and how many I can convert. A lot of the players I have played with feel the same way.</p><p>I dont think a skilled mush on a skilled ship is doomed either. As long as you understand the mechanics enough to make up believable excuses and keep track of what your morale should be and when you should be hungry you should be able to do alright. Its covering up that you dont get ap from food that can be a little more difficult so I always try to under report my ap and save a little bit in case someone asks me to eat to do something.</p><p>I wasn't recommending bronze players take showerproof, I was just trying to say that at the level where showerproof and transfer are unlocked (level 6 I think?) options really start to open up for a gold mush. I would never recommend a bronze mush take showerproof. Unfortunately it seems like bronze mush are almost forced to take anonymush unless they are just out to cause damage in the first couple days. I do think showerproof is a useful skill for a gold mush though, and I actually prefer it over phagocyte since the antispore gas usually gets done so quickly on ships now.</p>

                <p>GlyphGryph said the two main problems that need magic to be solved. On all my ships, there was only one, ONE where the mush was effective enough to hurt a ship, not only stall it. 90% of the time one of the two people were inactive, even on the MMM ship (but that was Jin Su, and there is a law somewhere that he must be inactive.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>Now I would add two other problems to that.<br><strong>One </strong>was already mentioned by Muz, that on an active ship...well you kind of need the waterproof. And be really patient. And Precise. Probably not doing mushy things until day 5. We didn't have Chao torture, we had 1 shower that was closely watched, and that was enough with a few guidelines combined with quick antispore. Because of this, I would love to have ANOTHER skill slot for only the mush, as a "utility" or something like that. Waterproof and free spores, these would go into this. You may pick one skill, like demoralise as there is the golden opportunity to kill one person on an active ship, but then the ship's Janice panics and starts to pay attention to morale. Now my skill is more useless, and as a Silver I can't even trap, only spike with waterproof. Flexibility sound good on paper but you really need to commit to each skillset.<br>Bonus problem is that you NEED to lay low for a while or go out in an explosion quickly. If you stay undercover since the ship is active, and even if you state that you won't be a part of pill and food test, there will be people who do, immunising half of the crew or more in their eyes. Not much counterplay against that as a mush, apart from simple resistance.</p><p><strong>Two</strong> I want to be a mush. I really do. For the last 3 ships I wanted to be an alpha, to try and practice against those laws I maintain on the ships. But this affects my character choice as there some that simply...well get boned. Example would be Paola. AP intensive, in the spotlight, no recurring chance to get dirty. I fear the day I would be a mush with her, same goes to Frieda, but at least there you can lie about the planet..one time. Finola would be the same, she can slow research but that never wins any wars, a compentent partner is needed for her. Because of these, I can totally understand why people get uninterested in a game if they get mushed with the wrong character, when they had a specific thing in their mind to play like.</p><p>There are some characters that suck at being mush,and the character specific mush skills would be great to counterweight this. But right now, I pick my characters based on my liking and my enjoyment if I get mushed.</p>

                <p>the only ship where mush were even partialy effective is the one im currently on, they destroyed soap witha an grenade and made us use like 20+ AP to recover only i alone used 12AP and 1AP indirectly by having myself punched out of bed not to use 3AP to stand up and then 4 more on showers cuz well no soap, and they cooked all our rations so now they are gone and even that wasnt enough to really stop us. What is stopping us is that noone is telling their morale and health so like 2 people have died because of that already cuz we couldnt boost their morale or health without knowing it was needed.</p>

                <p>I think it is important to distinguish between almost inactive ships, moderate active ships and incredible active ships.</p><br><p>on ships <span class="tid_user tid_user_5612 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="5612">res7less</span> speak of I would say it is even not bad if you were able to kill all mushes even if the daedalus was destroyed because of too much hunters... it is something to be proud of. On these ships actually the mush shouldn't have too much trouble, lots of people are often staying at unprotected rooms, only a few amount of people is really watching the steps of other people.. mush only have to convert the few active people on these ships and they will win for sure. A really nice game for a mush. so it is also a huge success to find all mushes on these ships <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> (<strong>if they are active, of course</strong>)<br>So I would say active mushes have big chances to destroy the ship quicker than it would be destroyed without the mushes <strong>(so it is also not very glorious for a mush to just hide on these ships and doing nothing, because mush should technically win anyway...)</strong></p><br><p>On ships <span class="tid_user tid_user_1384452 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1384452">MrMuz</span> speak of, people want at least get to sol with serum and prefer to reach Eden, they are trying to do their job as effective as possible and often admit to be watched (with sheets and such stuff :/ ). Of course mush have a hard time on these ships, they are just outnumbered by the huge amount of active humans. Probably the only big success the mush can accomplish here is to convert a human and get an anonymush (and do something about Eleesha). And when the mush is hidden the whole time they do at least technically win (if humans don't do unfair stuff like forcing mush tests on all people before return to sol- I hope that is currently proscribed; on the other side a hidden mush should also always at least try to convert more people if he knows a nice sneaky method <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> - and not just play like a human the whole game, that is unfair too). On these ships probably almost always humans will win, but... these ships are really rare and do you think a MMM - ship is a typical mush ship? ^^</p><p>So I would say the most fair mush/human competition should be on moderate active ships, where some people are active but not all of them. But active enough that the humans would win for sure if there were no mushes. The mushes are not that outnumbered / the ships is not that strict organized so they have probably a similar chance to win like the humans but they also have to play as sneaky as they can to accomplish it.</p><p>--&gt; the impact and effectiveness of mushes depends mostly on the amount of active humans and mushes.</p>

                <p>I don't think there is a way to perfectly balance inactivity. Well, maybe if for example a player is marked as inactive with the <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/laid.png" alt=":mush_laid:" class="tid_ico"> buff for longer than a day, his character begins to show for players, who are about to enter a ship. When a player selects the character, the inactive player gets a "you have been replaced" message and the new player enters the ship that has already been started as the inactive character. Well, of course some players might not be happy about it, wanting to start on a fresh ship, so there should be an option if one gets a started ship's characters to show or not. I for my part, would join already started ships and help out. But well, this is not where I was heading with this discussion. But, yes, inactivity is a big issue.</p>
