                <p>I've noticed a few do this but i kinda wanted to know the opinion in general about this. Which is RP text or "using the dramatic" to your advantage as a crew member or MUSH. It's kind of interesting to me as it can be rather powerful as a MUSH to distract people away from a problem by acting out a part you have built up.</p><p>Does anyone else use this or have any stories.</p>

                <p>Kind of a example (Now im dead, i have no worries). The ship i was just on was my very first mush round (80 honor, i hope that isn't too bad). The idea i had was that the louder MUSH ive seen, the worse they tend to do. So kinda being polite, making up tales as Kuan Ti helped. I always seem to feel like if i am being loud, im not doing well. It worked, 3 oxygen left when i decided to do kinda something silly. They were going to jump the ship again, so...i kinda did a over-dramatic reveal thing and hid in a not too obvious please. They stopped and went hunting for me, wasting 2 more oxygen. That is kinda the thing i mean about "using dramatics" to help. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> I guess it's a stupid idea.</p>

                <p>And I just don't get that. Unless the character or its skill set affects how the player plays the character. I swear I'm affected by the player when I interact in these games - if I'm scared, its because of the player - maybe what the player can do with their skills because of how they play - but the player - not their character. The two 'other' intimidating characters MrMuz named off tend to have solid - maybe it's the 'always armed thing' that makes them appear scary when people think about them?</p><p>But I've seen cuddly Gioeles and, my one game on the French Server, a valiant Jin Su, the sort that played so 'loudly human' that I flat out forgot my fear that he could be mush. He walked in on me in a camera-free room? Fine. He stayed for hours? Fine. I got abandoned (lost) on an expo by a fool who took us down to a highly dangerous planet when there were only two of us in Icarus Bay? Fine - that incredible figure of a Jin Su took the scrapship and came down for me, found me alive, walked me past the volcano safely, and even grabbed us both a fruit for lunch on our way back to the Daedalus... and he did this -while- others were up there killing a Mush who had just outed himself and was causing havok...</p><p>I've met Friedas who I found utterly compelling, Kuan Tis that terrified me, and a Finola who almost turned me into a monster in everyone's eyes but my own...</p><p>It's all about the player. You want to scare me? Scare me. You don't need to get Chao to do it. Just bring your own A game and weave fear for me into all you do.</p>

                <p>I guess it's the idea of how a good "murder mystery" should work. A good villain doesn't do things loudly, a good villain knows the spotlight makes his life hard. It's the other way for a hero. The hero always plays up to the spotlight. It has a effect on you, makes you form opinions and ideas and little stories that let you trust them more. It's why a good villain plays the hero till JUST the last second. It's how my last MUSH worked. Help the crew, do my job, find the oxygen planet when we were so close to death....and then when the hope is lost, pull off the mask and smile a evil grin because you know you have played them for so long.</p><p>As for Chao. I have noticed a LOT go for the "ANGRY GUNNER" way of thinking. It's how he works but i think when i play him, im going to be that more "Quiet rage". Im going to quietly threaten, im going to twitch and try to stay calm. I think he'd be far more a presence if he didn't act, but you knew he was one stupid joke away from snapping like a twix bar and murdering you for it.</p><p>XD</p>

I also perceive Paola as "poor naive Paola" after reading her bio xD</p>

                <p>I mean it's usually just better to take a character, roleplay him, and use the character's reputation to fortify whatever social goals you have.</p><p>It's not just background. Chao has a strong reputation as a griefer favorite on most ships, which adds a meta . The personal skillset definitely strengthens it. Jin Su's Commander trait attracts the leader types. Raluca's Antisocial will keep her segregated from the rest of the ship, at least in the mush phase. I've seen a really good mush hunter play Raluca and yet she had a hard time leading the ship from the rear.</p><p>I disagree with Impet that all characters are equally good socially with the right player. It's like going to an interview or business meeting with a t-shirt and flip flops. You can pull it off with the right charisma, but a similarly skilled fellow player with the right 'suit' (character) will do better with less effort.</p><p><cite>A good villain doesn't do things loudly, a good villain knows the spotlight makes his life hard.</cite></p><p>I've done mush Jin Su on my <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/519">first ship</a>. A very dominating mush Jin Su. Jin Su is best played loud. I basically just made the ship run around doing pointless errands, telling Ian to hunt mush, Roland to both scan and fill up fuel tanks, Frieda to fly out there and shoot down the arack, Stephen to hold on to the hacker kit as soon as Frieda kills the Arack (and runs out of AP to land).</p><p>It was a great way to play mush, creating a lot of chaos, yelling at people who question why I was dirty when I was doing the important role of leading the ship. And getting that final backstab in while they were suffocating in the orbit of an oxygen planet.</p><p>It's also why a lot of mush like to target Jin Su. Not simply because he can move the ship and give missions, but because he has the most political influence over the ship. Need a final decision between arguing people? Jin Su's word is final. Jin Su says that we put the camera in the medlab instead of the bridge? Yes, sir!</p>

                <p>Mmmm. I take Chun's word as final, myself. Assuming we have a Chun who's active and not clearly an idiot.</p><p>And I'll go gentle challenge, then deadly force with anyone, <strong>especially</strong> some fool of a captain, who fails to defer when it comes down to the wire if his word goes against the one known human and who gives bad advice for long. I'll be explaining to Chun what's wrong with the Captain's advice, explaining any abuse of authority that I see, and organizing with Chun + others to save the ship from such a monster.</p><p>Would get interesting at very very least. Your strategy as a bad commander was very well played, especially for your first game. But assuming the other players in the game had some experience and some decent opinions about how things should be going, what priorities were, what problems are looming and when and how those problems should be addressed -</p><p>Giving bad directions becomes increasingly obvious, and brands you as incompetent at best, obvious Mush at worst. And an incompetent Captain is more dangerous than most incompetents.... I'd say on some ships that playstyle's going to get stabbed fast.</p>

                <p>First time playing Chao is great, I went straight up to level 4 and went around carrying my blaster and loudly declaring that anyone doing suspicious stuff will get tortured, while borrowing the line, "You will talk, everyone talks."<br>Also, actually torturing people to emphasis my threats. I loved it. No signs of spores after mycoscanner either...</p><p>You just gotta know what you want to do with the character to play em. Your skills give you your clue on how they can be played. Some better compliment the inspiration of fear then others of course. While others are better at being well... whatever else you want to be.</p><p>EDIT: Nothing inspires more first impression fears then a Chao that immediately goes for the blaster and makes that known.</p>
