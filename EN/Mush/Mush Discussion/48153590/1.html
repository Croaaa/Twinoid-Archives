                <p>Long story short, a situation came up in my ship where two newbies independently made two mistakes in OpSec (operational security) because they didn't know better. At that point, Schr√∂dinger was out of the bag, so to speak.</p><p>One announced that the natamy rifle was being worked on, and one announced 'why did you remove the camera in the nexus.'</p><p>This caused me to adopt an emergency strategy that I wanted to discuss as maybe not being an emergency strategy in the future for some situations.</p><p>You see, the mush's greatest weapon is not their neat skills, it's their automatic possession of stealth and owning the initiative. They get to time their strike where and when it will do the most damage.</p><p>So taking that weapon away from them, even if you yourself aren't ready to strike or are maybe sure of only one of them (IMO) can be a good and valid strategy.</p><p>The discussion I'd like to start is: When is that tipping point?</p><p>For example, in my ship, the newbies broke OpSec and a rampage was nearly inevitable. Our Chun is not braindead, but is not able to be very active either. Staying quiet about what I knew would only have yielded the initiative to the mush to rampage at a time of <em>their</em> choosing, with most if not all of the human team unaware - and thus unable - to launch a pre-emptive strike.</p><p>What are some other valid reasons to 'blow the lid' off the mush hunt that I may not have thought of - where the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?</p>

                <p>I'm wondering if you want the Mush to attack if human wish to. If you choose when your enemy attacks...</p><p>That's why the human needs to be always prepared for the Mush rampage even when they're offline in the time, to make the rampage as least effective as possible, so put Ian in dorm with important people, ignore ASG and make CS instead, don't let Chao/Derek rest so long, hide all the weapon as well as grenade BPs, look at people visiting suspicious places... I think that the Mush will make hard how to rampage then. But human does otherwise than I adviced and that's how the ship breaks.</p>

                <p>In a casting ship, that may be sound advice - I am not qualified to comment on that.</p><p>In a random ship, that's a situational strategy at best because of another mush advantage: They know who the mush are. The humans have to start from a position of 'suspect everyone.' Chun is <em>sometimes</em> an exception because often Chun doesn't survive cryosleep with her brain intact.</p><p>So without that trust, how can the humans hide weapons without looking like mush themselves?</p><p>let's say Roland, who <em>is</em> human, hides the knife. Later Gioele, who also knows <em>he</em> is human, finds evidence that Chao is a mush; but he can't find the knife, and nobody knows where it is but Roland. Roland may be offline, but let's say he's not. Gioele can't exactly ask 'where's the knife' because that will clue the mush in that a human thinks or knows who they are. Rampage again, only now the humans who <em>should</em> be in possession of the knife are not.</p><p>There are variations on this theme that would lead me to believe that on a random ship, hiding weapons as a strategy would tend to hurt the human team more than help it. Of course, there are always situations were it's a <em>good</em> plan.</p><p>Now, having said that, my thread isn't about whether there are <em>other</em> situational strategies that made sense, it's about the strategy of bringing the mush hunt out into the open - and what the situations may be that would make it a good thing.</p><p>Please don't take that as hostile. I am merely trying to keep the thread on topic, while also not completely blowing off your very valid idea for a different situational strategy.</p>

                <p>If you mean to ask when you should actively bring the mush in on your plans and why... I'd say the best way in doing so is bringing them into a fake mush hunting thread and pin suspicion on a known human, explain a plan (probably something along the lines of RFS) and engage the mush to assist you with it. This has an opportunity to get more hands on the job and might discourage a mush from a rampage who might feel they are under cover. Just make sure you get the cure before they do.</p><p>Other than that, it's never a good thing to force a mush's reaction. Nobody wins in a forced rampage. Stealth and dagger is paramount when you're dealing with stealth and dagger mush. If you're dealing with mush who plan to rampage regardless then there really isn't anything you can do to stop it short from protecting important weapons and making sure Chao/Derek are low on AP at all times.</p><p>That's just my opinion from what I've experienced. Hope I understood you well enough.</p>

Some are not 100% proof, but strong grounds for killing. Others are mistakes I constantly see humans make, and much less solid as evidence. Experience helps distinguish the two, and erring on one side or the other can have negative consequences (murderships for the former, mush victories for the latter)</p><p>I'm not saying that open accusations and provoking the mush are <em>never</em> valid options. What I <em>am</em> saying is that I'd consider them specialty/emergency tactics only. In most cases you're going to end up with chaos (especially if the mush you're trying to provoke either isn't mush, or doesn't take the bait... whoops), and confused/angry/paranoid humans tend to give mush some nice wiggle room. Not to mention that if they <em>don't</em> flinch at your brilliant accusation, you've now given them warning to use in their planning.</p><p>And if you have dirt that's so juicy, your victim will have no choice but to panic?

Humans and mush can be so unpredictable. It will always be a gamble you have to take if you decide to act preemptively. It could save the ship, it could ruin the ship depending on the circumstances. You should also have a chunk of people on board with the idea because it can reflect negatively on you if you fail or get it wrong. Then the crew will have effectively lost a human (who was the suspect) and you and the mush will carry out their plan regardless except with 2 less people to worry about. That's why I'd rather be gun shy than gungho.</p>

                <p>The mush has the advantage of the initiative? Yes, in the beginning... but the longer the game, the mush is loosing more and more their initiative. The human team hunting mushes may get some evidences and strike then stealthy as well to eliminate the mush. It is as playing chess where white has the initiative in the beginning, but after some moves that initiative often doesn't matter anymore, the mush has to fear every second to be the target of killing.<br>Humans can do some research, staying in protected places and be careful, so a stealthy conversion may almost be impossible.<br>When humans did it right, mushes are realizing that a stealthy conversion is actually impossible, when humans did at same time research, which is making a rampage often not effective anymore.</p><p>So mushes actually have to act quick to accomplish something before being at disadvantage. Or they have such high-level/skills (human or mush) that they can afford to stay patient.</p>

                <p>I've only played mush twice, personally, and I usually was feeling the itch to rampage whenever the ship was approaching a critical point-too many humans confirmed, low on O2, or a big hunter wave shows up and you need to scramble quickly. I believe most newbie mush who have some intelligence will rampage pretty predictably at that point. Of course, in both my games, the humans more or less defeated themselves (with a little help from me), shooting people randomly with little justification, making it harder to find us. From a new players perspective, a tough investigation just made me lower my head and wait it out. I won both times, though I noticed it's alot more difficult if the ship is active...</p><p>IMO, awareness is the best thing. Doing your job is vital, but you need to be watching for mush. Also, don't kill anyone unless you are sure they are mush. Of course, you can never be 110% sure, but you need to move the odds in your favor before you commit. It's an irony that careless, sleepy humans are far more likely to make mistakes that a dedicated mush, who is watching their every move, hah.</p><p>Just new player thoughts. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>
