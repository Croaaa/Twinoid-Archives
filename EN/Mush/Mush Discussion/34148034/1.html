                <p>I've been on a few ships in which griefers caused more harm (both directly and indirectly) than the Mush players. I agree with others who have said elsewhere that they can be considered neutral outcomes, because that sort of "victory" was as a result of <strong>actively throwing the game</strong>. A ship that manages a return to Sol or Eden, having dealt with its Mush threat, as well as active griefing, should of course count as a well-earned human victory.</p><p>With that in mind, I would like to think of this in terms of <strong>degrees</strong> of victory and defeat. Glory aside, it really comes down to who fulfilled their goals. If we're agreed that the primary Mush goals are to:</p><p>1. Cause the ship's destruction, through sabotage or the death of its crew, or<br>2. Engineer a return to Sol or Eden, with Mush aboard</p><p>Then that means the Human team's primary goals are to:</p><p>1. Get to Eden<br>2. Failing that, get to Sol, AND<br>3. Make either return with no living Mush aboard</p><p>And the secondary goal: Research the Retro-Fungal Serum, and cure one of the Mush, if possible.</p><p>So I propose that even if a ship researches the serum, cures one Mush, AND gets to Sol/Eden with one or more Mush still aboard, it's a Mush victory/Human defeat. If a ship kills its Mush, but makes it back to Sol/Eden, it's a Human victory/Mush defeat. If a ship fails to return to Sol/Eden, it's a Mush victory/Human defeat.</p><p>These can be given some scale, though:</p><p>All Mush killed or cured, serum researched, and a return to Eden: Decisive Human victory<br>All Mush killed or cured, Serum researched, and a return to Sol: Major Human victory<br>All Mush killed, serum NOT researched, and a jump to Eden: Major Human victory (the research may still continue there, and there are no Mush on Eden)<br>All Mush killed, serum NOT researched, and a return to Sol: Minor Human victory.</p><p>Mush victories would scale a bit differently, because a return to Sol/Eden is quite possible for a barely-active Mush, and returns to Sol/Eden potentially involve helping the humans a little <em>too</em> much:</p><p>Preventing a return to Sol/Eden through converting/killing all of the crew: Decisive Mush victory<br>Jumping undetected to Eden, with the serum NOT researched: Major Mush victory (this brings the Mush infection to Eden, where it now has time to grow)<br>Returning to Sol undetected, with the serum NOT researched: Major Mush victory (this can take some effort on the part of the Mush team)<br>Returning to Sol/Eden undetected, with the serum researched: Minor Mush victory (you could have this result by doing almost nothing)<br>Destruction of the ship by Hunters: Default Mush victory (you could get this result by doing nothing at all)</p><p>And jumping to Sol/Eden while there are clearly one or more Mush showing in the Comrades bar is a clear Human defeat, in my opinion...it's basically giving up.</p>

                <p>That's a very valid point regarding the lore, due to a repaired Pilgred.</p><p>Part of the problem is, in gameplay terms, it's quite possible for a Mush to convert one person, go Anonymush, and be barely active for the remainder of the voyage...then claim "victory." Or worse, they actively help the Human team get to Sol/Eden, and stop doing any Mush-like actions. The prospect of playing against the Mush team in order to secure such a victory makes it specious as a "decisive" victory in gameplay terms, which is why I didn't make it one in my list.</p>

                <p>I think most of the victory nuance debate is kinda silly. Since XP is the only thing you take with you, a longer lasting ship is better for both sides, although i would say the longer the ship lasts, the better the human side has done, because barring body swap, all the glory eventually goes from Mush to the human side. To get in the Glory leaderboards at this point, you have to be human (a day 1 Mush ship destruction won't even get a Mush top 100 on glory <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> ), get to Eden, and kill lots of hunters, as these things are the big glory makers. killing Mush and making the cure just add more glory, making a record run more likely, but any record run will need to have lasted a long time and done a lot of expos, because these things increase glory a lot, and get you incrementally higher when you have done all the other glory things (rebel base, researches, your character's personal glory things). Honestly, if I can't get breakaway high glory, the only real concern I have is surviving a long time and getting XP, so the Mush incentive is to lay low, unless you hate being Mush, then your best play is to weapon and spore up, and go nuts attacking Janice or Chun right before the day change as soon as you are ready (technically not suiciding, but effectively getting you off the ship fast, and back to a most likely human character)</p>
