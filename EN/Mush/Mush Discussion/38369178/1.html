                <p>I would like to sent petition to Twinoit which would be focusing <strong>mainly</strong> but not <em>exclusively</em> around rebalancing and changing Chun's Lethargy skill. Aim of this petition is not as much to reverse it to it's previous stage, but to suggest diffrent kind of nerf than it has currently. Before update, bug made it possible to wake up during any cycle and use AP without breaking Lethargy Chain, as long as You finished cycle again in bed. This allowed player to gain even 8 AP more each day and acted as selflogistic *without having any real drawback*. Only thing that was needed to achieve it was ending each cycle in bed, and afther succesful chain of 3 cycles You started to gain 1 AP bonus. Currently situation looks diffrently - as waking up from bed will already cause breaking chain. And there is no possible action which would not make You waking up from bed - so if You want to get bonus AP points You need to stay in bed for many cycles without any form of action at all (while You still can participate in forum and private channels). This definietly made Lethargy more balanced towards diffrent skills of other characters. But it also made playing as Chun less interesting and put another burden on Your shoulders. Firstly You are burdened with <strong>Hummanity's Only Hope</strong> and secondly You are burdened with staying in bed as long as You can if You want to be mostly AP efficient (and who would not want to be?). With Your max AP doubled it is still an awersome skill, but it promotes more inactive play style, <strong>which is good if You don't have much time to be active player</strong>, but <em>it happens at the cost of active players</em>, where I think both - should have something to gain from this. The way I see it - doubled max AP is mostly for inactive players, while bonus AP gain is more for active players. But eoungh about Lethargy itself - bellow I will present my plan and what I expect to achieve by posting it here on forum, and everybody will have possibility to comment, add someting, suggest, show His support in more or less active way, or show His lack of support for any reson.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Lethargy focus<br><strong>a.</strong> suggestions on how this skill could work to promote both types of players - more and less active<br><strong>b.</strong> suggestions on how change/rebalance other Chun's skills so that active players would get really good skills while less active could still relay on Lethargy. Yes - that is right! Lethargy as a skill might be influenced by other skills! Do not think that just because we would change how "Premonition" works and Lethargy would be unchanged that would not influence how we see Lethargy as a skill! No skill exist in vacum - they are influenced by other skills and way we see them might be totaly changed (Biologist + Medic for Finola is Research Boost, Medic + Nurse is healing boost).<br><strong>c.</strong> while I am not a fan of this, there will be for sure some people which will want Letrargy to go back as it was before recent Patch - if You are one of those, than know that this will be also suggested in our petition, but for sure it will not be main focus (uless there will be simply large amount of players who will support us with THIS in mind).</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Suggestions regarding other things<br><strong>a.</strong> suggestions about concentrating to patch certian bugs in other characters' skills.<br><strong>b.</strong> suggestions about changing skills levels for certian characters (anybody level 1 bronze pilot Roland here?).</p><p>With all this please remember - spark that caused me to organize certian Mush players (yes, I am not alone in this and I did gathered certian support already before going public with that) is Chun's only interesting so far skill - Lethargy and that is why we would like to focus on this. So keep it in mind that while we do not want to close on other things, we want to focus mainly on this.</p><p>Now - few things to keep in mind here! First of all, we will not be able to gain anything if we will not get Your support! If You will read this and think "Petition? They will ignore this for sure! Wasted time..." than - You are absolutly free to think that way, but ask Yourself if such thinking is able to acomplish anything at all? Also wrighting "I support" do not take much of Your time. Sure - if You want to have impact on how it will look in the end, be active and influence this! Suggest! Disscus stuff. But giving just Your support means also a lot for us. Keep in mind that if said petition will be sent to them Your nick will be sighned on it if You will decide to support. If You would like to support but are affraid that others will treat You in any bad way because of that (and I am sure that there will be a lot of those who will be discriminating us because of that, I am almost certian that there will be peoples which will simply be unable to resist their ugre to say somethig offencive or to try antagonise me or any of those who support) - send me a private message. I will keep it confidential betwen You and me.</p><p>Most important thing - remeber, in democratic society we have all rights to write petitions to whoever we want and nobody can forbid us doing so. <strong>But that stick have two ends - in democratic society anybody reciving petition may as well simply ignore it or respond with refusal to it - NOBODY can forbid them doing so and we must accept that right.</strong></p><p>Mine finnal words before posting it? Hmm... Please, be polite, do not start flame wars, remember that we do not need to choose one "best" suggestion - there is plenty of space for many of them - in fact I think that proposing ample of suggestions to choose from will give better effect than being like - this is what we want! And remember that all what I wrothe here is open for disscusion and those are only planes. Main goal here is to gather support - the more, the better.</p><p>Thank You from advance.</p>

                <p>I don't support that at all. New lethargy is much more logical then "get up and do anything every cycle for 3ap", it's more balanced then "just +8ap for yourself a day" and it works as was planned and written. The only problem I see - people who was spending exp to get it, while it was broken, can be dissapointed now. Some skills are better then others, some high-lvl skills are not very interesting like Hua's return or Finola's OCD.</p>

Of course active Chuns are unhappy about it. <br>Lots of ships will have a problem if they always have braindead/inactive Chuns - in fact the few active Chuns I met on ships had mostly Lethargy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So I will support either 1.a (<em>for example Chun has always a a doubled ap-bar and a 75% chance to gain one extra ap when sleeping in a bed</em>) <br>or 1.b (<em>for example give Chun the Medic skill at a certain skill level-which would be even useful since Finola seems to be away for quiete a while</em>).</p>

Like Jin`s <em>Cold blood</em> or Stephen`s <em>Oportunist</em>... Or Gioele <em>Panic</em>.<br><em>Creative</em> should not cost 5+50+200+250+500=1005<img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/icons/small_xp.gif" alt=":ts_xp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So why are you thinking then problem only with <em>Lethargy</em>? It was bugged in last season. Bug fixed. Well whats a problem?</p></cite><p>The problem is, unlike the other examples, Chun's entire skillset is nothing but marginal skills, and she is all but forced to take Last Hope, which, although important to the ship, is not very interesting to play (it has no active use) No other character HAS to take a no-use skill for the ship's survival Even Gioele's <em>Paranoid</em> while also having no active use, at least gives you something to DO for 5 minutes (place your bonus cameras around the ship), before you are stuck relaying others with actual active skills.</p><p>There are many other marginal high XP cost skills, but all those characters have other skills that are good, so you can just not use the low use skills for them. Jin's <em>cold-blooded</em> is junk, and shooter is marginal, but his other four skills are awesome, and shooter can stack with pilot</p><p>Chun has no skills that work together well, <em>Premonition</em> and <em>Sneak</em> are VERY situational, and almost never worth a skillslot. Last Hope is a no-fun, no-use Millstone that you carry for your ship, and Nurse is only marginally useful on its own. Bronze Chun is VERY boring to play, and Gold days are all but wasted on Chun's marginal skill list.</p><p>To sum it up, without old Lethargy, Chun needs some good skills, so people will want to play her !! Some suggestions :</p><br><p>1. Make <em>Last Hope</em> a PASSIVE effect that is always on, like Pacifism, and let Bronze Chun have a fun skill, without killing her ship's morale, and free up a skill slot for a good skill</p><br><p>2. Give Chun at least one or more 'stackable' skills (i.e. works well with another skill). Replace <em>Last Hope, Sneak</em> and/or <em>Premonition</em> with something that works with her good skills, like <em>Medic</em>, which stacks nice with <em>Nurse</em> (powered up free heals, and lab bonus) <em>Astrophysicist</em> <em>Tech</em> or <em>Pilot</em>, which are good and useful high AP skills, that could actually use all that extra AP from <em>Lethargy</em> sleeping.</p>

Instead of fixing bugs and working on some missed translation from French to English, devs are going to spend time with petitions like this. And changing Lethargy to current state was fixing the bug, in fact. That some players don't like it because they spent the XPs for that, while it was still bugged and in result OP? Well, bad luck.<br>Maybe they should implement refunding option for all characters like they did with Chao and Finola on French server. But anything else sounds just like whining for me. You don't like how some skills are working? Don't take them. You think some character has only boring skills? Pick another character.</p><p>I like how Europa is conscious that this "petition" can have not any real effect in the end. But what is a second reason I'm not supporting this, is her talking about "democratic society". Online game is not democracy. Online game is merchandise product. Some of us are not really even customers, since not everyone is paying for it. And even paying customers can't <strong>demand</strong> anything by petition. They can give feedback. And if they don't like how theirs feedback was received, they can stop buying the product.<br>Petition is just too strong expression for my taste.</p>

                <p>I'll support this so called "petition", for what it's worth.</p><p>I agree with TradeFederation concerning Chun passive/useless skill. Let change some of her skills for a more active ones. or at least ones that will work well together.</p><p>As for "nerfing" Chun Last skill: Lethargy. I understand that they fix a bug and people are not happy. I'm in the same boat (Got a lvl 5 Chun here). I'm all up for fixing that skill into something different (doesn't have to be back to the original "bugged" Lethargy skill).</p><p>And you need to think about this: The dev not going to *stop* with Chun's Lethargy skill. You got a lvl 4 diplo Janice and Finola? How would you like it if they change something about it? Something *not* for the better? You spend 500 exp on getting Stephen awesome "Apprentice" skill? How would you like it if they change it so he can only copy *certain* skill from certain people. Or that Apprentice skill is too powerful so we're going to *fix* it so it's more like the "Polyvalent" skill. For example, you copy the shrink skill and it's only allow you to give everyone sleeping 1 morale and chance to heal their psychic illness (the passive part of the skill is copied), but no action skill like comforting someone. How would you feel about that, huh? That why there a "petition". To try to nip this in the butt before the developers start messing with other character's skills in the name of "fixing" those skills.</p><p>They "fix" the wrestler and solid skill for the better and the Lethargy for the worse. So i think it's only fair if they think about it (maybe even hop into their own game and play Chun for a bit), and think of an alternate way to "fix" Chun awesome last ability. Since her other abilities suck. And who want to play a crappy character?</p><p>In any case, I say they need to add in a "respec" feature for each characters. (You know how RPG games that has skill tree has a respec button that will remove all the points you have placed, back into a "skill pool" and will let you place them however you want once more?) We need something like that.</p><p>Developer want money from us consumers, right? How about creating a respec button that give back all the exp you put into a character at the cost of Klix coins? That'll makes the consumers spend real money on Klix coins that can be spent on things other than customization of your character or golden projects (which i'm not a fan of. The customize part, not the gold project part <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>That can be a temporary solution for everyone with lvl 5 Chun and lvl 4-5 Finola &amp; Chao. Get back your exp that you spend (at the cost of Klix) and when the developer improve Chun and bring back Finola &amp; Chao (hopefully improved and less of a pain for Mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) , then you can put those exp back into them. . . or spend them elsewhere. It's your money, do as you wish. . . is my opinion.</p>

                <p>I support this. As others have already pointed out, yeah a lot of characters have crappy top tier skills, but the difference between them and Chun is that they generally have some interesting skills on the way to the top tier. Lethargy was the one skill that make Chun seem appealing to me and with the current change I would never pick her. Only way I would play her is if I was forced to in a casting.</p><p>And I would love an option to refund xp on Finola/Chao (and any other characters that get removed from play, even if temporary)</p>

                <p>I didn't even know Chun's lethargy had been bugged in such a way. But I've always thought of her role as a coordinator, since Chun's most valuable ability is her innate immunity; she's the only person the entire crew can trust and so her role ought to be an even more social one than other crew members. A Chun who is not taking part in anti-mush discussions is not using her full abilities. She is also needed in the lab more than anything in the early game, so all of her time and AP should be devoted to the lab, and not moving back and forth to the bed at cycle change.</p><p>Skills make a nice reward for banking your exp, but they shouldn't give you super powers, and they shouldn't serve as a crutch. The main thing that should also determine your success, PvP or PvE, is your ability to communicate and spread information (or in the mush's case, misinformation). This also help levels the playing field for the larger metagame (which is already pretty unbalanced, but seems to be improving). So the nerf/bug-fix is a good thing, in my opinion.</p>

Ofc that skill has a really great potentional in mid/late game, but it requires a lot of work from the whole team - to get project you want, to make expoes and find fruits you want. You spend ap every day to keep garden, and only then you begin to get rewards.</p><p>What you had before was just +8ap every day except first 4 cycles.

                <p>You make a good point, Kyubey. Most of the "good" skill are in the low tier for most of the characters. Like shrink for Janice and Astro for Frieda (to name a few).</p><p>But what Aerial (and others like TradeFederation) is talking about is that Chun doesn't have any good skill in the lower tier as you slowly level up Chun into the highest level to get the awesome skill that is Letheragy. Unless you count last hope (which someone mention should be a passive like Ian non-aggression). Which *makes* people who want to play Chun get lethargy skill *because* they are active and want to actively play Chun.</p><p>You mention <cite>OCD on Finola. Antique Perfume on Frieda. Self-sacrifice on Janice. U-Turn on Hua. Metalworker on Terrence. Intimidating on Chao. Creative on Stephen and Roland.</cite> So does that mean you, Kyubey don't level up and play: Finola, Frieda, Janice, Hua, Terrence, Chao, Stephen and Roland?</p><p>What if we take those character mention above and turn all their lower tier skill into useless passive skills like what Chun currently have? And we put their Main "good" skill at lvl 5. How about now? Want to complain now?</p><p>That what going on. While it seem we are petitioning about the "change" in Chun last and only good skill: Lethargy, What we really "complaining" about is that Chun doesn't have any worthwhile skill other than Lethargy.</p><p>Take Hua. She all about expo. She a pilot at lvl 1, and botantist at lvl 2, and survivalist at lvl 3. Already she is the "king" (or in her case, Queen) of expo. She can fly the expo, and get more meat and fruit, so the crew want her on every expo mission. But getting to her last skill: U-Turn turn your Hua into a *GOD*. It's a pleasure to slowly lvl her to that point because all of Hua lower tier skills are worth getting.</p><p>Not so for Chun. All her skills (every single one of them) aren't worth getting, and the only thing to look forward to is her last skill: Lethargy. We wouldn't be complaining as much, if Chun has some worthwhile lower tier skill that work together (somewhat) like with the other characters.</p><p>If the developers decided not to change the patch of "Lethargy" because it is now what it meant to do, that fine. . . But can't they turn Chun other skill (lvl 2-4) into something that Chun can use? Something not worthless? Something that will make the patch of the new Lethargy more bearable? Something that will make people still pick Chun in the loadout (as often as before the patch) despite the new change to her Lethargy skill?</p><p>That all we're asking for <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I see your point, Jart, maybe I misunderstood the thread before (or your idea is a bit different from the others). <br>So I state my position more clear - I'm against buffing Lethargy, but agree, that some changing to her other skills will be nice. Having 1 must-have-skill (MOH) and 1 overpowered (Lethargy) while all others are useless is not better, then what we got after the patch.</p>

                <p>Thank you for your understanding, Kyubey.</p><p>They improved on the Solid and Wrestler skills (which i think was a long time coming since before they don't really do anything significant). Why can't they "improved" or change Chun level 2, 3, and 4 skills? While they're at it, they can "improved/change" Chun's level 1 and/or level 5 skill? Change it some way so these skills of hers work together to make Chun playable as a character. Even to a bronze newbie.</p><p>I think that what this "petition" is all about. To bring this "topic" of Chun's skills to the notices of the developers.</p><p>If enough of us "complain", we're hoping that they'll do something about it. They can rebuff the Lethargy skill (Which you don't want, Kyubey). They can redo all of Chun's skills to make her playable (this is my stance). They can make her first skill into a passive skill (which is someone else stance).</p><p>I think there was a tons of people (maybe on the french side) that complain about the problem of inactive on ships. And the developers solution is trader's ships and trading away hard core inactives. Which is a good idea.</p><p>Now, here hoping they do something about Chun's skills.</p>

Other generalists get fun spicy toys that make them worthwhile (Caffeine Junky, Apprentice, Tech, Astro, etc), specialists get their jobs to do. Her must-have skill is a passive bonus that doesn't change her play at all. Her other skills are kinda wimpy and underpowered. Again, they barely change her play style at all. The only reason really to play Chun used to be to get Lethargy.</p><p>People say "It was overpowered, Twinoid fixed it!" How was it overpowered? It was considerably weaker than Caffeine Junky, and only just as strong as Logistics. Plus it had more drawbacks than both of those skills because you needed to hog a bed and stay in it, making sure not to break your chain, just to use that skill at all.</p><p>Lethargy was fine as is. It made the character worth taking.</p><p><strong>Personally I feel like I just spent 2 months saving up for a character just to play her twice. </strong></p><p><strong>I want a refund on my XP.</strong></p>
