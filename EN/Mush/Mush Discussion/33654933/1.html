                <p>I understand that it breaks the rules to 'play to lose'. Be you Mush or Human, you are required to play to win. I'm fine with that.</p><p>But I saw a scenario where humans -were- about to lose. And I'd been a human and I'd been struggling to help turn that around for days. And then I got converted, in a blindingly audacious fashion that almost removed all doubt that I'd been converted - my converter, who dismantled the camera for a 'hidden shot' at me since she couldn't get me to behave the way she wanted, was killed for her obvious Mushiness. There were three possible people she converted, and it was accepted that she did that -to- convert one of us three. One of the three was an idler who had been inactive for days and was about to die, another was strongly suspected of being Mush (I knew, there were very few active players aboard, alas... really just 3 of us who were not Mush), and the third was me.</p><p>The other two players really didn't know what to do, then the other mush killed one of them. Over the next couple of cycles, morale hits slew all but four humans, oxygen at 4, game almost over.</p><p>I'd played as human as I could, I'd worked hard to do essential tasks and do them correctly, figuring all was lost anyway for the humans and we all might as well learn a bit more (it's only my second trip, and the last living active human, it's his first. And he played Chao, and played him awesomely and with good self control).</p><p>So now we're down to 4 oxygen, 4 humans, and I know Chao who is awesome was effectively helpless, no AP, no moves, no one to help him.</p><p>So I decided to tell him I was changing strategy, that yeah, I'd lied, I had been converted when they believed I had been, and I was changing strategy because it was time. And that I had a deal to offer him - I could kill the two humans beside me (who we both knew were offline, were NOT coming back anytime soon, one had never spoken in play and the other was online about 15 minutes a day) and very soon finish him off if that morale hit didn't end it, or I could cook him dinner.</p><p>One laced with 3 spores, which as I understand was enough to instantly convert him to Mush. Now I knew he had the blaster, and I knew he had his brand new day free shots with it - but was he fast enough to refresh the page constantly, when I could pick my timing, take as long as I want, to get into that room, drop his dinner, and run out again before he could see me and shoot me? We both knew he had to go to sleep soon.</p><p>We both knew humans could not possibly win. I told him he could say no, and I'd start killing the humans helpless beside me and soon everything would be over for all humans including him. Or he could say yes and join the winning side. That I was using overwhelming force and coercion, so that he could indeed eat that meal, knowing what it meant to eat it, and not be breaking rules because he was forced - he could only choose how he wished to lose and I respected and enjoyed his play enough that I wanted to share the win with him, and I had the power to make it possible.</p><p>As it turned out, he'd eaten too recently, he was full, and irl had to go to bed. So I went with plan B and didn't make him dinner. The final events are still unfolding, but there's not much time left and there's no more secrets on that ship. Only two humans live, briefly, and only because they haven't quite finished twitching.</p><p>But was what I wanted to do legal? If he'd accepted, would he have been breaking the rules? Could I play to take all choice and freedom from a player and 'offer' them Mushness or death, and could they choose Mushiness, without breaking the rules as long as I properly set up the situation so that they indeed could find no way to win? I mean I'd expect him to take his potshot with his blaster if he -could- and I know he could land a headshot and one shot me. But if I got out safely, if that meal was just sitting there, the choice of that meal or certain death - is that a legal choice to make, to take 'mush communion'?</p>

                <p>I see two potential violations here: you admitting to being mush before anyone caught you, and Chao possibly accepting the deal. Even if the ship is going to end, a strict rule is to not play against your team. The first violation is a mush hurting the mush side, and the second violation would have been a human hurting the human side. However, if you are already caught as mush, you certainly could try to make a deal, but the human does not really have a choice.</p>

                <p>How caught does caught have to be? I'd been told that I was known to be mush. I answered that I didn't know of any way to prove being human. Things were so bad on that ship by that point that only 2 humans were actually communicating, and then one of those was killed. With one player left, and that one player well controlled and in a hopeless situation, it's still breaking the rules to say 'hey guy, it's hopeless, come have dinner' in a way that prevents them from being able to win?</p><p>If I play this game, at the very end when I have a good player I like and respect, do I really have to cut their throat if I lack the time to slowly take them 'my way'? It's actually -wrong- to render someone helpless, then 'abduct' them, with their knowledge if necessary because you have nailed things down to their only choices being a death over the next couple cycles (though a chance perhaps to catch me) or surrender to you? I like surrenders. 'Mercy on my terms' appeals.</p><p>Under the circumstances, I don't understand how I'm playing against my team. The mush that converted me was a fool in the methods used and died for it. No mush has died since. Many humans have. The end comes very soon, and it's a guaranteed human loss, with extreme unlikelihood of any surviving mush dying as the humans lose.</p><p>A human character's player, placed in an absolutely hopeless situation, is absolutely forbidden to accept mushification if given no other choice than a certain and soon loss? I understand, if I stand there and -let- him shoot at me, he has to take that choice. But if I don't, if I drop the choice in his room and flee, and he lacks movement points or action points and knows the end comes before he can log in again the next day - That player is breaking the rules to accept the choice?</p>

                <p>I have a diffrent opinon, I think it is this sort of play that makes mush great. Scheme trying to figure out who is mush. And fundamentally, you weren't playing against your team, it would be good for mush to mushify him. What he should have done is a bit more complicated imho.</p>

                <p>I don't think your announcing of being Mush in your circumstances are against the rules - it doesn't say hurt the Mush team. That seems a lot more harmless than people sporing in front of cameras or turning full Mush or what have you.</p><p>The question would be if Chao takes your offer, would that make his actions go against the human team? Right now it's a team of 1. If you flip it, if we have only 1 mush and the humans have the serum, if they know the mush and ask him/her to take the serum and that mush takes it willingly, would that be against the mush team?</p><p>I think ultimately that mush is a social game, and so the social relationships formed that play across boarders of forced tribes of mush &amp; human are really interesting, and I think that while it might violate the letter of the law, it follows the spirit of the game.</p>

                <p>I'd agree with Delzoup. You're acting perfectly well in character and you're helping your team. Chao knows that the game is lost. He's not hurting his team by accepting the offer; his team won't gain any glory by his further suffering.</p><p>Whatever it is, I'd certainly encourage such conversations whether or not they choose to take the offer. In both my games where I'm exposed as mush, I taunt or encourage people to join me. It makes fun dramatic banter, even after the game was lost. One of the reasons that I love going for crippling morale is so that I can offer them a chance to live by turning them into mush. None of them take the offer, but still, it's fun.</p><p>I wish there weren't any hard rules to what your team is.

                <p>Isn't voluntarily becoming mush the same as voluntarily taking the serum and becoming human which is very much against the rules? Isn't outing yourself as mush against the rules also? If giving up as a mush is wrong, then why should humans be allowed to give up and come to the dark side to save themselves? The reasoning behind not letting mush out themselves or take the serum was that a mush would NEVER give up. They want to infect you, they want to take over Sol and destroy all that they can... No matter what. So why would a human that has fought so hard against an invasion, voluntarily succumb to an evil alien infection even if all hope was lost? Why would you want to become the thing you despise most, the thing that will destroy your families, friends and the place you call home? Surely death would be sweeter than helping a force that will decimate everything you believe in and love? I know this isn't a movie, but how often in movies do those that have been infected let themselves die/suicide (yes I understand suicide is against the rules <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">) rather than turn into what they have fought so hard against? Aliens, zombies, horrible viruses etc.</p><p>The point I am trying to make is that the rules were based on the role-play of never giving up in the fight for Sol/Eden for both human and mush. If mush are not allowed to give up and take the serum on purpose, humans should not be allowed to give up and and turn into an alien just because what awaits them is less than desirable.</p><p>I do find your RP's very amusing and clever, but I think that it would be unfair and a double standard to allow Chao to eat the meal willingly. No doubt a unique situation and I think personally I wouldn't mind if you outed yourself at the very end just to torment the last human alive about the fact that his death was imminent and there was no escape. Maybe it could be made a rule/allowed that as an end game mush tactic, if the mush greatly outnumber the humans and a human victory is completely out of the question, the mush could go full out torment mode. Mock the humans for their abysmal efforts to destroy the mighty mush and coax them into a sense of false security with the chance/promise of becoming a mush themselves to save their hide. Instead of allowing them that, you trap them where you want them and exterminate them instead <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">. That would probably be hard to police though and the last thing I want to do is give our lovely SDF judges more work! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway just my rambling opinion! Hope it made sense, I am falling asleep at the keyboard <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">. I look forward to reading more of your funny RP stories though!</p>

                <p><cite>Isn't voluntarily becoming mush the same as voluntarily taking the serum and becoming human which is very much against the rules? Isn't outing yourself as mush against the rules also? If giving up as a mush is wrong, then why should humans be allowed to give up and come to the dark side to save themselves? The reasoning behind not letting mush out themselves or take the serum was that a mush would NEVER give up.</cite></p><p>No, its not the same. Mush is mush, human is HUMAN. These are different species, having different mind sets, fears, goals. Mush can be fearless, striving to get to objective like a mindless robot, but HUMAN is in the end just what it is - a vulnerable human being. And we all have fear for death, no matter what you think now, living in comfort. When you look death in the eyes, you start thinking whole lot differently.</p><p>In movies, yeah, we see brave and cocky guys sticking to theirs side like a heros and dieing with a smile on their face and undefeated look. But in reality, humans fear for their life, in reality, you would do anything to stay alive, youd be screaming and crying to spare your life, and in VERY rare occasions you'd be the one that sacrifices himself.</p><p>Making rules and forcing specific decisions in unique situations that form in this game because of its diversity is bad for the gameplay! Loosen it up a bit, chill and see where it leads, the less repetitiveness and railed scenarios, the better. VARIETY is essential for this game.</p><p>Having rules is fine, but sometimes you gotta let it slip and do what you wanna do to make it FUN. The game is about makind hard decisions, why take part of it away?</p>

                <p>Yeah, mush are more hivemind/tribal mentality. The glory system reflects that they're <em>proud </em>of killing themselves just to destroy the ship. To be 'cured' of their condition is an insult to them. They're happy to die if it means the ship is destroyed, because death is a win to them.</p><p>Humans are a lot more selfish. But I'd imagine turning into a mush is rather disgusting, so it makes sense to turn it down too.</p>

Maybe it could be made a rule/allowed that as an end game mush tactic, if the mush greatly outnumber the humans and a human victory is completely out of the question, the mush could go full out torment mode. Mock the humans for their abysmal efforts to destroy the mighty mush and coax them into a sense of false security with the chance/promise of becoming a mush themselves to save their hide.

I have a problem with *doing* that. I actually don't want to torment the helpless. If I can, I'm a clean kill kinda player. I'll mock those I percieve as bullies and I'll play tricks on those I see as having power over me, but I feel a very strong drive to protect those I see as being in my power. The more helpless I think they are, the more strongly I want to not hurt them. So 'forcing' conversion would be perfect for me.

Very clear, very pink, and very impossible to interpret in any other way but directly what it says. Ima go wash my eyes out with soap now, because that as a blanket rule burns them. It's a clear rule though, and makes it clear that there is *no way* any player could accept such a deal without breaking that rule, thus with my motives there's no reason for me to ever again offer such a deal. What a loss to playstyle choices and dramatic opportunities. That actually makes me like the entire game less, because if I choose to play it I am forced into situations where I must decide to be merciless to those truly helpless before me, because anything else I do will force them to choose to break game rules and/or merely be more psychological torment for them. Since I'm not saying it because I want to torment them, that makes me feel constrained unpleasantly in a part of my playstyle that's very important to me.</p>

It -could- have if they'd been different humans. But again - if they'd been different humans, I wouldn't have revealed when I did. Chao -did- try to kill me before the end, but I was watching the game, I saw him start to move and I avoided him and his scary triple blaster free shots. And that attempt to kill me came when there were only 3 survivors, only 1 of them human. I honestly believe I did absolutely no harm to my team - the only Mush that died did so because of how she converted me, and I wasn't even online until hours after that to know I'd been converted.</p>

                <p>This game is appealing for the fact that there are two saboteurs within the ship that are playing against the group. I expect the Mush to play ruthless doing anything they can covertly to sabotage the humans efforts. I could be having the best game ever and be within reaching Sol within a cycle... and if I get killed off by the Mush I would tip my hat to them and say "Good game" Because that's how the game is played. I really have no respect for people who out themselves or play against their team. If I wanted to play a game where everyone wins, I would just go masturbate instead.</p>

                <p>Dealing with the original question and post here. Your actions could been seen as suicide by admission of Mush and Chao should have killed you or tried after you confessed. Even if the team was just made up of one person, you, if you had died well, Mush lose and that hurts the "team". Chao harmed his team by letting you live.</p><p>This might seem "nitpicking" but really, if you're not having "fun" playing within the rules I'm not sure what to say. We don't make the rules nor can we change them. If you were reported the judges would have considered it was end game etc. but you can't count on that. I'm just here over seeing, the judges do the judging for the most part.</p><p>Just a side note, spacesuits and being Mushy don't give you an advantage or disadvantage when you've run out of o2. The deaths that follow are random.</p>

                <p>I always thought the don't screw your team was to, well, not screw your team. Plus, a MUSH acting non-MUSHy can spoil the game for those that want to have fun trying to figure out who the MUSH is.</p><p>Endgame is different though. By then, the game is sort of decided. However, in your example, the game WASN'T really decided. There was still a question of who the MUSH was. Also, if Chao had taken the offer, then he'd be screwing over the other two players. (And in a way that helped an opposing team, rather than, say, eating the last ration to prevent starvation or something.)</p><p>Think of it this way, there were 3 humans and 1 MUSH left. Yes, the humans were going to lose because they couldn't survive. However, they COULD try to eliminate the MUSH before dying. Which is at least a kind of victory.<br>If it was 1 MUSH and 1 human left, and you offer to convert them rather than kill them, that's a bit different. Still, as a MUSH, I'd make the offer. And then tell them to hold on as I needed AP first. And then kill them once I got that AP. Cause that's what MUSH do. Betray you. Better luck next time hunam. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mushed_1:" class="tid_ico"></p>
