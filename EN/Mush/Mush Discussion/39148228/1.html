                <p>When you check the bios of different characters you will notice that some characters apper multiple times. This could give us hints what new characters we can await in the future. <br>Derek was mentioned before multiple times before he was introduced. For Andie, well, every famous seargant needs his fan girl.</p><p>So, here are some of my theories and what characters they might replace.</p><p><strong>Captain Baranov</strong>: He was the captain from the SFD that should replace Jin-Su after he refuses to make a report about the Magellan Project. In the prime timeline he was assinated by Chao because it was clear to him that he was sended by the mush infected SFD administratives so it was very likely he was a mush himself. But since Chao is dead in the alternate timeline he could not kill Baranov which makes it very possible that Baranov forces Jin-Su to retire and take over the Daedalus. Therefore he replaces Jin-Su in the alternate timeline.</p><p><strong>Nils Carlsson</strong>: A famous professor who worked on the Mush and was the initial communication officer of the Daedalus until Gioele decided to dump him in favour of his daughter. In the prime timeline Gioele wants to replace Carlsson with his daughter and while crew refused first they had no other choice after Carlsson got ill and couldn't join the team. In the alternate timeline he don't get ill and/or Paola decides to stay behind to be with her boyfriend. He will replace Paola but since he is a scientist he will probably have biologist and there be a good researcher.</p>

                <p>I'm hoping that in the next episode we can play both timelines and can either choose which timeline we want to play (that will probably be a gold member feature like in D2N choosing a new citiy) or you get randomly a timeline to play. Would make the game more dynamic because you can have different chars on different ships (instead of having one layout of chars in the whole episode).</p>

                <p>Yeah, that's pretty close to what I had in mind, especially tracker as first skill and sprinter as third. Maybe Botanist, too, for the extra fruit yield.</p><p>Confounding Luck is close to something else I was thinking about--"Outdoorsman" or something, which doubled the chance of getting positive zones, sorta like an anti-traitor. Since that wouldn't have a guaranteed effect, though (what with only changing likelihood), something like that would be better.</p>

                <p><strong>Captain Baranov</strong></p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Captain Baranov was a replacement for Jin Su, send by The Federation. While in the "main" timeline he was killed by Chao as mush, in our version he was fast enough not to be caught. Captain Baranov finishes first Chao, then Jin Su, and they both happen to be mush agents themselves, faking the evidence.</p><p>Note: Even if by background it looks like Baranov cannot be a mush, he actually can when the game starts. Xeloph-17 can be full with traps after previous mush agents, so he could became one before they took off.</p><p><strong>Role:</strong> Captain Baranov is the first commander of the ship. He mostly replaces Chao, as a lot of him skills are focused in dealing with mushes.</p><p><strong>Trait: To run away very fast...</strong>. His arrival has shocked everyone in the team. While they understand, they were actually lucky with mush agents killed, it's very hard to be close to Captain Baranov. Nobody can flirt with him and everyone in same room loses 1 morale on cycle change.</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong><br>1) Shooter<br>2) Lighting reflexes - When any aggression action is made against Baranov there is 75% chance he will strike back. If Baranov has at least 1 ap he will try to hit the attacker with his blaster, then knife, then fists (other weapons are not good for reaction shoots). If he hits the attacker, his aggressive action will be failed. He cannot counter action he cannot see like transfer or spiking in a room without a camera.<br>3) Equalizer - Captain Baranov starts the game with his custom blaster gun, called Equalizer. It has 3-5 damage, max 4 charges and make more wounds then normal blaster. Others has just 25% to hit with this unusual weapon, when Baranov has 50%. Also it gives +2 to expedition strength.<br>4) Torture<br>5) Survivalist<br>6) The Dreaded - Sending mission becomes a free action. Accepting mission gives +5 ap instead of +3 ap. Nobody wants to fail The Dreaded and should understand what he wants as fast as possiable...</p>

While in the "main" timeline he was killed by Chao as mush, in our version he was fast enough not to be caught. Captain Baranov finishes first Chao, then Jin Su, and they both happen to be mush agents themselves, faking the evidence.</p><p>Note: Even if by background it looks like Baranov cannot be a mush, he actually can when the game starts. Xeloph-17 can be full with traps after previous mush agents, so he could became one before they took off.</p><p><strong>Role:</strong> Captain Baranov is the first commander of the ship. He mostly replaces Chao, as a lot of him skills are focused in dealing with mushes.</p><p><strong>Trait: To run away very fast...</strong>. His arrival has shocked everyone in the team. While they understand, they were actually lucky with mush agents killed, it's very hard to be close to Captain Baranov. Nobody can flirt with him and everyone in same room loses 1 morale on cycle change.</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong><br>1) Shooter<br>2) Lighting reflexes - When any aggression action is made against Baranov there is 75% chance he will strike back. If Baranov has at least 1 ap he will try to hit the attacker with his blaster, then knife, then fists (other weapons are not good for reaction shoots). If he hits the attacker, his aggressive action will be failed. He cannot counter action he cannot see like transfer or spiking in a room without a camera.<br>3) Equalizer - Captain Baranov starts the game with his custom blaster gun, called Equalizer. It has 3-5 damage, max 4 charges and make more wounds then normal blaster. Others has just 25% to hit with this unusual weapon, when Baranov has 50%. Also it gives +2 to expedition strength.<br>4) Torture<br>5) Survivalist<br>6) The Dreaded - Sending mission becomes a free action. Accepting mission gives +5 ap instead of +3 ap. Nobody wants to fail The Dreaded and should understand what he wants as fast as possiable...</p></cite><p>Decently cool concept, though you would need two characters if you are replacing both Jin and Chao with him.</p><p>Some thoughts:</p><p>1. Lightning Reflexes should be penalized by Pacifist and other similar abilities. (When firing a gun, it should also use a shooter point instead of PA)<br>2. I would say his level 6 ability should cost the target 1 morale. After all, he rules through fear!<br>2.b. Similarly, his "Dreaded" should only give 3 PA to mush. After all, Mush don't know fear. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>3. The Equalizer should not function properly for Baranav if he is mush.

I would like if it had a reduced chance of hurting Baranov though (perhaps instead of the bonus, or a slightly smaller bonus), since it's often the fumble-injuries that wreck people with shooter, and why wrestler and solid are considered more reliable with the same amount of damage.</p><p>I could see him becoming the new griefer pick with his trait though, picking him to stand in the Dorms to piss people off, and then lightning reflexes to make him a freaking hassle to kill. The trait is interesting, like a reverse "antisocial", but might not work out in-game.</p><p>To Jamini's thoughts:</p><p>Thought # 2 - It's an interesting thought, I sorta like it.<br>2. b. - They can be intimidated (Chao's skill) though. Maybe, maybe not.</p><p>Well, it might make sense as a balance measure since this character would be quite scary as Mush as-is. I mean, he could enter a Dorm and kill everyone, then head over to the other one close to cycle change to speed up the suicide cascade...</p><p>Thought # 3 - Naw, then he would be as easy to be detected as Mush as everyone with the Solid skill is. Unless you mean that he just loses his bonus - but even then it makes little sense since the Mush gains all the knowledge and muscle memory from it's host as long as it's in there.</p>

                <p><strong>Takuariri Kitakika</strong><br>(replaces Eleesha Williams, can be with either Finola+Chao or Andie+Derek, it does not matter)</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Eleesha escapes from SDF surveillance on 3150 and manages to sneak in to an official office at Valparaiso. There she discovers incriminating documents proving that a Mush alert was declared on the 4th of January 3150 within the federation itself. According to these figures, the number of infected and the spread of the disease is dizzying, and President Maubrick is clearly involved. She tried to tell everyone what she has found, not realizing, it was too late. A lot of specialists were send after her and one of them succeed. On 3152 just before Eleesha tried to escape to Xeloph-17, she was found and killed by Takuariri Kitakika, an assasin, using traditional ninja techniques.<br>After discovering her plans about Xeloph-17 she was given another mission - to infiltrate Xeloph-17 herself and learn what is really going there. The initial infiltration was a success, but truth about mush invasion make her reconsider her loaylty and escape with others (or maybe not, if she happen to be A-mush, it was just another lie, to get to the last humanity ship and to do what she is taught to do best - assasinate everyone there).</p><p><strong>Role:</strong> As human she is mush hunter, having skills both for investigation and killing, but has quite no skills for regular specialist dutes. But her trait makes some tactics (like using scooter for investigation) impossiable. As mush she can use both her sneaking and killing skills very nice, but most of the weapons or armor will not be able to help her.</p><p><strong>Trait: <br>Way of ninja</strong> - Leaving and entering a room without cameras and/or humans is privite action instead of public and she is not marked on the map. But she cannot use some items (she can pick them up, hold or hide, but they don't work, like if they were broken): Armor, Spacesuit, Blaster, Natamy Rifle, Lizaro Jungle, Old Faithful, Grenade, Rocket Launcher, Scooter, Rolling Boulder.</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong><br><strong>1. Sneak</strong><br>(But it will require another description, not "You are of a fearful nature..." )<br><strong>2. Tracker</strong> <br><strong>3. Master assasin</strong> She ignores effects of Armor, Hard Boiled mush skill, Pacifist aura, Ceasefire action, Crazy eyes and Sneak human skills when attacking.<br><strong>4. Detached Crewmember</strong><br><strong>5. Observant</strong><br><strong>6. From the shadows</strong> If Abandoned event (patrol ship/planet) happens to her or if she gets Death outcome in Seismic, Volcanoes or MIA zone instead of dying, she returns to Daedalus somehow after 1-4 cycles and appear in random room. NERON does not announce her death at all, nobody loses morale. All items she was holding are lost, she get back with just walkie/tracker/itracker. Can happen only once per game.</p>

                <p><strong>Empathy Fofalla</strong></p><p><strong>Appearance</strong> - A frail, frantic black woman dressed in drab, dishevelled clothing. The clothes look like they might have been quite elegant and smart... once. She is laden down with cameras, microphones, recorders, antennae, trackers...</p><p>Empathy Fofalla's duties fall somewhere between comms work and mush hunting. Due to the loss of Gioele and Paola Rinaldo, and the arrival of Viktor Carlsson, Empathy fills in the the void left by Gioele's loss of <strong>Paranoid</strong> and also Paola's loss of <strong>Logistics</strong> and <strong>Radio Expert</strong>. Her other two abilities are interesting in that they help hunt the Mush, but require a degree of coordination to use.</p><p>Not to mention, an intelligent and observant mush can usually work out what's going on when someone who is usually supposed to be on the Bridge comes down to their Dorm and everybody slowly starts clearing out.</p><p>To make use of her Feed Freak ability requires some careful positioning for full effect.</p><p>When the Mush are taken care of and the comms work is done, she replaces Gioele as a pretty hardcore generalist, her IT Expert ability giving her the ability to hack should the Commander be slow, advance leftover research and projects, or help in planet scanning.</p><p>Replaces Paola Rinaldo</p><p>Unique Trait: <strong>None</strong></p><p><strong>Glory:</strong> <br>I knew it! I knew it!: +5 Glory <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> for each Mush killed with a bug on them.</p><br><p><strong>Skills</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Paranoid</strong> - Empathy is laden with cameras as a natural state of being. With the replacement of Gioele Rinaldo with Viktor Carlsson, it is up to Empathy to be the hostile nutjob on the ship.</p><p>2. <strong>Radio Expert</strong> - A fervent listener and follower (perhaps too fervent) of Paola Rinaldo, Empathy went into Communications in a big way.</p><p>3. <strong>Logistics Expert</strong> - Being the head of her University's conspiracy uncovering club, movement, forum, blog and protest group, Empathy is no stranger to coordination.</p><p>4. <strong>Feed Freak</strong> - Empathy watches all the doors at all times and has no shortage of gadgets. She can see where people are going to/from so long as she was in the room at the time; and has a chance to detect covert actions with a 25% chance. However, she cannot search for free like Eleesha's observant skill. In addition, when she opens the PM window, she can see how many tabs each individual person has open, but cannot tell who these tabs are with.</p><p>5. <strong>IT Expert</strong> - Carrying so many gadgets and gizmos around, it's no surprise she knows how to use them! In addition to helping her with comms work, when the Mush and research/projects are all done, she can use her IT expertise to help with Planet Scanning or Hacking.</p><p>6. <strong>Bug</strong> - for 2AP plant a recording device as a secret action on someone. This device lasts 2 cycles before expiring. In the meantime it reveals all private or secret actions the person commits. If a Mush notices that their private/secret actions are revealed before they do anything truly damning, it may stall them for a cycle or two. Given this is a secret action, Empathy shouldn't place the device on someone who is sleeping in a full dorm.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>3139 - Born in Durban, South Africa</p><p>3140 - At the tender age of 11, as a child in South Africa, she gets into trouble twice in the same year by sending bogus messages via local trucker radio and exposing corruption in the Mexican Government.</p><p>3148 - Entering University at the University of San Lorenzo, she becomes an avid listener of <strong><em>Paola Rinaldo</em></strong> and <strong><em>Kivanc Terzi</em></strong> 's radio broadcasts, which instils fear in her and leads her to turning her developing skills to uncovering the truth about the government, although after a while she stops listening to their broadcasts when the pair joked about a particular caller who used a variety of 'codenames' that kept sending in outlandish and bizarre theories. It's at this point she founds her conspiracy seeker's society.</p><p>3149 - Empathy hacks into the Government database, using funds she'd acquired as a hacker to power her monstrous computer and programs. She expected to find President Maubrick was a lizard in disguise. What she finds out isn't too far from the truth...</p><p>3150 - Having exhausted her funds, and seeking to further fund her 'truth-seeking' exploits, she participates in a competition on Bacchus IV under an assumed name to win the coveted <strong><em>Redmoon Prize</em></strong>. Unfortunately, she comes second place.</p><p>3152 - Eleesha Williams brings Empathy Fofalla onto Xyloph, having been made aware of Empathy's... blog. Though she doesn't respect Empathy's credentials as a fringe journalist, her technical skills and communications mastery are not to be denied!</p><p>3154 - Empathy enters cryostorage after a mad scramble to erase the footage which depicts Derek/Chao murdering Captain Baranov.</p>

                <p>You know, I kinda like the idea of Kivanç coming onboard, perhaps acting as a Mush-snooper to replace Eleesha. It could make it so that he and Paola gain more Morale for doing it with each other, and give them a Morale penalty if the other dies. Even if one was Mush and the other wasn't, it would still be heartbreaking.</p>

He thinks, that he is the best programmer and hacker of the century - some kind "Computer Guru" or even "God". He feels well only with computer, and will better die, then go to exlore new planets. Also he is sure, that without him the crew will go back to stone age in no time, will use ancient tools like knifes instead of blasters and ropes instead of grav fields...stop they already do, we are so doomed...</p><p><strong>How happended on the ship:</strong> On 3151, when Janice tried to optimize NERON's thinking processes it turn to a catastrophy. All base systems, connected to NERON gone completely mad until humans were able to manually shut it down, while Janice was killed by security system. They decided to invite Carlee Eno, a well-known specialist (mostly in organizations of hackers) to deal with that crisis. It was a risk nobody really wanted to take - nobody knew him, and were not sure if he can be trusted, Raluca was against somebody hacking her creation as well, but they really had no choice.<br>Carlee used a totally different way to make NERON do what he wants - not with physiology, but brute force. It left NERON unstable, fighting for his freedom against humans in every situation, when installed protocols had any weaknesses, but still - it worked and allowed to get more information from NERON. <strong>Carlee replaces Janice on the ship.</strong></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Changes on the ship:</strong> Every cycle there is a risk, that NERON will change on one setting to a random. Also Inhibit DMZ-CorePeace is locked on = NO and cannot be changed. Chance of scramble is 0% before mush selection and then = current day number. So on D10 it's 10% to happen every cycle.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_comp.png" alt=":mush_pa_comp:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Trait:</strong> Above all that - Carlee cannot take part in any expeditions. He gets status "Locked in the ship" if he was in Icarus, when expedition started.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/freeticket.png" alt=":mush_ticket:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Titles:</strong><br>Commander ~10 (after Roland, before Raluca)<br>NERON Admin ~1 ( 0 as he likes to say)<br>Comm manager ~17 (after Frieda, before Chao)</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Glory: +1 glory for each time, you returned bios settings to normal during the cycle, when they were scrambled</strong></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/tip.png" alt=":mush_tip:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Skills:</strong> <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/tip.png" alt=":mush_tip:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>1. Omnibenevolence</strong><br>New action (can be used once per journey) - Print a mage book<br>For 1 ap can print any mage book of his choice using Tabulatrix on the bridge.</p><p><strong>2. IT Expert</strong></p><p><strong>3. Omniscience</strong> <br>New passive: NERON announcements become more detailed, some new announcements are added.<br>- Hunters arrive: number of hunters of each type came, number of hunters of each type around the ship<br>- O2, fuel tank broken - in which room<br>- Shower dismantled - in which room<br>- (New) Asteroid will hit next cycle<br>- (New) Research done<br>- (New) Any item was dismantled<br>- (New) Plant died (lack of water or fail cross-breed)<br>- (New) Electro spike happened<br>- (New) Steel plate has fallen</p><p><strong>4. Omnipotence</strong><br>New action (can be used once per cycle) - A-true hack<br>For 1 ap manually changes A-true protocol. He selects a person in same room, select title. The person is now placed on top of chain of command for the title and will receive it next cycle.<br> <br>New action (mush only) - Journey to the void<br>If all humans are dead, while Carlee is a mush, NERON does not kill mushes on cycle change. Carlee can ask NERON to do it manually any time, by using this action, or mushes can play on their own as long as they keep Carlee alive. Of course this action is locked while any human is alive.</p><p><strong>5. Omnipresence</strong><br>New action (unlimited use) - Telepresence.<br>For 1 ap he begin to watch any room he wants using NERON sensors. He can see room logs, items on the shelf, crewmembers status. He cannot search to room or do anything. Also he reveal secret action done in the room (if they were done while he was watching), but he does not reveal secret actions in the room he really is.</p><p><strong>6. Genius</strong></p><p><strong>Role:</strong><br>As human:<br>Carlee supports the ship in general, but don't do some kind of special work. He can print any book for a crew (very likely they will ask Shrink, as Janice is missing), but it depends on situation - maybe you do need pilots or techs even more, maybe you have Shrink book from start or Xeloph. Or maybe you want to make Medic+Polyvalent+Devotion Andie for lighting speed research. He can give titles to anyone he wants - like making Chun-commander, who will never leave landing party, or making Caffeine Jerky Gioele a better comm manager, then his daugher. And IT expert is good for resets in different work. Telepresence can also be useful in mush hunt. Watching engine/Icarus and catch traps there, watch rear corridor/bays to watch spore extraction. Just checking rooms, that are far away or if visiting them is suspicious (like Raluca's room).</p><p>As mush:<br>You can get the book you want. Tech to deal with showers, Diplomat to have 3 more cycles (6 more ap) for fun, or just not giving humans Shrink, when they want it most of all. Telepresence is very strong to locate anything, that humans have forgotten to take, hold or hide without leaving any logs in target room. Playing with titles can be useful as well, but can be countered by vigilent humans in most of situations, as happen not immediately, but on cycle change. And don't forget - you can switch bios as you want, telling it was scrambled itself again, or just don't fix bios problems in time!</p>

                <p>Again I have nothing to do - my buddies are busy now, so we cannot roleplay. I don't have enough ideas for a guide, but I want to write ...soooo I'll post one more character here. Actually 2 characters.</p><p><strong>Tom Howard and Ron Howard</strong></p><p><strong>Replacement</strong>: Hua and Roland. Our dear pilots could not join Daedalus team. Hua was not that lucky on one of her most dangerous expeditions, and Roland could not escape prison, after being declared as deserter on 3151. But still they need pilots badly, so they others - quite young twin brothers - Tom and Ron, who just finished the academy. While you cannot call then ace jet pilots, Jin Su was very interested in their other talents for dealing with possiable mush agents in his crew - they are quite skilled in limiting suspect activity without killing or hurting anyone. Also they have quite unique ways for expeditions and piloting.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Glory objective</strong><br>Both brothers share the same objective: <br><strong>Better then you</strong> - both of them want to prove, he is better, then the other. When game ends and all glory is calculated, the one, who got more glory then another gets another +10 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ep2.png" alt=":mush_ep2_1:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Trait - Twin brothers</strong> <br>1) When one of brothers dies, another one loses 4 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_pmo:" class="tid_ico"> (instead of 1) and every day change from now on loses 1 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico"> more morale (2 per day if ship has MOH, 3 per day without MOH)<br>2) All characters see quite no differences between brothers and often are mistaken about who is who. They see "One of Howards" instead of Tom/Ron in room logs, public chat or privite chats where both brothers are invited. You still can invite only one in privite chat, and you see who is in same room as you. Brothers see their names normally of course.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/freeticket.png" alt=":mush_ticket:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Skills - Tom</strong></p><p><strong>1. Pilot</strong></p><p><strong>2. Survivalist</strong></p><p><strong>3. Guardian</strong> - Guard action has a changed effect for Tom. When he guards a room, you can do nothing there - you cannot access terminals, hide, pick up objects and so on. What you can do: go back from room you came from, do any aggressive actions against Tom (but not against any other character), drop objects. Sneak still supress any those effects.</p><p><strong>4. Flight instructor</strong> - While Tom is piloting partol ship or is on the bridge, all people without pilot skill has -50% to cause any trouble with landing/take off and has 60% basic chance to hit a hunter instead of 40%. Still they need NERON permission.</p><p><strong>5. Shooter</strong></p><p><strong>6. Scars of the MAN</strong><br>Facing an illness or injury (not disorder) only makes Tom tougher. After he is cured from those, he gets bonuses:<br>1: Can self-heal without medkit/medlab. Still 3hp for 3ap.<br>2: Can lift heavy objects with penalties<br>3: "Kick them out" option is unlocked<br>4: +1 unarmed damage (from now on, copies Solid completely)<br>5: -1 damage taken (like armor)</p><br><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ticket.png" alt=":mush_ticket_1:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Skills - Ron</strong></p><p><strong>1. Pilot</strong></p><p><strong>2. Solid</strong></p><p><strong>3. Gunpoint.</strong> - If Ron has a blaster/natami/old faithful/lizardo with 1 charge, he can take any human in same room at gunpoint for 1 ap. This action is aggressive. Holding anyone on gunpoint ends like lying on the bed - by any your actions, or when anyone attacks you. If targeted human does nothing - nothing happens. If he perform any action (he will also get a message with warning), he will be shoot. This shoot has 100% chance to hit, does weapons max damage and has x5 chance to be headshot (stackes with shooter for x10 chance). Shooting happends before the action - for example if he transfers, he has very real chance to die before transfer will happen.</p><p><strong>4. Challanger</strong> <br>- Adds +2 to expedition strength.<br>- Negative outcomes during expeditions are replaced by combats, if that zone has combat. Be ready for combat, and you will lose less.<br>- Triggers after Diplomat, if Diplomat is tring to change Combat into something bad, Diplomat can still cancel combat to get something good.<br>Examples: Insects-Accident into Combat, Intelligent Life-Item lost into Combat, Mankarogs-Death into Combat.</p><p><strong>5. Shooter</strong></p><p><strong>6. Suicidal landing</strong> - While most of skilled pilots say landings like that cannot be done and Ron is still alive just because of luck, he think differently. <br>Starting expedition cost 2ap instead of 4ap, and Ron and choose any known zone on the planet to start expo.</p>

                <p>First of all, It was a random Idea, It certainly has a few things and issues to be worked...</p><p>In fact he is an alternative to Terry thinking it throught, the idea was creating a Tech character more focused on fighting, originally It woud have Pilot, Shoter and maybe wrestler, bu dumped 'em in favor of Warrior, which idea was, without being a fighter class char, have a chance to help and to avoid getting hurt during fights... Maybe add more percent or return to the PSW Idea? In any case I'll accept that Robotics Expert is almost a trait for Terrence, let's dump it.</p><p>On the Brutus thing, He will be able to carry only 1 object at a time, will have no heavy penalty, it's a machine afterall made for war and using <em>heavy weapons</em>. The idea off the chanel... let's do this, there will be a Brutepad that will grant acces to it and to give orders throught it, yet certain orders will be only given by Jorek or the next authorized (the kill order for first). He can control only Brutus not drones... If Joreks killed then will be a reassigment to use of BrutePad in hyerarchy. If no one gives orders, Brutus may hunt hunters, repair things etc like a drone, yet avoiding useless places. Thats the TechnoSpore of mush, also the attack order cannot be fixed to a char its general, the drone or Brutus will began attacking the nearest char, even thw spiking mush!</p><p>Fungic Scan will give a percent on how much fungus are in someones body, i.e. being the normal above 10%, 1 spore 25%, 2 50%, 75%, and mush theorically 100%. Yet the values will be inexact, 13% 24,5% etc and it will ted to round up, causing what will appear a false positive. Also it can't give more than a 90%.</p><p>Protect will work not guarding, but instead if the protected is attacked Brutus will take the damage and hit back, also alert of an attack.</p><p>Efficiency looks a bit Op, But I'll keep Efficient.</p><p>His position on hierarchy will be determined by the building of Brutus, but yeah he will be down, near the bottom. His personal objective will be developing brutus by stages, the more stages, the more glory, the more Brutus extra capabilities.</p>

But I will avoid any religious rituals here, I will not name any religion in particular either, anyone will be able to roleplay anything he likes, maybe - from modern, maybe imagine something completely new, that was inverted in 31th century. Be sure in one thing - Maximilian really cares about all others - about their health, about their morale and about mush spores spreading and he takes the situation on the ship much more personally them most others (well, maybe as much as Janice). <br>Also I wanted to use some game mechanics, that I really wish to use on my ships:<br>- ability to get people from beds without attacking them<br>- ability to cure disorders without Shrink (or too random pills and fruits)<br>- a character, where Self Sacrifice can be useful<br>- ability to feel the situation on the ship - no collect to evidence like Tracker or print the List, but to have overview of it<br>Role and abilities:<br>Maximilian helps his team to stay healthy. He can heal them, help them with morale, provide some ap/mp for those who cannot take beds. Also he can work in lab, but still is less powerful then Finola, Andie or Ian in that. He also helps in investigation, but indirectly.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/tip.png" alt=":mush_tip:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Personal objectives</strong> <br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Serenity:</strong><br>+4 glory for each day he got morale boost from his trait<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Livesaver:</strong><br>+4 glory when Ultra-Healing Pomade research is complete</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/fire.png" alt=":mush_fire:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Trait: Holy war</strong> <br>Maximilian feels how well things are going on the ship. Maybe he does not know what happened exactly, but he just knows if mushes or humans get advantage and if it is going to end well...<br>On day change Maximilian recieves a special message and morale boost or penalty.<br>-1 morale for each spore humans/cat got (direct spiking, trap, spored food, mush trap event)<br>+1 morale for each spore destoyed (trap triggered by mush/Chun, spored food eaten by Chun/destoyed, spores destoyed by super soap/spore sucker etc) <br>Spores eaten or vanished during transfer does not count. Just extraction does not count.<br>+1 morale for each mush killed<br>+3 morale for human cured with RFS<br>Humans turned to mushes don't cause extra morale lost, just regular -1 for third/fourth spore.<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/less.png" alt=":mush_less:" class="tid_ico"> If the sum is below -3:<br><em>You are losing control of the ship, mushes continue to spread in the dark corners and looks like nothing can be done.

Inspiration</strong><br>Allows new action: for 1 ap (0 ap if targeting an idle) Maximilian can inspire another crew member in same room for 3-5 cycles (3 for healthy crew members, up to 5 if they suffer psychological disorder, so it will be cured by one inspiration). The crew member will receive "Zeal" status with following effects:<br>If a crew member was in the bed, he will get up<br>+1 mp every cycle change<br>25% chance to get +1 ap every cycle change<br>25% chance to get +1 morale every cycle change<br>If crew member is affected by any disorder, every cycle under holy zeal status will count as staying in bed with Shrink for healing the disorder.<br>The effect will end, if crew member lie down, but he will be warned about this (like message when you take off for expo).<br>Mushes can be inspired, but receive nothing from that, they will be only forced to get up.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/tip.png" alt=":mush_tip:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>4. Salvation</strong><br>Passive effects on the ship:<br>- When a crew member dies, there is 50% chance for others not to lose morale.

Turned into a Private Investigator and eventually begun to investigate everything related to his expulsion, he also found about the intel the "fungus" controlled goverment had about Daedalus, so he went to give 'em the word about being discovered... Due to that the security officer and associate not returningfrom certain mission Jin Su took him on board in charge of security due to his past.</em></cite></p><p><strong><em>Skills</em></strong></p><p>1Inspection: each time he enters a room he automatically and at no cost inspects it in search of anomalies, thus giving him a 25% chance of uncovering a hidden object or secret action, he also has Inspect instead of search, at the same cost of search, 1 AP, which gives him a 25% extra chance of finding a hidden object or uncovering a secret action in the logs over normal search chance percent.<br>2Shooter<br>3Pilot<br>4Wrestler<br>5Wrought: due to his military training, the hard times as a PI, and his own personal history, Jim is very Steady and fightkin, giving him a 15% extra chance to dodging, a 25% chance to block half the damage or all if its only a 1 damage point attack, and a 15% chance of counterattacking whoever ataccked him. This applies both in the Daedalus against crewmembers as well in patrolships against hunters, yet in patrolship he can't negate damage, this skill is lost if he turns a mush, but the mush can choose another mush skill for free.<br>6Investigation: he can choose a crew member in the same room to investigate during 3 cycles for 6 AP, Jim will follow that crew member to anywhere he goes and cannot exit the room, yet still interact with items inside the room, i.e. consoles. His logs entries as entering or leaving the room will be secret until the end of the investigation. He also will know any secret action done by the crew member. His presence will not count for doing the thing. Nobody will be adverted of being investigated (unless you told him in the chat, of course). At the end of the investigation Jim will make an inform about that crewmember activities during the investigation, like a log, he can copy paste it to the chat. Once the investigation is ended, there is a 50% chance of Neron accusing Jim of being a pervert over x character investigated. Either that or Neron creatinga log 3 cycle later the investigation has ended about Jims activities during it, including secret actions but just telling "Jim is doing something secretly".</p><p><strong><em>Trait</em></strong></p><p>Can't decide on one.</p><p>Blood-Thirsty each time he kills another crew member he earns 3 morale, not penalty applied, If anyone dies he loses 2 morale instead of 1</p><p>Rought but Fertile due to his personal history with women it costs him 1 extra AP to flirt, but in exchange each time doing it provides with 4 morale points to both parts... and a 15% extra chance of Pregnancy.</p><p><em>Personal Objective</em></p><p>Vengeful Redemption each time a mush dies he wins 2<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico">, If imush is killed by Jim 3<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico">, for every 4 hunters he kills he earns 1<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>So many cool character ideas aaaaaaa<br>I do like the idea of a specialized drone... And I do think it should be a skill... But level 8 is a bit high for any character aside from mush, considering that characters are lucky to go up to six.<br>Also, just so you know searching a room with a hidden object in it will always find the last hidden object. Always. Now, the idea of being able to possibly find a concealed action at will is interesting too...</p>

                <p>Cheers for the advice. but whenever I play terrence I kinda get pressered to take technician or pilot. I was just getting to the idea that we could have like a Chao/Derek skill based character with some IT based skills combined. I just want find it hard to hunt mush when I'm expected to fix the ship, pilot a patrol ship and on top of all this I'm in a wheelchair.</p>

                <p>Hello forum goers this giant wall of text is a continuation of my previous character you can find by just looking a few posts up.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush.png" alt=":mush_mush:" class="tid_ico"><strong>Itchy Scratchy</strong><br>- An extreme reaction to the myco-particles in the air.<br>Character has a 2.5% chance to become dirty on cycle change while in the presence of spores. <em>which includes being on crew, mush, food, or trapped shelf</em><br>Character has a 4% chance to become dirty on cycle change from passing through a room that has had recent Mush activity.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If converted to Mush the trait becomes dormant.<br><em>I've reworded the description of this character trait to try be more clear and coherent.</em></p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><p>For Humans: <br>1. Depending on Childs activities may help give a general idea of where a mush has been or who might be carrying spores. However due to is low chances and the impreciseness it is not evidence in itself and can create false positives.</p><p>For Mush:<br>1. Paired with the skill Expert can increase the validity of often becoming dirty.<br>2. May aid in possible social engineering by falsely casting a shadow on other crew members you've passed by or areas they've recently visited. <em>Example: Let's say Roland has reported becoming dirty from eating a ration to kill some hunters. A Mush Childs can pass through the Refectory or the bay that the human Roland uses and on cycle change quickly become dirty to cast doubt on Roland's story by claiming he spored.</em><br>3. A Mush could choose to 'target' Childs by staying in the same room while carrying spores, planting a spore in the room or on a crew member, or sporing Childs directly.</p><p><strong>Drawbacks</strong></p><p>For Humans:<br>1. Childs has a greater chance of becoming dirty compared to the other crew which can limit participation on Neron and Research while increasing the AP usage on showering to stay clean.</p><p>For Mush:<br>1. Due to the fact that the trait is lost when converted a Mush that is trying to avoid becoming dirty may raise suspicion if seen in rooms with suspected Mush activity without becoming dirty on cycle change.<br>2. Even though Childs has a greater chance of becoming dirty doing so too often will still raise suspicion.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"><strong>Avrils Childs Role on the Daedalus:</strong><br>Although Childs has been compared to Andie I feel if you were going to make a comparison to any current character Hua would be more valid. Childs' skill-set in my eyes has two obvious builds depending on what is needed for the ship and the player's membership status. The first is quite obviously a Pilot that excels at expeditions with the core skills: <em>Pilot</em>, <em>Survivalist</em>, &amp; <em>Sprinter</em>. The second is a 'Handyman' that excels at risk based tasks through the whole ship with the core skills: <em>Sprinter</em> &amp; <em>Expert</em>. The rest of the skills and some Mage Books only serve to personalize these two builds.</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/freeticket.png" alt=":mush_ticket:" class="tid_ico"><strong>Effects on crew roles and ship normality:</strong><br><em>Disclaimer: These are estimations of how ships could adapt. No one can 100% predict what a whole community will do or foresee every complication.</em></p><p>- A Childs that chooses the Pilot skill becomes another contender for a dorm bed.<br>- A Childs that chooses the Sixth Sense skill will most likely be wanted in a dorm possibly along side Janice to maximize safety.<br>- Absence of Ian creates more incentive to change up who takes care of the plants depending on the ships situation.<br>- The Trait: Itchy Scratchy <em>may</em> help direct a torture Chao in the correct direction or on a goose chase.<br>- Bronze Hua may be expected to choose Botanist similar to how a bronze Janice is expected to choose Shrink.</p><p>Anyway I'm still open to feedback and hearing opinions. Even if we don't agree it's still fun to have a friendly discussion.<img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>

Just so you know where I am coming from, I don't actually care about what level any skill is for any character because all it takes is time to unlock all the skills. It's a goal to be working towards while you are playing and ultimately no matter how you spin it does not affect how powerful a skill is.</p><p>Although Sixth Sense and General Patching Up attempt to do a similar job they do have some pretty key differences. First, Sixth Sense has a chance to stop only one negative action that can happen in the room that Childs is standing in with no bias. Second, it does not provide ship wide protection and there is no guarantee that when it does work that it will stop the worse of the multiple negative events. And finally, it's not a skill that I would take on anything but a gold player and even then it's not for every voyage.</p><p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1850618 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1850618">Chime</span></span><cite>Your replacement for Ian who's <em>the gardener</em> and occasional research help, has only one garden-relevant skill and that is a level 5 Frugivore for 5xp. Caffeine Junkie as another AP gaining skill example still costs 55xp and is limited to 1-2 coffees a day until mush are dead. With Pilot + Expert you're not replacing a gardener but a Pilot.</cite> You are right that I could have picked a pilot to replace instead of Ian, but truth be told I built this character with one of the first core concepts around removing Ian from the ship. Shocking? Ian is built to be the gardener of the Daedalus and throughout most voyages may handle this job by himself possibly spending all of his AP on the plants depending on how big the garden gets. This is fine and for the most part there is nothing wrong about that. However adding new characters in alternate timelines allows roles that are set in stone normally to be skewed a bit and allows for a change of pace from the norm.</p><p>On the topic of Frugivore I have to say that it is far from being as powerful as Caffeine Junkie since you have to have Jumpkins to receive 5AP and 8 hydropots dedicated to yourself to even compete once Pilgred is complete. You also have to wait until all the plants are full grown and will have to share with the crew once the rations run out.</p><br><p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1850618 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1850618">Chime</span></span><cite>With that odd trait of yours he's unsuitable to help with research and turns into a huge problem child for being dirty all the time "because of his trait".... since he's no pacifist like Ian he'll be dead in 2 secs.</cite> I think you are really overestimating how much that trait would even come into play. Just as a reminder this season's gimmick has been crew starting with spores and that it probably won't continue after the season has ended. So it's something that could occasionally happen and has the added benefit of possibly localizing where Mush activity is. It may not even come into play every ship and adds a small amount of validity a mush that couldn't make it to the shower without being spotted without a good excuse or possibly used for social engineering.</p><p>Thank you for the response and I enjoyed discussing a few of the points you brought up. I hope that I explained the idea before Sixth Sense a bit more clearly.</p>
