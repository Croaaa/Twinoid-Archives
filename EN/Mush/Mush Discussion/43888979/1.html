                <p>I looked over mushpedia, and although I was glad to see there was a guide to playing as a mush, I could not find a guide to playing as mush depending on the character you chose (Ian mush, Roland mush, etc.). Therefore I suggest that we create our own character-specific guide to winning as a mush. Anyone who wants to post can just post under the heading of the character in question. Example:</p><br><p><strong>Ian</strong></p><ul><li>Take Fungal Kitchen as one of your skills. As you grow plants, infect them with 1 spores each, so that you can evenly distribute them among all the food.</li><li>If you are in Gold or Silver Mode, take sabotour so you have more time to plant spores.</li></ul><br><p>The above is just an example, and should not be taken literally. As people write tips on various characters, I'll include them into this first post for easier reading. You can give tips on characters that haven't been mentioned yet, add tips to the ones that already have been mentioned, or "debunk" false tips about characters so I'll remove them. Thanks.</p><br><br><p><strong>Frieda</strong></p><ul><li>Fail to mention planets that have oxygen, or tell the crew they have dangerous zones instead (Volcanoes, Mankrog).</li><li>If suspected, have your partner destroy oxygen tanks to draw attention away from the bridge and worsen the situation.</li><li>If you have transfer and it is nearing the end of the game (and you are very close to being discovered/killed), transfer into the body of the current commander and hide the hacker kit while taking a long and twisty route to Alpha Bay 2. Go into the Pasiphae and take off, securing your victory.</li></ul>

                <p>Well, I like when mush use techniques I did not know myself (or use them in situiation where I thought it was impossiable), but as a lot of mushes do nothing useful until revealed/do stupid mistakes for their team and ships happen to be auto-human-wins, sharing is good too.<br>But I don't think, that so many characters has very different mush play. Raluca is quite unique, Ian too, commander title give benefits, being tech is good to become dirty, but most of mushes are the same.</p>

                <p>I think if someone is giving "individual mush tips" then they are not individual anymore... <br>It is far more important that every mush knows what he should <strong>NOT</strong> do.<br>Some thoughts regarding that are already in mushpedia: <a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Mush_Play"></a><a href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Mush_Play" target="_blank">http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Mush_Play</a></p><p>Mush play does very much depend on whether you have an active partner. After that it depends on how many skill slots and which mush level you and your partner have.<br>Then it depends which human skills you have (some are helpful also for mushes, especially Technician, Diplomat, physicist, shooter and wrestler), how often your character or the character of your (active) mush partner has excuses to get dirty OR is able to get to bravo dorm, how ap-intensive your normal human job is, which you are expected to do and how active, knowledgable and skillful the real human team is.<br>If you considered everything above the mush team can think about their best <strong>individual strategy</strong>, depending on their <strong>individual situation</strong>, to defeat the human team.<br>If there are much chances to get dirty and create spores, then playing for conversion is a good way for example. If there are not much ways to get dirty and human team is incredible active, then a sacrifice for the hivemind might be necessary to cripple antimush research/monitoring, an early return to sol, a plot where it is possible to get without traces one knowledgable anonymush and sacrifice the other mushes to make the human believe they killed all mushes, or a mush rampage, which is eliminating all human key members.</p>

Plants are not like Schrodinger, where you can infect the plant and it will make infectious bananas every day - Schrodinger can be given an 'infectious caress', after which he forevermore is infected, cannot be cleansed even with the cure - and everyone injured picking him up or caressing him gains +1 spore without limits.</p><p>Fungal kitchen would let you put spores into bananas, and once all the pots are planted, the only way for spores to leave a banana are for it to be eaten or destroyed in a fire - unless Chun is a banana vacuum or the other mush love to nom, humans will get infected.</p><p>But the tip tells you nothing about how to safely produce the spores for that fungaling, what to do about mycoalarms that could be present, how to handle getting dirty making the spores...</p><p><cite>◾If you are in Gold or Silver Mode, take sabotour so you have more time to plant spores.</cite></p><p>Hard to use, because most items that break get messages at cycle change, only. Saboteur breaks things the moment used, you need to be in that same room to break it, and it breaks without creating broken message. Alert humans can use that difference to not only know there is mush activity, but then they just need to find the room with the unannounced broken thing is and use the roomlog to create a list of suspects who could have broken it. Also, sabotage usually costs a lot of AP - which you then don't have for infection or appearing human.</p><p>Super risky plan, though there are specialized scenarios where sabotage can be part of a mush win - usually not early on, and usually without keeping hidden in the process - it's often an endgame move, forcing the crew to have to choose to put limited AP resources into fixing the problems that existed before the mush moved, fixing the problems made by the mush, and killing the mush - with intense time pressure and a ship about to die so there is no time to just get more AP later.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">My advice to learn how to play well as mush, from others and while not a mush yourself:</span></p><p>Haunt the AP threads in the lounge. Read them carefully, especially for the mush side of things, and ask questions.</p><p>Also, while on your ships, talk to your fellow players. Try to identify the better players shipping with you and learn from them. The good ones are pretty darn active in trying to find mush and are watching for a wide range of possible mush plans, and can explain what they are looking for and how they are making it harder for the mush. This translates well into what a mush may be doing - and as you get better at the game, you can see how you might *not* want to play and see what a range of fairly good (or not) mush hunters have defenses against -and don't have defenses for, are not considering. <em>That's</em> where you hit them, of course.</p>

                <p>some ideas on Mush Frieda and Mush Paola:<br>both of those are expected to stay on the bridge under camera surveillance most of the game, which makes it harder to create spores and to infect (means you have to rely more on your mush partner)</p><p>they can easily stay under the radar if they don't go on rampage and instead do the job which the crew is expecting them to do. But there are subtle differences in how a mush does those jobs, compared to how human would do them.</p><p><strong>Astrophysics</strong><br>doing Astrophysics as a mush has some advantages and some drawbacks.<br>expeditions give the crew vital resources to survive longer. on the other hand death by asphyxation still take a long time. frequent expeditions both give an excuse for mush to become dirty (loading/checking fuel) and to spike someone (icarus bay is often not protected by cameras)</p><p>Human Astrophysicist will look out for the following two things: 1. Does the planet have needed resources (O2) 2. No Mankarogs, Seismic, Volcanoes on the planet</p><p>Mush Astrophysicist will have to look out for the same things (thats the only way to ensure that the expedition will take place) but they need to look out for 2 more things.<br>3. Reason for you or your mush partner to join the expedition (so they can enter IB in order to spike the target)<br>4. Reason for your target to join the expedition. (if you want to convert a specific person)<br>Botanist, Diplomat, Survivalist provide some bonuses to the expiditon if specific zones are present.<br>Sprinter, Pilot, Shooter give some general bonus to any expeditions they take part in.<br>the Commander is often expected to join the mission, so he can't abandon the expedition crew.</p><p>only tell the crew about an O2 planet if you can use this to your advantage (as excuse for becoming dirty or opportunity for spiking someone).<br>you always can say that the planet didn't have O2 or that it had Volcanoes/Seismic/Mankarogs.</p>

                <p>sry for double post, but i didnt want to get the post to become too long</p><p><strong>Communications</strong><br><strong>NERON Version</strong>: depends on your goal. additional NERON projects make the crew survive longer against the environment. so if you hope that the humans get killed by outside damage, avoid upgrading this. if your goal is to convert everyone, then this allows mush to survive longer too, so this doesn't give a big advantage to either side. Note that some projects provide infection vectors (e.g additional hydropots, which can be trapped with a spore before they get moved to lab)</p><p><strong>Rebel Networks</strong>: As a mush, you really don't want to finish those Bases, which provide Morale Boosts to the humans. Those are exactly the bases that everyone will yell at you for, if you don't manage to finish them in time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Trading</strong>: partner up with a mush wrestler/solid and sell unsuspecting crew mates?</p><p><strong>Xyloph</strong>: As a mush Paola/Eleesha you should put your focus mainly on Xyloph<br>Useful Xyloph Entries for Mush:<br><strong>Cook, Mage Books</strong>: Uncover the Mage Books as soon as possible. You also want to take an active role in distribution of those books.<br>- Biologist, Logistics Expert (if used in Medlab), Medic, IT Expert can be used by humans to speed up research, which can make life harder for you, so you want one of the mush to read those . fortunately as comms officer you have a good reason to read IT Expert, read Logistics (if you dont have that skill already) or have Frieda read it (so you can profit from the extra AP)<br>- Shrink is another mage book that should be read by mush. Prevents Humans from getting that precious extra morale AND gives the mush a reason to visit Finola/Raluca<br>- Extra Skills for Humans means more responsibilities for them, which in turn makes them move around more and gives more opportunities to spike them. Especially skills that make them more likely to work on projects (NERON often not protected by cams, to go on expeditions (IB often not protected by camera) or to take pilot duties (Pilot Bays often not protected by camera.<br>- Extra Skills for Mush means more excuses for becoming dirty or for visiting certain areas where you can spike humans.</p><p>Magnetite, Snow: Cause Comms link failure. if you time it right, then you can use this as an excuse for missing the day 5 and day 7 bases. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Blueprints: usefulness varies, you can trap the blueprints or use them as excuse for your Technician mush partner to get dirty, dismantling things.</p>
