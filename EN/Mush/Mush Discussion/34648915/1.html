Those people, who are idle sure wouldn't be idle, if they had paid money - but those who did are the ones suffering because of that.</p><p>Here are some possible solutions for this problem:</p><p>1. Report the game for being fruitless:</p><p>This one is difficult and leaves room for exploiters since it would be needed for the active minority to have priority over the inactive majority. The system would need to take into consideration the number of actions made by each character, eventually even the amount of posts (also exploitable) and give those the most active the most voting power on the report.</p><p>2. Commit Suicide:</p><p>A character should be able to actively commit suicide under certain circumstances (for example if morale is less that 5). This wouldn't work with Mush, though and different characters would need different waiting times until they can do that.</p><p>3. Manual control:</p><p>A player can report the game afterwards and a mod would have to manually check the game logs for whether or not the reporting player is telling the truth. If yes, the time used should be added to the account of all who reported.</p><p>This is a complex issue and it would require a lot of attention to find a really suiting solution, but when the matter is money, it is just necessary for it to be solved.

The inactives problem is a very difficult one to solve, and while it's great that people have a number of suggestions, a lot of people come up with suggestions without taking adequate thought into how much these ideas can be exploited. If someone comes up with a proposal that definitely took a lot of serious thought, isn't too convoluted, and cannot be easily exploited, maybe the developers will consider implementing the idea.</p><p>We've all heard of some variation of separating players. The admins have tried that and found it did not work. Anything that involves some numerical threshold is very likely to be exploitable. Finally, the SDF works hard enough as it is handling complaints, and we already know how hard it is to get the admins to do something on demand, so try to avoid ideas that involves more manual intervention.</p>

                <p>Community jumps are a good solution to getting on ships with less inactives, although it does leave the in between jumps with less active players to fill them, which is a pity.</p><p>Best advice I can give is go into mush irc chat and find someone else who is joining a new ship, and try to land on the same ship as them. It takes a bit of coordination and luck, but if you succeed, at least then you know there's one person who will be active and communicative. Also, jumping around the time when it's guaranteed to be a new day has given me pretty good results on any day of the week, as that is the time when gold players and people who know what they're doing will tend to jump, time zones permitting.</p>

We do not want to sanction new players who might not be engaged. Learning to work around these players is part of our game. You *can* succeed on as ship that has many deaths and/or a fair number of inactive players. Luck and team work amongst those left will be in order but it can be done.
