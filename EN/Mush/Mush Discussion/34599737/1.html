                <p>I'm sorry if this comes off as ungrateful towards the devs, or if this is the wrong place for me to post this. Consider this my last complaint/suggestion before i go off to enjoy what is becoming a very fun game! (despite some flaws that I hope can be addressed at some point)</p><p>A quick browse through some recent threads shows a re-occurring sentiment, that the demo/tutorial being part of actual players games (and the resulting braindead crew), is frustrating and -not fun-.</p><p>These threads all end up "resolved" but I see no resolution? Or does "resolved" really just mean shut up about it.. Please do not be like those who insist on calling a spade a shovel. This doesn't have to be the place for the discussion, but please look into it a little further. You -cannot- punish or prevent throwaway braindead accounts through reporting. Even a simple confirmation e-mail would cut down on many problems. It is also worth re-examining, and discussing, if incorporating the demo/tutorial (first exposure to actual game and mechanics) into other dedicated (and in some cases paying) players games is really wise.</p><p>You can teach mechanics in an offline ship (there is even potential to recreate the emergency escape jump in some form of tutorial, slightly different for each crew member- and add some fun lore!) I enjoy the random aspect of who my crew will be, but I want them to be random people who -want to play this game- (even if for whatever reason events prevent them from doing so later on).</p><p>Tickets are not the answer to this particular problem, reporting is not the answer either. I hope you guys can consider this further, will be the last time I start a thread over it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

I didn't explain very well why I locked it though. I'm sorry it was made more clear and I hope this helps explain it.<br><br>If you've indeed read those threads that suggested tutorial ships you would notice that this type of idea goes against Motion Twin's vision for the game. <br>Like I said <a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/Q0yV0g/290">here.</a>:<br><cite>This is been decided and dealt with in the French community. I will say this again, inactives and new comers aren't a problem that needs fixing it is an intended mechanism you as players are meant to deal with on your ship. There will be no segregation of players into tutorial ships, this is separating the player base and Motion Twin is against it.</cite><br>As you can see, I've said it more than once. So, threads that devolve into this type of sentiment will get locked, often with me saying the same thing at the end of it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> They are locked because they often don't offer solutions and are generally insulting to new players.<br><br>Making a new thread to ask a moderation question isn't necessary. There are also ways to contact a moderator regarding a locked thread or moderation, there's the <a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/0MDL0g">Ask the SDF!</a> thread and <a target="_blank" href="http://twinoid.com/tid/groupDiscuss">Mush Moderators</a>.<br><br>edit:spacekadt ninja'd ty spacey!<br><br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"><br>I'm adding to my response to clarify and add Peanutz' comments here. Because, some seem to focus on the "intended feature" bit of what I said and it might look like it's something Motion Twin wants to see on ALL ships or something, this isn't the case. They don't begrudge very active ships. <br><br><span class="tid_user tid_user_516 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="516">Peanutz</span><br><cite><strong>They're not exactly intended. What the devs said repeatedly is that they are inevitable, but that they don't make the game impossible to play, as some people pointed out here. It is possible to last 7 days, kill the mush, do explorations and other things, and go back to Sol with only 5 active people.</strong></cite>Inactives are inevitable, Motion Twin's intention is that we work around inactivity.

                <p>It's also one of those things that would prevent someone from re-subscribing, and getting friends to try/promoting through word of mouth.. If this is an old issue, a part of me feels keeping it this way could be some misguided attempt to inflate perceived player base? (I mean, who else still doesn't require even a confirmation e-mail, in this day and age)- which is better than an alternative of stubbornness, pride, or laziness I guess..</p><p>I don't wish to beat a dead horse or be inflammatory, though maybe if enough people make similar (and what I thought were reasonable and unbiased) arguments they will re-examine.

                <p>Editing to add: A solution to change the mechanic isn't a solution as it's been stated already that Motion Twin has no intention of implementing that suggestion.</p><p>Yeah, they are intended, and thank you for the sincere question, really. I've been trying to find a way to make this more obvious and it would be great to have a reasonable conversation about it because the discussion always seems to be sort of mean spirited toward those players. Some of them are just starting out and learning, the learning curve is steep and a new ship for the first time can be really confusing.</p><p>But, we can surely talk about how we can work around players who don't play. Like, Raluca isn't playing she's not using her Physicist skill to work on Pilgred what should we do? I'm starting to realize that her activity level needs to be assessed very quickly if Pilgred is a goal your ship wants to meet. And, we need to realize that it's okay to hang out and keep the ship maintained for as long as possible without ever using PIlgred. It can be just as rewarding to meet other goals like, building a sofa maybe. Seems simple but all of these tasks take team work and when they are completed, it's really rewarding. To me, far more so with a less than ideal and totally active crew. But, if your crew decides to go for Pilgred, you can start early, have someone check on it often and still get it done without an effective Raluca.</p><p>Title holders not doing their jobs (Jin, Janice and Paola) can actually be killed if they are holding up progress - for example, you desperately need O2 but the Commander isn't logging on to move the ship to the planet to get more O2 or loses his title and gains it back repeatedly but never does his job. This is a justified killing. Remember though, no one has Logistics but Paola, no one can give speeches but Jin (I think? ha) and unless you find a Shrink Mage Book, only Janice can comfort, so, these actions need to be weighed carefully.</p><p>The game is still very new and as time goes on, the long term and serious player base will have the skills to carry most ships, but, it will take a bit of time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> This is what happened in the French game, which has been out of beta for a year now.</p>

                <p>Just to add my two cents here (this goes to the general public, not just the OP):</p><p>While suggestions are welcome, when you're trying to push an idea that the admins have already rejected, you're just beating a dead horse. When you make the same arguments over and over again, the admins would simply have heard the same arguments over and over again.</p><p>While it is frustrating to have new people try the game and then no longer play, don't make the situation worse by quitting the game instead of making the best of an suboptimal situation.</p><p>Everyone posting in this forum was at one point a new player. If you would not feel good as a new player playing in a ship where a lot of players expect you to already be a complete expert and be able to do anything requested of you on demand and not one person is willing to offer you a helping hand, how do you expect new players after you to react when you play as though everyone on the ship should either know everything they're supposed to do from Day 1? You may not like how the admins designed how players interact, but if you haven't already, the least you can do is stop complaining, work with what you have, and teach any players willing to learn so that future games will be better.</p><p>To the people who complain inactives are not being punished:<br>Keep in mind that for inactives who give up Mush in general, sanctions will have no effect. Judges and mods look at the evidence presented to them (i.e. logs) and make their best judgment. If there is little evidence to work with, there is always the possibility that someone is inactive for reasons beyond their control. The SDF cannot go around reading minds and presume guilt. However, if there is strong evidence of someone simply giving up a particular game, they are being malicious and consciously breaking the rules and deserved to be sanctioned.</p>

I'm not sure how many inactives we actually had, I believe it was 6, and our mush were both active. Some of our actives were first time players, several of our actives were log in once every 1-2 days kinds of players - one of our mush was highly active, the other was pretty darn active.</p><p>Both mush spored on camera. Both mush ran around, probably having a great time... we could not finish them, between bad luck and massive inactivity.</p><p>Ian was an inactive, went idle in front corridor. There ended up being like 6 people in that front corridor a lot. Chun, Ian, Mush Finola, mush Eleesha, gosh. Others.</p><p>The hunters never came back, as of D4 C4 we haven't seen a hunter since the initial starting game ones were killed, go figure. Good thing that, we couldn't have killed even one, probably.</p><p>We could -not- get those mush killed. We finally slew Finola, but Eleesha was with us until D4. By then the ship had no O2, plants were dead from lack of care I think... no research finished, Roland and Raluca dead to the mush, all kinds of chaos.</p><br><p>But there were some good points. The best of them, one of the newbies, who managed to stay alive until the end, he just died last cycle through suffocation. But one of the things he said to me, finally, in the cycle before he died (we had a private thread going, I invited everyone not mush who could be invited and tried to get people to stay off the main comms so the mush didn't know who was best to kill - the mush were being quite effective and really did have control of that ship from D1 <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":tid_confused:" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>So the newbie, who maybe read my previous messages, even though he never spoke to me or answered in plans, or did much, here he says to me:</p><p><cite>Terrence : Hey is there any way to play with some people that work like in a group? I'd like to play with you and give this game one more chance with you helping me...You'll see my last messages so send me a pm sometime on twinoid or ill be a lonely wolf <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br> </cite></p><p>So I start talking with him, and he's a fine kid. Very much a kid, but a fine one. One that might have walked away from Mush forever, but now he's going to play again I think... though he has much to learn, I wish I had more time with him before the end (that he'd started talking sooner...) as one of his last messages was quite ominous:</p><p><cite>Terrence : Well im sorry we are gonna die and only have met like this in the end <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> but we got twinoid and i'll shoot all the humans if I need to, to get back up in this ghost ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br> </cite></p><p>But yeah. It's the little things. We DID finally kill Eleesha. We did fix a broken O2 tank. We got plasma shield almost to half. We even, with 2 broken O2 tanks, 5 players left, and 3 O2 left, actually got a serious conversation going about what we would have to do to find an oxygen planet and do an expo to get some more air.</p><p>It could have been a horrid hell, but it actually.... had some bright moments. It clearly was a ship going down in flames, but it wasn't a total waste. And I say that as a gold player with 2 days left, having spent the previous 4 days on this Mush-owned ship. There were good moments, there were interesting things, and I did learn more about the game and how it works (and falls apart).</p><p>We can't all slay dragons. Sometimes slaying a mole is the best you can do - so if that's all you can do, by all means play king of the molehill!</p>

Thank you for responding so quickly.</cite><p>They're not exactly intended.

Why can't we discuss this? Maybe the dev team doesn't want to hear it, does that mean we can't talk to one another about it?</cite><p>Talking about it isn't forbidden strictly speaking. The problem, as Psibertus and npfan said, is when people try to push the same ideas over and over again, knowing perfectly that they have already been proposed and refused. Offering solutions has never been forbidden, on the contrary, ideas are welcome, but it's no use demanding the same thing again and again.</p><p>And no, Psibertus, they are not close-minded. In the link I gave you yesterday (the one that worked), there are 10 forum pages of updates, with changes that were mainly based on players' suggestions, remarks, ideas, or bug reports. The last post in that thread dates back to May, but there were other subsequent updates (with some major changes) and there will be many others. And they did say that they were actively looking for <strong>new</strong> solutions against inactivity or griefing. So it would be unfair to say that they don't care about what people think, because it wouldn't be true at all. They do care, and they do listen.</p>

                <p>Frankly, I get annoyed by them too. Not by the threads as such (or not by all of them), because I can understand that people discovering the game and the forum try to offer solutions. What I don't accept is when someone knows a solution has already been refused but keeps pushing it, especially when it degenerates into arguments like "if you don't do it, I'll stop paying", "you don't care what we think, you just want our money" or "you never listen to what we say", which is totally unfair, as I explained. And even if it doesn't degenerate into aggressive comments like that, I don't see the point of keeping those threads open. It is no use insisting on a solution when we know it won't be accepted. You can try to find <em>other</em> solutions, keeping in mind that those solutions may also have been proposed, tried and / or refused already. But harassing the devs with the same ideas won't do any good. Telling them that the players know better than them how the game should work isn't a great idea either.</p><p>What annoys me even more is the negative vision of the game that some of these threads give (and if this threads degenerates into that, we <em>will</em> close it). It does not do any good either to keep saying that all ships are doomed because of inactivity or that it makes the game impossible to play. First of all it is not true, it is an exaggeration. <em>Some</em> ships may be crippled by inactivity, but not all of them, and not even <em>most</em> of them. And even when there is a high number of inactives (or griefers), a ship is very, very rarely doomed. But people giving up can kill a ship.</p><p>That kind of thinking is really harmful for the game. We can't encourage people to expect perfect ships and consider all other ships as doomed, otherwise they will never, ever be satisfied by the game, because perfect ships don't exist, or they are extremely rare. If we encouraged that, the result would be people committing suicide or giving up after the slightest problem (it already happens way too often, actually). It also gives a terrible image of the game, and that's what annoys me most (and Scout too, I guess). It is so unfair for such a great game to have so many messages on the forum saying that all ships are full of inactives and griefers and that it's impossible to have a good ship. If people tried to enjoy the good things instead of focusing on the bad ones, the forum would be much more pleasant to read, and more important, these people would realize that they can have so more fun even if everything isn't perfect.</p>

                <p>Peanutz basically said everything I was going to. Nothing wrong with proposals, just the passive aggressive attitude that comes with them and insisting on things that can't be done.</p><p>All we can do is treat the inactives as a meta challenge to the game. Figure out the best way to get onto a ship with as few inactives as possible. I find that the group jumps do work, and so does getting on a ship during the slower periods. Do check out the Massive Mush Move thread if you're not on a ship now - it does wonders against combating inactives in ships.</p>

I didn't know tut. ships have been tried and failed, for example. So, psibertus, it's not just me being annoyed. I know what the devs want but sometimes I don't know exactly why things are the way they are.</p><p>I don't think some understand how much it bothers me to close a thread or warn someone, I agonize over it, it does nothing for me. I do this job because I love the game and the people who play it, honestly. And, only strive for what Peanutz explains, that there is a positive attitude around the game on the forums. Like Peanutz says, it is totally unfair to the game and the devs to leave and perpetuate a negative attitude. Of course, suggestions are welcome but insulting the devs or fellow players is unacceptable.</p>

                <p>I never said that people should close eyes on the problems or that they should only give praise. There's a middle ground between saying that everything is perfect and saying that "most ships are doomed because most of their crew are inactives". Neither is true, and neither helps to improve the situation.</p><p>I will never say that all ships are perfect, although apart from the very first one, I've only had good, active ships. It may be luck, or it may be that those crews managed not to give up despite the various problems, including inactivity. The last one only had 5 active players for several days, and yet we survived and had fun.</p><p>That's what I was trying to say. Yes, there are problems, and some of them could be solved, even if others are inevitable or solving them would create other kinds of problems. And to solve these problems, as I also said, ideas are welcome on the forum... only not ideas that have been proposed and refused a hundred times. But part of the solution is our own attitude in game. It helps tremendously to have at least one or several crew members who motivate the others, and try to lead, and help people not to give up. I truly believe that it makes a huge difference.</p>

                <p>Perhaps we are simply approaching this in the wrong manner?</p><p>I personally feel that the main issue with inactives is not the people who are active only a little bit, or the people who find the game is not for them after giving it a day or two. I can understand those people quitting/leaving, the pace/social requirement of Mush is certainly not for everyone.</p><p>However, players who fail to complete the tutorial are extremely detrimental to the fun of both sides. I am speaking of the players that one CANNOT speak with at all (because they do not have a walkie-talkie), the ones that starve in day 2 (because they never ate), and the ones that idle endlessly in the front corridor. To the Mush, that is one less potential player who can do anything as an opponent, and to the humans they are a loss of AP and Morale, and often much more if the idler is Chun/Jin Su/Paola/Janice. The point is, the newbies who don't complete the tutorial at all really add nothing to the game.</p><p>Personally, I would like to see tutorial ships. However, to stop players from getting "locked in" to a ship that is full of very new players, I'd like to see something a little different than a full offline tutorial.</p><p>My suggestion</p><p>First, Tutorial ships would be in a different queue than normal ships. Players in a tutorial ship would be able to join a full ship at any time by entering their menu. The option to join a full ship would be directly next to the "Advanced Mode" button, and suggested at the completion of the "first steps" tutorial.</p><p>Second, anyone may join a tutorial ship in addition to a regular ship. Yes, this means you would be able to join two ships at once. This allows experienced players to join Tutorial ships explicitly for the purpose of introducing newbies to the game. Players doing this would know full well that they are getting into a ship predominantly made of newbies/inactives.</p><p>Third, gold/silver status, XP, and progress towards casting tickets do not apply to tutorial ships. Everyone starts and remains in bronze status. Likewise, one may not use Klix. Character level can apply and Cosmetics may be equipped, however.</p><p>Ideally, this would allow newbies to familiarize themselves with the game on a ship that is intended to be used for that. Experienced players can join them and give advice/teach without fear of losing out on cash for gold days/Klix, and as soon as a new player feels comfortable with the interface they can move on to join a full ship armed with the basics. Similarly, full ships would no longer have the routine 1-5 players who join and never once finish the tutorial.</p><p>Win/win for all sides.</p>

Motion Twin games are often structured so that you learn from trial and error.

                <p>What about making some status to account of experienced players (maybe 5-10 games over 5 days). Status 'mentor' which can be choosed by player to indicate he can join tutorial ships and learn newbs. This sort of account could be rewarded with some extra tickets or clicks for every played tut ship. I believe there will be a bunch of players which want to join tutorial ships as mentors for sort of rewards.</p>

                <p>Kloonej, tutorial ships have been suggested and tried in the French game and were scrapped. They are not coming back. I know Motion Twin would like us to mentor new players on the ships we have now and there's no reason we can't do that. I also can't see Motion Twin separating us into different player groups or statuses. I'm pretty sure this goes against their vision for the game, one which puts us together in a random way.</p><p>And, we're right back to this being some problem that needs fixing. These challenges are very rewarding when real solutions are found to work around them. No less as challenging or rewarding as avoiding 40 hunters or something because that's mostly luck. Working with the human challenges can take some real skill.</p>

So, all the explanations as to WHY idlers are detrimental to humans and Mush in this game, I am totally aware. What I'm saying is that your definition of detrimental isn't universal.

                <p>To technically "win" a game, you need serum, and you need research, and you need someone moving the ship. All other roles can be easily covered by different crew, but these 3 things are absolutely required. Therefore I would define them as more important. Also, by definition Jin and Chun are the most important crew members.

                <p>Well, I'm not arguing that you cant play the game, I'm saying it severely reduces how enjoyable the game is for those actually playing it. To decide these specific three characters not be playable for -first time- players, is a very specific choice, and not arbitrary. Many new characters are not presented these options anyways due to luck of the draw. If a ship had only these three slots to fill, they would simply be sent to the next open ship. If you can present a real downside to this I'd love to hear it.</p><p>(also just a note: I'm continuing posting just for the sake of arguement.

Any character that's lost hurts potential gameplay in some way. To say somehow losing specific three characters hurts the game far more than losing any three characters is very short-sighted. This is a multidimensional game where many aspects are taken into account. Your claim that somehow restricting certain characters will dramatically improve future ships is unsubstantiated. It's obvious you value certain things more than others, and you have every right to feel that way, but nonetheless highly subjective. If you're going to advocate certain characters be restricted, I can argue why every character should be restricted, and thus choosing certain characters to be restricted is arbitrary.</p>

The game does a pretty good job of having workarounds for most characters being missing, and if I were going to argue about certain characters being irreplaceable, I'd honestly choose totally different ones than you did.</p><p>For instance - a brand new player picking Gioele deprives a ship of something that can't be replaced, that extra coffee AP. On a ship where PILGRED gets fixed, that's up to 16 AP a day that ship doesn't get. And Janice, well if a new player picks her and goes inactive, you just have to hope it was in a dorm. But your ship is seriously hurt on morale in a way that there isn't a good replacement for. A brand new player picks Roland, you're down one of the two most common pilots, and that is gonna cost.</p><p>Not that I think character choice should be restricted, or am unwelcoming of newbies on my ship, quite the opposite! Just illustrating the subjectivity of it a bit. I bet someone else could come up with 3 totally different characters based on who/what they see as the most important. You're going to be missing something on any given ship. But really, that's part of the fun of the game - figuring out what you have to work with and trying to make it work. So very satisfying when you succeed. ^^</p>

                <p>I will admit I do have a rather competitive nature, I enjoy "winning" games if the experience is fun and challenging. Of course I also enjoy losing games in many cases, especially if I can take something from the experience and learn from it -and perhaps do better next time. (I much enjoy dwarf fortress for instance, despite never once winning <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> )</p><p>We may have to agree to disagree on certain points. I am unconvinced that the captain (person who made it all come together) and Chun (the only known human resistant to mush) and not inherently more important, especially if you just look at it from a lore perspective. I would also argue due to game mechanics and lore, Reluca also deserves this title (but that is of course only my opinion).</p><p>As for proof, I am not a dev and I cannot test this idea. It is a hypothesis and as they say the proof is in the pudding. But I see no downside to trying, Can you name one?</p>

                <p>You're right, it is a half measure (if even that). Unfortunately the real (and tested, by many many other games) solutions have been shot down by the Devs.</p><p>Which brings me to another thought. Has any reason ever been given -why- the tutorial ship failed in beta? I mean how do you fuck that up? Sorry for letting my bitter show, but I'm on a new ship with well over half inactive crew again, and this is only my second ship. I can only imagine how frustrating it would be to have a succession of empty ships.</p><p>To tell us the game is designed with a high level of inactive players being a -feature-, is frankly insulting to our intelligence. This is directed at the developers, not admins here- who I think have been doing a pretty great job considering what they have to work with.</p>

                <p>I really appreciate this opportunity to transparent discussion since it seems like a lot of threads get closed simply because everyone isn't towing the party line. These are genuine issues that continue to plague the game in the eyes of the players, whether the developers want to call them "intended features" or not. Player time is wasted and money is also wasted for those who choose to actually pay for the game. These don't entitle people to be aggressive or sarcastic I agree, but it doesn't it mean they should have a voice in expressing how they feel about the situation and offer up solutions?</p><p>What I dislike seeing is people shooting down every suggestion universally with the simple explanation "the developers won't do that" and "the developers already tried that" without any proof or links to these supposed discussions. Why shoot down every offer of solution? Can we not test some things or bring something to the developers attention? There have been a lot of newer solutions in this thread even that were shot down as "half measures" or simply lumped once again into "the developers probably already tried that or wouldn't try that, I have no proof but they just wouldn't like that sorry" without even being allowed to be considered. This makes me frustrated and I think I am not alone. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I actually agree with JD_Ender. Is there not a probability mechanic already in place by the developers to limit new players from becoming MUSH? And if so how is that any different than what he is suggesting? Furthermore, it flies in the face of your (npfan) argument about "restricting possibilities" which JD already explained wasn't really accurate as it many players on their second ship (still very new) would be able to select those roles.</p>

It's a probability mechanic, not a strict restriction. There is still a possibility a new player can be Mush. Also, no one but the developers know just how much chance is decreased, so we don't even know how significant this is.<br>2. Limiting who becomes mush is different because mush selection is independent of what character is selected (for the most part). On the other hand, choosing which characters to restrict has so far been based on one person's preference. Why is Ender's choice of characters any better to restrict than another set of characters? Also, how does this actually solve the inactive problem? You say it's makes gameplay better, but my argument is that it only changes gameplay biased towards making certain aspects of the game more secure but makes the other aspects less secure.</p>

                <p>I agree it would be complex to code, but what about a system that considers what roles other newbies already have? If a newbie has taken, say, Hua on a certain ship, the code could be made to ensure that at least one or two other pilot characters are saved (or verify were already were given) for experienced characters. If that makes a ship take longer than a reasonable time to fill, then open these characters again to everyone because after a certain point the wait to fill becomes worse than the problems faced by high numbers of inexperienced players on a single ship.</p><p>Since there's characters that support each other with duplicate skill sets, to some extent, a check and balance system between experience and inexperience could be useful in that case.</p>

Of course I also enjoy losing games in many cases, especially if I can take something from the experience and learn from it -and perhaps do better next time. (I much enjoy dwarf fortress for instance, despite never once winning <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> )</cite><p>Then apply your Dwarf Fortress attitude here as well. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Mush is not a mainstream game, it requires a certain type of patience.</p><br><br><p>The French game had people complaining about idlers and clarified during their beta years ago that this is the game they want us to play. There are changes coming, they tweak it all the time but sanctioning or restricting players because we don't like their activity levels doesn't seem to be a change that's going to happen.</p><p>Vector, you don't like "people shooting down every suggestion universally with the simple explanation "the developers won't do that" and "the developers already tried that" without any proof or links to these supposed discussions." There is proof, Peanutz has linked things from the French forums for us, she's explained in detail in this very thread. Not only that, I also know Motion Twin quite well, I know what they are going for here, they don't want a game we can control 100%, it's random in many way for a reason. It just makes sense to me.</p><p>I do understand the frustration and have had to learn patience and adopt this mindset myself, it doesn't come naturally. It honestly helps me be a more patient person and I love how die2nite and Mush have done this for me. :o</p><p>Most everyone has been very respectful but there has been so much effort put into long explanations as to why we mods are wrong headed or purposefully dismissive in our answers and we're really not and it's not fair to us. We're working with what we've been given.</p><p>edit: okay so many replies since I started typing heh. Also, was going to say we should maybe use the suggestion thread for this but I talked it out with Peanutz and we'll leave it open. It's respectful and it is a good discussion. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"> Thanks everyone for keeping it this way!</p>

Who are we to demand that answer anyway? Peanutz did what she could to get us information from ages ago in French Mush. IIRC, she stated that she couldn't find the reason, but that she remembered MT trying it and declaring it a failure. It's *their* game. It's up to *them* to decide what works and what doesn't, or how to proceed with, well, anything really.</p><p>What do we get to do? We get to choose whether to a) play the game or not, b) pay money for it or not. Beyond that, no one's forcing you to do anything.</p><p>If you thought that one of the test chambers in Portal had a flaw and posted repeatedly in the steam forums demanding that Valve fix their game or explain why they designed it that way, do you really think you'd get anything other than laughed out of the forum?</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_7742346 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7742346">lordwok</span></span><cite>suggesting everybody who feels this is a problem is holding their breathe in a juvenile tantrum is a bit shortsighted in my opinon. this is a problem for people who dont jump in a coordinated fashion guys seriously thats why there is so many posts about it.</cite><p>No, I'm not suggesting that people that think this way are petulant children. I <strong>am</strong> suggesting that people that demand things that have been specifically shot down by the developers as something that will. not. happen. are petulant children.</p><p>There comes a time in our lives where we have to recognize we don't always get our way and no amount of yelling, screaming, demanding, breath-holding, tantrum-throwing or anything else is going to change something. In fact, there comes a time shortly after that where we realize that that's the best way to get the exact opposite of what you're looking for.</p><p>Try going into the grocery store and looking at the cashier and demanding in a haughty tone that you're in a hurry and they need to ring up your purchase FAST. Then see just how slow they can possibly go without getting in trouble.</p><p>I *know* it's an issue. Hell, I wish there was something that could be done about it too. I've had ideas on how to improve the tutorial. And I've been playing MT games for a long long time now and I know how likely anything is to change if they haven't already thought of it first. (honestly, it's not going to. It's just not. It's a fact you will eventually come to live with or you'll leave the MT games out of sheer frustration. I've seen people go both ways.)</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_7742346 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7742346">lordwok</span></span><cite>its nowhere near as bad now as it was in the couple of months before xmas but you can still see people are getting ships where 6 people are playing. thats why they are posting about it even when it is obvious that you dont want them to anymore.</cite><p>And it will keep getting better. For better or worse the game is still new. Word is still just getting out there and there are new people hitting the site in droves (ok, not as large as immediately after release). What there's NOT a lot of is upfront information. People really don't know what they're getting into or the mechanics of the game and they may decide they just don't like the game and they leave. It happens. There <strong>will</strong> eventually be a point where it balances out. There will always be inactives, but the numbers will dwindle.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_7742346 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7742346">lordwok</span></span><cite><p>i agree you arnt supposed to have a full compliment of 16 but when your getting ships where both mush dont even play or you have newplayer inactives AND regular inactives and your playing the game with a handful of people it becomes frustrating.</p><p>i agree with the offical stance about regular folks just going inactive you cant really sanction or control this and people shouldnt be punished because life happens but it would be remarkably simple to give people their first look at mush someplace other then a live ship so if they dont like it and just close the browser tab this doesnt screw over a ship of people who are going to play on that ship for 2+weeks.</p></cite><p>The first look at an offline ship has been shot down by the developers. Really, that's the end of that story. So what do you suggest from here? Instead of refusing to breathe, you have two options. You can accept things as they are and have fun despite the annoyances, or you can put some thought into <strong>new</strong> suggestions and propose those. I believe it was stated earlier in the thread that MT said they would entertain well thought out suggestions that haven't already been tried and discarded (though for me personally, that falls into "I'll believe it when I see it" ).</p><p>Suggestions aren't off the table. THAT suggestion is off the table. There's a difference.</p>

Customers pay money for goods or services.</p><p>Would MT stand to make more money if they caved to our demands? Abso-fuckin-lutely. Do they have to do it? No. If they've decided they're making plenty of money as is or if they're just plain done or whatever the hell they want to decide for whatever reasons they want to decide it, that's their right. Just like it's our right to take our money and go to a different site.</p><p>But they owe us nothing and people really need to remember that. It's not like we even paid money just to get access to the game THEN found out we didn't like it. Those of us that have paid money for any of their games have paid it knowing full well what the game was (or at least knowing that we didn't really know) and that there were limited promises made to us.</p><p>In the case of mush, I paid for:<br>- an iTrackie <br>- double XP gained<br>- more skill slots<br>- 2 extra health<br>- 2 extra morale<br>- extra casting tickets as promised on the payment page for certain subscription lengths</p><p>Nowhere in that list is a realistic expectation that I should have all voyages go exactly as I want them to. Nor is there a mention that ships will have fewer (or no) inactive players. It doesn't say anything about more responsive staff that listens to me or what I want. It's a very limited list of things that I get, and that's all I can reasonably expect for my money.</p>

Your average ship lasts about twice what my average ship does. I'd trade you crews in a freakin' heartbeat. (Editing again to point out that the Eden return was a cross-beta/live ship. Everything after that has been in "The Dawn" and non-beta. Don't bother pointing to the Eden return or anything prior to that)</p>

                <p>There is really no need to be aggressive about it guys. Live and let live I say. There is reasonable discourse to be had in letting people vent a bit without going for their throat and making yourself seem like an apologist, spacekadt. Apologies if that offends but that is how you are coming off a bit here.</p><p>I really think both sides have a legitimate stance and source of frustration. Really neither of you are right or wrong more than the other. So there is no need for the "us" vs "them" mentality here. We are all players, some of us a frustrated by what many would consider poor development practices in place, some are frustrated because these other people are frustrated and they don't think their frustration is justified. That seems a bit silly doesn't it?</p><p>Now for the people frustrated with the inactive issues in the game and tutorial things and ideas getting shot down, you also have a lot of cleaning up to do. Many are too aggressive, dismissive and just generally negative in tone, which leads to your posts getting ignored or attacked by people who love the game. Let's be honest with ourselves, we all care about the game or we wouldn't be posting here.</p><p>Finally, I have to say I do not honestly believe anything said here will influence the development style or implementation of Motion-Twin for MUSH or any other game. That might seem a bit negative but really I think it's true, this is simply a forum for us to talk about the game that they have provided so players can have a community around it. That's it.</p><p><strong>All feedback we have gotten so far points to one thing and one thing only: they just aren't going to change their stance on inactives, tutorial ships</strong> or just about anything else in the game outside minor bug fixes and translation issues (which we are still waiting on). They are a small, inventive but in my honest opinion very sloppy developer. And that's okay. They make fun games.</p><p>TL;DR:</p><p>Mush is fun just the way it is. It very likely will not change at all. The sooner everyone realizes that, the sooner they can leave or just move on.</p>

                <p>Argh to much snark! Bit of an overdramatization, but you are right about the issue dissuading the choice to pay for the game.<br>Me personally I don't see myself spending much money so long as things don't change, but then I am enjoying it adequatly enough without spending to much money so I'm not complaining. Kind of a shame, but que sera sera.</p><p>Fraudulent is definatly far off however. A little misleading, of course if you let yourself be misled. But fraudulent? Come on.</p>

Or barring that, that there are no sufficient workarounds to improve the social aspect of this game (having more active crew). It's still a new game (for us anyways) though, there is time, and we can hope.</p>

                <p>It is <strong>not </strong>acceptable to mention fraud in this context. Hyperbole will not help this discussion, it only serves to provoke and confuse. You personally not knowing that this is a multiplayer game isn't a wide spread problem. Most of us knew exactly the type of game we were signing up for. And, if not, it's hardly worth shouting "fraud" over.</p><p>Maybe the tutorial didn't "fail" maybe they realized it didn't fit in with their vision of random cooperative play. Like others have said, it doesn't really matter, it was discarded a long time ago and has never resurfaced.</p>

                <p>Too late to edit. Inactives also decrease the probability of an active player being injured by a steel plate or having a panick attack. It is less useful than for oxygen, because you can have oxygen problems early in the game, whereas steel plates and panick attacks become more frequent in late game, when most inactives are dead. But even in the first days, if you avoid a steel plate thanks to an inactive, it's not that bad.</p>

                <p>I'm a newbie, my first game ever is still ongoing. Since newbies who go braindead are made out to be the main problem here, maybe I can contribute by giving my perspective.</p><p>I was apparently very lucky with my ship. We have a lot of active players, and we are at day 7 and still going strong. At the beginning, one other newbie who completed the tutorial and I were invited to private chat by an experienced player, which was extremely helpful. Unfortunately, their schedule and mine are completely opposite. No one else ever approached me directly to tell me what I should do, even though at least a couple are very experienced players, too, and everyone has more experience than I do.</p><p>I'm a proactive kind of person, so I had already said in general chat that I'm a newbie and that they needed to tell me what to do. I posted what I was planning to do and asked what I should be doing. But often, unless I directly asked another character, I wouldn't get any response. There's one player on my ship who rarely coordinates with other players. But if someone does anything they don't agree with, they berate that player.</p><p>Now imagine being a newbie on a ship without that one really helpful player, and with a couple of persons like the last one. You're intimidated by the chat, maybe English is your second language. Nobody tells you what to do, but if you do anything wrong, you're being shouted at. Would you continue playing? Why would anyone come back for that?</p><p>I have obviously no idea how it is on other ships. My ship, despite what I said about not getting responses, is actually a ship full of generally nice and helpful people. And what I've talked about mainly happened during the first couple of days, we have all become more chatty since then and learned to work as a team. Maybe it really is extraordinary to get a ship like that, but for me, a couple of key player made it a success.</p><p>I'd guess that for every one or two newbies who don't bother to even continue the tutorial there's one who genuinely wants to play and be helpful to the team. As experienced players, if you want to have a good ship, approach new players. If they post in chat, reply. If they do something wrong, explain why that wasn't a good idea without being abrasive. They are most likely not stupid, they are inexperienced, which is not the same. In a lot of cases, *you* are the one who should've known better and should've told the newbies beforehand what they should and shouldn't be doing.</p><p>This won't prevent ships with a lot of inactive players, but having 1 or 2 active players more will make it definitely better. As extra bonus, newbies that had some help on their first ship will be better players on their second ship already. A newbie that is left alone will still be a newbie on his next ship.</p>

                <p>All good points. There are <strong>a ton</strong> of mistakes just waiting for new players to make them in this game. I try to go over the most damaging ones before they're made at the beginning of a ship, either in gen chat or PM if they're character specific, but there are always ones you're not going to think to mention. And sometimes you just don't have time. Mistakes will happen, even among crews with no first time players. The tone you take and whether or not you offer full explanation as to why 'that thing you just did' shouldn't be done is definitely important.

All they get is silence, and not realizing the nature of Chat (that it is just forum threads basically) they leave or proceed to waste AP, and then leave.. It doesn't help the tutorial video makes this game look like a real time game with chat bubbles and unrelated shit (when have I ever got 100 points for fixing a door <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>On the positive side, I think that could all be fixed with (much, much, much) better tooltips, and a real-time'ish chat (which seems to be the direction things are going).</p>

All they get is silence, and not realizing the nature of Chat (that it is just forum threads basically) they leave or proceed to waste AP, and then leave.. It doesn't help the tutorial video makes this game look like a real time game with chat bubbles and unrelated shit (when have I ever got 100 points for fixing a door <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">).<br><br>On the positive side, I think that could all be fixed with (much, much, much) better tooltips, and a real-time'ish chat (which seems to be the direction things are going).</cite><br>Agreed.</p>

                <p>Necroing with new idea:</p><p>It thought about this last time and get new observations:</p><p><em>Why newcomers leaving game in first cycles/days? </em></p><p>Because they expect something else while seeing main page with one directed video and nothing else. truth is most of new players just click PLAY to take some experience instead google for <em>let`s play</em> or something like that.</p><p>So what they expect from this first view on index? They can see isometric action game where You wandering around ship (no cost), talking to others in popups over characters head. Making some 300 APMs -after that they hit the start.</p><p>Now comes reality, moving costs MP, actions are scarce during day cycle. None talk much and if they do, it`s meta gibber.</p><p>I remember that My expectations Was same by seeing mush front page, but I just hit the Tube and watch sort of <em>let`s play</em> videos. Not that it change something, the way mush is played fits even more than some ARPG. But this is Me, I`m not typical player, I`m below and over the standards.</p><p>Forums doesn`t resolve the problem, because they don`t get here before start game. After that it changes probably nothing.</p><p>I think this is main cause of leaving game by newbs. Start page should have more accurate presentation of game, that new players would know what they deal with, if they knew from beginning this is more like board game that starcraft 2 they could be prepared or at least don`t get involved.</p>
