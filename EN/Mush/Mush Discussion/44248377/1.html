                <p>So how can we detect the Mush? One of simply ways is counting AP. Pilot who can't shoot hunter because got exhausted if hasn't shot any of them before? Or someone else who doesn't relay projects or research? No comms, no gardening, no scanning... And they have been in the room that the shower is located. Yeah, it looks suspicious... There's just one person, who usually doesn't relay anything, and usually the most suspicion person amongst crew: <strong>Eleesha</strong>.</p><p>So why Eleesha? When she doesn't relay anything and doesn't do anything that crew could check, she takes the Scooter and moves around the ship finding the Mush. And then crew is afraid because they're limited to a few rooms they visit on the way to their work, when Eleesha could have visited all the rooms around the Daedalus. And items spread in Daedalus, which are hidden somewhere and whose location know just two women: Chun and... Eleesha. <em>If Eleesha is Mush, our ship is screwed, she'll throw 2 grenades, use knife and take armor, maybe leave us on planet while she uses Hacker Kit, and she has the Mage Book...</em> Eleesha takes care of crew, but who takes care of Eleesha? And when there's no Mush alive in comrade bar, can we believe Eleesha who claims we're Mush free?</p><p>Although it's chance 2/15 that Eleesha can become a Mush, I see on 13/15 ships where Eleesha acts suspicious. Eleesha takes the Scooter and check all rooms and informs Chun everything. She doesn't share his reports anybody else, who could be possibly Mush. Even if she narrows down the list of possibly Mush checking who starves, gets ill, eats twice, gets "Negative" status on Xyloph list, crew still suspects Eleesha because as she narrows down the possibly Mush, she's still on their list and she increases herself the chance of being Mush.</p><p>I played once as Eleesha, human of course. How did I play Eleesha as human? First days - I noticed Derek dirty in the Bravo Dorm. He made a PM with me and alarmed that he'd been Janice but he got a victim of transfer. I worked out that Derek infected Janice directly under camera and he lied about transfer, and I stabbed him showing crew that we're one Mush less. And then I felt relieved that I gained trust. As there was no technician, both showers were available, however I was roaming between rooms, visiting dorm quite often. I used all my AP into moving, moving and moving, and nothing else. I was watching logs and tried to remember the ones in two places: Refectory and Laboratory. I was wasting my AP because it was happening that I forgot some logs and I wanted to look at them again. Once I trusted Janice as the Mush couldn't be a victim of getting spiked, I got Panic Attack at first days and wanted Janice to comfort me. In the end she invited me into the channel where she told somebody that she had suspected me since the Panic Attack. She claimed that I got Panic Attack so early and she was afraid of me that I was wandering around the ship and hiding some important inventory and nobody knew their location. As she trusted the same person I trusted, as I was reporting him everything, he shared my suspects and reports with Janice. Although I killed the Mush, but I could pretend to believe Derek and kill Janice first, or do nothing and watch how accidents happen, I was still suspicious of being sneaky Mush who could control the ship and fool the humanity.</p><p>I'd had another ship before, where Eleesha wasn't suspicious. She had two skills: Tracker and IT Expert. How did it happen? She nicely relayed research and projects, never reported dirtyness and shared her reports if crew - if crew wanted some logs, she copied and pasted in PM. Moreover, she was a Mush. In this ship there was Stephen who relayed research many times, but stayed in unsecured Lab. Once they made got MycoAlarms (mainly thanks to Stephen) Hua accidently made it ring. There were two people in the Lab right then: inactive Kuan Ti and Stephen. Stephen killed Hua - one Mush less. A day later, crew notice that logs in Alpha Dorm had been defaced. There were me, Stephen, Eleesha, and a few other people, also a few people wandering in Rear Corridor and Alpha Bay in the cycle deface happened. I suspected that Stephen was Beta Mush. I invited a few people who looked for me as human. They highly suspected me because I was annoying. I informed them my suspects, that Stephen was Mush then and Alpha Mush is still unknown. I suspected Eleesha a bit because she relayed research - right, but in unsecured Lab, when she had possibility to convert people. When I told the the list of possibly Alpha Mush, they didn't think any of them would be Mush and throw all suspicion at me. For them I was possible in 99% as Mush, but Eleesha - 1%. Once Stephen logged on after deface, he made a rampage. As he was Shrink (Apprenticeship), he transferred into Janice and mutated. They killed Janice quickly. Now we had no Mush alive in comrade bar, but I didn't believe there was no Mush. I still threw suspicions, and they still suspected me. I just waited for Eleesha report. If she claimed no Mush, I'd get sure that she was the Mush. And she claimed. I told human team that we had to kill Eleesha, but they believed her, as Stephen was the Alpha Mush. But they were yelling, and threatened that they'd kill me if I tried to kill Eleesha. <em>No more killings!</em> I could just order Raluca to stop the PILGRED and wait for RFS. And once we got planet, Eleesha took Hacker Kit and got rid of us.</p><p>So human Eleesha consumes all AP to move and make sure the Mush won't make spores, being afraid of them, while Mush Eleesha doesn't need to move around the ship if she knows who the Mush is. She just takes a simply way to help crew in doing tasks and the AP which human Eleesha would use to move to make sure if Mush could do something in any corner of this ship, Mush Eleesha uses to relay and she still have some AP to make spores, the AP supposed to be used for investigation.</p>

You're expected to hunt mush, but she can also be the coms officer, main tech and main researcher (with IT expert) - all while trying to get the crew to not kill her. I normally try to eat a lot but some crews will still murder you for getting bravo dorm logs. You can kinda counter act it by only getting the rear corridor &amp; bravo bay logs but it does make the mush hunt harder so I don't do it as often as I really should.</p>

                <p>I actually find this very fun since it adds to the game. I've seen a lot of games on the french server where Stephen is very often mush and he would be killed off just to be sure. Now that I started the English server it seems Eleesha (while she was always a little more suspicious then many) is the one to be killed first. I've never played Eleesha yet so I cannot really say anything about her except what I have read from the tutorials, but she seems to be a very complex character to play if you want to be taken human, be you already human or mush. Except if she gets an illness (or accepts to double feed, which I think should not exist) she will never be 100% confirmed human. And even then, you can always become a Beta mush. If it was possible to do, being Alpha I would infect her 2 (or 3) times and wait for her to get sick before getting the 3rd (or 4th) one. 100% confirmed, yet mush.</p>

You're expected to hunt mush, but she can also be the coms officer, main tech and main researcher (with IT expert) - all while trying to get the crew to not kill her. I normally try to eat a lot but some crews will still murder you for getting bravo dorm logs. You can kinda counter act it by only getting the rear corridor &amp; bravo bay logs but it does make the mush hunt harder so I don't do it as often as I really should.</p></cite><p>Yea after posting i found it .........Atfirst i thought he was Eleesha so i just asked <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>But i can say Andie is best so far <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>But on a random ship metagaming might not always be the best way. A metagamer could accidentally kill the wrong person who was moving despite the character is not "supposed to move that much". Therefore it is always better to watch for multiple evidences before killing someone. It also decreases your chances to get sanctioned at one point.</p>
