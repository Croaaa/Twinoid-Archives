This means that cycles would have to be dramatically shortened, AP/MP gauges and costs changed, and various skills and balance aspects which depend on idleness (such as Lethargic) to be re-worked.</p><p>My questions to you are:</p><p>1) Would you still enjoy Mush if it required real-time attention to finish a match?<br>2) What kind of timing and match durations could you see work? (Asking players to participate for 3 hours is a bit much...)<br>3) What do you think would have to considerably changed from the current formula?<br>4) If you dislike the idea of Mush being real-time, do you have ideas on how to minimize idleness and other downsides of Mush's current timing?</p><p>Let me know your thoughts!

What you are proposing is to shorten the length of those ticks dramatically to accommodate a game that can be played to completion by 16 players in one session. So far, I'm just nitpicking the terminology.</p><p><cite>My questions to you are:<br><br>1) Would you still enjoy Mush if it required real-time attention to finish a match?</cite><br>Possibly. I tend to be very active and available on the ships I participate in. If other players were guaranteed to be active and available, it would reduce the time necessary to facilitate cooperation towards efficiency on a per cycle basis. However, I am unsure the balancing necessary in game mechanics as well as the social puzzle would lead to a game identifiable as the same game, aside from branding and characters.</p><p><cite>2) What kind of timing and match durations could you see work? (Asking players to participate for 3 hours is a bit much...)</cite><br>If 3 hours is too much, I don't see it working at all, and would probably play something like Space Station 13 instead.<br><cite>3) What do you think would have to considerably changed from the current formula?</cite><br>I think you'd have to create a new game from scratch. The interface, graphics, cycle-based events, combat mechanics, astronavigation, NERON Projects... The list goes on and on. Everything needs to get tossed out and redone because everything in the game is based on taking the time time and efficiency required with cycles extending the game over a period of days. Perhaps all such mechanics would be, instead of spending accumulated AP representing time and efficiency, replaced with various puzzles and minigames in the vein of "Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates," then maybe it could work, but this is a drastically different game.<br><cite>4) If you dislike the idea of Mush being real-time, do you have ideas on how to minimize idleness and other downsides of Mush's current timing?</cite><br>To minimize idleness, you simply need active, committed players. Castings provide a simple way to achieve this. If you consider 3 hour cycles to be a "downside" to Mush's current timing, castings also allow an option for 2 or 1 hour cycles. I'm curious what you think the downsides to Mush's current timing are. The game is not designed to be played with all players active at all times (or even awake), and is in fact intended to be balanced around the likelihood that not all 16 players will show any activity at all.</p><p>Let me know your thoughts!

                <p>As Cross already pointed out it is a real-time game already. I actually wouldn't have that much problems to play a 2-3 hour match if I have the evening free - but when would that match be over? Dead mush? Sol return? Eden?

I'm curious what you think the downsides to Mush's current timing are. The game is not designed to be played with all players active at all times (or even awake), and is in fact intended to be balanced around the likelihood that not all 16 players will show any activity at all.</cite><br>I don't think Castings are a proper solution, the random character assignment doesn't work for me and the 2h cycles only ruin the regularity of the game. It's easy to fit playing mush in a normal day routine because you know x o'clock means it's currently cycle 5 or whatever, 2h cycles make it harder to figure out when your crewmates will be back cause it's not always the same cycles and the time you need to check the plants or decode a rebelbase changes aswell.</p><p>My last ship was cut short by a mush rampage, that annoyed me cause it was a promising ship even though it was far from ideal. I was annoyed, maybe sad - but what pissed me of and always makes me mad every time I have to read that sort of crap are last words of a fellow human in the GC. Classic combination of 'please kill me blabla gold days', 'ship was over from the start/ a waste to being with','to many inactives' and ' blabla inactivity but active mush'.</p><p>So yes, things would already work a lot better with "<strong>active, committed players</strong>" that realize that the game "<strong>is in fact intended to be balanced around the likelihood that not all 16 players will show any activity at all</strong>". I remember reading about someone stuck on a ship with 15 idlers a while back but in most cases all those 'inactivity ruined the ship' claims just serve as excuses why the active players failed or <em>and that's so much worse than the initial active players</em> why they didn't even try.</p><p>Nnnn I think I went off-topic there. @ Topic:<br><strong>3) What do you think would have to considerably changed from the current formula?</strong><br>If I understood you right, you're aiming for a xy minutes/hours long version with all or most of the players online at the same time. Then I think it'd be crucial for a 'casual match' without week long negotiations before the start to have less characters.</p>

You can certainly design a game that intends to have 16 players play from start to finish. Or you can design it so people can freely drop in and out, or that the full cast is not necessary to complete the game if people disappear. There are pros and cons to each method. To commit 16 players from start to finish, you're going to have long waits until a game starts and infrequent ships launching. It's not just a matter of getting people ready, but people knowing they need to commit their attention and focus reduces the player pool at any given moment.</p><p>To make what might be an unfair comparison, I've always wanted to play Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator, but I don't have the people to play it with, so that game has been inaccessible to me. Granted, that game is designed to be played locally with friends you can see with your own two eyes, but Mush doesn't exactly have hundreds of people joining ships in a day.</p><p>I'm not really making strong arguments on this point, but ultimately, it can go either way, there's no wrong answer, it depends on what the goal is for the game. I'm not sure how much I like the idea of say, Raluca playing for 33% of the game, quitting, and having someone take over Raluca. I feel like that destroys the social element of the game and the infused identity of the players into the characters, and switches the focus to a much heavier emphasis on roles and mechanics. But hey, at the same time, if it's done right, it could work.</p><p><cite>As for AP, my idea was simply that gauges are much more limited, however refill fully upon every cycle end, instead of regenerating over time.</cite></p><p>I think I see what you're getting at. My problem with this is that I believe that AP is valuable in Mush <strong>because of the time</strong> it takes to generate, which leads to a strong desire to be efficient with it. If someone is getting 2, 4, or 6 AP every 2, 5, or 10 minutes or whatever scale might be proposed, it becomes less valuable of a resource, and it makes accomplishing objectives seem trivial. Just wait a few minutes and relay back and forth with me and Plasma Shield will be complete detracts from the relatively grandiose sense of accomplishment we have currently.</p><p>I've always had a personal distaste for many RTS games which lack a certain amount of depth, because the winner essentially boils down to who can click the fastest. Harvest resources -&gt; Build bases -&gt; Build units -&gt; Assault. The only thing that bottlenecks the process is how efficient you can be with what you're clicking, where you're clicking, and how fast you're clicking.</p><p>This is why I suggested you could go the way of Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates. If you've never played it, a group of players gather on a pirate ship. There are different sized ships with a different capacity for players, ranging from something like 6 players to 64 players (it's been a while since I played). There would be different stations scattered across the ship: Bilge, Carpentry, Sails, Navigation, Guns. Everybody mans a station. The Bilger plays a Match 3 type game to pump out water that the ship is taking on. If he performs well, more water is removed and the ship is not as affected by the bilge water, which slows down the ship. The Carpenter plays a tangrams type puzzle to repair the hull. The Sailor plays a Dr. Mario type game to generate sail tokens for the Navigator to use. The gunner plays a puzzle which is similar to some game I've never played but I think was popular in Japan, essentially loading the cannons so they can be refired. The sole Navigator plays on a turnbased chessboard against another ship using sail tokens and cannons to plot out moves and overtake the other ship. Then it leads to a boarding process and all players participate in a group swordfight, playing a game like Super Puzzle Fighter Turbo to ultimately win the battle, and whichever ship performed better in Battle Navigation has an advantage in the Swordfight phase.</p><p>Sorry for the longwinded explanation, but my point is, when reducing the time scale of a game like Mush from weeks to a couple hours, I think it might be important to switch the focus entirely from a game of spending accumulated energy to accomplish things, to something more entirely skill-based in an effort to retain meaningful gameplay and accomplishment. Do you want to spend a couple hours performing relays and seeing what random stuff pops up in Astronav so you can explore a planet with random outcomes and be done with the whole thing (I'm not even thinking about how the Mush work in the whole thing right now). I think that only really works as successful gameplay in the grand scale we currently have. Wouldn't you rather play a research minigame with a relayer for a while, and the better you perform, the more research gets done? Same for NERON projects, astronavigation, planet exploration, so on and so forth.</p><p>Just my rambling thoughts.</p>

                <p>I'm intrigued by the fact that people seem willing to invest ~3 hours a pop to resolve a game session. I also understand that the time frame of 2.5-3 hours would also be the most merciful for RP opportunities, as you can't really RP much when you're busy rushing your actions in 2-3 minute cycles.</p><p>The background for this thread is that I've been working on bringing my dreams of a Mush-like game to completion over the past few weeks. My new job as web developer turned it from a distant fantasy to something very realizable. It is not *Mush* per ce, sporting an entirely different settings, different roles, people etc., but gameplay-wise I expect to draw a lot from it.</p><p>Hence my questions here; the wonderful (active) player base is one of Mush's biggest advantages, and I was hoping to appeal to the very same people when my work picks up pace. That's why I'm wondering about your likes and dislikes, whether or not you think shorter game times (and guaranteed player presence) are a good idea, or you would like to keep things on a long-time scale. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>There's ways to make long-time games work, too, of course; simply better documentation (big warning texts telling you that you're committing to the match over several days), e-mail/SMS notifications for cycle changes, etc. But, at the beginning, shortening the cycles and gameplay was my first idea on preventing idling, and ensuring full participation.</p><p>Hmm.</p>

                <p>EpicMafia and Mush are the only browser games of the genre that I can draw comparisons from. Besides that, I've also played Space Station 13 and WarCraft 3 custom maps such as Vampirism, Trolls vs Elves and Dark Deeds which have somewhat similar premises (secret villain, social tension).</p><p>If you have any concise examples of similar games done right, I'd love to hear about them.</p><p>One of my main concerns is striking the balance between attractive session lengths AND being able to RP nicely.</p>

                <p>The main draw in Mush for me is RP, which actually benefits nicely from the long format it currently has. I am a busy person and have other things I have to do, but I can drop in whenever I want and respond to things as they appear. The detective/traitor gameplay also benefits from things unfolding slowly over real time. You gather evidence about other people and their actions, and have time to ponder that evidence until you feel like you can arrive at a verdict. Inactives are always a problem (and will definitely remain so because the tutorial could not be uncoupled from live ships), but they are not insurmountable.</p><p>Another remark: I'd have difficulty committing more than 1 (active) hour to a single game. That kind of thing can happen organically when playing something single-player (or match-based multiplayer), but it's quite daunting to mentally schedule a multi-hour block, and would probably be a barrier to entry for a lot of people. And I'm not sure that you can get the same type of gameplay to work in that small a span of time.</p><p>All that said, I am definitely interested in what you come up with. Even a drastic genre change to accommodate shorter games could be fun and interesting.</p>

                <p>I was preparing to write something myself, but Kobb basically said almost everything I would say.<br>I would just add that I have generally trouble to commit myself to anything non-RL for longer period of time then, say few tens of minutes. Hell, I have issue even with RL things with that. There's still something going on around me, and in my free time, I have sudden urges to do something every now and then and I want to act on them, not suppress them. That's what free time is for, after all, at least for me. All in all, I never know what exactly I will want to do next hour and that's why I'm generally avoiding most of the multiplayer games, IRC channels and other things that I feel are making me to check them constantly. And that's why I like MUSH because it's perfect for checking game once every two hours or so, when I don't want to be around, or refresh every minute, if I want to be around.</p><p>But I'm definitely interested in seeing, if you come up with something from a non-player perspective, even if it's not for me.</p>
