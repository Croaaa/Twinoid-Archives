                <p>So there was an AP recently where a frustrated, wanted to hunt Mush Chao jumped a perfectly healthy ship back to sol after one of the mush flagrantly broke the rules, played against her team, and got the Mush team dead without a struggle extremely early in play.</p><p>Several people readng that AP thread expressed disappointment that Chao didn't pick a way to subtly suicide, rather than ruin that game for others.</p><p>My current game, and yeah, I know I shouldn't talk about the current game, but I won't include any suspensful details - I'm just here to talk about the dead and my pain because of them, and ask about others' opinions and choices.</p><p>So our Hua D1 took a fighter out, and told us not to wait for her. Leave her if we had to move the ship; she'd had a ship before that the commander decided to let the ship die rather than move it away from hunters because she was there, just let her die.</p><p>We told her to get back aboard when she could, we were not killing her. She did, after like 24 hours or so. Later she went on to kill hunters, mostly stay aboard, and when we needed an O2 planet and everyone on astro, she found us one quick quick. Expo went good, we got the air; hunters increased in number.</p><p>She was asked to use the shooter book Paola got from Xyloph, took herself to a turret and wasted the points, said she didn't know what was wrong, she'd gotten 80% chance to hit before but now had only 20% to start, shooter had ruined her ability to hit.</p><p>We explained about shooter and piloting versus shooter and turreting, and she didn't answer. Never spoke again; she stayed in that turret, then probably quite low AP a few cycles later silently took a fighter out. We still had lots of hunters, no one checked, no one noticed, we moved and she of course died.</p><p>I think it's subtle suicide. I think she didn't want to be on our ship, was done with us, and wanted to leave.</p><p>But I haven't reported her yet. And I think I won't, though I think it's reprehensible. Suicide, even subtle suicide, that is playing against your team. You leave others with the guilt, the regret for their part in your death. I loaded that fuel and recommended we jump. The captain jumped us - both our hands have Hua's virtual blood. And Hua gets to be free of us, free of our ship's problems, gets whatever satisfaction her possible martyr complex provides.</p><p>We needed you, Hua. We needed your AP in the race for the cure, we needed your presence, your involvement, you were part of our fragile and damaged team, now more fragile and more damaged from the loss of you. We all make mistakes - mistakes of a human should not lead to that human's death. Atonement, a life of service not further destruction, that is how wrongs are righted.</p><p>So, would people like to discuss? Would you subtly suicide if you wanted off a ship? Do you think subtle suicide breaks the rules? Do you think it -should- break the rules, whether you think it does or not? Would you report subtle suicide?</p>

                <p>The problem is that any good judge isn't going to put thoughts into her mind for her and sanction her based on that.</p><p>Maybe she's fairly new and didn't know that turrets suck compared to patrol ships. Maybe she thought she was helping. Maybe she went out with the intention of killing hunters and lost her internet connection, or got sidetracked by real life or hell, just got sleepy and went to bed.</p><p>Unless you've got someone specifically saying they're going to suicide or making it very, very obvious (loading fuel to move then going out in patrol knowing that the ship is about to move, picking up and dropping items multiple times in a row, etc), it's very likely that the person will be cleared.</p><p>There's simply no way for judges to know what a person's thinking.</p>

                <p>Judges can see logs. And maybe even a person's history? I just report them. I think there was a suicide on my ship too where someone 'accidentally' entered a room and spored in front of a person on the first cycle. That in itself means nothing, but if the person has a history of dying instantly after they get mush, that's sign of suicide.</p>

                <p>MrMuz, judges see logs but not history so they deal with the person on a totally unbiased current ship basis. Mods can see the names and history so we can deal with someone who is showing a pattern.</p><p>I agree with the replies here, this whole premise is based on so many assumptions. Of course you report anyone who you feel has suicided though, explaining thoroughly what you see going on. Let the judges and mods decide.</p>

                <p>If I ever decide to get gold mode, then yea, I would probably think about suicide because as it is now if you get a worthless ship you basicly wasting the gold mode time. With gold people want to achieve bigger goals than they're achieving with Bronze. And if you cant do that then it's a waste of money. 10Eur for a browser based non real time... Is too big of a stretch for me as it is, and if it gets me nowhere... <br> <br>Sure is unethical and all, but whos fault is that?</p><p>If Gold Mode Price would be reduced to 5$ a month then I would never think about that and pay each month. Actually it's the non leaving feeling that all MT wants is that one time quick cash grab from a player, that prevents me from putting in any money atm.<br>I'll probably pay after Castings get done and TUTORIAL gets to an offline ship mode, but I don't see that coming ever.</p><p>I wouldnt report subtle suicide because thats the same thing for the ship as going inactive. Do people report inactives? No. Breaking rules? Again, make it so people wont have to do it and everybody will be happy.</p>

                <p>It's my first day here (and first post) but I'd like to chime in, and agree with nanomed on this. This game was recommended to me without much information, aside from it being a space survival game with interesting characters- so I figured what the hell, the art looked great and I enjoy SS13, so i decided to give it a shot.</p><p>Oddly enough, I actually purchased gold before learning this was a multiplayer game! not that im complaining about that in particular, i much prefer it this way -if only matchmaking was fixed- (also I may not have chosen Jin if I'd known <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">.)</p><p>But seriously this multiplayer aspect was not made clear to me when starting off. Not to mention the fact that the tutorial I played was also part of an -actual- game. This strikes me as a horrible design choice, and that anyone defending it must have some vested interest in glossing over what a mistake it is.</p><p>Over two thirds of our crew is unresponsive- this is intended feature? (yes or no to that, reasons do not matter, just the end result). Many mid tutorial- almost as if they had tried the game for their first time, without even needing to validate e-mail, and not liked it! (madness, who could not like what we like! why bother designing offline tutorials to accommodate this when it would all work if they simply had better taste, amiright?)</p><p>As of now, two other new players and myself are stuck trying figure things out in an empty ship, and there are fires cropping up with people idling in them..</p><p>TLDR; Implement Offline tutorials, or even a passably average anonymous matchmaking service pls, for the love of fucks sake.</p>
