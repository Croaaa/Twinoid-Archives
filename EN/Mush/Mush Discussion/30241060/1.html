                <p>ELEESHA' STORY (Roland has a big schlong, first thing I checked when I possessed him <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>I did not want to deceive but the virus made me... My only instincts were survival and reproduction.<br>Thanks to my wonderful and supportive partner Chao, I managed to get through somehow. There were many heart-stopping moments along the way, sleepless nights, hours of heart palpitations, trembling limbs and stress-induced fever. Thanks to my loud mouth and eagerness to co-operate I managed to infiltrate the human crew and was considered one of the few 'clean' ones on the secret human channel.</p><p>Roland went on a mad Mush-hunt from the minute he set his foot onboard. He never went offline and would observe moving dots on the map 24/7. Chao and I had a hard time infecting our first target, since research was already up and going. We managed to spike Raluca. However, she was not very compliant and made herself an easy suspect very soon.</p><p>Before she did though, Roland had me, Eleesha, track people's movements to check who might have been turned. One yellow stick figure in the crew list turned into two before turning to green, which the ever-observant Roland caught with his hawkeye.</p><p>He asked me to check on Chao and Raluca. My one lie in the game was telling him Chao was clean (he wasn't after having extracted a spore and targeting Raluca with her third). I told him Roland Raluca was dirty but had been working on Pilgred one hour prior - which was of course true.Roland added our whole trio to the clean list.</p><p>Roland's first victim was Stephen. Human. That and his almost maniacal eagerness for the mush-hunt could be perceived as an act to cover up his true self. Terrence said it out loud. Yay, Terrence <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>We had some griefer intruders in our crew. Paola the human ran around the ship hiding strategic items from the crew, hacking into Neron settings and not letting herself become inactive so her title of Communications Officer would be passed on to someone else. She blocked our communications for 3 days straight, sleeping in Bravo Dorm shielded by the also inactive Ian the Pacifist. We let her live a long time, after the first kill Roland was a bit more hesitant <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>Everyone believed she was Mush though while I was outraged even more knowing it was human griefer behavior (which was reported and acted on by Epoq). Loyalty to the cause is number one, as Mush or otherwise, and traitors deserve a bullet in the head....</p><p>....which she received...from Roland.<br>Her death was no big loss to either team. <br>Ian was for some unexplained reason allowed to live on and did absolutely nothing the whole game until he died of starvation. Im pretty sure he was sitting there begging for us to turn him. We refused to turn either of them.</p><p>I became the Comms Officer which put a strain on me... I was stuck trying to catch up on Paola's work. <br>And I was not thrilled about it. Luckily my attempts at accessing Xyloph databases ended with the Sol connection going down. Twice. And people weren't too eager to help me re-instate it... which was ok with me <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I could gather up some much needed AP...</p><p>Raluca messed up our game big-time. She did everything to get caught.<br>She never responded to Janice's questions about Pilgred progress. She seemed very indifferent to the Mush cause. Her mission was to infect Frieda with spore number 3, thus bringing her over to our side. <br>Instead she made herself get caught in a room that she KNEW the mycoalarm was in (thanks to Eleesha's investigative skills). I had kept my team up to date about everything going on in other secret human chats, so it actually felt like Raluca was sabotaging us. And she targeted Finola instead!!!!</p><p>After Raluca's spore-attack, panic broke loose and everyone started scanning themselves, Frieda extracted the two spores. We knew we had no choice but to start playing aggressively now. The humans banded on research and it became impossible to extract / infect with the extractor working and so much backlog that we couldnt get out of.</p><p>We wanted to go out in a blaze of glory.... and get some revenge <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>Chao demoralized Frieda a minute before cycle end - she suicided. Good riddance! You don't want to be a Mush - you die <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>I demoralized Jin Su for 10 at the same time. We were operating from 2 different rooms. We thought, hell let people die, then we go out kamikaze style taking as many down as we can - Chao would mutate, I would transfer into Gioele's body (the only spiked body we still had) and we could still cause some chaos and casualties. <br>Since Roland still trusted me implicitly I hoped I might still get away with it and not have to flee. During that cycle Jin su had been in other rooms so there would be other suspects. <br>Midnight comes.... Frieda dies... Jin Su... doesn't!<br>Ooooooooooh shit! My buzzkill action was crossed out NOT because he was going to be down to 0 but because I only had 1 AP left.</p><p>People notice Frieda's dead. That whole day people had been worried about morale and the possible bug that comes along with the rebel base that's supposed to give +6 morale.... So they had asked Jin su to give them a speech ASAP in the Bravo Dorm, many hours before.... Hua is very low... So is Janice. And of course Frieda had been at 5 and she was now dead...</p><p>So Jin Su is alive.... and I panic make a crucial error, demoralizing him for another two morale... then I realize he won't die for another 3 hours and will alert the crew AND - since that cycle he was only in the room with me - game over!</p><p>Jin Su logs in and doesn't give people the promised speech. He doesn't notice the loss of morale.<br>Roland gets frustrated at him, believing now that Jin Su is stalling and is Mush and the demotivator...<br>I almost cried... now that he was prime Mush suspect... he would die at cycle end and there would be no suspect. Game over again!<br>He'd spent the whole cycle with me and if he suicided as a human... he could not have been responsible for Frieda's death.</p><p>3am came....<br>He DID NOT DIE <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br>Still at 1 morale. This time it's a great thing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> They all hate him! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> They will believe me over him!<br>He screams: "Eleesha did it!" And runs off to find the cat to save himself, wasting all his AP and MP in the process, making people waiting at the Dorm for him even more suspicious.</p><p>Fortunately, he told them I'd demoralized him Day 4, cycle 8... which was the when he actually left the bridge and went to the Lab and where he encountered Frieda who was now dead. Trying to cover his ass by blaming me, obviously <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Calmly, I point out the facts... and question if he is even telling the truth about having low morale.</p><p>The crew swallowed it <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Another close call.... In the end Jin Su gave them the speech, while I kept busy decoding signals to give our humans morale, so they would never suspect me...<br>However, after Jin Su started acting sketchy about moving the ship when the asteroids were about to hit, trigger-happy Roland went to shoot him. Human again! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Suddenly I am suspect number 1. I try to plead my case and act hurt and offended by the whole thing. Tell Roland to shoot me point blank if he really thinks I'm Mush. He backs down and starts looking into the option that Jin-Su has transferred into someone's body, probably Gioele's.</p><p>At the same time Chao and I are busy strategizing. Should we organize an expo ASAP and try to leave a group of 4 behind by flying away - thus blowing cover but getting an uppper-hand? Do we let Eleesha-now-human-after transferring into Roland's body just before the expo-with very low perish on the expo so the Mush live on? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>Should we hide oxygen with Chao stalling to land on a planet? Decisions ,decisions.</p><p>Meanwhile, they have found the serum and are deciding who to cure - me still included in the super-duper-clean-secret chat. I suggest the flying-under-the-radar-Gioele-that-might-have-been-possessed-by-JinSu, but also offered to be the first one up if that would make Roland feel safer... Total bluff of course. I would NEVER let them cure me!!!</p><p>However decisions had to be made fast. The serum threat was hanging over my head. I knew Roland did not trust me anymore and I was sure he was planning to use it on me. The final plan was to get a planet expedition going (which was becoming a reality with oxy running low) and me going with the humans. Chao would shoot me in the face a couple of times to get my HP really low, then I would head to Icarus bay, search for mycoalarms, infect Roland and trasfer, then quickly launch us. And if Roland managed to alert the crew of the swap, Chao would change ship's course and abandon us. -3 humans and a Mush with now-swapped-glory. <br>And if Roland-now-Eleesha didn't come online and notice, Eleesha's body would hopefully perish in the expedition and no one would have to know...</p><p>However... Roland and Terrence rushed to repair Pilgred. And the impatient Chao with sucky triumph points was itching to get back to Sol with the virus onboard. He was a great companion, my rock, my shoulder to cry on. So I asked him for a couple of minutes in which to sneak up on Roland, spike him and transfer. Then I messaged the code word 'boobs' as the new Roland and Chao set us off to Sol....</p><p>The Mush live on....</p>

                <p>The same thing that made others trust her enough to kill Jin Su rather than her when he accused her - she did everything she was asked and all of her AP was very visibly going towards things that helped the humans and hurt the mush.

                <p>Every Mush that gets back to Sol means -10 glory to the humans. It's even a bigger penality than loosing the Humanity Last Hope Chun... I think that must mean something (even if glory by itself is not enough to judge how the game went).</p>
