                <p>Hello, I was recently on a ship as Jin Su and the first few days were going rather well until real life happened. My grandfather suddenly had an accident and I had to take care of him (Just went to him right now as well). This caused some stress and I was not very active and made a few light and one big mistake (Scanning an entire planet even though we already had found one). Obviously this resulted in an argument and I explained that I had problems in real life. I even told them that they could kill me on a specific day, when I would not return (this day hasn't arrived yet, though). I tried to be as active as possible, however: When i logged on just now I was killed and saw literally dozens of chat messages from Stephen who called me names and insulted me because I was "inactive and a worthless pile of crap" (roughly). I reported him for flaming. <br>Now my question: I was online at least once every cycle and tried to do something when I was not sleeping (for 3 cycles in this night). Were the killing and the subsequent insults justified or not?</p><p>Thanks in advance for the answer, I might not reply soon though for obvious reasons.</p>

                <p>What Stephen did there is clearly reportable. Okay, Jin Su Needs high activitiy but you told them that you had no time right now instead of just vanishing and sometimess you just have to do RL Stuff. Sleeping, working, going to school or things like what happend to you and as it sounds you where not inactive for to long.<br>Best wishes from my to your grandfather, I hope he will recover soon.</p>

                <p>Commander is crucial role for the ship! So yeah... Crew can kill you to get a better commander. Cause most of the time it can help crew to survive a flight. It's really does not matter why are you can't play your role but:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> If you have problems in your real life it's better to <em>become idle</em> (no actions). Cause crew will get a new capitan and can get some privileges after selling you. <strong>And most important:</strong> You will be able to concentrate on your Real Life which is much more important then the game. <br><strong>2.</strong> Insulting people is never a good thing. Even if someone trying to RP a character you can write him in private to stop abusing you. And if he refuse you can definitely <em>report him!</em></p>

Stephen and some other people were very wrong with what they said in chat...<br>But we had to kill you to survive. Hull was down to 17%, when I finally managed to hack the terminal and move us from attackers. So they decided - if Jin Su will be idle for just one more time (and I will very likely happen, because your previous mistakes made hull drop from 70 to 17), we will all die - better to kill him and pass title to Gioele.</p><p>As people said in the thread - if you need to be idle - just get idle status asap. But you were holding critical important title in the critical situation.</p>

Reported for picking up the item, reported for language, reported for absent for a longer time, reported for anything that can be interpreted as working against your own team, and that can be ANYTHING you did or failed to do, really. Even walking out of the room without a reason can be interpreted as a waste of ap, when they could have gone into something productive.</p><p>Nice concept of a game but ruined by reporting system and interference by the SDF.</p><p>Good games should have as little rules as possible, for instance, linking to pornography sites and exploiting the game, by messing with the code, etc. Been playing MMOs for my whole life and never had any problems, anywhere except in this game.

                <p>It's free. And the concept is good, it's just ruined by reporting system, too much interference from the outside world, no real freedom because of it and the worst community and players I've ever seen. This can easily be changed and improved. Perhaps I'm hoping for the game to improve, if if does not, well goodbye then. There's plenty of games out there when one can leave his money.</p>

And yes you can be killed for doing odd actions on a ship, but it is kinda part of the game. The whole point is to not act suspicious while the mush are around so you don't get mistaken as one of THEM, but after they are dead you can work as a team to move your ship to victory. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Wasting AP i'm pretty sure is not a punishable offence unless you are doing it in large quantities and to nothing but the detriment to the crew. The game is about number crunching and information so you need to use your AP/MP wisely and keep in contact with your crew, or some of the crew will get annoyed. You can always communicate to figure out the best way to spend your time and resorces. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>If you get reported and you have no idea why you should ask, the moderators seem quite happy to answer questions, and participate in conversations. If your getting in trouble for active negativity ask why, maybe its from harassing someone for a thing they did that they can no longer change or correct, maybe it is because your saying that everyone is doing their job wrong but not explaining why you think that, or maybe it is because you are just repeatedly saying that the crew is crap. You will just not know until you ask, but you should probably be able to guess where you stepped over the line. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"></p>

That's usually a no-point sanction that's appropriately titled "Language". Active Negativity comes for things like killing multiple people on your team for no valid reason. And it's a rather rare sanction to give out, at that.</p><p>So if you're building those sanctions up, you need to look at your play, not the rules.</p><p>Shit, if I see a human killing a human in a report, the first thing I do is look to see if the person communicated a valid thought process behind it... either in PM or on the wall. If that's not the case, I look at the newly dead person's actions to see if they were dirty or had done anything that could be misconstrued as mushy. If you actually manage to get a "negativity" (either active or passive) sanction, it's because you clearly did something wrong and directly violated the biggest rule of the game: do not play against your own team.</p><p>But hey, that's just logic and fact. Who needs those silly things when you can pretend you got quarantined for an insult or two?</p>

I tended the plants anyway while scanning for possible 02 planets, and one of the humans who took the O2 capsules to hurry our suffocation reported me for whatever reason and I got the <strong>7 days ban</strong>. I never killed anyone on that ship and once used the word "idiot" in 16 days in context "You, idiot, why did you do that?". Reason given: active negativity. I was so actively negative that we reached day 16. So yeah, this game sucks.</p>

Call the whole comunity the worst one <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Let's look how that person is playing. Last game <em>Quarantined by NERON</em>?! Oh, what's why you think that reporting sux?! Cause you were reported several times and after desicion of moderator you were Quarantined? Well it's not a game design it just you... playing poorly.</p></cite><p>Everyone who doesn't share your opinions about an online browser game doesn't have to be a troll, you know? I have far better uses with my spare time that to annoy some teenagers.</p><p>Getting banned by using the game's mechanics is what makes a poorly designed game. For instance if I take a Mush sample and withhold it or hide it before the ship fills and get banned for it, that's considered negative play and is a design flaw. They've fixed this with the update so apparently now the sample is spawned when the ship fills. Bravo! One less rule to worry about. Now if the game was better designed we wouldn't need 564 rules to worry about and 10x that many forum threads "can I do that, can he do this, is this allowed, can I report this?". The crew would deal with any kind of selfish behavior by themselves without the interference of the outside world, the judges.</p>

                <p>Just as somebody can disagree with yours without being wrong.</p><p>Consider this: What if we eliminated all the laws in society today? No "official" rules against stealing or murdering, just let people sort that all out by themselves. Now, how does it feel to be the guy being stolen from? Or the widow who just had her husband killed for no reason at all? Sure they can have revenge, but wouldn't they rather it have just not happened in the first place?</p><p>What about the guy who just wandered into this city, only to have his car stolen and to have his money taken at gunpoint? Do you think he'd stick around if he had a choice?</p><p>The rules are there to make it an enjoyable experience for everyone. There should be just two general rules: don't play against your team, and don't be a douchecanoe. But because some people can't follow such simple ideas, there need to be clear rules on what is and is not okay, so they can be told exactly WHY they got in trouble. It also allows people who simply didn't know or who made a mistake to face the consequences of that one time and get back into the game. It is repeated offenses of ruining the game for somebody else that gets you banned.</p><p>Sure we can let people duke it out, but that just encourages griefers. The ship becomes a chaotic mess with people dying left and right or unable to finish important projects because of ONE person. And the one person did it on purpose, even though it was against both the spirit and the letter of the rules of the game, and probably doesn't care that they'll die because of it. They take pleasure in messing things up for other people, so they will continue doing it unless there is a system in place to stop them.</p><p>There are no AI players here. We're all real people, with real emotions. Sometimes we make mistakes, because nobody is perfect. And we all would just like to enjoy a small game of Mush without some jerkwad ruining it.</p>

The ships are in no way related. On the next ship I'll be the next person, with a new job, there will be new problems to overcome, a clean slate. How will my actions in the 1st ship affect my actions in another? Mine won't but the quarantine will, as I've said in the previous post. SDF fucks the next ship, not me. <br>I'm sure many of these problems now called "griefing" can be solved with a bit more intelligent game mechanics design, but the developers are too lazy or to unimaginative to solve them. Like the withholding the crucial items scenario - can be easily solved with a character skill that for instance has the ability to make people drop things, or a steal skill, or something, What is now considered griefing and gets people banned plus ruins the experience for everyone, could be made solvable entirely by crew without the interference of SDF and would actually ADD something to the gameplay.</p>

                <p>Right, by giving griefers more tools to use against people who just want to play the game. Chun holding onto the hacker kit for safekeeping? WHOOPS now it's mine oh no what if the mush take it from me~</p><p>Also while you rant on about "outside forces" controlling the punishments, remember that a lot of the mods have or still do play the game themselves. After all, they can't be good judges of what impairs gameplay if they never get in game. As long as they never handle reports on characters in a game they personally were in, you are getting the decision of an active member of the community who doesn't have a personal stake in the matter while still having access to all the information necessary (what you did, what you typed, and what other people did and typed that could have influenced you).</p><p>If you see a fly in the soup, do you just go "oh well, I'll just make sure to check my bowl before eating and everything will be fine"? No, you tell people. Because you don't want a fly in your soup, and you know that other people don't want a fly in THEIR soup. Maybe they have to throw out that pot of soup and it's wasted, but at least nobody else had to deal with their soup ruined, and that fly won't be back in the next pot of soup.</p><p>But I'm starting to get the sense that you aren't listening to anything that doesn't agree with what you've already decided: that the developers are just lazy and that we're a bunch of overcoddled whiners keeping you from your happy pretendy funtimes because we didn't like something you said. So I won't be arguing further. If you're this toxic on the ships you were playing on, no wonder people reported you.</p>

I suggest a slogan for Mush - be a min-maxer or don't join this game! If you deviate from the very strict rules we all follow as gospel (which make every game the same), you will suffer our wrath! lol</p><p>Again I must mention die2nite - beginner towns + advanced (distant) towns + hardcore towns + PRIVATE towns. Play in whichever one you find yourself most comfortable, and I've never seen a moderator act. You can go full retard if you want. We're having a guy just now griefing and stealing the hacksaw, hanged him and tomorrow going to pickup it off his corpse. Everything is dealt with inside of the town. If one person can fuck up your game using the game mechanics again - bad design.</p><p>You probably like more controlled environments, someone always watching over you, and that's OK. I don't, I like freedom. Since it takes almost a full day to fill a ship I think a lot of people prefer their freedom.</p>

                <p>I don't like the quarantine rule either, I think that it spoils the game more for the other players than the person being quarantined. I would like it to be more used as a last resort when someone get entirely removed from the game and told to never come back, and a player who gets sanctioned instead has a forced downtime between their next ships or something like that. However i disagree with everything else, the report system a necessary part of the game to remove players who cannot keep the game a fun experience. Playing against your team is a real issue as some players would rather be on one side or the other or would like to give up early to get into a new game, and to keep the game fair for everyone involved this has to not happen.</p><p>With-holding crucial equipment is not report-able if you plan to do something with it that benefits your team, however with-holding crucial equipment while running around and doing stuff that doesn't require the equipment could be considered playing against your team if you do not release it over several days of people shouting at you to let it go. I don't think there is anything wrong with picking up and keeping crucial equipment during natural play as you don't know which team you will be on and therefor have active reason to keep the equipment and are not playing against your team. Its all about context of the action, and whether your playing to benefit your team or not.</p><p>Also if you add mechanics in so the players can sort out problems that a player is causing, then that still doesn't deal the player causing the problem. They have to be dealt with by a punishment of some sort and having the players being able to punish other players would cause even more problems</p><p>Finally the ONLY outside interaction right now is the quarantine rule as their is no way for the SDF to know about your actions until after the ship you did the actions on is finished. You don't know the user names or your crew mates so cant judge what they are like from their previous ships. All the events are managed by an RNG so there is no GM choosing what will happen next.</p><p>Are you sure that threatening to stop tending the plants is all you did, their might have been something else that happened, so you should still ask before passing judgment. Also if your having issues with starvation and everyone else didn't know about it then you cant fault them for that. You could of just asked them for help in getting healed up and then if they don't you will have to run and heal yourself, and leave the plants, saying you need help with the plants now. They will learn to listen soon enough, or else nobody is going to get bananas or oxygen and nobody is going back to sol. Work with your team to help them learn to help you, preferably without threats and you will get through to them, no insults needed. If you want a better community, be a better part of the community and people will follow suit. (also this is the second time i have started to talk like Ian when someone is on a rant in the last month)</p>

The SDF are not part of the ship, they are outside authority. And what is most stupid of all, you get quarantined in the middle of your next ship, totally unrelated to prior one, which once again screws that ship which loses one of it's perhaps crucial members.</cite><p>"Not part of the ship," huh? Did you forget that <strong>I</strong> was present on the ship in which you got quarantined? You even commented in its AP thread.</p><p>Also, more often than not, people who grief on one ship will get quarantined before they can deal serious damage to their next ship. But as you already know, reports don't get looked at until <strong>after</strong> the ship on which they were reported has ended. This gives us the complete context of their actions. Someone who may have been thought to be a griefer on Day 1-2 might start communicating, be very useful to the ship, and still be a useful player past Day 10. If we looked at the report without that full context, you can see how that could be more disruptive to ships in progress.</p>

                <p>Mush isn't a MMO either, it's more like a board game similar to Mafia or Werewolf, which is why you have rules that are more restrictive than a MMO. You aren't playing solo here, you're in a team with 15 other people. There isn't a cookie cutter way to win that everyone has to follow, but if you go and waste your AP for no good reason, you are actively hurting your team, as the game gets harder with time and AP spent.<br>If you think people are wasting your time by refusing to play the way you want to, think about how many people's time you are wasting when you refuse to play the way they want to (following the official rules). Therefore, if you don't like the rules, I suggest you do something more productive with your time than griefing here. Learn some programming and make your own game, perhaps? Then you also get to make all the rules you want.</p>

Many of the clarifications and finer points of the rules have been deliberated upon in great detail by us, in order to make a fairer (and ultimately more fun) game for both teams. That includes the rule about neutral play, and not holding critical items before Mush selection. If you're holding something to give your team (or yourself) an advantage, you're explicitly <em>not</em> respecting neutral play.</p><p>Also, just because you <strong>CAN</strong> take a particular course of action, does not mean that course of action is <strong>justifiable</strong>, much less within the rules.</p><p>Sure, you can change the BIOS settings as a human, and throw two grenades in a crowded Dorm...but you would also have to expect to be killed, then reported and sanctioned as a griefer. You could, as a human, take off with both extinguishers, and be killed when the ship moves. Again, you should expect to be reported and sanctioned for that, too. You have the "freedom" to be an asshole and a griefer...but you do not have the freedom to take those actions without some consequences.</p>

And should those consequences extend to outside the game (as they only seem to with severe or repeated examples of this behavior), all the better.</p><p>That said, most of the actions used as griefing are possible because they allow people to make mistakes. If it wasn't possible to make mistakes or poor decisions as a human, this game would be far too easy. What if they made it impossible to fight other humans, or attacks between two humans do 0 damage? Then each ship would just turn into a brawl, with humans just looking to see who dies to find their mush, and the mush just trying to kill as many people as possible before they are outed.</p><p>No, the game isn't perfect, but that's why we have a forum: so people can air concerns like this. That's why the mush sample and first mage book now only spawn after the mush are chosen, and why you aren't allowed to hide things or print the List before then either. Unfortunately, witholding the weapons before then would make inventory pointless, and that means you would literally have nothing to do except sit around until the ship is full.</p>

                <p>PILGRED no, because it could be used for harmful return to Sol (by mush or by griefers), and most of the available research is not terribly useful (Mycoscan is also not neutral). Neron projects and planet scanning are possible and sufficiently neutral, but they are big AP sinks; people tend to save their AP until they know which side they are on or so they can find the mush sample and book easily.</p><p>You could pretty much gather pots to start the garden as early as possible and take down the extra shower for the sofa. If you have to reinventory everything anyway to keep weapons out of mush hands, there's no point in wasting the AP the first time; you can just stop when you find the sample the way it is now.</p>

                <p>I've never been so wronged in my gaming experience, but heres an example of an unjustified sanction. I was playing as Jin Su and I attacked Roland because he killed Terrence.

I killed many hunters and relayed research efficiently. I was far by the most helpful player. It was because of me (and Chun.. and Terrence) that the ship still managed to complete Antispore Gas and Mycos by day 2, because our Andie went bronze pilot.</p><p>It was a promising ship until Roland griefed Terrence. He was 99% human and very experienced. He was one of the 3 players (including me) that never went into Bravo Dorm (for possible shower). He also co-ordinated research with me in whisper to maximise efficiency, and he also did alot of tech work and mush-hunting discussion. After Roland killed Terrence, I knifed Roland a few times (but didn't kill), then stayed in the Medlab as I had Torn Tongue.</p><p>Soon after the incident, I started another promising voyage. I got quarantined, and the ship got ruined as a result, as I was the only active and efficient pilot. I asked the SDF ASAP and they only replied me about <strong>1.5 days after</strong>. They said I griefed on my previous ship. Man how true was that. And sadly even though I explained and prompted the SDF several times, the case is still unjustified, and my SDF points havent been removed. 9 days have passed. Since then I've quit the game. The game was good but the SDF was dictating as hell IMO.</p>

And trust me, I knew it was a special one.<br>So I avoided jumping in on what Kamen said - after <strong>13</strong> days I know there's no reasoning with him - but I feel specially capable of responding to dexter's complaints. Maybe he’s getting his ships mixed up, because so much of what he said about the Roland-killed-Terrence ship is dead wrong. Specifically:<br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_2401411 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="2401411">dexter</span></span><cite><br> I <strong>was far by the most helpful player</strong>.

Can't even claim 'neutral play', you were the last one up. That really pissed me off when I found about it, since earlier that day you made me give you my ration so you would be able to relay. That ration was the only reason you were able to help the Frieda-led push to complete ASG.</p><p>Andie was a GOLD player, had all of his first three skills the entire time you were around. Now he was definitely one of the most helpful players on that ship.</p><p>For the record, Terrence was helpful but also abrasive; yes, Roland's killing him was extremely stupid. But afterwards not only did we confirm Roland was Human, it became obvious he wasn’t a griefer, just an idiot. So you going vigilante on him was even worse than what he had done. And this is coming from the guy Roland said he wanted dead next. After that, you never spoke again. Torn Tongue makes sense, but you still went inactive because you lost your title. Then four days later, our psycho Chun randomly killed you. But you might have been killed sooner if you hadn’t gone inactive, since you had that destructive habit of eating one of our pill every few cycles. You single-handedly ate just about <em>all of them</em>. MVP? Lolno. At least Roland was useful after his screw-up .</p><p>I'm not saying you deserved a quarantine for that alone, but in this case I don't see any reason to argue with the SDF's judgement.</p>

                <p>Actually I did read the discussion channel, but not all of it. I didn't see that he was human. Too long ago, but I think I did. I saw his stupid reasons for killing Terrence so I went to attack Roland and because I failed to kill him I gave up on the ship.</p><p>I never knew that purely giving up is against the rules. I only thought it was against the rules if I deliberately went inactive <strong>to harm the ship</strong>, but because I never had any intention to harm the ship, I never expected I would be quarantined because of that. In fact, I came back after a few days when I was finally appeased, only to see that i was dead. I was genuinely trying to help the ship do research, piloting and whatnot, until Terrence was killed.</p><p>Also because of this I quit the game for a few months.</p><p>edit: I was really shocked when I was quarantined on my next ship, as I sincerely thought I finally had a clean slate after I stopped playing selfishly. Then boom. Suddenly I was quarantined like wtf?</p>
