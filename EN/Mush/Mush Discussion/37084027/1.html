                <p>Hello, everyone.<br>I got Neron ban. What`s a problem? Thats ok if I break rules. But let`s discuss how was it in real ship...</p><p>First of all, I was a Gioele and got <em>Junky</em> skill so I ask everyone do not drink and even make a coffee. I ask it three times. And in second day our Kuan Ti go to kitchen and drink it. Then he come and stay idle in A-Bay for few cycles.</p><p>What have I see? - Player waste food AP and do nothing and do not want to return in room with camera. So he got bonus AP and want to be spiked.</p><p>I do not belive then he is out of PM.<br>* He drink a coffee so he can exchange PA -&gt; PM if he need so.<br>* He can plan his PM actions before move out of dorm.</p><p>I say all of this in private chanel with some players(include Chun) before killing and wait over 2 cycles.</p><p>So... He was a human. Then Mush run and kill me(screeming something like "behavour" ) and when kill me ask report me in comments.</p><p>I do not ask then moderators clear this ban or recover me 20 glory which I lost as Alfa mush in my last ship(1 oxy left, There were Roland with 2 spores(+8 glory for full convert), Chun(+7 glory for death and +3 per killing) and Ian so I just need convert Roland, kill Chun and take one oxy from Tank for get +8 glory for mush winning). It is ok if this is not in game rules. I start this topic not for this...<br>_____<br>And now real reason for it. Mush must be mush - they can`t reveal themself etc. Human need not stay human if it is posible.</p><p>* Mush can say where is traps for you can be convert when see then ship is near end( in any chat! ) - this is on game rules.<br>* You can eat and wait spiking - this is on game rules.<br>etc.</p><p>If you want to be beta-mush - players should let you be... If they want to stop it - then got Neron ban.</p><p>Let`s discuss.</p>

                <p>I don't see much to discuss here.</p><p>It's against the rules to play against your team. So, human can't declare his intention to become the beta mush. That's sanctionable.</p><p>But if he just stays in the room without camera and wastes APs (on such a small scale like is this one coffee, I'm not talking about cooking all rations and such) then it's just suboptimal play.<br>Unless he said in the chat, he's going to stand in the Alpha Bay and wants mush to come to him and spike him, he's just doing mistake. That may be reportable (since judges will see if he PMed to the mush with request of being infected), but is not sanctionable, if there wasn't such declaration of intention.</p>

                <p>Ok, I was on that first ship and while it wasn't me that reported you I can understand why whoever did, did report you.</p><p>1: Someone being dirty and idle in either Bravo-Bay or Alpha-Bay-1 doesn't make them mush. 9 times out of 10 it makes them a dumbass that can't count mp. Yes it's a reason to watch someones behaviour. It's not good enough to kill them without more evidence.</p><p>Killing an "idle" player who has been "idle" for less than 2 cycles is also not on, especially when that is the basic crux of your argument against them besides <strong>"HE STOLE MY COFFEE!"</strong> Most people work/sleep for longer than 2 cycles at a time.</p><p>As for your idiotic theory that he was intentionally trying to get himself spiked so he could become mush. Even if both mush had spiked him while he was idle in those 2 cycles - he would still have been a human. <strong>So without evidence of mush activity - you knowingly murdered a human....</strong> simply because he drank your coffee.</p><p><strong>Murdering inactives for being inactive is against the rules.</strong> Not that you can even claim that someone being idle for 2 or 3 cycles is inactive. The SDF haven't even made a rule about Gioele not being allowed to murder someone who drinks their coffee because they probably hadn't expected anyone to be that much of a dumbass.</p><p>-</p><p>2: Simply posting once in a private conversation that you noticed someone is idle in an area without a camera doesn't then give you carte blanche to murder that person without repercussions. You need to establish a consensus first.</p><p>You didn't ask us whether we should kill him. You simply reported that Kuan Ti was idle in AB1 while dirty. <strong>No-one in that private chat, myself included, was expecting you to suddenly murder Kuan Ti.</strong> All of us would have told you to wait if you'd bothered to ask us.</p><p>-</p><p>3: Given that at the time Kuan Ti was our only active astrophysicist who was clearly an active player murdering him without real cause definitely looked like mush activity on your part. When you died and weren't mush, that's when people started talking about reporting you.</p><p>-</p><p>4: Given your repeated posting of <strong>"HE STOLE MY COFFEE"</strong> in Kuan Ti's death thread I can quite easily see how both whoever reported you and the SDF saw you as trolling / griefing. Next time actually write the reasons you killed them and then finish with ".... plus he drank my coffee" if you want to roleplay.</p><p>And I call rubbish on your "roleplay" anyway. Gioele is meant to be paranoid (you even had that skill). There was no reason at all in that case for you to not list all of the reasons you had for killing him.</p><p>-</p><p>tldr; You were intentionally uncommunicative with the crew as to why you'd just murdered an active - useful human player and looked like you were actively trying to troll the players demanding to know why by complaining about your coffee.</p><p>Even after Hua had begun stabbing you you didn't list your reasons but simply tried to explain why you couldn't be mush. It took her two cycles to kill you. You had plenty of time to explain your reasons for the murder beyond <strong>"HE STOLE MY COFFEE!"</strong> but you never bothered.</p><p><strong>Next time, try communicating more.</strong> <br>I'd probably recommend <strong>not killing</strong> the ship's only astrophysicist for drinking a coffee too.</p>

Should I repeat then there are no reasons for discuss my ban? I agree it.<br>3. I just say then anyone(!) now can play to stay mush as fast as he can and noone can stop it(if don`t want to take ban). There are no rule then human should avoid mush transform. So it easy to become mush and fast finish... or get Bad Sol End. You can`t prove then player want to be a mush. You just can`t.</p>

                <p>A few clarifications before you continue to make a fool out of yourself.</p><p>1. No human can choose to be Mush. If you suspect that someone is trying to be Mush, you can report that person.<br>2. The notion that trying to stop a human from becoming Mush will result in a ban is outright false. If you a reason to believe someone is trying to grief the ship by setting himself up to join the other side, that is a legitimate reason to kill that person.<br>3. Although you claim you are not trying to appeal your quarantine, you are clearly misinforming people by pretending you were unjustly quarantined and for pretending you even know why you got the quarantine in the first place.</p>

                <p>I hate ppl who kill active and usefull player whitout a <strong>REAL</strong> reason. There is no reson to kill someone just because he/she is dirty for a longer period of time / he/she was standing for 1-2 cycles in a room without camera / drink the coffee wich Gioele wants!</p><p>I got killed by an over eager Stephen as Chao even though I was a proven human in one of my ships, here is his quote (more or less): "I got suspicious of Chao because he was dirty for 2 days, so I killed him but he wasn't Mush." This guy killed me because I was dirty, but I had told <strong>EVERYONE</strong> in the dirty thread that I got dirty eating <strong><em>2</em></strong> foodstuffs on the bridge as I was helping with comms and that I won't shower unless I <strong>REALLY</strong> need to because I only get 8 AP per day. I had shooter, survivalist, wrestler and Pilot as skill (Pilot from a book) and the whole crew really liked my activity and helpfullness on the ship (I was a planned Pilot for expos and an Extra-Pilot to take out Hunters because we already had 4 Pilots). I relayed and helped where I could.</p><p>Do you see the connections? Your Kuan Ti and I where helpfull to the ship and the crew and got killed because of <strong>MINOR</strong> reasons (because of wrong place, drinking Coffee or being dirty for a longer time), by someone who <strong>NEVER</strong> stated good reasons or reasons at all to other ppl in the first place (Stephen <strong>NEVER</strong> told someone that he planned to kill me!)!</p><p>So I can understand why you got killed <strong>AND</strong> reported, because <strong>YOU</strong> hurt the ship far more than your Kuan Ti did. Heck as far as I have read it Kuan was an <strong>REALLY</strong> important player on the ship and you just killed him because of such <strong>MINOR</strong> mistakes! If you find it ok to kill player because of such reasons than you could kill more than half of the random ships you play on, if not far more! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> "Oh he was standing in front corridor for more than 2 cycles and he drank my coffee! He has to be Mush, or is at least turned/tries to get turned! Oh look there is someone standing in the Nexus for more than 2 cycles and waiting for an relay/someone who will turn him/someone wich he could spore! <strong>MUSH!</strong>"</p><p>You did something stupid (killed someone without <strong>REAL</strong> evidence), get killed for it and then you ask us what the problem was? If you would think a bit about what you did you would come to the conclusion that your actions were just plain bad for the ship and without <strong>ANY</strong> reason and that the killing/reporting was the right thing to do for the crew! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p>

In other words, that list contains merely <em>examples</em> of which you can report someone for. While you happen to be right that there is no rule against staying alone in a room without a cam, that's only because that by itself proves nothing. Perfect example: On a ship with three cameras, the most likely places for the cameras are the dorms and the Bridge, Lab, or Medlab. What is Raluca to do about it? Stay in a room with a camera so she can slowly die from depression? Obviously, you cannot make it a rule that all humans have to stay under camera.</p>

For me this is good anoth - I can hold human glory first and become mush some time later.</cite><p>But there is something wich gives away someone who is <strong>ACTIVELY</strong> trying to get turned: Staying often/for longer periods of time in rooms where many ppl are walking through. And you can report someone wich you <strong>STRONGLY</strong> suspect, who is trying to get turned. The judges can see it more clearly if the person <strong>REALLY</strong> tried to get turned or if he just had no AP/MP left to move into a room with a camerea. And there are players who act as a bait for the Mush hunting team (and they have talked about it with their team in a private chat): Yes they are trying to get <strong>SPORED</strong>, but they are not trying to get turned. Do you want to kill/report them too?</p>

                <p>Also, if you do not communicate with crew and don't stay in a protected area even when asked to do so, crew can think you already ARE a mush. If the ships consensus is that you are mush and you get killed, there is no valid reason which you could use to report them.<br>So this tactic might work on an inactive or semi inactive ship, but not on an active ship.</p><p>If you stand in an unprotected area for a whole day, it doesn't matter for what reason (RL issues, connectivity problems etc), you'll be suspected for being mush ... Also if you get turned while you are away from keyboard, it's not that hard to see unless the alpha mush takes anonymush right away.</p><p>I'd say, don't underestimate other players just because you were lucky once or few times.</p>

They will look like normal players who do they job well. For example in ship 3290 I ask do not kill anyone hold and I really belive then can bring most of them to Sol as Mush... but Paola was isterical player who kill Frieda when I ask do not... then Raluca come to kill her... and Paola kill her back... then Roland come and kill her... all this time I screem then they should not kill anyone and then everyone of them is not a mush at all... but they do not listen.</p>

If a player is idling in a dangerous spot for days (and gets turned into Mush) and then they suddenly become super-active, that would certainly be suspicious, so feel free to report such behaviour with the comment about what you noticed.

                <p>Hopefully there won't be a word limit for all this.</p><p>Necro, I first want to start off by saying I looked at your Gioele game - and I <em>believe you</em>. I would likely have thought that, given your description and what I see - Kuan-ti could possibly have wanted to be converted. I'm a paranoid person by nature and I would have agreed with you that him doing that was strange. However I still would have reported you over him. <em>Don't get agitated and say im missing the point yet, im getting to it.</em></p><p>Kuan-ti was a proven human from the sounds of it, and you killed him. Regardless of what I personally suspected Kuan's intentions of being that made you <em>play against your team</em> in the rules. You understand and accept that so we won't focus on it like some people did earlier, however you seem to want the rules either expanded or reworded to avoid paranoia inducing situations like what Kuan-ti caused. That is a terrible idea.</p><p>As it stands the rules are fairly broad in saying "Don't play against your team" and can cover a wide range of things. By adding more and restricting movement or actions it gimps players unnecessarily. In the thread people said to simply report those who you have suspicions of playing against their team (like Kuan, in that instance); you counter with saying that you'll, in turn, get in trouble for reporting without reason. What you aren't accounting for is that the SDF is <em>very</em> good at their job. Here's an example that I'm not too proud to talk about:</p><p>I use to play Paola all the time, I felt that it was a very helpful character that can do a great deal on the ship especially with Biologist. I ended up on a ship that had three french players - a Jin Su, a Chao, and an Eleesha. I strongly suspected from the beginning that they jumped together because they all operated in synch perfectly and Jin Su seemed to speak for the other two (who said nothing but just acted). This is fine and dandy but I really did not get along with Jin. I disagreed with his views and he was verbally abusive often and would insult people too easily. We eventually cleared away the Mush but ended up in a very poor situation...</p><p>You see, we had a day's worth of O2, but too few people to work on Pilgred. There were no engineers, not many people left that were active and the leader was doing a piss-poor job organizing to get things done. I did some number crunching and realized it was <em>almost</em> impossible to repair Pilgred before suffocation started kicking in. Naturally I was pissed, I spent clix on food and tried micromanaging as best I could the entire game and now we were going to lose from friggin' O2 loss. Worse still it would take JUST long enough to make me miss a Mush Jump I wanted in on. So my idea was to ask Stephen (who I semi-befriended and argued with Jin often the entire ship) to kill me. He rightly refused. So I took the hacker kit, changed pilot settings and took off in a ship. Now here's where it gets interesting.</p><p>After some arguing and cursing with Jin su over the chat and both of us apologizing - I came back on the ship. I took care to not harm anything by me leaving (I even told Chun where the hacker kit was before I left). I went back to work on Pilgred and something magic happened - we all came together, fixed it and got back to Sol.</p><p><em>WHAT THE HELL DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?</em></p><p>Lots. After a few days I got an SDF message saying they are giving me a point due to my actions on that ship. Reason: <em>Playing against your team</em>. I didn't commit suicide, and I left in the most painless way possible and eventually came back. And if you looked at the logs you'd see I did more than probably most everyone else on that ship to help the humans. However, the SDF aren't robots. You said yourself Necro, they are people and even though I really didn't break that rule in the end, my actions showed I had the blatant intent to do so at one point and they rightly punished me for it. I don't think you are giving them credit enough for their job.</p><p>I see questionable things all the time Necro. I had a Mush Roland in my last ship charge a Raluca on day 2 and mutate to kill her...while there was no suspicion on him and we had three technicians on the ship. A borderline inactive Paola was his partner and his death message was that there wasn't much else he could really do. To me, that was like Mush suicide. I'm sure you'd agree - but I didn't report him. These things happen, and if you have a personality where you <em>must</em> report everyone you have a <em>slight</em> hunch might be playing against their team - then maybe you should lay off the report button or play another game. Not trying to sound mean, but if you get in trouble for too many reports - maybe you are a bit too paranoid for Mush. No offense and sorry for the wall of words everyone.</p>
