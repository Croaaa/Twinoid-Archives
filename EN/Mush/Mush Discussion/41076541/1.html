                <p>Oh, these were a <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1423">good times</a>. I chose Terrence because role-playing him looked like a fun and Robotics Expert seemed like a nice skill. Of course, I didn't know, how hard it is to get some scraps for building and upgrading drones.</p><p>My first day started poorly. After doing a tutorial, I had tons of AP and didn't know what to do with them. Since tutorial teached me only how to search for things, repair doors, shoot hunters from turret and cook food, and there were nothing broken to repair, no hunters outside and I wasn't sure what I should search for, I just spend all my starting APs cooking bunch of rations. I was genuinly thinking I'm helping the crew with that, because I didn't know there is anything like food destruction or spoiling of cooked rations. How surprised I was when shortly after that half a ship started panic, that "Terrence just destroyed all our food". I was confused, ashamed and didn't know what to say those 15 strange people, that I just kept my silence waiting for them to kill me, trying to look useful at least with my actions.<br>Surprisingly, the lynch mob didn't come and I was alowed to live for next few days. We had like five or so inactives, Hua, our only pilot died on our first and only expedition on day two or such, and since I was trying to be helpful, most of the active people were just glad they don't have to waste APs on killing me. I even killed beta-mush Ian and helped to kill alpha-mush Finola! And on D4 started to talk from time to time.<br>By the D5 there was only five of us left - me, Eleesha, Gioele, Raluca and Paola. Rest of the crew put an end to it or starved to death. We were shooting hunters from turrets, moving ship every two cycles, doing things for morale and rushing Pilgred. We returned to Sol with just around 20 hull remaining, without any solid projects or researches done and on the brink of asphyxiation, but returned nonetheless. It was pretty intensive experience.</p>

                <p>My first ship was terrible (<a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/419)." target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/419).</a> I was Chun, most of the crew was inactive, I had not much clue where I could help and we had an awful Roland, who claimed to be knowledgable since he was a french player, but I didn't see him being reasonable at all. He accused Janice to be mush with no understandable reason and was hitting her. I wanted to protect Janice so I attacked him, but he continued to hit Janice as soon as he had ap again and killed her- she was human ...<br>I didn't like mush after that ship, but after a while I gave it another try and this time it was one of the best ships I ever had: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/581" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/581</a><br>I was Chao and I liked that character very much.<br>We had an amazing Raluca, who did Pilgred almost alone and guided us great. But we were also too less active people and the problem was to find the last mush. Jin went inactive and therefore I became even a commander who moved the daedalus to planets. In the end we had problems to get the last mush and we had no or not much active pilots. When killing the suspicious jin su I got busted arms and couldn't do anything anymore and since I was Chao I had to wait long to get aps. Raluca hacked us and returned to sol before an asteroid could kill us, but we couldn't avoid to return with one mush on board. But I had fun.</p>

                <p>My first ship I was Gioele, and though I was doing my wiki research before playing, I still didn't realize until I got there that tutorial mode put you aboard a live ship. I even ended up commander when Jin Su starved to death, so I definitely got thrown into the thick of things. Fortunately the mush were also inexperienced (dead by day 3) and there was an active gold player aboard who was willing to give advice on the finer points to me and at least one other newbie aboard. We returned to Sol on day 10 with the serum, and that was mainly because both Janice and Chun were dead.</p><p>So it was a pretty good experience, yeah. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>None of of my first four ships are really worth remembering. Well I guess my second ship is cool for running out of oxygen on <em>Day 2</em>. Apparently that one Mush who sabotaged the O2 tanks was the only active person on the entire ship.</p><p>Honestly, I was ready to give up on this game after the fourth one, but then I was selected as Mush for my fifth ship. It was terrible timing though, since I was really busy IRL. But when things calmed down, I started having a little bit of fun for the first time. Though I stayed dirty after repairing a door and got killed before I did anything interesting.</p>

I wasn't at all used to the chat system, at least not until my second ship; I barely communicated.

I had no idea what Mush was or even that everyone else was actually played by human players. I did my little tutorial, and then followed advice from all the actives. Upon mush selection our two mush were pretty lame and just mutated, killing Janice's love (and giving her corprolalia in the process) Chao and also taking out Gioele before getting killed themselves. Sadly I don't remember much except for the actives telling me "You're needed in the lab" and Janice calling us mean names on occasion (I learned quick what corprolalia does <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> ). Somehow I had become the mush queen too <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico">. But we managed to return to Sol intact, and I met some good players, which kept me with the game.</p><p>Sadly, my next few ships didn't really fare that well, but every now and then I had a few good players on my ships.</p>

I'd looked at the 16 characters, wanted to play a scientist, looked at the character selection screen, saw that Eleesha was an option, and jumped as her, remembering she was a hotshot researcher. Well, to a newbie 16 characters is an awful lot of new strangeness to try and keep track of. I still got to do a lot of research with Eleesha, as well as learn all kinds of stuff myself, so I was happy enough.</p><p>There was a huge amount of suspicion that ship. That's actually what I remember the most about it; it wasn't a murdership and <em>only mush</em> were killed by players, but oooh, there was a lot of suspicion, especially between Frieda (Comedian) and lasseruun (Hua). They each kept asking me in PMs to track the movements of various players, especially each other, and I was so newbie and scared of being tricked at first I was asking each of them about what the other had asked me to do, unsure if it was safe for me to try and do or if it could get me converted!</p><p>As time passed and I started to understand a little, I came to believe them both human because of how genuinely suspicious they seemed.... Even tried, as a newbie, to negotiate peace and acceptance between them a little, because they both seemed like they had to be human to me, they were -thinking- human and working so hard. Our Alphas were Jin and Raluca, who managed to convert Stephen, and Janice depressioned out early; morale became a major issue for us all. We turned to doing it for our salvation and made a swift return to Sol soon after D10 started, from fear we would not last much longer (I was way to newbie to understand if we were even in trouble or not). That ship even had an AP thread, so it taught me about the aftergame and the forums too.... <a href="/tid/forum#!view/112216|thread/33496882?p=1" target="_self">[AP] Sexy time</a></p><p>I was super lucky with this ship, players on it were patient, highly communicative, quite active.... I got a lot of tutoring in how to play and why do some things and why not to do others. Deeply enjoyed the experience, would wish similar on everyone <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I especially loved a lot of how Comedian had acted that ship (first aboard, made the starting threads, incredbly useful to see that as a newbie; carried it to my later ships) and I really, really learned a lot from that super-active and pretty successful first ship. Good thing too, cause ships 2-10 were mostly filled with unusually many griefers and a good share of inactives. I think the most players I've reported on a single ship so far is 5....</p>

                <p>First ship I was Raluca. She looked cool, being described as a quantum physics genius. I think the ship is full of bots, but decides it's full of real people after reading chat. I'm the kind of player who wiki-dives when I start a new game, so I knew a little. I hung out in rear corridor until Roland told me to take a back turret. I get converted when I pick up a wrench to repair a door(technician was a possible skill, figured I'm supposed to repair) and got a trap, then double-spored by Chai/Stephen in Icarus Bay since I ran out of MP from fixing the door. Stephen was a high level gold. I ask if Chao's the alpha, he says it was Paola who's inactive. We decide to PILGRED then Sol, since we have me and Chao, and we can kill Jin Su to get commander. Chao gets bored(or something) and rampages. Three people die. Stephen guards Bravo Dorm, they both die. Stephen said I should probably take anonymush, I do. I mutate in dorms and lunch Jin Su twice, missing both times. I die. A couple people died from depressuon, the rest suicided. Good mush play(two conversions with an inactive oartner/three mush kills in late game rampage.), was fun. And Kuan Ti was weird. He tried to kill Frieda without talking, but this was a few days in. I think he was active otherwise.</p>

                <p>On my first ship, I picked Andie because he looked easy, (oh, I'm a pilot, nothing too difficult.) I read the wiki and watched a little bit on the Youtubes so I understood the basic concept. My allies were really nice and informative, and it was all going fine. Until I was selected Mush. My partner was Paola and she was one of those, say nothing, wandering people, so I was left almost completely alone. I ended up getting caught sporing Gioele in the Icarus Bay, and I was assassinated. I learned a lot from that ship though.</p>

Everyone else was newbie, well except Epoq, but he was Roland and inactive so...heh. You can imagine how that ship went. We had a few betas fairly quickly, and by the time humans had realized what was up, it was time for a bloodbath. Most memorable moment is throwing a grenade in alpha dorm as Chun.
