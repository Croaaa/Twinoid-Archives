                <p>Hello,</p><p>i just screwed up my game. i was playing infiltrator mush and CHAO scared me into thinking he was onto me. i did a transfer and found out he was far from onto me. quite the opposite. i went into a pilot in hopes of taking the icarus down to the surface only to have a pilot withhout ap. i could have taken hua but i am a very male player.</p><p>So far so good in a way, i screwed up. But now i have written a dieing monologue. kinda like a villain but then for the good guys. cause the mush is good, humans just misuderstand.</p><p>I kinda confirmed there is no more mush. well, it wouldn't have been hard to be sure i gues. but i still said i was the last.</p><p>Also, i did't steal any patrollers/pasis. i have enough ap for it but they only have a single pilot now and it didn't get used alot anyway.</p><p>oh, and they can't get the serum done. no more biologists and medics left. Well they could get serum done but then i would have so much ap i could rampage them <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">.</p>

That is why you are there, that is the whole point of it all....

I agreed, then changed my mind. I realized I could demoralize Chun to death for 8 AP (she was bronze, had joined late, and people connected to Sol early) and I knew were Janice was - I intended to make spores, demoralize chun, eat spores make more spores eat spores kill Janice, then survive as long as I could, burning as much human AP as possible to try and cost humans as much as I could. I was Gioele, I'd never been alpha before, I wasn't sure what to do and killing Chun and Janice seemed deadly to me.</p><p>The Chun part of plan worked great, I demoralized her to 0 with about 5 minutes left on the cycle change, but when I got to the dorm where Janice had announced she was... Ian was there. Total change of plans, as I couldn't kill with Ian there, so.... I ran to the other dorm.</p><p>In there were Hua, who I knew was out of AP that cycle, Jin Su, who had reported about what he had done and had to be very close to no AP that cycle, and Roland, who had reported some confusion about using a turret to fight hunters, but the ship had stopped him after one shot, so I knew he was high AP. I decided that of the three, Roland was the most dangerous to me at the moment given his high AP, so I killed him.</p><p>Then I decided I'd better explain to my partner what I was doing, and started to on the mush channel, and it was only as I was typing that so he'd know what had happened and be able to use the confusion most effectively... that I scanned down the mush chat to see that Roland was my partner.</p><p>It's a mistake I'll never make again, and I feel very fortunate that if I was reported for playing against my team, it was understood that it was an inexperienced error that would never be happening again, and I never faced sanction for it.</p><p>So, Fearpls! Try to enjoy what you are doing, whatever happens, and if troubled thoughts of 'what if' bother you - remind yourself that you're doing better than Impet did her first time as alpha - and you are doing good overall. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
