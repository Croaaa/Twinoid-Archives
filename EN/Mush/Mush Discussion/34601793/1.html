                <p>This should be sanctionable. This is the third crew of mine where the conditions were more than survivable, yet I wake up and we're in Sol.</p><p>Now, it could well be that this latest was a Mush move, but in the other cases these were humans who just decided that PILGRED was finished, and there was no reason to prolong their suffering. This is not the same as Raluca insisting that she has to finish PILGRED, or the crew moping around and then voting to just throw in the towel. These are individuals â€“ in my case, all experienced players - who seem to want out.</p><p>Except other players did not agree! Some of us want to try for Eden. Some of us want to try for casting tickets. What if we aren't sure if we have Mush aboard, and want to determine that first? In this case, we prepared for several days to survive the present situation, had put pretty much everything to a vote, and were finally in the clear after days of struggling. Why would we skip to Sol?</p><p>Some players bought Gold time just to improve our chances of survival. That was not fair to them, to finally draw a good ship and then just junk it. (Gee, the upcoming MMM has nothing to do with it, right?)</p><p>I am, in a word, furious. In those ships we spent a lot of time planning out our survival, and in some cases someone who wasn't even in the command structure grabbed the Hacking Kit and made the decision for everyone. It's just as bad as griefing the entire ship, in my opinion.</p><p>I want to know if this is going to be allowed in the future. Especially before I decide to spend money on this.</p>

                <p>If it's not allowed now, then it won't be 'allowed' in the future, but the thing that will stop it is the very slow persuasion or driving away of those who will choose to end games like that. Sanctions are part of the educate or remove process, so are threads like this, so is discussion about it, on ships and off. Talk about how you want your ship to end slightly before it becomes possible for a return to sol - get players to understand why to wait, and their agreement or disagreement about the delay - make sure that everyone knows that the group wants to continue (or not!) and if the groups' wish is to continue, a quick return to sol is clearly against the will of the majority and will be reported by all # people if it happens.</p><p>Or you might find that of your 12 or so living players, 8 want to end early. Wow. Guess that's a ship that's headed back to Sol right quick, nothing to get excited about, oh well if you were part of the minority?</p><p>Sounds reasonable to me, and that's what I intend to do on my future ships. Don't assume, discuss. Teach, and listen. Seek agreement, seek consensus, and involve everyone possible to involve, even when their kinds of fun seem very different. If you try that method and fail, you can report with confidence - if you are willing to compromise, teach, and cooperate the people you have problems with are almost always very clearly griefers.</p>

Why do the two want back to Sol? I think that matters - and doesn't matter. Maybe it's because they play Mush because they want to hunt mush, and with the mush probably caught, they want to go where there's more mush.</p><p>Or maybe they are playing a new character for the first time and it bores them to tears.</p><p>Or maybe one of their friends has PMed them and said - hey buddy, I just died. Any chance we can ship together? Think you can end yours soon?</p><br><p>You know what I have to say to that? Suicide ends the game for you, and hurts other players. Going back to sol ends the game for you and if against the goals of others, hurts other players. I don't see any difference. Feel free to explain the difference to me in small words or large. I'm interested, but I'm incredulous, because -really-.</p><p>If I, to keep the right to keep playing this game and some day maybe land on a ship I want to play out, have to sit through days of the ship slowly crashing through inactivity and terrible luck, endure the fall out of griefer after griefer; inactive after inactive; Mush getting good rolls and humans getting bad ones.... If I have to sit and fight the death of this falling apart ship for -days- because it's against the rules to play against my team, to suicide and get out, to help the ship die faster....</p><br><p>Then yes, it needs to be against the rules for people who don't want one of those rather rare ships which are doing well - who don't want to be on one of those ships - yes, it needs to be against the rules for one or a few players to decide to end that ship, just like it's against the rules for -me- to decide that this shipwreck needs to go down faster so I can go play on another ship I like better.</p><p>You can explain to me why it's not the same, and I am listening, but no... it <em>is</em> the same. You pick your character, you play it out, and you do NOT play against your team. That one has wriggle room - but it means playing so that your team has the best possible chance to enjoy the game. And if that means waiting it out as a ship goes well - then bleeping wait it out, it's rare enough, and even the best ship there is isn't going to last even three weeks.</p><p>okreadytolistennowbutwowIdon'tunderstandwhat'swrongwiththisreasoning!</p>

What I have said is that there are a few situations where it could possibly be a harmful return to Sol, i.e. suicide, and that *is* sanctionable. However, the judges don't throw sanctions around willy nilly when there's no clear reason to. Which is why judges have access to the logs and the history of the ship.</p><p>Sometimes you just have to trust that people have a modicum of common sense and trust that things like this have been discussed to death among judges and there's a decent idea of what's sanctionable and what's not.

                <p>Unless there is definite proof that the Sol return had ulterior motives (ie chat log saying "I wanna go to the MMM" ), there is nothing that should be sanctioned about such an action. Sure, there may have been a chance for Eden, and maybe people didn't agree to the decision and, in the end, the situation is unfortunate for the ship's players who wanted to go on... but <em>game mechanics-wise</em> the player did not act against his team, did not help the Mush or otherwise actually disadvantage his team. It's a return to Sol without Mush on board, so it's a human goal attained, and thus a human success.</p><p>This kind of issue should be treated by the player base (express disappointment and dislike for such actions), not by moderation. I'd be very disappointed to know this is generally punishable.</p>

                <p>The issue here isn't really griefing, it's suiciding via taking one's ship back to Sol.</p><p>So report it if you think someone returned your ship to Sol as a means of suicide. "Harmful return to Sol" is the term that's been suggested by moderation team to use. Once it's reported it's in the judge's hands, they'll warn if there's proof, they won't if there isn't. And if there is proof, it's just one warning, certainly not the end of the world for that player, but hopefully next time they won't suicide in a way that takes the entire ship down with them, everyone wins.</p><p>It's really frustrating when this happens, yes, can sympathize with the OP.

                <p>It's really complicated. There's always a conflict between who wants to go to Eden and who wants to return to Sol.</p><p>I personally play for the mush hunting so I'm fine with early Sol trips. Some play for high score.</p><p>There's a middle line. The longer the ship lives, the harder it is to stay alive. There comes a stage where you need half the crew logging on every other cycle to make sure that people don't get killed by multiple sheet metals in a row.</p><p>By then, some will push for Eden because they don't want to waste their efforts and some will want to go home. After all, if you die early, you lose plenty of hard earned points.</p><p>Commander often has the final call.

                <p>Starting a ship when you know you're not going to be active enough is one thing. But feeling you may not be active enough for a D15 is completely different. It isn't intentional, as you couldn't know when you started the ship that it would go so far. And maintaining a ship after D12 or 15 is beyond a normal level of activity. It requires to be there every 2 or 3 cycles at least, even at night, and an absence of half a day can be fatal to a crew member or to the whole ship. It is understandable to be realistic and to say that you can't possibly afford to be that present, or even to say that you don't want to, because a ship like that can be quite exhausting.</p><p>And it's not that selfish, because if half the crew know that they won't be able to be present enough, the ship cannot survive very long.</p>

Suiciding is purposely getting yourself killed and thereby furthering the mush objective, opting to finish the mission is the complete opposite of this.</cite><p>It's a suicide, in the context of getting out of a game before seeing it to its natural conclusion. By that, I strictly mean, if the only reason for jumping to Sol is: "Pilgred's done", that can be seen as a "Harmful return". When there are no serious threats, or recent deaths/near deaths that have the crew saying, "We shouldn't press our luck.", then someone who decides to end the game prematurely is denying the rest of the crew the chance to see how far they could really go.</p><p>There is room for gray areas here, though. It's not simply mob rule, nor is it requiring unanimous consent. There have been times on my ships where a recent death (or a few bad expos) made people say, "Okay, we shouldn't press our luck." A return to Sol followed, but we'd previously talked about when to return, and we agreed that if we hit a point where we felt continuing was too risky, we could call it as such. And it was generally agreed that while it wasn't Eden, and it wasn't as long a voyage as we'd hoped, we still had some damn fine voyages, and some (harrowing) fun while it lasted.</p><p>The issue at here is when that conversation <em>doesn't</em> happen, and someone wants to leave the ship early. But since suicide is against the rules, they end their voyage by ending everyone else's voyage. The reason it's worthy of a sanction is because while returning to Sol that early is <em>technically</em> a Human "victory", it's also a hollow victory, with very little sense of accomplishment, aside from doing the bare minimum to secure that victory.</p>

                <p>Sanctionable sanctionable sanctionable. All I see here through the forums are complaints and talks about sanctions and warnings for whatever stupid reasons can one think of. Grow a pair god damn it and live with it. Start a new game. Having suiciders is bad but inactives are ok. Yeah right.<br>How about we sanction game code for putting 4th member of the ship crew at D1 Cycle 7!</p><p><cite>I'm utterly confused why some call this suiciding. It is a human victory where you safely get back to sol and possibly join the resistance there, where does suicide come in the picture? Suiciding is purposely getting yourself killed</cite> Indeed, this is getting to absurd level.</p>

                <p>Hey nanomed, I think you've got the wrong title.</p><p>Anyway, no one's forcing you to read any of these threads if you're not interested in them. Other people are and want to discuss it. Either to have their input heard or get clarification. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that and the thread isn't going to be shut down just because you're sick of reading about it. Here's a tip: don't open threads you don't want to read.</p>

                <p>Since there doesn't seem to be a good example in this thread where there is very obviously one person who wants to return to Sol at the expense of every other living crewmember, here is a ship that I played recently: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1664" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/1664</a></p><p>As you can see from reading the quotes, we had a very active (unusually active, but maybe I'm just unlucky) crew who were surprised by the ship returning to Sol on Day 4 with both Mush dead. For the sake of giving the benefit of the doubt to the player who hit the button to send us back to Sol (Chao), from his player history it does look like he was relatively inexperienced with that button showing up on the Command Console, and he might have hit it as soon as it popped up without knowing what it would do. If that's the case, then the game is broken to allow an entire crew to be griefed because of an accidental button-push and there needs to be a strongly worded popup warning for returning to Sol, if there isn't already - I don't remember there being one but I've only hit the button once.</p><p>Now that we've established that the ship was ended early, without the consent of the crew, by the actions of one player who did so in either selfishness or ignorance, here is the Moderator response to this event:</p><p><cite>Hi, Jerkops, you can't report after the ship is done. If this player did indeed do this without the crew's consent (looks like they did) and they are reported they will probably be sanctioned. I hope you try again, many ships aren't like this.</cite></p><p>Obviously there is a flaw in this suggestion. Just to spell it out, the complaint specifically addresses a player prematurely ending the ship. But if games that are ended can't be reported, then this is an unreportable offense. To go back to the the original post, I agree that this event should be sanctionable, but it looks like the SDF rules will have to be changed before this will happen.</p>

                <p>Okay, I stand corrected, and I apologize. I'm new to reporting and to the forums and I didn't know that there was a difference between the ship being "done" and the time when I was entering my Last Words, which was when I should have made the report. Sorry, anonymous Moderator, for taking your quote out of context! But it was an honest mistake and I still think this is an example where someone was definitely out of line for returning to Sol without the consent of the crew.</p>

Yes, it will delay your ability to enter last words and jump to a new ship, so you need to figure out which way your personal priorities lie. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

You report a chat message then click a person to report if you don't know who it is report yourself. One time I was killed and couldn't see anything because I had dropped my communication device so there are cases when you will have to report yourself because you don't know who to report.

On top of the fact it's pretty full and a lot of work, it's not going to get results fast because you would have to wait for a response and while you wait, you can't play. But, that's less of a reason than I just don't have time to take individual complaints, the judges can look at the case and as long as you clearly explain the situation it should be understandable.</p>

                <p>I should have said "it means they <strong>must</strong> have used the hacker kit to return to Sol", because there's no way to know if the commander was the one who returned to Sol (unless of course you're the commander and you know you didn't). On my ship last night we nearly used the hacker kit to escape an asteroid, and we would probably have returned to Sol soon after that. If we had tried to escape the asteroid first, someone's last action would have been accessing the command terminal, and it wouldn't have been to return to Sol, just to move the ship. So unless you were on the bridge at the time or unless there's an explicit message saying "I don't care what you want, I'm returning to Sol", you can't be certain.</p>
