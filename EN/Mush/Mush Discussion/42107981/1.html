                <p>I'm not an expert on how well ads help out F2P games, but MT isn't in a position where it would help out that much. Free games on phones can make a good amount of money on ads because it's on a phone, so people can't block ads that easily (or alternatively, the people who are casually playing the game wouldn't have the knowledge that one could do that). The lack of blocked ads plus the large amount of people trying the game equals a good ROI</p><p>Over here in desktop computer land, it seems that essentially 100% of the people who know that ads can be blocked will block them (I'm not one of them, though). MT also has an issue with not having a large-enough audience. So the end result of ads would be a negative ROI, as I can only imagine two scenarios of how adding ads would play out</p><p>First, they go the simple route, and just toss in some Google ads. This wouldn't help MT that much, since publishers can't ask for clicks, and Google heavily favors advertisers to use CPC bids, rather than the old CPM (aka impression-based) system. Unless you're willing to randomly click on interesting ads (not just any and every ad, since then your clicks might be considered invalid and end up not being counted), then MT has very little to gain from Google ads</p><p>The second (and less likely) route is to go whole hog into ads and actually try to attract sponsors. You would then end up with skinned pages and potentially some promo consumable/collectable items in the game itself. This would be a real waste of time and money, as MT would need someone on board who can wrangle deals like this (or outsource it somehow?). More money would come in this way, but there's a huge potential for failure. A company could do a test run and end up not paying for a sponsorship ever again due to not getting the results they wanted. This would then leave MT in a worse spot than before, as they would have invested time into something that can't help strengthen their long tail</p><br><p>MT's style of doing business would not gel well with an ad-focused mentality, I feel. The way they price things shows that they are not seeking a high conversion rate with their games, they just want to have a decently-sized audience that affords enough paying players to keep things sustainable. Throwing in ads would do nothing, unless they make serious investments in something that won't make their games any better</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_7657999 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7657999">1412</span></span><cite>Add it to the gold perks maybe?

Who benefits from lower prices? Everybody. Players AND developerrs.</p><p>1. How many silver and bronze players do you see on random ships? From personal experience its 70-80%. Other 20% is the paying customers. By lowering the price, you make this game worth paying for to those bronze people that think the price is too high for a browser game. For silver players it becomes more appealing too, as 4 euro for 2 slots in game comparing to the original price is whole another thing.<br>2. Gold mode availability for wider audience means... More advanced ships, more advanced mush. <br>3. Tell a friend you're paying 10 euro for a turn based time limited browser game and he will call you nuts and go to play some 3d mmo. Tell him its 4 euro and he might aswell try it out. I know I most certainly would pay for gold mode from time to time just for some difference. <br>4. Griefer / Inactives situation. More gold members means the ships will have more chance to survive after griefer attack or when you have just a half of the crew available.</p><p>5. Ofcourse I can only speculate about the income and benefit of price drop for MT, but afaik price was never lower (apart from some limited sale) and so nor we neither them can know for sure. But If you think about it logically... Why would I suffer with 1 char slot when I can throw in 4 euro and have it all. Why would I keep playing with 2 abilities as mush when I can throw 4 and cause total havoc. Imho MT had just slapped the price on the product and didn't really think about the core of the audience, which is F2Players. (Who could be their customers.) It's better for a community and lifespan of the game to have 10 people getting full experience by paying 2 bucks each, than 2 people paying 20 bucks. And even then lower price could bring more money than what they are getting now. People who buy multiple accounts just to support the game just should get Donate button and put as much money as they want.</p><p>6. Ultimately everyone will have everything unlocked, so it really is 10 euro for 2 slots, which doesnt look that appealing.</p>

                <p>Well, I don't know about other F2Players, but for me the point always was not <strong>how much</strong> I'd need to pay to get better stuff, but the fact <strong>that I had to pay</strong> to get better stuff. I played a lot of F2P games in last ten years and whenever I was thinking about whether I want to pay for the game my list of priorities was as following:<br>1. How much I enjoy the game?<br>2. Do I see myself to play and enjoy game in the farther future?<br>3. What do I get in return?<br>4. Do I have enough money reserves to not care, if they are lowered by purchase?<br>5. How much do I have to pay?<br>That last point is there just to filter out ridiculously overpriced games, where I'd had to pay monstrous sum of money to get just small and temporary effect, that I don't really need or want.<br>10 Euros as initial investment for bigger temporary boost and then permanent smaller boost is more then reasonable in my eyes. Same 10 Euros for just month of bigger boost (which becomes smellar due to being silver already) is kinda worse, but still more or less reasonable, if I compare it to, well, any other hobby I have. Every other hobby or sport I do, costs my monthly around the same or even higher amount of money. Heck, even what I pay for good dinner in restaurant with my girlfriend is more, and we are going out almost every week anyway <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>The point is, I don't think lowering the price to the half of the current one would make enough difference to raise the amount of paying players by those 100 or more percent it would need to make it profitable. Players are not customers who go through the market shelves looking for the F2P game that has cheaper gold mode then the other one. They look for the quality. Of course, some of them can't afford so much as others, but I don't think most of them would flinch from paying when they are already sure they want to pay but suddenly find out it would cost them few euros more then they thought. And those who don't pay till now - most of them won't pay regardless the cost because they are not compelled enough or don't want to feel commited to the game. Lowering price wouldn't change that.</p>

As I said before, gamers aren't dumb, and "enough" of them will try to get refunds if they don't get what they expected from paying. I saw one of MT's games get shuttered because of a single chargeback and low sales, so don't think that chargebacks are a non-issue. During the end times for a game, they can't afford cheap prices, and do you think it would look good if they raise prices just because nobody has been buying anything? Better to just have high-ish prices and do sales when they want a hit of money</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1820396 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1820396">Patches1984</span></span><cite>10 Euros as initial investment for bigger temporary boost and then permanent smaller boost is more then reasonable in my eyes.</cite><p>That made me realize something</p><p>MT could lower prices by making discounted purchases not unlock Silver mode (or require someone to buy 3 months to activate it)</p><p>There's your solution guys, I doubt you will get anything better than that</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_7857188 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7857188">nanomed</span></span><cite>Think about it from this way.
