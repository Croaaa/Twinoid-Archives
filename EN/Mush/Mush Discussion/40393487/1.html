                <p>What are you thinking about ignoring your own role for team good?

For glory farming?..</p><p>Or Janice who can work as Radio expert and laborant(especially if found <em>Medic</em> book) with her <em>IT</em>? Morale restore? Well she still got <em>Shrink</em> but in first days researching really important and morale can be restored by Andie`s <em>Confident</em>.</p><p>In one of my winning ships I found and read <em>Medic</em> book for Gioele. Then I buy klix <strong>Termos</strong> take an apron and really nice help with researching with this 24AP(5 cooffee + Ration).</p><p>Well what are you think about ignoring glory bonus for team good?</p><p>P.S. Yes, glory greeding is total lame but I see too many players who hunt on it. Like solve a cube or mass scan planet with no analize as Frieda or human`s Raluca who forse Pilgred when Deadalus still got mush-treat. So... Many players play for glory only...<br>And can you ignore this bonus if it make ship better?</p>

                <p>Regardless of Glory, people should definitely be open to swapping roles within a ship as the need arises. A lot of players will get bogged down with "how things are always done", which can limit the potential of a ship.</p><p>Deaths and Mage Books will have a pretty large effect on this. On a recent ship of mine we had Jin Su take an Astro book while Frieda became a Pilot, and on my last one we also had a full-time Piloting Frieda (via Mage book, although we abandoned Astro entirely). On that same last ship, I was a Paola with Biologist, Rebel and Medic via book so after the Day 5 base simply moved to Research (having also killed two of our three Mush).<br>Your Frieda example is a good one, especially since Astro and Pilot are both played as "save up loads of AP for one go", she can choose which to do depending on if a planet is found or there are expos/Hunters/scrap to take care of. Usually it would be a Silver Astro/Pilot one that can make the switch though; if she's Gold, Astro is going to be in there anyway.</p><p>Some characters don't need to actively play for Glory, mind: Eleesha and Kuan Ti's objectives can be completed by anyone to apply (although they usually have low yields anyway).</p>

                <p>Its easier to look at whose actually required to do something then whose free to do other stuff. The way I see it you need someone to get an O2 planet within the first 3-5 days, Paola HAS to be on coms, The Captain should generally have at least 4 ap and always give a mission out, and there should be no hunters out with at least 1 scrap collection in the first few days.</p><p>Outside of that, anyone can advance research (esp until the basic researches are done), and when O2 hits ~10 with no good planet most people should be planet scanning. If Raluca desires she could advance research and hunker down in a turret in the front, its not like she needs to spend AP on pilgred when she gets free points on it. You'll probably never see it since it's lot of movement and Raluca almost never gets a bed but its better use of AP then using one of those turrets every time her AP hits full.</p><p>There are only case where a skill REALLY goes against the play style of a character is Paola's biologist. Its not even a late game skill, It almost feels like it should be IT expert.</p>

                <p>I have some advices of new meta. I think it's sensible, but players rarely do so. I always try to follow them as human, but as Mush I try not to be suspicious and do what crew usually do because they doing something unusual is suspcious for some people, right?</p><p><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/paola.png" alt=":mush_paola_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/paola.png" alt=":mush_paola_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/paola.png" alt=":mush_paola_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>1. As Comms Manager, 1 upgrade and then Xyloph.</strong><br>Don't make 2/3 upgrades at start. 1 upgrade enough. It gives just 1 random project, it might be Plasma Shield, but it could be convienent sink as well. The 2nd upgrade needs 3 attempts to be done. You might get 3 pieces of Xyloph instead. Some of you may tell that 25% of NERON Upgrade from Xyloph goes to waste, but it's just one useless piece of Xyloph. You may carry on upgrades later, when Mush is dead. Now, you need more mage books, blueprints, Kivanc bonus, crew infection status report and Mush Disk. Maybe you'll find Chun's ghost if she's lazy and doesn't goes to Lab, maybe Mush Sample if it's lost, even Chef Mage Book would be apprecated. Lost connection? Ask crew, they should help you.<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/ian.png" alt=":mush_ian_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>2. As Ian, NEVER pick botanist. Pick biologist instead.</strong><br>Don't pick Botanist. Botanist is useless if you can take Biologist. Research is important, you may take care of bananas even if you aren't botanist. There are following reasons why Biologist is better than Botanist:<br>a) Botanist gets 2 gardening points per day, so 2-4 AP saved. As Biologist you boost research, and while doing ASG, MA and CS, you are 1,(6) times more efficient than non-biologist. If you're sleeping, with 16 AP used on research you have free more than 10 AP then, without sleeping - 5+ AP, it's more efficient anyway.<br>b) Properties of fruit? What if Andie isn't polyvalent, who can read these properties? Take Biologist, to show them properties of pills, and wait for Mage Book: Chef. Chef may read properties of fruit, and Ian as biologist takes care of pills, because if no biologists are there, no pills, but if no botanists - no fruit expect bananas and junkbumpkins, which you may get rarely. Maybe ask Hua if she can pick botanist.<br>What about fruit from expedition? Yeah, less fruit, but you it's better to have Icarus Bay secure of MycoAlarms than more spored fruit. Projects are different, but you didn't pick botanist above biologist to help with certain projects, right?<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/andie.png" alt=":mush_andie_50:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>3. Antispore Gas first? Constipaspore Serum and MycoAlarms should be above!</strong><br>Antispore Gas reduces number of spores extracted per day by 2. But who's the Mush able to create 4 spores per day? They should pass the dorm with shower and burn a lot of PA. Phagocyte? Hehe... After Constipaspore Serum done they won't have more AP from them. Fertile? Yes, Mush should reach level 11, but with Antispore Gas they'll get Mycelium Spirit also at level 11. But MycoAlarms should be done. Imagine we have 5 cameras. It's obvious to install them in Bravo Dorm and Alpha Dorm, and on the Bridge, <span class="tid_wspoil">if you aren't able to separate Paola and Frieda from the rest of crew right there, as Paola and Frieda can't get dirty, so can't infect each other, but making something like Andie's Medlab is difficult, especially when comms are needed to be connected, or Daedalus to be moved, but you may install it in the start and remove later if it isn't needed, and push these women to Front Turret, but beware trapping.</span> If Gioele gets cameras, they're installed in the Lab and Nexus. But there are some rooms missing. Icarus Bay, of course, when people goes to expo, or Fungal Kitchen perks on fruit. Engine Room and Refectory might be trapped. Fungal Kitchen perks aren't caught by camera, so it'll be needed in the Lab. Engine Room might be trapped, but the camera might be put there instead of the Lab, if Raluca stays there and she isn't Mush with Nimble Fingers, but you may check her AP using. What about 3 Bays and Rear Storages? Yeah, many rooms, and just 3-5 cameras. So MycoAlarms, altrough it isn't enough, it should be much to confuse Mush who won't trap Engine Room nor any Bays, because the MycoAlarm might be put there. Maybe human should be sneaky and put MycoAlarms in corridors where items lie? Their choice. I think these 2 pieces of research should be made at first, preferably MycoAlarms and then Contispaspore Serum.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Comms</strong> <cite>Lost connection? Ask crew, they should help you.</cite><br>It the main reason to do 2 updates first. If you are unlucky to get disconnected just after you got title and connection, it's a good chance, that you will be overflowed with ap faster, then your team reconnects. A lot of people could already used they attempts (at least active people without a lot of work who will come to you, don't expect all the pilots and Raluca to run to the bridge). Sometimes you are unlucky and reconnect only on 50%+. That's why it's better to do xeloph only on the next day after you got connection.<br>Not to mention, some projects are extremly good at the very start and much worse later - like NERON participation. Yes, it's quite a risk to get just one more useless project. But you can also get useless books, BP and empty mush status too.</p><p><strong>3. Alarms above all research</strong><br>You forget that there are much more mush tactics, not only sneaky traps, spiking and kitchen. While alarms are good against <strong>some</strong> of mush actions, they will probably just make them to use different tactics, while gas/serum (mostly gas) will cripple quite any.<br>With alarms in every room they still can do things like - green jelly cameras/alarms. Use defractor to remove such items and spore even in dorms. Mushes can have more spores (read: ap) for rampages, more ap to transfer tricks (when you accuse old body in griefing and kill it). Raluca-mush can rush PILGRED easily....really the list of action alarms is totally useless against is so long. Serum can be good, but can be useless, if you face lvl 11 mushes will free spores. While gas is useful in any situation. Maybe it's not that strong in each one, but will never be completely useless.</p>

                <p>1. Useless books? Radio Expert and Firefighter would be harmful combo, but it's rare. We might need BPs, second sofa, lizaro jungle, babel module and oscilloscope the most needed, maybe extinguisher as well. Yeah, you may upgrade NERON if you have bunch of AP instead of Xyloph, because if you have full AP and first attempt: disconnect, then you should wait even cycles for people to reconnect, but what should Paola do with her AP? Yeah, if you have up to 8AP, Xyloph would be best. You may get disconnected, but used 4 AP (2AP Xyloph and 2AP attempt to reconnect). Anyway, I think Xyloph would be best at start.<br>3. Mycelium Spirit counters ASG, I said. 1 spore less, still lots of fun. Maybe 2 agents with Mycelium Spirit. I know, if not ASG then 6 spores per day, but CS makes extracting difficult and easy work out with AP. When Green Jelly or Defacer used, we'll know and we may find the Mush amongst them, if human is at least as smart as Mush. MycoAlarms still good choice, because you may feel infected while early exploring a planet, or relaying.</p>

                <p>Those options you suggest can be better or worse from one ship to another. I depends very much on random (for comms) and mush tactics (for research).<br>Xeloph is better at the begining, if you are sure dc will not be a problem, alarms/serum can be more useful too. I would not say it's true for 100% of ships, but either of those options are quite good to use the one you prefer.<br>Problem is - you don't know before you click. While saying "useless books" is really not accurate, getting another astro, when you have 2 already, or another botanist, when you have 2, does not change much.</p>

                <p>Adding to the new meta, which will always change depending on the people onboard:<br>1) Ian can take Biologist, if Hua takes Botanist. Of course, for her to pick that, you'll need to have enough Pilots, or for Hua to be at least silver and take Pilot too.<br>This could also be affected by whether Andie is Polyvalent or not.<br>2) 25% of Xyloph DB is a lot later on when the upgrades get VERY costly, so... yes, you regret not having it later on.</p><p>Research: ASG for making sure the mush team can't have 4 spores. It's not about ONE mush taking 4 spores, but rather EACH mush getting 2 spores each. CS for eliminating the Phagocyte resource.<br>Alarms would replace in case Gioele isn't Paranoid, and even if he is, they will be placed in locations of most common sporing, but they are useful AFTER those ^ projects, which are better done first to hinder mush progress.</p>
