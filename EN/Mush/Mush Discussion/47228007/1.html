                <p>Let's discuss which qualities are most important to be good in playing as mush (or actually also be good as mush hunter). <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I don't want to talk about specific tactics <span class="tid_strike">( I am not too interested in every detail XD</span> )Tactics are always dependent on the situation. But I think what may help for every game (especially when being mush) is to know and especially realize which qualities you have and how they can be used or be improved to also improve your mush playing.<br>______________________________________________</p><p><strong>My (with your partricipation: our) list so far would be:</strong></p><p>- good knowledge of game mechanics, skills, bugs (stay informed...), every character's job, every character's strength and weakness</p><p>- good insight of the ship properties &gt;&gt;&gt;realizing which tactics might be promising<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;either good intuition or good rational decision which tactic is fitting best in your situation</p><p>- high activity (that may be only within one cycle, if you are still able to discuss and plan things with your partner at that time though the more active the better)</p><p>- good observing qualities, it may be useful to find out which people are most competent and at which times people are usually online for example</p><p>- cold blooded when mushes are in danger</p><p>- creativity for good lies or to find a solution how to execute a plan</p><p>- good (ingame) social skills to handle/understand different types of partners or crew and being able to coordinate very well with your mush partner <br>or using the social skills to mislead the crew into a wrong direction</p><p>- either thinking clear to avoid as many mistakes as possible and/or reading in forum or wiki about possible mistakes and/or learning from mistakes for the future (second option may fail sometimes since some mush strategies are situational and often can't be performed out of the book, third option would mean more time necessary until you perform well, especially since you are mush rather rarely and also learning from mistakes always needs an analysation of your mistakes and trying to find out what you should have done better-but third option means also less game spoilers when only learning by playing <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> ).</p><p>- good mush skills for more possibilities (obviously)</p><p>- ability to calculate Aps and MPs exactly when planning a move</p><p>- good ability to stay patient and better do no mushy action when it is necessary and no hesitation at times where it is really necessary to act (comment: That may be very difficult, I am as mush more a person of acting, but sometime being patient would probably have turned out better)</p><p>- (in some senses similar: ) don't worry too much. Same as some people might throw away bad feelings about something and then suffer for that, other people worry too much about, well, virtually everything. They are constantly worrying that humans are onto them, that every single move of theirs is watched and that whatever action they try to do, RNG will screw them up. Result is either acting in panic and do mistakes because of that, or not acting at all. Worries are alright in the planning phase, they make plans better, but sooner or later opportunity presents itself and you need to act. At that moment, you have to stop worry and just do what has to be done without thinking about bed feelings and "what could go wrong".</p><p>- (also in some sense similar: ) Don't be afraid to cancel plans if things go wrong beforehand, as the OP suggests patience is a virtue for mush, if something goes awry before the plan is carried out consider yourself lucky that you have a second chance later</p><p>- detailed planning and back-up plans in case of unexpected problems, especially when you are not very good in improvising or reacting fast enough in case of failure</p><p>- (in some sense follow up: ) Consider what you'd do as a human as a counter measure to your own plan and find a solution to it, then repeat the same process for that solution, this gives you effectively 3 plans of action with easily seen triggers and reactions to go with each</p><p>- rely as far as possible on circumstances you can manipulate or guarantee within a relatively decent margin of error (ie. don't trust that a player will walk through a specific area unless you break the door to most other routes)</p><p>- reflecting of your game to notice what you should improve and how to do better the next time, no matter whether you won or lost, constant will to learn something new</p><p>- a strong drive to win but not as strong that it may influence negatively your decision-making/patience/ behaviour regarding other people</p><p>- (in some sense similar: ) ability to restrain your anger even when things are not going as planned</p><p>- acknowledging good comments/ plans of your mush partners and not automatically thinking you know it always best</p><p>- ability to motivate your partners</p><p>- (maybe) trust your instincts: if you realize that your instinct was often right regarding danger occuring or where could be a problem or whether a plan may work, then take it more into account for your decision-making. Sometimes you just have a bad feeling about something for a short moment...and sometimes you better listen to it before you or someone else is convincing yourself logically that there is nothing to worry about.</p><br><br><br><p>________________________________________________</p><p>I guess noone is very great in every aspect of this list which may be extended. Also not every quality is equally important.<br>But often it is possible to compensate some weaknesses with strengths in other aspects. Different people use different methods for their decision-making.<br>It may also influence which mush playing is fitting best to you or would mean best success.<br>A person unable to stay patient very long has probably big problems to try for an infiltration win while only pretending to be human for days for example.</p><p>I did think about these qualities and came up with this list, but I guess there are many things you may add or where you would disagree. Though you disagreeing may just mean that it is no quality you need for your playing, you may propose your way then to add it.</p><p>Ps: This shoudl not turn into a bragging thread, ok?</p>

                <p>When planning:<br>-Only rely on circumstances you can manipulate or guarantee within a relatively decent margin of error (ie. don't trust that a player will walk through a specific area unless you break the door to most other routes)</p><p>-Consider what you'd do as a human as a counter measure to your own plan and find a solution to it, then repeat the same process for that solution, this gives you effectively 3 plans of action with easily seen triggers and reactions to go with each</p><p>-Don't be afraid to cancel plans if things go wrong beforehand, as the OP suggests patience is a virtue for mush, if something goes awry before the plan is carried out consider yourself lucky that you have a second chance later</p><p>And to be clichéd, prepare for the worst, hope for the best</p>

                <p>One specific thing that comes to mind, that would actually help both sides (especially a ship commander!) is to be aware of when players are active. For the mush, the reason is obvious: you can act when you think humans won't notice. For the humans, it's easier to decide whether or not to move, run an expo, etc if you think you can predict when your teammates will be online.</p>
