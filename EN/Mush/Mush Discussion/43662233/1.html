                <p>Hehe. I was Mandy's partner. It was not lack of an experienced partner; I'm not the most dangerous mush in the game but I've finished making most of my newb mistakes <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> (I made some amazing newbie mistakes in my time).</p><p>Were you recommending that I speak on the forums <em>as well</em>, and allow Mandy to reveal me there as well as on the ship? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Some new players need to hear things more than once, and from more than one person. I decided to try to maximize fun and enjoyment.... I didn't do anything actually against the rule of 'you are required to try to win', but.... I had to find my balance between 'follow the rule, and my heart, which means as mush.... do <em>anything</em> to win that doesn't break rules, and.... 'follow my urge to teach and explore with a newbie, and <em>ignore</em> that doing so means my team is more likely to lose if do'. That was a hard one for me, actually. The choice was painful. The rules tell me I may cut loose and render, and I've learned how to win as a mush fairly often with a completely inactive partner...</p><p>Nice ethics test, to have to pick between the two motivations. However, the very next ship soothed me greatly, with a fully cooperative and experienced partner who, though they arguably messed up by advancing pilgred quite a bit before mush selection (that's not sanctionable.... it does 'help' both teams, but....), so we finished it.</p><p>Note though, that 'quite a bit' was actually just 21%.</p><p>I'm not sure what resources she had left after finishing with me, but she did double progress between my resets, so we could have been more efficient. When the rush started, she only had 1 pilgred point, 4 AP, and 2 spores, and was phys/tech. I was tech, had 5 AP. We both took fertile, both mycelium, both phagocyte (so I had access to 4 spores). I saved a spore to transfer to Jin with, and saved a second spore to make from his body if needed (he could have been 0 AP, I didn't know; fertile + access to a spore meant I could get us home from his body no matter what) - I had 2 AP left in my old body when I transferred to Jin. So we had way less than full potential AP; we didn't start with high AP...</p><p>So we could have done that rush from 0% Pilgred quite easily. So, most any team could, given most of those resources. So maybe I can relax my tenseness when human about Pilgred doesn't get touched! and put that intensity somewhere else cause Pilgred at 20% or so maybe doesn't matter to help limit mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>How many ships take Pilgred to 21% or more before mush selection, and before mush are dead? I've seen many. Very many.</p><p>Was a part of why I wanted that win, that way. It's a strong lesson.</p><p>But in playing it out, I realized.... that 21% was not critical. Or even important. We totally could have rushed that with our resources, without the 21%.</p><p>And remember, part of that 21% came from Raluca. If she hadn't spent it before mush selection, she'd have had it to spend after. Probably just 1 Pilgred point difference, but still. That 21% didn't make the difference. The RNG decided that ship's outcome, when it picked the mush team. It would have been possible to stop us - only way I can think of was to see the two dots in engine room and go to Defcon 6 without needing more evidence of a problem. And/or use those two dots in engine room and start watching for the pilgred completion. It's worth throwing an AP into guard. It's hard to stop - but that's the breaks to hit.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest factors in this game has always been 'who logs on first, the humans or the mush?' Sometimes it plays out in 'unfair' ways.</p>

                <p>To initial question: I would ask my partner how experienced they are, advise them to read mushpedia and I will give them also some hints and advices (how to get spores without too much suspicion) when they are new players. When they are smart, they mostly won't be caught then and prove themselves as reliable partners and will make me excited to meet them! Even my first time as mush was a win. Why? Because I did check facts about the game in mushpedia and forum, so I was already a bit prepared and it helped me avoid lots of mistakes instantly. Of course I think at that time there were also not as much experienced player like now, so there were much more chances to avoid suspiciousness than now. I know, not all people want to study before playing ^^. Then these newbie players will learn their lesson while trying and dying, but I didn't have to pay with my life for the mistakes of my partners yet <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>To Pilgred rush: I did it one time with Aaeni on a MMM and thought even there it is almost unstoppable, especially when Raluca is finishing pilgred when Jin Su went already to bridge. So to myself I said that this tactic is only an answer if human team is incredibly limiting my fun by preventing all my possibilities to do anything mushy (that feeling I also had at that MMM, especially since I had low mush lvl). <br>On most random ships I have much more power and now my mush lvl is also a bit higher, I got lvl 11, which seems totally high enough for me right now. I doubt I will ever have to resort on a pilgred rush again.</p><p>Edit: But I think on an active ship gold mode is very much needed for a successfull mush play. I see not much possibilities as silver player anymore when other people are very experienced.</p>

Before I said that, I warned that pilgred shouldn't have been touched - that was the first post I'd made on the ship.</cite><p>I personally would not have said that until after Mush selection and I'm human. No reason to preemptively close opportunities. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As to the original question, I would give my Mush partner as much advice as I can. If I know he can be caught, then it's a question of how likely it is a human will catch him. If unlikely, I just pretend I didn't see it and continue to help as much as I can. If likely, I cut my losses and try to look human catching a Mush.</p>
