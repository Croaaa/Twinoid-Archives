                <p>Aside from giving Pilots free shots (and not all shooters are pilots by default), shooter is a somewhat lackluster skill. Overall it gives a handful of minor benefits (+1 Expo strength, 2 free shots a day, some NERON projects), but compared to a lot of similar-level skills (pilot, botanist, and even chef) the benefit of two free shots every day is somewhat weak. Doubly so once the mush hunt is over and you don't need to worry about shooting Ian or Chao.</p><p>I suggest the following addition to shooter to make it mildly better late in the game.</p><p><strong>Shooter</strong><br>-Grants 2 shooter points every day.<br>-Increases <em>turret</em> accuracy to 80%<br>-Grants +1 Expedition strength<br>-Grants a bonus to some NERON projects.</p><p>Your thougts?</p>

                <p>Perhaps just double the accuracy to 60%, in the same vein that Pilots double the Patrol ship accuracy from 40%. You don't want to make Turrets <em>too</em> good a replacement, although a decent improvement would add weight to their upgrades being voted for in the Nexus (and that Water Stick Research) instead of mostly ignored.</p><p>While sort of on the subject, possibly add the expedition strength bonus to Solid and/or Wrestler?</p>

                <p>You just should try to rampage with Old faithful + 2 lenses, with 4 extra shoots (or 6 if you do it on day change), twice instant-kills and 2-3 injuries with every shoot to see where the power of shooter skill is! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br>But I agree - for <strong>humans</strong> it is just small bonus for pilots and quite nothing for characters without piloting.</p><p>It will be more fun if Diplomat stop avoiding combats with predators, zombies and so on. So people will have reasons to contact 4 day base, take shooters to the expoes and make more weapons. Shooter will have more meaning, without any buffs (it's still much better then a lot of skills).</p>

                <p>I like the idea of making Shooter sort of "Pilot for Turrets", makes it a lot more useful on Paola and Stephen and Derek, certainly. I think it's power also lies in bypassing Pacifist and Crazy Eyes though, even if that doesn't come up too often. Turrets are still really low on charges though, so maybe a damage buff for Shooters when using turrets would help a little aswell?</p>

However many shooters don't get pilot. People such as Stephen (Unless he apprentices pilot, ofc), Derek, Paola, and Chao could do with a small buff to their ability to use their shooter points that doesn't require a magebook. Not to mention those times when you have a single 3 :hp: hunter swarming around outside and you don't want to spend 5 :pa: to kill it with a patroller.</p><p>One example would be my current ship. As Derek, I waited to take shooter until I was certain I needed it. (To stop a rampage!) We didn't get a pilot book, instead acquiring a Shrink and a second shooter book (which we gave to our pilot Terrence). Now I'm gaining two shooter points a cycle which are mostly just sitting there. It wasn't until a big wave of hunters in D8 that I even bothered to spend them, and even then I only hit one hunter from a turret!</p><p>It wouldn't be game-breaking to have shooters like Paola and Derek gain double accuracy with turrets. Of course, shooter would still be better for pilots, but at least it wouldn't feel like a waste of a skill slot! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>

Most ships have at least a level 3 Andie... or at least most ships that don't crash in three days.<br>2. <em>Panic</em>? <strong>Really nice?</strong> <strong><em>I sir, laugh at this.</em></strong> - BWAHAHAHAHA, no. The only "<strong>good</strong>" skill shooter stops Paola from getting is <em>Rebel.</em> And honestly, <em>Rebel</em> is only good for a gold Paola. Face it, Paola's primary skills are all aquired at second level. She simply does not have the AP to make use of Biologist, and Rebel is really not that great of a skill in the first place. Giving a gold Paola a slightly better chance to hit hunters from the fore turrets would not impact the game negatively in any means... except for maybe saving a pilot 2-6 PA over the course of a ship.<br>3. Derek's main task is the same as Chao's. He isn't a generalist, he's a mush hunter. <br>4. Regardless, both he and Chao are completely worthless after the hunt is over. The +1 bonus to fights is <em>negligable</em> when most ships do not fight, and those points just sit there unused, or go for a puny 30% chance to lightly injure a single hunter most times.<br>5. I suggested no such change to <em>Diplomat</em>. I just want a mild buff to turret hit chance for shooters. (and shooters only.) So they can contribute once the mush are dead.<br>6. Physicist is great as it contributes to several extremely powerful projects (Plasma Shield, Armored Corridors, and Magnetic Net! Some of the absolute top projects in the game!), in addition to repairing pilgred, giving you free points for PILGRED, and only being availible to the <strong>person who's main role is explicitly to repair PILGRED</strong>. Physicist doesn't need a buff, shooter could use more going for it.</p>

You can never hit 100% in mush. It's also nowhere near as strong as the ten-shot patrollers.

I don't disagree with buffing other weak skills.

Nurse is hardly god-awful. It could possibly use a small bonus, but considering the people that get it (chun, finola) tend to be in medlab/healing people anyway... it's really not that situational. Especially for later in a ship.<br>2. Victimizer would be a better example here. From what I understand, there is are a few devs that do indeed like it for its ability to utterly shut down a mush pre-rampage. (Intimidate is another really good skill at doing this)</p><cite>You can play Derek like that, or completely different. Depends on the crew and situation. Tracker or Torture are very good for hunt, Derek skills are not.</cite><p>Torture Chao was fairly uncommon. Very few people enjoyed playing him enough to get to that level of power, and it was possible to defeat it by keeping ones health high and doing repetitive activities after you spore. (Injecting fuel, for example, creates two entries per fuel used. I've seen loading fuel beat out a full-morale gold confidant Andie.) Personally, the one time I saw a torturer he was utterly ineffective as the mush simply kept their heads down and didn't extract until the Chao player got bored and quit.</p><p>Mush hunting has two parts. The investigation and the killing portion. Eleesha excels at the former, and Derek and Chao excel at the latter. Multiple mush rampages as well as two of my own executions on my current ship prove that shooter and wrestler are a frighteningly efficient combination for eliminating undesirable crewmembers without harming the rest of the crew.</p><p>Frankly, most Derek players are simply BAD or INACTIVE. A good one that is dedicated to his role of hunting and exterminating the mush is just as good as a pre-torture Chao (most of them).</p>

                <p>As for Kyubey: I personally dislike mush rampages. Anything that curtails it in favor of a longer, more interesting game between the human team and the mush is something that I prefer. If removing one super-easy way to kill a human ship. (I.E. killing off all the pilots when there are one or two) is one way to curtail a rampage, so be it.</p><p>The reasoning behind our difference of opinion is pretty apparent when I run a few numbers.</p><p>Jamini<br>Human Ships: 16 (85%)<br>Average Length: 9 Days</p><p>Mush Ships: 3 (2 Beta, 1 Alpha) (15%) (5% Alpha)<br>Average Length: 3 1/3 Days</p><p>Kyubey<br>Human Ships: 27 Samples (78%)<br>Average Length: 6.629 Days</p><p>Mush Ships: 8 Samples (Zero Beta) (22%)<br>Average Length: 3.875 Days</p><p>Your ships, on average, are three days shorter then mine when you play as human. You also have seen above average amounts of alpha mush play (roughly 10% above average, assuming everyone has an equal chance of alpha mush selection. Which is 12.5% per ship), while I have seen below-average chance of alpha mush selection ( 5% alpha mush selection)</p><p>This is by no means directed as an attack on you, or your style of play. It simply outlines why we may disagree on what would ultimately be a small change to the game.</p>

The only "good" skill shooter stops Paola from getting is Rebel. And honestly, Rebel is only good for a gold Paola. Face it, Paola's primary skills are all aquired at second level. She simply does not have the AP to make use of Biologist, and Rebel is really not that great of a skill in the first place. Giving a gold Paola a slightly better chance to hit hunters from the fore turrets would not impact the game negatively in any means... except for maybe saving a pilot 2-6 PA over the course of a ship.</cite><br>Why do you hate gold player so much? You play because they support to Mush-game. Surprise!<br>Researching? Without Finola it really important and Signals over in D7. Well Paola should fine place to work... and in active ship with normal Stephen,Gioele, Kuan... in D7-9 you will got no new projects so it is no sence to update version.

But he got <em>FireFighter</em>(mostly noone get this skill because think then it useless... no mushes got 16lv yet for this skill)... mostly useless but can help in Projects. He got <em>Motivator</em>(mostly useless) and <em>Strong skin</em>(particly swap <em>Crazy eye</em> it help with eating and traps but quet useless for mush-Derek).</p><p><cite>4. Regardless, both he and Chao are completely worthless after the hunt is over. The +1 bonus to fights is negligable when most ships do not fight, and those points just sit there unused, or go for a puny 30% chance to lightly injure a single hunter most times.</cite><br>It is more then <em>Panic</em>, <em>Observant</em>, <em>Physicist</em> etc skills gives.

                <p><strong>A Simple Buff To Shooter</strong>? Hm, seems the discussion isn't quite so simple. I like the idea personally of raising turret hit percentage with shooter.

Personally, I find four shooter points (2/day, and you can hold four.) plenty when a mushy Ian needs to be executed. This is especially true when a blaster can only hold three charges.<br>-Doubling Blaster accuracy would bring it up to 99%-100%. Far too much. (Rocket Launchers aren't even aimed are they?)<br>-Shooter already increases the amount of criticals, and decreases the amount of critical failures, that you perform. No reason to buff that.</p><p>Regardless, I've found modest changes are better than sweeping ones unless something is outright broken. I would really not call shooter a broken skill, just an underpowered one. A small tweak to shooter would make it less of a painful choice for non-pilots to take, and give non-pilot shooters (Derek and Chao especially, and occasionally a higher-level Stephen) a slightly better-defined role later in their ships.</p><p>Plus turrets just flat-out suck.

It's very common in game forums for misinformation to be spread by hearsay. Direct links and quotes are preferred. Even if they are in French.</p><cite><span class="tid_wspoil"> and it won't stay rare if you boost turret accuracy with shooter, well yes THIS is assumption </span></cite><p>Ships that don't have pilots, % boosted shooters or no, will probably not last much longer than current ships. For a variety of reasons.</p><p>1. Turrets only have four shots each. Moving between them is expensive. If your shooter was a dedicated turret gunner, they still would not be nearly as effective as a pilot.<br>2. Turrets would still be 20% less accurate than Patroller ships. This may be mitigated by pilot gear (Lenses, Targeting Assist, Sniper Helmet), but overall it would still be MUCH more efficient for a Pilot to simply fly out and clear the bulk of the hunters.<br>3. There are precisely two characters that would reliably benefit from this. Stephen (who may very well copy Pilot if he has apprentice) and Derek/Chao (who would be the <strong>only</strong> characters that might become dedicated turret gunners... and sort of do anyway when the mush are dead!). All of the other shooters already have Pilot, and Piloting is a lot more effecient in most if not all situations. Paola will, at most, killing one hunter a day with shooter if she has it. Her PA is too valuable to waste<br>4. Ships without pilots cannot gather scrap safely, cannot reliably land on plants, and need to deal with a 40% chance to hit in patrollers... plus they can damage the hull by trying to land. Losing your pilots is a very big, very dangerous, deal.</p><p>Considering most ships die to Asteroids, O2, or morale rather than standard hunters...I do not really see this impacting things heavily in any manner.</p>

                <p>oh, some stephen are very popular. an apprentice+creative stephen is very powerful. Derek...yeah. I played him one time and had lots of fun to play him when we found an invetebrate shell and i really was playing him mostly for killing arracks with shell and lenses/sniper helmet since we had only another pilot (who was also our commander). And it was even effective. Yeah, on most ships you don't have the luck to find a shell... ok, might be that you have on these ships a more intense mush hunt.</p>

                <p>Honestly a big problem is that Shooters <em>other</em> effect, the extra expedition strength, is something that if anything crews try to avoid. Ideally everyone wants to have Diplomat and/or the Babel Module, sometimes even making the White Flag at the cost of the soap just so fights never come up. It honestly might be worth simply rolling Shooter and Survivalist into one skill (Survivalist, Outdoorsman, Adventurer, whatever you want to call it), because right now they're both not really sitting very pretty, but it would give both Derek and Chao and the odd other member with Shooter but no Pilot a definite role on expeditions, which is something they can take part in even without having access to a lot of AP.</p>

Derek...yeah. I played him one time and had lots of fun to play him when we found an invetebrate shell and i really was playing him mostly for killing arracks with shell and lenses/sniper helmet since we had only another pilot (who was also our commander).

                <p>Socially, I expect Chun to lead, not Jin Su. Unfortunately many people seem to play Chun without wanting to do that, too. I'll listen to Jin Su if his arguments make sense, but that's true of any character. It's only Chun I give the benefit of the doubt to, and have expectations of, though, and when I'm Chun, if the ship needs moving and Jin isn't active, I'm hacking it.</p><p>Divorcing or not divorcing him from his role is sort of a difficult question since... yes he is #1, but should he be made a weaker character, or should we consider him to be potentially too strong if one of his skills (i.e. Shooter) is buffed, because he is #1 on a title track? Janice and Paola seem to suggest otherwise, both being really good characters aswell, despite starting with a title.</p><p>Chao is a difficult issue. His skills could be strong enough even with two rolled into one, but Torturer seems to be hotly discussed right now, and we don't really have access to current Chao play to evaluate.</p><p>I still think something needs to be done to the expedition part of Shooter, not just the Pew Pew parts, simply because it is diametrically opposed to Diplomat/Babel Module/White Flag, which is generally in the best interest of the crew.. making the skill at best a consolation prize if you somehow cannot provide any of those three. Something like a more significant buff (Shooter +1, Blaster +1, but Shooter holding a Blaster combine to +3?) wouldn#t solve the issue as fights are being completely <em>negated</em>, which is something in opposition to glory objectives (see Stephen) aswell.</p><p>The only things I could come up with would require rather extensive restructing however, like say.... instead of traders dropping loot when shot, you can board them using the Pasiphae or Icarus with a crew of Shooters and <strong>seize</strong> the (intact) cargo instead. This could have high chances of blueprints and materials, maybe even an artifact. Survivalist could again play a role in this and make it a more useful skill aswell.</p><p>Maybe a new project that Shooter gives efficiency on, a Mass Driver module for the turrets that lets them deflect incoming Asteroids, negating the need to move, but requires lots of AP if not performed via Shooter skills?</p>

                <p>Oh another quick thought... what if Shooter Points were converted into <strong>Aim Points</strong> instead?</p><p>Instead of serving as an AP replacer point for an action, the points instead let you use the Aim Action. For the cost of one point you "Aim" at a target, gaining 100% accuracy against that target on shooting actions for the <strong>current</strong> cycle.</p><p>This would make the 3 charges in your average blaster much more valuable to a Shooter character, would make the very low number of charges in a turret actually effective at taking out those 1-2 extra guys, and would make Pilot/Shooter combo valuable against the tougher ships, like Trax and Aracks. It would come out to about the same AP savings approximately aswell, as while you get 2 shots less, you dont need to worry about missing, which saves on crucial Charges. None of this would widen the scope of the skill, it would simply make it vastly better at performing what its meant to do.</p><p>The only tricky thing is to re-evaluate if 2 daily/max 4 would still be appropriate.</p>

Too bad all her AP has to go into Comms for the first week.<br>Jin Su isn't quite so much about AP usage, but it does involve a lot of running around between Icarus Bay and the Bridge. Although he's not got quite as much responsibility as suggested by most, I think it is still more than Porcelain thinks (although I do agree with you about Chun, too bad it's quite rare to get one like that).</p>
