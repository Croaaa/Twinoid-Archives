                <p>I see from the rules that multiple Twinoid accounts are forbidden, I searched several of the Twinoid forums and it seems to be something related to one of the other games (Dino), as multiple accounts provides you with some sort of unfair advantage.</p><p>From looking around, it seems this is actively enforced and people found to be using multiple accounts will likely have one/all of them closed.</p><p>I'm massively enjoying Mush, but the slow pace means there's an awful lot of waiting, I would love to be able to have a second (or even more) accounts to play mush at the same time, I don't at all mean on the same ship as I can see the unfair possibilities that could involve, but say two different accounts, on two unrelated ships, so I can get more mush-fix.</p><p>What is the likelyhood of Twinoid allowing multiple accounts in regards to mush? I paid to upgrade my first account to gold within a few hours of playing and if I was allowed to have a second without risk of banning I'd dish out for a second account right now.</p><p>I know there are ways around it, using VPN's and all that rubbish, but I'm really enjoying Mush and want to support it's development and success (I have been directing most of my sci-fi gamer friends too it that I can).</p><p>Mush is my first Twinoid Game, I've given them 9euros already, I'm willing to give them more, please let me!</p>

If you do make another account both will be tagged as multies and you won't be able to play at all until your second account is deleted so you'll just have to make due with one. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I hate to encourage inefficient or less fun play, but if you are at all proficient in Spanish or French, you can play those versions. If you are not able to speak the language though it's not recommended you play because translating and communicating is tedious and often frowned upon. As long as you don't speak English there though, you will most likely be accepted.</p>
