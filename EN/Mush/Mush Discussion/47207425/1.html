                <p>So over on 'Ask the SDF' I asked the question of whether Eden sleepers <em>are</em> allowed. <span class="tid_user tid_user_8095259 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8095259">Kyubey</span> posted this:</p><cite><p>Re: Mush sleepers. Can a beta mush play exactly like a human (never spore, never infect/sabotage/break anything, etc) in order to help the crew reach Eden?</p><p>You can, if using this strategy gives you reasonable chance to get to Sol/Eden undetected in any of cases you stated.</p><p>You cannot do it on ships, when this strategy will get you killed. If you get cured instead of killed, it's much worse fail btw. In these conditions trying to play as human can even earn you a report for surrendering:</p><p>- If humans are sure that there are mushes (Eleesha is active human with Tracker or logs of your convertion are visiable in modem)</p><p>- If humans suspect there are still mushes (alphas converted you using defractor in dorm duing day change, humans are not sure who exactly is beta, but think it's very likely one was made) and they have no emergecy to rush PILGRED (if humans suspect that there is a mush, but have no pilots and 30 hunters are following, maybe they'll have to rush PILGRED anyway - but it's unlikely for Eden ship)</p><p>P.s. A lot of players nowadays think, that doing nothing mushy is unbeatable, even for alpha-msuhes. They are very wrong. It's valid strategy only in some circumstance, that you/other mushes should create for you first. So it's no point to forbid it.</p></cite><p>Rather than hijack the SDF thread, I started this one to discuss whether it <em>should</em> be allowed.</p><p>I submit that it should <em>not</em> be allowed for mush to play completely human in order to infiltrate Eden. I would argue that it destroys player agency (for both sides,) and turns the end-game into a slow, frustrating, slog which is not what a game should do.</p><p>My supporting arguments:</p><p><em>1. For the mush: </em></p><p>I say this because the mush sleeper can do nothing to affect his fate. No room for skilled play, no room for social finesse. Just pure waiting for the humans the humans give up before all other humans get proven by either lame meta-gaming tests like morale-counting or food testing - or RNG-driven process of elimination (and by elimination, I mean <em>you</em>, little mushroom.)</p><p><em>2. For the humans: </em></p><p>Humans continue to needlessly display skill, not because they haven't satisfied all other win conditions, but because the final condition is completely, utterly beyond their control. No amount of sleuthing helps. You just have to resort to the legal forms of mush testing (which I hear a lot of ships do) or wait while the RNG provides the process of elimination. This could mean days of players wasting opportunities pursuing other ships where more fun is happening, simply because one player is forcing the game to drag out, and they're handcuffed to them and not allowed to suicide.</p><p>Edit: My logic only applies to random ships of course. Casting ships may agree to whatever 'artificial difficulty' rules they'd like. Randoms don't get that choice, so the ethics of right/wrong apply differently.</p>

                <p>The whole point of mush-dom is to infect as many people as possible. This is far easier on a planet full of people rather than a ship with just 16 people... 14 that aren't already mush.</p><p>A beta mush can *absolutely* play for infected return... and if that beta is Eleesha, all the better. Much like Eden is the ultimate goal for humans, infected return is the ultimate goal for mush. Accomplish as necessary. (Within the rules, of course.)</p><p>As far as the legality... I've had multiple conversations with spaz where I tried to do exactly that (play totally under the radar and try for an infected return). I didn't succeed because I was alpha, but I did have a lot of fun with mindgames. Not once did he ever say to me "hey, you know you can be sanctioned for it"... but I also did send myself a pm explicitly stating my goals and how I planned to accomplish them - just in case one of the humans decided I was playing against the mush.</p>

This thread was a discussion initiated by me to solicit opinions on what <em>should</em> be allowed based on a 'the game would be better if...' premise.</p><p>Basically, the way the game plays out for a mush sleeper Eden win sounds like it could be too grindy, with little player agency or action being helpful either way.</p><p>However, I've only pointed out the problem. Maybe I should solicit some suggested solutions for the dev team (if they read the forums.)</p><p>The game should be tweaked to make both sides still have active goals towards Eden. Maybe secret 'mush projects' in NERON's core needs to be created, both to enhance stealthy play and to make the mush have to take an active role for an Eden win. Something like reprogramming NERON crash the ship into Eden instead of landing or explode when attempting the eden jump, etc.</p><p>That sounds like it would make a mush Eden win even harder than it is, so maybe something to compensate like NERON projects that help the mush that activate once PILGRED is online.</p><p>Anyway, the idea is to make mush still be able to stealth, but make it a more active role instead of a default role. That way Eden-bound ships don't grind on unnecessarily, and mush have less of an incentive for early rampage (i.e. making stealthy play more attractive as an option.)</p><p>Just a thought.</p>

                <p>This is such a difficult victory to achieve for a mush, I have a hard time speaking against it. You have to be both <em>lucky</em> and <em>good at hiding</em> your mushiness. A lot of people stop worrying about human proofs once the "known" mush are dead. At any rate, if your alphas were skilled enough to secretly convert you after you were proven human, and then removed Eleesha's ability to detect your existence, don't they deserve the chance for you to bring it in for the team? It's certainly not an unskilled thing.</p><p>And honestly the "loss of opportunities pursuing other ships" would be happening anyway, even if the hiding beta were killed. It's called fencing with the RNG for the right to go to Eden. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> You can investigate and work on that at the same time, of course.</p><p>Now, I can see it being frustrating for all involved if all players <em>know</em> that there's an anonymush. The humans will refuse to return and the mush will feel the net drawing closed. But that's a part of the game, and would be the point where I (as mush) would come up with another plan. There's really no moral quandary about that; holding out for Eden as the mush <em>in that particular situation</em> is just not smart.</p>

                <p>You describe it as if it's an easy task to accomplish and I don't think it is. Let's imagine you are an alpha mush in a ship aiming for Eden and therefore active. You need:</p><p>1- Convert someone and take anonymush. That's one skill slot less and converting in an active ship can be difficult sometimes. And you need to do the conversion before you are a suspect.<br>2- Remove Eleesha from the ship. The list can reveal you.<br>3- Avoid expeditions completely. If you get ill in a zone event you are dead (Mush can't get ill). Hard if you are a diplomat, a pilot, a botanist, etc.<br>4- Fake your morale points. <br>5- Fake your hunger status. Remember everytime you eat and when you should be hungry. An active ship will be checking who is eating and when.<br>6- Avoid jumpkins and justify it. Mush can't get the pumpkin head and it will reveal you.<br>7- Fake any AP gain from food that the crew gives you. Hard if you are Paola, and Astro, a technician trying to rush Pilgred/projects or fixing that O2 tank that just broke and nobody has AP for it, a researcher or a pilot (counting shots remaining in a patroller after using it is a very common thing). You can use phagocyte for that but that's another skill slot.<br>8- Avoid taking too many showers. You can take splashproof but that's another skill slot.<br>And all of this while you get the trust of your crewmembers.</p><p>In my opinion, if you haven't converted anyone or rampaged before basic research (ASG, CS, Mycoalarms, Mycoscanner and Mushovore Bacteria) and before securing the weapons, mush are playing in a countdown. The more time it passes, the more confirmed humans will be aboard and the harder will be to do something to prevent them winning. I can't see why that's not a valid tactic. Specially since humans win most of the time.</p><p>PS: Same happens if you are beta mush, but just avoiding step 1.</p>

                <p>This is why I think <em>most</em> (not <em>all</em>, mind you) "meta" adds to the game. Is it truly "lame" to check for shower melt or count AP when the alternative is doing nothing and have both teams just wait around for the RNG? <br>Humans can spend time and energy counting AP while mush work out how to make their AP add up and extract at the same time. Humans can check for starvation with the medikit; forcing the mush to remember to eat in order to maintain cover. Humans can check for shower damage; forcing mush to use phagocyte, self-heal or splashproof to hide their tracks. Humans can also trick other humans into eating bad food without telling them to see if they get sick</p><p>Not all "meta" tactics are the same as some human going to eat twice under a camera somewhere. Some tactics require intelligence from both sides, and have counters which the mush can easily use if vigilant. They add complexity, which is what I ask for from this game.</p><p>I do not complain when humans use these against me as mush, because I am always prepared to counter them. In fact, I welcome it for the challenge <span class="tid_strike">because they will try and fail</span>.</p><p>When I am human, I will use them without hesitation, because it is what I would want of my humans as mush.

                <p>Wellll, I don't remember seeing a purposeful, methodical "grind" to clear all the remaining crew. That mostly happens during the hunt itself. But a decent mush hunting team will have an idea if betas are possible and if so, who. Then they'll keep an eye on them during PILGRED/starmap collection. Maybe rush the cure behind their backs if possible, and clear one at least. But often, the thing that catches the mush either comes before their plans are complete, or involves the mush laying everything out in the open.</p><p>A sloppy human team will see two dead mush and instantly relax, possibly missing a hiding beta. Or maybe they're decent and suspect the beta, but the beta plays human well enough to win their trust. Or the mush ends up in a situation where it has no excuse not to eat, and can't hide the fact that it can't gain AP that way. Or the humans stay paranoid all the way until the end of the game when they were mush-free all along. Luck and skill and social engineering. It's what the game's all about.</p>

You put 3 spores into banana. If there are any MycoAlarms, you get rid of them with excuse that there are more needed places or better - there's camera in the Lab and it's enough.

As Mush, I don't mention them if they hurt more, and following traditional makes me less suspicious, for example making ASG first if the Mush isn't going to make 4 spores per day, but most crewmembers are used to start with ASG... Why would I mention about turning off CorePeace if grenades might be use against me, but without this meta I am the only one who can use them with right... Or check each other with Medikit... as human I can catch a Mush, as Mush I can only attract suspicion which I don't need, I can just accuse people that they use Medikits as I don't want to them to focus on me, remember that no suspects amongst human means dead Mush.</p><p>About AP, gaining them in way human don't see is hard and that's why human is right if counts them. Winning logistics in room with crowd... to gain about 2 more per day? You may at least cover AP which you're supposed to gain while eating. Maybe you get lucky while repairing stuff or extinguishing with few AP but you can't pretend that you overused AP all the time. You may steal items giving you passive or private active benefits like Scooter, Wrench, Medikit but where and how to be undetected? Defacer might be, but it uses some AP to clear logs and human will focus on people being in the defaced room. You may borrow your partners AP and pretend you relay more when your partner is more skilled and he'll cover you. It works if your partner is known to avoid the dorm with shower. It might work very well while gardening, it takes much AP which may cover Ian or Finola stuck in the Lab/Medlab. The most efficient are missions. Free 3AP per day and commander uses 1AP. You may stack them. Show that you can make 6 relays and get dirty while "eating", making spores meanwhile and prove you're clean in the same cycle, when your limit is just 12AP. The last possible way to gain AP is simply using Phagocyte if research on CS is delayed. Connect it with Fertile... and waste 2 Mush slots for AP gain. Don't forget that you have to get access to shower.</p><p><cite>* Using anonymush to hide after a partner and a beta dies. Instead of acting human, convince humans they are mush-free and convert a few more Betas in the meantime<br></cite><br>It happened 2 times when I managed to convince them they're Mush free enough to repair PILGRED and converted one Beta meanwhile. First time I returned to Sol as soon as PILGRED was repaired. Second time I tried to convert the most, but crew didn't hold the ship and we were forced to return. And the third time was when I was able to convert the whole crew while they were thinking they were Mush free just when Beta was killed when half of active crew had already been converted and it was the best voyage I ever had, although I left one human in Sol on purpose. But I think it'd be the best if I managed to convert crew on their vision, that they know the Mush, but they can't kill any of them. It's possible when Ian, wrestler and solid people are converted and weapon owned.</p>

                <p>That's a bit offtopic, Kyubey, isn't it?<br>But I can understand that people have different opinions of how they want to play as mush. I guess many people like to sneakily convert betamushes, isn't that a great achievement?<br>On some ships the chance is just very low because the crew is either too active or the mush level is still too low.<br>Many high-level skills do exist just for that purpose-to make infections easier even when research is strong.<br>But I think every person should probably observe the situation very carefully to not underestimate the humans. Often especially low level mushes have to decide for other and not conversion-related tactics than high level mushes to have a chance to win .<br>edit: before Patryk is showing up: yeah, of course there are some skills and tactics which may be effective to convert people even with low mush level ^^</p>

                <p>I am all for this technique. I have used it as an Alpha mush, once I had converted someone and taken anonymous. Even better if the converted person is inactive. When they don't die of starvation, they become a prime suspect and get killed.</p><p>I've mostly done it for a Sol return but it would be valid for an Eden ship as well.</p><p>Another time, I was in an overly ambitious plot to convert anyone but Chun to mush (taking anonymous as we went), finish pilgred, kill Chun and return to Sol with a mush-only crew. Sadly the ship was destroyed when we only have about 4 people left to convert. While it may sound very different from the original post, our plan involved converting people in a discreet way, which means that most people who had already been converted were expected to do their human jobs instead (especially the pilots to preserve the ship), and only a couple mush were in charge of infecting others. So most of the mush did play as humans during the ship, and those who hadn't been converted didn't realise so many of us were mush.</p><p>I think it's a valid strategy. As stated in the SDF message, not when you don't have anonymous and less than 2 mush have been killed: humans will know there is at least one mush left so you're not actually hiding successfully. Same with Eleesha printing the list: one more mush will then need to die. If that means the mush team agrees to sacrifice some of their team for the greater success of the mush by only having on of them stay alive and infiltrate the humans, so be it.</p><p>I always consider return to Sol or Eden to be the actual mush goal, with destruction of a crew as a plan B if return is impossible.</p>
