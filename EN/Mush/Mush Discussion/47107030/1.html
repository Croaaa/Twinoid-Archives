                <p>Yeah.</p><p>I have some questions people probably can answer a whole lot better than my extremely quiet shipmates, and it's a pretty depressing game. I feel completely lost and useless. Like many new players who try to be active, I huddle under the camera waiting to die until someone tells me what to do. I'd like to actually take part in the game, tho. Right now I don't feel like I'm having much fun.</p><p>...</p><p>One. How exactly does the Mush Transfer ability work? How can you counter it? On my last two ships, Mushies did this, both times to kill Janice. The first time, our Chun identified the saboteur and all was fine. The second time, somebody shot a human who I guess had been...something something. I sort of instigated it, so double shame for me. I'm also unclear on if transfers can happen under cameras.</p><p>Two. Can Cameras be broken on our purpose, while they are installed? Like, with no one knowing? I saw a camera break on our bridge, and wondered if it was accident or intended. Of course, I don't know who actually sees the camera logs. Maybe they lied.</p><p>Three. So, are you pretty much doomed if you have no pilots? In my last game, we had two AFK pilots, and only one active. I'm not sure what we could have done...</p><p>Four. What if you has a useless/afk/mush captain? It seems to me you are TOTALLY screwed then. Your ship won't be able to move or collect resources. Or if they are mush, they can just AFK or screw around, and you lose. Like, how do you recover from that? Goes back to number one. What if they transfer your captain?</p>

                <p>Hey there.</p><p>1. <a href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Transfer" target="_blank">http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Transfer</a> <br>Mush should infect his target once and then he could transfer with him/her. It shouldn't be the same mush, who infects the target though - his partner could do that, or even cristalite zone trap in the expo, I guess. The fact is that you need your target to have 1 spore, then you can transfer. You and your target would switch the bodies and you will have no skills after that (so you should reset it, both human and mush). Transfer, and well, any mushy activity can happen under cameras, but it could be revealed by it.</p><p>2. Yep, cameras can be broken on purpose - <a href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Green_Jelly" target="_blank">http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Green_Jelly</a> <br>Although you have to wait a bit, till it would be broken and someone can notice that.</p><p>3. Well, depends on the ship, but mostly yes. At least for a long journey. You can try to rush killing your mushies and repair (or trade..) PILGRED. People can do piloting, even if they are not Pilots, if NERON administrator turn off the piloting lock, but it's pretty dangerous (both for ship and so-called pilots). But it's possible. Also, you could be lucky and have a Pilot mage book.</p><p>4. Kill him? Commander, NERON administrator and Comms officer are not a skill, that's a title. <a href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Titles" target="_blank">http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Titles</a></p>

It does activate MycoAlarm though. The best way to see if transfer took place is to see if anyone's skills got resetted. There's no way to prevent transfer but you could kill all inactives so mushes won't be able to transfer into characters with full AP and MP bars. You should also try to keep you AP low if you play as Raluca, Chao or Derek.</p><p>With very active captain you can sustain several days just by moving ship.</p>

                <p>Come under my wings, Fio_ I will teach you! Just kidding <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Nice that you are asking, that's great and yes, here are many people to help you out. But often also on your ship are experienced players <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Most questions are already answered, I want to elaborate them a bit if I think something has to be added so they may help you more to regain some spirit for the game.</p><p>To your second question:<br>As also already answered in the Q&amp;A thread, Green jelly (a mush skill) can't break cameras without leaving a log, but it is possible by sabotaging the camera while being alone there. Also a camera may break randomly, but if a camera breaks randomly, there is a NERON announcement mentioning the camera breakage. If there is no announcement, you can be sure that it was due to a mush UNLESS a fire was in the room and broke it or an electrical spiking did break the equipment (but such a breakage due to fire is also visible in the room logs then).</p><p>Three and Four: Without pilots (and given you are mush-free) there is really no hope in exception of rushing pilgred and return to sol before the hunters are destroying you.<br>Moving the ship away by the usage of 1 fuel and by the commander from many hunters is helping (as long as it is possible and no aracks are preventing it). Without trail minimizer you will loose half of your hunters, but sometimes moving may also trigger new hunters, just flee again then ^^.<br>A combination of one commander and one pilot is often able to take care for a long time of hunter waves when the commander is always moving as long the ship until only around 5 hunters are remaining and the pilot is destroying these 5 hunters.<br>If there is no pilot or invertebrate shell (that artefact is helping to deal with hunters by using of turrets and can be found very rarely on expeditions with chance for artefacts) then the commander has to flee from hunters almost the whole time then and he may be able to give you enough time to finish pilgred, at least he shoudl be able to do it, when there is one person who has technician or physicist.. It is best if you are finding a time where the technician/physicist is online and another person with many aps too. Then these 2 people can relay each other and pilgred is done very quickly, it is really working fine! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <br>If the technician/physicist on the other side is working alone on pilgred, then occasionally a person is coming down to ER, posting "relayed" and several cycles later the technician/physicist is noticing the relay to work one time again at it, then.... pilgred may take ages to finish <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">.<br>But these advices are only counting if you took care of mushes of course ^^. With mushes on board you shouldn't finish pilgred and return to sol, they would win otherwise.</p><p>The commander won't be able to be active the whole day or may be inactive, but you may use the hacker kit to hack yourself into the command terminal and move the ship by yourself!</p><p>Another hint: Since hacking is using up many aps unless you are lucky, just stay logged into the command terminal as soon as you are successfull and don't leave the window of the terminal as long as you need to move.<br>So someone without command title may stay logged into the system for several cycles and can take the role of the commander and flee from hunters or move to planets and leave orbit after the expedition. Woohoo, problems solved peacefully! If the commander is really inactive and not helpful then it is better to kill him though so the next person in line may get the commander title.</p>

                <p>Re: <strong>useless captains</strong>, this is the (main) purpose of the <strong>Hacker Kit</strong>. It allows you to break into the Command Terminal and move the ship even if you aren't the Captain. The major downside is that it's quite an AP hog - it's not unknown to blow your whole AP bar without breaking in. It may also end up hidden by someone on your crew, to keep it out of mush hands. (Or, perhaps because the mush got there and hid it first!)</p><p><strong>Green Jelly</strong> is not as widely used as it used to be, because it was pretty badly nerfed. You used to be able to use it on a camera in a crowded dorm with no one the wiser, but now cameras will spot its use, making it... well, pointless.</p><p>The only thing that I have to add about <strong>Transfer</strong> is that it isn't <em>quite</em> free because it requires the target to have a spore on them first. That means that the mush either had to set up their target in advance, or they may have to spike them right there first, often under a under camera. And to repeat WeakestLink: <em>both involved players lose all their skills when a transfer happens.</em> A Mush will often rechoose theirs if they'll be useful to their plan (Chao's Wrestler/Shooter/Crazy Eyes, for example), and if the human is online they'll usually start shouting about being a transfer victim. Otherwise, they'll stay silent and their skills will remain blank. Mush may try some more tricks regarding this though, so be wary!</p><p>It seems like we've been having an inactivity spike lately, but I've seen these come and go before. Hopefully you'll have the luck of a decent ship soon. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>EDIT: ninja'd a couple times while I was goofing around. Heh.</p>

                <p>How to counter transfer? Well...<br><em>Joke: tell to Chun a code in case you got transfered so you may call it every time Chun asks... but seriously, who would do this?</em></p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">You should remember that the victim of being transferred might be everybody who may carry a spore, so each person on this ship beside Chun, even, or <strong>especially</strong>, confirmed human who has got an illness/disorter, double-eaten, Natamy test, etc.<br><br>How to make sure you don't be targetted with transfer?<br>1. Be Chun... <em>or Frieda with Antique Perfume skill and wash every 3 cycles.</em><br>2. Be in place where nobody can get you, so stay outside in Patrol Ship or Pasiphae.<br>3. Have all the Mush killed.<br>4. Be Mush.<br><br>When you cannot get to <strong>point 1.</strong> ...<br>The <strong>point 2.</strong> is very situational and I don't recommend you to follow this unless you realize that the Mush is going to transfer into you, for example you're in active rampage... or PILGRED repaired discretely and you're commander.<br>The main goal is to reach the <strong>point 3.</strong><br>Even don't think about the <strong>point 4.</strong> as human.<br><br>Think there are 16 crewmembers and at most 13 of them might be transfer target. When they don't know the Mush they won't run away catching a Patrol Ship and staying outside.<br>Basically, you <strong>can't</strong> stop transferring, the Mush has open way to each of crewmates, they just pick one per each Mush.<br></span><br>Let's return to main question: <strong>How to counter transfer?</strong><br>When you can't stop the Mush transferring, give them <strong>as few advantages as you can.</strong><br>So the answer is: <strong>don't trust your body.</strong><br><em>Remember that the answer excludes Chun herself.</em><br>What should you do to follow the answer?</p><p>1. Don't hold Blasters or any shooting weapon if <strong>your character has Shooter skill!</strong> You don't have to pick Shooter skill to let the Mush pick it. Hide the weapon somewhere to use in the further but remember that <strong>your body</strong> will see the hidden object.<br>2. Don't hold Knife or Grenade, nor Hacker Kit while expedition. Follow point 1.<br>3. As commander don't guard Front Corridor to prevent from accessing Command Terminal. If someone else guard, make sure you don't have access to Commander Terminal in the time the Mush may make much harm if had access to them, you may even get rid of AP/MP while exploring planet.<br>4. Don't leave the most important private conversations open, these ones with some information the Mush can use to harm the ship (for example about weapon location).<br>5. As Chao/Derek, don't stay at full AP, remember that you may eat a ration to gain same while big actions, but the Mush won't.<br>6. As comms manager, shoot traders giving PILGRED offers if 2 Mush are alive.</p><p>And more, more... just follow the answer and the advices I've given.</p>
