                <p>In this game I want to be a Mush. Its the name of the game, the main reason the humans have for excitement and part of the paranoia and intrigue.. <br>And yet with even 2 out of 16 people every ship becoming Mush, technically a 1 in 8 chance, Ive only been an Alpha Mush a handful of times in the plenty of ships Ive been aboard.<br>Most of the time the players who become Mush just go Inactive after finding out their predicament, lamenting over having to play the "bad guys" that is this game fundamentally revolves around. And so most of the time its either a crapshoot with Humans winning by default against inactive Mush, or Mush winning be default from AFK humans. Not what this game is meant to be.<br>Its an honor, a speciality to join their side and its what makes the game fun.<br>And still the few times I am lucky enough to start as Alpha Mush I usually make some stupid mistake that dooms me, now having to wait another 20 ships before I am Mush again.<br>This is why I won't pay for Gold mode.<br>Let me choose a higher odds of becoming Alpha Mush, its part of the frickin game!</p>

                <p>Get on castings, you won't have to deal with AFKs anymore. Plus there's an option for 3 alpha mush. Yeah it's not perfect but it's still increasing your chances of 1) being mush and 2) not having to deal with AFKs, which sound like your two big issues here.</p>

                <p>Frankly told, I'd pay even more often for gold-time if there was a possibility to choose the ships / sessions manually similar to <em>Die2Nite</em>; you would still have the max amount of (4) launched ship before launching new ones of course to avoid "empty-ship" (at the moment, the automated-filling-system is simply broken for the most part...).<br>Heck, if it was due my decision, there would be only a single ship at the time being launched and only when the ship is full, then a new one would be launched. But that's something that would require generally a revamp (already complained about this at the bug-list-thread).</p><br><p>Regarding to "<em>winning</em>", I believe that is the biggest "ruining element" in this game, the mentality of "I / we must win", that is: Far too many times I've been - correction - every single ship / session I've been in was ruined by a "meta-optimizing"-player(s). It's not against rules, sure, but only the "meta-player "wins"" in these scenarios.<br>In fact, it's almost as if these players are on purpose trying to prevent (non-paying) players to participate on Casting-ships (read: reaching at least <em>Day 10</em>), considering the swiftness behind these optimized "ruinations", especially on ships that pretty much puts all the chances against human-players (e.g. ship has been launched and has reached <em>Day 2</em> before the first player has even joined...).</p><br><p>Back to the Gold-subscription-topic: Yes, even I do demand for bit more benefits. Unlimited casting-memberships is one of these. Generally better quality sessions would be the other (granted, this mainly a player-issue, but still a priority would be important(heck, for the most part this could be solved by removing the Glory / Triumph-system, but that's kind of extreme...).</p><p>Umm...yeah, I don't have anything else add for now...</p>

It's not against rules, sure, but only the "meta-player "wins"" in these scenarios.<br>In fact, it's almost as if these players are on purpose trying to prevent (non-paying) players to participate on Casting-ships (read: reaching at least <em>Day 10</em>), considering the swiftness behind these optimized "ruinations", especially on ships that pretty much puts all the chances against human-players (e.g. ship has been launched and has reached <em>Day 2</em> before the first player has even joined...).<br></cite></p><p>What do you mean exactly with your statement?<br>Why should it be bad if people like to win the game? Plz explain it.<br>Do you think it is better if every person is playing for themselves alone and doing what they want on the ship no caring whether it will help the ship or not?<br>I actually like rather the opposite, when each time each team tries to do their best to win.<br>As mush I would like to have a challenge with humans and as human I would like to have a challenge against mushes.<br>And actually the people who like to win are mostly responsible whether a ship is able to reach day 10. Also I see on lots of ships that there are not much people who help with the most important tasks-for example we are all pretty low on morale, we also have a shrink mage book, but there is noone who is going to read that book , but instead some are solving the kube.<br>Or do you only mean actions like doing mush tests as "meta-optimizing"? Then I would agree with you.</p>

Just join another ship and don't give too much thoughts about it just because you had bad luck in your few last ships.<br>Not everything is perfect in this game, but it doesn't mean that you have always a bad experiences.<br>Maybe you joined after a game always the next ship and got the same people by coincidence, hm?<br>And if people did hold onto weapons before mush selection, just report them. The judges will give them probably a sdf point and if they don't change their behaviour they will be quarantined at one point. You shouldn't do it either! An advice from me: Look where the weapons are before mush selection, right after mush selection hide them and tell Chun about their loactions so you make yourself not suspicious. Then you can prevent often early rampages. <br>Try to be a great player, there are already much of them out there, you will eventually meet some of them on your next ship <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>As Sperbi says, if you see rules broken, or believe you are seeing rules broken, please report it. Every ship, every player that breaks rules, please.</p><p>If you do not report a rulebreaker, there's every chance that player will go on to break the same rules (and maybe others too) on future ships, without end.</p><p>If you do report a rulebreaker, that rulebreaking behavior is very likely to end one way or another (some people didn't realize they were breaking rules, others knew but choose to stop breaking them when they are sanctioned, others choose to continue to break them, continue to be reported for it, and are stopped by the system).</p><p>If your ship has many rulebreakers on it, report them all. If your ship has 4 rulebreakers, I honestly don't mind if all twelve lawful players report all four of the rule breakers. Sure, that's 48 reports for just one ship, but if each one is a legitimate report, rules really were broken.... lets get it fixed. The system can handle that happening, and it won't result in an unfair increase of punishment.</p><p>To clarify, in case it is unclear:</p><p>It is <em>not</em> allowed by the rules to hold most items before mush selection.</p><p>It is <em>not</em> allowed by the rules to force human testing on random others, or to kill people 'just because they refused to prove they were human'. Note that if there's other evidence a player is mush and a human test is offered, then the player is killed - that may well be a legal kill as long as that other evidence is reasonable. The key parts of this are 'random' and 'just because'.</p><p>It's also <em>not</em> allowed by the rules to just be a complete jerk on your ships and play in a way that really makes the ship a totally miserable experience for others, be that through badgering and putting down the game as a whole, the players as a group, or even just badgering one specific player a great deal, especially without reason. Any judgment calls on such things are determined by judges, but the coded-in name for that rulebreaking is 'spoiling', 'passive negativity', or 'active negativity', depending on exactly what is happening and how severe each judge interprets the behavior to be, and yes, ruining ships through a bad attitude is rulebreaking.</p><p>So if someone is ruining a ship you are on, report them. It won't save that ship, granted, but it does help improve the future.</p><p>If someone is ruining a ship you are on, you can also, openly or through PM with select others, discuss the problem and come to some consensus about what to do about it as a ship.</p><p>On one of my early ships, long before I became a mod, we faced a griefer who hacked and moved the ship pre-mush selection, killing a pilot out in space, and then using some rather pointed hostile phrases intended to be generally offensive and directly violating the language rules of T&amp;C. In addition to reporting them, I responded by creating a PM with every other player alive aboard and explaining that mush or human, I wanted the whole ship to band together to remove this player from it, and that I personally would not stop until that offending character was dead or mine was. That I happened to be low AP at that moment, but that I was going to do nothing else on that ship but act to remove that person until they were gone, and I hoped everyone else agreed and would do the same.</p><p>They did; that player was dead within the cycle. Rather surprising, as most of the ship were quite new players or inactives; the mush were active and the ship died an early death with a mush win. Problem solved regardless, for that ship. The griefer was dealt with.</p><p>If you have a ship with someone trying to force human testing on everyone, or a small group trying to do this to everyone, talk about it, openly or privately, in addition to reporting them if you feel they are breaking rules. Maybe you can get your whole ship to understand and agree that widespread human testing is not a way they want to play (note that it is legal for any individual, or even -all- individuals, to human test, if they choose to. Ship fill is random, and it's possible to for someone to be mush on a ship where all 14 humans are eager to prove they are human. There's coded impediments to make this.... problematic for the humans, but sure, it's legal to try if every individual involved wants to).</p><p>If 3-4 people on a ship are trying to forcibly test or kill everyone else aboard the ship, and the other 12-13 organize and do not agree to participate or 'allow' anyone to be forced.... That ship could still end with a human or a mush win and I bet you no one is getting forced if people choose to resist.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">One of the neatest things about this game, I think, is that it throws you, over and over again into a situation with 15 strangers and some serious problems. No one is coming to help, even if the situation is utterly unfair and harder than it was ever meant to be. You 16 solve the problems or be destroyed by them. You have a huge role in determining how events play out. You can <em>allow</em> others to control you and the outcome of events. You can <em>cooperate with evil intentions</em> or <em>believe you are helpless</em>, but you actually are anything but - you have the exact same power as anyone else on that ship, give or take a few random events. You by yourself have only so much power, but there is <strong>nothing</strong> to stop you from team building, negotiating, organizing, and forming a group to handle the problems that you face, be they coded in or socially created.<br><br><strong>This game is all about the power that you, personally, have, and how you can use this power to achieve your goals, through coded and social means</strong><br><br><em>You are not helpless here. You do not have to obey anyone.</em> You do have to work towards a win for your team, and the judges need to be able to understand how what you do works towards that win without breaking other rules (in case you are reported), but you can be part of the answer to any problem your ship faces, be it coded or social. Almost every problem on these ships needs teamwork to resolve. If your ship has a need, figure out how to meet it, or be defeated by it. Remember you are part of a team, and it is sensible to attempt to involve the resources and strengths of the team to resolve all of these problems.</span></p><p>And report rulebreakers, please.</p><p>Good luck and hope to play beside every one of you, as time passes!</p>

                <p>Not necessarily so. It's possible the mush spiked you one or twice before dying, and left room traps or fungalled food; you could become a 'ghost beta', converted on a ship that had been for a time mush-free. Sure it means at one time you had active partner(s), but now you probably don't know where any other roomtraps are, where fungaled food is, where things were hidden, who else has any spores (until you are able to click on them yourself).</p>

                <p>I think my original point was that in this game the people who become Alpha Mush go inactive from spite because they are the "bad guys" and they dont want to play them, while those who throw money at this game to buy Gold Mode (several times) dont seem to ever get Mush.</p><p>Those of us playing for a chance at Mushiness never seem to get it despite showing our devotion to this game via money, no extra odds or the option to choose being a Mush. Us Mush enthusiasts would gladly play a Mush anytime and add that passion to the game necessary for a fun ship round.</p><p>And its not even about the money, Ive played on dozens of ships and only have become Alpha Mush a handful of times ( I can count it on one hand) and becoming Beta Mush is next to impossible since people meta-game the crap out of this game. 2 out of 16 players = 1 in 8 odds = 1 in 8 Ships becoming Alpha Mush, but totally not the odds Ive experienced. Too many new players becoming Mush with no sense on how to fullfill the role, often dying in the first couple of days from "newbie" mistakes because the tutorial is crap when it comes to being Mush.</p><p>No standing in corridors, no eating food made by others, no suspicious activity of any sort, totally stacked odds against the Mush with little to no hope of conversion by the conventional means implied by the game mechanics. You basically have to rely on incompetent human players to make mistakes in order to have any chance of spreading infection, usually resulting in the frustrated Mush player just going on a rampage, a total cop-out on the potential gameplay.</p><p>And ofcourse its against the rules to try and become a Beta Mush, topped up with an ever suspicious crew who will kill you without warning if they suspect you are trying or have become infected.</p><p>This game could be so Mush better ....<img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mushxp.png" alt=":mush_mushxp_50:" class="tid_ico"></p>

Everything I learn as either role helps both roles.</p><p>There's so many ways to win as mush or human. Personally, I enjoy letting the humans tell me how they want to lose. They do that by failing to protect one or more of the many avenues by which they can be destroyed.</p><p>When they protect every avenue.... then we see who can wait the other out - or if I really don't think my chances over time are better than my chances right now; I am freely allowed to rampage at any moment.</p><p>As human, I get to learn a ton about mushplay, by trying to catch it and stop it.</p><p>It's OK to wish that the game was different from what it is, but that's no reason not to value it for what it is. This is a really awesome game! That we can play both sides, and must, increases the variety, depth, and skill of all players. Having <em>used</em> defacer, I now know how it works. As a human, it won't confuse me very much when a mush uses it. Having struggled to balance AP against spore and spike costs, shower access, and the rest.... I know what it looks like when a mush is doing that.</p><p>Knowing what I wanted as mush, tells me what I'd better defend against as human - and how. What matters and what doesn't.</p><p>I sympathize with your frustration. Every ship is different.</p><p>The people who are currently mush deserve our very best game as humans, for them to play against. That probably doesn't mean instantly human testing to prove ourselves. There's times when I, as human, eat raw food, even food someone else brought. Times I stand where there is no camera. And I'm not playing to lose as human. I'm taking what I believe to be very smart risks based on exactly what happens in the specific ship I have, compared to what that ship and my team needs.</p><p>I hear your frustration. I simply answer it with an invitation - don't call for the game you think you want... who knows where or if you'll ever find it? Embrace the game you have, and delight in it. This game is deep, and intricate, and subtle, and greatly varied. No two of my ships have ever been greatly alike. I've been playing for most of a year.... and I still learn things, sometimes many things, every game.</p>
