Do not hold items or work on anti-mush research. (<em><strong>Note:</strong></em> As of July 2016, this once again includes MycoScan. It is forbidden to start this research before mush selection, regardless of starting spore status.)<br>~ Mush tests may not be forced upon other players. <br>~ The only acceptable language on this server is English. Your posts must be understandable.<br>~ A harmful return to Sol (without crew consensus or while the ship is still early in its voyage, for instance) is not permitted. This includes pre-selection returns that amount to “giving up” on the voyage.<br>~ Do not encourage others to break these rules.</p><p>On being cured:<br>~ A cured mush is allowed to play “amnesia” and remember <strong>nothing</strong> from time spent as mush.<br>~ A cured mush must cooperate with their new human team.<br>~ Amnesia alone is <strong>not</strong> an acceptable reason to kill someone.</p><p>Given the high number of complaints, we ask you all to think before using the report button. The complaint system should not be used as a means of pressure on another player. This type of attitude may lead to a sanction for abusing the report system.</p><br><p><span class="tid_mod">How do I report someone for breaking the rules?</span></p><p>To send a report, simply click the report button on any message on the wall or at the top of any PM tab. Ideally, this should be related to the report, but it is not mandatory. Select the player that you are reporting and enter a reason.</p><p>When selecting a player, please do not select someone at random if you don’t know who broke the rules. We can only take actions against the specific person reported so if you report the wrong person, your report will be useless.</p><p>Your reason should be brief, but should explain the situation. Do not simply write “griefer”, but tell us what the player is doing to grief the ship. Do not repeat the message that you clicked report on, but instead tell us why you felt the need to report that message. This is one time where it’s allowed, and even encouraged, to treat us like we’re stupid. Tell us exactly what you think we need to know.</p><br><p><span class="tid_announce">Additional information about the SDF</span></p><p><span class="tid_mod"><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"> General Information</span></p><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/talk.gif" alt=":mush_talk:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>What happens after I file my complaint?</strong><br>Complaints are sent to the SDF Complaint system, and are handled by judges and moderators, comprised of the players in Mush.</p><br><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>How are complaints handled? </strong><br>The complaints are generally treated once the game is over. Judges have access to the logs in the history and can assess the situation. It is necessary that three judges vote on each report, except in cases where the first two judges decide the exact same sanction is warranted.</p><br><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/mastered.png" alt=":mush_mastered:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>What happens in case of a guilty verdict? </strong><br>A notification will be sent by the SDF briefly explaining why you were punished. Depending on the severity of your actions, a number of SDF points will be attached to your account. When you have accumulated too many SDF points, you will be quarantined.</p><p>Points do not come off of your record (except in cases of successful appeal) and quarantines will increase in length as points continue to accumulate on your account.</p><br><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Quarantined? </strong><br>If you gain a certain amount of points, you will be quarantined immediately and will be unable to join a new ship until your quarantine period has expired.</p><br><p><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/talkie.png" alt=":mush_talky:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Explanation of your penalty</strong>: <br>If you do not understand your punishment or you feel that you are being punished unfairly, you can appeal to a moderator via <a href="http://twinoid.com/tid/groupDiscuss" target="_blank">http://twinoid.com/tid/groupDiscuss</a> and messaging "EN Mush Mods". Our logs do expire, so make sure that you appeal or request more information within 3 days of receiving your sanction.</p><p>Keep in mind that moderators do continue to have full access to the logs of your ship. For the best response, be respectful in your request and do not twist the details of situation.</p><br><p><span class="tid_mod">Additional Notes</span></p><p>Although Mush is a social game, we're not here to solve your <strong>personal</strong> conflicts in the ship with other players. We are not here to play the role of your mother. Do not report someone for using the occasional obscenity, especially in cases of high frustration. If it rises to the level of personal attacks or affects the entire ship negatively, then you can report the player.</p><p>And of course the <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/help?cat=general&amp;scat=rule">internal rules</a> apply and the <a target="_blank" href="http://support.twinoid.com/cgu">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p><p>To discuss these rules or if you believe we've overseen something please feel free to ask for clarification in the “Ask the SDF” thread in the <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/tid/forum#!view/112222">Advice Forum</a>. The threads fill up and new ones are created, but the most recent one will always be “stickied” at the top of the forum.</p><p>In multi-player games like Mush some might pressure you to show them a screenshot of your game page to "prove" your innocence or situation. Using screenshots in this way is not prohibited by the rules, but the roleplay (RP) element is immediately lost when using screenshots so it is considered not within the spirit of the game and is discouraged.</p><p>Warning: to threaten or kill of any player because they won't provide a screenshot, will be deemed "negative play" and the perpetrator will be punished!</p><p><span class="tid_mod"><strong>Public Moderator List</strong><br><br>SDF Moderator <span class="tid_user tid_user_516 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="516">Peanutz</span><br>SDF Moderator <span class="tid_user tid_user_1721761 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1721761">spacekadt</span> <br><br>For SDF penalty explanations/appeals please navigate to <a href="http://twinoid.com/tid/groupDiscuss" target="_blank">http://twinoid.com/tid/groupDiscuss</a> and PM "Mush Moderators" due to the limited time logs are kept, we ask you to PM <strong>within 72 hours</strong> of the SDF penalty assigned or we may not be able to investigate it.<br><br>You may also PM the method described above for general questions related to SDF.<br><br><img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> The SDF Team <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/mush_triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph2:" class="tid_ico"><br></span></p>
