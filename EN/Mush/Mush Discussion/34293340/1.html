                <p>I am not sure if this is the most appropriate subforum to put this in, it may be more suited to the lounge. But that forum is mostly for afterparty threads anyway, so I will assume this is appropriate. I think moderators can move it if they deem its current placement inappropriate.</p><p>First thing's first. I received a warning. It's content:</p><p>"You have been sent this message as you have been reported".</p><p>Okay. That makes sense.</p><p>"Griefing, abasement of others and deliberate spoiling of the game experience are not tolerated. We remind you of the T+Cs. As well as the rules of Mush."</p><p>The implication here is that I have broke either the T+Cs or the rules of Mush. Well, let us look at those channels. The T+Cs are rather long, you can look at them in their entirety here:</p><p><a href="http://support.twinoid.com/cgu" target="_blank">http://support.twinoid.com/cgu</a></p><p>I went through them to check if I had broken them. I have not. Furthermore, a relevant part of them is the first half of Article 4:</p><p>"Motion Twin can decide to close the account of one or several users without previous warning or justification. However, the closure of an account will only be used as a sanction which is the result of an abusive use of its service. Some examples of this are as follows: cheating, thefts of accounts, the opening of multiple accounts, fraudulent payment and the lack of respect for the current rules and general conditions."</p><p>An abusive use of its service. Abusive? I do not remember being abusive. And as for the examples, I have never done any of those. So, in other words, Motion Twin, according to their own Terms and Conditions, has no right to ban me until they can prove that I have used their services, to use their own words, abusively.</p><p>Okay, so I have proven I have not broken the Terms and Conditions. The other channel the warning message discussed was the mush rules. Let us take a look at those, then. (Incidentally, Motion Twin, the link in the warning messages goes to the mush help home page - you might want to consider making it link directly to the rules.)</p><p>These are shorter, so I will post them in their entirety.</p><p>Abusive provocation could be sanctioned.<br>Not respecting netiquette could be sanctioned.<br>Denouncing your Mush teammates could be heavily sanctioned.<br>Playing against your team could be sanctioned, surrender is not permitted.<br>Any data entered in Mush are not private, may be seen by players you don't know and may be modified by a third party. never share private information in the game. Motion-Twin cannot be held responsible for any information you share in the game being made available externally.</p><p>(Also a linking error, the SDF thing goes to a french page.)</p><p>The first thing is somewhat more interesting. "Abusive provocation". What does the word "provocation" mean? I looked it up on Dictionary.com and got three meanings.</p><p>1. the act of provoking.<br>2. something that incites, instigates, angers, or irritates.<br>3. Criminal Law. words or conduct leading to killing in hot passion and without deliberation.</p><p>Well, the third is clearly absurd. My actions could never have led to a reasonable person killing someone in real life. That's just stupid. "Something that incites, instigates, angers or irritates". Well, I admit I may have done that - but the interfering adjective here is "abusive". I have never done any of those things in a way that a reasonable person could consider "abusive". The first definition - the act of provoking. That's not very helpful, lets get a definition of "provoking", shall we?</p><p>"To anger, enrage, exasperate or vex".</p><p>So it's the same as the second definition, got it. So that's rule one clear and not broken. Moving on.</p><p>"Not respecting netiquette could be sanctioned."</p><p>Well, that's a very strange rule indeed. We need a definition of netiquette, clearly.</p><p>"The rules of etiquette that apply when communicating over computer networks, especially the Internet."</p><p>Not helping, Dictionary.com. Honestly, I think Motion Twin should be the ones obligated to provide a formal definition here. "Netiquette"? You've got to be kidding me. Please explain exactly what etiquette you want.</p><p>"Denouncing your Mush teammates could be heavily sanctioned."</p><p>Haven't done that, next.</p><p>"Playing against your team could be sanctioned, surrender is not permitted."</p><p>Haven't done that.</p><p>"Any data entered in Mush are not private, may be seen by players you don't know and may be modified by a third party. never share private information in the game. Motion-Twin cannot be held responsible for any information you share in the game being made available externally."</p><p>That's not even a rule, it's a disclaimer. I'm not going to ask what it's doing on that page.</p><p>So, there we go. We've gone through the several thousand word long Terms &amp; Conditions as well as the Mush rules, and we can see I have broken none of them. We can also see that Motion Twin has no right to ban me unless they can prove I have been using their services abusively, and we have seen I have not. So, Motion Twin? The ball falls into your proverbial court. What justifies this warning?</p><p>You may be wondering why I would possibly put this ridiculously long rant on the forum rather than submit it to Motion Twin themselves. It is simple: Because I want you to see the absurdity of their reporting system - and for that matter, know that at any time, you could be warned by Motion Twin without them providing any justification. Frankly, I suspect that hundreds before me already have been unfairly warned. I am simply the first one to speak out. And perhaps, when Motion Twin reads this, they will realise that I have been unfairly warned and take it back. But will that change what has happened to the others?</p><p>No.</p><p>So, Motion Twin? Will you change this system and ensure the innocent are found innocent?</p>

It was warning #609, on ship #1619. In other words, 609 out of 1619 ships have had a warning - over a third. I've been on at least twenty ships, and at the very most two of those have had rule breakers - and two is a stretch. While that doesn't prove there are a large number of unjustified warnings, it strongly implies it. Unless there's a magical forcefield keeping me from being on the same ship as rule breakers.</p>

                <p>The ship number is the same as the "The End" screen that was linked to, which I indeed played on, so if the ship number is generated numerically, it is logical to assume the warning number is generated numerically. Unless an SDF moderator tells me it isn't, I think it's reasonable to assume this is the six hundred and ninth warning.</p><p>For that matter, frankly, one incorrect warning is too many.

I've been on at least twenty ships, and at the very most two of those have had rule breakers - and two is a stretch.
