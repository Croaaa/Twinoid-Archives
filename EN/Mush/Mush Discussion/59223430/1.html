                <p>This is a continuation of the derailing from the SDF Thread, I just thought it better to move it here:</p><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_9466449 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="9466449">FallenBard</span></span><cite><p>I'll derail a thread just a little bit more clarifying what i meant to say. <span class="tid_wspoil">Sorry about that i'm going in length here. I had to create a different thread for that <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico">.</span><br>I was talking about well, pve way of destroying the ship not pvp. And actually you don't actually need to destroy everything i listed, just a few things. I was corrected a few times, there actually some mechanic in place to remedy this, but not fully.<br>1.) Food - one mush with 2 spores<span class="tid_wspoil"> (he can get 4 i guess and have ap to get into pashie)</span> can cook around 24 rations with microwave if i count right. That makes all food stocks after selection probably so the humans will have around 2 days after this to get to Sol or starve hard especially if you hide\take the bananas and all. That will force humans to try and find the second mush and repair pilg in 2 days or less, or they will lose. It's pretty hard. <span class="tid_wspoil">(especitally hard if food destruction wouldn't be noticed immedtiately)</span><br><span class="tid_wspoil"> (you must be neron admin or Janice should just be a bit slow for it to work)</span><br>2.) Fuel - you can exaust 18 fuel in 2 cycles if you are a commander <span class="tid_wspoil">(or harder with hacker)</span>. It won't cost much ap and can be done fast. If there is noone who can stop you in 2 cycles and 2 fuel was already spent. The tank is empty and they can't even leave you and you are perfectly safe (<span class="tid_wspoil">well almost there is oxy trick that won't work if you have oxy capsule yourself and maybe hunters too, also trader can come... and you'll shoot it from patrol)</span> in the pashie\patrol after that.<br>3.) Oxy - if you are safe in the pashie (see 2.) you can break oxy tanks each day for fun and nothing can stop you. Also if you manage to break tanks few times after day 1 and grab some capsules most of the time it will be enough to kill ill organized ship. Especially if they forced to jump to leave\magnet you and not astroscan.<br>4.) Hacker - If you managed to hide well\give to a teammate\lose hacker kit and you are commander, there is nothing the crew can do to you in the pashipae, and you can terrorise them all you want, with oxy tanks destroying as easiest strategy.</p><p>Well something like this. It's more like guidlenes for mush <span class="tid_wspoil">that are not meant to be in this thread</span> but still my opinion that doing one of this things greatly improves mush chances in most cases. Because you are using one of you members as a resourse to keep whole crew busy, while second mush get all the chances it wants, even if the crew somehow manage to survive the above. It can get absurd if there x3 mushes, and even worse with sleeping mush i guess.<br>And what I wanted to say is if anything of the above goes "meta", the fun will be ruined hard for everyone. Well i'm new here, but already seen enough examples of how mush in the pashie can ruin a game by itself, but if he actually knows what he is doing and prepared for it from the start, then for most random ships it's a game over.<br>Most of the mashes tend to avoid the partoller trick even if they know about it, so i guessed, maybe there is some unspoken rule about it except the "partyruiner" kind of rule.</p><span class="tid_wspoil">Excuse me for my blathering I have nothing better to do.</span></cite><p>I too have nothing better <span class="tid_strike">I want</span> to do so here we are!</p><p>1,) If you were to cook 24 rations and have them be destroyed you'd have to use your entire AP bar to do it and it would need to be in cycle 8 at daychange, a time when humans are on HIGH alert, and you'd almost certainly known the Sol signal offline which gives an announcement so someone would come look very quickly, and since you'd have no AP you're history.</p><p>As you say though, that's not a problem, so if you had destroyed the entire stock, and even blown the next coffee (Coffee resets satisfaction as well) then the crew would have 3 days to find more food before they started losing 1 HP per cycle, a rate that can be outhealed. Uncomfortable, yes. Annoying, yes. Deadly? No.</p><p>The humans may decide to repair PILGRED however as this gives coffee every cycle so this single handedly defeats starvation and they can simply guard the <em>front corridor</em> and no one would be able to abuse PILGRED to return home.</p><br><p>2,) You could exhaust the fuel, that's true, but this in itself does absolutely zero to stop the humans winning, and there are various methods of regaining fuel outside of expeditions, and if you were to take a patrol ship to hide in so as to destroy any traders, they could then use the <em>pasiphae</em> to salvage fuel from the wreckage of hunters... However!</p><br><p>3,) Oxygen is still by far the most realistic of the victory conditions you're aiming for so you could time your fuel exhaustion with critical oxygen levels thus dooming the ship, but you can't come and go as you please from space, the humans can simply have 1 person guard the bay you used to escape in and then you are trapped, never being able to leave the bay without killing the guard. Who would usually be *Chun* or *Ian*, armoured, and unconvertable/difficult to kill.</p><p>As for stopping them scanning, everyone can scan, not just <em>astro</em>'s so that's really down to RNG (which does have a habit of being a bitch however!)</p><br><p>4,) This is again defeated by simply guarding whichever bay you're in</p><p>---<br><br>Any of the tactics you mention, if done correctly would pose an obstacle to a poorly organised ship, there's no doubt about that but there are very very few uncounterable situations, they exist but the time it takes to set them up can get you found out in the first place if you're not careful.<br><br>This is why we love Mush though, nothing is predictable! (Despite the walls of players that will cry about predictable Mushes rampaging this, stealing that, blah blah blah.)<br> <br>Having a good / crafty Mush on the ship the very essence of the game and what makes it so unique and awesome!</p>

                <p>Thanks for relocating us. I feel much better now.</p><p>1.)<br><cite>Then the crew would have 3 days to find more food before they started losing 1 HP per cycle</cite><br>I though it would be 33 hours if they are all just ate something? And with -14 hp per cycle on the ship is a minimum of 5 AP per cycle from best medic if everything is perfect, and that's can't be true. They will hardly last 2.5 days more at best. Coffee and bananas are great but still.</p><p>If they repair pilgred that's another deal, but then it can be used by the second\third mush - profit again.</p><p>Also noone will kill you, because lifting off is just a 2ap and some mp away if you are any pilot. So it's not a big deal. You get 1 more ap\mp on cycle change anyway.</p><p>2.) <cite>they could then use the pasiphae to salvage fuel from the wreckage of hunters... However!</cite><br>They can't if you are the pashipae, and fuel traders are actually a rare deal. Anyway they will have a reeeeeeeeaaaally hard day or few to try and get you. Just what you want.</p><p>3.) <cite>you could time your fuel exhaustion with critical oxygen levels</cite><br>The problem is that oxy supplies are overrated. Let's count.<br>You are breaking 2 oxy tanks on cycle change. <br>That's -3<br>You are taking -3 more capsules with you.<br>Next cycle noone will supposedly fix them if you timed it right -3<br>If you counted right the number of oxy will go from 3 to 0, so someone will die on this same cycle counting as one more 1 oxy.<br>If you friend or two join in and go to space with capsules, it will be 3-6 oxy accordingly, or more if they will be breaking both oxy on cycle changes right after they will be fixed <span class="tid_wspoil">(if there 3 mushes it will be -4 more oxygen lost)</span></p><p>So, humans can lose 7-16<span class="tid_wspoil">(up to 20-28 if you are breaking oxygen tanks one after another and they are left for 1 cycle not repaired)</span> oxygen at once if both tanks will be repaired within 6 hours., the grenade can be build, and the oxy tank can be broken again on next cycle change by another mush. You can actually kill off most of the crew like this, even starting from day 1.</p><p><cite>The humans can simply have 1 person guard the bay you used to escape in and then you are trapped, never being able to leave the bay without killing the guard.</cite><br>Well that's true, i forgot about guard mechanic, but still if you bring any weapon with you on the ship. the guard is pretty much doomed, and if it's not Chun that would be a ridiculous paranoia spike, not to mention that you can still use transfer after all this. You can even transfer to guard itself as soon as he gets there and rampage some more with fresh ap probably.</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">As for stopping them scanning, everyone can scan, not just astro's</span><br>I've meant that when you exaust fuel you'll drop any planets that where found before, and fuel from hunters wouldn't be enough to reach any oxy planet probably.</p><p>Anyway the thing is, if mushes won't rampage around, they have almost no chances of surviving. Because in a good crew noone will get dirty, and they will be tested eventually. If 1 mush will rampage the way I state above, the human crew will have time limit of 1-3 days. And it's not enough to find a silent mush. If they can make at least one beta mush in the meantime. That's it. Only RNGesus can help human's survive somehow.</p><p>But if the human crew is no good, missing some roles or can't trust each other perfectly. Then one mush can destroy them with almost full certainty, without even using one of his skills. Even spores. And that's when it gets awkward. Because as I said before mush fighting the ship in that case. Not humans. He can drop his talkie right at the begining, and he won't lose anything, <span class="tid_wspoil">except the delicios tears, ofc, which he can collect after the game end.</span></p>

                <p>1.) Well yeap, you are totally right. The plan to destroy food is good and all actually, but the starvation mechanic is a total lacklaster, and provides less danger then actual ap reduction from no food, duh.</p><p>About hiding though, as i said you need to prepare measures to ensure that they can't just push the button.</p><p>2.) <cite>)and there's 1 or 2 traders that can offer fuel (crewmember =&gt; fuel and a few others if you have a diplomate on board) </cite><br>Well, if you can chose either pashi to not allow fuel scavenging, or patrol ship, to shot the traders at once. So either way it would be a problem to gather enough fuel to get rid of you. Especially if you are not guard blocked, or friendly mush can asist you against traders.</p><p>3.) <cite>not sure how you count it, but braking oxy tank will require most of your AP</cite><br>That's totally not true, because you need only 4 ap to break a tank on average with saboteur, so you can break both tanks just fine and get out, not to mention spores and +1 ap on cycle change.<br>You even will have few ap points to hack\change crew lock and get away even if you are not a pilot. It's another reason why hacker kit must be safe.</p><p>4.) <cite>you can't have weapons you steal oxygen</cite><br>Well if there is no fuel, there is no big need to steal oxygen you can have a weapon or anything, also you can grab only 2 capsules if needed.<br>But the main problem is ofc that you need to convince someone to stay in one room with desperate mush potentially armed and with spores. Ian is nice, but still.</p><p>I mentioned before, that if the human crew is good enough to get you in pashipae without the fuel, with broken oxy tank and can get the second hiding mush in less then few days, then the stealthy attempts are screwed from the start anyway.<br>A good half of random ships are falling apart by themselves, so be honest and try to guess how many random ships will make it, if on let's say, day 2 captain\the guy with hacker kit will break the oxy tanks and burn the fuel using the phagocite, without even trying to spike someone?</p>

Anyway with a little bit of luck you can break one or both oxy tanks and make an escape even without it. (eating the spores will give you at least 8 ap, so with full ap you'll have 20+1 on cycle change. That's just enough to do everything you need without saboteur as lvl 1 bronze mush)<br>The tactic still remain "broken and cheap", because it can be repeated 2-3 times in a row, according to the number of mushes. And that's enough to depleate oxygen most of the time. Even if they kill the second mush on spot, the'll have around 5-6 cycles to finish pilgred at best dying from oxy.<br>But oxy drain tactic is basic and everyone knows it. The thing is that most mushes underestimate it.</p><p>I was mostly talking about pashipae hiding.<br>All it takes is 2-3 uses of hacker kit\commander, and 2 fuel loadings.<br>Then if you are draining fuel\hiding hacker kit and commander humans will need all the luck they can have to get fuel from traders before oxy shortage to survive, or kill the second mush by randomly stabbing each other and finish pilgred.<br>That can be done almost on day one if you get your hands on HK, and can continue for a long time, all the human crew can do is wait for trader's losing oxygen. But well, anyway the tactic is nobrain and can be used even by nonmush griefer. But still it's not unbeatable.</p>

                <p>I've returned to game only recently after two-years absence. Still there weren't a single ship in my experience (from at least semi-active once) where exist even one "uncovered" cycles. So all O2-removal strategies are mostly ways to direct the blame on a specific person, since after initial checkout no one ever have a reason to visit Central Storages, except when fixing stuff. So yes, let suppose you somehow got both tanks broken and no one get your blips on a map (call me paranoid, but I usually monitor daychange thoroughly). That will be a -3 O2 per cycle. Let also assume you manage to steal up to 9 O2. Fixing a tank is a 3-4 :pa: for technician, less with wrench. For non-tech chances are smaller, but we get a food, a mission and other sort of :pa:-boosts. I've seen quite a few "planet-scan" rushes in that condition, and quite often it's possible to locate an O2 planet, even if risky one. Also, IIRC, next cycle you get only one death, even if it's -3 O2 per turn, and the ship is on the planet, working with it and jumping away, and your comrade who went out with ship is suddenly dead. Now, let us remember that there is also plants that keep O2 income, and it's hard to damage them without a few specific skills like Pyromaniac or something like that. On D1 - it is still +2 O2 at the end of the day, and removing of O2 is, IIRC counted _before_ adding from plants. So you got 1 dead crewmember if you somehow make it down to zero, but two more O2 in tanks, and a whole cycle to fix it back, find a planet, and go back to step 1.</p>

                <p>IIRC express cook (cooking in the microwave) is actually a free action, and a lot of mush <em>do</em> cook up a ton of rations to waste food but I've never seen a ship die of food shortage. Fruit + coffee are more than enough so you also have to take out the plants. If you are a chef or the microwave is repaired, and if you have spare MP to fit the ref into your plan, sure, might as well toss that into your rampage. But who repairs the microwave before comms are done? Are you going to repair it? Mostly it's Mush Stephens that waste rations because they can use the chef points. But if you fail to turn food destruction off this can expose your stealthed partners more easily because other people will eat those rations and some of them are going to get sick.</p><p>Also want to chime in on the "your 2am isn't my 2am" thing. Your plan takes place cycle 8, but cycle 8 is 2 <strong>PM</strong> where I live. Some ships it's really clear most players are in Europe because I get that night-shift feeling where nobody is online with me, other ships end up seeming more NA based and the only way to know your shipmates' active times is to wait and see. It doesn't even need to be a tech that comes online either, just any human with AP. If a mush broke both oxy tanks and flew away with oxy, even Finola can put on the apron and start fixing tanks. Every character becomes a generalist character in an emergency. For all 14 humans to be either offline or out of AP is a big stroke of luck.</p><p>Bay guarding like that is a real strategy. If you have pheromodem or mycoalarms researched it's fairly safe even if the guard isn't Chun or Ian. If you land you better have enough AP to kill or convert in one go, and then take off again, and you better hope your guard is offline because he has just as much AP saved up as you do, and he can eat. While you are saving up all that AP humans are churning through NERON projects to get the magnet and pull you in for your execution, unless you are lucky enough that they passed up on the magnet early.</p><p>I would not want to count on being able to successfully hack with only a few AP. I've wasted a full bar of AP on unsuccessfully trying to hack before. I've also done that and watched sadly as a few more crewmates blew their whole AP bar trying to hack. I think that ship exploded... :p</p><p>Lack of fuel stagnates a ship but won't directly kill you. Hunters will show up, scrap gets pulled in, more fuel is found. If both mush are exposed and killed you don't even need to find more fuel if you don't want to, because jumping to Sol doesn't require fuel.</p><p>Not sure what measures you can prepare to prevent the ship from being moved while you're in space, basically you need to either completely zero out the fuel, make sure all capsules are empty and go in the Pasi... or you need to be the commander and secure HK. But most Eleeshas can search as a free action and you can't take the HK with you. How did you get the HK to start with, though? Chun hid it immediately after selection, or she's holding it, or someone else is holding it to pass to her when she comes online. Maybe if you're lucky it's sitting in the lab for her to pick up. But as soon as you take it the rampage has to start because people aren't going to take kindly to you holding it, so now you have to fit the lab into your AP/MP spend of the rampage too.</p><p>And having an active, cooperative partner on a random ship is pretty lucky. Since I think you mean random ships, there's always 2 alphas there, so to do this a third time you are also planning to somehow secretly convert a third mush without either the alphas or the new beta getting caught (because they all need to be stealthed until they do their round of oxy theft). Where in the plan does that happen?</p><p>This plan isn't a bad plan (it's a variant on a pretty common rampage strategy) but I don't think it is as foolproof as you're suggesting. If you and your partners all expose themselves like this early, that means all the effort that would have been dumped into the mush hunt can now be dumped into countering you, if there's even anything that needs to be countered, because there are a lot of places in this plan where things could go really sideways. It's really complicated and actually harder/more work than some of the more foolproof ideas.</p><p>Try it next time you are selected and do an AP thread for the ship. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> I think 9/10 times it won't get any further than you not having an active or cooperative partner. They'll be inactive, or be anti-rampage, or they'll have their own awesome plan and either be already dead after exposing themselves or want to infiltrate/get NERON death.</p>

                <p>Also I don't think you would be allowed to repeat this plan on any decent ship. You pull it off once somehow maybe, and then settings are going to get fixed, bays are going to get guarded, and the hacker kit is definitely going to get held. Maybe if your partners are pilots/NERON admin. But if you have Janice and a pilot as your partners I think you'll have no shortage of fun things to do even without this specific plan.</p><p>Also also, what if you're Eleesha? She can't fly off until her vertigo is cured, so now you have to be lucky enough to get a bed with Janice and <a target="_blank" href="http://mushpedia.com/wiki/Shrink">hope you don't get revealed that way</a>.</p><p>Not trying to be a downer, just having fun thinking about this plan. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Well the 8 cycle requirement is actually valid only on food destruction.

                <p>It's impossible to "make" bananas dry, and anyone can care of them. And even thirsty bananas provide O2 on daychange, even if you hold them, even if you hide them. You can try to hide them, but the dedicated search is find them almost immediately even without Eleesha. <br>Speaking from experience, any sudden depleting of resources, be it hull, be it O2, be it fuel will be noted. Some people (and not a small part of community) count even :pa: of others, so the obvious resources will be checked obviously. Killing fuel is impossible in less then four jumps, and that's half of the day and will be noted. Killing starting O2 is nearly impossible - with 9 stolen (if you somehow also convert a third mush, and still have an :pa: to do all of that) and -3 per cycle, with medium of 20 units of O2 you will be found earlier. Yes, O2 and fuel removal can be viable, but only if you have a lot of other conditions, and usually there are more easy way to rampage from classical "make two grenades, blow, blow, transfer..." to something more precise like leaving ship pilot-less etc.</p>

And some of them work in given circumstances, others don't.

Same as only sometimes works to go on killing rampage or play a stealthy conversion game or even try to go for Eden infiltration. It's not a question of "what's easy to do and hard to counter" but of "how easy it is to weight the situation and find the best way how to win in it." And this is different from ship to ship - sometimes the weaknesses of given crew are evident and it's mushes job to abuse this. Other times, it's not so easy and you need to work creatively or be ready to jump on the slightest opportunity. And that's the whole point of playing as a mush. Banning certain tactics would just put a unnecessary limits for those who are looking for the way to victory on their particular ship.</p><p>Of course, there are some more or less hard rules like "cooperate with your partner" or "don't out yourself needlessly" but those are there to maintain the basic concepts of the game (secrecy, communication, etc.), not limit the mushes in their way of gameplay.</p>

Just visiting both central storages and then moving back to the engine room three times - remember, you can carry only three fuel capsules at a time - is 14 MPs, i.e. you need convert at least 1 AP. If you're starting in alpha dorm, bravo dorm is even little bit more expansive. And this leaves you in engine room, while you need to get to Jin Su or whoever is just being Commander. Say he's in dorms and you have to convert second AP. That's 11 APs already and you need that last one for transfer so Jin Su already had to be spiked. Or you has to use one mush skill slot for Phagocyte (together with Saboteur and Transfer, so you need to be golden) AND be able to create spores beforehand to have them on you AND not be suspicious enough so you don't end up killed before you're able to get 12 APs. That's a lot of "ifs", actually.<br>But, yeah those are just details, don't want to nitpick. The thing is those are details you have to work out while actually being on the ship, otherwise, you might end up in the situation, where you misscounted your actions and your whole plan gets busted before you were actually able to do any real harm.)</p>

                <p>I've miscalculated with starting fuel, you are right. But even one jump without explaining is a witch hunt signal, that's point A. <br>Point B. Let assume that we start with full gauges (even MP) in Alpha dorm. Move to CAS = 2 MP. Move to CBS = 4 MP. Move to any Rear Storage = 3 MP. That left you with only 3 MP even if you start with full gauge. Now, to load nine fuel units you should spent 5 more MP, and that's 1 AP and whole MP gauge. Extract spore, run to the bridge, spore and transfer - impossible to do it alone. And each of this actions, starting from getting twice entry (X enters Alpha/Bravo bay) is suspicious, easily checked and blamed party will be quickly put to the ground.</p>

                <p>Cycle 1 is 6pm, I'm still awake. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> Although I think you're right that it's a relatively quiet time.</p><p>Infect the cap/transfer into the cap only works the one time, unless the second person is waiting until captain mush is dead (and title to be transferred) to do their rampage. But this would mean human team has a lot of time to deal with the first rampage. By the time the second mush has a new cap to transfer into, the human team has already organized and gotten everything they need to deal with this particular threat. They have the mag net, they've figured out how they want to guard the bays, the HK is secured, the tanks are repaired and people are keeping a close eye on who's passing into the central storages.</p><p>I mean if you are already at the point of having 3 smart, active, cooperative stealth mushes with full AP, on a random ship that is pretty close to having already won. But I think it'd be more effective to look at the ship's weak points and your team's strong points and work with those instead of trying to come up with a master plan that you apply to every ship. If techs are a weak point on the ship, why don't two of you just rampage at once? One person can break a lot of stuff with green jelly and hack BIOS, a second can break the tanks, then those 2 transfer into techs and then fly off with the plants. If one of you is high enough level Raluca, wait until the mag net comes up in the Nexus to do your rampage, and have her genius something else after you transfer into her. One of you goes out in the Pasi to prevent scrap hauling, another in patrollers and use AP to hit traders. The third mush stays stealthed with anonymush. I think this version requires less luck and not any more coordination and is more likely to succeed. They have no way to recover Pasi, no way to recover plants, no techs. They will have to rush to return home and if they do somehow manage to repair Pilgred you might still be able to infiltrate. Or the third mush can rampage too if he wants, break more stuff, take the wrench, and body snatch a third tech if you have to.</p><p>Still not a foolproof plan though! Humans might finish the mag net before you can coordinate your rampage, or it might come in a NERON update, in which case you can forget flying off with the plants. People might get suspicious of one of your teammates before you all have AP to rampage together, forcing them to act before it's ideal or ending up getting murdered before they can do anything.</p><p>I think I know what you mean by the "PVE win" though, there are strategies like that and people do get lucky, like here: <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/10919" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/10919</a> Mushies gonna mush, I thought this was really funny actually. Selection starts, Paola and Frieda are both active and online, and there's a Pilgred trade open. So Frieda walks into a storage, Paola trades her, transfers into cmdr and jumps home. It was pretty great. Sadly I was not one of the mush. The only thing the humans could have done to prevent this was to shoot down all the traders before selection, which I think is an easy oversight to make because using the turrets isn't really anyone's job except maybe high-level Paola, and if you're Paola why would you shoot down the traders before selection. So I usually don't even think to go in the turrets before selection unless I see in the bar that there are hunters and we have no pilots.</p>

If we say want to shoot Raluca to the face and not to destroy oxy, then you can do it in 12 ap extracting and injecting spore on the go. The thing is that you can get rid of fuel and get to commander easily, being any character on board. So it's not like you need to be lucky or the setup is different everytime.<br>You can play inactive for a few cycles, then inject, transfer, dump fuel. If you survive for a cycle, fuel is gone, commander is sitting outside, and something is wrong, because you'll have around 10 spare pa combined to act, you can go for a kill or try to saboteur or something. You also can easily weaken in shower and kill off you old body if you want.<br>It doesn't matter who are you, and what skills you have. It doesn't matter what other's are doing. You can actually go for it evey time you are mush on the first day of selection.</p>

                <p>I can't agree with "you cannot extract first spores, you are screwed". Sometimes it's hard. Sometimes it is just unreasonable - people can start watch over showerdorm immideately, and being dirty and sleepy for six cycles can rush their hand. Also, awakened crewmember who did nothing, went to bed, and slept for six cycles is also mushpicious as hell. Even pre-mush selection there is work to do, even during selection, so you better have a reason to be in bed, and not doing a thing. Or it is quite possible that you found youself out of it and with only 6 :pa: instead of 12.</p>

                <p>Well if you extracted already it means you have missing AP and took a shower or are idling around dirty. I am pretty sure running to the shower dorm right after selection and then sleeping there is getting mush Finola, Paola killed at least, and Raluca if Janice is in the other dorm. For lots of other characters it might not be instadeath but people will be watching you and if torturer Chao is around he can pay you a visit.</p><p>Chao doesn't get AP from beds, so if you're him, hope mush hunt, anti-mush research, etc doesn't make any progress while you're being inactive for 2 days.</p>

You should rest for like 2-3 cycles to get full bar. It's not really an issue. And sped up version of the plan can deal even with like 8 or less ap.

And you are 100% certain to succesfully burn 18 fuel in one go for like.... 5 pa?<br>The worst part if even if you get to the ship, capsule lottery can give humans a fast fuel capsule from hunters if you are in a patroller, or you can be shoot down by hunters in pashie on the other hand if someone will eventually bring you down when you are in a pashie, the next space pilot mush will be totally immortal in a patroller, there will be no remaining way to get him without fuel, he can shoot down traders, and the only thing left to do for humans is to get to sol... if they are sure that there is no third mush. And if they are clever boys and researched the MagNet... than that's a GG i suppose?

                <p>Let us assume we aren't breaking O2, only loading fuel and transferring to commander there. AD-RC-RS-ER-RS-ER-RS-ER-AB2-AB-CC-FC-Bridge is 13 MP = 12 MP and 1 AP. Getting spore extracted - up to 4 AP - by the time you were resting human team could easily make a first research or two. Transferring - two more. And most important... are you sure that Commander is on the bridge? Because he could be elsewhere. That left you with a whollotasort of troubles on your hands. But let assume that everything went according to the plan, now Mush1 is in Jin Su. He cannot rush back to load all that fuel himself (it is even more costly, and he doesn't wait you with full gauges, so it is up to Mush2 to load fuel. Any human who have seen cycle changes is free to join the fun and start killing Mush2 or Jin Su or guarding something, and you can read forums with AP threads - right now one of the last mention Gioele with killing glee following poor mush. One misstep, and you or partner are dead, and no second jump at all. Nine fuel is bad, but not very bad, and even 18 isn't so harsh. And even with two fuels grabbed from bodies or stealed from Combustion Chamber at the last moment, it's quite possible to find HC planet and survive just as well.</p><p>Next point is about traders. Shooted trader doesn't disappear immediately, if shot once, you have to shoot him down thoroughly, and with 16 hp - again, it is costly, costly, costly. You don't add all that small prices, but in the end they will be there to bite you back. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I guess I am not convinced that fuel is that essential, that a shortage of fuel alone will kill a ship. All they have to do is survive on the Daedalus longer than you and your partners survive in their patrollers, then go home. At any point if they get a single fuel, maybe because Paola caught the trade ship before you, then they've won because they can hop the ship to kill you with or without the mag net.</p><p>You're also not invincible in a patroller even in retreat mode with 0 fuel. If the patrol ship breaks you have 1 cycle to repair or be ejected into space and die. I don't think second mush is getting into space anyway, unless it's NERON admin or a pilot. HK is closely guarded on most ships, if for some reason it isn't on this random one, it sure will be after the first person abuses the pilot lock.</p><p>In my suggested variant, it doesn't matter if you die once you're up in space. The point isn't to be invincible, it's to deprive them of plants, techs and the Pasi, which makes for a really hard to survive situation for the human team because it will take a long time to repair Pilgred, but they don't have a long time before they asphyxiate. Yes they can find oxy planet and do trades but the O2 ticks down by itself and you do really need it. So they are going to have to <em>keep on</em> finding those oxy planets, and also repair everything you broke without techs, and repair Pilgred without techs, I think crew is going to be stretched pretty thin. Killing traders up there is just a bonus, and if you miss a trade ship in the middle of the night, you're probably going to still win. I think if you wanted, you could eject as soon as you got up there. Which I think would actually let you use this plan if they did have the mag net because I think ejected ships don't get returned (not sure)?</p>

If the patrol ship breaks you have 1 cycle to repair or be ejected into space and die.</cite><br>That would be pretty hilarious but the chances that specially THIS patrol ship will break are pretty low.</p><p><cite>I don't think second mush is getting into space anyway, unless it's NERON admin or a pilot.</cite><br>Or he can just follow your footsteps and get into space with another transfer any day, any time. And bring the shrink\pilot and one more dead former shell with him.</p><p><cite>Which I think would actually let you use this plan if they did have the mag net</cite><br>Well if you burning up the fuel, magnet is useless anyway because they can't jump at all. So it's not a big deal.</p><p>The point of the plan is that oxy will run out eventually. If you are doing it early on, the humans just won't have enough plants to boost oxy even slightly, and with no fuel they can't search for O2 at all. So they have less then 2 days to sort out everything. The second mush can be\kill\transfer techs anytime they'll make a move on pilgred if needed and the first one is not gone, he is here waitng to strike, sabotage or return to Sol by himself with commander title if he is not guarded all the time. So if the humans are not perfect creatures with steel nerves and cold heads, they are screwed, really hard.</p>

                <p>IIRC broken patrol ships eject pilot on day change only. Also "collecting" ejected people with Pasiphae seems to be broken, I'm not sure if anyone ever did it.</p><br><br><br><p>Burning 18 fuel and taking off with remaining 2 seems to be good, especially if you're commander.</p><p>Optimally you want to move ship shortly before cycle change and then right after to minimise chances of getting killed/injured before taking off.</p><p>Let's assume you start in AD with full AP and 6 MP, scooter with 6 charges is in BD, you will get +1 AP/MP during cycle change. Taking scooter and moving to RBS/RAS will take 4 MP. To make things simpler let's assume scooter isn't used for loading fuel. It will take 6 MP to load 9 fuel and go back to RBS/RAS thus leaving you at 10/2. Moving to Bridge and moving the ship will take 1 AP and 5 MP, leaving you at 8/2. Cycle change happens and you're at 9/3. Moving to RBS/RAS is 5 MP, it leaves you at 8/3. Loading fuel without scooter brings you down to 7/0. You have to take 2 fuel capsules and move the ship again, this will leave you at 5/0 at Bridge. Moving to AB2 and taking off will cost 2 AP, 4 MP so 2AP/1MP would remain after that. You can eject for 1 AP if you have spacesuit which is probably your best bet if you're afraid crew may rush for magnetic net. Also most of the time you can grab 1 unit of fuel because moving to a planet requires at least 2 fuel.</p><p>So it's doable for Jin Su, he doesn't even need any mush skills. Other commanders would have to leave fuel in the tank, transfer into Janice/pilot after moving the ship twice, grab fuel in the new body and take off. It shouldn't be too hard but you have to make sure your transfer target has some AP.</p><p>It gets far more tricky if you're not commander and you plan on transfering into Jin Su because your new body would need a relatively big number of AP/MP. If Constipaspore Serum is done you can get 8 AP in your new body from phagocyte if you transfer right before day change with fertile. But that would require you to have gold mode and lvl 11 Mush.</p><br><br><br><p>So it should be viable assuming your ship has less than 21 fuel and no space capsules. It's comparable to setting Daedalus on fire and hijacking extinguishers with Pasiphae except most of the time humans have the option to prevent it by securing extinguisher blueprint/one of extinguishers.</p>

                <p>Thanks for the input WeakestLink.<br>But still there are few issues.<br>First, if you start not as commander in AD and want to transfer you'll need only.<br>10mp to load the fuel and return to AD, and only 6 ap to extract, spike and transfer if you haven't did it earlier. If you actually did, then you have around 8 more ap to rampage.</p><p>Then assuming that you transfer target is in AD, you need.<br>4mp to get to bridge.<br>1 ap to move the ship.<br>4mp to go back to dorm and restore 2ap and 1 mp<br>Then you need same 10 mp to load the fuel and get to the AB, then you need 3 mp to get to the bridge, and 1ap to launch. Then you are restoring at least 1ap 1mp on cycle change if you are alive till then. Then you need 3-4mp and 2 ap to take off.<br>So let's count.<br>mp is (4mp+4mp-1mp+10mp+3mp-1mp+4mp) = 23 mp<br>ap is (1ap -2ap + 1ap-1ap+2ap) = 1 ap (lol)<br>So with converting let's say you started at 5 mp. You need 7 ap on Jin Su to do everything, less with scooter, and 4 more you can grab wih spores (you spend 2 to extract and eat them right away) if you counted right and doing it on day change or injected JinSu first time the day before or by other mush. So we need Jin Su at like 3ap and 5mp to do everything we need if you are mid lvl silver mush. If you are high level golden mush, then you don't even care, you can get almost all the ap you need right away from 0.</p><p><cite>You can eject for 1 AP if you have spacesuit which is probably your best bet if you're afraid crew may rush for magnetic net.</cite><br>Well, it's not like they can use MagNet at all if they have no fuel, so you can chill and think about you puns against the humans after they notice what happened.</p><p>All that can be actually done right in the end of the cycle of mush selection. That way you'll have needed ap, and Jin Su will have his ap for sure, still it will be hard to survive the cycle after the second jump I can't find a reliable way to survive a full cycle on the jumping ship, so you'll have to bullshit your way out of this, and I doubt it helps if someone will check that this is not the first but already the second jump in a row. But if stole the armor and hard boiled, good chances that you can actually laught at their attempts mostly, you still have 1-2 spores to eat too.</p>

                <p>Most effective mush strategies needs often a sacrifice.<br>The better version of your fuel strategy is to get rid of HK first before taking off as commander since you are invincible then- with exception of hunters shooting at you, a high level Kuan Ti, asphyxiation or patrol craft failure problems.<br>But that would need a cooperating partner and some preparation. And if you have such one why not enjoying together the time to win over the ship secretely? Makes probably more fun than being alone with yourself in the mush channel.</p>

                <p>I think my main issue with the original plan is this: it's not very adaptable and not very robust. A single thing goes against plan and it all falls apart. People have already brought up a lot of ways that this could go south and the rebuttal for most of them is "that's really unlikely, it won't happen". And that's true for a lot of these individual possibilities but the unintuitive thing about probability is that even with a 99% average chance of not running into a rare event, your success rate still drops pretty far the more events you need to avoid. If there are 100 events that you have a 1/100 chance of seeing, your chance of seeing none of them is like 36 percent. Which means you fail two thirds of the time. If there are 200 such strange cases it falls to 13 percent. Remember this assumes you avoid each event 99% of the time.</p><p>The plan is very all or nothing. E.g. you count on 0 fuel and as soon as there's 1 fuel by any rare event, the ship is hopped and you die, so it must be 0 and 0 exactly. There's no half points for getting half the plan done, your work is just competely erased like it was nothing. There are too many of these rare events that absolutely devastate the plan instead of just setting it back. I think you need to actually try this plan and I think you will find that you fail for a reason you didn't foresee and couldn't have expected. And I think if you keep trying it you will see it fail in a a variety of "unforeseeable" ways. Unforeseeable stuff always happens in Mush so I don't really trust a plan that is "foolproof" but can't adapt to circumstance.</p>

                <p>Well the thing about lots of events is true. But this plan is actually made to minimize the number of things that can go south. You can't be detected in preperation. You doing nothing suspicios, human's don't have time to test each other, and you dealing with straight up % things, like capsules from hunters and not some random human behaivor. And there is only 2 ways of getting fuel left.<br>The main problem of the plan right now is to survive one whole cycle while jumping the second time. There is nothing that can go wrong before this. You don't even care who you are or what others doing.<br>If you survive this one cycle, there are only 4 possibilities for humans to win.<br>1.) Get space capsule.<br>2.) Wait for trader<br>3.) KIll the second mush and go to Sol.<br>4.) You patroller can break in the space (but that won't nessesary bring you down)</p><p>And those are the only 4 things that can bring you down. And you blocking either 1 or 2 by beingh in the pashipae or Patroller accordingly, the problem is that hunter will destroy you in pashipae in time, so if you are alone you should take patroller. If pashipae already destroyed, then 1 and 2 can't happen. So the only way for human team to win is 3. And that's higly unlikely if they can't get any more oxy from the game start and you partner doing nothing suspicios. Also even if they kill him they don't know how much mushes are on board.<br>The meaning of the plan is actually figuring out most universal plan that doesn't relly at all on you character and on the activity of anyone else. For example even if you are Finola you can do it just fine.</p>

                <p>No there are lots of other things that can totally hamstring your plan not even counting new things, just what's already been said. For one thing it requires you have free run of the ship for 3 hours, so you can jump twice. But lots of people check their Mush at least in the morning before school or work and in the evening after school or work, and most of the player base is spread across North America and Europe. If you look at a time zone chart and think about it you will see easily that there's no such safe cycle. Your odds of failure on that one are much much higher than 1 percent, I would say closer to 25% <strong>per active human character</strong>. I don't think anything anyone can say will convince you though (since you keep forgetting the various problems in the plan) so all I can really say is, if it works then prove it next time you are mush.</p>

                <p>Duh, I said many times that this free cycle is the main problem of the plan. And i told about the other problems. Each "Stealthy" plan has a lot of points to fail and it's a long one. One wrong word can get you killed, but if you are dealing with game mechanic straigh away, chances actually much higher.</p>
