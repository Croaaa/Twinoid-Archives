We (the community) will vote on bugs that are most important to us<br>2. MT dev(s) will attach a price tag to let's say first 10<br>3.

IMO the main problem that would be worth solving is the number of simultaneous ships, but it is a matter of time rather than money, although it's related.</p>

                <p>Sadly, this can't work. Reasons:</p><ul><li>Time spent on old games is time not spent on going forward and creating new games to attract new people. Even if paid at the right price, this is not something that helps the future of the company, which is quite a high concern at the moment.</li><li>Blackmagic, the main dev, has left Motion Twin without explaining how the code works, and it's a mess. Fixing even a minor bug would require to understand the structure of the whole game to find where the bug lies and to make sure the fix won't break anything (and it will break something anyway). We're talking weeks here.</li><li>This list is not up to date, most major bugs are fixed and the others are quite minor or impact only a few ships. Even if we were to pick only the top 10 in it, it would be quite a disappointing update for a lot of work and it would barely improve our game experience.</li><li>I think you underestimate a lot the cost of development and overestimate a lot the amount of money the community would put into this. Mush has always been barely profitable, I can't see people suddenly throwing money at the devs for this.</li></ul><p>Crowdfunding is a nice idea. Fixing those bugs would be nice. But nice won't be of much help in this situation that everyone whishes would be better.</p>

                <p>I think this is a great idea. I can understand there being a problem with the game not being profitable enough, but there is a fairly big community that love this game and want to help. So let the community help, let them come up with new features, host a crowdfunding, and maybe try to come with ways to make it more profitable.</p><p>Personally, I love this game. I made some art I wanted to give over to the team for characters alternate outfits. There's a tiny source of income, if they charge for the outfits. One idea I had was an outfit for each character would get unlocked after a certain number of cycles playing as that character, a feature that would encourage a player to keep playing the game. Bringing in new features brings in new players, and keeps the old ones from leaving.</p>

This game has so much potential and I think it can still reach to a broader audience with some better marketing. There is almost nothing like it out there and if done right this game is amazing (I really love RP ships, like... they are unique!).<br>I think, as a digital artist myself, that new skins as rewards and some alternative Daedalus pixel design could benefit the game a lot as a marketing strategy, at least from an aesthetic point of view.</p><p>Imagine how cool it would be to change from the regular "Daedalus look" into a "Crappy Rebel Ship" kind of thing, where the rooms are more tech-detailed, chaotic and filthy, like in a darker mood with more pipes, vents, leaks and sparks/steam.<br>This "Ship Skin" can change even in the holyday seasons (Halloween, Christmas, etc). The Daedalus deserves so much better than the plain design it already has.</p><p>These things could even be done by the community in most part (of course the devs would have to do their work selecting the better looking ones, putting them up and all the coding and stuff).</p>

                <p>Last time I played was about 2-3 years ago. One of the things that has kept me from playing is the dev's lack of love for it's own product, the gloomy mood that surrounds every proposition that is made. The untranslated french words that <em>still</em> cling on to this day on the site and even some of the games are a worrying sign of low commitment.</p><p>Every time the community's pushed for something or tried talking points on improving the game the standard response was "it's impossible. it'll never happen". The sort of attitude that gets nothing done. And here we are, fast forward a few years and it's not changed for good. At least there are seasonal changes.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to sound nagging but as they say, honesty is the best policy. <br>Mush is a kickass game, very unique in it's own way.<br>I honestly wish for Mush, MT, Twinoid, etc. to be around forever and thrive. <br>Sometimes I get worried it won't.</p><p>I'll probably try jumping into a ship one of these days. Worried it may be too time-consuming.</p>

                <p>I'm not a representative of Motion Twin or Twinoid, but I don't see how such a thing could ever be guaranteed. There is no guarantee that any business or product anywhere in the world would have a lifecycle to survive all eternity. The financial institution you bank at could go belly-up tomorrow. Microsoft might decide to close their doors and stop supporting Windows. As someone with a business management degree, I'd consider it illogical to think otherwise. A product like Mush simply cannot have a product lifecycle with no end in sight.</p><p>Motion Twin has probably made a comment saying something along the lines of an intention to keep the game available, and have a staff member available in case emergency bug fixes or server issues, but I don't want to put words in their mouth and I just don't know the official statement.</p><p>Development was stopped, I figure mainly because development was determined to be unprofitable. I have no information on finances, but I'd assume that if the current state of the game became unprofitable enough, the plug would be pulled. That just makes sense from a business perspective.</p>

                <p>I don't suppose that if, in the case that the game becomes so unprofitable that Motion Twin chose to shut it down entirely, they could be convinced to open source it? I understand why they wouldn't want to do that <em>now</em>, but in the event of a total shutdown I think that would be a nice gesture to the players who supported them through Mush. It would allow people to run a community server and maybe even work on some of those bug fixes/minor improvements.</p>

If I remember right, Mush was ran by mainly only one dev, who knew the code and how everything worked. Noone else knew the code and still does not. That dev is gone now and is unwilling/able to come back and Twinoid is not wanting to risk a new dev breaking something just for a few minor bugs. Sure we could raise money but wouldnt it be more logical for them to continue running the game for a steady profit instead of risking it being shut down for a slightly larger project?</p>

Can't they just store a copy and rollback if they do break something so important?</cite><p>Yeah they can. Even if the current state of things is so bad that there's currently no version control, you can always just add the entire codebase into a fresh repo as a big lump and go from there. Probably the issue is more along the lines of the codebase being pretty incomprehensible, so the cost of having developers add new features would be more than it's worth, especially with the player base tapering off.</p><p>It also wouldn't surprise me if there was zero testing infrastructure (automated tests etc) either. So it would be hard to know as a new developer to the project if you've introduced a bug until someone else finds that bug in the wild, which could actually hurt revenue if the introduced bug/s create enough frustration that people stop playing as much.</p>
