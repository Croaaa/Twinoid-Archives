                <p><strong>Since it is far too large for the "short questions and answers" thread, I thought I may as well make an easily-edited summary of how everyone connects together and the story leads to the start of the game. Corrections and discussion is welcomed.</strong></p><p>Chun was a nurse for an exploration team (including Eleesha's father) to a new mining world, the first one to encounter the Mush. The 'mothership' of the expedition was under the Command of Federation hero, Jin Su. Hua, a famed atmospheric entry pilot, and Frieda, the top astrophysicist of both her times, were also part of the expedition's crew but not the exploration team itself.<br>I would assume the Mush had to learn how to control humans since their first attempts killed everyone except Chun. She is studied, hassled by the media (including Eleesha), frozen then awakened in South America by Nils Carlsson, the intended biologist of the Daedalus. He decodes her genome and creates an anti-Mush vaccine before smuggling her to Xyloph in orbit of Jupiter('s moon?) to have some solitude as a janitor, where only Jin Su and Nils know her true identity.</p><p>The Mush start to spread to a nearby mining colony, which is vaccinated (with it advertised to protect against space flu). However, it's hinted that those who organised this effort were already infected so this could simply have infected them all/made them easier to be infected instead - rumours of this start to spread on the colony. The mistreatment of the miners and these rumours lead to a rebellion, but again it is suggested that this was caused by the Mush in a classic "Humans are too strong, make them kill each other off" scenario (anyone who has played Freelancer will know).<br>The SDF forces include:<br>-Terrence, a pilot whose craft exploded in the Sol war, the resulting crash causing the loss of use of his legs<br>-Derek, an incompetent but lucky soldier who is ordered to Xyloph, far away from where he can do damage to the war effort<br>-Roland, a skilled but arrogant pilot who is suspected (falsely) of infection and finds himself imprisoned and forced back into the war several times. He also pushes Eleesha out of an atmospheric vessel, causing her Vertigo<br>-Chao, who operates a (useless) healing version of the Natamy Rifle, which is tested on Roland<br>-Stephen, who at the time was serving as a military chef but avoided the conflict after being imprisoned and later sent to Xyloph.</p><p>Finola first comes in helping the to-be-rebel miners, as she has been working on that colony and later researches the infectees on both sides. Although Ian's biography mentions Eleesha helping him, Finola seems more appropriate. They create a prototype MycoScanner and other research into infection using rats, despite objections and red tape from their superiors.</p><p>The Magellan Ark Project was funded by Gioele (extra funding from the SDF comes later), who dreamed of travelling the stars. Kuan Ti designed it but didn't have enough time to complete the Ark itself (think Titan A.E. style), but a side project to create the Daedalus had more success. Kuan Ti was the one who inspired the child prodigy, Raluca, who designed the PILGRED system with him.<br>They had the help of a rogue calculator, NERON, who was only calmed down by the A.I. psychologist, Janice (with some assistance from Terrence). Jin Su was the SDF's representative, intended leader of the Ark and Commander of the Xyloph station where the project was based.<br>Hua was contacted by Jin Su again, joining the Magellan project to design the Icarus and helping Ian created the Hydroponics Garden. Despite retiring from her work, Frieda is also called back to join the crew of the Daedalus.</p><p>Eleesha does a lot of snooping around while looking for what happened to her father, discovering the research Nils Carlsson (who has since fallen ill) has done proving that the Federation leaders are infected. Taking this news to the Xyloph team, she joins them as a mechanic. She later informs the two researchers: Ian is terrified and joins the team; Finola is horrified at the idea of abandoning Sol so leaves to work on her own.</p><p>Having to increase the pace of the Daedalus project and include Mush research, Kuan Ti organises the kidnapping of Finola with Chao and Derek. This is where the timelines diverge: either Derek survives, Finola stays on Sol and Andie joins the team, or Chao sacrifices Derek to capture Finola.<br>Jin Su has to keep this new objective a secret from the infected President, but his efforts end up with him ordered to step down as leader and be replaced. After arriving, however, his replacement is soon killed and the SDF plan an assault to take back the Xyloph station.<br>Stephen escapes from his cell in the resulting attack and ends up hiding in the CryoModule, stowing away on the Daedalus.<br>Upon hearing of the state of the Federation, Gioele panics and tries to persuade Jin Su to replace Nils with his daughter, Paola. She is rebellious, having ran away from home with Stephen's mercenary team before being sent on a biology university course. Working with her boyfriend, she finds some hints of massive infection plans by the Mush-infected Federation. With Nils' ill-health and the station under attack, she takes his place aboard the ship, having to leave Kivanc behind.</p>

                <p><strong>Roleplay Applications</strong> - Obviously you can play however you wish, but if you want to try continuing the story as it has been given to us, consider the following:</p><p>All of you (except Steven, who is a stowaway) have been working together for anywhere from a few months to several years. <em>Andie</em> is the most recent arrival on a Derek/Andie ship, where on a Chao/Finola ship, <em>Finola</em> wakes up after being kidnapped from her lab on Antemis and put into cryo, with almost no idea of what is going on.</p><p>Notable Relationships-</p><p><strong>Eleesha</strong> is likely to be wary of Roland or his ideas, since he was responsible for the incident that gave her Chronic Vertigo. She also has met Chun and questioned her extensively about the disaster on Tamina, as well as interviewing Jin Su on the mission with less success. She is responsible for the publishing of many of Finola's findings on the Mush, and should be at least miffed at Kuan Ti for attempting to kidnap Finola (whether or not it was successful).</p><p><strong>Raluca</strong> should be familiar with Kuan Ti, as they have been exchanging ideas and working together for about 12 years (not counting cryosleep time). She also should know Janice, since it was her work that convinced NERON to cooperate - she can be impressed or jealous as you see fit. A common trait of persons on the Autism spectrum is a dislike of crowds and noise, and Raluca is no exception. She does get lonely, but that is what Schrodinger is for...</p><p><strong>Kuan Ti</strong> obviously has a fairly good relationship with Gioele, as the billionaire funds the Magellan project. He also should be on at least working terms with both Raluca and Jin Su, the other key parts of the project. He should be familiar with everyone's skills as the project leader.</p><p><strong>Paola</strong> is Gioele's daughter, though their relationship has been strained over the years. Are they joyfully reunited and repentant, or do they still bear hurts from fights? Up to you! Paola may recognize Stephen, as it was his crew that helped her run away to Mars. Paola also left behind her boyfriend and rebel networking partner Kivanc, who can be contacted through Xyloph.</p><p><strong>Gioele</strong> is Paola's father, and it's due to his bargaining that Paola is even on board, showing that however they interact now, he still cares about her safety. He was minimally involved during the Magellan Project (as neither a tech nor a physicist), until Jin Su was brought in as a representative of the Federation, at which point he started to involve himself closer and, learning of the Mush threat, did his best to secure places on board for himself and his daughter. If he knows Stephen helped Paola run away, he may bear a grudge.</p><p><strong>Janice</strong> attended university with Terrence, where they collaborated on robots and AI work. They continued working together on the Magellan project, where Janice convinced NERON to behave and assist Kuan Ti and Raluca. Janice and NERON are the reason that the crew was able to escape the SDF forces assaulting the base.</p><p><strong>Chao</strong> is something of a loose canon. He and <em>Derek</em> worked together as security forces for the Magellan project and have been in the field fighting rebellions that the Mush may have been manipulating. Several people are dead because of him, most notably <em>Derek</em> (assumed, as he did not return from the kidnapping mission), and the replacement SDF representative. Incidentally, that's why you all had to flee in such a hurry...</p><p><strong>Finola</strong> is an unwilling member of this expedition, and is likely to be upset if not outright hostile for the first few cycles. First in her bad list are Chao, who physcially kidnapped her, and Jin Su and Kuan Ti, who authorized the kidnapping when she declined an invitation to the project. She is on better terms with Eleesha (who was outraged at the kidnapping) and Ian, with whom she worked while investigating the Mush.</p><p><strong>Chun</strong> was a simple nurse on the Tamina mission, until it all went wrong. As the only survivor, she is frozen for 9 years while her unique genes are analyzed for what makes her immune to the mush. She can be sullen, resigned, vengeful, proud... however you choose to have her react to prodding scientists and invasive journalists. She has been extensively interviewed by Eleesha, but when she joins the Magellan project under an assumed identity, only Jin Su knows who she is. The rest of the crew find out who she really is less than a year before they are forced to flee.</p>

                <p><strong>Frieda</strong> was born in an earlier era and frozen when she reached the limits of study with the technology of her time. After being thawed, she has worked with Jin Su on expedition missions, but never quite got to achieve her dream of actually setting foot on the far-off worlds she had studied. Jin Su called her out of her retirement to serve as the navigator for the Magellan Project. It was not known if she would survive cryosleep a second time.</p><p><strong>Hua</strong> is a skilled pilot and an experienced and capable explorer. She has piloted for Jin Su in previous missions, and helped test the spacecraft for the Daedalus along with Roland. She also assisted Ian in setting up the garden for the Daedalus... too bad it didn't survive the 16 years of being untended while they were frozen.</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong> is the man in charge of running the ship. An experienced pilot and leader who has been dealing with handling people, missions, and tactics since his teens. <em>Chao</em> , <em>Derek</em> , and <em>Andie</em> are his direct subordinates; the rest of the crew are not military, and thus have fewer problems with challenging his authority and orders. The discovery that the SDF have been infiltrated by the Mush may weigh heavily on him, or he could be outraged at the audacity of the fungus and be planning revenge.</p><p><strong>Stephen</strong> is the odd man out here. While all the other members of the crew were invited, Stephen stumbled in while fleeing an execution squad, and faked being a scientist until they realized he knew nothing about the Mush. He broke out of detention during the SDF attack and snuck into cryo. He's played many roles in his life and adapts to situations quickly to make the best out of them. He may recognize Paola, as he helped her get to Mars and was arrested and jailed for it.</p><p><strong>Ian</strong> is a peaceful man, though whether he is timid, cowardly, or just zen is up to you! He has experienced the aftermath of battle when the mining colony he was part of mutinied. That is how he met Finola (not Eleesha, as the bio claims). They engaged in intensive study of the Mush until Ian leaves for the Magellan project - Finola may feel he abandoned her and the miners they were trying to save. Ian is responsible for the Daedalus' gardens, with help from Hua, though the plants were mostly destroyed during the 16 years of cryosleep.</p><p><strong>Roland</strong> is carefree and a little lax about following the rules. He has been responsible for countless infractions (including his jump with Eleesha) and pranks, some of which have come back to bite him... rather hard. Despite his playing with the rules, Roland is honorable at heart; he was branded a deserter of the SDF because he refused to bomb civilian colonies. His raw pilot skills have been further refined by working with Hua for the Daedalus.</p><p><strong>Terrence</strong> is a pilot at heart, but thanks to the accident that cost him the use of his legs, he could no longer be part of the SDF fleet. Instead he turns to robotics and engineering, and works closely with Janice to develop drones that could be used against the Mush. These drones assisted a great deal with the actual construction of the Daedalus, though they were mostly lost when they had to flee the SDF. Terrence had trouble integrating with his squad as a young pilot; perhaps he is cocky? Arrogant? Has he learned his lesson since losing his wings, or has he become bitter instead?</p><p><strong>Derek</strong> is a womanizer and very confident in his abilities. He has been known to lie to make himself look better, and most of his success is due to sheer luck. However, his terrible strategy has seen him shifted from post to post. He served on the Magellan project under Jin Su, worked alongside <em>Chao</em>, and was Andie's training Sergeant in an SDF academy (though he doesn't recall this). At the time of launch, his pride might be stinging from the failed kidnapping as well as being chased off by the SDF, but he should recover his swagger in no time.</p><p><strong>Andie</strong> is an open book for roleplay. Male? Female? Both? Neither? Oblivious to everyone else's confusion or secretly enjoying it? You can play them however you want! Andie is extremely intellegent, (even if you don't take the Polyvalent skill) and has enjoyed the luxury of a private education in SDF facilities. With that education came a constant stream of how wonderful the Federation was, and how everything would be solved if people just followed the laws and obeyed their superiors. Andie is desperate to please their superiors (Jin Su and Derek), hero worships Derek, and still believes that they are serving the Federation up until the SDF comes pounding on their door. Is Andie crushed by the betrayal of everything they have known to be good? In denial? Angry at the corruption of their beloved government? You could also throw in a bit of looking down on Roland (a deserter) and all the characters who have had to flee the Federation at some point in their history (Stephen, Eleesha).</p>

                <p>No worries about hijacking the thread, it's relevant and a good place to put it. I'd touched on some of the relationships, and did a specific one for Chun in another thread for someone who was wondering about her RP. I've only really been on the one high-standard RP ship, playing as Jin Su, but have had a couple of moments on other ships as Kuan Ti and Raluca. For example, the relationship between those two was something I'd considered as "reasonable for the Thing"...<br>Paola and Stephen could be similar, especially if she is being RPed as a 'proper' rebel ("I hated the SDF before I knew they were Mush" - <em>Hipster Paola</em>). She'd be the main one to stick up for his usefulness, to the extreme annoyance of her father.</p><p>The only thing I noticed that I'd disagree on is your blaming of Chao for their current mess. When they sent Barakov (although I think they used the name for someone else who took part in the war, unless it is the same character who survived his forces being beaten) it was a forced-but-not-hostile takeover of the project. They'd had a year or so without having to report that most of the work was going into the Daedalus to fight against the infected SDF, so when Jin Su could no longer keep them at bay it was be taken over immediately or buy a little time (which obviously worked, since they got away).</p><p>The room for extra characters is pretty interesting, such as the scenario where Paola sticks with Stephen's mercenary gang - Nils takes her place and Derek/Andie/new character? takes his.</p>

                <p>Seconding all the nice words here. Very, very well-written, concise summaries. Some tidbits:</p><p>After being imprisoned, <strong>Stephen</strong> worked in the Boxylium mines operated by the Rinaldo corporation. Even if he doesn't know Gioele from the Paola kidnapping, he might know him as the guy in charge of a despotic hellhole. (It's also possible Gioele pulled some strings to have Stephen arrested on a graver charge, as 'helping a girl travel' is nowhere near 'corrupting a minor'.) Also, you can't really overstate Stephen's adaptability--he's gone from a bellboy to a senator to a mercenary to a chef. No doubt he's picked up plenty of bits and pieces along the way.<br><br>Young <strong>Gioele</strong> used to have dreams of space exploration, and thanks to his father's influence ended up on the good ship Gonzak with GL Maubrick, Frieda Bergmann and Kim Jin Su. Then, thanks to his father's death, he abruptly took over the prison operation. As evidenced by the fact that he was later willing to launch the contest that led to the construction of the Daedalus, that was probably not exactly what he wanted to do with his life. Now he's adrift in the great black yonder on a ship he paid for. Can this be somewhat comforting, or is the stress of constant paranoia too much?<br><br><strong>Gioele</strong> and <strong>Paola</strong> are...complicated. That tends to be how father-daughter relationships between anti-government anti-expansionist rebels and colonialism-supportive mine-running billionaires are.<br><br><strong>Andie</strong> is an orphan who was taken in by the SDF, so the act of leaving them is just as personal as it is ideological.<br><br><strong>Derek</strong> has failed at basically everything, and if it hadn't been for some amazing strokes of luck he would be nobody. Whether or not he knows this, and whether or not he hugs his pillow at night in horrifying awareness of his imposter status, is up to the roleplayer, although he's definitely aware of some of his lies (like the scar he got shaving that's <em>totally</em> from the Tau-Ceti trenches, yup).<br><br><strong>Kuan Ti</strong>'s an ardent fan of science fiction whose dreams are facilitated by his massive amounts of charisma or ability to inspire (he's had the idea of the Magellan Ark since he was twelve, and if he hadn't run into Raluca its construction would have been completely impossible). Possible delusions of grandeur. Possible hero complex. The man wears a cape.<br><br><strong>Finola</strong> might not know Kuan Ti was partly responsible for the decision to kidnap her. Chao, definitely, Jin Su's probably suspected as he's the top dog, but Kuan Ti's involvement wouldn't be obvious. Eleesha would probably try to inform her as soon as possible, though.<br><br><strong>Hua</strong> and <strong>Roland</strong> spent 36 hours shipwrecked on the surface of Mercury after an accident while testing the Icarus. Might have created a deep bond of friendship, might just have made them permanently fed up with each other, but either way they probably know more about one another than they do anyone else on the ship.</p>

                <p>The thing is, Jin Su did step down as representative rather than force the hand of the mush-infected SDF, probably to buy them time. Chao shot the replacement instead of realizing the idea was to work behind his back, and gave the SDF the reason they needed to invade. The way I see it, they already wanted in and were suspicious of the crew that had been assembled.</p><p>But obviously, this is all "RP applications according to Isidarth," so you can choose to interpret the situation as you see fit!

                <p>It is of course just interpretation, but it doesn't explicitly say how Jin Su was relieved. I guess there were SDF security on the Xyloph station (probably not Mush), so they'll have "we have orders to take you in, sir"-d him, although it could just be that he was told to step down and Barakov was to relieve him in person. Why would Chao, Derek (and presumably Andie) be told about the infected status of the SDF if the possible rest of the Xyloph team wasn't?<br>I suppose the plan would have been to work around Bakarov, but it's very fitting for Chao to just dive on him with a blaster and froth round his mouth as soon as he steps onto the station <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I'd almost forgotten the Mercury landing, although it seems to me as if they didn't finish off Roland's bio given the lack of anything between that and the launch of the Daedalus. I guess if he was his usual joker self, Hua would definitely get fed up of him rather than bond!</p>

While all the other members of the crew were invited, Stephen stumbled in while fleeing an execution squad, and faked being a scientist until they realized he knew nothing about the Mush. He broke out of detention during the SDF attack and snuck into cryo. He's played many roles in his life and adapts to situations quickly to make the best out of them.

I can imagine she'd kind of resent it, but the conflict of interest/clash of groups is there. It's possible to play her as an armchair activist, too, not being directly invested in what she's talking about but choosing it as her pet cause because it's a way to take down her dad. (Another thing to think about: She might only be able to effectively protest her father's operation because she has resources opened up to her by her father's wealth. Complicated!)</p><p>Edit: This is in reference to the previous post about her being bratty, growing up as a rich kid, etc. Also, you might not put it past Paola, but would you put it past Stephen? He was 35 at the time. Might trip some creepout sensors. Definitely agree about 'don't play it as that if the other isn't fine with it', though, as a general rule. If you're going to divert from the norm, you should probably PM anyone involved in that ahead of time.</p><p>Edit edit: Also, on the subject of Mercury and Hua being fed up, I'm just gonna link <a target="_blank" href="http://dismalditties.tumblr.com/post/85633807896/donation-commission-for-anne-a-couple-of">this</a> again.

                <p>As with most of these events, it's phrased slightly differently in each bio that mentions it. Kuan Ti's says that it was his idea and he goes to Jin Su with it, who gives the orders to Chao (and Derek). It's possible that Chao doesn't even know Kuan Ti was involved, and as mentioned above, Finola would know Chao but probably guess at Jin Su's involvement.</p>

                <p>Any information in the backstory how the hunters were able to intercept a ship in a PILGRED jump and how are the hunters able to reach the middle-of-nowhere where the ship is after 16 years of PILGRED flight?

                <p>I've actually started talking about that in my NRJ log. My guess is that there will have been designs left behind for smaller, more efficient versions (the Mk I and II being large and unfinished for the Ark; Mk III being the one on the Daedalus that we all know and love) that Raluca had dreamed up. Alternatively, they've just upgraded it themselves with their own AI and team (assuming NERON's entire self was transferred to the Daedalus).</p><p>As for why they haven't been able to intercept them, perhaps they didn't know the exact trajectory of the Daedalus' return (Sol is kind of a big place, and we don't know how far each Command Console jump takes you) whereas the Xyloph computer will have logged their initial one.</p>
