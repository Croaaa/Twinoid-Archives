                <p>This game is great, I really enjoy it. The worst problem with this game, in my opinion, is that sometimes it takes forever to get a full ship. I'm currently nearing day 3 and only 5 people (including myself) have woken up. I really miss seeing full ships on day 1, and with a game as fun as MUSH, it really makes me sad. How can we get a bigger playerbase?</p>

                <p>My son has played this game but much prefers Minecraft (although he did like Galaxy55, a now defunct game from Motion Twin). I've shared the link to Mush on Facebook - not one comment received about it. I've told some friends about it but if they have joined, they haven't told me.</p><p>There was interest via youtube with those videos but as the seasons change and new features/skills/rules evolve, some of that information is out of date.</p><p>I've seen some mush fan art on other sites.</p><p>I've played a fair few online games... most send spam emails... I've never ever ever had a spam email off Motion Twin or pretending to be from them, although Carapass reminds me that it has been a while (nooo, all 1 point balls <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico">)...</p>

                <p>We already have enough new players as is . Recently been meeting new players , allot of them and active ones even thought with lack of knowledge or sometimes even mute . . .</p><p>If somehow more new players were attracted here we would start getting half idle ships which mostly ended as now we usually get 2 idlers at start and more join idler team after trying game for a day or few . <span class="tid_wspoil">As example my last ship that lasted 17 days , we had no idlers , but as days passed they showed lack of activity and died from starvation or depression or even accidents of which started about at day 8 and in total there were 4 of them. Who knows how many dropped the game for good and how many just got bored for the time being or had irl problems. All of them were new players. </span></p><p>Instead of trying to attract new players into the game i would rather want old ones back that already have experience and are willing to play the game and won't drop after 1-2 days or even right away while still in ship . Sadly currently we are not gonna get anything new and interesting soon so it seems that we need to be patient ....</p>

                <p>I also think best way to attract new players with good quality is spreading the word to people you know from somewhere and who probably would like it. It is certainly a game for certain people - mostly either RP-loving or strategists/analysts or people interested into psychology/communication/convincing methods (or combination of it).</p><p>And since it needs often regular activity i would not recommend it to everyone...</p>

                <p>I am a regular at one of the best-known Werewolf/Mafia forums on the Internet and I have considered promoting Mush on there given that this is very much the type of game that would appeal to those people. However, given the sorry state of affairs when it comes to random ships not filling up until Day 3 I simply cannot in good faith promote this game to people who, since they are new, would need to spend significant time on random ships figuring out some fundamentals and grinding a bit of XP.</p><p>If Motion Twin ever takes the time to make the necessary code changes to reduce the number of ships that spawn at once then maybe the situation would be different.</p>
