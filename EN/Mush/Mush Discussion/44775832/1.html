I'm also a developper, which lead me to the main purpose of this message.</em></p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">I created LeaderMush with the help of <span class="tid_user tid_user_121864 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="121864">Linkat</span>. This application uses the Mush API, that allows applications to gather information from current and past games. It's not just a simple script, it's a whole new experience. It will allow in the first public release, a leaderboard of all Mush Ships that existed since the creation of Mush. <br>Every ship will appear on it and there will be different ranking filters. We'd also like to create a kind of new <strong>triumph</strong> ranking. We want, with the ship information, to create a ranking not based on single performance, but group performance.<br><br><em>For example, the ship 2488 had 11 spores on board during the whole experience. Those spores created will lower the overall scoring of the ship. There was also 4 mushes, that will also reduce the score. On the bright side, the serum was completed, which is a great achievement, so it will increase the score.</em><br><br>Let's talk about overall. This application will not just allow FR users to get on the leaderboard, it will allow EN and ES people to be on the leaderboards, with a flag of the language besides it. That will bring a more competitive aspect to the game.</span></p><p><cite>The application first release date is still not fixed yet, but we expect by the end of March.</cite></p><p><strong>We haven't talked about it on the French servers, because we want to start off with the smaller community, even though EN people are way putting way more life in their game <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">, to make a decent DB of the EN ships. You can understand that with all the ships existing and the small quota we are able to pull from the API per day, we want beta-testers for our application. It will be easier to gather data publically after, because games already entered in the DB won't need to request the server again, it'll just add the player name to the ship.</strong></p><p>We'd also like to get an input from your community about a new scoring system based on ships. Here's all the information we can pull from past ships:</p><pre>Total spores made
Explorations completed
Hunter destroyed
Number of mushes
Planets scanned
Projects done (number)
Rebel bases contacted (number)
Researches done (number)
Creation Date
Cycles survived
Destruction date
Ship ID
Pilgred done or not
Projects done (list)
Researches done (list)
Season</pre><p>If you have any suggestions for the project, or for the scoring system, discuss about it down below, or send me a PM, I'll read them all.</p><p><cite>For FR users that pass by, keep it for yourself...</cite></p>
