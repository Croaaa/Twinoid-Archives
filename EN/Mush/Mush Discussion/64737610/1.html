                <p>I've recently noticed that almost all games end up with a mush rampage, and it happens more and more early in the game. Now they rampage almost right after getting out of the cryo. But why? To be honest, I think I can understand that. People don't like to play as mush because it's:</p><p>1) Hard. You're outnumbered and it's almost impossible to destroy the ship against a good and active crew. Not the main reason in my opinion.</p><p>2) Absolutely not rewarding. Now, that's a thing. While humans getting their glory point every cycle just for that, the mush is inevitably losing it, and twice more than humans, where's a logic in that??? So the game says: Hey if you want points, do something and quickly!</p><p>But what are the options? <br> <br> a) Contaminate. Alright, but how many infections can you make per game, really? 1-4 at best, maybe? With the first research being done quickly, it's getting almost impossible to produce and carry spores. Yeah, and how many points do we get for spiking? One. Wow, that'll sure compensate half of your initial points lost while waiting for a chance to spike someone.<br> <br> b) Convert human. Same as above. While waiting a chance to convert someone you're already near to 0 points. The reward for this action - 8 glory. Yes, we're bathing in points here.<br> <br> c) Sneak to Sol or Eden. Welp, we're getting significantly more here, but c'mon... It's the end of the game! At this point, we are at 0 points! Besides, it's almost impossible to do. And that pity 16-32 points we're getting for this are nothing! <br> <br> d) Humanocide. Now, here at least something. We're getting 3 points for every slain human. With the right character, we can go on a killing spree. Add here initial 120 points, no wonder it's the most preferred option.</p><br><p>Also, put aside all that points stuff, being mush is absolutely not rewarding from a social perspective. What do you see in chat while looking at the last words window or in the end game results when mush? The words of approval for the tactics you used? Or maybe gratitudes for making an investigation quite exciting and challenging? Nope. Never you see anything other than "Nicely done!" said to your murderer or any other words of approval said to the human team. At best you can receive something like pity for impossibility to cure you if you were socially active. That's. It.</p><p>Nobody cares that behind the mush is an actual player. The player that is forced to play the main role in this show, actually! The name of the game is "The Mush", after all. But nobody cares one bit. This is understandable, too. But c'mon! Can't we be more sympathetic to those players? It's like virtual racism because of this totally wasted mush-rewarding system, that simply doesn't exist. <br>Those mush players which are trying to play low, undetected, trying to multiply, plotting, and making this game exciting for humans doing it on sheer enthusiasm, nothing more. The game isn't encouraging to play as mush at all! That explains why it almost always ends up in a rampage. We ourselves are forcing the mush to rampage because it's easier to start a new game as a human rather than trying hard to make the game fun for others. What for?</p><p>Remember how boring the game gets after all mush were dealt with? Yep. And now remember how stressful to play as mush. So why should the mush play any differently when there's an option to end this unrewarding nightmare?</p><p>In fact, I think this is literally every online mafia-based games' problem. Being a bad guy isn't rewarding. So we have to endure it and wait for when it's over to try once more in order to actually enjoy the game. Isn't this stupid? Why this can't be solved? Even when it's easy to do. Just let the players receive more coins, points, XP, or any other stuff for playing a bad guy, and that's it. But no. Let's make it miserable and humiliating for these players because they're playing a bad role. Why? Because of being bad is bad, kids? I have no idea.</p>

                <p>I do not play for the glory. I want my team, whether human or mush, to win, not just by default. If Pilgred can't be completed, the human team will probably be dead or pulverised in space with or without mush help.</p><p>Some of my mush rampages seem to be failed affairs. Goodbye block of post-its. Good ones from the Mush perspective take out those techs capable of fixing Pilgred.</p><p>My preferred Mush goal is to reach Eden. Failing that, Neron Assassination for only Mush living aboard the Daedalus, or Sol. Daedalus destruction is OK.</p><p>Human goals, Eden, Sol, or at the very least before ship destruction, all the mush to be killed.</p><p>Mini-wins for the ship as a whole, getting to planets and doing expeditions. Shows organisation, working together. Finding alien plants and artefacts.</p><p>Some ships before becoming full or forced selection have such a lazy crew. They do absolutely nothing. There are hunters attacking but no pilots yet the turrets remain untouched. Cameras get put out first while there are no mush but there are hunters, you want to be filmed being pulverised by the ship blowing up? The plants didn't produce oxygen... Cries of, "But it isn't my job." Ships are slow filling and if someone awakes when the ship is in bad shape, they might not feel enthusiastic as the rest of the crew can't be bothered.</p>

                <p>Depends on person, i LOVE to be mush, this is the most exciting thing in the whole game. Being mush may be very depressing, being always under pressure, suspected and paranoid the next cycle may be the last for you. But it is very rewarding to outsmart 14 people, unable to catch you, while you infect everything around. My theory is that it is psychologically difficult to be the hunted one, which results in easy rampage strategy. To be a good mush you need to know the theory and be confident.<br>Glory points are trash, anyway Roland always wins.</p>

                <p>I try to stealth-infect as much as possible. Perhaps if humans rushed less to do every research on D1 (well, D5 now) Mush would consider more the possibility of bringing them into the light in a humane way. I hate to see "Welcome to the Cause, comrade" as much as anyone, but when it's there you have to do your duty!</p><p>Mush takeovers and contamination wins are still possible.</p><p>With regard to glory and likes, glory is to be ignored. As far as likes are concerned, Mush often die early, and players who die early - human or Mush - tend to be forgotten during the 5-10 day struggle for Sol or Eden.</p>

                <p>The whole idea of Mush is an interesting idea, but it's vastly unbalanced. If mush do well (converting people undetected), they keep doing better with the additional skills and planners, but if any mush dies, the rest of the team is punished heavily with humans getting access to mushvore bacteria+pheromodem, basically ruining the mush's chance of ever converting discretely ever again. Then you have characters with skills that only serve to help humans and screw yourself if you are mush like paranoid/mycologist/caffeine junkie/existing as a Finola(...why can she be an alpha and why does she have germaphobe?). Additionally, the random illnesses immediately confirm humans upon being cured, or humans can simply eat 2 random things in one cycle and are immediately confirmed, along with having more AP that mush can never get since they can't gain anything from food. The 2 alpha mush basically serve to entertain the other 14 untl they die, then RNG takes over as the antagonist.</p><p>I don't enjoy being mush, and I always feel sorry for them</p>

                <p>Thank you for your replies!</p><p>This thread was made to share some game designer's point of view, mostly. 'Cause, you know, our beloved game is doomed now. But maybe some people will bring this unique genre back to live again someday.</p><p>Anyway, as I can see from the replies, that I was right, and mushy side of the game is broken. I said before, that it's all the "mafia" based games' problem. It has to be solved at last.<cite>The whole idea of Mush is an interesting idea, but it's vastly unbalanced. If mush does well (converting people undetected), they keep doing better with the additional skills and planners, but if any mush dies, the rest of the team is punished heavily with humans getting access to mushvore bacteria+pheromodem, basically ruining the mush's chance of ever converting discretely ever again.</cite> - That's says it all. Mush is disbalanced completely. First of all, it has to be rewarded properly, I'd say it should be x3 exp for being the bad guy (as bad guys in such genres are always outnumbered and discouraged all the way through.) The next thing in my opinion should be 2nd-grade reward such as glory points multiplied, too. Everything must encourage to play the bad guy role. As without it, the game would be dull as hell. Unlike mafia, the mush allows multiplying "mafia" members. This should be treated properly as well. As said above, after getting the first mush killed, the human team gets huge bonus, in researches. The last surviving mush must be getting some bonus, too. Such as encouraging to stay low as long as possible at least. For example, this could be x5 to XP or glory, or any other stuff. Giving some extra skills could be the way to go, but it must be balanced, too. It shouldn't be looking weird like powering up for no reason. The humans getting this kind of power-up, but they have the reason, like the body to expertise. But, the mushovore bacteria project is too easy. It must be way, way more difficult to accomplish, I mean mush menace is new and there's no cure or any other stuff against it. But humans are managing to create a sort-of vaccine right away, without all possible lab tests and stuff. This is ridiculous. Making this "vaccine" must be much more difficult, thus giving the other mush time to adapt to being alone, not without any bonuses, which now can be ridiculous, like allowing the mush to create 1 free spore daily for example. This won't break the balance, but allow the mush to stay hidden. For example, they will be able to fake eating, in order to mimic humans, for example. Thus the game should move on without losing tension as it is now.</p>

                <p>I'm not going to disagree with you that there are issues - some with Mush, some with Mafia-type games in general - and some of them are pretty intractable. Maybe some day a better Mush will be made that incorporates all the great things about Mush and fixes some of the problems. (In fact I'm sure of it!)</p><p>Aside from any specific problems, there is the issue of increasing game knowledge and metas growing over time. Role-playing can help (and glory is presumably an attempt, if not altogether a successful one, at encouraging this). Randomness can help, and of course there is some of this - but there could be more. What if random research results appeared after a given amount of research, for example?</p><p>Secret and somewhat randomised objectives with tangible rewards for players (out-of-game rewards such as exp, or in-game rewards such as AP boosts maybe) might help.</p>

                <p>I was recently solo mush Raluca in a ship that started with 3 people still in cryo. I started the game with no AP because I'd been investing in projects and within 2 cycles, ASG and CS were already completed, promptly followed by Alarms within the day and the Mycoscan + Spore Sucker the following day. I'd managed to trap some shelves, got Frieda and Gioele at 1 spore each and Roland at 2 spores after which all possible anti-mush research was finished. In less than 2 full days, all my efforts were killed by the superpower that is Bio-Medic Finola and a bunch of people most likely double eating to confirm themselves. I never had a chance to regain my AP, being Raluca and all, I never had a chance to do much. I was slowly gaining AP and waiting for day change to finish converting Roland but of course he found out he had spores and promptly extracted them with the Spore Sucker.</p><p>The fact that it's a Finola season and that I was without a partner really killed all my chances and, quite frankly, I was so discouraged and disillusioned once I saw all my efforts undone in just 2 little researches that I didn't even care anymore. I had no AP to rampage or do anything else at that point and could only wait for my death which came swiftly after.</p><p>I used to love playing as Mush but now, not so much. Everybody is Gold now, all Finolas are OP and Mushes never get a chance to act because within 1-2 cycles, most research is done and at least 3 people have double eaten.</p>

                <p>For me, being Mush is less frustrating than being human. I can split my human gameplay into active and passive regarding Mush hunting.</p><p>Playing actively, I put top priority into hindering discreet conversions. I make myself aware of every potential sinister activity going on in the ship. My actions and observations of serious suspicion are not revealed in public. Along with this, I'm aware I attract a lot of suspicion as a guy who hides objects, walks with medikit, frequently visits the shower dorm, etc. I share my informations with very few people I trust but I'm afraid the remaining crew might act vigilante and kill me meanwhile.</p><p>Playing passively, I just do my job depending on the character I am, trying to minimize any suspicious activity. I don't visit any side rooms and try to avoid visiting Bravo Dorm for no reason. I gather information only from logs and chat I read while doing my job. I'm afraid of limited knowledge as I'm not sure if suspicious activity is monitored. I'm afraid of Mush ability to kill or fully convert a human and this human might be me. Even when we are supposedly Mush free, I'm not certain if Anonymush is actually stealing our victory.</p><p>As human. I don't follow certain part of metagaming which I consider suboptimal. I usually end up disputing with other people which might question my reliability. As Mush, I try to be reliable whenever possible, acting in a way the majority would like me to see. I try to be fully aware when I act suspicious achieving Mush goal. I'm not afraid of dying because I can't be surprisingly backstabbed.</p><p>Achieving human goals is strongly dependent on the team you have and your decisions are also dependent on them. As Mush, you have much more freedom to what you want to do. You just make a thought and there we go: discreetly converting half of the crew. Maybe non-discreetly, such as watching how the crew bar grows yellow over time. Going to Sol on a whim - only possible for a Mush. Because crew annoys you? Because you want to ruin their dreams of the ship with Plasma Shield, jumpkins and numerous gold projects bought? You can kill certain human that really disgusted you beforehand. This is what you can't do as human because of the remaining crew and SDF rules.</p><p>So summarizing, being Mush is less stressful because you can't be killed undeserved and you are allowed to do more things than as a human.</p>
