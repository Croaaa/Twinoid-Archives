                <p>I played a pretty exciting game not too long ago and I told my girlfriend all about it. She encouraged me share it with others, so I went up a notch and wrote it all in this diary. If you were a member of the 'Kuan Ti/Raluca Multi-Teamster' ship, feel free to leave your comments on anything I might have messed up!</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Day 2 - Weather: It's space. I woke up from cryosleep today and helped Finola get started on some research. It seems that I was the only survivor on Xyloph and that the others have been looking forward to me waking for some time. They called me 'our last hope'.<br><br>Day 3 - Weather: It's still space. The Captain contacted me in private today. He said that I was the only one he could trust and that he would like for me to inform him of suspicious activity. I was humbled that this man entrusted such a duty to me..but I suppose I am the only one that anyone -can- trust. I promised not to let him down. I needed to search the Daedalus, anyway..for the MUSH sample that we acquired never made it to the laboratory. I will make my rounds when Finola lies down for the night.<br>____<br>Hua is dead..I..don't know what to say. According to the reports, she was innocent..just, not..right in the head. But there was so much evidence stacked against her that the Captain..Kuan Ti took it the worst. He stood up to the Captain, but Jin Su held his ground and justified his actions. And somehow I..agree with the Captain. It hurts to know that he killed an innocent woman with his bare hands..but he was right. He had no choice.</span></span></p>

                <p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Day 4 - Weather: Hunter debris.<br>Ian has been sleeping a lot lately..Finola looks like she could use a major break. But we couldn't bring ourselves to wake Ian him and make him feel bad about his sloth..everyone's working hard, but it's difficult to be upset with a guy like Ian. I don't..feel particularly strongly for him or anything, but I just..it's hard to despise him, you know? He's such a sweet and peaceful guy. But Finola really needed the sleep..and so Roland woke him up for us.<br>With a loud, "FALCON PUNCH!", Ian was awake. Thank you, Roland! Now Finola can get some rest!<br>____<br>Paola is dead! Oh Paola..why? She tried so hard to keep everyone's morale up..and all because of Wang Chao, our 'security' expert! The man became a monster! Were it not for the Captain, Roland, and the others..I suppose I should just be thankful to be alive. I feel so uneasy..but with Ian here in the medlab, I sometimes feel like everything will be alright. Like we won't need to keep fighting each other..if only Eleesha could find that sample. Then Finola and I could ensure that this never happens again! Poor Mr. Rinaldo..I wonder how he's taking it..? I wish I could help him..<br>____<br>The Captain recoginized Roland for his contributions. I am very proud of him and I agree with his words! Roland has been an exceptional member of this crew, and I hope he is rewarded for his work when we get home. But..where could the MUSH sample be?<br>____<br>It's no use..I just can't find that MUSH sample anywhere. I suppose I'll go take a rest in the Bravo Dorm for a little while.<br>____<br>I can't believe it! Giole Rinaldo tried to kill me! He punched me twice and, and..those spores! Oh, it was disgusting! I sure hope Kuan Ti and Terence weren't effected by them..but I couldn't stop to check! I had to run! I didn't know what else to do..except flee to the medlab to patch up these wounds. I couldn't just stay there, either! What if he came after me!? Thankfully, Ian was still hanging around in the lab. Surely he'd keep me safe from him.<br>____<br>Gioele is dead..he was one of them. A MUSH. And who else can I thank but Roland, who ended him with a 'SHORYUKEN!'? That man is a hero. What's most disturbing about this..is that Giole was so far gone that he was not phased by Paola's death, his own daughter, at the hands of his compatriot..Wang Chao. <br><br>Day 5 - Weather: Still space. We are beginning to think that Frieda has..bumped her head somewhere. She hasn't been..right in the head ever since she awoke. It's as if she doesn't even understand English anymore. We've entrusted the Bridge to her, but no matter how many times the Captain asked, she simply seemed incapable of telling us which way to go to reach the closest planet. Our oxygen and fuel levels are looking pretty scary..and Ian hasn't been doing his job. I wonder what awaits us down the road..<br>____<br>I-I..I can't believe it! The Captain's dead! Just moments ago, he went to the Bridge to take us the way Frieda said to! H-he..he went alone..the others are resting in the dorms after dealing with Wang Chao and Giole..I have a bad feeling about this. According to my tracker, there is someone in the front alpha turret..it can only be..the Captain's killer. I..the others would want me to stay safe, but I must know! I should be able to..have a premonition, once I see their face. I..am going now.<br>____<br>I..I'm still alive! I don't know how, but..I saw it! I saw an image of Kuan Ti killing our Captain! Oh Jin Su..I'm so sorry! You asked me to keep an eye on him, too..but I was too late! As I roused from my vision, Kuan Ti stared into my eyes with a blank and murderous look on his face. The glance of a killer. I couldn't contain myself..he killed him. Our Captain! And so I roared with anger, slapping, punching, and kicking that dreaded ship designer until I snapped to my senses and ran to the lab as fast as I could! Finola was still resting in the next room, but..thankfully, Ian is still here! I hid inside by Ian's side, praying that Kuan Ti would not come after me. I grabbed ahold of my walkie and screamed the truth. They would listen to me, wouldn't they? After all, everyone trusted me..for I could never be a MUSH.<br>And the first voice I heard..was the hero who took down Wang Chao and Gioele with the Captain. Roland! He came immediately to my rescue! Furthermore, he investigated the Bridge before confronting Kuan Ti. According to his findings..Kuan Ti was not the only killer! He had an accomplice: Raluca! They entered the bridge together and mercilessly killed our Captain!<br>____<br>Kuan Ti is dead..and good riddance. Finola fought him off a little and Roland saved us both. But..according to NERON, Kuan Ti was no MUSH. Why, then, did he kill our Captain..? I know the two didn't get along very well and the Captain did accuse him in front of everyone for his odd behavior, but did Jin Su really deserve to be killed? And why would Raluca help him? And speaking of Raluca..she's still alive, tending to the Alpha Bay as if nothing happened.<br>Roland called for the others to apprehend her; a traitor to this ship. Stephen woke from his sleep and heeded this call..something that I witnessed in person. Even more disturbing..Raluca was no MUSH either.<br><br>Day 6 - Weather: Space debris..from our own ship. Stephen has been assigned the new Commander of the Daedalus. Why him? He's just a cook..surely someone more heroic like Roland would be better suited to lead us?..I suppose that's just personal bias at this point. I decided to stay in the Bravo Dorm for a while to look after Finola and Janice..Janice knows how to put a smile on everyone's face, but I can tell that even she is disturbed by all of the death lately. <br>____<br>Stephen began to make preparations for our expedition below..the Captain would want us to move on. And we must move quickly..our hull is heavily damaged, and NERON reports that those dreaded hunters are approaching once more. With so many people in the Alpha Dorm with Janice, I decided to go take a rest in the Bravo Dorm. Ian..something is strange about him. He looks awfully dirty for a guy who did little to no work on this ship. Especially since we left him that dirty apron to wear!<br>____<br>And now Ian is resting in the Bravo Dorm, next to poor crippled Terence. Terence must have slept through this whole nightmare..of Gioele lashing out at me like that. And now with Ian in there..I just had to go. To make sure Terence would be safe. As soon as Ian gets up, we're going to have a serious talk..with Roland by my side.<br>____<br>Terence woke up not too long ago and pointed out our situation. He had a point..those enemy vessels needed to be dealt. But Roland disagreed, stating that we should get in and out of the planet and jump on our way. I needed a little time to think..to gather my strength for our next course of action.<br>____<br>Oh my god! Ian just..he just woke up, and..shot himself! Why?! Why..I know that..things are looking very dismal right now, but to do something like that!? I just..and on top of that, I just heard that Frieda did the same thing! How could that even happen!? Two more dead..both innocent. Oh god..Ian was innocent! And I told Roland my suspicions, too..is it my fault? That I came so close to condemning him, that my fear and sheer force of will brought this death upon him?<br>____<br>*a few marks of blood are scattered across this page* I..I..failed..everyone was counting on me..trying to protect me..all I had to do..was live for them. I d-don't have much time left..but if anyone finds this..I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I judged Ian so harshly..when in reality, he was protecting me this entire time..oh Ian..you protected me from Kuan Ti, and even from Terence without even realizing it..<br><br>I should have pieced the truth together sooner..Terence was one of them all along..but I looked upon his crippled body and spared him suspicion. I was certain that Giole's nasty spores had infected Kuan Ti, who murdered our Captain..when we found out that Kuan Ti was no MUSH..he was telling the truth when he reported the results of his mycoscan. He may have been a traitor..but he was no liar. Had I just believed him..we would have seen through Terence sooner.<br><br>I..I've lost too much blood..there is no hope for me. And so I leave my last words to you..who I pray, from the bottom of my heart, will be you, Roland..stop Terence. Retrieve the MUSH sample from him..and use my body. Finola can find the cure to this madness..I know she can. Stay strong..you're humanity's last hope now.</span></span></p>

Sadly, as i switched body's with Stephen, i got his glory points (50), instead of 100 glory points i had as Terence, anyway, it was the Best. game. EVER! I't was so fun. there were only 2 humens alive after i died, and they died 2 cycles after me, so we almost won as mush.</p>

I found it funny that I turned away for a few minutes then tried to reply that I'll go to the turret like you suggested, only to find myself dead after attempting to press enter.</cite><p>I didn't laugh after Kuan Ti/Raluca killed Jin Su... I cried (In the game), out of happiness, because till then I lost hope to win as a mush, but then 3 of them died, and Frieda didn't give us the direction so giogle was responsible for getting a planet...</p><p>How about we will find more people and create after the beta one of these private ships that you get no exp in? are there private ships?</p>
