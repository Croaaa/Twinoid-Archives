                <p>It's a thread to discuss what actions you often see on your ships, and you don't like those at all. Discussion how to play around those situations are welcome too.<br>Let's skip the oblivious - there is no need to name grifers, mush surrender or anyone who is breaking SDF rules. As well as idles. There are too many threads about those already.</p><p>1) Humans, who don't care how mushy their actions look like.<br>Forgeting apron, passing unprotected rooms for no reason and so on. If nobody is doing such mistakes on ships, mush options become really limited. But such people a) let mushes do the same and get away with that, killing all such suspects is unacceptable for most ships b) or help real mushes to remain undetected much longer</p><p>2) Humans who just doing their job, ignoring everything else<br>Finding mushes is job for every human. I don't say you should personally check every room as Paola or pilots, but watching logs in rooms you visit and analyzing can help as well. Especially if you just stay in the only shower room. Also some people are not checking other stuff. Hull at 20, hunters are coming, team killed mushes and rushing PILGRED on all ap...better ignore that and contact brainsync base!</p><p>3) Humans, who waits Chun's order to do anything<br>Chun is just another player. You can be more observant, experienced and more active then her. Sure, it's good idea to share your ideas with her, ask for opinion and so on. And if she really can help with investigation, it will nice if she leads it. But if she fails in all that (like you told her name of mush you found and she says nothing in cycles), don't be afraid to act on your own/with other players you trust and explain your actions.</p><p>4) Players, who pick skills before it's clear what skills are needed<br>Astro or Pilot for Frieda, Robotics or Pilot or Tech for Terrence and so on. You can take the skill you just want to take in first seconds or wait a little and see what is really needed. Same for mushes too - people like to take their "best" skills at very start...and be revealed very quickly. Silver lvl 3 Ian mush took Bio+Botanist instead of just Botanist and was either forced to spend all ap in lab or be revealed - great help for him partner! Why so impatience?</p><p>5) "Metaslaves"<br>People who were told/read somewhere how they "should" play. And now they play only that way, ignoring any arguments why in <strong>this</strong> condition stuff they learned is not best. Sofa should be built on bridge, Paola and Frieda should be there is good example. They don't care that there are 4 idles on the bridge and there are no solids/wrestles to move those. All logistics would be wasted - who cares - that should be done!</p>

                <p>First off, I <img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/loc/fr/notes/Plus1.png" alt=":teacher_bobj_1:" class="tid_img tid_parsed" style=""> this thread <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As for the actual discussion ...<br>I think your #4 isn't so bad. It's not <em>good</em> but people like me who do the alternative and wait before choosing are so rare that I think of the two groups as "people playing normally" and "clever people who have put more thinking into the game".</p><p>To a lesser extent, I feel the same about most of your other points too. People doing these things on randoms are so common that I've come to accept them as the norm, and as annoying as they are, I can't do anything about them but try my best to work around. I'd like to add some :</p><ul><li><strong>Mush who don't understand their goals</strong>. (Not mush surrender, mind you ) The winning condition of the mush team is to either prevent humans from returning or to survive to the end as mush. <br> A lot of mush tend to just settle for doing damage randomly and without any direction. Common examples are much who rampage on Chun/Janice, another is taking off in the pasiphae. While attacking morale and scrap <em>do</em> hurt the human team, the effect is not immediate enough to impede them much on their mission unless the human team was extremely weak to begin with. What is does do is prevent humans from enjoying the ship for much longer after doing PILGRED, which is not the goal of the mush team, whom it is still a loss for as if they have done nothing at all. Yet people still do it because they think blindly doing random damage will eventually meet their goals. Somehow.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Arrogance &amp; insolence</strong>. "<em>i've played 100+ ships and my best is D15 so you better listen to me now! if you disagree with me, ur either a mush, n00b, griefer or some combination of those. Your ideas are stupid, stop being a n00b</em>"</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Sore losers</strong>. Mush is a PvP game. Sometimes, you will lose. This is how PvP games work. 8 times out of 10, if the mush win, humans will complain about inactivity. Sometimes, the ship really is inactive but even if it's not, "<em>those people who don't really talk that much are kind of like idlers yeah? I'll just say that there was only 2 active people on the ship in my end page</em>". It's never the fault of the actual player that their ship failed, it's always the fault of everyone else. Or the mush cheated somehow<br>Same goes for the mush team. Either their partner sucks or the humans got lucky. Again, it's everyone's fault but their own</li></ul>

                <p>My last ship landed back at Sol today with mush in charge (I was mush). I may have come across as arrogant to my partner saying that I am an experienced mush, but I apologised. I wanted them to take trapper but no, they didn't want to as you couldn't guarantee who'd get the spore, etc. (We could have had a few players partially infected, would have given us more options). Then, I said, I took phagocyte - a waste of a spore they said (however, in the end, I needed phagocyte after transfer into the commander to have ap to return to Sol)... My partner only needed one spore in the end (but had taken 2 spores), but was able to relay pilgred with my beta mush, and myself once, to complete pilgred and had enough ap for the final spike of the commander.</p>

You can be more observant, experienced and more active then her. Sure, it's good idea to share your ideas with her, ask for opinion and so on. And if she really can help with investigation, it will nice if she leads it. But if she fails in all that (like you told her name of mush you found and she says nothing in cycles), don't be afraid to act on your own/with other players you trust and explain your actions.</cite><p>I remember a game, where I was playing Eleesha.

You can take the skill you just want to take in first seconds or wait a little and see what is really needed. Same for mushes too - people like to take their "best" skills at very start...and be revealed very quickly. Silver lvl 3 Ian mush took Bio+Botanist instead of just Botanist and was either forced to spend all ap in lab or be revealed - great help for him partner! Why so impatience?</cite><p>well, I am just bronze and most characters have 1 main skill, which I would want to select 90% of the time. theres only a few which are more flexible. also I hate staying 'naked' without skills. if i was silver i would probably play more flexible (pick one skill at start and leave the second one open for when I need it)</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8095259 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8095259">Kyubey</span></span><cite>5) "Metaslaves"<br>People who were told/read somewhere how they "should" play. And now they play only that way, ignoring any arguments why in <strong>this</strong> condition stuff they learned is not best.

I don't say you should personally check every room as Paola or pilots, but watching logs in rooms you visit and analyzing can help as well. Especially if you just stay in the only shower room.

                <p>Again someone else that don't understand Paola greatness, She is one of MOST important person on ship. Tell me da you said 8 AP per day. Ok maybe enough for base ((not saying that will make playing as Paola TOTALLY boring)) but what if before base a trader ship pop up? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/sifflote.gif" alt=":-&quot;" class="tid_ico"> Thats 2 AP. Sometimes trader give you one thing like pot then you can sell that pot. So 4 AP. You can't stop unexpect events from happening. So if you lose some AP accidently you know crew should wait for 3 or 4 cycles to get it back as Paola. And in D 5 afterwards that is a lot of time to get hit by so many things <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"> Not saying how important Neron Upgrades may turn out to be. And i always do Xly first and try to complete most of them before starting since all of them are important stuff <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> See? But not just that you know sometimes people gang on Paola to get them books,BPs and other stuff from comms faster. But they just don't know how hard its to play with one AP per cycle. So one way or another this thing make playing as Paola less effective and boring <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>This is amazing. <br>I never would have guessed that understanding you would become harder the less similes you use. Now where is anyone ganging up on Paola? And when did this become a character x is blablabla thread? Don't we have enough of those?</p><p>Anyway, if they were a bit more polite it would probably already do a big difference. Seeing that 'please' would double their active vocabulary. But it's not just the lack of words or the constant use of imperative that bothers me. It's that they are incapable of building the sofa themselves. You can argue about her AP costs all you want - if she just builds it, sleeping on it will compensate her for the cost faster than sitting there for 2 days complaining.</p>

                <p>Ian struggles with 8ap a day on top of botany points. Recently, 2 days running, I was spending 15ap all on gardening - 7 pots, 3 jumpkins needed grafting, so the plants they go onto need watering/treating first, etc... Not one person came to help. Even on c8, on a couple of days, the good fruit (before getting jumpkins) were not being eaten.</p>

You need to give beds to people who's AP is more valuable, and the comms manager's AP is about as a pilot's, even more valuable if there are a lot of pilots.</p><p>Nexus/lab participation nowhere near as important because any Joe can go and push the button. Rebel bases are time sensitive; updates are semi-time sensitive if you want to manage your project builds; xyloph is pretty important as those books/BPs can be a game changer, mush disk and xyloph list are needed fast for mush hunt too</p>

                <p>I have plenty of gripes that are for pub ships and outside of casting. Hrmn, maybe I should cast. Who knows.</p><p>1) Only 4 people being active in a ship. That isn't even fun if the mush win or lose at that point. They say you can win with only 4-5 people, but if the active people aren't tech and your RNG roll doesn't get you a tech book, you're done for PILGRED wise.</p><p>2) People doing constant mistakes not mush/noob. I get if someone's new and they do a bunch of mistakes and what not. This one's really up in the air I suppose. But if someone's snooty about everything and still makes a bunch of mistakes, those are the worst. Especially if they kill important people for not a good reason.</p><p>3) As fort he case of Paola, I get angry when it's day 4-5 and STILL no sofa. I'm angry for the fact that we have 2-3 techs and not one of them tries to dismantle a shower, or a lizaro. Whatever. If we have one tech or no techs, I can't be angry. The inactivity of the crew could factor into it, they have more jobs to do than dismantling. Could also be unlucky. But when multiple people don't get me my sofa? That's what I'm pissed. Even better to add to this, pilots not getting scrap for sofa to be possible. Had that happen too.</p><p>4) Skillless people taking beds when other people with skills can take a bed. I'm not mad if they have at least one skill that makes sense for you to have AP for it, but skilless jin su that only takes leader after mush selection? Yeah, dead giveaway you didn't need that AP or you're a mush. Even better is their reasoning for it. It's always bad. 'I know more than you so I get this bed.' 'They weren't here, even though they're a pilot!' Summarized versions of what I've been given. And since you can't punch them out of it for absorbing AP without a clear direction of where its going, even worse. If you're unsure of your skills before mush selection, at least let the people who could possibly have good skills get a chance at a bed first. You might get your slot after having an inactive sleep on the bed that needs to get punched off.</p><p>5) People complaining about no project, no research, etc. and not helping with it. Better yet, Kuan Ti with project points can't help research because he needs his MP to use only one relay on the project computer then go back to the dorms. Best way to fix this problem is to work with it.</p><p>I have more reasons but not too much a collection. I'm usually a salty person, but I'm trying somewhat to work with my ships. However, most people just snap back at you or ignore you if you want something done :/</p>
