                <p>After playing for a few months, i want to share some thoughts:</p><p>1) There are a lot of characters but not so many skills.

After winning with every possible way you realize that it is not a well developed RPG or whatever kind of game is considered. I think that D2N succeeds at this part as it offers you something better to achieve, survive as long as you can (because you will die <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>3) Mush mission is ???? Ok, the ship is full and you get a message that you have join Mush Secret Agency. And ??? Giving a mission to Mush would be far far more interesting. Something to fight for that gives a Mush winning condition.

Premium days: SHOULD count after selection!!! Joining a ship that needs 3 days to start (that is the most often situation) wastes your premium days.</p><p>And there are a lot of things to be mentioned, but these are a good start.<br>I would be happy to hear your opinion.<br>(sorry for my English but it is not my language <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> )</p>

And unlike other games Mush doesn't use your premium days while you're off ship and buying gold once will even give you permanent silver mode. And that's not even taking into account, that you can also get gold days with MT passes.</p>

                <p>Well...<br>1) the characters are more than just the sum of their skills. If testing their skills is all you do to discover their character then yeah you'll be done soon but they all have different personalities, histories, flaws and strong points. They all have something like a meta-play-style but you aren't limited to play them that way.<br> <br>2) I can't see how you won in every possible way yet. Not well developed? It's pretty decent the way it is. You can't win in D2N - you die today or you die tomorrow. Here we got a possibility to save / doom humanity. How is surviving another day to ultimately be eaten by zombies better than surviving another day in the hopes of saving humanity? Besides, you can do your survival thing in mush too, people just tend to give up and return to Sol before dying.<br> <br>3) They have a mission. Prevent the humans from winning. It's just that in most cases the RNG are doing a better job at it than the mush. If you need goals like the ones you just suggested why not make them yourself? Start a ship as Roland and make it your goal to convince everyone that Hua is your father. Make it your goal to convert Terrence on the next ship you are mush on. See how many people you can convert. Try to infiltration a Sol-returning ship or even Eden. Actually you can start at trying to reach Eden it's not that easy sometimes the RNG just hates you. Anyhow I guess you get the gist of it. The sort of missions you are asking for, given by the game - they would be listed by the community and the humans would be looking out to use those to find you faster.</p><p>4) Ships currently take quite long to fill that wasn't always the case. You get your additional xp anyway and setting mush aside, you do get to use your Skills before selection too. Or are you one of those people that just lie in bed till selection so they have full AP and can complain in what a bad state the ship is by the time the last wakes up? Hmmmm?</p><p>Lastly. Mush is not a single-player. It's a communication based multiplayer. You can't expect people to dance on the table for your amusement but you can get up and dance for yourself and try to get them to join you. It's hard and some people don't have the talent to animated others ( for example: I can only drive them mad whenever I try ) but...<br>The game has an infinite potential, yet each ship is just as splendid as it's crew makes be.</p>

                <p>I only agree with SirTakis that something should be done about the slow filling ships. Finding more players would be the most desirably outcome, but probably also the hardest one to archieve. I think the beginning conditions should be softened (e.g. less hunters before Mush selection, or none at all til day 2, no morale loss til mush selection, etc.). I joined a ship that already had a dead person and we weren't even full! By Day 4 Cycle 1 we were only 10 people remaining of which 3 were inactive.</p><p>And about the Mush Mission, it might be a nice idea as an extra goal. Like humans get extra glory for special actions or events, that could be for Mush, but each ship it's something different. Not sure how to make it work properly, but an idea is an idea <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Completely agree with Chime. Mush is a game where in every ship you can do something new that you never done before. Hell all this time I played the game and still there are characters which I didn't played in depth with.</p><p>Wining a ship as a mush is boring? Well try to win by converting whole crew! I done that like three times. You know how I did it? I was wining in that ship as a mush, and where most of the other mushes would say "Well lets kill everyone its our win" I planned to survive another day to get enough spore to convert people and continue living.</p><p>As a human discovering who is mush is AWESOME! Like once I had a great amount of time on my hand and played as a Chun and fucking hell I knew everyones AP till their last breath! XD Cus I was watching closely and found the mush, that felt great. Other times it was great as well.</p><br><p>As someone who played too many shits for way too long I tell you, every game finally have an end to their story. Yet its you who choose if you want to enjoy it or not. I finished many games and still am playing them, why? Because I enjoy them and they are games that you can do a lot of shits with them. Instead of sitting around blaming the game for not giving you the fun, try to have some fun man <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>
