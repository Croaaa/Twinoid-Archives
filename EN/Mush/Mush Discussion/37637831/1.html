                <p>Honestly, we see no point in continue on... This is a group of players (or multiple characters controlled by the few players). They started the game and took several vital characters: Jin Su, Chao, Eleesha, Terrence, Hua, Ian etc.. Before the mush selection, they already start to jeopardize the ship. This group has a high chance to have mush within them. So after the must selection, they start to convert everyone into mush, so the mush group can win...</p><p>Right now, Jin Su is counting the number of their group publicly in the game. The number is 8 now, although the game only indicates 2 mushes.</p><p>Also, we lost all rations, freezer, Pasiphae, extinguishers, hacker's kit, mush sample, apron, and weapons to the hands of the group... What's the point of playing along? Especially when we have gold players among us.. Totally a waste of efforts.</p>

                <p>Bofeng, I know that feeling as well. I sort of hate the no suicide rule right now because my ship has almost not active players, we have no rations on day 2 because of griefing, and there's absolutely no hope. I'm currently on gold days, and it's pretty terrible because of that. This sort of thing makes me not want to buy any more gold days, since I pretty much have to just sit on this ship now and wait for my inevitable death from starvation.</p><p>I've basically paid MT so that I can have several days with no chance at fun, all because of griefing.</p>

                <p>Well, be sure to report all who are or even just seem involved. Lets make sure that our mods and judges are fully aware of the full evidence chain of all problems of this sort.</p><p>If you have 8 or some large number of people griefing/acting out as mush on your ship, a totally feasible answer is to try and kill them, one after the other. This might spur them to attack you in turn; that might cause you to die, and if so you'll be released from your unpleasant experience in a way which does not involve any sort of inappropriate play on your part. If they don't attempt to kill you and the others who attack them, then they will start to die.</p><p>If they're off ship, hack and move the ship. If one of them has the hacker kit, attack that one to get it. If they guard that one, attack whomever you must to get to the kit, or whatever. It's a highly imperfect, unpleasant situation, however that's the best advice I can think of; make a PM, coordinate with those not obviously acting like mush or griefer, attack coordinatedly with whatever you do have; chances are high you'll soon be dead and not in a way which comes from inappropriate play on your part. Your hands stay clean, and you're free soon.</p><p>And report your head off. Every single questionable person, or outright obvious rulebreaker. Assist the SDF in understanding the exact problem they face, so they can actually take appropriate action, whatever that is.</p><p>That's really the best we can do, and it should work. Not for this ship, but for the future ones. Good luck.</p>

                <p>This is tough.</p><p>On one hand we have players, some of them paying players, who are upset and aggravated, both by the griefers on their ship (whom the SDF cannot directly control - indirect control through sanctions after time passes, but 100% gaurentee not during this ship's lifetime), and then on the other hand we have judges and mods who have most likely made some sort of deep promise as to the rules they will hold -all- players to. After all, accepting that you are to enforce the rule 'suicide is never allowed' means... well, suicide is never allowed, period.</p><p>The balance point, for the non-griefing players, is to treat it as if it were 'real'. We play Mush, we take the role of someone dedicated to winning despite the nearly impossible odds facing our characters; we thrive despite adversity and we <em>never give up</em>. That's a pretty useful core value; that's one of the centralmost concepts of the game, and it will hold each of us in great stead to cultivate within us. When the times get tough... well they have in the game described here. Monstrously tough, more unfair than ever - and this ship will never get any outside help, ever.</p><p>So do what you can. Teambuild, you who are among the non-griefers. Fight the griefers , knowing that will almost certainly speed your deaths - which you don't mind. But fight them. Don't give up. Give them total war to the extent the programming permits. Do not surrender in any way, but don't flinch from tactics that might kill you too.</p><p>One day you may be homeless and jobless. One day you or a loved one might have cancer. One day you may be on a plane that's being hijacked. One day you might be the only person in a position to be strong and try to save the situation, or you can just fold and collapse and let whatever happens happen. This game is about being strong, and finding a way until it is -impossible- for you to keep trying to find a way.</p><br><br><p>SDF folks. Try to remember that it's demotivating, for most people, to feel like they are put into a situation with only bad choices. If you feel the need to tell us what not to do, lest we face punishment - do so, of course. But don't 'just' do that. What should a player in this situation do? What -may- a player in this situation do? In addition to the 'do not, or else' answer, consider providing positive guidance as well. Remember there's quality non-griefers behind some of our usernames, and ideally correction tell us not only what -not- to do, but what -to- do as well.</p>

                <p>I recognize that the rules are in place for a reason, but when you have a ship with no rations and maybe 5 players that log in around once a day (and the rest are inactive), the game stops being fun. You're stuck there, practically alone, knowing that nothing you do will prevent your eventual death from starvation or depression.</p><p>It seems like a huge flaw, one that is bad for business as well. My ship had a few new players who will definitely not be continuing (which means no chance of them buying gold), and I'm probably just angry right now because I'm stuck paying for four to five days of pointlessness, but if this keeps being an issue, I don't know that I see myself buying more gold.</p>

                <p>I've dealt with more than my share of murderships ruined by griefers, and like many of you, I also pay for Gold. Is it frustrating when a game is ruined through no fault of my own? Hell yes, it sucks, and I've never once suggested otherwise. It's my opinion that if the game were on a pay to play model, we'd probably have fewer griefers, since they usually wouldn't want to risk losing a paid account; but we'd probably have fewer players, overall. I don't know if that would even be financially viable for MT, but that's a topic for another discussion thread.</p><p>My default position in griefed ships has always been to keep pressing on as long as we can, finish Pilgred if possible, and then get back to Sol, if at all possible. Failing that, survive against the odds, and do whatever is necessary to keep advancing until both of the above conditions have been met. What do you do if you've been griefed that badly? Whatever you can to survive and get back to Sol, provided you don't commit Pathetic Suicide, don't surrender, and don't break any other rules in the process. That leaves a lot of leeway in what you can do. But if you bail while others want to keep fighting, you're letting the griefers win by default.</p><p>I acknowledge that griefers will always be present to ruin games, and we all know they don't care who gets affected in the process. At the same time, ALL players have to be held to the same standard by the SDF, and two wrongs don't make a right. This is the crux of the SDF position.</p><p>People who have had grenades or the microwave used as part of griefing attempts may want to hide these items before Mush selection, but it's sanctionable to do this. While it might be an <em>understandable</em> course of action...it's also something that we've sanctioned those people for doing. Their <strong>intent</strong> may have been to <em>prevent</em> griefing, but we still have to sanction them the same as a griefer who hides the Hacker Kit, Apron, or the other weapons before Mush selection.</p><p>The SDF does everything it can within its power to sanction griefers, and to keep them off your future ships. It's also an uphill battle for us at times, because when non-griefing players have their ships ruined, and they end up breaking the rules as a result, the SDF is still obligated to do the jobs we were assigned. It again comes down to two wrongs not making a right. Pathetic Suicide is sanctionable. Dying while in the course of advancing your team's goals is not. So, if you die because you spent your last AP killing the last Arack, and your sacrifice allows the ship to jump and keep going, it's <strong>not</strong> a Pathetic Suicide. (Granted, that's a rather extreme example, but a plausible one.)</p><p>In contrast, dying <strong>just because you want to get off the ship</strong> is what generally ends up being considered a Pathetic Suicide. So, if someone goes out in a patrol ship, doesn't fire at the Hunters, stays out there for a day, and is shown to be human after they die? They may not have <strong>intended</strong> to grief the ship, but it's still a Pathetic Suicide. Picking up and dropping the cat repeatedly is the easiest way to earn a sanction for Pathetic Suicide, and there is no wiggle room to justify doing that under the rules. Surrender and suicide were forbidden long before the SDF was created, and we can't make exceptions to this, not for ourselves, and not for anyone else.</p><p>If we excuse people who commit suicide because of griefing, then we're also going to have to make exceptions for people who kill themselves because they think there's "no chance to get to Eden", and commit suicide because of that. We'd have to make exceptions for people who committed suicide after all their rations were cooked, even if the rest of the crew managed to rally together and save them all. We'd have to make exceptions for every crew that had Mush steal the Pasiphae and/or the Icarus, and they subsequently want to give up. Ultimately, it then becomes a slippery slope in which players will want us to keep moving the goalposts.</p><p>"Why make an exception in this case, and not others?"</p><p>At that point, we'll be spending more time redefining what the rules are, rather than spending our efforts enforcing them. I hate griefing with a passion, and many of you already know just how hardline I am about griefing cases. At the same time, all players still have to be held to the same standard. Having your ship griefed doesn't make your own Pathetic Suicide suddenly acceptable...because if others want to press on, despite the odds, than you would be further ruining their chances of accomplishing that. The same goes for any rules being broken to "preemptively deal with griefing", such as hiding the Hacker Kit or weapons before Mush selection. We can't allow that, either.</p>

                <p>I think we must ask, why are so many player Griefers today?<br>Often a griefer does really know, what he/she must do exactly to sabotage a ship, like killing Chun, take the cat and important things and flee with parsiphae etc...so one griefer can ruin a ship,ruining circa another 7 days until you can start a new ship.</p><p>Eventually the game concept creates griefer?<br>Eventually forbidding suicide will produce agressive individuals?<br>Do players will accept any rules from an autocrat?

I think No!</p><p>Imho i dont think Reports will bring any help.</p></cite><p>People grief because they are under the impression that they can get away with it. They don't care who they harm in the process. Yet you assert that reports won't "bring any help". To be blunt, you honestly have no idea just how many reports we go through every day, and just how many griefers we have quarantined. We're far more effective at our jobs than you might be led to believe.</p><p>MT wrote the rules on suicide and surrender long before the SDF was formed. We have to uphold those rules, because if we don't, people WILL give up and bail on their ships, even while not <em>intending</em> to grief. They will do this for any number of reasons, if they are allowed to do so without consequences. Yet the damage to that ship is still done, and it makes the chances of a successful human victory after that point even smaller.</p><p>Would you be happy with it if you wanted to get to Eden for the first time, and you already had two of the Map pieces, but 3-4 of the crew decided they were bored, and killed themselves to get on another ship? More importantly, do you believe those players should be allowed to commit suicide <em>without any negative consequences</em> being enforced upon them?</p><p><strong>Every player must be held to the same standard</strong>. Griefing is unacceptable, but so are surrender and suicide. It's unacceptable for <strong>human</strong> players to cook all the rations, steal some items, and fly off in the Pasiphae. It's not griefing if a Mush does it. But, what you're also suggesting is that reporting doesn't help. Let me assure you, <strong>IT DOES.</strong> Ask anyone who has seen a griefer get quarantined before they could do any serious damage to their current ship. Sure, you could <em>choose</em> to not report anyone for ruining your games, but if they don't get reported, they don't get punished. <strong>It's that simple</strong>.</p><p>Your post suggests that the rules (and by extension, the SDF) are the <strong>cause</strong> of griefing. This is the logical equivalent of blaming the police because your house was burned down, instead of blaming the actions of the arsonist who committed the crime. We can't punish someone for crimes they have not yet committed, after all.</p>

But the rules do not explain why this was so decided.</cite><p>Do I really have to explain why <strong>surrender</strong> is forbidden, despite the fact that it's in <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/help?cat=general&amp;scat=rule">the</a> <a target="_self" href="/tid/forum#!view/104909|thread/31784554">rules</a>? Alright, I will. If the Mush surrender, they deny the human team the challenge of the Mush hunt. If humans surrender, they hand the Mush an easy victory. As a PvP game, both teams deserve a worthy opponent; not one that will give up the moment things seem grim. Suicide also falls under the no surrender rule, as do Harmful Returns to Sol by human players.</p><p>For both teams, playing against one's team is explicitly forbidden. Griefing actions fall under this rule, obviously, as does human players killing other humans without any evidence. That wastes AP, causes a morale decrease, and when an active player is killed, everything they could have contributed to the ship is lost. Mush can't reveal who the other Mush are, nor may they ask to be cured. They also can't ask to be killed, "just because they don't like playing Mush." (Of course, that's explicitly treated as a surrender.)</p><p>So why do these rules exist? Ultimately, it comes down to this: <strong>Games must be played to their natural conclusion</strong>. If one team gives up or plays against their team, they deprive the other team of <strong>earning</strong> a victory, just as surely as a chess match in which one player removes every piece on their side except for their king. The victory for their opponent is all but <strong>guaranteed</strong>, but it sure as hell isn't <strong>earned</strong>. Griefing can also deprive <em>both</em> teams of an earned victory; as I've said on more than one occasion, "If griefers deal more damage to the humans than the Mush team, it doesn't FEEL like a win for the Mush team."</p>

                <p>Surrender is for chumps and you're not much better then any other griefer. So instead of one jerk trolling the ship, I get a second person wanting to suicide out because it got two difficult for them.</p><p>Saving your gold days is a crappy excuse. I have gold days and I want to play. If you suicide you just short changed my game play all that much more.</p><p>Where does it stop? Where do you draw the line in the sand on where the ship has all but gone down the tiolet? Everyone is going to have a different line in the sand.
