                <p>Research, projects, Neron upgrades, etc. are not "success chances," or "odds" as you call it. Those are more like "progress rate." So no bonuses from Expert for these. It's same as with Eleesha's Polymath, which doesn't give -10% to progress rate on research, for example, but only for things like repairs, hacking, shooting from things or attempts to find a new planet.</p><p>And it's giving 20% boost, which basically means that all odds are multiplied by 1.2. Reportedly, the same is true for chances of getting dirty or injured from actions that have some chances of making you dirty or injured - chances for those are multiplied by 1.2.<br>So with apron, the chance should be still zero (0 x 1.2 is still 0). Gloves will multiply the base chance of getting hurt by repair by 0.2 and then it will be multiplied by 1.2 by Expert (getting it to 0.24 of base chance of getting injured).</p><p>I don't believe there's any effect on expedition, as the skill never states it anywhere.</p>

Pilot 2. Devotion 3. Polyvalent 4. Confident 5. Expert. <br>With Pilot and Polyvalent being the strongest choices in most cases. Confident is considerable, if the ship lacks a competent morale sources and Devotion as AP boosting skill is a possibility for Comms Manager Andie. Expert on its own is pretty much the worst choice as it's a skill, that would mainly rely on the combination with other chance-based skills like Pilot or Tech(and the Tech book is usually not accessible - especially to Andie).</p><p>Therefore Expert is no option for Bronze players.</p><p>Silver has the possibility of Pilot/Expert, which, but there are usually several better choices like Polivalent/Pilot(just taking the 2 arguably strongest skills), Polivalent/Devotion or Pilot/Devotion(to be a pure AP- boosted researcher/pilot), Confident/Pilot or Confident/Polyvalent(to make up for missing Shrinks/Leaders and Mush hunt).</p><p>Gold should take Pilot and Polyvalent in any case. The remaining 2 slots can be filled with any of the other 3 according to the needs of the ship.</p><p>Since Pilot/Expert is the only sensible combo for Expert, it's enough to only look at it. Giving 20%(<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico">96%) bonus basically replaces the lenses. This is obviously only useful, if you have no lenses or want to take other items into space(usually consumables). Also the bonus to firefighting and repairs is quite nice, if the need arises.</p><p>But wait, there's more! For Mush Andie Expert would be great. Ok, provided choosing it over Polyvalent, Pilot or other skills doesn't make you overly suspicious. <br>Additionally it can put more pressure on the rest of the crew as they have to use their AP to fight hunters(sometimes from turrets) and not having Polyvalent slows down research immensely. Hull and research are usually things you don't want as a Mush. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>As the chances for dirtyness and injuries are increased so are the excuses for them. On top of that it's one of the best skills for a rampage - increasing Blaster accuracy to 60% and kick off accuracy to 72%(of course same advantage goes for humans as well, but I imagine Mush rampage is more of a thing).</p>
