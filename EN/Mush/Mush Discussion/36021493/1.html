                <p>Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that this is <strong>my opinion,</strong> and that I have a bad habit of being a touch, shall we say, <em>hostile</em> in my arguing. There may be swears. There may be insults, subtle or otherwise. Just remember that I'm <em>trying</em> to hold back, and that I've warned you from reading further if you're easily offended and are someone of the authority that can deal out bans. Without further adieu, <em>let's dance motherfuckers!</em></p><p>Inactivity isn't much of a secret as being nothing short of a vile, despicable <em>plague</em> in Mush. Nothing kills games faster than a chunk of critical players being inactive since the first minutes, and it's always been something that appears ever-so circumventable. Worse yet, with Mush being such an incredibly slow game, being trapped on an already dead ship is only made worse by how millitantly the rules are enforced about suicide to escape such situations, even though it's the only way to get into another game. Inactivity not only kills ships, but wastes sometimes upwards of days of a player's time. It's <em>awful</em>.</p><p>Then there are proposed 'cures' to the plague. 'Tutorial Ships' and other such novel concepts have been pitched countless times to the developers at Motion Twin, all to no avail. Why? Repeatedly, the developers have gone on the record as saying that they're <strong>strictly opposed to the idea,</strong> saying that it would <strong>never be implemented.</strong> This worries me. While they may have decent motives, such as fearing that it would segregate the player-base, I don't think that would be the case, and even if it <em>was</em>, it would be a small price to pay for the over-all benefit of the community, game, and everyone involved.</p><p>In fact, the whole idea that such ideas would somehow 'segregate' players it utterly preposterous, as merely having the Tutorial exist as it's own isolated 'bubble' for the Tutorial's duration, it would almost entirely eliminate inactive players since nearly every single inactive I've ever seen has gone inactive <em>during</em> the Tutorial. It would be a win-win for everyone!</p><p>If nothing else, Motion Twin, please. At least <strong>start</strong> listening to <em>some</em> of these ideas. Your players would <em>love you</em> for it. Thank you.</p>

                <p>I have no idea what actually happened, but here's my totally unreasonable guess anyways. They made the "tutorial ship" into a totally normal ship, and just crammed it full of newbies. Obviously half of them were inactive and the other half had no idea what to do and were stuck on that ship for days. That would make anyone quit.</p><p>The reason I think that's what they did is because it's the easiest "solution" to making a tutorial ship requiring no effort what so ever. Sorry if you feel like I'm being cynical, but the line between cynicism and realism is paper-thin. Would love to hear that I'm totally wrong though.</p><p>The reasonable way to make a tutorial ship would be to:<br>1. Make the players know that they are on a special tutorial ship<br>2. Make the ship in question last only one day (and make sure to inform the players that normally ships last much longer)<br>3. Have the ship provide interesting pre-scripted events that happen on real ships (but don't happen on the first day) such as battling the mush, going on an expedition, completing research and projects fast, fighting hunters and collecting scrap, building items et cetera. The game should give people pop-ups for objectives to take part in these events.</p><p>Sure, that would require some effort on the part of the devs and I'd be surprised if they cared enough to implement something like that - the actual short-term increase in revenue from implementing that would probably be hard to even notice. Not saying that I can read the devs minds, but reading minds of investors and investor-centric managers is easy.</p><p>Also, why is there no magic 8-ball in the RP-gadgets? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Games can always be improved, so I hope the development team considers some of these changes. A really interesting game mechanic would be to introduce electrical power. This is a spaceship after all. If a room has a camera, it's pretty much safe right now. But if mush could choose to sabotage an electrical relay for a part of the ship, they could temporarily disable the cameras, work stations, etc. in a given area. That would make it possible to obfuscate the room logs and would keep the human players even more on their toes as they are truly not safe anywhere. Power settings could be controlled in the bios, with a choice to redirect power to parts of the ship to give an efficiency boost to console related activities in parts of the ship as well. This would benefit the humans as well! I think it's a really basic concept such as oxygen and fuel that every spaceship needs, but has been overlooked for now. It would be great to put this in and add to the realism and game options in my opinion! Let me know what you all think!</p><p>It would also help offset the loss of players or inactives. I'm playing a game where we got rid of mushy Paola and Frieda is afk. So it's amazingly hard to keep up with those duties. Power boosts would I think also alleviate your biggest complaint, that of inactives on ships without going against what the developers want for the game. It would allow ships to get past the losses of vital crewmembers, although it wouldn't completely make up for it. And it gives the mush more options as well so it's not heavy handed. Plus, I just want to see the lights go out like in horror movies so they can flicker back on revealing a dead crew member and ramp up the suspense!</p><p>I was thinking the power substations could also be used to send a power surge that will overload the circuits, possibly causing fires along the electrical lines path. There are endless options for it! Nexus projects that better regulate energy efficiency, a dampener that would prevent harmful power surges. You could introduce the concept of energy use, for example plasma shields would eat up a lot of energy, dismantler none. One of the characters who don't have 6 levels of skills could have a new skill, Electrician.</p><p>Also it's the most constructive way I've heard of so far to bridge the gap between the developers vision and the thing players hate most about the game, inactives.</p>

                <p>IMO, it would already help to have new players run around a ship doing all the normal tutorial stuff, without any other players. Only if they complete it and pick up their walkies they're put on a normal ship if they still want to. It'd take just a few minutes. It wouldn't keep out all inactives, but at least those that just want to have a look at the game but don't feel like commiting to several days of gameplay.</p>

                <p>Tutorial ships should be played with only one real player, if they were ever implemented. Yes, it takes away the social aspect, but the problem is, otherwise you put potential future players in a ship that is full of inactives, without anyone with experience to help them at all. That's a recipe for disaster. I would not have played beyond my first game if experienced players had not been there to help.</p>

                <p>Tutorial Ships are a winner of an idea. Just because it failed once, doesn't mean that we should call it quits on the idea forever. It just means it needs work.</p><p>My idea is, again, to have Tutorial Ships exist separately from regular ships. Throwing newbies into official ships just so that they could immediately leave is an awful idea, as practice has shown us, so we need to have somewhere for the newbies to play around in until they feel ready to go. So a simple solution would be to have two different type of ships.</p><p>We'd have the lot of official ships going on, and the ships that the newbies play on, which would be selected differently. Think of it as having two buttons right after the 'play' screen, one leading to tutorial ships, and the other leading to official ships, with official ships being locked off to new players until they've had at least one round on a tutorial ship, but experienced players still having the option to join and help the new players learn if they were so inclined. This would promote 'mingling', as the developers referred to it as.</p><p>Tutorial Ships would be quite different, though. Instead of spanning upwards of 5-15 days (varying drastically on how bad the ship has inactivitis), these ships would only last a day until they automatically reset. On these ships, there would also be no limit on how much AP/MP you had, but with a reminder on the first time that you use it all up that this isn't the case in the full game, along with a short synopsis on MP/AP.</p><p>See? With some buffering, all this and more could be achieved if we just worked at fixing the problem!</p>

                <p>There are solutions to the problem. The only thing that is truly irreplaceable is the Pasiphae. All the essential skills have magebooks, there's a third shower, there's multiple extinguisher blueprints (not to mention the automatic extinguisher project), expeditions can be made unnecessary (though still helpful) by oxygenated ducts + extra hydropots, hacker kit replaces both neron admin and commander, and more than I can't think of. The problem has been steadily getting smaller, from everything I've heard. It's perfectly possible to survive 10 days with a few, yet VERY dedicated people who know the game well.</p>

                <p>There's basically two problems here:</p><p>1) Someone tries the game, gets bored and never comes back<br>2) someone tries the game and simply for whatever reason doesn't like it</p><p>There's a few things that can be done to impact both of these issues</p><p><strong>Bronze Character Limitations</strong><br>Sadly, a few of the characters are not particularly enjoyable for a Bronze player, you click to play the game for the first time and select <strong>Roland</strong>, because it says he's a hot-shot pilot with mad skills. You jump into the ship and you have <em>Sprinter</em>, you immediately find there is nothing useful you can do bar moving equipment around the ship, which whilst an experienced crew will honestly appreciate, isn't the most engaging and fun play, there are several other characters with similar issues</p><p><strong>Generalist Characters</strong><br>Similar to the Bronze heroes, if you jump onboard as Gioele, Stephen and to some extent Chao/Eleesha, what you're meant to do isn't immediately apparent, which can lead to quick boredom and abandonment</p><p><strong>For the poor crew left aboard</strong><br>Now the remaining crew have a few issues:</p><p>1) The ship can find itself without any/few Pilots/Technicians, many ships I've been on have struggled significantly because there was no technicians and on one ship I was Jin Su, the only pilot</p><p>2) Inactive characters can directly harm the crew, Noob Jin Su who ran around the ship and left himself standing in Alpha Bay, the crew can't move the ship for 2 days without wasting a ton of AP hacking the command, Noob eleesha means you never get the list, Noob Finola means your research is hugely delayed, noom Chun outside the lab hinders research</p><p>3) Inactive characters can benefit the mush hugely, if you have two active mush and an afk Chao standing in a turret, turn him, anonymush, let the crew kill him and bam you're hidden.</p><p><strong>Solutions</strong><br>Solving all these issues isn't easy. Trial ships for example don't solve all the problems, they also would indeed mean less people would get drawn into the game, as a ship full of level1 characters who don't know what to do isn't going to be a massively fun experience for anyone.</p><p>Here's a few simple gameplay suggestions</p><p><strong>Inactive regen bonus</strong><br>For every character that's gone inactive, another random a ctive player onboard receives 1ap/1mp each cycle, to counter the loss of team AP/MP (the game should be balanced for 14 active crew with 7-9 in beds on every cycle change, so this won't imbalance things</p><p><strong>Shove/Drag action</strong><br>Allow players to shove/push players into other rooms, let the crew push Chun into the lab, shove AFK Gioele from the Bravo Bay into the dorm or push Raluca out of it.</p><p><strong>Mage Book Drops</strong><br>Say your Roland goes AFK on day one and dies of starvation, has him drop a pilot mage book when he dies, or Physisist book when Raluca commits suicide in the lab on Day 2. allow the crew to compensate for the lost specialisation, one specific core skill for each character, only dropped when their inactive (so an active suicided Raluca won't drop a book).</p><p>These idea's can work within the current mechanics, without the need for segregation.</p>

                <p>Players are implementing their own fixes for inactive players. MMM and Mushday. This is prbably hurting the game far more than any fixes the devs might make. We are essentially trying to check out of n00b ships altogether because they are so horrible. If they really want us teaching and helping new players, they have to give us some incentive. Like shunting inactives out so we can have active new players to teach.</p><p>I'm at a point where I will only play casting or MMM type ships. It's too bad, because I like training new players. But it's just too painful wasting my time on ghost ships.</p><p>And yes, the community will keep complaining about this problem even though the devs have stated repeatedly they don't intend to do anything about it. If something sucks as bad as this, you bitch and moan endlessly.</p>

                <p>I've had 6 ships so far. 2 of them had a bit less then half of the crew inactive, so they were total disasters (I got to be a mush on the other one so it was kind of fun), 1 was MMM, 2 are mushday ships and one was a good random ship. So out of my random ships 2 have been basically horrible and one was good - though on that both mush were totally inactive...</p><p>And besides tutorial ships, there are a bunch of even easier though less good ways of handling inactives, like having people "possess" their bodies when they jump, or even making starving much faster would help a lot - or make killing people who have been inactive for a day easy and non-punishable. Unfortunately I'm fairly apathetic to the prospect of the devs even reading these threads, let alone implementing any suggestions.</p>

                <p>In fact, for me much more annoying then inactives are people, who are active at first and then when they see that there's not so much activity as they want just give up and stop being active. And some even make lots of comments about how the ship is bad in the meantime. That's downright demoralizing for us who at least try to be active and hold semiactive ship together.</p>

                <p>That reminds me of the ship I am currently on.. I'm the sole survivor with 3 oxygen in the tanks, not much long till I part. Basically my story goes like this: Theres a dirty person, somebody kills them, that person gets sick, then somebody kills them, then that person got sick, yet another person killed them, and it repeated until it was down to 5 crew. I have no flipping idea how bad things went on that ship.. I hope there is a last man standing achievement or something.. And all the while, despite all the chaos that ensued, the remaining mush was an inactive person..

I will say this again, <strong><em>inactives and new comers aren't a problem that needs fixing it is an intended mechanism you as players are meant to deal with on your ship</em></strong>. There will be no segregation of players into tutorial ships, this is separating the player base and Motion Twin is against it. So, basically, <strong><em>there is nothing we're passing on the developers regarding this subject</em></strong>.</cite><p>Honestly, the admins should just lock these threads as soon as they pop up since apparently people get these delusions that something might be done. Sure, that would get them some misdirected hate from the community, but that's just the way the cookie crumbles for admins. I enjoy discussing this stuff, but now people will probably just get angry and frustrated because they got their hopes up.</p>

Sure, that would get them some misdirected hate from the community, but that's just the way the cookie crumbles for admins. I enjoy discussing this stuff, but now people will probably just get angry and frustrated because they got their hopes up.</cite><p>Some clarification needs to be said. 'Intended' is not in the sense the admins want this (in fact, they have said they are willing to hear actual solutions, not just what looks good on paper), but that it's something that has to be dealt with. The admins have already made the game in some ways so that you can do well without needing everyone involved. For example, the number of waves of hunters you get the first few days depends on how active the ship is. The game is already designed so that you can afford to lose two or so crewmembers (i.e. Mush) and still get a lot accomplished.</p>

You also can't be certain if they had connection issues, and then there's the instant morale loss to contend with. Cathartic or not, it's still a drain on AP that can be spent elsewhere, and it can very easily cause more harm in the long term.

If enough time passes that they should have starved to death, or if you have other reasons to believe they might be Mush, go ahead and make your case to the crew before killing them. Otherwise, <strong>you are contributing to the problem.</strong></p><p>Look at it this way: If you were a new player, and didn't know how Logistics worked, would you rather that someone explained <em>why</em> you shouldn't go inactive on the Bridge, or would you rather that you just get killed without explanation a few cycles after going offline there? The latter case happened to the Roland on <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2403">one of my murderships.</a> It was his first game, and the Eleesha player didn't even give him a chance to have a shower, much less get the inactive status. He got dirty with six people still in cryo, and was killed barely two cycles after Mush selection! As you can see from his profile...that was his only game.</p><p>For all the valid complaints I see about inactive players, there's <strong>also</strong> the players who drive the newbies away from the game with asinine actions like these. Not saying that <em>you</em> go that far, but you have to admit it doesn't leave a positive impression, either.</p>

Some people get really, <strong>really</strong> angry at griefers, trolls and other internet idiots - I personally think they can add a lot of flavour. Sure, it can be the flavour of battery acid mixed with poop, but it doesn't have to be. Though I suppose I used the term griefer a bit loosely.

Also if they say anything whatsoever in the chat besides "Hello", that's a sign they might be active at some point as well even if they take a long break after the tutorial. I've even spent AP keeping an inactive player alive while he was starving, because I hoped they would come back - and they did.</p><br><p>Aaaanyways, all this talk is a bit off topic. Killing inactives would not be very good solution to the problem itself discussed in this thread, even if was allowed in the rules. Also it's against the rules. And allowing for killing inactives even with strict criteria would be too open to abuse, so whatever.</p>

                <p>The Roland I mentioned, the one from my Murdership? He was killed just hours after the game started, under the "excuse" of Mush Hunting. Four others were killed on the first day, including Eleesha. If you didn't read my last words from that ship, That Eleesha was directly responsible for the deaths of <strong>three</strong> people on the first day, and not one of them were Mush. But she was Mush hunting, so according to some people, those are supposedly acceptable losses. We didn't have the link active until Day 3, and by then 10 people were dead from violence or morale loss. <strong>Five</strong> of those committed suicide in a single cycle, and none among the dead were Mush. Morale loss was what doomed us in the end, all stemming from those initial murders.</p><p>Hands down, it was my worst ship, and I was on the ship that had every ration in the Refectory simply vanish due to a bug on day 2.

                <p>Killing them <em>only</em> because they go inactive is what we're trying to prevent, because that spreads out the inevitable morale loss when they die. It also gives less incentive for...shall we say "overzealous" Mush hunters to grief their ships (a.k.a. the "Mush like to pretend to be inactive, so I'm just killing the inactives" defense.) It's the same reason killing someone <em>just</em> for being dirty can be reported. You need something a bit more concrete than that, or it may look like an attempt to grief the ship. Even if the intention isn't to grief the ship, the damage is still done.</p><p>Hell, I once saw a human get killed by another human player, because the victim borrowed the Apron. She was Comms Officer, and needed to eat a banana and a ration, and we told her to use the Apron. Another player who didn't care much for reading the chat killed one of our most active players, under the excuse that the Apron was taken from the Lab. Never mind the fact that she proved herself to be human, never mind the fact that she did it because we asked her to do so. No, she was killed because "she took the Apron, so she HAD to be Mush."</p><p><strong>This</strong> is the sort of behavior and weak justification that we don't want to let slide. It's too easily used to justify griefing, and that's why you need more evidence.</p><p>If their inactivity is causing an interference with ship operations (say, Paola's Logistics) that can constitute justification. See, their harm has gone beyond just being inactive at that point; now their inactivity is actually slowing down the ship operations.</p><p>Likewise, if they are a title holder, and repeatedly come back to take the title from someone who is actually doing their job, that is an acceptable kill.</p><p>And yes, if they're inactive past the point where they should have starved to death, you can help them along. But it shouldn't be your first option!</p>

                <p>I was on a ship where everyone but 2 players were active. Eleesha and Chao were among the active, and they took their jobs as mush hunters seriously and professionally. Over several days they gathered mountains of suspicious evidence on various players, almost every possible type of mush like activity that can happen on a ship - save the 100% certain mush acts like spiking in a camera room or transforming. People getting dirty and not reporting or talking. People taking the apron and going to some far off corner of the ship to sit in a turret. People taking off in a ship, not firing a single shot, and landing over and over again. People ruining neron project progress on bad projects no one wanted. Once they had too much evidence on hand to simply ignore, and the crew was chomping at the bit wanting action to be taken, the noble mush hunters started taking out people in order of descending suspicion. One by one, they died, and turned out human. Over half the ship was killed this way, all human.</p><p>I'm sure you can anticipate where this story is going.</p><p>Turns out, the two inactive people on the ship were mush. A lot of the active human players were just new and made a lot of mistakes. Had we just killed the inactive players first, all humans would have been saved. This end was not the result of an overzealous hunt, or acting on weak evidence. Idle players are either 1) Active mush pretending to be idle, and should be killed. 2) Inactive mush actually being idle, and should get killed before potentially killing a human. 3) A griefer player who chose to go inactive because he wants to farm xp without contributing or 3) A true inactive human, that happens to be hurting the team, contributing nothing and being a really easy target for mush to spore or transfer to. They are a liability, and removing them protects the human team. I would find it very difficult to justify trying to put the welfare of an inactive ahead of any other potentially human player.</p><p>Only exception being Chun and maybe Janice for the impact their death has on long term morale.</p>

                <p>Active human players will almost always have more suspicious activity connected with them then in inactive, just by virtue of the fact that they are <strong>doing things</strong>. Except in a utopian ship (which is unreasonable to set as the standard) human players that actively do stuff will accrue suspicion against them. And this is why pretending to be idle as a mush is a silly copout imo. My point is that if a human player is being purely rational about this and pursuing the goal of protecting the human team, it is logical to target the inactives first. As a human looking to support the team... if someone has to die, it makes more sense to risk killing an inactive human than an active one. At worst you have killed an uncontributing player. At best you've killed a mush or a parasite/griefer.</p><p>Now obviously this is only if a target has to be chosen. If you are lucky enough to be in a position where you can allow the status quo to continue running its course for a few days, then more power to you. But if the ship is tearing itself apart and action is required, I still maintain that inactives should fall before potentially killing an active human who could just be a new player learning the ropes.</p>

You've lowered all the humans' morale, you guaranteed the loss of a person, you may cause yourself and others in the same room as you and the victim a psychological disease, and they may help buy you time by suffocating before you do in a situation when O2 is depleted. If you have a good reason to kill an inactive, such as wasting Logistics or you have proof it's an inactive Mush, that's fine. If you kill an inactive <em>solely</em> because the person is inactive, the negative consequences <em>you</em> caused from killing an inactive is treated as hurting your side.</p>

                <p>There's also the fact that if they die of depression, there is NO morale loss for the rest of the human team. Almost half of the deaths (seven, including my own) on the murdership that I linked earlier were deaths as a result of morale loss - five of those were in the same cycle. Granted, I died last out of those, as a direct result of my morale dropping to zero after killing the Mush Ian.</p><p>They <em>might</em> put an end to it all instead of dying by starvation, thus saving the active crew from a direct morale hit.

Almost half of the deaths (seven, including my own) on the murdership that I linked earlier were deaths as a result of morale loss - five of those were in the same cycle. Granted, I died last out of those, as a direct result of my morale dropping to zero after killing the Mush Ian.</p><p>They <em>might</em> put an end to it all instead of dying by starvation, thus saving the active crew from a direct morale hit. But you <strong>guarantee</strong> the crew will take that morale hit if you kill them.</p></cite><p>If inactives are dieing of morale loss or suffocation as mentioned earlier, your ship will already be most certainly in an unrecoverable death spiral. I don't think panic attacks happen before maybe D5, so really they should only lose 1 morale per day plus one per death. Alternatively if you don't get the connection to Sol by D4 and you have 3 people die, they might suicide. If you don't get the connection to sol by D4, your ship is hardly going to survive for very long though...</p><p>I <strong>suppose</strong> if Chun dies on D1, it's also a slight possibility that they could suicide even if you did get comms - that's 8 morale lost by D4 so it would only require 3 deaths with the +3 morale from the connection.</p>

It's always a loss of one O2 per cycle (unless Oxygenated Ducts kick in,) and up to three O2 per cycle if <em>both</em> O2 tanks are broken. If the O2 runs out, one person will randomly suffocate each cycle until there's a new supply of O2, or everyone's dead. That check is also made before any O2 gained from plants kicks in.</p><p>Activity of individual players has absolutely no bearing on who dies in this case, so the more people alive, the lower the chances that you'll be chosen next.</p>

Most people go inactive on D2. That means on D3, they'll have the inactive status. On D4, they'll start starving, and on D5-6 they'll be dead. You can actually check them with the medkit on D3, and decide on D4 whether or not they're mush.</p><p>If one mush is inactive, you still have to track down who the other mush is. So you still have to keep track of the same amount of crew's movements and such.</p><p>This means that in order to actually save even a day of time mush hunting, you'd both have to have both mush be inactive, and have to kill them the instant they get the inactive status.Besides, as a ship goes on into D3, 4, or even 5 you'll know whether or not the mush are inactive.</p>

                <p>I just want to say, I don't who what player it is, but I was able to catch an XP farmer just by being an observant player while the person in question said nothing. So for anyone who says the only way to be caught XP farming by admitting it is nonsense. A lot of people have been caught by fellow players for XP farming, so don't think it's so easy to get away with it.</p><p>With that said, do not flood the SDF with reports by reporting all inactives just in case they happen to be breaking the rules. More often than not, these are people who play for the first time and then never come back, so we would rather have a few people get away with trying to pretend to be inactive rather than have hundreds of false positives. <strong>The SDF will sanction you for report abuse if you report all inactives with no evidence of them breaking the rules.</strong></p>

I knew it. But I suggest to add this point to rules. Or add special "Zzzz report button" to the game. If the moderators will receive 8 reports from 8 diffirent people on one man with "Zzz case", then moderators should act somehow. I suggest to block gaining XP for these people for 2 weeks or more. <br>If game designers will create new list of inactive in the code. Then it would be very easy to block players by amount of reports. There are already scripts that allow to show who, how many and when spoke and acts. There are already percentage of acivity on Command Pannel on the bridge. I don't think it is so difficult to apart report on "Inactivity reports" and "other reports". We live in 21 centure or I'm wrong, am not I?</p>

                <p>What they're telling you is that there are different kinds of inactivity. There may be people who start ships and become inactive on purpose just to farm xp (which personally I don't understand, because it's totally illogical... if you want to gain xp, it's because you like playing the game and you want to play it better, with better skills... so basically, in order to play better, they don't play ?). But there are also people who are inactive because of IRL problems that they couldn't foresee, and a lot of first time players who start playing and either give up completely, or sometimes go inactive and then come back to try again.</p><p>Xp farmers deliberately ruin the game for the rest of the ship. But the other inactives don't do it deliberately. I don't see how being reported by 1, 8 or 14 people for having a Zzz status proves that it was deliberate or not.</p>

And for someone that is primarily interested in gaining free xp, not being able to play the game for a time with lower leveled characters probably isn't a concern.

Because as a player I can do something about griefers. I can fix that problem and I would not be punished by acting against them. There is no such luxury with inactives, and that makes them more dangerous.

Pathetic Suicide isn't going to be made legal, and surrender is against the rules as well. That's not going to change.</p><p>If one active player says, "Screw this, I quit", and then commits suicide by cat, that makes the game that much more difficult for the other active players, and the negative effects will reverberate from there, possibly getting others to give up as well. That's why it's seen as griefing, because it is very much playing against one's team.</p><p>But these problems are related. If you as an active player aren't willing to keep going, despite the odds, then you have just made the odds more difficult for everyone else. It's factored in that a percentage of every crew will be inactive. That's one of the perils of a free to play model...you have to account for people who will try it out and find it isn't for them. But you <strong>also</strong> can't allow players the option to just give up/commit suicide/surrender, because the other team <em>deserves a challenging opponent</em>, not one who will maliciously give up just because they don't like the team they're on.</p><p>If you allow suicide, then every player who absolutely hates being Mush will suicide in the first few cycles, and screw over their team. But they'll also ruin the game for the human team; it's actually griefing <strong>both</strong> teams. How fun would the game be for you if both Mush were allowed to commit suicide by cat on day 1? Would you feel cheated out of a Mush hunt? By the same token, having griefers kill half the human team (active or not) ruins the game for the Mush, because it's a win they didn't <strong>earn</strong>.</p><p>And one last point...the game is not about always creating optimal conditions for a human victory. If you look at a lot of the MMM ships, they tend to take a heavy hand in maintaining activity, to the extent of finishing Antispore Gas research in literally the first cycle, and in many cases, the Mush didn't stand a chance. On the other hand, an active crew of 8 people can make it to Sol, and Eden is certainly possible. It's the victories when the odds were heavily stacked against you that make for the best stories.</p>

                <p>All of the ships prior to my first MMM were bad. I was ready to leave if it was not for MMM even though the premise of the game was very intersesting to me. A few ships post MMM and I'm not convinced normal ships are worth the time investment. My most fun non-MMM ship was a game where I was a Mush and I helped ruin the fun for everyone else in a ship (by murdering them) full of inactives who handicapped their team really badly.</p><p>Let's be honest if MT fixes inactives we will all be surprised. It is not the player's fault if they never do. It is not the player's fault if they take measures to make sure their time and effort is not completely wasted.</p>

Killing can get out of hand hunting mush too. But it isn't looked at in the same light. Seems hypocritical to me. Shrug.</cite><p>Actually, they're viewed in a similar light, with the common link being <strong>random killing with little or no evidence</strong>. Get dirty, but take more than two minutes to announce it in the dirty thread? <em>Kill them without talking to the crew first</em>. Borrow the Apron to eat a banana and a ration in the same cycle? <em>Kill them without consulting the crew, because <strong>only</strong> a Mush would take the Apron from the lab</em>. The examples from my own ships can go on and on, but the point remains that killing for flimsy reasons ultimately hurts the team. <br><cite>I worry about inactives more than griefers. Because as a player I can do something about griefers. I can fix that problem and I would not be punished by acting against them. There is no such luxury with inactives, and that makes them more dangerous. I think that is a great part of why this is such a hot issue, the lack of player ability to address elements hurting the ship. Either due to inadequacies in policy or game functionality.</cite><br>That isn't true, as has been stated multiple times in this thread. You have to have a good reason to kill <strong>anyone</strong>, or you risk sanctions. You can lay out all the evidence, be completely convinced that you have your Mush, and still be wrong. That doesn't guarantee that you'll be reported, much less sanctioned. But the <strong>motive</strong> is as important as the evidence here.</p><p>What would very likely get a sanction is if you kill multiple people for flimsy reasons, or just kill people randomly and hope you get a Mush. We see this happen a lot more than you would think, and being wrong too often can cause death spirals to start. The main problem with saying it's okay to kill inactives just for being inactive, is that this will lead to even more inevitable death spirals; it will also lead to less <em>investigation</em> and more <strong>random killings</strong> in hopes of getting the Mush. Murderships aren't fun.</p><p>That still doesn't mean (or even suggest) that inactives are to "never be killed". Protecting them (by healing them) can help keep <strong>your</strong> morale from dropping too fast, at least until they commit suicide on their own. But sometimes you have to maintain ship operations, and this is where the acceptable reasons come in. For example, if an inactive player is blocking Paola's Logistics bonus from going to Frieda, you can kill the inactive player. If they've been fully inactive since they woke up, and it's Day 5, it's obvious that they're Mush (or someone's been healing them for a while). And if they wake up and start attacking people randomly, kill and report them.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_7897961 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="7897961">Zangi</span></span><cite>Technically, from what I understand, Mush can choose to 'commit suicide' anytime they please. By attacking other players, dismantling useful stuff, taking the armor and hiding the weapons, grabbing stuff and hopping into the Pasiphea.</cite><p>Those are deaths that advance the Mush cause, and thus not considered pathetic suicides, as long as they are playing for their team when they do these things. Having their Mush partner(s) in on the plan helps clear the player in case it gets reported. But a Mush committing suicide by cat? Totally reportable, and we'll throw the book at them for it.</p>

They're not going to lay a finger on you, so why bother killing them? Why waste the AP you could be using making the best of a suboptimal situation by being part of the problem instead of being part of the solution? At least if inactives are the worst of your problems, you still have a chance to win. Now let's replace those inactives with griefers. Now, 16 active people of which 2 are Mush. At this point, the Mush stand little chance in winning. Then, one of humans starts killing a few humans, including you, and suddenly you're no longer part of potentially a great ship and the Mush now have a much better chance to win. Or, you could be a Mush and your Mush partner kills you.</p><p>Honestly, griefers are better than inactives? I'd like to put all those people who think that in a ship full of griefers and they can never go to a normal ship again.</p>

Pathetic Suicide isn't going to be made legal, and surrender is against the rules as well. That's not going to change.</p><p>If one active player says, "Screw this, I quit", and then commits suicide by cat, that makes the game that much more difficult for the other active players, and the negative effects will reverberate from there, possibly getting others to give up as well. That's why it's seen as griefing, because it is very much playing against one's team.</p><p>But these problems are related. If you as an active player aren't willing to keep going, despite the odds, then you have just made the odds more difficult for everyone else. It's factored in that a percentage of every crew will be inactive. That's one of the perils of a free to play model...you have to account for people who will try it out and find it isn't for them. But you <strong>also</strong> can't allow players the option to just give up/commit suicide/surrender, because the other team <em>deserves a challenging opponent</em>, not one who will maliciously give up just because they don't like the team they're on.</p><p>If you allow suicide, then every player who absolutely hates being Mush will suicide in the first few cycles, and screw over their team. But they'll also ruin the game for the human team; it's actually griefing <strong>both</strong> teams. How fun would the game be for you if both Mush were allowed to commit suicide by cat on day 1? Would you feel cheated out of a Mush hunt? By the same token, having griefers kill half the human team (active or not) ruins the game for the Mush, because it's a win they didn't <strong>earn</strong>.</p><p>And one last point...the game is not about always creating optimal conditions for a human victory. If you look at a lot of the MMM ships, they tend to take a heavy hand in maintaining activity, to the extent of finishing Antispore Gas research in literally the first cycle, and in many cases, the Mush didn't stand a chance. On the other hand, an active crew of 8 people can make it to Sol, and Eden is certainly possible. It's the victories when the odds were heavily stacked against you that make for the best stories.</p></cite><p>Suicide was a joke, because i don't want to waste gold days. It's not going against the odds, there are no odds. There are hovever a brick wall, and your head, nothing else. I'm not saying that it should be easy, but there are a big difference between hard, and impossible, and it's not because we're not working in a team, or we get bad luck with expo, or can't coordinata a simple neron/lab/pilgred cycle, or we had a mental serial killer on the ship. It's not in the metagame, just because they don't feel like to create a 2 room tutorial, they throw their main gamer base into a hole to die slowly.<br> And that 8 player sol is possible, but you need to get lucky with is active( no pilots/tech is certen doom ), so again, not metagame, but pure blind luck, what has nothing to do with your or my actions.</p>

                <p>honestly, think about it, what could gone wrong there? I mean, you are a new player, so you join up, they say that you shoud go to the kitchen, but you realize that you don't like the game, and you quit, ( maybe they thinking that if you can't choose straight, then a crew can pull you in ) the ship you would join is happily continue the jurney without characters who wake up, and mistically turn braindead.<br>The second one if you got hooked, so you will be back any way.<br>I can't really think about a path, what can go wrong about it. Can you?</p>

I'm not an XP farmer, I never will be, but I actually cannot imagine how one could be caught (possibly because I cannot see an efficient way to XP farm.... more than a high level character, it takes a high level *player*, personal experience in problem solving and right actions, to be a player with a successful character of any level).</p><p>I can see why you may hesitate to explain what gives people away who are XP farmers (ooh, then the XP farmers know what to do to get away with it better!), but I'm frankly baffled at what anyone could see, other than outright admission, to indicate XP farming versus any other type of inactivity.</p><p>Npfan, would you be willing to characterize the traits of a catchable XP farmer? If you are concerned about discussing it publicly (Shame if so.... surely I'm not the only player who enthusiastically reports rule violations, yet who cannot imagine identifying an XP farmer), maybe through a PM?</p>

Let's think about that for a moment. If you have some inactives on a ship, what's wrong with leaving them alone? They're not going to lay a finger on you, so why bother killing them? Why waste the AP you could be using making the best of a suboptimal situation by being part of the problem instead of being part of the solution? At least if inactives are the worst of your problems, you still have a chance to win. Now let's replace those inactives with griefers. Now, 16 active people of which 2 are Mush. At this point, the Mush stand little chance in winning. Then, one of humans starts killing a few humans, including you, and suddenly you're no longer part of potentially a great ship and the Mush now have a much better chance to win. Or, you could be a Mush and your Mush partner kills you.</p><p>Honestly, griefers are better than inactives? I'd like to put all those people who think that in a ship full of griefers and they can never go to a normal ship again.</p></cite><p>I didn't say they were <strong>better</strong>, I said I <strong>worry about inactives more</strong> because I have no ability to do anything about them. What's wrong with leaving them alone is it encourages the behavior. On that and all future ships. Others see crew going inactive and some think hey, maybe I should go inactive too, why should I try hard when they won't? The reason inactivity is so prevalent is because nothing is done about it. Because there are no consequences. A precedent has been set. So the current policies have encouraged it, made it worse, more common. If hypothetically speaking inactivity was punished, or at the very least not rewarded, we would have a lot less of it, and the community as a whole would benefit.</p><p>You talk about chance of winning. I don't care about winning. I care about having a fun ship. I care about not wasting my time and my money. I want other players to also have fun ships and not waste their time and money. But when the rules condemn players to ships full of inactives, and punish them for trying to do something about it, that isn't going to happen. I don't know of any other game that actually locks the player into a shitty experience, under threat of suffering additional penalties if they try to escape <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/surprise.gif" alt=":anim_surprised:" class="tid_ico">.</p>

                <p>just let the ship run it's course it will be over faster while do you can try some of the other games.What about the people that aren't killed by the griefer now they have to suffer a slow death to if they damage the ship real bad.the only thing I mostly seen to do with the inactives is to kill which doesn't really benefit the ship most of the time.I would love to help out in random ship land but computer charger sorted.^^ I say a great story if mange to make to sol still and if can't make to sol see how far you can get.</p>

She's bemoaning lack of activity but yet she herself is inactive. A distinction needs to be drawn between IDLE and Inactive, they are significantly different.</p><p>My point is, people give up on ships where people are not constantly monitoring the chat and that sort of attitude needs to change. People give up the second the ship doesn't run smoothly... that also needs to change.</p><p>I was really frustrated for a while due to terrible ships, but eventually came to embrace the idle players as a part of the game, it makes you have to think outside of the box, forces people to work together to accomplish things that they normally might not think possible. All it takes is a little leadership... as Cliche as this phrase is it's true "Be the change you want to see"</p><p>Edit: I'd also like to say that I PERSONALLY have been having better and better experiences with ships, perhaps it's the fact that I step up into a leadership role, or perhaps the player base is becoming a little more consistent. But honestly I've seen fewer and fewer players that just up and quit the game, It used to be 6+, now I'm only seeing averages of 3 or so. That's quite an improvement, but we as a community need to be here to teach them how to play so they keep coming back.</p>

For that you would need to be unemployed or be able to check on mush at school or work. For higher activity than that you would have to wake up during the night <strong>just</strong> to check up on mush, which would be insanity. If it is absolutely vital to the ship's survival I <strong>might</strong> do that, but expecting it of some one is unreasonable.</p><p>Checking on mush twice a day is a very reasonable way to play, if you put some work into it like setting up relays and speding AP efficiently that way. Unless you get the dealt the captain or comms manager card - then you can hurt the ship quite bad if you're only available twice a day. If some one is active on half of the cycles, that means they're available for mush pretty much 12 hours a day...</p>

                <p>Yeah, there's no way I'd call a person who is on 4/8 cycles an "inactive player" especially if it makes sense in the context of their role, there are only so many APs you can earn in a day and so many that you can eat safely (as part of clean-crew) without making it a chore for the rest of the crew to do their tasks. What would be annoying is if said Paola only ever logged in for the 4 cycles directly before a signal pops up (say, C1-4 when the daily signal comes in at C5), but that is something that can be addressed with a simple conversation. People just need to be more understanding of the situations that can/will pop up unexpectedly and roll with the punches, it's no different than getting RNG screwed on an expedition or having to deal with a cruel hunter wave.</p><p>I'd say there are really only 4-5 characters (or character roles) where going on in excess of 4 times a day is recommended or necessary: the Commander (JinSu, Chao, Gioele), the mush investigation crew (Chun, Chao, Eleesha), the main exploration pilot (usually Hua), and whoever is heading up the most active research/project. For all others it's nice to be on 5+ times, but would you really fault them for not tying their life schedule to an online flash game? People have to eat and attend meetings/class.</p>

Also, let's say i just want to grief, so i log in, go to the kitchan, have a nice meal, then wait for your message that the game is finished, so i get a fev glory, depend ont the character, did not even think about the game for a week, not pay to you, or tell it to my friends, and if someone have problem with it, i've got defended by you, basically for me it means, that you value your 3 min playtime never_to_be_seen again guy more, then a paying customer, who happend to work on a pc, and chk this game a lot more than average. And again, sorry for being rude, but your support did not even answer my tickets. What would you think?</p>

                <p>I didn't expect I'd write something this long to address the inactivity issue, but if you need a Mod post to quote, then this should cover it...</p><p>As it's been said, time and time again, on <strong>many</strong> of these inactivity threads: <strong>Inactives are a part of the game.</strong> That doesn't mean you have to <em>like</em> them, much less be <em>happy</em> about them. But you do have to <strong>work around them as best you can</strong>. If not for yourself, then do it for the other active players...yes, even the Mush. Giving up is never going to be an option, because every active person who <em>chooses</em> to give up/suicide reduces the odds for everyone else.</p><p>The game has been balanced in such a way that you can have several inactives on every ship and still have a chance to successfully return to Sol, if not Eden. Not every ship will have that many of them. In fact, my last ship had only one. Most of my ships have had <em>at least</em> 2-3, and I've been on ships where half the players were fully inactive. I've been on ships with 5-7 inactives, yet we still made it to Sol. You can't control who ends up on your ship with you, but giving up because you don't like the odds just makes the problem worse.</p><p>But look at it from this perspective...most of the inactives are players on their first game. Most of those have less than three games played. Did you go inactive at all on your first few ships? If so, was it intended to grief anyone? In my case, it was yes - on my first ship, and not intentional in the least; I just didn't understand the game yet, and it was beta. I'm sure my first crew hated what I did at the time (I was Jin Su) but that didn't stop me from improving from that point. If my crew had killed me from the first moment I went inactive, I might have stayed away from the game. <span class="tid_sideNote">For what it's worth, since that first ship, I've never once had the inactive status, and I'm on ship #30 at the time of this post.</span></p><p>I'm not trying to "excuse" inactivity, nor am I trying to "defend" it. I <em>am</em> saying that most of the proposed solutions for inactivity have been tried, and have not worked. This includes tutorial ships, which the devs have specifically said they're not going to be trying again. I <em>am</em> saying that inactivity is frustrating, and I get that; I've dealt with it on many of my ships, just like the rest of you. I've also been on more than a few murderships, just because someone thought that anyone dirty or inactive was probably a Mush...and they started killing randomly.</p><p>I <em>am</em> saying that complaining about inactive players, or threatening to kill them just for going inactive, <strong>does not solve the problem</strong>. As experienced players, it falls to us to create the social environment the newbies need to communicate more, and to encourage them to stick around. Not everyone who tries this game will like it, and that applies to any game. But the active playerbase is slowly expanding, and I've been noticing a greater percentage of active newbies on many of my ships. My last ship was a day 12 Sol run, with both Mush killed, and a few players who were on their very first ship.</p><p><strong>Give them a reason to stick around</strong>; and more than one, if you can. The thrill of the Mush hunt; the harrowing stories of survival against the odds; that time you got sent to a Volcanoes planet and didn't lose anyone; even the RP between certain players...whatever you can do to impart how fun this game can be. That won't get everyone hooked on the game, but every person you CAN convince to stay active will help your current ship, and their future ships. You can't control the inactives; but you <strong>can</strong> control how <em>you</em> treat them, and if you fail, at least you can say that you tried. If you don't try, then you don't have as valid a complaint.</p><p>Also, if you give up on them, then you're not helping to fix the problem...just keep that in mind, too.</p>

                <p>One thing that would probably really help the game to some extent is to make the three command characters only unlockable with xp. That way first time players couldn't take Jin Su, Paola or Janice.</p><p>I'd probably add a bunch of other characters like Freida and Chun to that list, but those three are the real crippling characters to have inactive noobs in.</p><p>How low do the ships oxygen levels need to drop before it's no longer a santionable offence to murder the captain?<br>How many rebel bases do you need to see slip away without any work done on them at all, before you're allowed to kill the comms officer?</p><p>Spaz, I see what you are saying about morale, but if the inactive player has (a metal sheet fall on them/burns to death in a fire/dies of starvation) the crew loses just as much morale as if they had beaten the inactive to death. Which pretty much renders you morale argument invalid. There is no morale upside to letting them live. You're basically demanding that we let them live on the off-chance that they somehow die from morale loss.</p><p>I get that slaughtering half the crew is bad but I can't see a plausible reason to not murder a member of command crew that is inactive the moment they get flagged as inactive.</p><p>Making it so that xp farmers can report players that kill them and interrupt their free xp gain is just naff. But that's basically what you guys are doing with this judgement.</p>

                <p>I already established that you CAN kill inactive title holders, if they repeatedly retake their title, but aren't doing their job. And if said player was highly active, then stops being active midway through the voyage, you can report them for that as well. (That doesn't guarantee a sanction, but if they quit in the middle of a game, and they <strong>actually state</strong> that they're giving up, you should definitely <em>report it</em>.)</p><p>Likewise, if their inactivity is <em>directly</em> hindering ship operations, such as interfering with the Logistics bonus, that is also an acceptable reason to kill them. But if they are causing no <strong>direct</strong> harm through their inactivity, and they don't show any reason to suspect they're Mush (i.e. five days inactive, and still alive) then you should let them die on their own. If they're holding something the ship needs, like the Apron or Mush Sample, it's also acceptable to kill them if they go inactive with it...then again, that's a very Mushy thing to do, which lends itself to the suspicion point above.</p><p>The SDF considers killing inactive players <strong>just</strong> for being inactive to be the same as random killing without sufficient evidence. Neither are allowed, without <em>some</em> compelling evidence that the player may be Mush, or are directly interfering in ship operations, as noted above. Those are the exceptions you can work within. Being inactive from the start of the ship is <strong>not a good enough reason on its own</strong>.</p><p>So, there ARE acceptable reasons to kill inactive players...it's just not acceptable to kill them when being inactive is the <strong>only</strong> thing they're doing wrong. As noted, most of the inactive players are new to the game. And you never know, they may come back and be useful, if you give them the chance. And if they come back and grief the ship, kill and report them...there's a higher chance that they'll be useful, rather than a griefer. I just had a player who went inactive from the start of the ship come back on, and she's been active and helpful since then. She'd been inactive for only a few cycles, but if we'd killed her <em>immediately</em>, we would have been short one active player, the AP used for the kill, and the morale lost.</p><p>Look at it this way: You can Do the Thing with someone only once per day, and it's one of the more reliable ways to gain morale, if your Shrink is inactive. Bananas aren't to be eaten until after the hydropots are full, and fruit from expos may not even boost morale. If you kill your inactives by day 3, you're wasting AP, and taking the morale hit(s) rather early on. If you wait to kill them, not only might they come back to the game (which has happened on more than a few of my ships) but you spread out the potential morale hits. It gives your active crew time to shore up their morale, as well, especially with an active Shrink or two. If you're stuck with Doing the Thing, then at least some of your crew can rotate who they boost their morale with, over the course of a few days.</p><p>I've had panic attacks start as early as day 2. If the first person woke up on D1C8, and Chun is one of the last people to wake up, the first people are already going to be low on morale. Killing inactives too early can lead to murderships, and I've witnessed that firsthand. Even in the reports I've seen, about 90% of the time, it's one person deciding that inactives should die, not consulting the crew beforehand, and causing everyone else to deal with the consequences.</p>

                <p>I came up with three possible fixes to the inactives problem.</p><p>You could have a routine that keeps tabs on new players while they're doing the tutorial. Detect players who get bored and don't finish it, bounce them back to character selection and replace them in the ship with another queing player. Ship starts might get longer &amp; longer but it'd be worth it.</p><p>Build a Sandbox Server just for new players. Give them their own ship with a full crew of inactives, they all stand at their appropriate work stations and don't move. Expand and refine the tutorial into a proper character walkthrough. When their APs or MPs run out give them 'tutorial aps' from a pool of say 50. Give them all the skills and give a popup telling them in a real game they'd need to select this character and buy this skill with XP. Let them run around clicking everthing, loading all the fuel, cooking and eating all the rations, pills and bananas, Let them fly patrol ships against a constantly replaced wave of hunters that do no damage. Let them scan for planets, move the ship, explore planets where they take half or normal damage and find nothing but tell them what they would have found if they were on a real ship, fly the Pasiphae and getting real scrap (or again tell them what they would have got). Let them have as long as they like, but reduce the hull armor by 5 for every 10 minutes that they're logged in. Display a nice big 'Leave Tutorial Ship And Join Your First Ship' button. When the tutorial ship blows up give them a cool achievements log and a big 'Play Again' button. Sandbox lovers would really enjoy a chance to get into this game before they join a real ship. And hardcore gamers who like to learn as they play can just jump right in.</p><p>Of course it would be helpful to know why people go inactive. If it's the game itself then the first solution would work. If it's the other players shouting at them for not knowing how to play the game then the second solution would work.</p><p>Other people go inactive because they were waiting too long for their ship to fill up. The solution to this would be a more standard lobby with a list of shipservers. Each shipserver lists all the characters currently picked and each ship only starts once 16 players have joined. With lobby-chat and ship-chat you could organise ship moves &amp; negotiate character selection/swaps, plan strategies, etc. Player groups/MMM can start silver/gold-only servers or fill up more empty ships. You'd get a picture of how many people are online throughout the day. Mush would be on equal terms from D1C1 instead of relying on everyone observing neutral play. There's a lot of plusses to having normal gameservers &amp; it kind of rules out a need for my first two suggestions. You could have temporary/unscored sandbox tutorial servers, player moderated tutorial servers, etc.. Anyway, that's the way I'd like to see this game go, it's a lot more flexible than the current game-start situation.</p>

                <p>Alternative view: Inactives are an essential part of Mush.</p><p>My Defense: I understand why people don't like inactive players. They don't contribute to a human victory, and add obstacles and remove skills from the human side.</p><p>However, inactives are important to give Mush a fighting chance. A ship can be successfully run and returned to Sol even at less than half strength. Without inactives, the odds are incredibly stacked against Mush. Inactives add another variable to a complex game, and also help give Mush players shelter when they need to be less than active on the ship to avoid contributing too much to the ship's benefit or cut down on the danger of exposure.</p><p>In short, inactives help give Mush camouflage and keep the Human side from always winning. To me, inactives add a key ingredient to the complexity of Mush.</p>

                <p>I saw Revanus' response in the "unwarranted tactics" thread and knew they were a person of my own heart when it comes to the Mush Hunting phase. Inactivity/noncommunication decreases certainty and that uncertainty is the window that allows a covert/hidden agent mush to thrive in the phase that's supposed to be about paranoia. It's the rando-games, not the MMMs, that generate the most memorable successful mush tactics, despite the likelihood that the mush might have spawned into a situation where 1 or more anti-mush researches has been completed.</p><p>People say "OH NO, WHY NOT RESTRICT ANTI-MUSH RESEARCH UNTIL ALL PLAYERS HAVE SPAWNED! SO UNFAIR FOR MUSH". It's actually a two-way street for this. One that had a Volkswagen bug <strong>(non-neutral preselection anti-mush research)</strong> on one side and the other that has an 18-wheeler on the other <strong>(for the vast majority of players who get picked as Alphas, aka sub Mushlvl11 players)</strong> once you eliminate the uncertainty of how much AP a player claims they have used based on the knowledge that every player starts with 8 action points and 12 movement points and that one of the showers will be removed by D1C2-3 while there is a dorm camera watching... well, how are you gonna lie about a 10 AP deficit? (<strong>i'd love to see some clever phagocyte play being used in a social engineering / covert route to gain mush investigation chat access</strong>)</p><p>But I digress. The rando ships have always been the more challenging mush hunts because of how much more "freedom to now move about the cabin" the Alphas have. If they completely removed rando games I'm not sure I'd bother playing much longer, so any solution that includes <strong>eliminating</strong> inactivity is just not viable (nor enforceable).</p>

I love the desperation and paranoia that laces every day and cycle, as the humans try to plug the ever-widening array of leaks and the Mush attempt to stab everyone in the heart. For me, inactives just help raise the tension and the stakes of my Human play, while keeping my Mush play efficient and viable.<br><br>If Alpha Mush have to worry about 14 other players instead of 8, it's that much harder to leave the Daedelus a smoking ruin and human corpses floating in the void of space. The game is meant to have inefficiency-it's why we only get 3 default cameras, 7 beds, and one bar of soap.<br><br>I haven't found myself on an MMM ship yet, but I do know that inefficiency is at the heart of what makes Mush tick. To suggest that this game is only viable with a full crew of silver/gold players, 5 cameras, and a ship free of noobish mistakes or inactivity is to steal away some of the dynamic tension that makes this game so great.</p>

And really if you cant survive that long without moving, you gotta think about your ships coordination and you have worse problems than inactives, or very bad RNG.</p>

Really, i could have showered/cat down to ~3 life, killed the first active player, transferred to the second. and punched my old body for a 2-3 day victory. Both me and my partner are more beneficial than half the crew just because its in such a sad state.</p>

After I converted the captain he flew us back to sol when we still had 4 spores so we could have converted another player or two. I was hoping to get only mush back by but I'll just pretend we converted them on sol ;p. Our Stephan transferred to Raluca with no time to spare, she had 1 morale left and chun was dead; otherwise a 0-&gt;100 on pilgred would have been PAINFUL. Decently fun, turns out most of the crew just didn't talk and most ended up logging in at least once before the game was over so it wasn't QUITE as inactive as I thought. Although I wouldn't mind getting mush every game. BTW I loved roland's comment, he lost the ability to read chat when an alien stole his radio so we just treated him like a drone with pilot; I don't think he realized how bad the infection got.</p>
