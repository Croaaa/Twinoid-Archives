I'm a bit surprised, that in most of my games I did not need any B-mush to win and I never was made B-mush myself.</p><p>So, please answer few questions about your games, to see how different players play. If you don't remember accurate numbers - just write what events are more common.</p><p>- How many times you was choosen as Alpha-mush? - 8<br>- How many times you had become Beta-mush? - 0<br>- How many B-mush you made yourself, while playing a mush? - 1<br>- How many times you won as mush my rampage/sabotage/etc (any act that damage crew a lot and destoy the ship/whole crew) - 3<br>- How many times you rushed PILGRED and return to Sol yourself - 3<br>- How many times you were returned to Sol playing as mush, while humans were sure all mushes are gone? - 0<br>- How many times you lost while playing a mush? - 2<br>- How many times you were cured with RFS? - 0</p>

                <p>sometimes it is combined-for example I saw a ship where mush sabotaged things that hard that people wanted to finish pilgred after killing mush, but mush also achieved to get a sneaky betamush who almost returned to sol because of that (but humans seemed to have lost hope, so hunters ended it xD)</p><p>One time I was able to get some mushy partners, but before we were able to kill every human, hunters destroyed the ship as well (one human was left).</p><p>Or one time my mush partners and myself were able to kill all humans AND return to sol.</p><p>I also lost one time, but still got the golden supernova.

All I did was lie back and wait for the ship to die around me. Near the end I grabbed the last of the air from the tank and let everyone else suffocate. I was killed by Neron as last surviving member of the ship. I don't consider that enough to earn a "rampage/sabotage/ect..." mark though as I didn't really disrupt them that badly.</p><p>As Janice I was a Beta Mush turned while I was getting an extinguisher from the Rear Corridor (it was trapped). I took Anonamush quickly after. Since I had been a helpful player prior to that people trusted me so I used that trust to relay info to my other mush allies. I kept up my helpful behavior all the way to the end and we jumped back to Sol with me aboard.</p>
