Sometimes mush doesn`t know about camera in ENG-room or Nexus, direct spike there and busted. So maybe it better to know where you should stay more accurate.</p><p>And yes. I play 500+ cycles as mush in non-castings ship. And I see no problem if someone install a cameras before mush selection.

I'd like to think it isn't outdated.</p><p><cite>The actual rule is that no ship item may be held before mush selection. Ship items are defined by items you did not personally enter play already carrying, and were not given during the tutorial. So you may legally hold your trackie, talkie, itrackie; if you have a skill that places items in your inventory such as paranoid or green thumb, you may continue to hold those items before mush selection without breaking any rules. All other items are forbidden, by rule, to be held before mush selection; all other items are what I consider to be 'ship items'.</cite></p><p>My understanding is that a lot of the rules of the "non exhaustive" list in the SDF rules thread have undergone a certain amount of clarification since they were made. Dig around on the forums enough and you can often find these kinds of conversations have already happened.</p><p>I'm remembering the 10+ page debate we had during the beta as to what was fair game for pre-mush selection. *war flashbacks*</p><p>In any case, for now I would assume this to be the current ruling on Paranoid, Neutral Play, and Holding Items. I'm sure these things are open to a fair amount of discussion, but for me, forcing someone to install cameras that, for some players, are forced upon them off the bat? That'd be a tough sell for me.</p>

                <p>I agree with this rule. People who owned items from Green Thumb, Paranoid, Robotics Expert as well as Schrödinger and food from Vending Mashine may hold them as long as they wish.</p><p>SDF forbids holding items found on the ship to keep balance. That's not fair as last character awaken has no chances to get weapon, armor, Hacker Kit, etc. That somebody takes it and nobody finds them because somebody in the beginning got them and there were few people to get the chance that somebody would check.</p><p>But answering the title: If installing cameras was forbidden before Mush selection, it'd be more fun. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Here is summary about Neutral play, enjoy.</p><p>Short version:<br>- You can install cameras before mush selection<br>- You don't have to install them if you don't want, if somebody like Chun is saying stuff like - Stephen you are generalist, you should install cameras before selection - you can ignore her if you like<br>- Gioele is not forced to take Paranoid or install cameras if he took it</p><p>Long version:</p><p><cite>Neutral play.<br><br>1. What's neutral play?<br>There are some special rules, that are applied to everyone before mush selection. After the last 16th player joins the ship and you see yellow mush icons to appear - neutral play is over.<br><br>2. Do we just play as humans before mush selection?<br>No, it's not like that. As human you should do everything to help your human team to win. Before mush selection you don't. For example - as Pilot you can ignore hunters, as Paranoid Gioele you can wait with installing cameras. While nothing stops you from doing such actions, you cannot be forced by anyone to do it.<br><br>3. What items can you move before mush selection?<br>You can move any items, you want, just be sure you dropped them after picking up. About holding items for long see next question:<br><br>4. What items can you hold before mush selection?<br>You cannot hold any items that are not "yours" - like weapons, apron, hacker's kit, armor.<br>Personal items: <br>- Talkie, Tracker, iTrakie, <br>- Items that you got from your skills: Drone BP (Robotics expert), Extra pots (Green Trumb), Extra cameras (Paranoid)<br>- Any stuff you have bought from vending machine<br>Also it's ok to take a ration of a cup of coffee for yourself, but holding pills (like +3ap +3morale pills especially) is not right.<br>While by lore our dear cat belongs to Raluca, he don't not counts as personal item for her.<br><br>5. Is Chun allowed to hold these items before selection, she will be human anyway...<br>No, she is not allowed. The purpose of neutral play is to give both teams a fair start, not to make sure mushes don't get some stuff. <br><br>6. What other actions are not allowed before mush selection?<br>You cannot make actions, that will clearly hurt human team, or just annoy everyone before you became a mush. There are some examples, but use common sence:<br>- Eating bananas/alien fruits, when humans want to plant them is wrong<br>- Dismantling objects, nobody wants to be dismantled is wrong (like second shower or tabulatrix)<br>- Guarding corridors to make players suffer is wrong<br>- Throw people from the room without any reason is wrong<br><br>7. What actions are allowed then?<br>You can do any ship maintenance, that game mechanics allow you.<br>- You can work on projects <br>- You can scan planets<br>- You can work on research, that is not against mush (examples: NCC lenses, Anabolics)<br>- You can kill hunters and collect the loot<br>- You can build any items from BPs<br>- If you think it's a good idea - you can even hack commanders terminal or NERON bios to use them before selection<br>Also you can do a few things, that clearly hurts mush team. <br>- You can dismantle one of showers<br>- You can install cameras<br><br>8. But you said nobody can force you to do these...<br>Yes, that's right - all actions above are just allowed. If you don't want to do anything before selection - don't do that. You can stay in lab doing nothing, to be ready to spend all your ap/mp/free points for your team as soon as you'll see who you are.<br><br>9. People say I should take a shower, if I got dirty before selection.<br>Again - it's up to you. While it's not right to just become dirty with playing with fuel to have advantage as mush, if you got dirty while doing stuff like dismanteling or installing cameras - you can wait for selection before taking shower.<br><br>10. People say I should select my skills or/and use them (like go to dorm as Shrink)<br>And again - it's only up to you. Not selecting skills can be good idea for most humans as well btw. Hua/KT/Eleesha can suddenly take Tech after mushes rampaged to kill all teches, or JS can select Pilot between Leader after having a full picture.<br><br>12. What should I do, if somebody is breaking neutral play?<br>If he just don't know about such rules or say they are different - tell him about it and give him link to this post. If he is breaking on purpose - you can report him. If it's clear, that he wants to use weapons he got to make some kills just after selection or wants to steal them with Pasi - you can kill him just before selection.</cite></p>

                <p>It's not a problem in terms of neutrality, because if there are no cameras in the dorms, it gives a <em>distinct</em> advantage to the Mush team, especially if they're high level and Gold. We want to give as fair a start as possible to both teams, and that is a clear advantage to the Mush side, rather than a fairer start for both.</p><p>So no, we're not changing the rules on that one. Most ships will have dorm cameras installed pre-selection, and that is acceptable. There will <em>usually</em> be people idling outside of camera protected rooms once selection happens, so there will typically be at least a few targets available at the start, without forcing the dorms to remain unprotected.</p>

                <p>I feel like you might be barking up the wrong tree with this one brohan. Placing the cameras in dorms and on the bridge pre-mush is a pretty standard move. One that's rarely ever actually prevented the mush from winning all on its own.</p><p>Now, allowing mush to get an easy conversion right off the bat? That's a game changer. Once you've got three mush in play, you can manage a conversion every day if you're coordinated enough.</p><p>But hey, if you feel that strongly about it, the rules clearly state that no-one is <em>required</em> to place cameras. If you feel it's that big of an advantage, no-one is forcing you to place them. And if you can convince enough other people that it's not a good idea, then you'll start seeing ships that don't have all the cameras installed until after mush are selected.</p><p>Until THAT happens, I doubt the rules would change. Otherwise it would be a fairly drastic change to the rules.</p><p>I for one have never actually installed a camera before mush selection. That's usually because they're either already installed, I've been injured, or I've had other things to do since I usually play a pilot. I'm sure there are other people who just flat out decide not to install cameras, even if they don't announce their intentions publicly on every ship.</p><p>EDIT: You may also want to consider playing on casting ships if you can. From my understanding, mush are selected nigh instantly on those, so you'd sort of get your way by default. I've never actually played on a casting ship before, though. So I don't know for sure.</p>

However, it is ALSO not a violation of Neutral play if they ARE installed in the usual places. See? Nobody is "required" to make the optimal camera placements.</p><p>Two Alphas with Mycelium Spirit and Infector can convert someone in seconds after selection. If that player is also a high level Alpha with those two skills, that only exponentially increases the advantage the Mush team gets if the dorms are unprotected. Now, <em>if that's the fault of the human team</em>, so be it. However, we are NOT changing the Neutral Play rules so that the Mush team gets a distinct advantage by default. That is what you're suggesting <em>should</em> be allowed to happen, and we're not doing it.</p><p>Unless it can be proven that installing a camera elsewhere was a deliberate act of griefing, we're not sanctioning for it, but players who do so risk getting killed by their crews in response. It's a fair reason to suspect someone as a griefer, and so IF one installs a camera other than the usual locations, and makes no attempt to justify that action, they can die for it. <strong>Take that action at your own risk.</strong> If you get killed for it, the SDF is probably going to rule in your killer's favor, because it's a damned suspicious action to take. It may not be a violation of Neutral Play, but that's not the reason for which they'd kill you.</p><p><span class="tid_mod">Now let me be undeniably clear: We are NOT changing the Neutral Play rules on this, regardless of your opinion on how "fair" it is to either side.</span></p>

                <p>I only tend to rampage when I'm sure what I do during my rampage will destroy the ship, and I don't have many other options. Like if I can manage to sabotage both O2 tanks on a ship that's on its last day of oxygen. Or if I can kill the last pilot or two on a ship that's having trouble with armor.</p><p>Rampaging is really only satisfying if you know you can make the humans scramble to fix the problems you're creating, and since a lot of ships are used to having inactives nowadays, a rampage in the first couple days of the ship rarely ever accomplishes this. You may as well have done nothing at all in that case.</p>

                <p>You know, the reason the Mush Sample doesn't spawn until the moment of Mush Selection is <strong>explicitly because</strong> people would find it, rush CS and ASG, and both would be done long before the ship even filled. If you think the Mush are severely disadvantaged <em>now...</em></p><p>Each of the bullet points you just listed are a natural part of the game, and the devs aren't likely to do anything to change them. You play with the cards you're dealt. If the ship fills slowly, and most of the potential pilots are only bronze without Pilot, you might be the last to wake up and see the hull under 50 or worse. So what? <strong>You just deal with it as best you can.</strong> I've had ships like that, and we still killed our Mush and made it back to Sol. Other times, the Mush were able to turn the screws against us, and we lost.</p><p>FYI, one of the reasons the devs aren't going to "do anything" about this dynamic is simple: You're never going to have a perfect ship, for either team. There's far too much randomness (including the quality of the players, and their level of knowledge/opportunity to take advantage of mistakes) for that. Yeah, every ship starts with exactly four hunters, guaranteed. It used to be even more random...at the start, you could have six or eight hunters from the ship's first cycle, or none at all. Even then, more could show up within the next few cycles, and it was even worse to not have any pilots. So they chose to start with just four hunters, and let the rest show up depending on time and AP spent.</p><p>Neutral Play rules exist to give both sides as fair a start as possible. Yes, this means the humans can even finish the Mycoscan before the ship fills (as the only anti-Mush research you can possibly conduct during Neutral Play - it'll be even more important next season.) It <em>also</em> means the humans can place cameras in the usual spots, because as has already been stated, the Mush can gain a <strong>significant</strong> advantage if the dorms are unprotected at the moment of Mush selection.</p><p><span class="tid_mod">As I already stated, we're NOT changing the Neutral Play rules, no matter your objections to them. If the Mush are winning more than average on your ships, then use that experience to become a better hunter. If you're consistently losing as Mush, that's not the fault of the rules. Either way, learn from their mistakes, as much as your own. The win rate for both teams is close to 50/50, with a slight advantage in favor of the humans...so if you're consistently losing on either team, you're an outlier.</span></p>

So discussions are moot anyway... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></cite><p>If that statement is pointing at me... The answer to the question number 16 is just: It is <strong>allowed</strong> to put on cameras before selection, but there are no rules like: It is <strong>required</strong> to install them before selection. Installing them before selection is giving the human team a small advantage, not installing them is giving mushes a <strong>small</strong> advantage (what I wanted to show with my statement). Izpo spoke of a <strong>huge</strong> advantage and that everone should install cameras in <strong>interest of neutral play</strong>. Opinions how you as player want to act here may differ though in most cases other people would install it anyway pre - selection. And just that was my point, nothing else. And as long as that is a healthy forum, there will be different opinions, we can't just allow to post only certain point of views - especially when it is not even in conflict with any rules.</p>

We want to give as fair a start as possible to both teams, and that is a clear advantage to the Mush side, rather than a fairer start for both.<br><br>So no, we're not changing the rules on that one. Most ships will have dorm cameras installed pre-selection, and that is acceptable. There will <em>usually </em>be people idling outside of camera protected rooms once selection happens, so there will typically be at least a few targets available at the start, without forcing the dorms to remain unprotected.</cite></p><br><p><cite>Let me put it this way: It's NOT a violation of Neutral Play if someone installs any camera(s) outside of the "usual" places. However, it is ALSO not a violation of Neutral play if they ARE installed in the usual places. See? Nobody is "required" to make the optimal camera placements.<br><br>Two Alphas with Mycelium Spirit and Infector can convert someone in seconds after selection. If that player is also a high level Alpha with those two skills, that only exponentially increases the advantage the Mush team gets if the dorms are unprotected. Now,<em> if that's the fault of the human team, so be it</em>. However, we are NOT changing the Neutral Play rules so that the Mush team gets a distinct advantage by default. That is what you're suggesting <em>should </em>be allowed to happen, and we're not doing it.<br><br>Unless it can be proven that installing a camera elsewhere was a deliberate act of griefing, we're not sanctioning for it, but players who do so risk getting killed by their crews in response. It's a fair reason to suspect someone as a griefer, and so IF one installs a camera other than the usual locations, and makes no attempt to justify that action, they can die for it. Take that action at your own risk. If you get killed for it, the SDF is probably going to rule in your killer's favor, because it's a damned suspicious action to take. It may not be a violation of Neutral Play, but that's not the reason for which they'd kill you.<br><br>Now let me be undeniably clear: We are NOT changing the Neutral Play rules on this, regardless of your opinion on how "fair" it is to either side.</cite></p>

Eg other character with pilot skill <strong>might</strong> wake up and <strong>might</strong> take the hunters down. Or not.</p><p>About beds, essential routines, Apron+Soap and piloting: I'd discussed all that, but it's not related to the current thread topic (I was only referring to that in sense of avoiding to place cameras on purpose, though it's just 2 AP and some MP and is easily regainable within 1-2 cycles, alongside with avoiding doing anything else before the selection happens, which is harmful for the ship in general, regardless of what team you’re in, if not digging too deep into details).</p><p><cite>there are 16 people on board, 14/16 in favor of human team!</cite>Well, mush can make additions to their team, while people can’t get them back on their side (besides just 1 person, which is even not always possible). Mush only need to destroy the ship and environment of the game itself is their helpful companion in that (hunters+o2 restrictions, random negative events), while humans have to survive and bring the ship at least to Sol, which is already a difficult thing to accomplish, not even mentioning the need to keep themselves safe from Mush, find those Mush and eliminate them. Plus from those 14 humans not all are active and thus functionable in the first place. But again, who is in a better position in general – Mush or Humans – or game is balanced for both teams - is a different topic from the current one.</p><p><cite>That is true, but you are just talking about a potential huge advantage for the mush team, which is unlikely though. </cite> Exactly. Potential = opportunity. Giving a benefit = giving an opportunity to act beneficially for your team. Taking that opportunity or not is another question. Neutral rules exist to balance the opportunities for both teams, providing a fair start of the play, which was exactly what I was referring to.</p><p>BD without a Camera = mush gets an opportunity to spike an active and important player (pilot/tech/..), who is supposed to stay in protected area, without any extra efforts. Mush doesn’t need to re-enter the room in order to infect – they can extract-&gt; enter BD to wash and infect. And they won’t even reveal themselves by taking down the camera. Which can stay uninstalled for several cycles, even (I’ve had such ships), -&gt; more than enough time to coordinate. But just an opportunity to spike a dorm character freely is already a lot, even without converting. Plus, getting even just one more mush right off the bat is already a huge advantage, and that you can handle either with infector on your own or with the help of mush partner if you don't have the skill, and you don’t have to be online at the same time for that. 3 mush = opportunity to convert a human per day. And, having a beta who is not under suspicion could be half-a-win for a mush team, even if both alphas get killed later on. <br>PS: about easy targets in unprotected rooms – those are usually idlers/useless players, while potential victims in dorms are a helpful asset to the mush team.</p>

Otherwise, the Developers wouldn't bother themselves with putting them there in the first place, if they wouldn't want the ship to be more or less damaged when the mush selection happens. Nonetheless, starting hunters usually end up shot as soon as first pilot awakens.</p><p>Personally, I think all those pre-selection stuff are here to keep crew occupied before the real game begins. Shooting hunters, looking for cameras and installing them, looking for apron, pots, soap, etc. researching lenses - of course, if the Developers wanted us to have those stuff in order when the game really starts they could just put those things on their places, have the cameras installed, lenses in one of the bays and whatnot. But what would the first crewmembers do for those first cycles and even days? If the ship would be prepared in optimal state, would they feel like they can actually make any impact before the selection on how the game turns out? Would they even bother to communicate and choose skills?</p>
