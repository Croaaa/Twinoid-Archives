                <p>While I do appreciate the change from Finola and Chao to Derek and Andie and back again, it slowly starts feeling like recycling and it's time to have a new pair of characters to enter the void. While I am fully aware that the suggestion will very likely be ignored, I still would like to put my thoughts to letters so they can stop keeping my head busy. Who knows, maybe some of the things could come to fruition one day.</p><p>Before I begin, I would like to add that I haven't thought of how two more characters would end up on the ship since in games it's always "form follows function" and here I would like to suggest functions.</p><p><strong>Character 1: Nils Carlson</strong>? (or any other name if Twinoid already got plans for him)</p><p>I feel like technology like drones are not being useful enough even if there is an active Terrence aboard and tons of scrap. Terrence usually ends up being a full time technician or pilot, while all those robot stuff is being neglected. I would like to see a character, who can actually be very useful not as a technician only, so here's the Terrence replacement's skillset:</p><p><strong>Level 1: Gadget Expert</strong> (or Gadgeteer)</p><p>Passive: Bonus on NERON projects (same as robotics expert)<br>Passive: Can create gadgets</p><p>Active: For 2 AP, 2 Plastic Scraps and 1 Scrap Metal the Gadgeteer can create a gadget (item), that can be attached to a character.</p><p>Attaching it costs another 1 AP, but can be done by anyone on anyone. Attaching is permanent and the character, the gadget is attached to, receives a status icon, that he is wearing a gadget, that is visible for everyone. No more than 1 gadget can be attached to a character.</p><p><strong>Gadget types:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Rocket Boots</strong>: Wearer receives 1 MP more from AP to MP conversion. Stacks with similar effects like scooter, sprinter etc.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Reinforced Knuckles</strong>: Melee attacks deal 1 additional point of damage. Adds 1 point of combat strength during expeditions. Stacks with similar effects.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Occular Enhancer</strong>: Adds 10% chance of hitting shots. Works with blaster (and other ranged weapons), turrets, patrol ships. Stacks with other similar effects.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Nano Healing Bot</strong>: Wearer recovers 1 additional HP per day.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Repair Helper</strong>: Adds 10% to the success rate of repairing equipment. Stacks with other similar effects.</li></ul><p>This skill makes sure that Plastic Scaps finally get some use as well. And it can considerably enhance the crew in time to be a lot more effective. While one or two gadgets might not make much difference, a fully gadgeted crew can be quite effective overall. The gadgets can be attached to character depending on their roles, helping the ship to adapt to different situations.</p><p><strong>Level 2: Designer</strong></p><p>This makes sure he can participate in projects, while being able to reserve some AP for his gadgets.</p><p><strong>Level 3: Technician</strong></p><p>This is a must for a Terrence replacement.</p><p><strong>Level 4: Tinkerer</strong></p><p>Passive: Dismanle, Reinforce and Strengthen actions cost 1 AP less.<br>Passive: Strengthen has a 20% increased success rate. (resulting in 95% success with wrench and oscilloscope)<br>Passive: +2-3% efficiency on fixing PILGRED (which is half of Physicist)<br>Passive: Dismantling certain items grants 1 additional Plastic Scrap.</p><p><strong>Level 5: Pilot</strong></p><p>This is to make sure he can also collect scraps. Being powerful in other areas he should not have the shooter skill.</p><p><strong>Level 6: Eidetic Memory</strong></p><p>Active: For 4 AP and once per game he can create a Blueprint of his choice, that he perfectly remembers from his studies.</p><p>Not sure, which blueprints exactly should be available as having 2 sofas each game sounds a bit too powerful, but a must would be an extinguisher blueprint to counter the set-on-fire-and-escape-on-Pasiphae-Mush-play. Probably just all non-weapon blueprints - this way there would be no second tube. But not only against Mush, this could fill the holes if the ship is missing important blueprints like Babel Module or Oscilloscope.</p><p>Character 2 will follow shortly.</p>

                <p><strong>Character 2: Sherman Lockwood</strong> (Sher Lock - get it?)</p><p>Following his name, this should be a replacement for Eleesha. I kind of imagine this guy be a true detective, who loves to solve cases but with a spleen that he sees them as fun, ignoring all seriousness. But then, as soon as stuff gets real, he is completely in over his head. He is basically the contrary of Derek: while Derek is unable to find the bad guys, but once they're found he can easily kill them, Sherman can find the evildoers but is completely unable to do anything against them. So, his skillset:</p><p><strong>Level 1: Analytical Coward</strong></p><p>While Eleesha is observant, being able to tell things after they happened, Sherman is able to predict things before they happen by analyzing the situation.</p><p>Passive: When using the Search action Sherman marks a room. All secret and covert actions in this room will become public for Sherman (no one besides him sees the entries). Only one room can be marked at the same time and using Search in another room will move the mark to the current room.<br>Passive: When a secret or covert action happens in such a room, Sherman will receive the "Panicking" status (visible to everyone when clicking on Sherman). The status will stay until Sherman has searched another room. "Panicking" will cause everything he writes in the public chat to appear in capital letters and end with "!!".</p><p>While this skill might not be able to catch a Mush every time, it will sure force the Mush to avoid rooms Sherman walked through, since they don't know which one of them is marked. The Mush also won't know immediately if they have been revealed or not. Furthermore it gives the game a fun-factor since the panic can also trigger from simple things as eating, possibly raising an unnecessary alarm by a human until Sherman verified which action it was. It kind of becomes a "The Lying Shepard" child story scenario. The Mush could coordinate to try and find the room by 1 Mush staying near Sherman to watch if his status appear and the other hiding some object with the excuse of just wanting to make a dangerous object unavailable for Mush. There might come different things to experiment with this skill.</p><p><strong>Level 2: Tracker</strong></p><p>A must-have as Eleesha's replacement - Sherman should also be able to print THE List.</p><p><strong>Level 3: Storyteller</strong></p><p>Passive: Able to use "Brag" action once per day. After the first dead Mush "Brag" turns into "Tell story".</p><ul><li><strong>Active (before 1 dead Mush)</strong>: <br>For 2 AP Sherman tells everyone in the room about how awesome it will be to find out the Mush and about his genius plans to make it happen and how he will totally outwit them. No one can take Sherman seriously. As the humans (except himself) think "Oh shit, we're screwed having this guy as our detective", they lose 2 morale, while the Mush's present in the room will have their next action cost 2 AP more.</li><li><strong>Active (after 1 dead Mush)</strong>:<br>For 2 AP Sherman tells everyone in the room about how he alone was able to get a Mush killed, which will raise the Morale of every human (including Sherman) by 2.</li></ul><p>As the Mush tend to do things in one go, this will make sure to harm their burst exploits, no matter what their plans are. It will certainly harm earlygame plays but in the long run, the humans would lose too much morale if Sherman does it every day. But this skill before dead Mush might give the humans just enough time to finish important researches while after 1 dead Mush it can become a viable source of morale to make up for the early uses.</p><p><strong>Level 4: Nurse</strong></p><p>Being a worrywart Sherman of course knows how to treat wounds.</p><p><strong>Level 5: Firefighter</strong></p><p>Sherman is also afraid to burn alive, so he knows how to extinguish fires.</p><p><strong>Level 6: Wanton Imagination</strong></p><p>Active: For 6 AP Sherman will dive deep into his imagination and roleplay a Mush for 3 cycles (visible in public chat). He can see and communicate in the Mush chat (including recent spikes) and can see whether or not people have spores on them, but not how many. During this time he will not be able to see or write in the public chat (like having to talkie), even with brainsynch. No one can invite him into a private chat, even when in the same room. When the 3 cycles end, he can behave as usual.</p><p>Okay, this skill miiiight need some reworking but I wasn't able to come up with a decent skill that fits his character at level 6 for now. Maybe someone else gets a better idea - generally I would be aiming for a skill that can benefit with and without Mush onboard.</p><p>Phew, that was time consuming. I hope you like those!</p><p>Greetz,<br>res7less</p>

The big no for me though is the 'present humans lose two moral for 2 AP spent' that's basically Demoralize in form of a human skill and I wouldn't want to be the shrink of that creep. Whenever intentionally because mush/griefer or unintentionally depriving a room full with people of two moral each is out of the question... I'd grab a knife and stab you.</cite><p>Doesn't Leader do the same with the difference that Leader can be used as often as one likes? If not, the self-morale-thing can be removed, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. That's why I put the restriction "once per day" there.</p><p>Considering the minus morale, what you said is not a bad thing, it's actually a good thing. Many skills and items in the game can be used for good and for bad, so having a skill that can be also used as Mush makes it a good within the game concept. Even Ceasefire which is meant to protect, can be used by Mush to protect them - this is how it meant to be.</p>
