                <p>I had been alpha Mush Jin-Su on the ship together with Ian. Around day 4-5 we have secretly turned to Mush also Finola. I have taken Anonymush and nobody seemed notice. After that Ian had to die for some of his obvious mistakes. Unfortunately after that we didn't managed to spike anyone as the crew was very careful.</p><p>Now it's day 9. Crew doing great and actually seem capable of reaching Eden. We are just sitting tight and waiting for some opportunity to strike. There were some ideas, but that's not relevant to the case. Suddenly I am getting log message about Finola dying and I am invited to private channel with 4 days long history full of mush hunting.</p><p>In overall I have to applaud to human team to trick me like that. I knew that something doesn't fit, because there was only 1 Mush icon up there and no other else. Even faking that Neron message by Janice was very nice. I was really convinced I am safe now and once they finish PILGRED, I will just go for Sol and it's win. Really nice job, people <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway I have strong belief that Finola worked against me with Human team, worked on Serum and asked to be turned back. There is no other explanation currently and I want to ask, if this is reportable. <strong>I would like to hear some opinion on this before actually sending report.</strong></p><p>PS: Is there some way how to make somebody in Patrol ship to forcefully land ? I was in the ship before I went for IRL sleep and then in the morning I see message "Jin Su 's patrol ship has just landed.". How is that possible ?</p>

                <p>Playing against your team is strictly against the rules. If Finola was working with the human team, that is reportable. File your report, and we'll take a look at it after the ship is over.</p><p>The reason you were forced to land is because Magnetic Net is enabled. The ship moved, and you were returned to the bay. They could have turned off the Magnetic Net before moving the ship, and you would have died instantly.</p>

                <p>Thanks. Report sent.</p><p>It's not like I am certain about this. Could have been they have finished Serum secretly and used it on Finola. However that's quite hard without Finola's help to finish that thing. According to last messages, it was around 30% or so. That would mean that Finola as the Mush have been working on that quite extensively. Solely this could be considered anti-team play as she didn't told me about it at all.</p><p>I am not going to freak about this. I had fun, that's true. Just seems unfair to me and if I am right, I would like to see apology here from the player of Finola. Or at least explanation what really happened there.

                <p>Ok, if that's really true, then I have to applaud to you all once more. You have played me over quite well. I was mainly confused because Finola haven't said a thing on the Mush channel for like 2 days. That was my main lead for this report. From my point of view it really looked like she had seen the desperation of that situation and wanted to become human again.</p>

                <p>I played Kuan on the ship in question. It has just ended with us going back to sol. Unfourtunately, by the time we had rooted out the mush we didn't have enough time to get the star map pieces. I will just give my account as i worked with Finola to finish (or almost finish) the cure. Hopefully this will answer some of your questions.</p><p>After Ian had been killed on day 3 we printed the list on day 5. I had Eleesha keep it secret for obvious reasons and she accepted as i had previously been cleared by the xyloph list. On the list was the following: Raluca, Jin Su, Finola, Janice and Paola. From here we started a small task force to figure out who was the fungus. At it was first Eleesha, Gioele and me. Eleesha because she already knew the contents of the list and was not on it, Gioele because he had been vomiting all over the rear corridor and of course me because of the Xyloph list. Pretty soon we invited Terrence as well as he was not on the list either and was very effective at killing hunters and repairing stuff.</p><p>With this group we first discounted Finola as a suspect as she had been pretty effective with anti mush research. In fact we almost brought her in, but opted not to due to things like forgetting to drop the apron and finishing anti-spore gas during cycle 1 instead of cycle 8.</p><p>Janice claimed to be on her first ship and asked for a lot of advise and generally did what was asked. She was however also not brought in at first as she could had many chances to spike me while we worked on neron projects, and at the time when we printed the list seemed very eager to get me in there again. To clear Janice, we completed the Myco Scanner, and when i was found to be clean we concluded that she was not mush, and she was invited to the task force.</p><p>We were now down to three suspects and we Opted to take out raluca as PILGRED was around 80% and she had some strange movement patterns. Thus, we figured we would be able to finish PILGRED without her. Sadly she was quite human. I feel that the mush missed an opertunity to incite a riot here. If you had acted on this i believe you could have gotten Gioele killed as he actually took out Raluca by himself.</p><p>We are now left with Paola and Jin as suspect. Paola started out by getting all the signal but has been inactive for some time and we figure if we make the cure we can give it to Jin and kill Paola if it fails. However Paola suddenly becomes active again and starts acting very wierd. Thus the plan flip flops and we plan on giving the cure to paola again. Around here i contact Finola to get work done on the cure. I tell her the plan to administer the cure (but not about the list). My thinking is that she plans to take the anonymush skill when Jin is killed. She told me after being turned back that Jin suggested that she sacrificed herself to keep him hidden. I don't know about other people, but that wouldn't fly with me either.</p><p>At this point she is still not a suspect, so we work on the cure and she sleeps in the medlab. She tells me that she used the myco scanner and that she has a single spore, so it is still safe to sleep in there. The next day i suddenly see her in bravo dorm, and i ask her what that is about. She tells me that she now has two spores and she no longer dares to sleep in the medlab. Wanting to find out who spiked her i check the medlab logs to see who's been in there. It turns out, no one was in there at the same time as her. Next i check the lab and here i see that she has not been in the lab between telling me she had one spore and telling me she had two spores. Suddenly, everything is turned upside down and Finola is now the main suspect and we pretty much exhonerate both Paola and Jin. That plan has obviously now changed to giving the serum to Finola, but we also need her to help finish it as progress with out her is abysmal. I keep talking to Finola and reiterate that i am really in doubt about who of Jin and Paola is the mush. But as long as i tell her that i intend to give the serum to Paola, i figure she'll play along. In my last session with Finola we get the serum up to 95% and she runs out of AP (or refuse to work on it) and she returns to bravo dorm. I gather the task force and we devise a plan to get the cure the last 5% and administer it to Finola in bravo dorm within the very next cycle. We suspected an alternate plan was to finish the drug herself, steal it and possibly administer it to someone else. It took three people and like 12-14 AP between us to get the serum completed and take it to Bravo dorm as without Finola we were stuck at increasing it 1% at a time.</p><p>So there you have it. The not so short story about how Finola was free from the grasp of the mush. Long story short, we told her that we would be giving the serum to Paola, which was indeed the plan until Finola inadvertently gave herself away</p>

                <p>Eleesha here. I can testify with absolute certainty that Finola did not secretly help us or ask be be saved. It all came undone after we caught a little lie of hers which confirmed suspicion. Me, Kuan Ti, and Gioele made a daring plan to finish the serum quickly and cure her. Even at that time, we suspected you, Jin, but we weren't dead sure.</p>

Since I was Anonymush, you would think she was last Alpha and everything would be fine. After that you would have finished PILGRED, I would fly to Sol with you and would be nice Mush win. Oh well, too bad she didn't understood this plan <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>You're very welcome. It was a very fun game. I would have hoped that we would do better after we finished all the mush, but it was apparently no mean to be.</p><p>As for you plan to sacrifice Finola, it would only have worked because she was on the list. Had she not been on the list we would have been able to deduce that while she was mush, she was not the other alpha. You had no way of knowing whether this was the case. Thus it would actually have made more sense for you to sacrifice yourself and have her pick anonymush at the same time. Either way, you could have opted to go out with a bang, which would probably have been my choice. If the two of you spend a bit of time collecting AP, you could easily have taken out two or three players in one fell swoop, leaving the ship severely crippled. Had you for example taken out Terrence and Chao, we would have been left with no pilots.</p><p>Finally. Thank you for a good game. You did a fair job keeping yourself hidden. It was only the list that got us onto your scent. And even that was quickly dismissed when we caught on to Finola.</p>

                <p>For know, i feel bad, because i didn't know what happened after my death. Actually, i was trying to slow everything down and communicate, but i think i was too suspicious. Thanks to Jin Su that helped me, and he was great team leader. And this game was really intresting. It's so hard to hide from so good and active team.

                <p>Hello, I was Finola.</p><p>As Krangor told you, I didn't asked to be cured with the serum.<br>But you know that we were in a dead end : I couldn't stop working or slowing down too much because that's how we found Ian, and I couldn't get officially dirty.</p><p>I made a mistake by sleeping in the bravo dorm, because that night I spared a lot of PA, extracted two spores and had to shower, and I thought my little story of being spiked again would be fine. You had doubts about Paola and I did that when she woke up, so you could kill/cure her.</p><p>But you were good investigator, and as long as I thought you didn't have doubts about me, especially because I found the first mush before being turned, I had no reason to stop working on the serum.</p>
