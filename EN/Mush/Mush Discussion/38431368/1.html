                <p>Finola was OP, maybe even at Bronze, and I'm glad she's gone. No character completely dedicated to Research makes ships a lot more interesting.</p><p>But how could they do this to Chao? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> Torture was great, but only if you knew how to use it. And Hyperactive is so restrictive, you could hardly argue that he was unbalanced. Mush-hunting as Derek just isn't the same, and I'm not even sure its just because of the skill differences. Bring back Chao!</p><p>As far as high-level Mush go, the more of those of you see, the more Observant Eleeshas and Confidante Andies pop up too. Right now, even many low-effort ships can take care of the Mush. I <em>hope</em> that changes as Mush get stronger, but the smarter ships will still probably win nine times out of ten.</p>

                <p>I really don't get that hate towards Andie. I just ended the ship where I played her. With Pilot, Polyvalent and Devotion. We only made it to day 6 return on Sol, but god, I was doing everything - research, expeditions, shooting hunters, fighting mushes... you just name it. With anyone else I would be complaining about not having enough APs for all those stuff. But with Andie's Devotion? If you have active captain and can gain his trust, it's almost like playing Lethargy Chun. Or even better, because you don't have to wait and hope for some magebook - you already are pilot and researcher on top of that. It's one of those few characters I'm really looking forward to play again <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I don't really like Finola all that much and I don't miss her one bit. Sure she has quite some research power <em>if she isn't bronze</em> but if you compare bronze-versions Andie beats her flat out in usefulness. And personally I had a lot of fun <em>being</em> him. <br>Sure, polyvalant is a must. (I especially saved the xp for it before the update.) As having an Andie without Polyvalant might screw the game but so does not having a technician or Hua being the only pilot. Or to many frozen brains. There are so many ways a game can be screwed blaming it on Andie is just mean. <br> <br>But I agree on the Chao part. Aside from the skills I really missed his lunatic behaviour.</p><p>Our ship failed in the mush hunt part. And I guess with torturer (or maybe just an active Chun) things would have gone differently but the research got done.... until I was turned..</p>

                <p>I got better idea. Derec`s treat "Borring speaker" - every turn random player with Derec in room will lose 1 <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/moral.png" alt=":mush_moral:" class="tid_ico">. Something like Raluca`s treat inverse. And it give some nice roleplay and mush hunting gameplay.</p>

                <p><cite> this is balance fix to prevent fast researching rush.</cite></p><p>And I've told you that you are outright wrong, as Finola and Chao are not disabled. It's not a balance patch, it's a poorly thought-out character.</p><p><cite>Roland (50%, never if n00b) Jin Su (30% or so), Freida (20% or so) Terrence (30% or so)</cite></p><p>Roland 50%? Pffffhahahahahaha.</p><p>More like:</p><p>Hua - 100%<br>Roland - 95%<br>Jin su - 50-70%<br>Frieda - 20% (100% if you have a silver frieda)<br>Terrance - 40-50%</p><p>That is, on average, three pilots. Granted, copying pilot isn't always a bad move, but honestly I'd probably yell at you if there was more than two pilots and you didn't copy <em>shrink</em>.</p><p><cite>Honestly, Poly Andie is as good as Biologist Ian, but you know what ? Only 25 % of my ships or less even have a biologist Ian, ( I roll Botanist/Green Thumb Ian myself), so your really only down in research capacity if you would otherwise have Biologist and Medic Fiona, which was also less than half of my ships, on average.</cite></p><p>Ahem. I think you are missing a very important point. <strong>Piloting is extremely <em>AP</em> Intensive</strong>. An Andie who is <em>using</em> his pilot skill will not be doing research <strong>at all</strong>. Ian, even if he isn't a biologist, will have AP to spare after his plants in the early days.That makes him a member of the normal research team by default, right along with Chun.</p><p>That said, <strong>This discussion isn't about Andie VS Ian. This is a discussion about Andie VS Finola.</strong> If Andie replaced Ian your argument might hold water, as it is it does not really.</p><p><cite>I'm gonna say its 95 % + of diplomat's power, as i have never seen the active use of Diplo make any difference in a real game. Yes, a Finola with two research boosting skills is better than Andie with a single skill, but most Finola's only have one of those skills, so its kinda not a relevant comparison. It IS cool when it happens, though, just like when a Tech/Phy Raluca shows up. Personally, i did like Finola, and I DONT like Derek at all, but they don't follow my advice on what new characters to use</cite> That is fair, ceasefire needs to be more useful.</p><p>If we are comparing two characters, we need to compare them on equal grounds. There will be just as many gold/silver/bronze andies as there are gold/silver/bronze finolas. You need to compare them with equal status and level.</p><p>Bronze Comparison</p><p>Andie - Pilot (Level 1 Andie)<br>-Not doing research at all. Probably never in the lab<br>Finola - Biologist (Level 1 Finola)<br>-Better outright than pilot Andie,</p><p>Bronze Level 1 Finola is better for the ship.</p><p>Andie - Polyvariant (Level 3 Andie)<br>-About as good as Finola in the lab, has diplomat for expos<br>Finola - Medic<br>-Equal to Andie in the lab (Worth 1AP per heal in effective health gained) and can do surgery(<em>Important!</em>).</p><p>Silver Comparison<br>Andie V1 - Pilot/Devoted<br>-Still sucks just as hard for doing his job. 3rd/4th string pilot that we don't need.</p><p>Andie V2 - Pilot/Poly<br>-As good as a <em>bronze</em> Finola in the lab, and can fly as backup. Of course, if you are flying you won't have AP for research so...<br>-Oh yes, and they are very good on expos. Wonderful. Expos != doing their main job.</p><p>Andie V3 - Poly/Devoted (<em>the only acceptable version of andie</em>)<br>-30-40% weaker than Silver Finola on average all things equal. The only way Poly/Devoted can out-perform Finola is by sucking up <strong>every</strong> mission on the ship. This, of course, means that nobody else gets missions.</p><p>Finola V1 - Biologist/Medic<br>-Outright better than Andie at their primary job, everything else being equal</p><p>Finola V2 - Medic/Nurse<br>-Equal to a Poly Andie in the lab, has gains an effective 6AP/day in points (4AP from two heal actions, 2 effective additional AP from medic heal values)</p><p>Finola V3 - Medic/Diplomat<br>-Slightly weaker than <em>the best</em> Silver Andie overall. Poly/Devoted Andie has better research potential if they are getting missions. Marginally worse than Andie on expos as they don't get +1 fruit. Finola also has <strong>Germaphobe</strong> making expos tricky for her.</p><p>Gold Comparison<br>Andie - Pilot/Poly/Devoted/Confidant<br>-Overall a decent character in her own right. 30-40% weaker in the lab, slightly stronger on expos (one extra fruit). Of course, Pilot isn't that helpful unless your Roland/Hua/Terrance/Jin Su aren't doing their jobs.</p><p>Finola - Biologist/Medic/Nurse/Diplomat<br>-Much, much better than Andie in the lab, marginally worse on expos. Nurse is a fantastic and underrated skill late ship. (<em>As an anecdote, in my current ship (on day 11) I'm spending about 8-10AP/day healing the crew as Gioele. Finola would spend 4-6AP doing the same job, do it much more efficiently, and would be able to do sugary.</em>)</p><p>Overall, Andie and Finola are pretty equal in <strong>overall</strong> power level. The problem is <strong>Andie replaces the ship's primary researcher</strong> which <strong>severely hurts your ship as a whole</strong>.</p>

IN some of those I was a non-detatched Raluca who had to spend time in a room with others! Raising morale isn't difficult if you focus on keeping it high and know how to raise it after a rampage!)

It's one of <strong>the</strong> best investigation tools on the ship short of the list. Mycoalarms, ASG, Constispispore Serum... I mean hell <strong>Pheromodem</strong> is considered <em>Gamebreakingly strong</em> by some for the Mush hunt.

                <p>Jamini, I've been pretty much been playing as Andie since the start, and I've managed to get Antispore done and finished on day 1 both times. So I personally think this is just an issue with players, and not the character itself.</p>

Its like right at the launch of Mush, when you had only around 50 % chance of a Tech and every getting the Sofa, so I feel your pain. Over the first season, I NEVER had a Finola without at least Biologist or Medic, and often they had both, about 50 % of the time as well.</p>

                <p>What it bothers e is that they are just gone, while it would be interesting to see them switching around. Yes the new character needs some rebalacement, but I think it's plain stupid to just get rid of the new one.</p><p>Wouldn't be fun to have a roster of character who you totally don't know who can come next? Like lists, 16 slots and every slot can be occupied by X, Y, or Z character.</p><p>Now it's like "You liked play Chao and Finola? Too bad, have these mediocre guys instead, period."</p><p>Derek is incredibly useless, and Andie...well, his third skill seems OP in Explorations, but it's too mild in helping research while Finola could really be useful. These things are multiplied by the fact you cannot just try the new guys, you are force to play with them, so when they are bad you really feel cheated.</p>
