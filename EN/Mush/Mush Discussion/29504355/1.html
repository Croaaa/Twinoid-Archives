                <p>This game is extremely fun when you get to have 2 or more skills, but pretty much cripples you with only 1 free to play slot. Now I get why it was made like this. Companies want their money after all, but what will be the point of leveling up if you are going to stay a free to play player forever? If you only have one skill slot, you will almost never get the opportunity to use a skill you acquired later, because most characters can't work without their first skill choice. It's simply essential to have that skill for you to do your job. If Chun, for example, doesn't take her first skill, everyone will lose 2 morale a day, which would be overkill. If Frieda doesn't take her first skill, she won't be as effective in planet scans...and since she needs those to earn glory, she will have to use it. That applies to almost every character.<br>With things looking like this, I think it will take all this leveling up fun away from people who wouldn't pay to win. After all, what's the point of having additional skills if you have to use the default anyway? It's kinda disappointing that you will be left out on all the fun.<br>I suppose being mush won't be all that glorious either. Only one skill will probably not leave you with much of a choice. But you at least aren't forced to take the same skill all the time. Unlike human players.</p><p>Also, because you will only have to have one skill, certain characters with a rather boring primary skill will be characters no one wants to play. I am talking about Stephen, Gioele and Terrence.<br>While Gioele doesn't need his primary skill (because it almost never seems to serve any purpose), he could easily take one of his level up options, but those aren't all that breathtaking as far as I could see (I haven't unlocked them all, though). I am not sure if Stephen needs his cooking skill, because he will hardly use it anyway. Does he need it for glory? If not, why take it? He will be lucky if he gets an interesting secondary skill he will get to use instead.<br>Terrence appears to be a VERY fun character to play...if you got 2 or more skill slots. With only his primary skill available, you will find yourself to be bored easily. If you are lucky enough for someone to bring in scrap metal and you actually manage to find your drone and pick it up, you might actually get to do something every once in a while. In contrast to characters like Roland or Frieda, who can fulfill their primary objective almost all the time. As far as I know, Terrence can't even dismantle stuff for scrap without the technician skill and that skill is NOT a primary skill for anyone. So if you won't be lucky and get a player with two skill slots AND a technician ability, you are going to have a hard time, right?<br>Furthermore, technician appears to be far more useful than Terrence's primary skill, because repairing stuff is what you will have to do almost all the time, yet Terrence can't abandon his first skill, because he needs it to earn glory. If he favors technician over his primary skill, he might actually be helpful to the team, but ends up losing all his chances of ever getting into the ranking. That's something only very few people would do, since they want to be listed as one of the best players, right?</p><p>Speaking of which. Is it really equally hard to get a certain score in the ranking? Roland can shoot the crap outta hunters almost any time, while other characters only get glory for killed mush players. I know that Roland will eventually get less and less glory for each kill, but won't he still get more than a character who needs mush assassinations? I can easily see him and Frieda dominating the leaderboards in the future. At least that's my theory.</p><p>Well, that's what's on my mind. Feel free to point out where I am wrong, if I am. I tend to over think stuff easily.</p>

                <p>I don't think it's fair to call this pay to win. You only have to buy gold mode <em>once</em> in order to unlock the extra slots for life. It's not like Die2Nite where hero mode gives you a HUGE advantage over residents, and you have to renew every time you run out of hero days or you lose all your abilities.</p><p>One month of gold on Mush is only 10 Euros. If someone is not willing to pay that to support a game they enjoy and intend to play a lot, I don't think the devs are under any obligation to cater to them. Free to play games are not charity. I think they are being pretty generous by letting you permanently unlock those slots by playing. The other temporary perks from buying gold are not significant enough to have a major impact on the game.</p>

Well, crap. There goes my whole argument. Still, one extra free slot for life is still pretty good. Plus this is a game where there is no outside organization allowed, so there won't be groups of paying players banding together to dominate the game (except for the castings, but those don't really count). You probably do need at least 2 skills to be competitive though, so might as well pay the 10 Euros and get the free slot, yeah? Support the devs so they can keep making awesome games like this. You're probably already playing several of their other games for free anyway.</p><p>This same topic came up when D2N came out and they said that there was absolutely no way that they would change the cost of hero days (which I think is ridiculously high, but that hasn't stopped me from buying 6 months at least 3 times now). I think I might have even been the one to start that topic. However it all ended up coming down to the fact that I felt like it was worth it to spend that kind of cash to get the extra benefits while playing a very unique game with some great people. I can see Mush being that kind of experience and will probably spend the money again because it is worth it to me.</p>

That is part of the Welcome Package which I can't see on the english page so far.</cite> I assume that the iTrackie will be part of the Gold package, just like it is in the French version. Note that the current pseudo-Gold mode that we have during these beta tests is very similar to what happened for a while in the French version: separate talkie and tracker (as without Gold mode) but all 4 skill slots available (as in Gold mode) and a visual bug that shows the 2nd skill slot as locked although it isn't. This happened during the French beta and the iTrackie appeared later. I assume that we will have the same here.</p><br><p>As this topic is about leveling up and not so much about paying, one important thing needs to be said: as long as you have more available skills for a character than open skill slots, you have the opportunity to choose your skills. So if you have only one slot available (basic player who has never paid for the Gold mode) but you are playing a character that you have already leveled up a bit, then you can choose what skill you put there. If you have paid at least once but you let your Gold mode expire, then you will be allowed to choose two skills.</p><p>Leveling up can be very interesting because some high-level skills are useful. Some of them are more useful in combination with other skills so they may not be the best choice for those who have only one slot open, but others are very interesting on their own and could be used by those who have never paid for this game.</p>

Being able to do more than the basics/what everyone else does, have skills that improve you, make you better than others because they lack that, just because you payed-be it once, twice, fifty times-is what pay2win means. You win the 'game' because you payed, there is no twisting this around, it is what is it is, and if it really is what it is, than I'm really disappointed, I hope it isn't like as such, and that we at least get one extra space and that silver members get the third one available and the gold members get all four, because then there's not such an unfair advantage.</strong> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif" alt=":drpg_twinlove:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I think the same about the die2nite model. The only reason it works for me is because the people creating the MT games actually care about the gameplay and not just try to rob you blind with elaborate schemes.<br>That doesn't make the payment model any better, but it justifies it enough for me.<br> <br>I played a little bronze mode in french, but the language barrier was just too much to have an opinion about it. If you say that the game is enjoyable with 1 skill slot, and you can be a valuable member of the crew then I'm happy with that!</p>

                <p>I just think f2p players will be missing out on too much. Seeing as they won't get any skills and thus are very restricted in what they can do. This + inactivity will surely kill the fun for a lot of players. If you end up choosing a f2p character, you will be very dependent on the rest of the crew...but since I can see that many people aren't really playing this game actively enough even in the beta, I guess I will have a hard time really enjoying this for a long time. I probably will get bored soon and quit. There is nothing worse than having nothing to do in combination of a semi-dead ship.<br>I know, this sounds just like I am whining so you will probably think "Go then, no one will miss you", but surely I can't be the only one. I just think there could have been a better way to make money out of this game and still let the f2p players have a bit of the fun this game has to offer.<br>I just know for sure, that I will probably never play certain characters once the beta ends and gold mode expires. It's just not worth it, which really is a shame. Seems like Roland (with pilot), Hua, Frieda and maybe a couple of others are the way to go, while characters like Stephen, Terrence or Gioele (unless leveled up to a certain skill level) will be the ones no one will want to play.</p>

But then again, this broken model also isn't completely broken, it lets you keep some bonuses if you've payed once... So if you get screwed over with a bad ship or three full of inactives, you're not completely screwed over...

Or develop a soft spot for it despite the barebonesness of the damn thing.</p><p>Best, business, model, ever. <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/pa_core.png" alt=":mush_pa_core:" class="tid_ico"></p>

Isn't that the point of the game, everyone being random people aboard a ship trying to survive/figure out who's the Mush?</cite> Don't worry about that. Even if you join a "private" ship as part of a casting, you will not know who is who. For the low-level castings, the system is designed so that you cannot just start one ship with 16 players. You are required to start two ships simultaneously and the players who are "ready" are distributed at random between the two ships and are also assigned to random characters. This random assignment ensures some level of anonymity and it is also a trick to encourage players to try other characters instead of always leveling up the same character and ignoring the other ones.</p>

It's not like they're locked in to only ever using the same skill over and over and over and over.</cite><p>Let's see who of the characters actually can afford taking a different skill:</p><p><strong>Jin Su</strong>: Leader. He doesn't need that skill to gain glory, yes. I am not sure if the other players would appreciate you not choosing that skill, though. That's a useful moral refill skill. Especially if Janice is inactive or mush<br><strong>Frieda</strong>: Astrophysicist. No way in hell would she choose anything else. I don't know what her lvl 6 skill does, but scanning planets is her job AND she gains glory from it. A player would be stupid not to choose this.<br><strong>Kuan Ti:</strong> Architect. I suppose he could drop this one for technician or astrophysicist. But why would he, really? Advancing projects is in his best interest. Not only does it grant the crew bonuses, it also gives him glory.<br><strong>Janice</strong>: Shrink. Essential. No questions asked, moving on.<br><strong>Roland:</strong> Sprinter. Nice bonus, but not necessary. Everyone would probably drop it for pilot, because it works better in gaining glory with him. Plus, it gives bonuses for neron projects and helps the crew more on the long run.<br><strong>Hua</strong>: pilot. She could drop this for botanist or survivor, but you won't really need two botanists on board and only having the survivor thing as a skill would be boring. Technician could be useful, but Hua probably would want to take part in most expeditions, so she should have something that helps with them. Technician does not. Dunno what her last skill is.<br><strong>Paola</strong>: Radio Expert. She will definately need this as the main comms officer on board. Nothing else really compares. Again, I do not know her last skill.<br><strong>Chao</strong>: Shooter. I have no idea what this character is about and how he gains glory. I suppose he is a mush hunter/killer, so he could probably take whatever he wants.<br><strong>Finola</strong>: Biologist. I am not sure, but I think she gains glory by finishing researches. biologist appears to be the best choice for that. It's also in the ships interest to finish researches fast. Being a biologist would be most helpful in achieving that. Though, granted, I have no idea what her other skills do. Haven't played her yet.<br><strong>Stephen</strong>: cook. Seems to be useless. I guess Stephen could use anything he wants. I have no idea what his glory gain condition is.<br><strong>Ian</strong>: Biologist. I will be honest here. I know how he is supposed to gain glory, but he will always have a hard time gaining any, so he probably doesn't even has to bother too much with that. Having someone to treat the plants is helpful, but if he thinks a different choice would be better, I wouldn't blame him. Especially if he uses biologist and helps out Finola.<br><strong>Chun</strong>: Humanity's last hope. Without it, everyone loses 2 morale a day. People will hate you if you won't choose this.<br><strong>Raluca</strong>: Physicist. Essential in repairing the pilgred. Unless you know you will have a couple of technicians around, which you simply can't beforehand, you really can't choose anything else without dooming the whole ship. Who will finish pilgred but her?<br><strong>Gioele</strong>: solid. A useless skill for a useless character. He could, indeed, choose whatever the heck he wants. No one expects much from him anyway.<br><strong>Eleesha</strong>: Tracker. An investigation skill. It's not exactly useless, but you could ague if IT expert wouldn't be a better choice. The bonuses of Tracker aren't that groundbreaking in all honesty.<br><strong>Terrence</strong>: robotics expert. He needs this for glory, even though it isn't all that great a skill. Still, I am assuming most people would play to be on top of their ship's and the global ranking, so you will pretty much be forced to choose this.</p><p>Summing up:</p><p>Characters who simply have to use the first skill:</p><p>Frieda<br>Janice<br>Paola<br>Chun<br>Raluca<br>Terrence</p><p>Characters who sorta have to choose the first skill because it really would be better for them and the whole ship:</p><p>Jin Su<br>Kuan Ti<br>Finola<br>Hua</p><p>Characters who can choose whatever the heck they want:</p><p>Roland<br>Chao<br>Stephen<br>Ian<br>Gioele<br>Eleesha</p><p>So in the end, you are free to choose your favorite skill only if you end up playing 6 of the total 16 characters, 10 if you are willing to risk getting frowned upon.</p><p>So in my opinion, you can't say players aren't forced to play the same way every time as f2p players. Most players will end up choosing the first skill. Every time.</p>

                <p><cite>Terrence: robotics expert. He needs this for glory, even though it isn't all that great a skill. Still, I am assuming most people would play to be on top of their ship's and the global ranking, so you will pretty much be forced to choose this.</cite></p><p>I don't know about the rest of your post, but I <em>sort of</em> disagree with this bit. Robotics expert is a pretty hard skill to actually use outside of NEXUS research, so someone using Terrence might be better off as a pilot or something if they actually want to gain Glory. If you're willing to ignore drones completely (which given Terrence's Disabled status, is a strategy that deserves a look) there are probably skills that will pay off often enough that it'd hardly matter if Terrence has his robotics skill or not. I won't go as far to say you're completely off the mark with this. Choosing anything else would basically make Drones useless for the whole game, so deciding to do that right off the bat doesn't sound like a possible choice, but if we're looking at it from Terrence's perspective only? Pilot could potentially have higher payoff in several situations.</p><p>That doesn't mean I'm not worried about this games paid features, though. I'm not completely sure what I would do about it myself, but I will admit I'm worried there's too little to do as a free player. It'd be nice if they could still open up a second skill slot but it just took them until level 7 or something, but that idea has its own drawbacks. I dunno. For now I'm not going to worry about it. We haven't much had a chance to try the game without paid features at all, so I'm not going to try to make too hard of a judgement on it until we do.</p>

                <p>You are right about Terrence. I am just not too sure how useful his drones actually are, so I was slightly reluctant to write the skill off, yet. I never got to see their usefulness ingame, because all Terrences I met were either inactive or mush. The one time I was Terrence myself, I couldn't upgrade drones because there was no scrap due to inactive crew members. I upgraded one twice, but the ship died before I could actually see them do something. Someone else said drones wouldn't even work properly on the French version. If that's true, then Terrence really could favor pilot over his robotic expert skill. It's kinda sad, though, that you will have to disregard a whole game feature and become yet another pilot. To be fair, the whole "build drones and upgrade them" concept sounded really nice. But it just doesn't seem to work when it comes down to it.<br> However...if you only end up playing Terrence for his pilot perk, everyone would still pick Hua or Roland over Terrence, since the other characters have no handicap in moving around the ship.</p>
