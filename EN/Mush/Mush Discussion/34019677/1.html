                <p>I'm having a problem distinguishing genuine new players from mush pretending to be new. I wouldn't go as far as saying that these mush are saying things like 'Hi i'm new', but they act ostensibly like they are completely clueless but once you uncover the full extent of their actions they turn out to be very experienced players.</p><p>Now, I don't really have a problem with mush pretending to be new, what gives me a problem is genuinely new people being accused (and often convicted) of being Mush. This must drive away a lot of players, and since this game is built on trickery and distrust it's hard to see a way around it.</p><p>Anyone else experienced this?</p>

                <p>Well, if a player does the tutorial, then they are definitely new. What's harder is if a player is trying a character for the first time, or has a job they don't know.</p><p>Also, a new player should learn once you tell them something. If they keep failing at the same thing, then if they are dealt with, it's their own fault. For instance, if a new Finola keeps not using the apron when told to, to do research. (I've had this in two games.) Then they are going to get killed. Learning that they have to be careful is part of the game.</p>

                <p>Honestly, I've had no problems with the new players, its the not-talking-but-doing-random-crap players that really make the hunt hard. All my captains on my last three ships had this, we eventually had enough of the random morale speeches and not launching the ship, and killed them all, and they were all human. On my current ship we had to go through 3 different 'captains' before we got one that was actually talking to us, so we knew some non-hacker ship moving was going to actually happen <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I just finished a ship in which one player was nearly killed by me, because they were dirty for several cycles, and without any cause given. They were an experienced player, and ultimately human, I should add, but the reasons they gave for <em>not</em> reporting being dirty were:</p><p>1. <em>There was no dirty thread yet,</em></p><p>2. People can lie in the dirty threads, and</p><p>3. <em>It was too much of a hassle to report being dirty.</em></p><p>While point 2 has some truth to it, this was still <strong>not</strong> a justifiable defense to me. But the crew didn't want to kill this player, and so they didn't assist me. This player did survive until our return to Sol. While it doesn't <em>quite</em> fall under griefing...it struck me as very odd, in that sense of "they should know far better than this". I've been on enough ships where being dirty and refusing to report it is something that can and <strong>will</strong> get you killed. It's just second nature to me by this point.</p><p>Then again, this is also a player who insisted that Mycoalarms should be the first research completed, <strong>instead</strong> of Antispore Gas. This player was adamant about it, and while I did admit it was a useful research to have, it was suboptimal. By Day 4, NO research had been completed, and here's why: We had a Chun who was inactive for most of the voyage, and Finola was Mush. Ian was inactive as well, taking up the Medlab bed. Paola was semi-active, but not very communicative. I also made the point that for the Mycoalarms to be most effective, you need an active Chun to run around the ship and hide them.</p>

                <p>I feel the dirty thread is actually detrimental to Mush's progress. For human will have no difference, but if Mush want to spore they will have to find an excuse to be dirty first before sporing. If there is no dirty thread its bad play on the human part, you should be creating one and giving people time to explain their dirty and not killing people just because they have been dirty. I usually just stay dirty until I'm going to do something that needs me to be clean.</p>

                <p>In this game, I find that it's best to give people the benefit of the doubt. Killing people is costly. I'd rather not kill on what they say but what they do.</p><p>But like Spazticus brought up, it's often wise to be preemptive about everything. Put up a dirty thread. Tell everyone how Nexus research works and that people who research the wrong thing can be shot. Tell people where not to go - nobody in engine room except Raluca, no Raluca in front of ship, anyone who enters the dorm with the shower is a suspect.</p>

                <p>I agree with MrMuz. In my first game I found out the hard way that killing people just for being dirty usually ends up killing more humans than mush. I don't kill just for being dirty anymore, but if someone is dirty and not posting a reason it does make me suspicious of them.</p><p>I do think that they should be created and used, but Im not sure how much they actually hinder an experienced mush. When Im mush I try to never let anyone see me dirty. Of course if I get dirty from natural causes I post in the thread. But if Im not already dirty I dont extract unless Im confident that I can do it and shower fast enough that no one will see me for the few moments Im dirty. Movement restrictions like MrMuz suggested as a basis for suspicion seems to be far more of a hindrance.</p>

                <p>You could put it to the crew this way -- the dirty thread helps keep the humans alive.<br><br>Movement restrictions for the corridors at least would be ideal. That's a great place for sporing and spiking, and you rarely have enough mycoalarms for all of them. It's very easy for mush to muddy the waters with even an inactive player ... if they're in a heavily trafficked area, they're mush vectors waiting to happen.<br><br>Otherwise, everyone should be able to explain their movements at any time, given that most ships are trying to save + not-waste their AP/MP. Well, other than giving away information useful to the mush.</p>

How can you imitate an inactive? If you are inactive, then you are not playing. Inactive are those with idle status. Those who are not using their AP and MP. What's the sense of logging in and not doing anything? To prevent killing of innocent inactive, do not bother with them, they'll starve soon if they are human, they'll not starve if they are mush.</p>

                <p>You actually CAN fake most of the tutorial, if you remember the steps of it, and no one is on the bridge at the time. You can always drop a hello and go radio silent, many less than skilled crews just accept that as proof of first game n00b, without checking. You can also pretend to be inactive. Someone asks you to do a Mush test, you just stop moving and pretend to be offline until they go off to do something else. Usually, some kind of PVE will show up and get you off the hook, and you can always go back to sabotaging stuff later. Also, watching the crew posts you can figure out when the most actives log, and thus the best time to pop the O2 tanks for maximum leakage <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>It would seem that i am outnumbered in think that acting like a new player is an unacceptable tactic. I honestly this believe that this undermines the spirit of the game. There are several reasons for this.</p><p>First, ideally each ship would contain 16 active and experienced players and i think that this would provide the best experience. Of course new players are more than welcome and i am happy to help them with any questions they might have.</p><p>Second. mush is a game of deduction about who is the mush, and this should be done on an informed basis. Of course new player will often be cut a bit of slack for mistakes. When an experienced player acts new, they are taking the easy way out. "Oh, i'm sorry i didn't know not to cook the rations". I honestly think that this is the cowards way out. You should be able to win as mush with out the other players cutting you slack for being new.</p><p>Third and lastly, the way to counter this tactic is to be ruthless with new players, as they might be mush in disguise. However, this ailienate the new players and that would be bad for both MT and the players, as we of course want more active players in the community.</p><p>While i have only encountered this strategy once, i sounds like it is fairly common. I would rather not adopt the defense strategy of kill of players for mistakes if they are acting new. However, if i find that encounter this new player defense too often i might see it as a necessary precaution. This would in the long run hopefully make people aware that it is not a viable mush strategy. Unfourtunatly it would also hurt new players quite a lot.</p><p>If it was up do me i would simply have an indicator for each member of the crew, telling whether they have played more than three ships or something like that. That would invalidate the defense and would put an end to people exploiting peoples goodwill. The is partly possible by looking at skills, but is no real help if people do not pick skills or are bronze or silver players.</p>

                <p>I'll comment that Fragile's type of player is extremely much the sort that gets my red flags raised high.</p><p>Not only will I call council and convince people that a player like that should be killed, but I will report you for it unless I can easily kill you and verify that you are Mush.</p><p>Let me tell you the story of Ian in my last game:</p><p>Ian got his talkie; said Hello, never said another word. Hung around the medilab, taking up the bed, dropped his communicator somewhere day 2. We put up with him in the bed, but then he took the apron, and didn't drop it.</p><p>We talked to him in whispers, -I- explained things very clearly. He could read - the guy knew to go to the refractory Cycle 1 and drink the coffee, not bad for a newbie heh? I explained that I could tell he knew how to read - if you can't read, you're not going to understand how to do that and when you can succeed at doing that. I explained to him how to communicate on the bridge even if he cannot remember where he put his talkie - since he can find the refractory to go drink the coffee, he can find the bridge even if he dropped his tracker.</p><p>The guy ate like a pig, very rarely advanced research, almost never dropped the apron, and appeared to waste most of his AP just moving around - supplementing it with more and more food and coffee, of course.</p><p>Being Ian he was hard to kill, but we got to check the logs and see him sometimes drink that coffee and eat a ration in the same cycle - we knew the rude jolt was human. We occasionally stabbed him or shot him when we had the AP to waste on him, him being Ian.</p><p>People who act like this are griefers. They do not belong in the game. I'm not -convinced- that SDF agrees with me, but it twists my stomach to read a thread 'suggesting' and 'discussing' how to better act like a bad player.</p><p>I'm not even convinced he was a 'real' newbie. People do multi account, and Peanutz has said elsewhere on the forum that it's possible to reset the tutorial - so just because someone does the tutorial, they may not actually be newbie.</p><p>Granted, if you are a Mush, you -can- and even -should- act like this, it's your choice, and a Mush behaving like this does not deserve a sanction in my opinion - but if you are just too hard for me to kill, I'm going to report you and let the judges sort you out.</p><p>But don't you dare believe that you can 'safely and freely' get away with this sort of behavior. Don't you dare. This behavior is inappropriate even in a newbie - if you happen to end up on a ship with me and you act like a griefer, I'm going to off you even faster than if I think you're mush but not a griefer.</p><p>Maybe I'm cursed, but of my 11 ships - I've found reason to report 1+ players on 9 of them. And like 7 were griefers.</p><p>Don't do this. I'm slower to kill someone who spikes on camera than I am to kill someone who appears to play against the team.</p>

He was Spanish and didn't know how to write proper English (he even posted in Spanish in the general chat...). He kept doing newbie mistakes which hurt the crew (which he also did before the ship was filled). I was also talking to him in private chat in Spanish and I basically was the bridge that kept him alive, because otherwise the communication with the rest of the crew was impossible, since he didn't understand anything.</p><p>But it seemed that he didn't understand either what I was saying to him in Spanish. We told him to stay in the lab working on anti-mush research so the crew did not suspect him of mush (he was sprinter Roland) but he kept doing things like going to repair a door on the other part of the ship... We ended up killing him even if I "knew" (well, you can't be sure) that he wasn't mush, just because we were afraid that the real mush could start behaving the same way.</p><p>In the end, he wasn't mush, only a bad player that didn't listen to us. The other mush also didn't speak much and also said that he was Spanish (but didn't answer my messages in Spanish), so I guess that he mimicked this player way of acting.</p><p>P.S. So, a good strategy for mush, say that you're Spanish <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>My general policy while I'm mush or human is to make the ship <em>fun</em> for EVERYONE.</p><p>Destroying the ship in Day 1 is not really that fun for the humans. Jumping out of the Daedalus with the Pasiphae and some important items also leave a bitter taste in the human's mouth. Similarly, forcing mush tests on everyone can make the game not-so-fun for the mush.</p><p>Pretending to be a newbie while you're actually an experienced player also leaves a bitter taste, unfortunately. In my opinion anyway. So, I'll never do it. Not to mention this tactic can cultivate a culture of paranoia and worse, hostility, towards the newbies, which in my opinion is the most undesireable outcome of this strategy. We want newbies to have fun in this game so they'll stay, not make them think we're all elitist snobs. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I know this don't leave many options for what is a <em>fun</em> mush. Still, the option that's left is the best one, in my opinion. Fake your usefulness to the ship to gain the human's trust in you, while you secretly convert them to your side. Each person you convert will be pleasantly surprised at your deviousness, which makes the whole thing so much more enjoyable. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I think within the first month Mush was on general release, I was in a ship with a "dictator" in the crew ORDERING what HAD to be done. I was new to the game and I was not mush. I didn't really know about stuff (tutorial/tips don't say a lot about showering and I forgot to drop the soap after I moved rooms), but I really hated the atmosphere. I was having a hard time irl but the bossy crew did not understand. Had it not have been for this forum and an external resource.... that one ship could have put me off mush. I have not had this problem in D2N.</p><p>Thinking of the "ordering".... This could have been a language issue... what is polite in one country (I am in the UK, .... would you like a cup of tea?.... the tea gets given and you reply with "thank you" but in some countries.... the thank you is not said .... why should I by thanking you for a cup of tea...?) may not be neccesary culturally in others....</p><p>"You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar" ... politeness, in some ways, can lead to more efficiency/stuff done....</p>

There are several reasons for this. First people want newbies to feel welcome. Secondly, the tutorial is kinda moronic and teaches people to things they shouldn't.

I was new to the game and I was not mush. I didn't really know about stuff (tutorial/tips don't say a lot about showering and I forgot to drop the soap after I moved rooms), but I really hated the atmosphere. I was having a hard time irl but the bossy crew did not understand. Had it not have been for this forum and an external resource.... that one ship could have put me off mush. I have not had this problem in D2N.</p><p>*snip*</p><p>"You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar" ... politeness, in some ways, can lead to more efficiency/stuff done....</p></cite><p>I agree that no one should act like a dictator. But a ship works much more efficiently with someone assuming a leadership role. Ideally this is what an active chun will do. Of course you should not run it as a dictatorship, but it is good to establish some rules early on what is ok and what is not ok. This often helps new players as well as the often do not know not to cook all the rations or to take the coffee when a Caffine junkie gioele is on board</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8039106 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8039106">goat</span></span><cite>lol people pretend to be new? that's funny<br>i just died on my first game and evyerone was really helpful and nice<br>i think there were 2 new players like me, they never attacked us<br>ur ship mustve been kinda serious</cite><p>I'm glad you had a nice first game, and that people to help you as a new player. However, if mush keep using the tatic of acting new this attitude might become more rare. I find ships are more interesting if people to take it a bit seriously. I mean it is of course a game, but you should still play to win. Otherwise there is no point in playing.</p><p>It seems the thread is derailing a bit onto the subject of griefers. While this is also a good thing to discuss it should probably have it's own thread discuss what exactly constitutes griefing. I fact several thread exist dealing with different actions and whether they can be classified as griefing. I would be great if this thread could stay on the topic of recognizing new players from mush acting new and whether or not this is an acceptable tactic.</p><p>As mentioned in my last post it seems to be a matter of opinion whether it is an acceptable way to win as mush. However, i have yet to see anyone addressing the problem that it creates hostility towards new players, which i find to be the most important argument against it. I believe that this argument alone should be enough to warrant that MT them selves take action. In the long run it would hurt their income if new players were feel unwelcome.</p>

I was new to the game and I was not mush. I didn't really know about stuff (tutorial/tips don't say a lot about showering and I forgot to drop the soap after I moved rooms), but I really hated the atmosphere. I was having a hard time irl but the bossy crew did not understand. Had it not have been for this forum and an external resource.... that one ship could have put me off mush. I have not had this problem in D2N.</cite><p>I was on that ship, remember it rather clearly, if you meant the one where you were Finola and Janice was kind of a jerk who was convinced that your irl stuff was a ruse for sympathy so you wouldn't get killed as mush. Her bloodthirst and harshness that got you killed also made most of the human crew want to kill her in the end. It actually fell to me (a mush that game) to save her life. Fun times. That being said, definitely a case of the newbie mush ruse some people do and abrasive personalities combining to work against a new player. Do think that some people tend to forget that hey, there's another person at the other end of that character, in their zealousness to win ze game. Wouldn't say the whole crew was like that though... I mean, I'm a bit biased in the case of myself (^_~) but were some other nice people aboard. One or two loudmouths can really taint a ship though. For what it's worth, you got an honorable mention in my ship diary on that one, lamented that the psychopathic, murderous humans killed such a brilliant researcher for being a bit too stinky. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

However, if mush keep using the tatic of acting new this attitude might become more rare. I find ships are more interesting if people to take it a bit seriously. I mean it is of course a game, but you should still play to win. Otherwise there is no point in playing.</p><p>.</p></cite><p>thanks man <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>well so far the mush i met transformed on first few cycles and killed a guy so people killed him<br>haven't met ppl pretending to be new hahahaa (not yet at least)<br>most times they just act really nice, i would assume, to not arous suspicion</p>
