In some cases where the mush has done mushy stuff in front of the camera and then runs away, I expose him/her to the whole crew and call out a hunt on the mush.

If a MUSH spores in front of somebody, then they already know that people know, so why bother with a private channel?

Look at <a target="_blank" href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/2403">this murdership I was on.</a> The Eleesha on this ship attacked anyone who was dirty, barely after Mush selection, and was directly responsible for the deaths of three humans by the end of the first day. Two of those were on their first game, and hadn't even had the opportunity to get to a shower; hell, they barely finished the tutorial! After she was finally killed, we had four humans dead. Then a few others died, including our only pilot, who took out the Icarus on her own. Then we lost another five humans <strong>in a single cycle</strong> due to morale loss, including Chun. We had ten dead players in the first 24 hours, <strong>all of them human</strong>. I was one of the last to die, managing to score a critical kill on Mush Ian, but that ironically dropped my own morale to zero, and I died the next cycle. Gioele was the only other human left, so I had no safe way to regain morale.</p><p>We didn't manage to get the Sol link online until Day 3, and the game started on Day 2. By Day 4, almost everyone was dead.</p><p>The only kill Eleesha tried to justify was the first one, Roland, who had gone offline after doing the tutorial. Yes, he was dirty, but at the time he went offline, there were six people still in cryo. She killed him right after Mush selection...and her lame excuse was "He was dirty, so he might be Mush."</p><p>Are you <strong>seriously</strong> telling me that after screwing over the ship that badly, with zero evidence other than the fact they were dirty, that there should be <strong>zero</strong> repercussions for that?</p>

                <p>Except that is for killing multiple people, the Op killed 1 person who WAS a MUSH. We don't know the evidence she had (maybe circumstantial, maybe she saw him spore) so we can't judge.</p><p>Also, I imagine that your crew told Eleesha to stop, and she didn't. That's not the same.</p><p>For that matter, what if a majority of the active crew had decided to kill those people? Would the fact that multiple people decided to do it, make it any better?</p><p>It's whether there was enough evidence to make a call, not whether someone talks it over first. Although, they should talk it over, there isn't always time to do so, if a MUSH is exposed, then they need to be dealt with fast, before they do more damage.</p><p>Although, while this conversation is interesting, we don't know the facts, only what the Op said in the first post, and the SDF had access to the ship's logs, and they decided it was warranted. Whether they were correct or not won't be decided here, since we really don't have any information.</p>

                <p>Very mush-like, or griefer like, saying trying to cause panic and saying that two people were mush. I attacked back when someone attacked me, since they were assisting the MUSH, and working with him in my opinion. I did accidently hit one of the people accidently which I explained was a load time error.</p><p>Which by the way, when the screen is loading you can actually still hit buttons apparently, probably not intended but the extreme lag has actually gone down. So a bug already fixed, no reason to report.</p><p>If you assist the MUSH, are you not working for the other team, and in turn be punished for your actions?

                <p>Sounds like lots of responders are jumping in with judgments but with very little information.</p><p>I'm not sure the judges give warnings based on the details we've been given, so <em>if a warning was given</em> there may/must be some details missing.</p><p>If you did get a warning, then in any case, talking to a moderator, asking them to explain exactly what you did that was incorrect, sounds like the perfect action for the OP to take. I'm not sure that the existing warning system has enough information in the warning to ensure that proper behavior correction can be made once you are warned - but the mods are able to provide the missing details.</p><br><p>However, if what happened was: OP was reported, but no answer from the judges has come yet...</p><p>Kick back and relax. Play your next games. Warnings are rarely given, it seems, for 'alright, I can see how that mistake was made' sort of behavior, especially if it's not a pattern for you.</p><p>Anyone can report you all they want to - some people report at the drop of a hat. Oh well - <strong>if you're not doing something wrong - it doesn't matter if you are reported.</strong> If someone wants to report you, says they are going to, whatever - you know what the rules are, right? Play within them, and don't care one little bit about people who say 'I'm reporting you!'. You can answer them, you can explain why it is in the rules - and then go on with your day.</p><p>If you're wrong, you'll hear about it later, you can ask for more details, accept correction, and continue to enjoy the game inside the rules that you now understand. Until then, do the best you can to play in a way that's fun for you and others and doesn't break the rules, and just enjoy yourself. Everything is going to be just fine, for all that the occasional ship is going to be tense and stressful.</p>

I did not say "if you attack anyone who "might" be mush".</p><p>Big difference. If you believe they're mush it means having reasons and being able to support them.</p></cite><p>Now you're splitting hairs, and the SDF still doesn't agree that attacking someone you believe to be Mush should leave you free of any repercussions. If you're wrong, you're still depriving the ship of a player, causing every human to lose morale, and wasting AP in the effort. If you're wrong multiple times, then you have a murdership on your hands, and you're squarely in griefing territory. Some players will <strong>genuinely</strong> believe that other people are Mush, even after they've conclusively proven themselves to be human.</p><p>I've run into more than a few players who will kill someone they believe to be Mush, just because the killer didn't pay attention to the chat, and missed out on the plan the <strong>rest of the crew</strong> agreed upon.</p><p>Case in point: The rest of the crew says to the Comms officer, "Eat a banana and a ration, and borrow the Apron so you don't get dirty." and then one player flips out and <strong>kills</strong> the Comms officer. The killer's defense was, "She took the Apron out of the Lab, so she must be Mush!"</p><p>Would you say that's a valid response, and it should be free of any repercussions? Because that exact incident happened on one of my ships, and we lost one of our most active players over it. It also happened to be Janice who was killed, so we also suffered serious morale problems as a direct result of her death.</p><p>If a <strong>genuine belief</strong> is all it takes to justify killing someone, then you've made the SDF's job much more difficult. The judges have to look at the logs, and determine if sufficient evidence existed to justify the actions taken. If the <strong>only</strong> evidence is a belief that the victim is Mush, and the thought process and evidence analysis leading up to that conclusion isn't laid out, <em>it may look like a random kill</em> to the judges.</p><p>That's why you make your case <em>before</em> using lethal force, if possible. That doesn't guarantee that you'll be free from a sanction, but it does show the judges that you're not just acting on impulse, and acting instead on evidence. Caught them in the act? Then explain that you caught them hiding an item, or that they spored in front of witnesses or a camera, or whatever the circumstances were, and that immediate action was necessary.</p><p>One of the times I played Chun, I caught our Roland in the act. Roland was dirty in <strong>CC</strong> not long after Mush selection. I knew acting on that alone wasn't good enough, so I went looking for evidence. I saw in the Inventory thread that Chao had brought items from <strong>CBS</strong> to Bravo Bay, including the knife. Minutes after Chao had left the Bay, Roland entered the Bay, didn't pick up any items, and left the room. The knife had been hidden. It didn't make sense that Chao would hide an item he just reported as having dropped, and I was the next person in the room after Roland. I searched for the knife, went to <strong>CC</strong>, and killed Roland without any warning or public announcement. Once the crew online at the time got over their astonishment of a dead mush in the first hour or so of the game, I explained myself.</p><p>The chances of my being wrong were minimal. He was the only person who could have hidden that knife, and he was dirty without cause. Of course, that ship subsequently fell to ruin as two of the players turned out to be griefers; they turned off death notifications, used a grenade in one of the dorms, and attempted a killing spree.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_8008546 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="8008546">Slider2k</span></span><cite>I got a warning for using a mild bad word <strong>once</strong> in a game (when I was blamed by some annoying person for eating <strong>all</strong> refectory rations by myself, when in reality I was eating about once a day for piloting).

"Shit! 26 new Hunters!" is acceptable, generally speaking, because it's in the heat of the moment, and more importantly, it <em>isn't directed at anyone in particular</em>. But if the swearing was used to insult someone, the judges won't let that slide. Flaming and insults are still against the rules, and that takes a higher priority over someone swearing in general.</p><p>Not knowing the details of your case offhand, that is more often what we see when a language sanction is handed out.

                <p>Actually it wasn't a kill, but a point out, and attack of said individual, my accusations were true, and in fact the person was MUSH according to end game. I have defended myself, and seen several players defend themselves against a human before as a human. It is sad that these actions that I see as common are apparently against the rules when a Chao tries to kill you, you can't try and kill them back. Though now I do know that if they are wrong in their accusation, attack me thinking I am MUSH, I can report them. This also makes me not want to play any character that would be held to the standard of 'MUSH killer' like Chao, or Eleesa, since I imagine if they are wrong several times through misguidance of the mush, or a misinterpretation of information like say a novice player cooking all of the rations, since you didn't have 'real' evidence that said person was MUSH you can potentially be banned, or in such a case you are right, you can still be banned. Though that is what I am getting from this conversation at least, since that seems to be what it is pointing towards.</p><p>Though I guess it does bring the fear back into being human, since MUSH are usually easy to identify, but if you are wrong too many times, bye bye.</p><p>Though that may not be your intentions with your post, so I will wait for another post to see what you mean by it, I am only sharing my viewpoints on such. Also honestly my previous post was more of an exaggeration then something I would do, I am rather lazy when it comes to reporting people always assuming if the issue was serious enough someone else has reported them.</p><p>Long post, but decided to try and fully flush out what I was thinking before posting, and maybe leaving some sort of confusion.</p>

                <p>Glancing over Spaz's last post reminded me of something. If you ever want to leave something for Judges to see if you think you're going to be reported for an action, you can open a whisper to yourself and explain your reasons for your actions. That <em>should</em> be in the logs that they can read, right?</p><p>After getting found out as a mush once, I opened up all three whispers and invited everyone I possibly could to fill their channels up. That seemingly looks like something a griefer would do, but I did it to see if they had a channel they were using to talk about me in private, and to gauge when they were active (I'd know if they were online if they close the whisper). I needed to know their activity so I could safely land my ship to cause more havoc and take off again. It was a one-time thing so I didn't continually try to invite people after it, but it did prove to me that they had a whisper going without me so in that one empty whisper with just myself I posted a message to any potential Judge in the event I was reported for griefing explaining my strategy.</p>

I have had a few cases where I was SO sure that someone was Mush, and I laid out the evidence for the rest of the crew, and...we ended up killing a human who was acting strangely, or was just a victim of circumstance.</p><p>Well-intentioned Mush hunting can lead sometimes lead to overzealous and reckless attacks, even with the best of intentions. There's another related point here, which is that even if there is evidence of Mush-like behavior, the person might actually be a griefer, if not a Mush. Attacking someone without warning is something that Mush do; but griefers and non-griefers alike also do so, too. And unfortunately, some new players act without knowing all of the facts, and that muddles the issue even further.</p><p>An embarrassing story of mine: I was on a beta ship where a Dorm camera broke early on Day 2. I went to investigate, and found that Frieda was standing dirty in the dorm, without having reported it. We had Chao torture her, and she didn't sabotage the camera...but she WAS Mush. She died quickly. At the time, I didn't know that cameras could break as early as Day 2, so I mistakenly assumed that Terrence, who was the only other person moving around that cycle, was a Mush.</p><p>I gathered most of the crew n a PM tab, laid out what I knew, and what the logs stated. We agreed to kill him, and oh, was I wrong... I genuinely believed he was Mush, and my lack of knowledge at the time really set us back. This was long before the SDF was formed. But I learned from it, and most of the time, I act with the consent of the crew during the hunt.</p><p>The term I that think qualifies best here is <strong>in good faith</strong>. If you are acting in good faith, with evidence to back your suspicions, <em>and</em> you can convince the crew to act in good faith with you, that is ideal. At least then they've had a chance to decide whether they want to face the possible consequences. That might be what went wrong in your case; things may have happened too fast for the crew to get on your side, and they assumed that your attack was an act of griefing, even though your suspicions were ultimately correct.</p>

I have defended myself, and seen several players defend themselves against a human before as a human. It is sad that these actions that I see as common are apparently against the rules when a Chao tries to kill you, you can't try and kill them back. Though now I do know that if they are wrong in their accusation, attack me thinking I am MUSH, I can report them. This also makes me not want to play any character that would be held to the standard of 'MUSH killer' like Chao, or Eleesa, since I imagine if they are wrong several times through misguidance of the mush, or a misinterpretation of information like say a novice player cooking all of the rations, since you didn't have 'real' evidence that said person was MUSH you can potentially be banned, or in such a case you are right, you can still be banned. Though that is what I am getting from this conversation at least, since that seems to be what it is pointing towards.</cite><p>There's a number of misunderstandings there that need to be clarified. If someone is trying to kill you, you are allowed to fight back. It may not be the best option if you're human and you know the person attacking you is human, but you certainly have the right to self defence. If someone is attacking you thinking you're Mush, that also does not break the rules. You can report, but that person will most likely be cleared. The point is, if you are attacking someone because you have good reason to believe that person is Mush, you won't get sanctioned for that. Be careful though of keeping thoughts to yourselves. If it looks like a random attack to your crewmates and you said nothing about it, it'll also look like a random attack to the judges.</p><p>I don't have the logs to see right now to know more about your specific case. However, even if I could see the logs, this sort of discussion is supposed to be limited to private messages with the mods. Keep in mind though that you may have been sanctioned for a reason completely unrelated to what you're talking about, so it's good to talk with the mods about it if that's the case instead of assuming you know why you were sanctioned in the first place.</p>

Since people are variant on the answers it is nice to see the ways the rules can be interpreted, with everything that is there. One big thing is that you always need to post to someone, somewhere that you at least suspect someone as mush, which I didn't know. I have seen various people just kill the mush without saying a single word to anyone, and no one seemed to have a problem with it. This started as me being annoyed, now I am just curious.</p>

                <p>One thing that might be happening with the 'no one saying anything', is that there could be private mush hunting threads. I usually make at least one, and if I consider one of my fellow players either too quiet or too likely to be mush or a griefer, I don't invite them into it. But it's there that mushiness is being discussed and considered, it's usually there that a death sentence is passed and execution methods chosen.</p><p>Course, afterwards I make a main thread post highlighting evidence and usually also invite everyone else into that thread after the kill, so everyone can see what was going on. Maybe not everyone does.</p><p>Remember you can talk too - 'Why'd you kill so and so', 'how'd you know he was mush' - that kind of stuff is very commonly asked, by me or others, if people are not involved on the decision-making loops. Random kills might kill a mush - that doesn't make random killing alright, ever, period. If someone kills without an evidence trail, I'm not far from organizing the ship to kill that person - as either a very likely griefer who will continue to kill without restraint or reason, or as a mush (after all, the mush know who the mush are - to just walk up and kill a mush without evidence, but they are a mush - well the killer just might be one too, if they can't give evidence as to why they knew that player was mush!).</p>

                <p><strong>Chuckles and nods</strong> I remember one game where I really, really angered our Chun, because she almost never spoke on any public thread (and as far as I know, she never made any private threads either). I don't include people who don't let me get to know at least a little about how they think - if someone won't talk to everyone, if somone won't interact with me publicly, I'm not going to start a private conversation with them, or invite them to a private talk either, not a serious, get things done sort of one. Most griefers tend to be the 'mostly silent or limited sense type', in my experience.</p><p>So this one game I made a 'sane players' thread (you act sane, active, and interactive, you get invited to it), and as often happens, that turned into a mush hunting thread (maybe one or both alpha mush are part of it - who cares, mush 'hunting mush' can give themselves away too... but these people are likely not griefers, and I like mush way more than griefers).</p><p>After a bit, we caught a mush, and Chun wasn't aware of the hunt, the evidence, or the intention to kill until right before the kill, and she threw an absolute fit. Oh well - if she'd talked more before that point, she would have been included. And having talked more, and allowed me/us to get a feel for her playstyle and personality, she was included from that point on.</p><p>But just because someone is Chun, doesn't mean I automatically trust them. Trust them to be <strong>human</strong>, of course. Trust them not to be a griefer, trust them to actually play intelligently and in a trustworthy fashion - that remains to be seen like it is for every other player in the game. But I'm not talking 'superior play' in these expectations - I'm talking about basics. Reasonable, interactive play of any skill level; proof of an ability and willingness to have two-way communication.</p>
