                <p>I just like to say random stuff now and then and didn't know where to post it.<br><cite></cite><br>This ship was fun for me (mush) <a href="http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/195" target="_blank">http://mush.twinoid.com/theEnd/195</a><br>I started as Terrence and switched with inactive Finola to get the "you completed your tutorial" message. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The glory is just messed up here, Terrence(inactive) got my mush glory and gets super nova and I as Finola have his human glory of 0. This ship was so much fun. I started by dismantling both showers then breaking the oxygen pumps. The humans realised I was mush and came to kill me, so I switched bodies with Finola when I had lost enough health. After that Stephen finished off Terence. Then the humans killed stephen who was running around the ship without talking as they knew I was either him or Finola! Then I grabbed the 2 blaster guns which they so comfortably dropped near me and was waiting for them to waste AP on me as I had the plastenite armour and the mush armour. Then I healed myself in the medlab with Finola's skill. At this point Jin Su was all panicked just because Chao was intimidating him... so he jumped into the pasiphae and fled. I decided to sabotage the command terminal to make it tougher for the humans to leave him behind and it seems to have worked as he was assassinated later. Then Jin Su came back and we killed Chao. At this point I wasted AP shooting Rolland thinking I still had time to regain AP and mutate for extra time to run around but they got lucky and dealt me multiple injuries which killed me on the cycle change.</p><p>It felt nice to have 2 blasters on me and the armor but the knife is just amazing. I was alive for almost a day because of the armor, even though humans popped up all the time to have a go on me. Even those, who didn't communicate much, came. Not just the three as they say in their messages. Most fun I've had as a mush <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
