                <p>Maybe it's just bad luck but 2 ships in a row now someone has decided against the wishes of the crew to use the hacker kit and return the ship to Sol. Both ships were very active, mush had died early and people were planning on going for Eden. Both ships also had players spending their real hard earned money (myself included) on vending machine items and gold days to give the ship a better chance at success. For now Twinoid can forget extracting any more money from me until there is either a refund system setup for cases like this and/or they somehow find a way to reduce the frequency of this happening to next to nothing.</p><p>Has this happened to you? How often does it occur? Is the MMM to blame? What do you think should be done?</p>

                <p>i think that the people that do this want to be on the MMM even though ruining someones game and active games are basicly an early MMM so those people are just stupid. It has happened once for me before, i dont think anyone spent any money on that one not sure though but we had just came back from an great expo day 4, i finished Pilgred and bam i wake up were back at SoL</p>

                <p>I've heard from a friend who's by now on a ship about 10 days... that after mush were dead, the rest of the crew just... got bored. And instead of trying to do find planets, do expeditions, and reach Eden... they just become more and more inactive.<br>I mean... do they play only to kill mush? To kill mush and go back to Sol?<br>It's really sad because Sol is like an easy ending... pretty much when you're so close to die that can't afford anything else.</p>

                <p>Hasn't happened to me yet; I've seen perhaps more than my share of griefing but not yet seen this sort.</p><p>MMM could be part of the motivation, but it happens when an MMM is not about to start. Sometimes there's smaller groups of friends, a person or two you know and like PMs you with 'Hey, I'm on a great active ship with two other friends, we have Chun, Janice, and Raluca open - think you can join us?'.</p><p>Sometimes people just don't like the feel and teamwork of the ship - maybe the Mush are already dead, maybe it's been 5 days and things are not going 'the way they should be' to a player. So they end the game for everyone.</p><p>I lean towards interpreting that as a hostile return to Sol, especially if the return is 1) not discussed and universally agreed upon, 2) not needed for survival, and especially 3) occurring before the cure is made. But even after the cure is made, a return to sol can be hostile.</p><p>The answer is report it. Another answer may be talk about it early. Make a thread and discuss with your group of people what peoples' hopes and expectations are. Make sure that everyone knows that three people have never had a ship go past day 4, 2 have been to day 10, and one just got back from a 16 day ship and is frazzled. Learn that 7 of your 14 survivors want to play as long as possible, 3 want to make sure they're free for the next MMM in a week, and 4 think that hunting mush is the only reason to play and anyone not jumping back to sol as soon as possible is crazy.</p><p>So that your people with their different goals and opinions can start to talk it out and listen to each other, and as a group get a feel for everyone's different expectations. Maybe a compromise or understanding can be reached, maybe people can be persuaded to change their hopes for this ship.</p>

                <p>There are a few safeguards against this:</p><p>1. Have Chun keep the Hacker Kit in her inventory, assuming she's active. She can still provide it in an emergency, if impending doom creeps up on you. Assuming Chun isn't the one to initiate a harmful return, that only leaves the Commander to be aware of.</p><p>2. A person who initiates a "harmful return" <strong>can be reported</strong>. I would define it as a jump to Sol that is decided on their own, <strong>without</strong> consulting the crew, AND when the ship is in no imminent danger, OR has not suffered any recent setbacks to prompt such a quick decision. Basically, <em>it's a premature end to the game, when the game could have continued for much longer.</em></p><p>Someone who just wants to end their ship so they can join a community jump (as Andre stated) may initiate a harmful return, and if reported, it may result in sanctions and even quarantines for those involved. The SDF also considers a harmful return as a form of suicide, when one person just gives up, but instead takes the rest of the ship along with them.</p><p>Also note that there are exceptions to this...there may be pressing circumstances that cause (for lack of a better term) <strong>panic</strong>, and this usually stems from the death of one or more active crewmembers in a cycle. I've been on more than one ship where the death of a highly active member caused us to say, "Let's cut our losses before we lose anyone else!", followed by a quick jump to Sol. But even then, the crew online are to be consulted, and as Impet stated, <em>you should talk about it in <strong>advance</strong>, so the crew knows when such a jump could be initiated</em>. It's fine if you even plan a specific cycle to jump well in advance, and set the conditions for an early return if things go very badly before then. We highly encourage that discussion, because it's an important safeguard, too.</p><p>If it's been well discussed in advance, no pressing threats or recent losses have occurred, and a return to Sol is made <em>anyway</em>, consider reporting it, and the SDF will look into it.</p>

Have Chun keep the Hacker Kit in her inventory, assuming she's active. She can still provide it in an emergency, if impending doom creeps up on you. Assuming Chun isn't the one to initiate a harmful return, that only leaves the Commander to be aware of.</cite><p>Heh, very often you want the hacker kit to be easily available. I end up Commander quite a bit and people often find a planet or finish shooting aracks when it's 2 AM, because that's where peak time is in other countries. I don't check mush by then and often wake up about 4 cycles later because of my schedule.</p><p>Also, Chun is the least active in almost all of my games. And it's usually best to give it to an IT expert.</p><p>These early return people should be punished more than griefer/killers. A griefer ruins the game for a few people, and makes the game harder for others. An early returner ends the game for everyone.</p>

Knowing where people are is very useful when you're Terrence (free movement), and for knowing if a dorm is full or not. Not to mention all the NERON projects that affect the tracker or iTrackie: better to know where a fire is than run around aimlessly. Better to know a door is blocked before you go that way. Better to be able to tell which oxygen tank needs fixing than having to check both. There are lots of reasons to want the tracker on hand.</p><p>You should report someone who goes to Sol against the opinion of the majority. It's considered a reportable offense, so make sure to do it, otherwise they won't learn.</p>
