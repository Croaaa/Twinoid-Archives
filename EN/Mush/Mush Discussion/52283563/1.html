                <p>On my current ship and many past ships I've had players who were 100% active and never spoke a word. Sometimes, they would even do useful tasks. I find it annoying, but most the time it turns out fine.</p><p>The problem I have is with players who both don't speak and obviously don't read. By obvious, I mean threatening them with death if they don't stop something and they blatantly ignore it. To me this screams greifer.</p><p>In my current ship, we have a silent player who has since the beginning of the game done nothing but research projects. This isn't so bad till we actually looked at what he has been researching. Nearly every time it was not what the crew wanted. Most of the time it was a junk project, but it wasn't a concern as he couldn't finish it himself; however, one time it ended up confusing a new player to think the project he was researching was what we wanted resulting in the wrong project being researched! I threatened to kill whoever kept doing the wrong projects as it was causing problems and the points could be spent better elsewhere (No on rebutted this declaration). Following this, he continued to work on the wrong projects and even got one completed! Side note: this is on a mush-free ship and the player was never Mush.</p><p>Here is my question for this discussion: at what point is this player reportable? He has already obviously been trying to sabotage projects research. As far as I'm concerned he is playing against his team.</p>

                <p>I remember having a similar problem, Kuan Ti was unresponsive and did weird things, at some point he finished the wrong project which was close to being useless all by himself. We ended up killing him for griefing/being mush, but there were other suspicious things he did besides this. The project WAS the tipping point though.</p><p>Did your fella at any point advance the right project? It's possible he's from another server, but can't speak english and rather new, so he doesn't know which project does what. But if he's exclusively working on the wrong project every single time, then I'd say it's definitely working against your team.</p><p>I imagine some griefers have a tactic of being not as obvious, so that they wouldn't get quarantined as often and maybe even get away with it. Won't go into detail, so as not to give them ideas.</p>
