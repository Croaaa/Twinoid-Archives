                <p>New to the game, and I like puzzles and figuring out mechanics as a hobby. Most of the stuff I've learned as I go on, but there is one major question I have regarding Mush, and am unsure if ANYONE knows the answer, nor do I have any idea on how it could possibly be tested. BEWARE! LONG QUESTION!</p><p>So here is the question (See next post for discussion instigating this question):</p><p>Not including fires/electrical spikes.<br>When bad things happen to the ship, do the bad things happen (equipment/doors breaking, pretty much) how are the items that are selected to break chosen? PLEASE READ THE EXAMPLES, I UNDERSTAND THAT NO D20 IS USED, BUT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE.</p><br><p>A) Ship is on day X. Ship rolls a 1D20 to determine if there is a breakage. If D20&lt;5, break equipment on the ABLE-TO-BREAK list. Roll 1D(Y) where Y is the current number of unbroken items</p><p>ABLE-TO-BREAK LIST. (Full of only items that are currently unbroken)<br>1-Oxygen Tank<br>2-Antenna<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Y-Fuel Tank</p><br><p>B) Same as above, except ABLE-TO-BREAK contains ALL items on ship. If the "dice roll" lands on something that is already broken, move to next available item to break on the list.</p><p>C) Each room has its own "breakage" chance which is rolled, then an ABLE-TO-BREAK list is created for each room, then (one of the two above)</p><p>D) Each ITEM has its own "breakage" chance which is rolled, regardless of already broken stuff.</p><p>For more comprehensive questions, feel free to look at this discussion I had with other players:</p>

                <p>13:18 Averell Also, another newbie question....<br>13:18 RANDOMPLAYER1 Yup?<br>13:18 Averell When things get broken, or bad events happen, does every room/every item roll its own chance to break?<br>13:18 Averell Or does it determine something bad happens, then something is randomly chosen from the list of bad things available?<br>13:19 RANDOMPLAYER1 That depends what thing. Fires roll for each thing separately, electrical spike breaks everything at once.<br>13:19 Averell If it is the latter, shouldn't we always immediately fix O2 tanks as their breaking won't bother us?<br>13:19 RANDOMPLAYER1 How do you mean?<br>13:19 Averell Well, we are good on O2. So if the oxygen tanks break, it is no big deal to us<br>13:20 Averell If a bunch of things break at once, it would be on the bottom of the repair list<br>13:20 Averell But<br>13:20 Averell If it cycles through available items, wouldn't keeping it on the *possible to break* list better?<br>13:20 Averell Since we don't really need it and it isn't a big deal, compared to something like an engine or antenna that we wouldn't want broken?<br>13:21 Averell Better example<br>13:21 Averell Say items in the ship are given a random # 1-10<br>13:21 Averell Lets say Oxygen is 4, Engine is 5, Antenna is 6<br>13:21 Averell Bad thing happens, so a 1D10 is rolled *an example remember) to determine object being broken<br>13:22 Averell If Oxygen Tank (4) is rolled, would it move on to the next (5) and break the engine?<br>13:22 Averell Or would the game then roll a 1D9, taking the O2 tank off of the available things to break?<br>13:22 RANDOMPLAYER1 Right, I get what you mean.<br>13:22 Averell If that is true, I would want that tank always on the possible to break list<br>13:23 OTHERPLAYER2 Look at it this way<br>13:23 RANDOMPLAYER1 My answer is: I have no clue or available data. Sori.<br>13:23 OTHERPLAYER2 Your idea, best scenario:<br>13:23 Averell This way, if we have 4 objects breaking at once, we can prioritize them (If 02 breaks, thats only 3 important things instead of 4)<br>13:23 OTHERPLAYER2 O² breaks two times<br>13:23 OTHERPLAYER2 AP for 2 repairs + 2 times moving in there<br>13:23 OTHERPLAYER2 other way: let O² be broken a bit, a new break happens<br>13:24 OTHERPLAYER2 now somethign else there is broken that needs repair<br>13:24 OTHERPLAYER2 result: 2 repair ap used, 1 times move used<br>13:24 Averell Correct<br>13:24 Averell But as the ship goes on, more and more bad things will happen at once<br>13:24 OTHERPLAYER2 so in the end it doesn't really help that much either way<br>13:24 Averell Eventually to the point where we will be unable to deal with it<br>13:24 OTHERPLAYER2 which is more reason to use as few resources as possible on contingency plans with dubious benefit <br>13:25 RANDOMPLAYER1 Different success ratings for different things, though. O2 tanks might be something like...70% chance to repair, with both wrenches and bottle openers? (not exact number but somewhere along that line)<br>13:25 Averell I would much rather fix 3 important things and leave the O2 tank *see example above* than try fixing 4 things<br>13:25 OTHERPLAYER2 Yeah, of course, but it soudned like you advocated rushing over to O² tank asap whenever it breaks<br>13:25 RANDOMPLAYER1 Engines would be somewhere around 20% chance to repair with all the fixers (again, not exact number)<br>13:26 Averell No not always OTHERPLAYER2<br>13:26 Averell Just not avoiding fixing it to "save ap"<br>13:26 Averell when passing through/available/etc.<br>13:26 Averell Right RANDOMPLAYER1.<br>13:26 OTHERPLAYER2 Yeah, obviously<br>13:26 Averell I would much rather attempt a fix on O2 than an engine<br>13:27 Averell Hence my question, wouldn't we want to fix it generally pretty quickly. The only way that not fixing it would really be a benefit<br>13:27 OTHERPLAYER2 For all we know equipment breaks are ship-wide, so any specific item being broken doesn't change odds too much<br>13:27 Averell Is if the above scenarios are not correct, and everything is rated individually through the whole ship<br>13:27 OTHERPLAYER2 so I wouldn't go out of the way for unimportant things<br>13:27 OTHERPLAYER2 but the unimportant things do pile up, so they do need fixing once in a while<br>13:27 Averell OTHERPLAYER2-- if equipment breaks are ship-wide, we want the easy to fix stuff to break, so we want to fix it<br>13:28 Averell So the hard stuff has less of a chance to break<br>13:28 Averell Even if the chance is negligable.... it adds up over time *even if unseen*<br>13:28 Averell negligible* <br>13:28 OTHERPLAYER2 That's exactly what I said.<br>13:28 Averell So... back to my newbie question<br>13:29 OTHERPLAYER2 Gets annoying being "corrected" with my own words <br>13:29 Averell I took it to you saying only fix unimportant things when a bunch are broken at once<br>13:29 Averell My apologies if I misunderstood<br>13:29 OTHERPLAYER2 I meant fix them when you can do so without goung out of your way, which should keep their overall amount pretty low</p>

                <p>There's a lot unknown about the exact nature of the code. Some players have been part of data mining experiments. You might enjoy talking to the Department of Mush Research casting guys, sounds like you're already one of them <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>My answer is based on my experiences, and imperfectly answers the questions you are actually asking, but does perfectly explain what I have observed. The fragments of your question which this answer doesn't touch: This is because I don't know those parts - and as far as I know, no player knows those parts.</p><p>But I go with D. Here's my reasoning and supportive, if circumstantial evidence.</p><p>When equipment breaks 'without cause' (wasn't an event like fire or electric spike) it is possible for more than one item to break. The more time in play passes and the more AP spent, the greater the odds that something(s) will break each and every cycle.</p><p>It is hidden from players whether the number of already broken things affects the odds of other things breaking - however I believe from my observation it does not. Reason:</p><p>Certain objects (fuel tanks, I'm looking at you. Yeah, both of you) break more often than other objects. A LOT more often. If you run to fix your broken fuel tank(s) every time they break, they are likely to rebreak within 1-4 cycles as the game goes on (once they start to break, that is). Most ships will leave broken fuel tanks alone until there is a need to load more fuel. I have not noticed that something else breaks every 1-4 cycles on those ships that do not fix the fuel tanks, but I sure have noticed the #*&amp;(#$*%&amp; fuel tanks rebreaking very, very soon after some eager player repairs them again and again and again each time they break on the rare ship that does that (Remember what I said about AP spent increasing the total ship difficulty too <img src="../../../../gfx/square/nooo.png" alt=":nooo:" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>Late game, often many, many, MANY items are broken. Players just cannot keep up. Yet - certain items (Gravity sim, I'm looking at you. Really suspiciously, so behave!) break really rarely. Even in the end days, they break really rarely. Which is good, these 'almost never break' things tend to be vital for normal ship function and incredibly high difficulty to repair. If something was being randomly selected to break, then when most everything was broken, we'd expect to see the rare to break stuff breaking more often. I flat out don't see this - and I watch for it.</p><p>Circumstantial evidence: Destroyed items. When a fire breaks out in a room, it has a chance to break or destroy all breakables and destroyables present. Each one saves independently, you cannot fill the room with destroyables to try and 'sacrifice that' instead of what you want to save from the flames- still the same chance to lose every item in the room that can be destroyed. Since 'every item gets its independent chance' is used elsewhere in the game, I expect that it is used more than just once.</p>

                <p>I was aware of the fire breaking chance, which is why I excluded that from my original question. The only issue that I have in believing you (at this point unless data proves me otherwise) is if AP used increases the chance of items breaking. I hope you can understand logic.</p><p>Example <br>50 AP used-&gt; 1D20 rolled<br>100 AP used 2D20 rolled. <br>150 AP used-- 3D20 rolled, all results -1.<br><br>This would also work in an exponential equation (Not correct, an example):<br><br><br>NumDiceRollsForDamage= (AP Spent - (insert random arbitrary number here))^3 +1.<br>For each NumDiceRollsForDamage<br>NumItemsDamaged= (1D20 ) + NumItemsDamaged (Store result of each dice for equation below)<br><br>The chance of damaging items can of course change as well, but I hope you understand what I am saying. <br><br>From this, it COULD then go into another die roll:<br><br>For each DiceRoll<br>If<br>......DiceRoll &lt; (AP Spent / 20 +1 ), (roll 1D100, giving DamageChance)<br>.......If DamageChance &lt; (AP Spent /20 +1) <br>...............SomethingDamaged(BadDamageTable)<br><br>Else If DiceRoll &lt; (AP Spent /10 ), (roll 1D50(DamageChance)<br>....If DamageChance &lt; (AP Spent /20 +2) <br>...............SomethingDamaged(ModerateDamageTable) <br><br>Else If DiceRoll &lt; (AP Spent/5), (roll 1D20 giving DamageChance)<br>......If DamageChance &lt; (AP Spent /20 +3) <br>................SomethingDamaged(TinyDamageTable)<br><br>Else<br>........No Damage from this roll<br><br><br>This is a very quick formula, I'm aware it cannot be this as you will eventually get to 100% breakage ratios per dice so it is probably a curved function of some sort, but this works for a QUICK scenario.<br><br>Assuming a variation of the formulas above, there would be a far greater chance of something on the LightDamageTable (I'm looking at the fuel tanks!) than something on the BadDamageTable( Gravity Sim, for example) I've seen a gravity sim break early, and it was proven that mush didn't do it, there was no electrical spike, no fire. And I've only been on 3 ships.<br><br>Certain items can also be more or less rare within each table too (2x the chance of an engine breaking compared to Grav Sim. on the hard table)<br><br> (I wasn't aware AP used rose difficulty, I assumed it was the longer voyage! Makes sense for my current ship though, we only just started getting massive fires/breakages once we started mass eating jumpkins to explore)</p>

I could use one of those in my life.<br>The problem with the theories I propose is that it is extremely hard to test, you would need someone with knowledge to confirm.<br>I do admit however that you make a compelling point about reusing code and the fire chances.

                <p>Difficulty is based upon a combination of how long the ship's been going and the amount of AP being spent. Devs came right out at one point and said as much regarding more AP being spent increasing ship difficulty, although not the specifics of how - sorry, I don't have source to link. But it's an attempt to help balance the game for more or less active ships. Not sure how big of an effect it is, although in my experience, time seems to be a bigger determining factor.</p>

                <p>Extremely inactive ships don't last to the late days (to my knowledge), however the progression of difficulty for a say, D6 ship with very little AP spent looks to me more like an active D3 ship in terms of difficulty. What's missing here is adequate sample size to exclude the atypical ship difficulties - can't ignore the humor and snark of the RNG, but with enough examples, we can laugh and snark back.</p>

                <p>True Impet, but again this is an issue that (I believe) is nearly impossible to test. Would require 30 sets of 5 ships logging all ap spent and damages, averaging each set, then taking the average of the 30 results for an accurate average with a 95% confidence level (if I remember my stats correctly)<br>Of course, even after all of that testing you STILL can have either result (everything having its own chance vs. whole ship damages) with more complex formulas, but at that point you get into the two logical decision makers:</p><p>The simplest answer is usually the correct one (Obviously this one is more relevant) <br>When in doubt, eliminate the impossible, whatever is left, however improbable, is truth</p>

Most things I've wondered about I've been able to figure out by asking vets and pouring over (in some cases well, others poorly) documentation, as well as minor quick tests of my own.

                <p>I do believe I said nearly impossible. <br>The number of ships is not in question... it is the data required and the potential relationship(s)</p><p>You would need:<br>2 sets of 30 sets of 5 ships (300 ships) (minimum, comparing frequent fixes to rarely).<br>ALL data logged. ALL. Literally. Almost all. You know what I mean (All equipment malfunctions, all ap spent, keeping track of exactly when it happened)<br>Average all information several times (AP range used at each malfunction point (Since you can use more than 1 ap/cycle), # of malfunctions/equipment (and room), which cycle on each voyage was each thing broken, etc.).</p><p>That would only bring you averages to answer the O2 question (Is it better to fix things when possible or let useless things lie broken). You still don't answer what the fundamental mechanics are. Is it a nice interesting formula, is it really simple, or is it a formula big enough to fit in an encyclopedia? How does the amount of AP used affect the rates? The current day/cycle? Combined?</p><p>Without at least PART of the data being known, you cannot solve for whether or not everything is being checked individually or not. At least I haven't been convinced of that yet..... I encourage you to try, and I'll probably respond by making a more complicated formula to encompass the negation of your theory. (See Tables Chance)</p>

                <p>Of course, upon further reflection I have thought of a way to test it, but the likelihood of it happening would be abysmal (unless there are super amazingly dedicated testers... which I believe some of you are, but I'm not sure if anyone is this dedicated)</p><p>Would require even more sets than above.</p><p>2 sets of 30 sets of 5 ships that end on D5, logging everything<br>2 sets of 30 sets of 5 ships that end on D10, logging everything<br>2 sets of 30 sets of 5 ships that end on D15, logging everything<br>2 sets of 30 sets of 5 ships that end on D20, logging everything</p><p>You could then compare each set against each other, and compare the comparisons. That might get an accurate picture on almost everything (the AP spent relationship, the Day # relationship, the breakage chances while fixing vs not fixing) <br>You could then calculate the ratio between D5 and D10 sets, the ratio between D10 and D15, the ration between D15 and D20, then compare the rate of increase between those three ratios... That would give a pretty accurate AP spent/days spent relationship. You could then use that relationship to begin building a breakage formula for fixing vs. not fixing (assuming a difference somewhere), as well as a formula for things breaking overall (which I haven't really seen/heard of anywhere in my research)</p><p>The... planning that would have to go into such ships would have to be perfect. Do as little as possible to survive (creating a better average for ap spent), everyone surviving up to each landmark day (depending on which set), everyone dying on the exact same cycle (to minimize impact of ap spending killing off all characters.

                <p>Frankly, even in French for French speakers, that message puzzled us for a long time and still does. BM is famous for his cryptic messages (<a href="http://twinoid.com/ev/34996109" target="_blank">http://twinoid.com/ev/34996109</a> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>The "crew's capacity" might mean their skills, or it might mean their rapidity of reaction (if broken things get repaired immediately, for example). Or their efficiency in dealing with obstacles (breakage, fires, injuries... maybe hunters too).</p><p>It's not the only message in which BM has evoked the complexity of the code. He also mentioned it about the growing size (and difficulty) of planets, when he tried to synthesize the mechanics but didn't explain in details : <a href="http://twd.io/e/8_Mg0g/18" target="_blank">http://twd.io/e/8_Mg0g/18</a> .</p><p>As for the breakage code, or difficulty in general, there are a few things that can be noted. Some items have a higher chance of breaking than others. Tanks break very often, if not all the time in the end, while the gravity simulator rarely breaks more than once (not counting fires or electrical spikes). Patrol ships break fairly often too, less than tanks, but more than other items. Same for turrets. But it may be more noticeable because there are several of them.</p><p>Also, some items can't break at all (PILGRED, narcotics distiller, beds, Icarus, cryo module), but they are probably still taken into account, because there are sometimes Neron announcement about them breaking.</p>
