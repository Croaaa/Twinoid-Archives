Here’s a rundown on what we learnt and some tips on what works.</strong></p><br><div class="tid_h2">Do I need to test my game?</div><p><img src="//imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/7/c/49db119c_8368070.jpg" class="tid_img tid_right tid_parsed" style=""> You’re proud of your game and so you decide to show it to the world. The world tells you: “this is crap”, “why didn’t you do this?”, “What’s this?”, “derp.”</p><p>Play testing your game is an essential part of producing a title that people will keep coming back to and especially one that’s going to put food on the table. <strong>Start testing early and test often</strong>. This will keep you on track and ensure that your game is the best it can be by the time you get to (soft)launch.</p><div class="tid_h2">What am I testing?</div><p>The stage of development will determine what you test and you should think carefully about what you want to test at each step.</p><ul><li>Test your proto to make sure the base idea is fun.</li><li>Test your ‘first draft’ to see if people like the universe.</li><li>Test your pre-release version for bugs and comprehensibility.<br><strong>This step will define the entire process</strong>. The testers you choose and the questions you ask are all defined by what you want to test. You wouldn't call in your grandma to debug a level, but you might want her feedback on whether a Scrabble game is readable on a smartphone...</li></ul><br><div class="tid_h2">How will you test this?</div><p>The practical side of the playtest requires planning and coordination. Here you need to think about the logistics of the test. You should:</p><ul><li><strong>Let the testers play by themselves without observation</strong>. (try to imitate the conditions under which a real user will play your game, all by themselves.)</li><li><strong>Record the session</strong>. We used BB Flashback Express to record what was happening on the screen of the computer and the reactions of the players simultaneously.</li><li>Record their <strong>individual impressions</strong> of the game, without the influence of other people. Our testers filled out a short questionnaire immediately after playing and were allowed to take notes during the test.</li><li>Talk to them. We conducted a group debrief after the test where we sat down and had a frank discussion. <strong>Let them talk</strong>, you’ll be amazed at the things they can tell you. For practicality we did this in small groups of five with two developers present.</li><li>Let them chat more casually after the test. We ordered pizza and sat around and talked, this helps with spreading the word and getting them to come back.</li></ul><br><div class="tid_h2">Design a questionnaire.</div><p><img src="//imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/7/6/8262d9f2_8368070.jpg" class="tid_img tid_right tid_parsed" style=""> This step goes hand in hand with thinking about what you want to test. Sit down and ask questions about the things you have decided to test. If you’re looking at the tutorial of a game you could ask questions like:</p><ul><li>Overall did you find the tutorial helpful?</li><li>Was it too long?</li><li>Were there any points you felt needed improvement?<br>Next, plan how you’re going to gather the responses. <strong>We used Google Forms to create a questionnaire that fed responses into a Google Sheet</strong>. You can see an example <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/a/mtwin.fr/forms/d/1ZjqyHH1QJdcjdYtJnIhu9X-eEQdsxRLU-ThcYx0AwpE/viewform">here.</a></li></ul><p>Your questionnaire should:</p><ul><li>Be multiple choice where possible, and return easily parsable data.</li><li>Always frame the questions in the same direction. For example satisfaction questions based on a scale should always have positive responses as high numbers.</li><li>Limit open response fields to a set number of characters, otherwise your testers will write you a novel.</li></ul><br><div class="tid_h2">How do I choose my testers?</div><p><img src="//imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/3/c/cbe45788_8368070.jpg" class="tid_img tid_right tid_parsed" style=""> Planning who will test the game is critical because it forces you to <strong>think about who your target market is</strong>. Think about who you’re making this game for and make sure they want to play it!</p><ul><li>If you don’t know your target market, gather a wide demographic of testers.</li><li>Always make sure you have an even split of male/female testers.</li><li>Be careful that your testers are at the right level for your game. For example don’t get an experienced puzzle play to calibrate the levels of a puzzle game, or it will end up too hard.</li></ul><br><div class="tid_h2">How do I find these people?</div><p>Ask your friends. Talk to your family, put a notice on your university message board, online or anywhere you can stick things that people will see. If you’re looking for a specific demographic then think about places they frequent and concentrate you messages in these locations.</p><p><strong>We partnered with a peak body and a local association to find testers outside of our user base</strong>. Talking to people in the industry meant that we were quickly able to find an audience receptive to doing some tests. Before we knew it we had over 150 people in our city ready to test our stuff.</p><p>Tests over the internet are great, but don’t underestimate the value of having your testers do it in person.</p><br><div class="tid_h2">Setting up:</div><p>You will need:</p><ul><li>A space to test in: We have a decent sized office, but a garage/bedroom or your moms house will suffice. Just <strong>make sure you can separate the testers</strong>.</li><li>A time slot: Run a doodle with your testers and then pick a time that works for everyone. <strong>Make sure you can handle the amount of testers that will arrive</strong>. We asked our testers to come in groups of 5, arriving in half hour intervals so we wouldn't be swamped.</li><li>Devices: Ensure that you have enough computers/tablets/phones or whatever it is that you are testing on. If you want to build the game on the testers phones or provide access over the net, make sure you will have time to do this.</li><li><strong>Recording software or cameras</strong>: Recording the tests will provide you with a stack of data that your questionnaire or discussion might have missed. <strong>Don’t forget to get permission from your testers</strong>…</li><li>To have everything ready: We set up limited access profiles on our computers and a clean web browser. We bookmarked the URLs of the game and questionnaire.</li><li>To <strong>test everything</strong>: We tested and ensured that our recording software and sound was working and generally practiced how to switch on and off recording as well as deciding on a file structure for the saved videos.</li><li>To <strong>do a dry run</strong>: Have one of your friends or colleagues arrive at the office and usher them in. Explain what’s going to happen and have a chat. Sit them down at the computer and show them how it will work. Time their progress in the game and work out how long they need to finish the test and complete the questionnaire. Once you know how long it takes you know how long to allocate on the day.</li></ul><p><img src="//imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/d/c/01268950_8368070.jpg" class="tid_img tid_parsed" style=""> <span class="tid_sideNote">Last minute rush testing or our computers... Do as we say not as we do!</span></p><br><div class="tid_h2">Run the test:</div><p>Release the hounds! Get your testers over and run your test.</p><p>Make sure you do:</p><ul><li>Feed and water your testers. Keeps them sharp and encourages them to come back.</li><li>Listen to what they say and write it down!</li><li>Encourage all of them to speak and if you have the chance chat to them one on one.</li><li>Let them test the game freely.</li></ul><p>Make sure you DON’T:</p><ul><li>Hover around while they test.</li><li>Help them during the test (unless it’s really really stopping them from playing).</li><li>Tell them they’re wrong when they tell you something.</li><li>Offer to pay them (unless you work at King, then you can pay up).</li></ul><p>A lot of these things might seem pretty simple (even stupid) but you’d be amazed at how <strong>many devs can’t hold back when they see a player struggling</strong>, they want to help them get past that tricky bit, but in so doing, ruin the test and potentially their game.</p><br><div class="tid_h2">Analysing your test data:</div><p><img src="//imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/7/b/99d2e68e_8368070.jpg" class="tid_img tid_right tid_parsed" style=""> Once the masses (or individuals) have left you need to go over the data. The easiest part of this is comparing the notes you’ve taken and making a todo list of the most common points. This can quickly give you a few months worth of work and it can be tempting to stop there. But don’t.</p><p><strong>Some of the most interesting insights are gained by watching the videos</strong>. You’d be amazed at what a tester will do when they think no one is watching. We’ve seen everything from them giving us running commentary on what they’re doing, singing and bouncing all the way through the test, to rage quitting and giving the finger to the game while mumbling a few choice words.</p><p>Then there is the questionnaire. If you used google forms like we did then you won’t have any problems quickly analysing the data and drawing conclusions. We noticed for example that our game appealed much more to a feminine audience in terms of aesthetics, but that the gameplay was often more deeply explored by the younger men (core gamers).</p><br><div class="tid_h2">Summing up:</div><p>In short, play testing is useful for the feedback it provides, but also for <strong>the process that it forces you to undertake</strong>. Indie devs often forget about the marketing side of game development and small scale regular play tests are a great way to keep you focused on creating a game that’s not only fun, but that is more likely to find an audience and convince them to stay and play.</p><p>If you have any questions feel free to comment on the forums below.</p>
