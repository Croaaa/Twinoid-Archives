                <p>Yeh I don't agree with all the so called "trash-talk" you get online, but I dont think we should emphasize the fact that it's gender related. If your black they'll throw racial slurs at you, if your a girl they'll be sexist, if you've got a speech impediment they'll take the piss and if your a boy they'll do anything they can to throw you off your game/ generally abuse you. I think the point that should be made is that there are people being generally abusive and overly anti-social to everyone. IMO that's the underlying issue, gender related abuse is just an effect of such, if you want to solve the issue you must find the cause (see: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzWckYfZhbA">The White Stripes-Effect and Cause</a>)</p><p>I didn't rob a bank... because you made up the law</p>

                <p>Crayola you make an excellent point!<br>However, I believe it is wrong.</p><p>I'm male. I've never claimed to be anything else.<br>For some reason (-cough- my name -cough-) people tend to assume I'm female.</p><p>I get a fair bit of abuse, as we all do. More when playing FPS games, naturally.<br>I have found that the easiest way to reduce this is to change my name.</p><p>Abusive messages dropped by a considerable amount (around 40% less)... <br>And they lacked the 'punch' of the sexist ones. They were half-hearted 'lol noob lol's, as opposed to the half-page 'get back to the kitchen' essays I was used to reading.<br>Plus no requests for lewd acts.<br>Not all of them. Some people's hate knows no gender or race.<br>To an extent you can respect that sort of hate. Obviously no hate is preferable but at least they aren't hateful <strong>and</strong> racist. And the world takes all sorts, I suppose.</p><p>My current theory, and it is less than a theory, is that women are easier to insult.<br>With all the hateful clichés they make a much easier target, especially for those who, shall we say, are yet to reach their peak maturity.</p><p>The final straw is that most other insulting techniques are simply harder to notice.<br>Not all males are lonely, sad or ugly but all women are in fact women.<br>Therefore all it takes is a slight trip through the lens of delusion for being female to be inherently inferior, then you just need to shove in some good old-fashion sexism and start exaggerating. <br>There you have an easy statement that is very offensive with little need for thought.</p>

                <p>Hannelor, you too make an excellent point <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> And I think you're actually right. I guess women are easier to insult and to top that off, I think in a way it's more socially acceptable (only by a small amount) to be sexist than racist. I.E I think you'd be more likely to be banned from a game for racist behaviour than you are sexist. So yeh I would agree women do have it worse than other people but to be fair, I do think my point does kinda still stand, be it on one crooked leg. Just in the way that people wont generally go out to be sexist, they'll just see a girl (or a black person, etc) and see that as a "weakness" and pick on it, they don't discriminate they'll go after everyone; although some people are easier targets than others.</p><p>I swear some people just feed of off negativity. Those types of people aren't trolls, they're vampires!</p><p>Haha, Hannelor, in all honesty I thought you were a girl as well <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> Although you don't carry yourself as a girl, it is purely your name. I wouldn't change it because of that though <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Axiin, that article was really, really good. <br>My pet theory concerning hate on women in games is simply:<br>Men see gaming as the last domain of MANliness, and it needs to be defended at all cost.<br>That might not be true for everybody, but the internet is a hivemind that acts as a force multiplier for itself. The internet follows itself.<br>If one influential part of the internet doesn't like women, because they feel they are intruding in their domain or they hate women because they can't get them, then they'll start hating on them.<br>The rest of the internet will follow, because, it's cool! That guy does it, everybody does it, no one knows I did it, and she shouldn't be here anyway, gaming is for men.</p>

Now I don't really know where I'm going with this, but we need these people. Without them we can't get on our high horses and say that wrong is wrong and right is right.

Nobody will argue that sexism and misogyny are not wrong. The hard part is in recognizing them, catching yourself before you do or say something that degrades half of the world population.

                <p>Right sorry. This just came up in my household after watching Wimbledon. My mum was moaning on like a 21st century modern lady about how woman tennis players don't make as much as men. <br>I said 'well they don't play as many sets'<br>to which she replied 'trust you to support the men' and I said:<br>'Well tbh i couldn't give a flying fuck' and her reply: 'nah me neither.'</p><p>Anyway this lead me to the thought that men's tennis, men's football, it's just.... better. I'm not much of a sports fan but the men are stronger, faster, longer enduring. I just dunno I don't like to say it but it's obvious. Obviously I'm not saying men should say 'Hey! we're faster, stronger and longer enduring than you' But I don't know. Me, I would most likely get pwned by any girl in the street in a fist fight.<br>But when the human body is pushed to it's limit men seem to be able to peak at a higher level. Would I be fair in this assessment?</p>

                <p>The internet is a reflection of the world. Sexism didn't start with the internet it starts with the home, the school, the workplace. Primary, secondary and tertiary socialisation. Damn it people didn't you read the article. Anyway you lot are looking way to much into this. Let's put on our serious faces and look at the serious thread where we can discuss serious issues. Knowing that you've done a little good (your part) in this god-forsaken place. Once you've got sexism sorted, can you look at war and famine please. PM me when it's done so I can come out of my small dark hiding place. T'would be good to see the sun again.</p>

                <p>Agreed. But does this thread raise awareness? Obviously not. Do the articles raise awareness? Obviously not, but is disputable. You must have this weird image that there are people out there saying 'you slag' or whatever (sexist stuff) and think. 'What I'm doing is not bad, and I just need a reality check to square me out.' Just like smokers know that it's bad for them, yet they do it anyway.</p>

                <p>Yeh, I don't disagree with the moral standings of this thread, or people's motives posting in this thread, but it terms of this thread turning people's minds away from sexist comments, I'd have to agree with Switz. There will be the odd person who reads this thread (or something like it) and thinks "I do throw a bit of banter girls sometimes, perhaps I should tone it down" but it is a one in a a hundred million kinda thing. The problem is with the generally abusive people, they see something such as sex and have no moral obligations stopping them using that as a weapon. These people would laugh at threads such as this, further more, will most likely feel a sense of achievement for causing such a stir. Maybe, tongue in cheek, this thread revives a lost flame in their anti-social internet history.</p><p>But, TBH, when I saw this thread, I just saw it as a chance to discuss, something that I enjoy doing for my benefit (my benefit alone) because ethics, Sociology, Psychology and Philosophy are all things I love to ponder over and discuss and this subject covers just about all of them</p><p>Workshop, I think he means that he thinks it's obviously not, but knows that other people would dispute the fact.

                <p>The sexist abuse comes from the people who are generally abusive online. Be it racism, sexism or whatever (they do it all) I believe they all stem from the same problem and naturally I group them together.</p><p>I read what Hannelor said and appreciated his opinion and the manner in which he stated it. However, I think he was saying girls are more likely to be abused online and are possibly easier to offend.

                <p>No you misunderstand.</p><p>Girls are easier to point out just by seeing their names. Older gamers aren't as easy to pin point. If they actually have put their ages on their profiles at all. But also, there will be a much larger amount of girls setting out to be gamers as they are about half the worlds population. (Depending on what you class as old) Also, I imagine it's harder to actually abuse an older person as they can either come up with smart replies to counter the stupid abuse or just wipe it off their shoulder.</p><p>I'm not belittling sexism at all. It is a huge problem. But so is racism.</p><p>YOU are belittling racism by saying that sexism is a much more important problem to deal with.

Guilt is very manipulable, we like to feel guilty it gives the impression of growth in ourselves.</p><p>But anyway, away with all this moral one-up-man-ship. If you want to actually make a difference you need to step away from the keyboard (as inconvenient as that may sound), go find some sexist people. Talk to them and see why it is that they are sexist, try to understand not preach. When you deal with people irl you will see it's not as easy as reading an article. Changing one persons belief can take years. But hey, that's not as easy as conjuring some illusory scenario where you are some sort of demi-god and can just type a few words to make some sort of snowball effect leading to the benefit of all man. (sorry, but I know you can take it)</p>

To make money you can perform tricks, run on a hamster wheel, brown nose your superiors or have a lucky break. To find an ethical solution, you must first find what is ethically correct.</p><p>With your sort of logic, we could break this down further: You could become a millionaire by making £/$100 a week for 10000 weeks.

                <p>I would say, why is that you want a million dollars so much? And to me it seems your the ones with the quick fix mentality. The metaphor is that the 'goal' of getting a million dollars would be the sexism to be eradicated. So I would say (and have said) that I do not want a million dollars. Not so much that, more that I do not have the means to make a million dollars. The metaphor is a little floppy because I have more sway in the decision to make a million (personal action will effect this). But that doesn't really add anything. The day we decide to all be the same is when we consent to enslaving ourselves.</p><p>Also I would like to thank the moderator. TBH I was thinking I was gonna get banned as soon as it was noticed. So it's nice to see there is a bit of tolerance about. I got banned for being ironic on the die2nite forum for 7 days, nothing offensive at all. So thanks. (The comment was to entice Workshop into addressing me again. Which he smartly avoided)</p>

But if they're being sexist, they are very likely to of been racist or generally abusive towards people in the past/future. But in the end it doesn't really matter if both are done by the same person or not, they are just both examples of the same offensive, anti-social behaviour. I group them together because if you've got a way of dealing with racism online then you can use that same method to deal with sexism online, and you can use that same method for general OTT abuse online.</p>

                <p>You can ban people for being abusive, whether it's sexism, racism or anything. Remember we are talking about ONLINE racism, sexism and general abuse, you seem to think I'm trying to say that the KKK are the same as a man that beats his wife because she "didn't have tea on the table when he finished work."</p><p>People have the same motivation when they are being racist than when they are being sexist, they want to offend people. Grouping them both together as "Offensive behaviour." If someone exhibits such behaviour they should be made to stop through some means such as a ban.</p><p>Usually, ONLINE, the cause of sexism/ racism, etc is the same. It's immoral people, throwing horrible comments around and thinking this is acceptable because they're behind a computer screen. They see the internet as some kind of digital wild west, where anything goes. I think <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Gyges">this</a> is a good analogy for why people cause such grief from the invisible comfort of their computer desk</p>

                <p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"> One thing I've noticed is that one of the articles states that the woman was playing Call of Duty. First Person Shooters with ranking systems are highly competitive games which are very stressful, especially Call of Duty. Combine the stress from the FPS and Console Wars going on within each of all the different games' communities and things tend to get heated fast. This is why it is much easier to get picked on playing Battlefield rather than something like Minecraft.</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"> Second thing I've noticed is that women tend to have a poorer skills when it comes to playing. I'm not saying all women are generally terrible players, but I've been trying to get my mother and sister into playing Left 4 Dead since it came out and they still haven't figured out how to properly work two joysticks just to simply move around (<img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> no one do any sexual puns).</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/chart.png" alt=":chart:" class="tid_ico"> This also goes in tune with my personal motto towards multiplayer gaming in general, "<em>Play to have fun, but only as long as it doesn't ruin the fun for others</em>". Usually you'd think this would only apply to griefing or trolling, but it also goes towards a person's skills. If you know you are a terrible gamer, try to stay away from the competitive gaming or at least play offline. I don't mean that to be insulting, but it just ruins the fun when you see your teammate walking into walls or killing themselves and their nearby teammates with grenades all the time. Being a 'noob' is a very easy way to become a target to the much more sexist or/and racist gamers since you become an excuse to why they "didn't win the game because this chick was out of the kitchen" or "they didn't get enough points because this Mexican was spending all his time hopping fences instead of arming the bomb" (These are similar examples from what I have seen and heard during my time in the competitive gaming world).</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico"> I don't really know too much about internet forums and games like WoW since I'm much more of a competitive gamer, but I know a few general tips about multiplayer gaming and the internet.<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"> One thing you should do whenever you play a game is to play with friends or at least good spirited people. Once you play a couple games with someone who doesn't seem like a total a**hole, send them a friend request and try game together often. Using this tactic, you usually can <a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/AQnIJ-ljctk">gang up on people being rude and hateful</a>. <br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico">Whenever mentioning something on the internet, always stick to things you absolutely know about or at least make it obvious you might not be sure about things and never argue unless you can prove things with facts. By trying to act smart, you're easy bait for trolls to use you to discriminate you <em>and</em> your gender/ethic on the internet.<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico">Follow, not lead. Never try to be the hero when playing team games. Work as a squad not as lone wolf trying to prove something. This is especially important if you are a noob and will make people less likely to bully you.<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico">The internet (and it's counterparts) is a <em>wretched hive of scum and villainy</em>. It's impossible to change this since it has such an immense freedom of speech, but this is also why it is so great. Although, not all hope is lost when it comes to slowing down the 'contamination' of hate and violence. There's a few steps to enhance both yours and another person's experience by... <br>- Always being kind and respectful to people you meet, even if they say you smell terrible and they had sexual intercourse with your mother last night. Arguing is only fuel to the fire and it will not end well, especially if they have friends.<br>- Back someone up if a player/user is being out of line, but always try to keep the situation calm. If you can't keep the situation calm, just back off and let other people throw the fireballs.<br>- Always help someone that is struggling to have fun. This can be achieved by switching teams if one side out numbers the other, even if they're losing. No game I have come across has ever taken points away from you for losing a match (although you wont get the extra points for winning it, they wont give you a negative score).<br>- If someone is picking on you for being a woman or a noob, go kick their butt. They'll be swallowing their words once everyone on the server sees that a "noob kicked that jerk's ass". Though you shouldn't get angry if you do fail to beat them. There is a high chance that they are in fact better than you and they might have back-up. <br><br><img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> I don't really like jumping into heated debates, but I felt like getting my 2 cents out there.</p>

And it would be hard to find someone to disagree. What I've been trying to reason is that do girls even give a fuck? Is there even a problem? I mean obviously insults are bad<img src="../../../../gfx/square/puke.png" alt="°x°" class="tid_ico"> but it is only a problem when there is harm caused. And my personal opinion is taking offence is not harm unless done to an extent where psychological damage is done. Sexism is bad, my job involves dealing with a lot of customers in home and you should see some of the woman. It's like off of American Beauty if you've seen it, the mum of the drug dealer. Like an empty shell sort of thing, due to the psychological trauma caused by the husband (most of these instances are couples over 60, 70 years old and I have yet to see a woman younger like this, they would simply tell the husband to get stuffed). You could argue that sexism online somehow promotes further damaging offences but I would just have to disagree.</p>

Because I wasn't sure whether I had enough money for what I needed, I decided to just do without and said I was all right actually (twas only beer :p) After insisting she can get it for me she said "I am a girl you know Ben, I <strong>DO</strong> know how to shop"</p><p>And then when I opened up my tobacco an hour or so later, I read the fact that is printed on the papers inside: "On average women say 7,000 words per day.

[...] This is why it is much easier to get picked on playing Battlefield rather than something like Minecraft.</p><br><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"> Second thing I've noticed is that women tend to have a poorer skills when it comes to playing. I'm not saying all women are generally terrible players, but I've been trying to get my mother and sister into playing Left 4 Dead since it came out and they still haven't figured out how to properly work two joysticks just to simply move around</p></cite><p>.</p><p>Alright so let's talk about this. I'm not sure how old you are but let's assume your 18. You've been playing games for what? 10 years? Controls come naturally to you.</p><p>I assume you often play games and have through that 10 year time span. You've grown up with a controller in your hand.</p><p>I am 31 years old, I'm in a generation of people where we were absolutely ridiculed for playing games. This means I have many friends male and female who don't play games or have rarely if ever played game. They're terrible, the have tons of trouble understanding the spacial movement in games.</p><p>I'm going to propose this to you, much like my non gamer friends, most females that play games that are bad at them are not bad because they are female... they are bad because they don't play often. I've known some damned good female players, but they played... as often as I did.</p><p>The point here is that gaming culture as a whole, if we want to believe it or not, thinks of women as inferior. It stems from MY generation (I'm not talking about late converts here, people who started playing wow at age 25). My generation growing up was shunned by the social world. We came to view women in a jaded perspective since we were admonished by them and looked down upon by them.</p><p>The games were our escape, but have become more and more sexualized over the years because sex sells. I personally noticed this with the release of tomb raider. That game had friends of mine whom had never played a game before sitting on my couch mesmerized by T&amp;A.</p><p>So much has changed, girls as they are being raised by guys like me are being allowed to play games (or discovering them on their own since they are so pervasive), but the root of all the sexism and bitterness is still there. It's transferred as younger gamers have dealt with older jaded gamers.</p><p>...</p><p>Ack, I'm off on a tangent there, sorry.</p>

                <p>Axiin, your tangent wasn't that bad! You brought up a good point (gaming culture being what it is due to marginalization in the past)</p><p>I actually was going to post some personal anecdotes, but I lost my post due to being distracted by writing PMs... I completely agree with your point about one's skill level at video games being the result of experience. It's literally impossible to argue that there's a gender difference in the realm of "having the capacity to play video games"</p><br><p>Now, here's something for you guys to look at, so you can either feel embarrassed or confused: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIGHgVyrRB4" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIGHgV...</a></p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">None of the female characters are wearing something other than their "default" outfit, while several of the male characters are wearing something different than their default (which is appropriate to their current situation)</span></p><p>Things like that are embarrassing. One could argue that this was done to have a "seamless" transition between the cutscene and gameplay, but apparently some of the non-standard outfits for the guys aren't actually available for you to use in-game</p>

                <p>lol others were swearing in this thread and a joke post/swear gets warned, weird.</p><p>Great articles, Workshop, love them!! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1821814 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1821814">MadDonut</span></span><cite><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/question.png" alt=":?:" class="tid_ico"> One thing I've noticed is that one of the articles states that the woman was playing Call of Duty. First Person Shooters with ranking systems are highly competitive games which are very stressful, especially Call of Duty. Combine the stress from the FPS and Console Wars going on within each of all the different games' communities and things tend to get heated fast. This is why it is much easier to get picked on playing Battlefield rather than something like Minecraft.</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico"> Second thing I've noticed is that women tend to have a poorer skills when it comes to playing. I'm not saying all women are generally terrible players, but I've been trying to get my mother and sister into playing Left 4 Dead since it came out and they still haven't figured out how to properly work two joysticks just to simply move around (<img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"> no one do any sexual puns).</p></cite><p>Funny how you point out situations where we don't play as well. How about when I kick ass in a game like Borderlands or RE5 and my gamer tag being obviously female I get all sorts of messages like, "I can own you anytime I want." etc etc</p><p>Difference is between your scenario and mine, you seem to think in your scenario the insults are somehow justified. Or, something.</p><p>How many men your mother's age would do any better than she does? Maybe your sister is like this young man I know who hates FPSs.... Like Axiin says, more men play more games therefor they are better. I have many games on the xbox I've almost gained 100% on becasue I worked at getting good at them not becasue I'm some silly female anomaly who is inexplicably good at video games.</p><p>I'm not even going to comment on switerland or crayolapots' posts because they aren't really here to discuss the topic.</p><p>from the gamasutra article this point sticks out, "here is no anger quite like that of the privileged. Here we see it in the raw. In this instance; "We heterosexual males like boobs in our games, and we'll be damned if you're going to take them away." Because they feel threatened, they lash out without thinking about it, like a dog that thinks you want to take its bone away. The behavior seems nonsensical, but it's predictable." There is nothing more scary than having your power threatened and men have financial, physical and political power in this world and they want to keep it.</p><p>I still don't see why faced with all the evidence men (and plenty of women who have drunk the patriarchal kool-aid) say sexism in gaming, and most if not all societies in general, is not an issue. Women are killed by their so called partners and predators at an alarming rate in so called developed countries still. Yet, I don't really see outrage. Not many are standing up and say "why?" or "this must stop!". Making women into objects for sexual gratification in video games feeds this under valuing of women in it's own awful way. Nice niche game developers! /sarcasm.</p><p>I used to play a tonne of xbox games and enjoyed them for the fun and always cringed when faced with tits and ass for the sake of it but I'm seriously fed up with the lack of representation. I don't want to see women portrayed as nit wits and shrews in Red Dead Redemption, I'm sick of seeing Sheva in high heels and asking meat head Chris for advice, because damn, Chris isn't a smart man why not make her at least smart if we can't have her clothed? Mostly, women are just sexy after thoughts in video games, so tired of it.</p><p>I did enjoy Lara Croft games. They came at a time when you were hard pressed to find a female protagonist in any game and I enjoyed playing as a women. While she is dressed like stripper and her boobs seem to be anatomically impossible for handstands, she doesn't use her sexuality to get what she wants. It's almost like the devs dressed her that way but she is awesome in spite of it. I was really excited for the new Tomb Raider game but was unaware of the use of potential sexual violence as a plot point. You see, almost/potential rape scenes aren't fun for me. Really! How ridiculous. I bet the devs feel it's 'empowering' to have her escape that tragedy. It's the exact opposite as the description of the scene is sexually charged which only serves to titillate and imo glorify rape at the very least as entertainment at worst as being A-Ok.</p>

                <p>I don't mean to justify sexism. In fact, I'd be glad if some of the straight up 'junk' in video games were removed. I was only saying why it was there. Yes, a lot of people just don't have enough experience playing games, but the multiplayer community is brutal on those poor of playing and I guess it's rubbed off on me. I would be glad to see more women, more people even, my kicking ass, but I have shit internet and can't get onto online games. I'm also pretty damn skilled in video games. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I could play some old school Call of Duty 3 as the Anti-Armor class and still get up to 32 kills.</p>

                <p>hi, TailsTheeFox, thank you. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Seems such an odd turn for Lara Croft to take. I adored Guardian of Light, the other departure.</p><p>MadDonut, really, you aren't justifying sexism but just bad behaviour in general to a degree so I apologize for framing my comments in that context.</p><p>You'll find more women playing more video games (and getting better) when most of us don't have to work full time jobs, take on the domestic work and mostly raise the children while our partners focus on their careers and weekend "play".

                <p>One thing I have noticed about women gamers is that they often have family members who are the primary gamer.</p><p>I have thought for a while and I think I know why.</p><p>It is the same reason that you rarely see a baby boy with a tutu.<br>Or a baby girl with a tool-belt.</p><p>When you are very young you do not have a lot going for you.<br>You get two labels. 'Baby' and 'Gender'. <br>The exception to this is your (usually) parent/guardian, who (hopefully) notice more about their children.</p><p>So things tend to be bought for them. Then the child enjoys them.<br>They have fun because they want to have fun. They can't tell a car from a doll.<br>When all you have is a nail, everything starts to look like a hammer.</p><p>So the carers notice this. They see that<em> -child- </em>likes <em>-object-</em>. <br>So they think "I'll get him another <em>-object-</em>". So the child grows up with those <em>-objects-</em>. Which tends to make them enjoy the company of <em>-objects-</em>.</p><p>So it all starts (as most things do) in the beginning.<br>The choice of the object (or objects).</p><p>How many parents of girls will choose a videogame?<br>How many parents of boys will choose a needle and thread?</p><p>Too few.</p><p>And after the choice is made it is too late.</p><p><em>Warning! The following contains gross exaggeration. Please avert your eyes.<br></em><br>Men are <em>never</em> taught to sow. Men are <em>never</em> taught to clean.</p><p>The same applies to women.</p><p>They are<em> never </em>taught to sport. They are<em> never</em> taught to game.</p><p>Because that's not how it's done!</p><br><p>As a final note, I would like to point out that I am adept at sowing and cleaning because they are very important skills. <br>And because their is no way in hell that my mother or sister would do it for me.</p><p>My sister, for one, is busy showing people that the fastest way to halo hell is moving into her way.</p>

                <p>Thank you Workshop! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><cite>from the gamasutra article this point sticks out, "here is no anger quite like that of the privileged. Here we see it in the raw. In this instance; "We heterosexual males like boobs in our games, and we'll be damned if you're going to take them away." Because they feel threatened, they lash out without thinking about it, like a dog that thinks you want to take its bone away. The behavior seems nonsensical, but it's predictable." There is nothing more scary than having your power threatened and men have financial, physical and political power in this world and they want to keep it.</cite><p>I said this then went onto something else, ha. I meant to tie this into violence against women comments I made. The article quote above describes something that is really disturbing to watch. When women speak out about how we are portrayed and treated within the gaming community women the backlash is disturbing. It's no surprise to me that these women are often threatened with violence and even berated by other women. Which is shitty in itself, that we expect this type of behaviour. We can say it's anonymous trolls on the internet but, you know, it's not. Often people will comment using their non-anonymous Facebook accounts and feel completely justified.</p><p>So, seeing this, how can anyone say this isn't an issue? How deep seeded the attitudes of entitlement for boobies must be for us to perpetuate and tolerate these seemingly mainstream attitudes.</p><p>Hannelor, there is a family here in Canada who doesn't define their child by gender, no one outside their family knows it. It's awesome lol! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I don't know much about the family, none of my business really, but I'm sure no one gives gender based toys or teaches gender based tasks!</p><p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/genderless-baby-controversy-mom-defends-choice-reveal-sex/story?id=13718047#.UB8RTUTMFsQ" target="_blank">http://abcnews.go.com/Health/genderle...</a></p>

It sounds like they are bringing the child up in an environment without ANY relation to gender. I mean if the child was a boy and they raised it as a girl then yes, it could cause serious problems later on in the child's life (if only because the general public may not be accepting of it). However it sounds like they are saying:</p><br><p>"It is a bouncing baby... person!!...Boy or girl? Don't worry about it, it is a person! What? Oh you want to go outside and play with a football? Sure go have fun! Oh you are tired and want to stay inside and play with Barbie dolls? Sure go have fun!" (intentionally using stereotypes of guys playing football and girls playing with dolls to get my point across)</p><br><p>It isn't like it is a boy and they are saying "NO! You have to wear nothing but dresses!" It sounds as though they are just letting the kid do whatever it wants with no real input other then support. I don't believe they are forcing the child one way or the other. As for when the child gets older they hopefully won't force it into anything then either. Hopefully if the child decides to let it's gender be known to everyone then they will let "it" however that won't be seen till later.</p><br><p>I am actually interested in how this turns out. Over the years I have had many ideas that I thought about to myself, usually they are based on the whole "nature vs. nurture" thing. Many of the ideas usually end up with if a child was in a world by itself with no influence from any other human how would _____ aspect of their personality develop. How much of us is influenced by what we hear around us and how much of it is programmed into our DNA? To use our other conversation as an example: if I grew up alone, away from tv and other people, as a guy would I still be attracted to breasts, butts, etc. because it is in my DNA or is that from hearing and seeing those body parts be sexualized over the years.</p><br><p>Those trains of thought always end with me sighing and thinking well it is a great thought experiment but that is as far as it can go because if I were to ever test it I would be possibly ruining a human being's life or if not ruining it then at the very least impacting it in a huge way with no input from that human. Now if we could invent a machine to reverse someones age then we could get consent from an adult then revert them to a baby <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"> As for whether or not this story falls into that category of ruining the baby's life or not, no one is certain, that is part of the reason why there is controversy. The parent's believe the only effect it will have is that the child will not know any gender stereotypes. Whether or not that will be the only effect remains to be seen.</p><br><p>Edit: heh took so long to type this message two more posts appeared...</p>

While there is no doubt mistreatment of women that are still prevalent that need to be addressed, we should be careful not to automatically assume that all women are victimised in some way, lest real cases of victimisation become undermined.</p>

The question was whether sexism is still mainstream. That example did not prove it was <em>mainstream</em>, just only that it existed. If she or you who suggested that teaching girls to please men is still mainstream gave some more solid evidence, I'd believe that. The only examples I can think of where teaching girls to serve men is mainstream would be the Middle East and parts of Southeast Asia.</cite><br>Again, another well made point... Although it's quite extreme in places such as Saudi Arabia, sexism happens here in the states on a smaller, yet less extreme scale. Think about it, it's mainstream enough for the conversation about it to last this long with only a few contributors and to ruin a great deal of otherwise good games... Although one could go into great detail about sexism, we're talking about games here. Which have been proven in this thread that games are dominated by males(in quantity) and that a great deal of these males tend to attack females online verbally. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I believe almost all of these has been covered...

Once you did, I was done, but you immediately asked if I was desperately trying to blame women. Even if you asked that in good faith, the fact you even asked that question suggests there is a possibility I was trying to blame women. What's even worse is that when I denied that charge, <em>you called me delusional</em>. If you truly asked in good faith, why didn't you accept what I told you I was doing the first time?</p><br><p>Also, Annette mentioned that women who "allow" themselves to be objectified were products of a patriarchal society and they were only choosing based on how they were taught. As I said, that's true for many cases, but I wasn't talking about those cases. This leads to next step - are there exceptions to that? If so, then no disagreements. However, there was no acknowledgement at that point some women simply chose at will. Annette mentioned money and approval, but some of those people could go to other routes if that was their goal, could they not?</p>

                <p>Seeing as this thread has been revived, I really have to put a question forward.</p><p>I get sexism as a discrimination in classes and ranks. I don't necessarily agree with it, but I do somehow see it "makes sense." What I don't get is why is the sexism so extremely abusive?</p><p>Only browsed through the first 2 or 3 pages because 16 pages is a big deal to read at 2 am, but in Hannelor's case, the change in name was significant enough to reduce the abuse by a lot. Why? It's not like we're conditioned over generations to beat women up and verbally abuse them.</p>

                <p>Well first of all, the author is basing her piece on apparent misinterpretations of sexism. Having a top ten of the hottest female scientists could be amusing amongst friends but one can also see how it is potentially reducing female scientists to their appearance and how it can reinforce sexist stereotypes.<br>From there, you can say "yeah it's amusing but.." and appreciate everyone's point of view.</p><p>But I mean, so what?...</p><p>Yeah you'll find thousands of people misreading and misquoting because they are over analysing things or because they want to push their point across first and foremost. And this doesn't help conversation. <br>This, of course, would happen on both sides.</p><p>Now I agree that some people seem to find offense everywhere all the time and feel they have to lecture the crap out of you day in day out. That drives me nuts too.</p><p>I also agree that <br>"<em>The urge to objectify is universal, and so long as it's fairly and respectfully indulged, it's not offensive, not a problem, and not news.</em>", as Savage said. He's a far better and more balanced writer than the blogtroll quoting him though.</p><br><p>Of course the main issue in this present thread is female gamers abused, harrassed or continuously bothered online simply for being females. I personally see it as a lot more annoying that a potentially harmless collection of the top ten hottest whatever.</p><br><p>My major issue with the blog entry you submitted is the tone and the stereotypification of feminists and feminism. <br>It seems quite clear that the author has a bit of an agenda to start with and is more than willing to apply old aggressive and mistaken generalisations such as that feminists think of women as being defenseless victims. <br>A bit like your white knight comment.</p><p>Paragraphs such as <cite>Which brings me to the other half of the sexual objectification equation. You know, the one feminists have never heard of or thought about because they're too busy admiring their own vaginas in a completely non-objectifying way, unlike you disgusting men who are only interested in SEX.</cite>are a good example of what I am trying to say.</p><p>She is flattering the mysoginistic anti-feminist status-quo to score cheap shots based on half truths.</p><p>As such, I will gladly confess I only read the first third of the article and then just scrolled down to the conclusion and felt pleased with myself for not wasting my time.</p><p>Feel free to summarise for me what the second half of the blog entry is saying, preferably in reasonable words <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

I don't agree with him, so I am called a sexist and what not.</p><p>And yeah I agree that it's fine to find someone attractive or to make yourself look attractive.

                <p>Knight's article is humorous and interesting where as girlwriteswhat's is hateful, really. Where does she get her information from? She's just making half that crap up I'm sure. She cites no real evidence for her conclusions, she's just making it up to suit her ideas. I agree with Workshop's assessment of the post. I had a hard time understanding what she was indeed trying to say until I read some of her other articles. Her agenda is pretty loud and clear.</p><p>In the article posted here, to me she seems to mostly be saying that it's ok to objectify women and women should just shut up about it because women do it to themselves and men. Well, no, no one should be objectifying anyone. That's just asshole and disrespectful behaviour and it can be done by both genders. Savage is wrong too. You can be sexually attracted to someone and not objectify them. Let's look at the wiki definition (may be accurate!) "Sexual objectification refers to the practice of regarding or treating another person merely as an instrument (object) towards one's sexual pleasure, and a sex object is a person who is regarded simply as an object of sexual gratification." Key words being "merely" and "simply". The sole purpose of your existence if for the sexual gratification of someone else. The fact that the person you are objectifying might not welcome your single mindedness doesn't seem to matter nor does that fact that all people have more worth than just their fuckability.</p><p>She's spouting the same old crap about how we make ourselves attractive then bitch because we are hooted at. Hooting at someone is just rude and goes straight to the point that the hooter is not respecting the hooted. If you did respect that person and found them attractive you would maybe strike up a conversation, introduce yourself, etc.</p>

If someone is giving you unwanted attention I think you have every right to feel threatened or uncomfortable. The thing is that nowadays we <strong>KNOW</strong> the things we should and shouldn't do. I'm pretty sure most people can and do resist the instinct to look at someone as a sexual object. However, on the internet people lose some of their self restraint because they think they'll never get punished for saying things they would get punished for in real life.</p>

                <p>I understand she was saying men react this way because of evolution. You must have missed where I said she cites no evidence for her evolutionary assertions. There are indeed fiction, stuff she's made up, also, she's spouting rhetoric from the "men's movement". I may also add I'm a stanch evolutionist, creationism is just mere fantasy.</p><p>I said "hooting" but my point stands for "gazing" as well. Workshop again said it well. It is indeed about rape. Now, the real point you made that has me literally laughing out loud:<br> <br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_1181613 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1181613">grinic</span></span><cite><br>Does it happen every two weeks or how much is regular?</cite></p><p>There this interesting statistic, 30% of all murdered women are murdered by an intimate partner. On another note, 3% of all murdered men were killed by their intimate female partner. Now, I'm not sure if that includes rape. But, to say what you said above is indeed laughable because violence against women happens all the time. And, our society as a whole doesn't really seem to care. Anytime a a man kills his wife/girl friend here locally (happens quite often) it's a blip on the news. No outrage, no royal commissions. It's just the norm. I do realise we aren't really talking about this specifically but I think it's an interesting fact.</p><p>But, now, let's talk about rape! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> lol It does happen in my country "every two weeks" indeed. A rape is reported by 11 women a week. I have no idea how many of these rapes were perpetrated in the manner you describe, but really, does it matter? You are talking out of your bum anyway.</p><p>Honestly, feminism not a direct attack on maleness it's about equality and respect, full stop. And, your reaction to it is based on fear and ignorance.</p>

                <p>grinic, do you boost yourself and feel manly when you believe crap like that article? I see he's countering the idea that men are not necessary. Which is bs, of course men are needed.

                <p><cite>All of this behavior reflects two things: men’s genuine fear of being challenged and confronted, and the persistence of the stereotype of feminists as being aggressive "man-bashers." The painful thing about all this, of course, is that no man is in any real physical danger in the classroom — or even outside of it — from feminists. Name one incident where an irate women’s studies major physically assaulted a male classmate for something he said? Women are regularly beaten and raped — even on college campuses — but I know of no instance where a man found himself a victim of violence for making a sexist remark in a college feminist setting! "Male-bashing" doesn’t literally happen, in other words, at least not on campus. But that doesn’t stop men from using (usually half in jest) their own exaggerated fear of physical violence to make a subtle point about feminists.</cite></p><p>I love this from that article, Workshop. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> I'm not sure what some people are so concerned about with feminism. It's not going to sneak in and take your first born or all your Oreos, even.</p><p>I read this recently, it's pretty interesting - <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/09/10/sexist-comments-from-video-gamers/" target="_blank">http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/...</a> and the update to this article -</p><p><cite>UPDATE: Several commenters have pointed out that men also get comments like at least some of these. That is absolutely true. Insults of a wide and creative variety are thrown around. But these comments, whether targeted at men or women, illustrate a common cost of admission to online gaming: whether a man or a woman, you have to expect sexist, demeaning, violent insults if you want to play. Those are the informal rules of the game.</cite></p><p>I know have a lot of guy gamer friends and I can say that none have ever expressed an experience where they were threatened with rape or their gender was attacked. That update makes me sad because it seems to be pandering. :\ Oh well, the article is an interesting snippet none the less.</p>

                <p>This concept is explained rather well, Anglophone. "Interchangeability is a common advertising theme that <strong>reinforces the idea that women, like objects, are fungible. And like objects, “more is better,” a market sentiment that erases the worth of individual women.</strong>" A photograph of team where people are wearing similar gear is not the same thing. For one those in your shot aren't selling anything at all nor are they almost naked. Or, if you prefer, you could argue the people in that photo are also being objectified. The point is the VS model picture is one of the most blatant and easy to spot objectifying marketing tactics. Robert Palmer used this visual in his music videos as well.</p>

                <p>Sorry Anglophone, I don't understand your comparison with Footy captains. Which makes me think there is something you are misunderstanding or misinterpreting in the article?</p><p>Footy captains are not sexualized in your picture, for one.</p><p>Also, footy players aren't victims of sexual harassment (in fact it's totally the other way round, especially at Saint Kilda and Carlton, huh) and don't live in a society mostly dominated by females or with strong traditions that demand the footy player does the house chores and mostly exists to serve women.<br>The footy players are valued and recognised for their skills, their football brains, their discipline and their strength, they're not generally used around to represent a piece of flesh ready to be exploited and taken by the opposite sex. Whenever they are photographed, even when they are posing for magazines, they are made to look in control and active, not passive and slave-like, with their faces covered and nothing but their short shorts on display.</p>

YO thats totally sexist to males and shows that videogames are only for chicks and they are trying to push guys out of videogames!</cite><br>That is what we call a false equivalence. The two are not equal. The depiction of both male and female characters are both designed to appeal to a male audience. Most of the women-folk are designed to be conventionally attractive to the male audience. The men-folk likewise are designed as a power fantasy. What we would like to look like rather than what would make them conventionally attractive.</p><p>The important thing to note is that the audience for both is the same. The preferences of roughly half the fanbase (I'm told? I'm never great with statistics.) is ignored.</p><p>Furthermore, the fact that they exist is not the problem. The fact that they are the overwhelming majority is. Consider the male cast of a typical game. You'll find a range of heights'n'weights'n'builds. Then consider the female cast. Odds are it'll be thin'n'busty with variously low amounts of clothes. Certain games avoid this, but the majority don't.</p><p>Exceptions exist, of course. Exceptions always exist. That's not the point. The problem is of the overwhelming majority. Of the culture, Of how the mindset of those who live in it.</p><p>It is small things. Like using "dyke" as an insult. It is the background levels of "feminine is bad". Constant demands of sandwich-making. The cascade of rape jokes that accompany any high pitched voice. These horrible, unacceptable things are normalized. This makes them harder to fight.</p><p>Feminism is about equality. Always has been. It means that all-folk can be expected to be treated and depicted equally.</p><p>That means a wide range of male characters. Not just bloated walls of muscle.<br>That means a wide range of female characters. Not just half-naked breast-boards.</p><p>The difference is that we already have the former everywhere. <br> So we're working on the latter.</p>

                <p>So where's the line, then? If such characters are acceptable so long as they aren't the only type of characters, who's at fault? No individual is responsible for every female character, and if it's acceptable for SOME of them to be the damsel in distress, then who's doing anything wrong? Women are not exclusively the damsel, and men are not exclusively the hero.</p>

I feel my opinion IS some of my business.</p></cite><p>1. OK, so sexism / misogyny in video games and amongst gamers goes far beyond the stereotype of the damsel in distress but since this is what you want to talk about here goes. <br>Well, it IS promoting a sexist stereotype. The helpless woman who absolutely MUST have a man in her life to save her and look after her. It's constant in video games. It is one of many aspects that helps put women down and gives a signal that women are somewhat inferior.</p><p>It is a cultural thing, like anti-Jewish racism or anti-Arab racism is cultural in parts of the world or in some circles or families. I don't understand why you want to be able to pinpoint one person who might be responsible for it? Of course, it would be simple and easy to fix then but I'm not so sure that anything on Earth has got one person responsible for it???</p><p>As a cultural prejudice, it is up to you and me and everyone else to <strong>stop </strong>accepting it and embracing it and supporting it and defending it as soon as someone questions it. Games can be in every way just as good, or heaps better, without the misogynist / sexist agenda. And if you still think that means being anti-men... well... no, I hope you don't...</p><p>2&amp;3 - So<strong> you cannot</strong> quote where she says that violence against men is ok. Because she's not saying it and she's not saying anything even remotely insinuating it. <br>I am sorry, but It might well be in your twisted perception of feminism. You want it to be anti-men so you are looking for things you can perceive as being anti-men.</p><p>4 - If your opinion is your business, why is it the author's business then? It's YOUR opinion, isn't it?<br>Anyway, it's already been explained to you why we believe it makes perfect sense that comments are not allowed on the page of the article. <br>I kindly invite you to read the few things I posted at the very start of this thread, about how much abuse/harassment most women are getting just for playing online.</p><p>_____<br><strong>I digress</strong>: How old are you anyway to 'demand' that you can put your opinion everywhere you want? I'm asking this, not to be rude, I promise, but because not so long ago it was fairly normal and widely accepted that the average joe can't publish their "opinion" about everything everywhere.<br>It's the problem with the Internet that everyone thinks their opinion is in every way as valid as anybody else. Well, it's not. Someone who has researched something, is an expert in a specific field, may have done peer reviewed research will have a much more interesting and relevant opinion than the average joe who's never thought about something for more than 10 seconds, if that.</p><p>I am NOT talking about you here with the 10 seconds thing and I am not saying the author we are talking about is some genius, I was simply illustrating my point about "opinions" and the Internet.</p><p>Having a conversation on a forum is different - that's what forums are for. It's logical that everyone can take part and express their opinion. Still, not opinions are equal even there.<br>On a blog or an online publication, being able to post a comment is optional. Getting upset because you can't is rude.</p><p>It reminds me of two quotes I came across again recently on Faceboook:</p><p>- “Anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.'” (Isaac Asimov)</p><p>and - “All opinions are not equal. Some are a very great deal more robust, sophisticated and well supported in logic and argument than others.” (Douglas Adams)</p><p>I hope I am making some sense <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

It involves questioning your position at the top of the food chain and accepting that sexism is still a real issue, and this in itself might be brutal for some. As such, they interpret it as it being anti-whatever they are... "men"?</p>

You don't see males complain about not being sold makeup because few males demand makeup and there isn't anything inherently anti-male about makeup. In the case of video games, there is a significant and growing demand from females for video games, but many video games are inherently misogynistic in their treatment of female characters, giving female gamers a legitimate reason to complain about the persistent misogynistic sector of the gaming community.<br>There is also a difference between marketing for a particular gender versus marketing by degrading and/or objectifying a particular gender. Gaming companies could easily create games directed towards male gamers without including elements that show or imply male dominance against women.<br>You want to talk about profitability? Consider the fact that some of the best-selling games are those directed toward a general audience. Sure, a company could gain some customers by including misogynistic themes, but that company would also alienate away many more potential customers against such themes.</p>

She doesn't have comments on her videos because she gets fucking death threats, you idiots. She's not asking for your feedback nor does she need it. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> Deal with it.</p><p>With women dying and abused at such an alarming rate, it's an epidemic and this crap in games just perpetuates the fact that this is just normal shit, no big deal. When, we should all be outraged.</p><p>Back to video games, those of us who would like to see smart, engaging and compelling women characters in games aren't asking for much. We just want to be represented realistically. It's scary, I know!!</p><p>Egin, Workshop won the argument, my condolences for your loss, buddy. He's been amazingly patient, mad props to him and Hannelor as well.</p><p>I can take solace in the fact Workshop is raising his kids with these values and not the haters in this thread. I watched Anita's videos with my son and we talked about at length in an ongoing conversation. He won't fear women or equality, he'll be taught equality is as good for him as the women in his life.</p><p>I've noticed men speaking out against the problems regarding women in games more and more, even in the last six months it just feels different, it's awesome! Many men are writing articles decrying the status quo, it's not just women anymore. This is where the message needs to come from at this point, it's not getting through with just women talking about it, and it's heartwarming to see it happening. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Sirron, there are very few, that's the point.</p><p>BlackVoid, watching the way women are brutally murders as a lazy plot device in games is disgusting. To a degree, it helps normalize and perpetuate violence against women. Watching many of these incidents compressed in Anita's video (the 2nd mostly) was hard to watch. Women are powerless in these games and the men have control over their destiny, it's absolutely not the same though violence is an issue for sure, that's not the gd point of this conversation. It's not that most devs. are assholes, they are just lazy. But, that doesn't make it less of a problem.</p>

To a degree, it helps normalize and perpetuate violence against women. Watching many of these incidents compressed in Anita's video (the 2nd mostly) was hard to watch. Women are powerless in these games and the men have control over their destiny, it's absolutely not the same though violence is an issue for sure, that's not the gd point of this conversation.

                <p>What I find interesting is the options you have when customizing a character. Take Startrek MMO for example. Sure create a female character, you can customize he bust size, her hip thickness, hell even her her lip size, just about every sexual characteristic. I wish I had a screenshot of the hideously sexual homunculus type character I created... it was absurd.</p><p>Options are far more limited for males, I could go from waif thin to muscle bound brute, no option to be a jolly Scotty (in fact no option to have have any sort of body fat on either sexes from what I recall). No option to increase my groin bulge if I chose, yet tits could be larger than heads on female characters wtf.</p><br><p>I'm 32 years old, I've been playing games since commodore 64, I've watched games become more and more sexualized. Metroid is a perfect example, a game where the gender of the character did not matter, a bad assed female character turned into a sniveling co-dependent boot lick who needs her man to save her.</p><p>It's disrespectful, unrealistic, caters to people who think women are nothing more than burdens designed to by sperm absorption / baby making units.</p><p>I've dated a female gamer, and the stories she's told me about how men treat her... it's pathetic. She played CS with me every day, she was as good if not better than some of my male clan mates, but if she had a bad day playing everyone shat on her cuz she was female, said women can't play games etc.</p><p>It's absolutely pathetic to suggest that developers should push out content without thought to what stereotypes they're enforcing. Games as an interactive media have far more power over the perceptions of people. I'm not suggesting that the industry be regulated or required to do something, but I find it despicable that they choose to cater to the mouth breathing public all in the name of money. Games have the power to advance society and change peoples minds. To make them reevaluate their prejudices or to reinforce them. Publishers need to know that there are people out there like Workshop or myself or the countless of other people rallying for better characters/writing. They need to understand that the silent majority, the ones who love and respect their Mothers, their wives and their daughters think this is an important topic.</p><p>Shame on anyone that fights against this! SHAME ON THEM what motive do they have? Misogynistic close minded enjoyment? Screw them and their over empowered sense of entitlement. Men are just more than chests and crotches, women are more than just tits and asses. More accurate portrayal of bodies and more diverse personalities in games will only benefit BOTH sexes.</p><p>So why? Why say that it's stupid that women shouldn't be so blatantly objectified and sexualized? WHY? What does it hurt you if a female character is something other than a whiny do nothing that needs a male protagonist to save her? <br>Why would you fight against people that want that diversity? What do you stand to lose?!</p>

                <p>Hey MadDonut! Let's see if I can read Workshop's mind for you.<br>I'm pretty good at mind reading.</p><p>We've had a bit of discussion over the problems caused by a pervasively sexist culture. Music is a part of our culture, and has similar problems to the gaming industry.</p><p>We've also had comments saying that sexism wasn't an issue as it didn't extend outside of video games, or into modern problems.</p><p>Workshop's lovely link tries to show that discrimination is very much a part of our culture, even today. More importantly the fact that music has virtually identical problems suggests that these problems extend outside of the individual industries (Woo! Extrapolation!)</p><p>As to the point of this discussion? I believe it has been diluted. I think all five of your options would help further the discussion.</p><p>That help at all?</p>

                <p>Well to give my 'female' 2cents.</p><p>I have a xbox, bought it late although I have wanted one for several years / ever since I can remember. Partially because of the general opinion that girls should not be gamer and even though I have never experienced the kind of sexism from the articles, I do have felt unwelcome in the gaming world.<br>Now I refrain from shooters like COD because I don;t like them that much, but more I don't like the hate I see when I watch my male friends play.<br>The problem as a girl is that it is not that easy to 'survive' in a world like that. Insult are not that easily returned, because I feel (correct me if I'm wrong) that a lot of insults can only be used for females. Other abuse is (usually) not gender specific.</p><p>I have never encountered actual abuse that bad, but probably nothing would prepare me for when I do. I do believe you will desensitize after a while and that trash talk is part of the competitive gaming experience, but it probably would ruin it for me.</p><p>I am not a expert gamer, though I'm not bad either and I do refrain from certain games online for that reason too. I know how de-motivating it can be to do something and be super-competitive and some noob fucks it up. But when I fuck up, it's because im a girl. When a noob fucks up, he's a noob.</p><p>As for games self to be promoting sexism. I actually like boobs in a game and I like to play with a sexy female character. But don't push it. Boobs that slap her in the face every time she runs is not realistic.</p><br><p>Probably useless comment as the topic is probably dead <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

If you find yourself in a game with a like COD you're going to get insults regardless of you gender. This is just part of the ... erm ... "culture". Most of the time they insult people for being female because calling them noobs gets redundant. girl/fag/noob/nigger/etc is interchangeable and the insult itself bears little meaning.</p><p>Maybe I'm just more immune to this stuff than you because I'm used to throwing around [good natured] insults with friends.</p><p>Meanwhile, over in the boobs argument...

Women who support these issues are abused not because they're showing support but because haters know sexism will strike a nerve with them.</p></cite><p>That is a really short-sighted comment to me. Saying we all should not pay attention to the abusers. It's like saying we should not give racism so much attention, because that is what the abusers want. So we just all should not get offended and fuck everything. If that works for you, good for you. But that is not the point here.</p><p>Then again, you have no idea what the 'haters' think and what their motives are to abuse. You cannot generalize a group and not back it up with facts. That's exactly what they are doing. Some do it to troll yes, I noticed the trolling immediately and I do realize he probably(!, probably, since you cannot know for sure) send me that msg cus I replied on this forum. But if someone puts up a forummsg saying he hates racism, will he get msgs about how he is a dumb nigger and should move back to africa? I personally don't think so.</p><p>Also, you're saying the abuse is part of the culture, and I agree to some level. But I do believe that the issue is more that girls are not accepted to be players and therefor abused, not because they are noobs. And also, the fact that the abuse is a problem now, might be because the 'girls' take offence, where the boys did not.</p><p>That doesn't mean that it wasn't a problem before, more that no one complained. Maybe there are loads of gamers who hate that part of the gaming experience, but for other reasons did not stick up for them selfs. Abuse, to me, is not really OK in any kind of 'culture' when anyone takes offence. Giving female abuse 'special' attention is because a large group of females are offended and that makes it an issue. If a large group of gay gamers are offended, they would receive more attention as well.</p>

This is why I think women receive more abuse, not because these people genuinely don't accept women.</cite></p><p>WHY does being female open up more avenues for offenders to take?</p><p>Why is this ok?</p><p>You've basically said, Yep, women are bigger targets cuz they're women and your solution is to basically grow thicker skin</p><p>This is not an acceptable solution.</p><p>I'm not suggesting that people need to tip toe around offensive behavior (that does nothing to resolve actual perceptions) but developers need to be called out for portraying women in an unrealistic manner both visually (TnA such as MUSH suffers from) and writing (such as newer metroid games suffer from).</p><p>I'm not suggesting that all roles and visuals need to be Politically Correct, but people would be up in arms if African Americans were portrayed like this (<a href="http://themodernmarvelous.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/coon.jpg)" target="_blank">http://themodernmarvelous.files.wordp...</a> <br>Why is it ok to portray women like this?<br><a href="http://gaygamer.net/images/It__s_Not_That_Sexy__Really_by_Celtzombie.jpg" target="_blank">http://gaygamer.net/images/It__s_Not_...</a></p><p>Costumes like that exists to make ME happy, not women. It gives the impression that women are here to serve my needs and my wants, it reinforces the idea that they are objects.</p><p>It lets people like the ass hole that threatened Herose91 because she said something to express her actual personality. That shows lack of respect, solely based on her gender, and the pathetic excuses for visuals and characters that we've given to females in video games does NOTHING to help change their perceptions and simply reinforces them.</p><p>Lastly ask yourself this, what's the BEST insult you can come up for to dis-empower a white male? "White trash" "Cracker" "Fag"? There are none that have any REAL power because being white, and male, and straight is "Normal"</p><p>We need to remove the idea that being different makes you less than. We need to call out and shame people who choose to live ignorantly to inflate their own egos so they don't have to realize that other people are ALSO the protagonists of their own stories not just characters in their world to be taken from.</p>

It hasn't been brought up in depth since the latest necro and I don't have anything new to add on the subject that hasn't already been said so I didn't say anything.

The fact that "female" is often a personality on it's own troubles me. It bothered me before the dawn of gaming in a variety of medians. I agree that it's most prominent today in games alone, not that the problem isn't present elsewhere. I never find myself sympathizing with any female characters because the "female" personalities are so different than my own.

                <p>I just now saw this thread and already know I'm going to enjoy eventually reading all 32 pages.</p><p>As a female gamer, I've been on the receiving end of harassment in other games. I then started creating only male characters, which pretty much eliminated the harassment until people would find out I was female. However, almost every male I've interacted with has been completely respectful, with an occasional harmless joke about my gender. Harassment definitely has not been the norm, but it's something you remember when it does happen. And for <em>those</em> times I found that directly confronting the person early on pretty much stops the harassment in its tracks. I suggest anyone experiencing harassment in games try that tactic.</p><p>As a player of Die2Nite I was wondering if changing my avatar to a scantily clad female would prompt some of the males to send me stuff like bandages and drugs, but I have a feeling that game doesn't attract that kind of male gamer.

                <p>the levels of harassment vary greatly depending on the nature of the games and the existing 'culture' within. The last few pages at least were regarding games with audio communication (thus you can't 'hide' or be mistaken as male)</p><p>It's good that you brought up pretending to be male. It reminds me of an incident from a few years back. The game was far more social than MT. My username wasn't gender specific and I never bothered to correct any pronouns so everyone just assumed that I was male. I wasn't intentionally trying to hide anything so when I was asked directly, I let them know. One of my closest friends of over a year, who I chatted with on a daily bases, did not take it well. I'm unsure if it was because he felt I was hiding it from him or if it was something else but he flat out refused to talk to me again <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>That's simultaneously silly and sad. I can see if you two were about to be married and you suddenly told him your gender wasn't what he thought it was, but there's no sense in alienating someone like that when it's a casual gaming relationship.</p><p>Usually when people in other games found out I was female it was in voice chat, or an occasional "leave me alone, I'm on the rag" comment in text chat, but I never lost any friendships over it. I'm sorry to hear it did happen to you.</p>

                <p>FPS games are rampant with what some might consider to be misogynism. I was a senior admin at a very busy site (at the time) for many years, and I played several games at all levels for even more. During official games, it's usually frowned upon to say anything more than is necessary to keep the game rolling, but during "friendlies" (heh), mixes and public games, it's generally not only accepted but expected that your opponents will do and say everything they can to distract you. If being called a filthy whore and being told your baby sister is going to get raped by a dog makes you rage, you can guarantee it won't be the last time it'll be said. I don't condone or excuse it, quite the opposite, but that's how it is. It's not misogynism, it's banter taken too far.</p><p>The interesting thing (for me, at least) is that, from the many complaints of this I dealt with over the years as an admin, the vast majority were from males trying to do the whole protective man thing. The "victims"? They rarely complained themselves, they merely gave back as good as they got. Or, just like the males, they started the whole slanging matches in the first place.</p><p>Now, I'm not saying it never happens. It does and it can get nasty. Some people are just total bastards, not really much you can do about that except moderate the games as much as possible. What I am saying is that there are a lot "look at me I'm caring" posts in this thread written by clearly ignorant people trying to blow things out of proportion. In my experience (and I actually HAVE some), the problem is absolutely nowhere near as big as what some people are making it out to be.</p><p>As for the whole "women being portrayed as sexual objects" thing, do I really need to point out that not every man has 50" biceps and is an expert in martial arts and weapons? According to many games, they're either this or obese and bald. I'm neither of these but I realise games with these characters are unrealistic for a reason, so I won't be going on a march about it. If so many women really hated these games, there wouldn't be so many buying them. Money speaks in this industry more than anything else.</p>

                <p>I disagree with Rulesy on every point.</p><p>It is exactly the same here in Australia with Aussie Rules Football.

They will try and find what can touch the most.</p><p>For years, racist taunts have been used until it was officially banned and recognised for what it is: racism.</p><p>There are still some in the community who try to argue that it's just some old fashion banter, calling a player a filthy ape because he's black.</p><p>Well, sorry but no. It's racism.</p><p>That women hardly reported it is not a sign that it did not offend them. It would be rather logical that many were offended and gave up, or started playing as male characters right away.</p><p>Two more points: I see Rulesy is raising the point of the man in shining armour - this was covered earlier on in this thread and it's interesting that those who try to justify and excuse sexism would have us believe that it's mostly about men trying to be knights in shining armours.<br>Same thing goes for the sexual objectification thing - saying that it's the same thing when men are portrayed with huge muscles, it's been covered in depth earlier on in this thread and it's really just a cop out from someone trying to ignore or justify sexism.</p><p>We live in deeply sexist societies and most of us have grown up with a sexist education so much so that we don't see it or choose to ignore it in a way that would not be accepted if it was racism.</p><p>It takes a bit of an effort, possibly some reading and an open mind to understand this.</p>

It's not misogynism, it's banter taken too far.</cite></p><p>And the bit I've highlighted answers the question. It's because "that's how it is" has been the explanation for long enough that it's now a self-fulfilling prophecy. And that comes down to the people running the game. Because, actually, no game has an "anything goes" policy. If my "banter" involved posting up people's personal details I'd get stomped on pretty damn quickly. It's because at worst this is tolerated and at best the potential penalties for it aren't harsh enough to put people off.</p><p>I think you seriously want to consider the ramifications of this argument. Because if we're to accept that FPS players are just like this, surely that means that any other gaming community is justified in reacting to them with suspicion and even hostility? Because if "it's just like that", how can we be confident they won't pollute other games with the same behaviour?</p><p><cite>The interesting thing (for me, at least) is that, from the many complaints of this I dealt with over the years as an admin, the vast majority were from males trying to do the whole protective man thing. </cite></p><p>Workshop has already covered the strong possibility that a significant number of women simply stopped playing or chose male avatars.

Is that unreasonable of me?</p><p><cite>What I am saying is that there are a lot "look at me I'm caring" posts in this thread written by clearly ignorant people trying to blow things out of proportion. In my experience (and I actually HAVE some), the problem is absolutely nowhere near as big as what some people are making it out to be.</cite></p><p>But if people hadn't posted, then the argument would be that this isn't something that bothers many people and hence its being blown out of proportion. So, either way, it ends up with an argument for not doing anything. A cynic might suggest that's the point.</p><p><cite>As for the whole "women being portrayed as sexual objects" thing, do I really need to point out that not every man has 50" biceps and is an expert in martial arts and weapons? According to many games, they're either this or obese and bald.</cite></p><p>There's a way wider range of male body types in popular media.

                <p>I agree with Axiin about female gamers vs females who play games. There's a farming game I play (shut up, I don't want to hear it) and it's the only farming game I've ever played and liked. I'd much rather play a bloody horror or GTA-ish type of game where I can randomly beat people up, but for some reason I like this particular farming game. Almost all of the comments I see about the game, and almost all of the user profiles I see, are from/of females. When I pvp in a different game, almost all of the other players are male.</p><p>Yes there are a lot of females who play games, but I'm reasonably sure most are playing "casual" games such as match 3 or hidden objects. While some definitely do spend money on the games they play, I'm pretty sure most of that money isn't going toward online FPS games or even MMOs.</p>

                <p>I love that this topic is totally booming thanx to me XD</p><p>Also I would like to add that attacking someone for saying the exact same thing as a few pages earlier is not really necessary considering there are 33 pages, so there's a big chance that will happen.</p><p>Also.. <em>random fact: communication is 80% non-verbal so always <strong>consider</strong> the fact that you misinterpret the other person.</em></p><p><cite> Regardless of your personal definition, you can't deny there are enough females to make a change if they wanted one. </cite></p><p>Well, first of all, that is a really short sided conclusion to make. To me the number surprises me. I consider myself a women gamer, but I didn't know there are that many woman gamers. Of all the people I meet ingame 1/10 are female. The other people are clearly male or unknown. There is a high possibility that the females are hiding, but that also means hiding from each other. You can't really help each other if you can't spot each other.</p><p><cite>I'm making a stink about it because the culture is cancerous, because wonderful women like my wife are disgusted at how their gender is portrayed and objectified. I wish she could participate in the games that I played and not feel insulted, but currently... she cant.</cite></p><p>Thank god I'm not insulted by games, but I can image that lots of people would be. I am blessed with the fact that I like the way the general ingame female looks, but if you don't then you don't have a lot of options. None playable characters are usually slutty, helpless or ugly evil bitches. I cannot say that it really bothers me, but I cannot deny that I'm not 'concerned'. There are countless researching saying media has a large influence on the self-esteem of young girls about there body, there are also other other results saying violence in games affect people in their violent behavior. Who is to say the females portrayed in the games don't encourage sexism? (note: this is just an educated guess)</p><p>Personally I think there are a lot of other forms of sexism besides the verbal abuse towards women. The knight in shining armor is definitely the form I most encounter and never know how to respond to it.<br>The lines here are so thin, I can't even make out when it's sexism or not. But when males take offense when I say I don't want them to protect me, I feel really uncomfortable and usually see them turning against me and siding with the males who are already openly sexists. This leaves me the other option to not say anything and let the 'knight' do his thing and leave me uncomfortable as well. This makes me feel I am weak and need to be protected, which is total bull cus I perfectly can take on those digital zombies on my own. This type of sexism is not just present in games, but all over the world and, to be frank, more in the US than europe (my experience, I am Dutch, so to make that statement more personal: More in the english speaking countries than in the Netherlands)</p>

Rarely do I see male NPCs with little armour on and a bulging crotch, but maybe I'm just playing the wrong games.

I can't remember the last time I encountered this, but perhaps it's because I've been gaming with, for the most part, the same 40 or 50 males for anywhere between 2 and 6 years. I think after that much time gaming together, people act more as friends thus getting rid of a lot of the in-game sexism (aside from the friendly banter that goes on).</p>

                <p>Oh jeezes, I love these kinds of debates, but first I have to trudge through 30+ pages of discussion. For now, I just think I'll say that I don't think any video game is dominated by misogyny. Just the vocal minority effect. Well, for now, I'll saddle up my horse, don my cloak, and delve into this dark dungeon of discussion. Note: In the mildly likely chance that I actually start commenting on this thread in earnest, not all opinions and arguments advanced by me are actually my opinions. I'm both a gadfly and the devil's advocate.</p>

Started studying psychology and the first thing you learn is to read critically. Check facts, check sources, check the research behind the research. No source? no good.</p><p>Back on topic. It's been a while.</p><p>I think, as with a lot of things including racism, homophobia etc, there is a lot of invisible discrimination that no one sees unless that plate in front of their faces is smashed.</p><p>I give a small example. I always was convinced I was totally pro-homo. And even though I always spoke my mind about how it was OK to be gay and always defend the people getting attacked for their sexuality. But, now that I look back, I also did and felt think about this subject that were conflicting with what I believed. I still use the word 'gay' to indicated something is stupid or lame. After some soul searching I realised I do see homosexuals as a flaw of nature. But more in a way that it is a genetic mutation, as is someone born with 6 fingers or one who has a genetic disposition of developing breast cancer. I feel this way because biologically speaking homosexuality does not make sense to me. <em>I am not saying it is <strong>wrong</strong> in any way!</em> In the end a relationship is not about sex or procreating, but about love. Maybe this is mother nature telling us we need LESS '16 and pregnant' and MORE 'adopt-a-african-child-who-needs-your-love-and-protection'.</p><p>My point is: I was a person stating to be pro-homo, but I probably offended a lot of people. Homosexuals, african-americans, women need to be respected. They do NOT need to be saved in a way that they are helpless. Giving them special treatment and 'kudoz' for surviving this hard world is just as discriminating, because it suggest they need all these 'selfless' people to protect them.</p><p>To put this a bit in perspective since I strayed a bit from the actual topic. I feel women are generally respected. Racism and homophobia still have a long way to go.<br>But as you can see on google (that was funny though thanx XD) and in games, the 'battle for women' is not over. And I'm not a feminist, haha. But I've been called one frequently whenever I said that someone was disrespectful to me based on my gender. Pff how many guys(friends) have been 'insulted' when I really didn't want them to take me home 'safely'.</p><br><br><p>Also I wrote the above before egin replied. so this one is just for him:<br>I don't know where you get your knowledge from, but I'd like to hear some of you must-be-amazing sources.</p><p>1. Since I study psychology, I learned that women in general were never included in researches and studies as subjects before (educated guess) 1950. And in a lot of other domains women have not been included. Lil example; Recently there is a lot of attention on the research of women with heart conditions. Why? Because the researches in the past never included women, so a lot of the treatments developed for heart disease were developed FOR MEN. Since women PHYSICALLY are different, the treatments were a lot less effective for them. So yes men and women are different, but not the way you say.</p><p>2. Women have never been given the chance to rised and develop their talents. Women weren't allowed to have education until 1900 or so. It's no surprise we have not much female role-models to look up to, because those have never been given an inch of spotlight.</p><p>Also some general differences: <br>- Women nurture, men don't. Humanity wouldn't survive without women besides the fact we need them to procreate.<br>- Women look after the group, men look after themselfs. This is just an elaboration of the pervious difference, but it is also the reason woman are less eager to take the spotlight. Men need to prove themselfs more, woman don't. (Biologically speaking logical. Men need to divide themselfs from the rest so the woman picks him)<br>- Women are better at resolving conflict. Women tend to be more agreeable. Men always want to be right and 'prove' themselfs.<br>- Women are emotionally intelligent. Women are more in touch with their feelings / emotional sides.</p><p>I'm gonna stop here. because I am not trying to make all men feel incompetent <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> jk, men and women need each other, one is not better than the other.</p>

                <p>Well, IQ is actually measure by your problem solving skills and cognitive capability.<br>to be exact, it originated from this formula:</p><p>mental age/physical age x 100 = IQ</p><p>The reason IQ is used for so many studies as a usefull instrument for measuring intelligence is because it has proven to be a rather reliable tool time and time again.</p><p>Also since (see formula) IQ is actually a percentage in its way, in every test your IQ might vary, because they have defined it slightly differently. generally your IQ stays the same over time (formula was initially used for children)</p><p>Intelligence on the other hand is something you can develop and gain by engaging in stimulating and challenging tasks like reading books.</p><p>You might find IQ not a reliable mean to describe intelligence, but it has been proven the best there is atm.</p>

It is proven those are connected.</p><p>Also, personal experience/knowledge is important for sure! But you can't make statements about the world or other people based on that. Whatever experience you had with education, that applies to YOU, not others.</p><p>Academic knowledge is obtained by research and studies. Just because you can't be 100% sure of something, doesn't mean you should discard it as being wrong. Also academic studies are based on empirical evidence, which means evidence that can be observed.</p><p>I cannot tell you how underdeveloped people were if we only had our personal experience to guide us.</p>

Because we were uninformed about the concequences or choose to ignore the information presented. <br>Why were we uninformed? Because no reseach has been done about these consequenses and there was simply no knowledge about them.<br>How do we solve our world going to shit?

I for one live in the Netherlands (I know more are on twinoid) and I am sometimes speechless at the blunt discriminating comment I see from (I guess most of the time) Americans.

I'd give you the reference, but I don't think you could find the information on the internet. Also I gave the vague 'numbers' to someone not giving any 'numbers' at all and I didn't feel the need to give a very elaborate argumentation to someone I was not convinced would even read it (properly).</p><p>Also, I am not saying anyone is superior, I was simply giving a few argument as to why the statement "Men are better at anything" is flawed (by someone who <strong>actually</strong> believes men are superior)</p><p>I am slightly disappointed that my 'view' has been interpreted for me since I do not believe in the superiority of any gender, neither am I stating that those statistics actual prove a believe like that. So I wonder what your ground is to make that assumption.</p><p>Let me qoute myself:<br><strong>"men and women need each other, one is not better than the other."</strong></p>

Say: 51% of women are have a higher EQ than 49% of men. Women have an average of 100 EQ where men have 99 EQ.

                <p>Hehehe. They actually tried to cite The Onion as controversial. The bloody Onion? The same "paper" that put out an article about how NASA executed God on the Moon? Ahaha, Red Eye, really? Red Eye has always been a terrible affront to human consciousness. Heh, Huffington Post. Still they're still pretending they're a legitimate news source. A lot of that was just advertising though, and while I despise the use of sexuality to sell stuff that isn't related to sexuality, I could recognize its utility. Many, many of those things lacked context. In fact, that "montage" doesn't really bring much to the table at all, because without context, we can't really make judgments on most of those things. ...I still can't believe they went after the Onion.</p>

                <p>The Onion's entire point was that the idea was ridiculous. I'm not sure how the video's creators failed to realize this.</p><p>Not really related to the video: Do women find it offensive to have a female character portrayed in a negative light in a movie? I'm trying to figure out where the line is crossed between a "flawed character" and an "attack on all women".</p><p>Back to the video: I'm also not sure how the Joan Rivers clip applies to women in the media. Is the media failing women by broadcasting her ridiculous racist comments? Is Joan Rivers failing women by being racist? Neither of these two fail women (in general) in any way - the whole thing is an example of Joan Rivers failing <em>herself</em>.</p>

There are a lot of flawed characters that are portrayed as weak, spineless human beings. Think for example peter pettigrew from harry potter, I think a woman could have played the role just as good, without is becoming an attack on women. But whenever a character is weak simply because they are a woman, like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman (not necessarily a negative role, but she is helpless and can only be saved by a man apparently), that is where I draw the line.</p><p>I must note: whenever you draw lines, be prepared to bend them, since no two situations are the same.</p>

                <p>Just chipping in a little interesting idea, not sure if it was mentioned before (300+ posts is a bit tiresome to trawl through one by one). The idea is that gaming becoming misogynistic and male-dominated happened by circumstance and semi-accident, in a way. Marketing departments for games were trying to increase sales when games declined in the 80's for a bit, so of course they looked to the leading demographic, which at the time was males. This lead to games being marketed to males more, and this in turn lead to a wave of games in the 90's and 00's being very URGH MANLY MEN DOING MANLY THINGS OH YEEEEAH, so to speak. Of course, by this point in time, it had become very noticeable and many protested, but to the credit of those marketing departments, they did get LODSOFEMONE, meaning the industry at large was rather set in it's ways. So it could be argued that the idea of gaming being male dominated, sexist, misogynistic, whatever term you employ, was inserted by people who saw it in gender terms, whereas the marketers and designers saw it in terms of following the biggest trail of money/sales. Now, whether it was ok to pitch games to and make games specifically for one gender and ignore the other (I don't think Duke Nukem 3D was ever really pitched for ladies, for example), that's entirely up to the individual's discretion, but if it's true, it's absolutely fascinating to see the insertion of issues into what is, essentially, people aiming for optimal results at a specific point in time, and how much debate it can spark. Very interesting to see the unintended impact a decision like that can have so many years afterwards. Of course, this doesn't apply to all 'macho' games, and there were many games released that have been aimed for no particular gender or for females, but still, it's cool to think about. Of course, you might just think this theory is utter crap, but that's fine, up to the discretion of the individual, as per any idea. Besides, it's not my idea, so you can ridicule the crap out of it and i won't mind <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>
