                <p><em>In a city full of crime, a small group of people have come together to catch all the criminals of the place. They must catch, interrogate, and prosecute each individual outlaw and put them in jail. It is an ongoing battle of wit, and it begins here.</em></p><p><strong>Due Law Process</strong> is a game where there are two opposing sides: Criminals and Police. The Police try to find and catch the Criminals, and then prosecute and imprison them. There are 3 phases in this:<br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/dead.png" alt=":mush_dead:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Interrogation and Locating</strong><br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/triumph.png" alt=":mush_triumph:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Finding and Neutralizing</strong><br><img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/status/mastered.png" alt=":mush_mastered:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>Prosecuting and Imprisoning</strong></p><p>These jobs are done by:<br><strong>-Interrogation Officers<br>-Combat Police<br>-Lawyers</strong></p><p>The Police must succeed in all 3 phases to win, while the Criminals only have to succeed in one to prevail.</p><p><strong>Carreers</strong><br>When you create your character, you must choose a job that you will do. The Police jobs are shown above, but these are the criminal ones:</p><p><strong>The Gangster</strong> That combats the Police in the Finding and Neutralizing Phase.<br><strong>The Evil Lawyer</strong> That combats the Good Lawyers in the Prosecuting and Imprisoning Phase.<br>-There are no criminals for the 1st phase, as no one wants to be someone who was caught and is being questioned.</p><p><strong>Character Creation</strong><br>Name:<br>Age:<br>Alignment: (Police or Criminal)<br>Career: (Interrogation Officer, Combat Police, Gangster, or Good and Bad Lawyer.)<br>Description:<br>Backround:<br>Other Info:</p><p>There has to be players of every career for the game to start, so at first there will be one person per job, so first come first serve. After all 5 are filled up, i'll allow multiple people for a job. The exception is Combat Police and Gangsters, which there can be up to 3 on each side.</p><p><strong>Gameplay + Phases</strong><br><strong><em>Interrogating and Locating</em></strong><br>This phase is when the Interrogation Officer questions the caught criminal of the whereabouts of the Gangsters. They must decide which zone the gangsters are in.<br><strong>North Side</strong><br><em>The Coffee Shop</em><br><em>The Supermarket</em><br><em>The Grocery Store</em><br><em>The Museum</em><br><strong>East Side</strong><br><em>The Docks</em><br><em>The Warehouse</em><br><em>The Ship</em><br><em>The Construction Site</em><br><strong>South Side</strong><br><em>The Shoe Store</em><br><em>The Flower Shop</em><br><em>The Grand Tower</em><br><em>The Complex</em><br><strong>West Side</strong><br><em>The Military Base</em><br><em>The Car Company</em><br><em>The CellPhone Shop</em><br><em>The Town Hall</em></p><p>The Interrogation Officers have 3 days to find out where the gangsters are.<br>On Day 1 They Must Find which 2 Quadrants they may be in.<br>On Day 2 They Must Find which Quadrant they are in.<br>On Day 3 They Must Find the exact zone the gangsters are in.</p><p>Here is how interrogation works.<br>1- The criminal starts off with a set amount of <strong>willpower.</strong><br>2- The Interrogation Officer roleplays questioning and rolls a d20 and a d6.<br>3- The higher the role of the d20, the more likely the criminal's willpower will be damaged.<br>4- In a private chat with only me, I will roll a d20 of the criminal.<br>5- If the IO's roll is higher or equal to the criminal's, then his willpower is damaged by the amount of the d6.<br>6- This happens five times each day, and if the willpower goes below 0, then the criminal cracks and the day's objective is complete. Otherwise, the criminal stands and the Criminal Team wins.<br>7- If the Police win each day, then they learn the location of the Gangsters and proceed to Phase 2.</p><p><strong><em>Finding and Neutralizing</em></strong><br>This is where the Combat Police go and capture the criminals, and bring them to court.<br>This is where all the shooting and chasing comes in, and where the Criminals will get away or get captured.<br>1- Each turn, every player can do one of these actions.<br><em>Shoot, Hide, Search, Hide Body, or Capture</em><br><strong>Shooting-</strong> Every player starts with 20 HP. If they drop to 0, then they pass out and can be Captured. To shoot, choose a target (A player) and roll a d20. Then the defender will do the same. If your role is higher than the defenders, then you deal d10 damage to them. Otherwise, no damage is dealt.<br><strong>Hiding</strong>- Find a hiding spot, so you can't get shot. First, roll a d20. On a 12 or higher, you find a spot to camp in and can't be affected or do any actions yourself. If a Gangster stays hiden for 3 turns, they win the game.<br><strong>Searching</strong>- Search for a hidden player, to find them. To do this, roll a d20. On a 12 or higher, you find them. If you find a hidden player, you may do a <em>shoot</em> action on them. Otherwise, your turn passes.<br><strong>Capture</strong>- Take a fallen body into custody. This is a free action if no Gangsters are currently active. To do this, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher, they are taken in. Otherwise, an active Gangster can do a <em>shoot</em> action on you.<br><strong>Hide Body</strong>- Hide a fellow Gangster's body, so they can wake up and get away. You can only do this on a knocked out Gangster. Before this action takes place, a Combat Police gets to make a shoot action on you. If they miss, then you roll a d20. On a 18 or higher, you win the phase and the game, because you hid a Gangster's body and he will wake up and bust you out of court.</p><p>Police win this phase when they have Captured all Gangster's bodies. Gangsters win when they kill all Combat Police, or when they hide for three turns, or when they successfully hide a body. If Police win, proceed to Phase 3.</p><p><strong><em>Prosecuting and Imprisoning</em></strong><br>This is where the Lawyers battle in court to convince the Jury to find the Gangster guilty. The rules of this are based off of the way I did it in an old roleplay.</p><p>1- First, the Good Lawyers roll a d20 to convince and a d6 to persuade. The Judge's persuasive points start at 0.<br>2- If the d20 roll is 11 or higher, then the judge's persuasive points go up or down by the roll of the d6.<br>3- Good Lawyers make the points go up, Evil Ones bring it down.<br>4- The Police win when they make the Judge's persuasive points 10, and Criminals win at -10.</p><p>If the Police win Phase 3, then against all odds they have won the game!<br>Otherwise, the Criminals win!</p><p>So I just had some free time and thought this up. I could use some feedback or player entries to get things started. Yes, it's a lot to read, but I think it may be worth it.</p>

                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Pail Bergrun<br><strong>Age:</strong> 58<br><strong>Alignment:</strong> Criminal<br><strong>Career:</strong> Bad Lawyer<br><strong>Description:</strong> His old age depreciated his visage. With his sunken eyes, sagging skin, and completely white (Yes, white not gray), he gives of an aura of a grim reaper in a suit.<br><strong>Backround:</strong> An unpleasant and unlucky man who took decades, sacrificing his social life, to become a lawyer where he spent decades being abused and ridiculed for always being at the bottom. His boss made a huge failure and put all the blame on him as an escape goat, enraged him and he went into a drinking fit at a bar. There begun all the story about his life in the underground, and how he was able to become successful, even if it's just as someone's else puppet.<br><strong>Other Info:</strong> His success only comes from his connections and other side of work, therefor don't expect too much from him in a real mano-e-mano confrontation of wits. Having no experience with women, yet being a mafioso, he gets nervous around them and his brain starts to malfunction, quadrupling his success rate!... the other way around that is.</p>
