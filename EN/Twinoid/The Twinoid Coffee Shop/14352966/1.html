You can tell that by everyone has been going, "Oh I'm a 90s kid! I remember when there was cassettes!".</p><p>Oh, by the way, I have an entire drawer full off cassettes in my night stand.</p>

                <p>...What? Of course the rewards should differ. I didn't complain against that. That's obvious. And what do you mean by the last bit? If you do it randomly, I presume you mean completely random, like pulling a card out of a hat. And people level up. The only reason I'll do them is for the skill tomes. If I have a choice between Librarian and Mission, I'd choose librarian.</p>

                <p>Every occupation can craft their items by collecting shit on different places.For spell tomes you need to make paper out of river bamboo,and you need to energise on different spots to gather elemental energies.<br>So,blacksmiths can make armor,but that armor is only for SELLING,and it gets a name with SELF MADE e.g. Self-made Iron Armor.That way you can remember which of your things are for use,and which are for sell.It's the same for others.Meat that hunters catch is for selling only,books that libarians make,basic wares that merchants find,potions that Alchemists brew etc etc...</p>

                <p>KOW STFU FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!! STOP SPAMMING THIS THREAD!!!</p><p>1. No,you don't need an entire turn to eat of drink.First read the whole thread then talk nonsense like that!<br>2.No,you cannot access the river from the village side,because only the east side has copper in it.<br>3. Making armor is not useless because merchants can set their own prices,there is no WORTH for anything.<br>4. Only merchants can sell metal once they get it.<br>5. I may alter the map but river is so valuable,and that's why it's so hard to get to.Besides,you only need 3 turns if you start from the village.</p><p>Conclusion: Kow,whenever you write in this thread,it becomes a mess.Read the game help and the entire thread and then talk. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/evil.png" alt=":bad:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Thegame, as i stated before, mages have robes of their color,so you have a red robe and fabric boots.And,also as i stated before,all of the new players start in Strifinham. ALSO,as i stated before,your starter item is connected to your class,not your occupation.Therefore you start with a a Fire Rod.

                <p>Okay, guys! It's been enough slacking for old MJ! Did i miss ya? Let's begin this again.<br>Also, I've got something to say. Beside school and other stuff i got to do, i also didn't feel like managing this thread, for one reason. You guys make it 0% easier for me. I have a few things to ask from you guys before we begin</p><p>- Can you please, PLEASE update your overview? When you get the battle report, go to your Notepad file where you saved it and tweak the HP and the XP. It would mean a world to me, because it makes my job multiple times easier. Don't just copy-paste your old overview, it doesn't work like that.</p><p>- I have a Birthday Table game left over from August 2012. and i want to finish it to make room for the next event i'll be posting on my birthday this year. So please remember to include your guess to your move, because there are some sweet prizes in there, and i really hope some of you will get them. If the table is not finished by 23rd of August, i'll just remove it form the game, so keep guessing, or you'll lose your chance. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>- When you post a move, you can do another 24 hours of MY report, not 24 hours of your post. So when i do your move it starts the clock.</p><p>- Before doing any of your guys' past moves, I'll do mine first, just to show you how a player overview should look like. I'm begging you, add every statistic to your table if you haven't already, it makes it a lot easier for me to keep track of your progress and work on your move. Also, if your statistic is improved by an item, don't just add that number to your base statistic, do it like this: <em>ATK: 2 + 1</em> That is really helpful to me because, for an example, I'm a ranger, and my base attack is 0 if i don't have any arrows, which i don't at the moment. But, i bought a sword, which would usually add up to my attack, but in case of no arrows, it works as a weapon of it's own, making my attack 4. That's why i need that information too.</p><p>I hope you follow these requests, as it would make this game a lot faster, smoother and easier for me and other players to play. Please, i don't want my experience ruined, because i really enjoy managing this game, so if you post a turn with bad overview and/or not update it, i'll ignore the turn until you fix it. Now, let's get the basics out of the way and start playing again!</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/7292/worldmapg.png">Map of Strifinham Valley</a><br><a

And for you two, I've got a minor fever so i won't be able to post on here. And, Thegamefan, I specified THIS A LONG TIME AGO: <em>MY REPORT STARTS THE TIMER.</em> I know guys, a bold introduction blasted into pieces, but i promise I'll do your moves when i get better, hopefully on Monday. See you all 'til then!</p>

                <p>Sorry guys, but tomorrow are the final exams that i must get an A on, so no time for this.<br>I will, however, answer your questions real quick, Mad.</p><p>- All you need is materials to craft as a blacksmith. Of course, you have to BE a Blacksmith, as no other occupation can do such a thing.</p><p>- No, getting a pickaxe and specifying that you'll use it in a search turn only increases your chances of finding ore. You can find it anyway, but it's more common at <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_default.gif" alt=":drpg_map_default:" class="tid_ico"> Coppermud River, <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_mountain.gif" alt=":drpg_map_mountain:" class="tid_ico"> Mountain of Trolls, <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_default.gif" alt=":drpg_map_default:" class="tid_ico"> Glacier Ruins and <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_fj.gif" alt=":drpg_map_fj:" class="tid_ico"> Ancient Temple than on the other places.</p><p>- Yes, you must go to town to smelt things, and it costs no money, but if you give some other Blacksmith to do it, it's his choice will he ask money for it or not (or will he even do it).</p><p>- Yes, you can build your shop, and it's the only way to actually sell your products. Every other way is considered peddling and is treated as a crime. So, if we get someone with a Guard occupation, you're gonna have a bad time. Also, you need certain building materials to make your shop, or any other shop. If you are interested, i can give you a complete list.</p>

                <p>TheGameFan, barely 12 hours passed since i did you move. You have to wait just that long one more time to get your turn.<br>And Genvoski, It doesn't really have any counter. It's just purely random. But it's basically the same thing, so i'll do the search.</p><p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Genvoski walks along the shore, hoping to find something in the water. At that very moment, he notices a wooden crate floating down the stream. He manages to swim over to it and drag it out to the shore. It had a stamp on it. Apparently, it comes from a distant land,. Probably someone dropped it from the deck of a boat. With some effort, he managed to open it, only to find that it was a food parcel, full of mush and rotten bits of junk. Even though this find was a failure, he tried to make most of it by tearing the good pieces of the crate apart.<br><br>1 ITEM OBTAINED:<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_refine.gif" alt=":hordes_atelier:" class="tid_ico"> Sunleaf Tree Plank</span></span></p><p>Also, everyone, look at MadDonut's overview. That is what i call an overview. So yeah, if everyone could put some more effort into making their overviews, that'd be great.</p>

You have class and occupation info on the first page, but you should know some things:</p><p>All classes start with Tunic and Fabric Boots, except for mages, who start with robes of their respected color (Blue, Red, Yellow).</p><p>On level 1 you get 1 of every stat, but if you are a scout or a ranger you get 2 AGL but 0 DEF, if you are a shieldman you get 2 DEF but 0 ATK and if you are a Soldier you get 1 ATK and 0 AGL. If you are a healer you get 1 ATK 1 DEF 0 AGL, but an ability to heal outside of battle faster than the others. Mages have 1 of every stat, they are balanced.</p><p>Use icons if you can, it looks better and it is more functional to me as i can check your stats more easily.</p><p>Write down your mission at the end of your Overview, then i can remember what mission it was and keep track of your progress.</p><p>Save your overview in a Notepad file and when i give you a report, just open the file, tweak the Gold, HP, XP and the other things, and save. To make it a bunch easier for you, make your overview here, with all the icons, then simply copy the icon codes, too. So when you paste it back in the next day, the icons will automatically appear.

                <p>Ohkay, ohkay, guys. Hold on. First of all, TheIncredible, you don't have a Leather shield, you have a wooden club, you are a healer. You bought a studded shield and got damage because... Well... I dunno, shit happens. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>MrCreeper, can you please go through all 60 pages of this thread and name me one in which i mentioned a shop for mages, or, while we're at it, a Ring of Attack? I have no clue whatsoever where did you get that one from,as there are currently no rings in this game, and you cannot build a shop for mage stuff specifically. The shop you use to sell staffs and the rest is called a Merchant's Store, so please, i know this thread has become confusing due to the fact that all of the rules are not in one place, and i'm working on it, but please, don't make stuff up, it just makes it even worse for everyone to understand.</p><p>Otacon, no, you won't go into negatives. You just simply have 0% chance to avoid the attack, and that's all there is to it. This also goes for TheIncredible. You don't have -1 Agility, you have 0.</p>

                <p>Well, I'll be honest with you. This game works on a principle: "I feel like it", which means that when i say "random", i actually mean "The first thing that pops in my mind". I plan on implementing the randomness system in the game, so it becomes more fair if you don't trust me as a manager. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And, to answer your question. You won't really get any benefit form the idol whatsoever. Actually, you should consider it a burden, because it takes up a slot in your inventory, but does absolutely nothing. But don't worry. Collecting all of those idols will be worthwhile, because the Crystal Isle is a great place, lots of new monsters, quests, and a brand new Crystal tier armor and weapons. So be patient, and keep searchin' for them idols. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I think not, Marky. You see, i am the only one to fully understand every concept of the game, and i will never be unfair towards anyone, because none of the people who play this game know me personally, so for instance i won't give better items to one person and worse to other. But other people might do this, understand?</p><p>Plus, i am a half-control freak. I have a constant feeling that things will go wrong when i'm not supervising, because of the exact same reason- i have the best grasp of what to actually do as a manager. I could explain the whole thing to someone and let him be the manager, but don't forget that i'm the one who thought of the whole game, so nobody could do it better than i do it. Also, if the admins also play, some of them might give himself unfair advantages. And we don't want that, do we? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Hi guys, sorry this thing isn't as lively as it was, like, some time ago. This thread is actually really huge now, and I really like this idea of mine, but the problem with keeping it going is that I have all the necessary data about the game plus the entire thing thought out in my head, so it'd be difficult to give it to someone else on, well, managing, to put it that way. I'm the only person who CAN do it, but I feel no motivation to do it.<br>I've managed this thread before because I was younger and I got hyped up because there was a slight chance that this becomes an official Twinoid game which would be awesome, but... Well... That possibility's long gone, I guess. I've never gotten word about it since then and... I just lost all hope about it. I hope you guys understand what I'm saying here. I'll see if maybe in the future I get more motivation to manage this little RPG, but for now... Enjoy what games you've got on the forum, i guess.</p><br><p>I just hope you all kept your character sheets somewhere in your computer.</p>

                <p>Oh. Well that clever, I guess. Still, I prefer having my own randomness factor instead of letting everything be decided by RP Gadgets. You see, when I decide Criticals and other things like that in this game, I use a peculiar randomness factor that's hard to explain, but works perfectly. The only thing that this game lacks is a constant preview of rules. Every time a new thing is added, I have to post it as the latest post and it gets buried within the actual game content. Newcomers are never quite sure of what to do if they want to join, because the first page doesn't explain everything, plus there have been a lot of changes over the course of time. So that makes it even more confusing o everyone, which is one of the reasons I don't feel like managing this thread. Every turn there's a ton of error corrections, double-checks and typos, and it makes it confusing even for me, the guy who actually came up with the thing. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico"></p>
