WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!? Now the syntax is screwed up...<br>The king of the bagel of death requests donut sacrifices! And the donuts sacrificed themselves for grammar reformation, but the bagel king said angrily: "Enough! there's too much sugar in the world. DESTROY ALL DESSERTS!!" But the donuts don't want to destroy all the desserts. So they raped them all instead of eating them. Which caused the king joining them in a brutal fast food competition at McDonalds drivethrough. Even so, the fat employee ate Everyone.The end.or is it?!?!? Thanks Captain Obviousn THE GREATEST HERO OF ALL TIME! Actually it's the end. Seriously. Shush. AND THE BEGINNING of an era becomes the downfall and the Titanfall and the Winterfall and the waterfall and the catfall of spies andof spice and beat drops. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!<br>Moving on to the next level, using a cheatcode that ended up recalibrating the entire code of the game's graphics, I Facepalm at death so the Grim raped my eyes and ears and my unicorn, but the unicorn counter-raped,with its horn OF PAINFUL RAPE!!! After that I kissed an ass, it tasted like butt chocolate, which tasted pretty good and smelled sexy.<br>Too graphic guys, they won't be liking Butt Chocolate(Trademark).<br>Okay, the thread Is Going Downhill on opposite day, maybe. Not really Miner revived it Sacrificing the RNG and his porn to no avail... To ALL avail. Maybe now this will stay alive and make sense to stupid readers.<br>Now let's talk, Dick Richard Phallic.<br>Please talk now! You can't make pie out of Grandma's old sock! or can you?<br>DUN DUN DUN!!!<br>Half Life3 confirmed.<br>In your dreams,<br>You'll never make<br>Death Walks Alone, Which is un-related, to the fact that everyone dies when they smell like Oranges sexting his ex banana like a man.<br>In other news the giant man eating lemon is rotting against his will so I will do jack shit about the person who randomly joins in with a oversized purple underwear of Hippos, Otherwise that revives the dead from deserted threads<br>Meanwhile everyone else exploded into lemons and then cried, or did they? Harry Potter drank some purple liquid. Which revives the carnivorous testicle clamps that were seen last fuckin' tuesday in the gymnasium sweat like froogs rebuilding bureaucracy chairman Mao, the android. The Almighty Pastry scowled in disbelief. "What a necro!" he screamed, angered. "Makes no sense!" But madness was <strong>absolutely unstoppable. Everyone</strong></p>
