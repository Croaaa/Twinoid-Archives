                <p>I'm a Zombie genre fan.</p><p>I play Die2Nite on Twinoid, and am a fan of almost all things Zombie.</p><p>I have a sticker on my car that reads. "WARNING: I speed up to run over Zombies!"</p><p>With that said, I am a big fan of the movie ZombieLand starring Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Woody Harrelson.</p><p>Recently, Amazon Instant Video produced a pilot episode of ZombieLand for their new TV service to compete with NetFlix and Hulu Plus, among others in the digital content, original programming provider game.</p><br><br><p>ZombieLand THE MOVIE, was a breakout film in a genre stuffed with "realistic zombie horror" because it took said genre and put tongue firmly in cheek.</p><p>It was perfectly cast, with Harrison as 'Tallahassee', Watson as 'Witchita' and Eisenberg as 'Columbus'.</p><p>It was funny, well acted and refreshing. The audience felt each characters quirks as it was expertly narrated by Eisenberg of 'The Social Network' fame, and each actor expertly nailed their parts.</p><br><p>The Amazon created TV show is a far far PALE comparison of the beloved movie.</p><p>Most heinously, and for starters, it is COMPLETELY mis-cast.</p><br><p>I won't even bother to look up the names of the actors tasked with filling such big shoes...just know that they ALL are the wrong choice.</p><p>The actor tasked with playing our favorite Zombie killer, Tallahassee, as made famous by Harrelson, would actually be pretty close....if he just shaved his head.</p><p>The Tallahassee in this ill-gotten pilot definitely has the EYES, facial features and zest of Harrelson....but the hair on his head un-do's EVERYTHING else.</p><p>Also, the new actor's lack of a southern drawl, cowboy hat, and general 'Don't give a shit' attitude, makes him a made for TV D list character.</p><p>Too bad.</p><p>On that note, the whole production feels and LOOKS like a FAN made 'You Tub'e project, as if some rabid movie fan was desperately trying to entice a studio into 'professionally' Kick Starting the project.</p><br><p>The 'Wanna-Be' Mark Zuckerberg 'Jesse' Character is even more pathetic than the original character.</p><p>He is uninteresting, not fun to look at, and his dialogue is boring at best.</p><p>His narrative makes little sense, and it's hard to tell that this is supposed to be a sequel of the movie, as it's never established these events take place after the FILM.</p><p>If you were a casual viewer, unfamiliar with the great film, you would be like, 'What the FUCK? Who ARE these people, and why should I care?" after 5 minutes of viewing.</p><p>The jokes are on par with 'Scary Movie Part 5000'.</p><br><p>I use the word 'Jokes' lightly. I LOVED the film, and I laughed often. But upon my viewing of the 'TV Show', I DIDN'T so much as SNORT ONCE.....at ANYTHING.</p><p>The 'jokes' are based on......ummmmmm.....</p><br><p>Nothing.</p><br><br><p>There is a running gag about clueless office workers as the zombies attack just behind them, and a character never heard of in the movie, an On-Star employee, who is supposed to be the 'witty, black, comic relief', but her lines are worse than a Volkswagen Commercial, and just make we, the viewer, feel like 'she' is guiding us joke to joke.</p><p>(Why is an On-Star employee still at her post, and not running home to her family???)</p><br><p>Bottom line, ZombieLand the TV show, is nothing more than a mis-cast, soulless, heartless, humorless, production with good intentions.</p><p>It was done ENTIRELY WRONG IN ALL WAYS.</p><p>It had potential as a weekly series, but whomever was responsible for bringing this schlock to fruition dropped the ball in EVERY WAY possible.</p><p>Skip this piece of shit, and join me in asking the studios to just give us ZombieLand 2 with the original cast on the big screen.</p><br><p>Follow ZombieLand Rule # 14:</p><p><em>Always carry a change of underwear</em></p><br><p>Cause you never know when Hollywood is gonna SHIT on you.</p>

                <p>amm. i agree the last line! hollywood is a heaven AND a hell in same time. i don't watch so much zombies because i am only 13. but i agree that the film's star player ( or main character ) should run to her family ( or his ) in movies. it's just my taste . but how the hell a movie is going to change based on something you wrote here? you can say this on the movie's web site. it's surely more effective that way</p>
