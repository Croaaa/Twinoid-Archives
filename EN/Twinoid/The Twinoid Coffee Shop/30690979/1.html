                <p>I've had those moments, and I'm sure some of you have too, at some point in your lives, the moment at which you realize you shouldn't have said what you just said.</p><p>Someone mentioned the Grand Theft Auto V game in another thread in this sub-forum. Whenever someone mentions that game series, I sometimes think of one of my "Oops, I reallly wish I hadn't said that" moments.</p><p>There were some police officers in my house one day a few years ago. One of them saw my console video game collection and asked which game was my favorite. Not really thinking about the person who asked the question, or his coworkers standing around him, I was honest and said "The Grand Theft Auto series." Realizing afterward that I mentioned a game where the player can go around beating up and shooting police officers, I stammered for a few seconds and tried to say I didn't do those types of things but just liked the story line. It was a <em>very</em> uncomfortable moment. lol</p><p>What are your "Oops, I wish I hadn't said that" moments? I know I can't be the only one who has experienced a foot-in-mouth incident.</p>

                <p>I play baseball at a high level and last year, I was speaking with another player and we were talking about the coaches. Well, I said that I thought that a certain coach was really dumd and the other one hated me because I was better than he was a my age, anyways, they were both walking by right when I said it. They just stared at me and walked on. It was not fun...</p>
