                <p>Somewhere in a wonderful valley of a mountain, a bear was eating some poisoned candies. He was tired of negative scores on bowling and seeing trolls called DD321123. He decided to call Ghostbusters, but they denied helping because they were too busy eating pie filling. Suddenly a giant pumpernickel pie said: "I like your pink frilly dress." The bear blushed and told him: "I ate your children's faces while you were sleeping." The giant pumpernickel ninja-kicked the creature behind him. He was angry. His name was Chuck Norris and he ate disgusting worm filled with rusty nails since he was the epic king of KadoKado. Team Epic's original members were idiots but now, power fueled their butts and they grew beyond measure. Suddenly, the Piouz turned into zombies and died horrifically eating their own intestines with seasoned fruits. Meanwhile, sheep were painting a picture of a really cool guy called MadDonut, it falsely said, Plugger was the loser in Fakeland -MadDonut was in Awesomeland- Plugger was cool. Suddenly a giant pumpernickel pie said: ♫ MadDonut ain't awesome. He's even better. Said the liar and died. Luckily I lived. But then Snap added some juice. Snap, Crackle, Pop and their cats looked doubtfully at the lava flowing through MadDonut's jacket into his underpants. He screamed as loud he could, the pain was bearable, but his mouth was infected with Plugger's horrible garlic bread. Slowly Plugger became awesomer than normal, but became a slime whom someone poured ten thousand slimes in the toilet. MadDonut rinsed his <strong>good ol' toilet</strong></p>

                <p>Somewhere in a wonderful valley of a mountain, a bear was eating some poisoned candies. He was tired of negative scores on bowling and seeing trolls called DD321123. He decided to call Ghostbusters, but they denied helping because they were too busy eating pie filling. Suddenly a giant pumpernickel pie said: "I like your pink frilly dress." The bear blushed and told him: "I ate your children's faces while you were sleeping." The giant pumpernickel ninja-kicked the creature behind him. He was angry. His name was Chuck Norris and he ate disgusting worm filled with rusty nails since he was the epic king of KadoKado. Team Epic's original members were idiots but now, power fueled their butts and they grew beyond measure. Suddenly, the Piouz turned into zombies and died horrifically eating their own intestines with seasoned fruits. Meanwhile, sheep were painting a picture of a really cool guy called MadDonut, it falsely said, Plugger was the loser in Fakeland -MadDonut was in Awesomeland- Plugger was cool. Suddenly a giant pumpernickel pie said: ♫ MadDonut ain't awesome. He's even better. Said the liar and died. Luckily I lived. But then Snap added some juice. Snap, Crackle, Pop and their cats looked doubtfully at the lava flowing through MadDonut's jacket into his underpants. He screamed as loud he could, the pain was bearable, but his mouth was infected with Plugger's horrible garlic bread. Slowly Plugger became awesomer than normal, but became a slime whom someone poured ten thousand slimes in the toilet. MadDonut rinsed his good ol' toilet because he loved his dimwitted chicken and Edi's cow- not really, but <strong>he did fight</strong></p>
