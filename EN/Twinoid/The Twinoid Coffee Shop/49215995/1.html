                <p>(TL;DR &amp; CS at bottom, first few paragraphs explain the synopsis a bit and then goes into story)</p><p>This is an RP with elements of Log Horizon. (or SAO for you younger ones, however the former is much closer to the events of the RP) It takes place in the fictional universe of Star Citizen (which has IMMENSE backstory which I will be pulling from at times) Really the only thing you guys need are these two links:</p><p>Map: <a href="http://starcitizen.mojoworld.com/StarMap/" target="_blank">http://starcitizen.mojoworld.com/Star...</a><br>Ships: <a href="http://starcitizendatapad.com/ships/specs" target="_blank">http://starcitizendatapad.com/ships/s...</a> (contains most ships &amp; crew number)<br><a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/ship-specs" target="_blank">https://robertsspaceindustries.com/sh...</a> (Contains all ships and no crew numbers, just google or ask me for info if it a ship you want is not listed above)</p><p>Backstory: Do you remember the start?</p><p>The years is 2020. Star Citizen is in it's final day of beta, after which everyone's items and stats will be reset for the final release of the game. In the Star Citizen universe Humanity, or the United Earth Empire, UEE for short, is at war with the Van'duul, an aggressive warlike race.</p><p>As the Beta came to a close, a plan that was conceived even before alpha finally went into action, Operation Pitchfork. It is a call to all Players and Organizations within the game, and it states: All humans meet inside Van'duul space at the end of Beta for the biggest fight in the history of Star Citizen. We'll either succeed and wipe the Van'duul out or die trying.</p><p>And So here you find yourself, with your organization, preparing to jump into Van'duul space. Your Organization, ASG, while by no means a small one, pales in comparison to some of the larger fleets.<br> You even manage to spot a few Javelin Destroyers as the flagship of some of the fleets. Your own organizations flagship is an Idris-M, outfitted with heavy guns and artillery for the fight to come. It's not as large as the other flagships, but it still represents the group effort of your entire organization</p><br><p><strong><br>TL;DR</strong>: Log horizon-esque RP in the fictional universe of Star Citizen. The timeline is set at the end of beta in the game. Humanity is at war with a species called the Van'duul and the game is about to be wiped. Every human player has come together to fight the Van'duul on the last day of Beta when they have nothing to lose. You are currently preparing with your organization known as ASG.</p><p>Relevant SC info for RP: <br>Map: <a href="http://starcitizen.mojoworld.com/StarMap/" target="_blank">http://starcitizen.mojoworld.com/Star...</a><br>Ships: <a href="http://starcitizendatapad.com/ships/specs" target="_blank">http://starcitizendatapad.com/ships/s...</a> (contains most ships &amp; crew number)<br><a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/ship-specs" target="_blank">https://robertsspaceindustries.com/sh...</a> (Contains all ships and no crew numbers, just google or ask me for info if it a ship you want is not listed above)<br>_________________________________<br>CS:<br>In-game name: preferably an actual name</p><p>Appearance:</p><p>Home planet: for simplicity sake, It's Earth, Mars, or Terra</p><p>Ship(s): 1 medium sized ship (3-6 crew) or up to 3 small ones (1-3 crew), see ships link</p><p>Profession: Explorer, Security, cargo runner, trader, asteroid miner, information runner, Electronic warfare fighter, pirate (basically if you can do it in a ship in a sci fi universe, it's a job, is not limited to one.)</p><p>Anything else: <br>____________________________________<br>Example CS:<br>Name: Rob Nodalsky<br>Appearance: Tall, slender, slightly athletic with short brown hair and hazel eyes.<br>Home Planet: Terra<br>Ships: Mustang Delta, Avenger, Reliant<br>Profession: Security/Smuggling<br>Anything else: Ship in use for Operation pitchfork: Avenger</p>
