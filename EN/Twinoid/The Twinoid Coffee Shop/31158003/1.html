And its happening everywhere! The car wash, Post office, outside the community center! My friend and I were walking the dogs in town a few weeks ago and went to watch some police road block on the highway, and we walked through our campground and through a lil gazebo... and GUESS WHAT WAS IN THE small cement gazebo. <br>YES IT WAS! <br>yup thats right, serial pooper struck again.</p>

                <p>Once upon a time, in a real estate inflicted world, our intrepid heroine fought a losing battle against horrid, ancient, and decrepit beings called... REALTORBEASTS. *shudder* These salivating beasts may have once been normal humans, but somewhere along the line they sold their souls to the God KellerWilliamsReMax and found that they were immortal. In fact, the older they are, the more dangerous is it to find yourself in their vicinity. The worst of the REALTORBEASTS tend to be 300 years old on average and respond to the twin mating calls of "Money!" and "Free Food!"</p><p>In this land, she who is Pocky toils endlessly, chained to her desk and forced to answer the phone when these REALTORBEASTS call with idiot questions such as "How do I turn my computer off?" and "Why do I have to follow the rules?"</p><p>Then, disaster happened! Pocky's evil Boss-Beings declared that they were getting rid of the database that they had been using for the past 14 years, and instead updating to a new shiny system. You'd think that this would be a good thing, as new shiny things tend to attract money.... however, the REALTORBEASTS shun all change (unless it's silver and going in their pockets) and instead yell at those who try to make them learn and change.</p><p>And so, the past year of Pocky's life has become a living hell, as the Boss-Beings try to pretend that the REALTORBEASTS are friendly while Pocky's coworkers run off screaming in joy to the unemployment line, leaving Pocky with more work to do without even the benefit of alcohol.</p><p>And so, this story will continue.... (After I pass out... just finished working 12 hours)</p>

                <p>Awww Miner, that sucks for you . But it also sucks the most to be that student <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":tid_sad:" class="tid_ico"> To have noone like you and to know it must make him feel so sad and alone.</p><p>I wonder if there is anyway someone could tell him about this. Young adolescent with personal hygiene problems, maybe he just needs someone to teach him. Could you maybe privately talk to you teacher about this,and ask them to talk to him with a positive approach. Because you dont want to really get involved at all, I'd think, cause you are getting along with the majority of people.</p><p>I'm sure many people can empathize and feel for you, feeling like an <a target="_blank" href="http://gyazo.com/e92630399139929d7845c0456efbf268">Outsider</a> sometimes. Gosh, I bet we all can say we have felt that way at one time or another, specially in high school!! But keep in mind, it is the unique people and the free thinkers that make the world turn.

                <p>I agree completely with Joanne. The kid might also not have adequate care/support at home, so if someone (teacher) talks to him out at school, that might be especially helpful.</p><p>You said nobody likes him, but sometimes it just takes one person talking to him as a friend to get him to open up and be more socially appropriate (i think you already hinted you did that, so cheers if so). I went to school with a girl who got picked on a lot and who hardly ever talked. Before class started one day I initiated a convo with her and we started taking regularly. Think that was the first time I saw her smiling, and she did speak up a little more in class after that.</p><p>I used to work with a guy who farted and didn't try to hide it. He was an odd one overall, but the most "normal" people I've known have always been the <em>most boring</em>.</p><p>I think I'd be on medication if I had Pocky's job. Hope you've got a good mental health plan!</p>

                <p>yes i actually get along whit him a lot better (admittedly after a bleeding nose from both of us) than a year ago. tho i see the state he's in now is EXTREMELY better than it was, he's atleast partially included in the group because he's listening to us talking atleast but he's silent all the time because he doesn't do anything we do like play certain videogames (and if he wanted to play them we mentoned them quite A LOT of thimes before), a fact i didn't tell about him is tht he's a difficult learner (i think that's how it's called, he reads slowly and isnt' the averege in succes).</p><p>but all in all i don't think the state will get any better in the rest of the year we have (this is the last year of primairy school for us), tho i do hope they will.</p><p>a nother student in class is a girl thats all in all a bit odd, and not something in her personality but in her acts.</p><p>She ALWAYS misses more than half of te school year LITTERALLY. last year she was in school for just 3 weeks or so in total. and she always misses any tests or something like that we have. me and my schoolmates are suspecting she is ditching school and that her parents are not doing something about it, on the contrary, we believe they're even incouraging it if she wants to do it. this was led up because her sister NEVER, AND I MEAN NEVER SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT IT, we ask her something, she says: ask her when she gets back etc...</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil"><span class="tid_sideNote">a small fact about me, i wear a jacket when other people are wearing T-shirts <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></span></span></p>

                <p>One time I was showing a mom and dad how to use an infant apnea monitor. The dad had a really bad cold so I couldn't let him in the neonatal intensive care unit. (NICU)</p><p>I took them to an empty Breast pumping room. They sat on a small settee in front of me. <br>The dad was miserable with his cold and kept wiping or blowing his nose every few seconds. The hospital policy, for legal purposes, was that anyone that would be left alone with the premmie baby had to be able to use this life saving machine and checked off on it before the baby would be allowed to go home. I am very professional. I pride myself on it.</p><p>So they are sitting there and I have the machine on my lap facing them. The machine is made to emit a shrill alarm if the babies quit breathing for more than 20 seconds. This is not only to alert the parents but to scare the baby awake to take a breath. I had set up 100s of them. And then the parents would bring us the chip from the monitor monthly so we could download the data. The babies had to wear the monitors 24/7 for 3-6 months</p><p>The father is snuffling so bad. And I felt sincerely sorry for him. <br>So I point to the silence button. And the purpose of it is to silence the alarm for 10 seconds only. But if you hold the button for 5 seconds it will reset the alarm. Safety feature.</p><p>When I point to the button I intended to say. "You may think its off. But it's not" <br>But what I heard come out of my mouth when the father was again holding the tissue to his nose was <br>"You may think its off. But it's snot" <br>I was horrified. And they were stone faced. I started laughing. So hard. I couldn't stop. I was so ashamed at laughing at something so juvenile that it was this horrified half hysterical laughter. I had to excuse myself to find some control. They were offended. Of course they were! I returned and finished the 45 minute training. Very apologetic.</p>

                <p>Another time I had to visit a 4 y/o at home. They needed an assessment for a new ventilator used for sleep. I was on my way home and offered to do the assessment.</p><p>Hispanic family and the child's name was Jaime. Pronounced "hymee" <br>He had a tracheostomy but like any 4 y/o was very active and only needed the vent at night.</p><p>I had a rather short skirt on and form fitting. I was talking to the mom in the lil boys bedroom and he had a toddler bed. I had been talking to her a few minutes and then turned to the child's low bed to set my bag down. Maybe because the bed was so low I bent over more than I normally would? But just as I bent over I felt my skirt being pushed up. I had on nylons. Jaime sunk his teeth into my right cheek. I instinctively pulled my skirt down but it also covered his head. So not only is his teeth gnashing away at my butt. I have him trapped there. I didn't want to hurt him so I started turning in circles trying to shake him loose. The pain was wicked. The mom was circling around me and hitting the top of her son's covered head yelling "no hymee, bad hymee" over and over. I had to lift my skirt up all the way so she could pull him off me. All my coworkers made fun of me forever.</p>

                <p>Sorry for the long ranty post... I will post more amusing things later.</p><br><p>OMFG I'm gonna hurt someone. Or I need a drink. Or I'm going to hurt them while drunk. I spent 40 minutes on the phone earlier today with someone who's all butthurt that she wasn't able to submit an offer on a property, and she wanted a written explanation from the seller on why the seller accepted an offer. First of all, we don't require the seller to submit anything to us saying why they decided to accept an offer... it's not our bloody business. Second, if we DID require it, we still wouldn't give it to another agent due to client confidentiality. Basically, this property was entered but was in a "no show" status because the client was doing repairs. Someone submitted an offer without seeing the property (investors will submit sight-unseen offers often, and so do other people occasionally) but the agent who called was submit that it was marked as pending because it was officially available for agents to show it. Umm..... if the seller wants to accept an offer from someone who hasn't seen the house, how can we stop them?</p><p>So the agent kept saying that we need to require proof that the offer was submitted sight-unseen, and I kept explaining that we don't ask for proof.... we have no reason to suspect that the agent and/or seller are lying... and she kept saying that they are lying and we should require proof. So I told her that if she thinks someone is behaving unethically, she can report them to her board. So then she gets angry, saying that she never said that the person was acting unethically.... umm, you said that they were lying and that we can't accept their word and need to require proof. So yeah, you ARE suggesting that they are unethical (in fact, she ever called them unethical at the end of the call).</p><p>Then she asks me if I have kids and tries to give a scenerio about kids fighting and that we're siding with the kid who punched someone else, and just taking their word that he didn't punch another kid.... WHAT?! Ummmm.... lets take our crazy meds and get back to the real estate, my having kids or not having kids has nothing to do with our rules.</p><p>Then she tells me that God and Jesus will judge me. *rolls eyes*</p><p>I gave her ALL of her options... submitting a rule change request to our rules committee (no, she's not going to do that but our rule is wrong and should be changed...ummm, how do you think that it's going to get changed?!) or contacting the board to file a complaint (no, she's not going to do that either) but instead she wants to talk to my manager because she says that I don't understand her question.... Of course, her question is "How do you prove that it's a sight unseen offer?" and my answer was, "We don't. That's not our job. We have no reason to think that they're lying, and we don't require them to tell us WHY a specific offer was accepted."</p><p>*Sigh*</p><p>I got off the phone, found a piece of molten chocolate cake and told everyone that I wasn't available for more calls until the chocolate was gone.</p>

                <p>I just got back from work and I have to admit I had an amusing day...</p><p>There's these two senior colleagues at work who have some kind of feud going on. There was this new project that one of them was supposed to do but they both insisted that it was the other guy who was supposed to do it. Now, normally I'm the one who does this type of project but the boss has me busy covering for someone else and told me this new one wasn't my responsibility. I offered to help them with it anyways but they both declined because 'the other guy is responsible for doing it'. So basically they both just let it sit while they go on about their own business because they both had quite a bit to do anyways. At some point, one of them did the very first part of the project and left it out in the open so the boss would notice the lack of progress the next time she came by.</p><p>The person who was really supposed to do it didn't get fired but needless to say, the boss wasn't too happy. She didn't know of the work place shenanigans going on but somehow the other guy was assigned to help with the project because it was so behind. So they ended up having to clean up the mess together on top of the new stuff they normally would have needed to do.</p><p>I live in a sitcom <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>my first job was working for a restaurant/catering company in New Zealand, one day i was delivering a load of food for a meeting at the NZ rugby union HQ, as i was struggling over to the lift with a stack of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rehrigpacific.com/images/products/full/bbtm23d003.jpg">bread crates</a> (easiest way to carry a load of different platters as you get 2 per crate), a voice called out, "hey bro, let me help" and lifted the stack with ease, i looked up to see <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah_Lomu">Jonah Lomu</a> the most famous rugby player in the world at the time, he then carried them over to the lift, came up to the floor with me and carried them into the meeting room. asked if i needed anymore help and then walked off, Was pretty cool to find such a famous guy to be so humble and helping</p>
