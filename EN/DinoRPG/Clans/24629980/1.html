                <p>Hello people of DinoRPG, MJ here. Our clan, <strong><em>The Paradino League</em></strong>, is more than a year old now, and we had some great times in it. <br>But our clan ain't a regular one. We are not about fighting, championships and Clan Wars. If all that sounds too exciting for you to lose, stop reading this right now and go see other posts, maybe you'll find a clan suitable for you, you bloodthirsty beast. Ahem, as I was saying, we are mostly peaceful, and just enjoy our community as it is. <br>But, the actual point of our society lies within <a target="_blank" href="http://en.dinorpg.com/cinema">this</a> temple. Yes, we crave to gather all filmmakers into one clan, and repopulate the cinema. I know a lot of you guys never heard of Cinema Paradino, and I know the ones that did are not interested in it, but this post is not for haters.</p><p>So, here's the deal. If you know about Paradino, but don't like it, leave now. If you don't know about Paradino, but don't like the idea of making films in DinoRPG, do the same. However, if you like the idea of Cinema Paradino, there is only one requirement for you. You need to have at least one submitted film. It doesn't matter what it is*, as long as you submitted it, you're welcome in our clan.<br>We look forward to new recruits. Our clan will provide you with useful instructions on how to operate the film editor, and also some useful tips about the game itself. So join us, and expand the community of <strong>The Paradino League</strong>!</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">* We won't accept people who just make a random film without any sense and by doing that exploit the fact that mods don't have any power over the cinema, so they cannot delete it. Either make a real movie people will actually enjoy, or don't even get near Cinema Paradino.</span></p>
