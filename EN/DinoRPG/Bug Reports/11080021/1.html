                <p>Hi folks,</p><p>like everybody on the English server, we argued about the pros and cons of the existing CotC Systems. After a lot of talking, I had the idea about a system, which could provide nearly balanced fights.</p><p>It's <strong>based on the original powerlimit</strong>. First all of the clans who want to participate get a week to <strong>register their dinos</strong>, creating their powerlevel. There will be a powerlevel ranking afterwards.<br>Now u create <strong>groups of eight clans</strong>, starting with the most powerful. e.g. clans 1-8 in Group 1, clans 9-16 in Group 2 etc.</p><p>The powerlimit for each group is the <strong>powerlimit of the weakest clan</strong>. So for Group 1 it's the powerlimit of the clan ranked 8th. The clans get a second week to <strong>register their dinos again</strong>, using the new powerlimit.</p><p>So the weaker clans get the chance to use their best dinos, while the top clans in each group have to overthink their strategy. Fights should get much more exciting this way.</p><p>Battles will be the fights against the 7 other clans of each group.</p><p>Some open points: Matches will be harder so maybe there should be some fixes:<br>- change prizes: not only for 4-7 wins, but also for over 200 points in each battle or for more than 2k movements?<br>- power limit: on the battlefield useful?</p><p>I would like to see you guys discussing this idea. Maybe adding some details, or pointing at some more open points.</p><p>Ndeline</p>

                <p>in addition to the mentioned power level there should also be a restriction to level up the registered dinoz. recalculation after a level up wouldn't be useful in this system as the ranking could differ quite alot which would lead to another new registration of the battle teams...</p><p>at least if we still went by the former system it'd be useful to put a lvl-up-blocker on the registered dinoz or recalculate the power level after a levelup/every midnight server save...<br>many players seized this "feature" last time <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>This is a good idea. Means the clans are more evenly matched and battles will be decided on strategy and skill ... and of course very well leveled dinos. Having more time to prepare is also good. Should there be a limit on dino levels as well else you will get clans entering level 40's with lots of level 15-20's to bring down the power. If the other clan has all 30's (for example) a group of level 40's would roll through. Although if you could break the 40's you would have won the battle.

                <p>It is way harder to raise a good level 50, than raise a good level 20. So those fighting the TOP power should get the TOP rewards. Those fighting in the BOTTOM should get the BOTTOM rewards. The equality for small clans getting the big clan rewards is pissing me off. Not because I am cheap or because I don't think they have to fight hard with their equals to get them, but because it makes no sense what so ever.</p><p>Let's say got a job as a professional sportsman. You can have a beer-belly and fight other beer-bellies for millions of $$ same as the guys who spend their every waking minute training to get stronger. So what's the reason to train? Better go open a beer! No, your logic is invalid in my eyes and I cannot grasp this stupidity. But do prove me wrong, please.</p><p>As to commenting the actual proposed system.. seems intredesting. In F1 usually the fastest cars who qualify get the best starting position.. I wonder why. But, yeah, this is no F1. Sure they also have some drivers and teams who will never be TOP notch and so they keep changing the rules there also and breaking the whole sport imo.. but that's what I've heard at least, I stopped following that race in some 97' I think. I am off-topic again..</p><p>Let's try to get back. I'd like to look at some facts about our situation.. I have no idea who is how strong so I'll check MK's Hall of Fame as that is the one I found first. <br>TOP8 from the last mentioned event there = RAksha, Loot, Cook, VA, MK, BBC, GC, LBT. If these 8 met in the same CotC group.. what would be the power difference? Let's say anything goes and anyone can place 45 with no power involved.. I guess it would be tough for the others to fight Rak, but I have no data to prove this. I guess it would also be sad to be at the power end of this group = meaning you are the weakest link and you will have to fight the hardest to survive. So you might want to get some steroids to boost your spirit.</p><p>To think of it, your idea is intredesting.. but I would not go as far as cutting everyone to lowest limit. Meet them half-way.</p><p><cite>So the weaker clans get the chance to use their best dinos, while the top clans in each group have to overthink their strategy. Fights should get much more exciting this way.</cite>This part I don't like one bit. It's dangerous thinking. You cannot punish the strong for being strong. They worked hard to be strong and you want to make them work hard again now to get weak? It's an easy and simple solution but it's unfair to the core. We are talking about a championship for god's sake. You don't make the top team to cut 1/2 of their players just because their top 5 players are better than your top 5 players so you could just try and wait for them to get tired and then steal the glory because you have other players to put in the game and you did not allowed their other players to participate to make things more "fair". Basically you are suggesting <em>they should overthink their strategy about being strong</em> - as it's not exciting enough for the others. We could do that. We could break the clans to limit only 25 masters and we could have 2x as more clans to fill in the power gaps. OR we could throw out the CotC event completely and make different teams for a basically the same event just call it differently and have smaller teams of masters. OR we should do no such a thing? Maybe we can live with the fact that, if we can't beat someone then it's not their fault for being strong but ours for being weak.</p><p>It's not like there isn't a limit already. You can have 50 masters in a clan. You can have 21 dinoz for each master. And the level 50 is max for each dinoz. Those are your limits, if you want to call this a CotC!</p>

                <p>OK, now when I am done spreading my propaganda, I can admit that we will probably never get my desired <em>not clan</em> but <em>different kind of team</em> based event.

The question is how much to cut/add and how.</p><p>Could we come up with a solution that would not limit the TOP to having only 5 masters participating?

                <p>We have the problem with the number 8 maybe. How about if it was only 6 or 5 - but make them fight each other 2x?</p><p>Looking again at the MK's Hall of Fame. I'd be willing to go against the top5 with the (A+B)/2 board's power limit like the old times. 100-150 dinoz team limit. 45 dinoz board limit. Keeping the fights short and active.</p><p>Making the prizes count for EVERY win, yes, even a prize for 1 win. Setting the prizes for each next league slightly worse.

                <p>So far all of you mentioned some good points, that I forgot.<br>and there are some others, that i got in mind after completing my post:</p><p><strong>@ powerlimit:</strong><br>You shouldn't be able to see the other clans power rations and for that the powerlimit ranking shouldn't be updated in realtime. maybe once every 12 hours.<br>otherwise it would lead to abuse (as seen on Spanish server).</p><p><strong>@ level up:</strong> <br>should of course be stopped after the first week of registration. levelupcounts to registration (as seen on Spanish server)</p><p><strong>@ different prizes for groups:</strong> <br>I think everybody should be able to get nappos. who should judge, which clans are weak, and which are strong and will get nappos. would be unfair. so they should be rewarded to every group. but why not give more demon notes or even better more bons to the stronger groups, making participation more attractive. There will always be clans, who rather want the awards than the excitment. but that shouldn't bother anyone. It's an event which should make fun. and it will, if u fight against equal enemies.</p><p><strong>@ powerlimit a+b/2</strong><br>wouldn't make any sense in my proposal. because it would mess the whole system with generating equal strong groups. and rakshasa won't have to face clans with level 20 dinos. So there is no comparison.<br>I don't get rid of that feeling, that you guys don't want exciting fights, but to get your rewards without competition.</p><p><strong>@ smaller groups</strong><br>that's an overtrinkable option. But I think it would be more fun to face different enemies, than the two times the same. If so, I'd prefer groups of 5, making 8 fights for each clan.</p>

We could just take a look at the powerlevels and then decide as a community, in case no trolls start up, what would be the most fair thing.<br>Like league 1: 1-5 : raksha, loot, MK, VA, Cookies<br>league 2: Fete, BBC, GC, LBT, voodoo, CoG, polish, gdj<br>league 3: Froggizs, RA, DE, Axie, CB, Root, UL, Rampage.<br>League 4: Headed by CuF</p><p>This is what my league system would look like.<br>Even though PL placed worse than others in League 3, they are pretty strong, they just didnt took part in the rushed wintrading-chains at the end, and they were probably just satisfied with their rank, seeing the cost/prize relation. THats why i put them in League 2<br>Clans like Froggiez and RA Can move up or down if they like to, it will depend on what their powerlevel will look like, we cant force anyone to register anything they got. If poqemon, marion and co arent going back to<br>root, they will automaticly (probably) move down to league 4. If they get more reinforcments from loot, they even might move up.<br>See what i mean ? If we make a community based ranking like that, and tweak it slightly dependend on how much PowerLevel is accuired, everyone will be happy. <br>Hell, i dont even care if we, gc, have to move up to fight the toptier monsters. We are just going to give them some headaches and go down with a fight, thats what its about, not rewards.</p><br><p>another fought of how to make the fights itsself more balanced, regarding the combination with ndelines "lowest league clan=points-cap" idea from ndeline:</p><p>Let the clans give out their powerranking, just count 3 dinoz per member with a factor of 1.0. Count the next 3 dinoz of each member with a factor of 1.2 ... next 3 with 1.4 and so on. This way, even clans with 3 topdinoz per member could fight mostly on par with the likes of rakshasa... IF they manage to get the upper hand in the first few fights, the additional topdinoz of that mentioned clan have to go back up into formation, while the other clan, seriously outnumbered if it would come to a reinforcement flooding since they only have 3 really strong dinoz per member, would have a slight advantage, if they keep up the good work. I admit that its pretty hard to implement though.</p><p>I´d really like to hear your oppinion, dear clans and speechman:<br>Whom of you wouldnt be satisfied with my proposed leagues, if we keep the prizes almost identically ?</p><p>(winner of league 1: 3 napos ( hell who cares, they are swimming in napos anyway, so give them something additionally for having spend so much time, love and money into the game)<br>winner of league 2-4 : 2 napos<br>rankings 2-4 ( 2-3 in league 1) : 1 napo ( 2 in league 1) )</p><p>The real reward problem is with the bottom clans of league 1. We need to give anyone a good reason to try and fight the toptier clans. I wouldnt mind getting no reward at all, for the sake of challenge and fun, but i/we cant force anyone to stand on lost ground just because everyone is afraid to fight them and is pushing them into toptier ( by name: cookies and VA )</p>

                <p><cite>There is a need to differentiate, or else what is the incentive on having high level dinoz?</cite>Why does the CotC need to be the incentive for that? We have Mana War, Clan War. Actually CotC is the best format of those three, because - when the system works - your dino strength does not matter, but instead it matters how well you play as a team.</p><br><p><cite>I'll just go with low power and rule lower levels with items from steppes</cite>you make it sound like it would be so easy. But no honor in that when Luso would participate in one of the bottom leagues, your call but I would laugh about you <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico">.</p><br><p><cite>Also, like I said, it serves to incentive clans to go full power, or you will see clans going low to avoid other clans.</cite>no need to avoid other clans, the system would prevent the clans you "fear" to be stronger in terms of power level.</p><br><p><cite>It is way harder to raise a good level 50, than raise a good level 20. So those fighting the TOP power should get the TOP rewards. Those fighting in the BOTTOM should get the BOTTOM rewards. The equality for small clans getting the big clan rewards is pissing me off.</cite>Way to say "I don't want new players to have fun and rather be an elitist on a slowly dying server", because that is what will happen if you don't also respect and cater to the newer players - Napos should be accessible to anyone who plays well and that also counts for small clans. In Mwar or normal war we don't have the chance to award a clans activitity and coordination, dino levels count far more. So I always see CotC as a chance for smaller clans to get some part of the cake.<br>Also I don't think DinoRPG is hard in any way. Just pretty luck dependant.</p><br><p><cite>To think of it, your idea is intredesting.. but I would not go as far as cutting everyone to lowest limit. Meet them half-way.</cite>I'd rather have all have the "same" chances. I know this is not going to work in DinoRPG perfectly, as power limits don't count dino strength perfectly, but that is all we got.</p><br><p><cite>This part I don't like one bit. It's dangerous thinking. You cannot punish the strong for being strong</cite>Wow, we "punish" them by actually having to prove their coordination, activity and teamplay skills once if they want a price. Think back to the last CotC, where CnD maybe had 1-2 decent fights. Is that more fun for you? Do those top clans need that for their ego? Or do they actually want a challenge? I am sure what I would chose, but since this is a browser game, maybe the tendency really is a different one.<br>Reducing the number of clans per group would not be too bad, but it probably should not go below 6, if we want so see a decent number of fights. (with 6 we could do 5 fights, then a KO battle between 1st and 2nd for place 1 and 2 and KO battle of 3rd vs 4th deciding places 3 and 4, so we got 5-6 fights depending on how well you do)</p>

Lets say one clan got many now inactive players that really helped them out in the last events, they wouldn't match the other clans in the group well. So division into groups by power ranking entries imo is better. I know your post was mainly about the number of clans in each group that you think would fit best, but as we don't know who participates where -&gt; hard call to make.</p>

                <p>I think you don't have to worry about this:<br><cite>The real reward problem is with the bottom clans of league 1. We need to give anyone a good reason to try and fight the toptier clans. I wouldnt mind getting no reward at all, for the sake of challenge and fun, but i/we cant force anyone to stand on lost ground just because everyone is afraid to fight them and is pushing them into toptier ( by name: cookies and VA )</cite>I am pretty sure VA and Cookies will not turn down a chance to fight Raksha, Loot and MK with or without any prizes <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><cite>Wow, we "punish" them by actually having to prove their coordination, activity and teamplay skills once if they want a price. </cite>You mistook the idea behind my comment - I am all about putting everyone for a challenge. But Knowing previous CotC we even saw fights where Rak was able to position only some 5 dinoz on the board due to the strong limitations by the power and that was with the (a+b)/2 - with just the B it would be 1 dinoz? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> - sure the situation has changed a lot by then and we can hopefully find a clan who will not be afraid to put their dinoz in top8. The best way to do this is by luring them in with better rewards.. because even though we have a lot of hard-core challengers who will take on anything that moves - we also have those who want their time and effort to be worth something.</p>

                <p>especially since 45+ and lvl 50 restrictions are ridiculous. Not that your overall idea is bad, but making a difference between lvl 49 and lvl 50 is just wrong. Take me for example: I have 3 lvl 50 and 3(+1 in a week) lvl 49 dinoz. A lot of people dont even care if its lvl 49 or 50 since the difference is redundant, and it takes a ton of irmas to get their. So THIS is where you are really punishing "strong" players who were running around with 50 since nimbao day 1.</p>

                <p>Who would want to fight the same clan twice? <br>I'm sure you've had battles where you were absolutely thrilled by the close competition and it could have gone either way, but most of the time I think it would be no fun to face the same competitors or someone who is "out of your league." If a clan has no "worthy opponent" (take last CotC where 1 was paired against 2-6), then don't give them a fight. Not sure how to make this "fun" or "fair" for that clan, but it isn't fun for anyone else when a system caters only to specific points in the ranking.</p><p>I want a system where it is possible to fight the clans closest to us in strength, not ones 6 more ranks in strength or 6 less.</p><p>How many "pass" rounds did we have last time? Too many.<br>I want a system that rewards <strong><em>great</em></strong> fights. Win or lose. Not wins for clans without a decent fight on the battlefield. Did your clan give it your all against a worthy opponent, but were simply taken out by their coordination and skill? The other clan gets the real prize, but you could get a consolation prize of irma, bread, etc. to make up for what was lost.</p><p>No idea how to implement something like that, but who wouldn't want to fight if there was nothing huge to lose (aside from time you could be leveling, doing quests, gaining gold, etc)?</p>

Second: the system leads to smaller differences, meaning smaller problems in that department as well. It is obvious to me, why do you have problems with understanding how it would work?</p><p>Leagues are a big no go. Needlessly discriminates some clans that just fit worse into the profiles that are imposed.</p><br><p><cite>Zony, whatever you say, if top clans aren't more rewarded for having more power, then never a registration system will work properly, because clans will prefer to go lower power and avoid top clans</cite><br>At least napo prices should be consistent. Treasury notes or Demon Notes could become gradually higher in stronger groups, nothing against it. The only real advantages of a big clan participating in a much lower league would be magic items and nimbao potions. Mby deactivate mono and nimbao potions for lower leagues? A no-item cotc sadly does not work because poison dominates too much in lower leagues.</p>

                <p>My System doesn't work with leagues. It's about Powerlimit. And It would make all clans register at least 3 strong dinos per active member. Because getting into a group with to low restrictions would cause every high or midlevel clan massive problems with getting enough dinos on the battlefield. On the other hand, the top 8 clans, that make up group 1 would at least be able to deal with 45 lvl 50 dinos. or more lower level dinos.<br>Nobody who wants to get good fights would have to fear, he can't participate and with the right prize politic, all clans can be animated to register all they have.</p><p>This would provide massiv and exciting fights, without clear feavorites per group (as a fight GC vs Rakshasa or Loot would be in the actual system)</p><p><strong>I'd like to see this discussion staying on topic, therefore discussing my proposal, not things some people posted here, who obviosly weren't reading what the initial post was about.</strong></p>

All the other discussions lead nowhere, because nobody talks about the ideas. Someone makes a Porposal and afterwards, the players say: "your idea sucks" or "i don't like this and that" etc.<br>But now you are here, reading, what my idea is about and stating: "I like this part, but at this point, i'm not sure if it would work that way, you should rather do it that way."<br>That's how we will manage to get to a new system, that most player will like and which is worth introducing to epoq.</p><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_489943 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="489943">Husaurus</span>: Yeah you are right, the more-prizes idea needs a little improvement, it was just an idea i had while i was writing, to motivate the Clans, to register a maximum of dinos for the events. Because I know, that Loot and Rakshasa fear, that they don't get enough dinos on the field with this system. So instead of lets call it "Battle Achievements", there should be more gold for each higher group. So all register der maximum of Dinos.</p><p><span class="tid_user tid_user_65 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="65">Kayin</span>: Nobody wants to punich big clans for beeing big and investing money into the game. But lets say the first Group is about: Rakshasa, Loot, VA, Cookies, MK, Fete, BBC and GC or LBT, everyone of us trying to get to the first group. Meaning we at GC register more than 3 Dinos each player, to get to group one, because it will be the funniest. Rakshasa and Loot should be able to get enough of their sphere-monsters onto the battlefield. If that is not, what your argument was about, please tell me what point your problem is about, and i'll try to find a solution. Also you could point your clan mates to take a look into this thread. I'd love to get some more feedback from the strongest clan, because I want all clans to have fun.</p><p>I'll write a conclusion about the actual state of my idea considering our discussion</p>

                <p>So, I'm a bit late, but I think this idea has real merit.<br>Ndeline, don't worry too much if not everyone follows your requested thread rules (Lord knows I've been guilty of this in the past <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":tid_innocent:" class="tid_ico">). It is a forum, and it happens, but if you quit on the idea it may die. I think it's best to just push ahead despite some road bumps. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":tid_smile:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Another idea to add on, if we are concerned that some of the top clans might not be able to fight with all their top dinoz due to this format, and may not get the prizes they "deserve", perhaps some incremental prizes could be given out to the clans that have the highest initial power ranking in the first registration. This could also act as an incentive for people to register as strong of dinoz as possible.</p><p>Also, I think Ndeline is right, if you have other good ideas for CotC formats, make a new thread and lets discuss them. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":tid_smile:" class="tid_ico"></p>
