                At the moment everybody is politely ignoring the big elephant in the room that half the forum mods (including the two most active ones) have resigned.  I PMd one of the remaining mods to ask if it was okay to start this thread, but didn’t receive a reply, so I’m going to assume it’s okay.<br><br>I feel that now might be a good time to discuss the forum and specifically the forum moderation.  I’m sure we all have different ideas about how the forum has been moderated in the past and how it should be moderated in the future, but any discussion of this topic has been quickly silenced.  Now most of the mods have gone, maybe we can discuss this without it being construed as being personal or some kind of attack on authority, but instead as a bona-fide suggestion on how to proceed in the future.  I think it would be good if we kept individual names or incidents out of the discussion so that it can stay impersonal and as positive as possible.  Posted below are just my thoughts and ideas, so if you disagree with all or part, then go ahead and say so or (better yet) post your own ideas.  Also, following recent events, I guess I should point out that these views are entirely my own and not posted on behalf of my clan.<br><br>I think the fundamental problem with the forum as it exists now (or existed two weeks ago anyway) is that it is over-moderated.  It is a forum that probably gets only about 100 new posts per day (that’s just a guess, as I don’t really visit the Chaos Tavern) but it is moderated like a forum that receives 2,000 posts per day, with too many moderators trying to enforce too many rules with too little leeway.  This causes several problems such as:<br><br>1.  Rules that aren’t really necessary for a forum this size being enforced religiously, without any real thought about whether they are sensible.  For example, the main justification for locking threads that go off topic or are ‘low content’ is that they push more useful threads off the forum.  But is that really a problem when threads currently take a week to even leave the first page?<br>2.  New players (or older players new to the forum) see a bunch of locked threads and mod intervention in every other thread and it makes the forum look intimidating.<br>3.  Mods are forced (probably largely subconsciously) to create work for themselves to justify their own existence, whether this is moderating threads, disciplining users or coming up with big ideas for new rules or reorganisations that aren’t really necessary.<br>4.  The more laissez faire mods are effectively made redundant.  If one mod decides a thread is fine and another mod decides it isn’t and locks/heavily moderates it, then the opinion/decision of the first mod is basically meaningless.<br><br>Obviously this isn’t entirely the fault of the moderators themselves.  They didn’t invent the forum rules (well, most of the time <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif">) so really all they are trying to do is enforce them as they best see fit.  Neither is it their fault that we are stuck with extremely crappy forum software, I’m sure they were just as annoyed by that as we are.  Nevertheless I think we should concentrate on the things we *can* do something about.  So here are my proposals for the forum going forward.<br><br>1.  Less mods!  How many did we have before, six?  That’s too many for a forum this size, I think three or four would be plenty.<br>2.  A clarification of what a mod actually does.  Mods should be there to perform a specific function and that function should be clearly defined.  There shouldn’t be instances where mods are using their powers to do things that are not directly part of their job.  For example, mods should never edit their own posts to remove something they regret saying in a regular discussion.   And they shouldn’t create threads and then try to enforce new rules on that thread that are not part of the regular forum rules.  In short, when not actually moderating, mods should obey the same rules as everybody else.<br>3.  A generally more relaxed and tolerant attitude towards moderating (a lot of the ideas below stem from this).<br>4.  Less rules on what can be posted on the Game Discussions forum.  Start with the assumption that any thread is okay unless there is a strong argument for removing it, rather than the current policy, which seems to be to lock anything that doesn’t check a rather stringent set of boxes.<br>5.  Rethink the “General Questions” and “Skills Thread” threads.   I think these were created with the best of intentions, but the end result has been that most useful discussion on the forum has been squeezed into these giant cumbersome threads, where it is impossible to find anything and discussion can get confusing at times.<br>6.  Rewrite the disciplinary guidelines.  These are way too rigid and draconian and people are getting banned completely needlessly and for way too long.  Two weeks for a first offence of ‘recidivist moaner’?  Forum bans should be an absolute last resort, not something to be thrown around like confetti whenever someone breaks a rule.<br>7.  A rethink on many of the forum rules.  Some are unnecessary while others are impractical to enforce.  Also there are some ‘rules’ that don’t actually seem to be in the rules themselves but have rather been invented at some point or creatively extrapolated from existing rules to give them new meanings.<br>8.  Encourage the use of common sense in all aspects of moderating.  Rather than a mindless enforcing of some rather sketchy rules, moderators should about think whether each decision they make is actually making the forum better or if it is just moderation for moderations sake.  Moderators should have some leeway in the enforcement of the rules and should hence be accountable for that enforcement rather than being able to hide behind the rather tired “I am only following the rules”.<br><br>Anyway, as I said these are just my suggestions, maybe other people have different ones.  And just to reiterate please try to keep this positive and impersonal.  This is not about having a go at current or former mods, it is about trying to improve the way things are done in the future now that we basically have a 'fresh start'.<br><br>Fire away

                Sorry, that ended up rather longer than I intended.  Cliff Notes are:<br><br>- Less moderators<br>- More relaxed and informal attitude amongst the mods that remain<br>- Less rules on what can and can't be posted and where<br>- More common sense and flexibility

                I like the idea of this thread but i disagree with you on somepoits<br>1. The rules seem fine as they are and if anything are underenforced, as how many people get a ban on there first offence<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/question.gif"><br>2. I agree with you there some people are intimidated by this<br>3. Not really true but it may happen from time to time.<br>4. Actually to say the least the forum was undermoded to start with and now its running like a skeleton crew<br>      As for your solutions<br>1.We need more mods not less<br>2.Yes there should be a classification as to what mods do<br>3. The forum needs to be user friendly like you said as people are afraid to most on the forum<br>4 the rules are fine as they are<br>5. I think they should stay as they remove clutter from the forum but i see what your saying by having to look through hundreds of posts for the right build<br>6. I agree the disaplin always varies from set punishments <br>7. There rules are fine as they are<br>8.I dont think that happens anyway<br><br>Hope a mod/ ex mod comments on this as it would be interesting to see there view

                1. Less mods? Yes! No need for 6, which I have told Epoq myself aswell. <br><br>2. Yes, a mod should follow the same forum rules. <br><br>3. I myself tried to be a relaxed moderator. And I agree that mods should loosen up.<br><br>4. See 3<br><br>5. I created the Skills Thread to prevent an overflow of threads about pretty much the same thing. I rather see 1 thread spammed with it as 100 individual threads.<br><br>6. Well, I don't know who sends out 2 week bans immediately, but I did no such thing. A warning at least, without any consequence.<br><br>7. These are the rules that MT made standard. If we want a change then Epoq should have a look at it, before everyone bashes mods again for making up a bunch of rules.<br><br>8. See 3.

The rules that MT has created to be used by the mods must be set in stone. Right now many of the rules are open for interpretation and that is not good at all.

                1. Three would work fine. A too much active moderator would probably take 80% of the work. And then, better have four, in case of time coverage. Two american, two european. Right now it's useless to pm a mod in the server morning.<br><br>2. A moderator is a normal player with only a bit more powers than others, and with those powers come heavy duties that are: moderating the forum, report multi-accounts, report any clanpages, avatars, account &amp; dinoz names being too off-chart (meaning transgressing the Terms &amp; Agreement).<br>We also help people when they are asking something (either in forums or pm). Though sometimes they took us for admins or bank workers <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/lol.gif">.<br>So as normal players like everyone else, we must follow the rules.<br><br>3. Ok, on that it's pretty simple, I was doing the evil moderator (oh nooes I've said the truth, will I be censored? <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/eek.gif">), diverting eyes from the main problem etc... Mean tactics yeah. Though I dislike the Rule #5 the most.<br><br>4. And you didn't see how the FR forums are, if you think we were strict, go there. I'm continuing on...<br><br>5. Anyone that would ask for a simple question have to do it in "General Questions", simple question requires simple answer, generally a "yes" or a "no" or one or two sentences. If someone want to launch a debate, he can open a new topic. That's the way that topic functions. Though skills discussion should be personal. But some people would complaint about reading only that everyday... well not everyone could be happy.<br><br>6. MT forum rules are all the same in every of their games, though the number of time you get banned is up to moderators on some other games, and not written like here. Hence, personal ban history (warnings and bans) can lengthen your bans.<br><br>7. Well, I think the forum rules were badly translated by Phantom, that's all.<br><br>8. Errr... you said that a moderator should follow the rules like any players, and then you ask them to not moderate you coz you don't want to hear them "I'm following the rules"? Well so this comes back to a problem within the forum rules, then.<br><br><br><br>I'm adding something, MT forums are private spaces, which can be read for public eyes (if you google it), that so-called heavy moderation is to flatten down MT public image.

                From the "Problems:"<br>1) No one expects this server to remain small, least of all MT. If so, why even keep it running and supported? The rules are uniform across all of MT's/Muxxu's forums and games if I'm not mistaken. And if they (MT/Muxxu) were to edit out rules now, then add them later (when the server populace was much larger) the "Draconian" label would be thrown around at that point in time.<br><br>2) I can agree with this to a point. Some new threads could probably be moved to the appropriate area(s) and then the main initiating thread in the General Forum simply deleted. i.e, "I'm looking for a clan......." But then the question will arise "What are the Mod's deleting?". So there we have more room for accusations of Abuse of Power which gets thrown around all to frequently when it probably shouldn't. And when there is a question of Abuse of Power, instead of throwing it out in the Forum, it is probably best handled in a PM to Support/Admin....or maybe even to another Mod.<br><br>3) As a Mod in another forum (uncompensated like the Mod's here) I just don't see this as happening. It's not a job, it's a service that is being done for free out of the goodness of their hearts, hopefully for the betterment of the forum itself and the users. This forum is largely self-moderated in that we control what we post, and ensure that it is within the guidelines and rules. We are also largely "Self-Policed" in that most threads/posts outside of the set guidelines/rules  are reportable to Mod's/Admin via the <strong>! ALERT</strong> Button.<br><br>4) Though this sounds a lot like Anarchy I won't go into that. However, I think I agree with the possibility set forth in the example. What one Mod may not see a problem with, another Mod might...Or for that matter where one Player may see a problem (or rule violation) with a post, the Mod(s) might not. And as such is open to interpretation. The Mod's can, and do, make mistakes. They can, and have, also correct(ed) them.<br><br>Now to the "Solutions"<br><br>1) A possible solution was recommended above. But this is also "creates" more work for the uncompensated Mods. And they should enforce all the rules with thought, and without prejudice. At what point can they, with clear conscience, start enforcing rules that weren't being enforced from the start without allegations being thrown around? Answer: Never, if they (the rules) weren't enforced from the inception of the rule or guideline.<br><br>2) Agree with the 1st part, Disagree wholeheartedly with the 2nd part. Mod's are Players/Users too. And are allowed to offer Suggestions just like any other player. The only real difference is that they offer their "free time" in greater amounts than most players, to do what is largely a thankless job for the community as a whole. And since this point  was brought up because of the CLO thread idea, and that there was another thread (started by me in the main forum for everyone else to post their feelings to) I think that this point is largely moot. And it wasn't until someone posted a violation of Article 2 Rule 4 (and possibly 7) in that thread that the thread was locked. So on one hand, a simple request was made and was expected to be honored; while on the other, a clear violation of the rules was not enforced as some Mod's chose to "let it slide."<br><br>3) I think the forum is really very relaxed as it is...and probably under-moderated. We just lost 2, and possibly 3, of our more active Mods.<br><br>4) I'm not a Mod here so I don't know of any check boxes, but I assume there isn't such a thing, hahahaha. However, as in the case of the "I want a clan....." type of thing. I've already offered a solution to that. The overall forum is cumbersome. Archival of old posts/information would clean it up. But then information would likely be even harder to find for newer players. And then the newer players would be repeating "old" questions. And I really don't have a problem with that. Answering the new/old questions again refreshes that information in my mind too. It just adds "used" space on MT's servers, hahahaha<br><br>5) Um, Subforums? i.e., Kab section, Wanwan section, GP Joe section, etc? Possible? You get the idea. I think it might be a good thing. <br><br>6) And I quote <cite>Two weeks for a first offence of ‘recidivist moaner’?</cite>. I don't know your history on warnings and bans, but the Mod's do. But I also know that you got away with threatening the Mod's. So let's see, a 2 week ban for <cite>‘recidivist moaner’</cite>...or a more lengthy one for a Terroristic Threat towards any Mod that moderates you? Again I quote you, <cite>(if it gets deleted because I'm not a clan leader someone may very well get killed)</cite> So, it's a Lose/Lose for the Mod's either way.<br><br>7) As i see it the rules are pretty fair.<br><br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif">This would imply that <strong>all</strong> posters use common sense too. But that is an impossibility. The Mods do what they can to try and keep the peace, and to keep the forum peaceful.

For example, let's say a newbie comes on to the forum for the first time and creates a sort of introduction thread that is, shall we say, low content.  Now *technically* according to the rules this could be called a useless topic and the user should be given a three-day ban, but just because the rules say that doesn't mean the moderator has to do it.<br><br>Admittedly a lot of the time common sense is used, but sometimes it isn't.  In the above scenario for example the user was banned and a week later they had quit the game.  I'm not saying the two events are connected, but it surely can't have helped.

                I agree with most things.<br>There's no such thing as a "useless" topic and even going a bit off-topic now and then isn't bad at all, it creates a nice mood. I think the moderators here are indeed doing their job too well...<br>Many rules on here are quite stupid and are pretty much the reason why this isn't a relaxed fun place to talk with people, but mostly just long boring discussions with a lot of personal fights... Not that serious discussions are bad to have, but where's the mood?<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/rolleyes.gif"><br>The bans on repeated offenses are really stupid, especially when they're so long. The only thing they do is scare the people away from the forum. It's that I'm quite a forum-junky, otherwise I wouldn't be here anymore either after some ridiculous bans... A 2 week ban for posting a youtube link and such... Oh no, I'm supposedly advertising a site that everyone on the internet has heard of, what a big deal, he should be punished heavily for that <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/nooo.gif"> THAT is called common sense, and I totally agree with that mods should use that. I also moderated a game + its forum for some time, and just using common sense when judging and being relaxed is much better for the overall mood than being mr. forum-nazi.<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/rolleyes.gif"> Like the example, banning a newbie because he accidentally broke one of the rules... that's just stupid imo. Banning should be done on people that really do certain things on purpose and won't quit, not the people that don't mean to do any harm but just make a little mistake.<br>Being relaxed is much better for the mood, by being tolerant and relaxed I even got trolls to listen to me back then... while with blindly and strictly following the rules you only create agitated people -&gt; bad mood.<br>From what I've seen I think lolwhut (yea, sorry for throwing names, but it's not badly intended anyway) indeed did her job well, at least she was relaxed and tolerant... more mod's should follow that example, judge every offense by themselves and not just blindly follow what the rules say. Some mods really make me think that if the rules would say "jump off a cliff" they'd still blindly follow...<br>Long story short, I think the forums here are pretty boring and bad-mooded, and I think the reasons for that are the over-strict rules + their moderation. Come on, it's a forum, not a work-camp.

                Moderation was great before imo.  Only thing that I'd like to see less of is locking of a thread because of 2 or 3 off topic posts.<br><br>And Piemaster, I'm quite sure the mods follow the rules of moderation.

                I think Luiaard has made a valid point. Mood may subconsciously play a large role in this game, or any other game for that matter, since most people (I assume) play the game to have some fun and relax for a bit. I found the attitude and tone of some mods while giving warnings/bans to be quite harsh for a game and hardly constructive. This only drives casual/new players away from the forums and from the game itself. That said, some rules have to be reformed in order to loosen up this kind of attitude in some moderators. Take rule # 5 as an example, what this rule generally does is make moderators unaccountable for their actions. It only emboldens the more "aggressive" mods by making them impervious to any feedback from the parties involved. Sure you could send them a PM with your personal take on the matter but I believe those are often dismissed and fail to have the impact you would hope for.  I propose a sticky thread (In the "Suggestions and Bugs Report" forum) where questionable sanctions by moderators could be discussed by everyone (including the mods themselves) and allow the mods to explain their rationale for those decisions. This, in my opinion, would add some transparency in cases where a moderator interprets a rule as they see fit and end up overreaching their authority.<br><br>People often underestimate the impact that the forum has on the game but keep in mind that the forum, along with clans, are the primary source of knowledge of the game for every player (especially new or inexperienced ones) and as such, should be kept as friendly as possible to ensure a healthy and stable player base.

                <cite>The bans on repeated offenses are really stupid, especially when they're so long. The only thing they do is scare the people away from the forum. It's that I'm quite a forum-junky, otherwise I wouldn't be here anymore either after some ridiculous bans... A 2 week ban for posting a youtube link and such... Oh no, I'm supposedly advertising a site that everyone on the internet has heard of, what a big deal, he should be punished heavily for that </cite><br><br>well, if you keep breaking the same rule repeatedly - then the punishment should just continue to be warnings? why have rules at all in that case? <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br>4 youtube links = 14 day ban, not too unreasonable in my opinion, if you didn't learn from the warning and previous short bans. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/rolleyes.gif"> looks like you quit posting them after you got the long ban... so it worked? Moderators do not get to type in a number of days to ban, it is done from a drop down list.<br><br>and again<br><cite>Like the example, banning a newbie because he accidentally broke one of the rules</cite><br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/arrow.gif">That only happens in serious offenses, like posting bad words on every topic you can find.

If you would like the rules changed, then epoq is the one to change them. However, as I said before, warnings are given first except in the most serious of cases (or if the thread has been warned already).

                I must have missed all the drama but I thought the mods were doing a good job.  Even when I was given a warning at times there was a reason, even if I was only trying to be funny.  There was never anything illogical about it.  We have the mibbit channel to be silly and rambling don't we?

                <cite>Could you state specifically what you want from this? What is impractical? What is unnecessary? (Don't get me wrong, I'm not arguing- I'm asking.)</cite><br><br>Well a good example is the spoiler rule, which is both unneccesary and impractical.  It is unneccesary in that anybody who doesn't want to view spoilers can simply not look at the thread.  If you're that worried about accidental spoilage just crate a separate thread where spoilers are allowed and mark it clearly as such.  It is impractical because if anybody *does* want to find out spoilers there are many ways they can do so including clan pages, PMs and other websites.  Plus, what constitutes a spoiler?  If you take it to its extreme (which unfortunately some mods have) the entire 'new content' thread that is always opened is redundant because there is nothing that you're actually allowed to discuss in there.<br><br>Another example is the YouTube 'rule' that you were just discussing with ABS.  What harm is there posting a YouTube link?  How does stopping people posting them (and banning them when they do) make the forum a better place?  In fact if you look at the forum rules you will not see anywhere where it specifically says you can't post links to other websites.  The only rule that comes close is the 'advertising' one and it is a monumental stretch to call posting a link to a song advertising.  That neatly brings us to the last point which was extrapolating existing rules to create new ones.

                <cite>I agree with less mods. Yes, we had 6 - but how many did you see moderating?</cite><br>Well that's an interesting philosophical question which raises an important point.<br><br>I didn't want to make this thread personal (and hopefully we can still avoid that) but let's name some names out of necessity.  In the last mod team there was you and Kurio who were very visible on the forums, doing a lot of locking, deleting, warning, banning etc.  Then there was LOLWhut and Andy who did a lot less of the above, then there was Over2 who was somewhere in between.  The other guy, whatever his name was, I didn't really see do anything at all.<br><br>But the problem is, while Andy and LOLwhut didn't really *do* much, some people would argue that is because not much actually needed doing.  Let's say there is a post that LOLWhut looked at and thought it was okay, but then you looked at and decided to delete.  Both of you have done the same amount of work in that you both looked at the post and made a decision on what needed to be done.  But only your work was actually visible and, in fact, rendered LOLwhuts work irrelevant (nobody get in a tissy, remember this is a fictional example).<br><br>Many people, me included, would argue that if you don't see mods doing much moderating, that doesn't mean you don't have enough mods, or that they're not doing their job, it means that they are doing their job *well*.  It's no coincidence that on many of the best forums that I visit, I don't even know who the mods are off the top of my head.

                Piemaster, do you have some interesting subjects other than mods? Are them the reason you play this game? <br>Just ask for a star ...you deserv it. Maybe yours should not be green, because you are far better than all other mods <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif">...and probably they get good <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> for their job. I am sure you will come everyday with new topics and you will make this forum so alive...like the demon shop.

                I have to agree that there's some issues that should be changed regarding the mods. <br><br>1) The excessive number is one of them. 6 mods is way too much for a forum with the little activity this one has. <br><br>2) Maybe it's me that can't find it but there should be somewhere (and somewhere visible) a list of the current mods. If one wants to ask a question about moderation, complain about something it's not easy to know where to contact, specially if you're a newbie and don't know you're way around.<br><br>3) Some rules should be updated. For once, the fact that we're not allowed to post links to youtube/pictures/whatever that are not dinorpg related seems silly to me. <br><br>4) Yes, more tolerance is also a good thing. Maybe nowadays is different, I haven't been paying much attention to forums lately but in the past I saw warnings and bans flying for simple things.<br><br>5) More transparency. This also comes together with point 2. But I see many posts getting edited and threads closed without any indication of the mod that did it. I think it would help transparency to know who is the mod responsible (as well as allowing us to contact that mod in case we want to understand better the reason for the edit/deletion/etc).

                Youtube links should be allowed in Chaos Tavern (appropriate obviously) as everywhere else as long as they're Dino-Rpg related.  Actually, links in general should be allowed in forums as long as they're game related.  For example, right now I can't even link a calculator for the % chances of getting a certain # of elements in a certain amount of rolls that Piemaster showed me a long time ago and it's really useful.

                <cite>well, if you keep breaking the same rule repeatedly - then the punishment should just continue to be warnings? why have rules at all in that case? <br>4 youtube links = 14 day ban, not too unreasonable in my opinion, if you didn't learn from the warning and previous short bans.  looks like you quit posting them after you got the long ban... so it worked?</cite><br>It'd be fair if I broke the rule on purpose... but still, 14 days for a youtube link? I think 3 days at most would be fairer, really, what's so bad about a youtube link, it's not like it hurts anybody...<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/rolleyes.gif"><br>And well, that last ban of mine of 14 days wasn't even my fault... that was a youtube link posted to a video with DRPG-content, but I still got the ban cause that mod "thought I was provoking him".<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"> After that he ignored my pm, good old rule #5... Doesn't make me respect a mod much if they act like that.<br>+ It's not like I did it on purpose or something, I just didn't understand that advertising rule, cause I didn't see how posting a youtube link would be advertising...<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/rolleyes.gif"> If I'm spamming a website on every topic, ok, but this... come on, use some common sense...<br>And that it stopped me from posting them doesn't mean it's good. In some Islamic countries they cut your hand off when you steal something. Yes, that person would probably not steal again after that, but doesn't mean that it's justified...<br>Basicly the only thing I thought after that ban was "damn, what a bunch of whiners... screw that forum". And like I said, it's that I'm quite a forum-junky and returned out of boredom, but others aren't and would really not return. And it didn't do well on my opinion on this forum either... nor does it on the mood if you punish innocent people for little things like that. And that's where the common sense comes in... imo, and that's how I always modded, the people that purposely intend to do harm should be punished/banned, not the people that didn't understand/read/accidentally broke the rules while not meaning to do any harm. Rules aren't holy, they're just guidelines to keep things in good order, they're made with a purpose and it's that purpose that's most important, not the formulation of the rules themself... At least, that's my philosophy on it...

                Now that I can see who is getting warnings and who isn't I have to say that it seems that 1% of the members are causing 90% of the rule infringement.   Really, you would think that they would learn by now.  I have a ban myself although I don't remember the incident.
