                I was am currently having an ongoing conversation with my clan about the benefits of being in a clan, and for supporting the game through purchase of <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_tix.gif"> or <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif">.  <br><br>The general consensus of benefits to being in a clan are as follows.<br><br>- Clinic<br>- People to talk with<br>- Clan event rewards (assuming your clan ranks well enough)<br><br>Our topic has quickly changed from the the 3 listed above, but to what the benefits of being in a clan could be. <br><br>The main topic we're currently discussing is the possibility that a being in a clan that does good during a CW, or CoTC offers a reward/Trophy.<br><br>Which are fine in their own right, but in addition to that a reward such as for winning a clan war could be something as simple as Double Actions for a week for the clan. <br><br>IE, Your clan members are allowed to move twice a day, without an IRMA. <br><br>Anyways, the options are limitless. <br><br><strong>This is my personal opinion</strong><br><br>My caveat with the game, Pay-to-Play options seem lacking, you are able to buy either <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_tix.gif"> or <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> for a rather large amount of real cash, and gain nothing permanent for your account, unless you buy a Dinoz or something else from the marketplace. <br><br>So why aren't other options available for purchase from the SMS or Credit Card options. <br><br>I know someone would say "But if you can buy anything then no one would play". <br><br>Well that is true, but I am not suggesting everything be for sale. Simply creative items, Say 2x XP for a week which can be applied to your account, or if the devs so like to a single dinoz. <br><br>In my opinion for the money many players spend there should be a better option then to spend it on <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_tix.gif"> and <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> only... <br><br>Any comments welcome.

                <cite>With that, by selling in game currency, helps to remove that strategy from the game by allowing people with either deep pockets, or no other expenses to Rush through most of the game play.</cite> Gold is not the only game currency. Napodinos are more valuable than gold and cannot be bought or traded.  Having a lot of gold can allow faster advancement, but does not begin to remove the strategy from the game.  Leveling Dinoz properly takes more than gold... it also takes luck, research, and effort.  Look at most players' first Dinoz, they are usually high level and useless.<br>To advance further (and to where in many players' minds is the real game play and strategy), requires competition, which increasingly cannot be bought, because of the leveling field of play.  Throwing money at the game can take you pretty far, or farther faster, but it is not the end all... a lot of competitive players and competitive clans are not big spenders, and some are not spenders at all.<br><br>Anyway, I can't help but notice you seem to be arguing cross purposes.  At the same time saying that buying stuff with real money diminishes the game play and also requesting more things be offered for sale for real money.  I don't get it... except your account seems to be at a level where you need to figure out what you are doing, and how to advance... and in the absence of figuring that out, it might appear that the game is broken or your progress is stalled.

                Ya i truncated the title for the topic when I posted. <br><br>The stock benefits to being in a clan are as follows. <br><br>People to talk with. <br>A can clinic (if you yourself haven't built one)<br>And clan events. <br><br>So say Cloak and Daggers wins the CW, they are obviously going to get the rewards listed in the post for rewards. <br><br>But separate to that, or in lue of it, they could be rewarded in a different manner, say double motions, or increased rest rate for some length of time. <br><br>As for the topic of spending money on the game, if it where to be through "x item provides x benefit" those same items could be granted through repeatable quests for each item. <br><br>So lets say the item I really want is "Double Moves". <br><br>I can either spend x cash in the shop, or do a quest chain by what ever quest giver and earn the reward. <br><br>That is what I was/ am trying to explain. It would obviously be added content to the game, which I know is a no no to discuss. <br><br>On the flip side being able to spend some real cash with your first dinoz and then go to the market place and buy some dinoz is just as over powered as any such item / perk could do.

                Husaurus, <br><br>I think you are missing my point. I am not saying that there should be some incredible benefit to being in a clan. <br><br>But there should certainly be some benefit of both, playing solely and of being in a clan. Each having their own benefits. <br><br>For your point of a wealth of information gained from being in a clan, I can without being in a clan, find plenty of clans that publicly post guides on the best practices to leveling and building a dinoz. <br><br>That is public knowledge. <br><br>As for your other points, I've already pointed those out. <br><br>- Clinic<br>- Clan events. <br><br>So what's your point? What I am saying is there should be a obvious benefit to being in a clan, or to playing solo. <br><br>In addition to that I am trying to suggest other rewards for clans that do the best during clan events. <br><br>I am not saying, "Oh this sucks, change it so I can feel like I'm not such a bad player."<br><br>Anyways... ya.

                I have a lot of useless and failed dinoz based on that public information.  I think the quality of the input is much much higher from experienced clanmates.<br><cite>What I am saying is there should be a obvious benefit to being in a clan, or to playing solo.</cite>You've admitted there is obvious benefit to being in a clan, so you want a benefit to playing solo?<br><br>Well, the biggest benefit to playing solo is that most of your Dinoz can be PvE builds, which are much easier to level, and much easier to be impressed with.  The exception to that would be your Dojo builds, which is a non-clan oriented competition... and Dojo PvP builds are not strictly traditional PvP builds.  So your Dinoz can be more Dojo/PvE specialized, and hence that is an advantage to playing solo.<br><br>However, expecting people to be locked out of game features because they joined a clan wouldn't be fair... so, advantages to playing solo would not include special items and rewards.  The advantage to playing solo is that the game is much simpler without the competition of the clan events.

                Sharing items will never happen, because Multiaccounting is illegal, a problem, and a threat to fair play.<br><br>There is also strategy to picking, joining, and building clans.

                So what you are asking for is any type of benefit that a player obtains ONLY when he is in a clan? Also you are asking for any type of benefit that a player obtains ONLY when he is not in a clan?<br><br>Instead of asking for the impossible, prove how the impossible can become a reality lol. You said about exchanging ingredients ONLY as an example and there are viable points about why this would never work: multi accounts, the market price for kabaku ingreidents would be non-existance (a good clan has gatherers who could just give the ingredients away) and countless other reasons. Give us an example we cannot prove would not work lol.<br><br>As for benefits for not being in a clan, all someone would have to do is leave thier clan in between events, gain these benefits, then join the clan again. Things like player vs player battles already exist in the dojo, so the only other type of benefits i could see you wanting for people not in clans is free stuff...which as I said would be easy for everyone to obtain.<br><br>Now going back to your VERY first message on this thread: <em>Which are fine in their own right, but in addition to that a reward such as for winning a clan war could be something as simple as Double Actions for a week for the clan.</em> At first this idea sounded good, since I lack patience, however, I then realized that i rather recieve a prize I could use whenever the need arises (which is the case with <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_tix.gif"> and <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif">. Lets say you got double action points for a week but you left for vacation after the war was over. Now you do not get to use the benefit that you worked hard to obtain, and your dinoz have nothing to show for whatever hard work you placed into that event. Now instead you were given gold, an item which you could use during the next war to better serve your dinoz. For this point i would never want any prize in this game that i cannot use when I WANT TO. <br><br>So you are talking about adding new items that may temporarily increase your defense or offense attributes for a given time (something that boost your power so you can beat the dragon perhaps?) This item you could use at any time, it increases your fighting attributes for a short period of time (whether it be one battle or one week), and it allows your dinoz to do things they otherwise could not do....Oh Wait thats what items like temporary manipulator, beer, scale, lighter, refrigerated shield, monochromatic, antidote, and reflaxive pill already does. Some of these items you buy with nappos others you buy with gold...In the end this game already has things you ask for. You want these things just by doing well in a clan battle? Why not give everyone in your clan gold so they can purchase these items IF THEY WANT TO. Hmm it sounds like we are back to what this game already does.<br><br>Finally, if you are asking to be rewarded simply because you joined a clan, simply because you participate in any event this game offers, or simply because you play this game without being in a clan that my friend is stupid. Why should you be given anything for meritocracy? I feel this game gives out ample prizes for those that spend and for those that do not spend and play wisely. If you feel otherwise then you may want to rethink the strategy you use in this game

                slyfox1619,<br><br>Thank you for the in depth reply to this conversation. But your tone is condescending and not appreciated. <br><br>I do concur with your points and that these many of the possible features are already in the game, ref shields, etc. <br><br>On the topic of double turns for a week, it could simply be an account item that could be used when ever, there is no stipulation that it is active immediately after the clan event.<br><br>My entire point to this topic was to try and think up some alternatives to the stock rewards for all clans and players. <br><br>You also mentioned that a mediocre clan shouldn't be rewarded. <strong>And I've already said that in a previous post.</strong> A clan that doesn't get to a certain rank shouldn't be rewarded. Cost of playing the game. I agree. <br><br><br><br>So rather then taking pot shots at my ideas, try and create some creative methods to improve the game.

                I fail to see the point of this discussion, apart from the obvious. People get benefits from being in a clan, but generally it costs coins or moves to be in that clan. The more coins or moves that its members donate, the more likely it is that the clan gets better rewards. If people want more, they can change clans and if they want to do less they can expect to be kicked from top clans. <br><br>You balance how much you put in to the game with how much you get out. Simple.<br><br>As for 'improving' the game, lots of games have been ruined by changes that broke the balance. I don't think the idea of additional rewards has gained much support.

                Additional rewards and items are always there for everyone in the game. As long as the event is totally new to this server, I think it is generally agreed upon that whatever prize is given (like a new egg) is acceptable because everyone is given a chance for something new with a new event.<br><br>In this game you cannot add any type of prize or item without adding a new event to gain said prize. If you did so, people who spend substantial amounts on previous versions of the same event (ie clan wars) would be upset that the prizes are not just an improvement from the previous same event, but totally different. <br><br>In that respect if any new type of items (nappo items, store items, eggs, an item that increased your exp for a week, etc) are introduced in this game first a new event would have to be offered. <br><br>The issue with this is that this game has events, and other prizes after they are done at least once on other servers or at the very least at the same time as the other servers. (I cannot think of one event or prize even probably the box cutout of dinoz, that was not tried on another server first.)<br><br>So you could call this topic "New events for dinorpg", however, I do not know if any ideas would be used in this game without testing on another server first. <br><br>Sorry for sounding condescending before, but I like the flow of this game as it is and I like the changes that are provided when they are provided. As good as it would be for our version to be so much different then other servers...well.... I dont think it is possible. So my solution to you is if you have a great idea that could be useful for the clans is check the other servers first... Suggest it there first...play it there first...because only when they try it first...will it end up being added to ENGdinorpg.
