                <p>I know that many people in the high level "super clans" will dislike my idea, but I think that the maximum number of players allowed in a clan is too high. I just left a large clan myself, and it was mostly because of participation. I was never bullied or intentionally left out. I just felt that more often than not I would be in the way if I got involved. My suggestion is that we cut the clan maximum down to 30 players, and here are some reasons why:</p><p>1.) CotC. The are 45 spots available for dinoz per clan. This means that if each player used only a single dino, five people would still be left out. Most people prefer to use the three dinoz that they are allowed. In all honesty this makes me feel the clan maximum should be 15 or 20, but I'm trying to make a compromise for those who like being in big clans. (Please remember that before you start throwing rotten tomatoes my way. Haha.)</p><p>2.) Automatic wins/competition. Lately I've noticed that to receive a prize most clans have to do very little. Oh sure, if you want to come in first then you have to work hard, but to get prizes doesn't take much more than entering. I know we live in the age where "everybody's special" and "we're all winners" and if you are the absolute worst you're just the "last winner". I for one just don't see the point in having a competition if all you have to do to place is enter. I don't mind losing if that's what ends up happening, but I don't have fun winning when it takes no skill or effort to win. I think cutting down the clan maximum would cause people to try a little harder and make the battles more interesting.</p><p>3.) Sponging/loafing. This is another reason I left my previous clan. I was entirely guilty of this and I apologize again to my former clan for this. Because my help wasn’t really needed I just coasted along, doing just enough to not be kicked from my clan. Hey, I was still winning right? What fun is it to win though if you haven’t really helped to obtain the victory? What does your trophy mean if you got it by just sitting on the sidelines? I think smaller clans would keep people more involved in their own accomplishments and as a result would keep people more interested in the game.</p><p>4.) New Players. I know as a new player it was intimidating enough just to get to the level of competing against a single person in a single battle. Now add on to that having to find a whole clan of people willing to cooperate with you to try to compete with a whole clan of people that outnumber and overpower you. I think smaller clans would help limit this. I won’t say the problem would be fixed. Maybe if the clans were dropped to 15 or 20, but again I’m trying to compromise. My question is who do you know that would want to join this game right now? Unless they’re super rich and can drop $1,000 on the game how are they ever going to hope to catch up? My fear is that with no new faces and little opportunity to work up through the ranks, we will get few or no new players. With no new challenges people will get bored. Once people get bored… game over. I don’t think any of us want that.</p><p>5.) Support your vendor. I’ve heard people trying to be critics about the company just trying to get money. This has always been confusing to me. This game is a way for someone to generate money the same way any other product is. That doesn’t make them evil or greedy. The people running this business need a way to provide for themselves and justify the time and effort they put into running and building this game. If I had the knowledge of how to build an online game and get paid for it, I would much rather do that than work my lousy day job. I doubt most of you would say anything different yourselves. If the clans are smaller and more people are in competition to be the best, they’ll probably spend money to do it. New comers have a better chance at catching up and joining with other new comers to form competitive clans. Now they’re willing to spend some money to catch up. The company wins. They keep the game running and keep things interesting. We win.</p><p>So that’s my suggestion. The critical component of this game for everyone involved is fun. I think I’ve shown how this change could be important to everyone involved in that aspect and I hope I’ll have the support of the staff at MT and the community of dino RPG. For those of you who would like to show your support, I have changed my profile photo to a picture with the number 30 in it. If you’d like to take that same picture from my profile or find any other picture with the number 30 and use it on yours I would appreciate it.</p><p>-Javon</p>
