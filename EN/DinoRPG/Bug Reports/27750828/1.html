                <p>In topic about community growth I wrote a little aboout how to improve participation rate in Clan Wars.</p><p>This topic I created to clarify my idea and improve it in some way<br>(even though it may never be released).</p><p>So, how I see a new system:</p><p>1.Clan size should be decreased to 30. Instead new Alliance System should be added. So clans may organise alliances with it's own names and additional alliance forums. Also it should be added Alliance Rankings based on sum of participants points.</p><p>2.League System should be added in Clan Wars(Mana Wars etc.). For example Little leagues(1-25 lvl), Amateur League(25-45 lvl) and Pro League(45-60 lvl). After adding lvl 70 it may be changed to 1-30, 30-50 and 60-70.<br>I used those numbers because original league system is quite unbalanced in my opinion.</p><p>3.Prizes should be divided in 2 groups.</p><p>First groups is prizes in each league where ranking is based on clan own position. Prizes in that group should be like 1 napo to top 5 clans in Pro league and 1 napo to 1-2 clans in Amateur league plus smaller prizes based on league(DT+TN in Pro, TN in Amateur and Gold/TN in Little).</p><p>Second group is prizes to alliances. Those prizes should be greater. For example 2-3 napos to top 3, 1-2 napos to top 10 and 1 napo to top 20. <br>As additional prizes dinoz eggs or other usefull items(dinoz remodeling or ability to convertate N gold to TN like in master pack, Tickets to different grids etc.) may be given.</p><p>4.Alliances should be limited. For example in each Alliance may be only one clan in Pro League, one-two clans in Amateur League and 2-3 clans in Little League. Points may be calculated as 1.0 to Pro league clans, 0.75 to Amateur league clans and 0.5 to Little league Clans. So alliance from 3 Little league clans may get more points in Alliance Rankings then alone Pro clan.</p><p>Firstly it will force bigger clans to make alliances with smaller clans. This will particularly solve forum problems because most of active players from smaller clans woulf be able to ask veterans some questions on Alliance forum.</p><p>Secondly it will let newbies to get almost as much napos as top players (difference would be 1 napo rewarded to Pro and Amateur leagues). Also Pro clans will become more elite because of fewer free space so it will be worthless to accept weak players into them. At the same time it will make Amateur and Little clans to be much more viable choices.</p><p>5.How the system will work during Clan Wars.</p><p>A) Little(and Amateur) league clans would be able to ask their ally clans from little, amateur and pro leagues for a help in cost of some points awarded for the win. <br>BUT(it's most important thing here), those Pro and Amateur players would be able to use only dinoz that fit Little league and wouldn't be able to defend allies castle. Cost of ally involving should be higher depending on league of ally(higher from Little to Pro), but not TOO high to make it still worthy. <br>Players from any league can involve allies only from equal or higher leagues (it means Pro clan can't involve allies).<br>Both atacking and defending clan can involve allies.</p><p>B)Clans from each league can declare a war only to clans from the same league.<br>War can't be declared to a clan which is already in war with other Clan. But even during the War clan can help his allies if they ask(asking should be an in-game decision, like a button "ask ally for a help"). So it is impossible to declar a war to several clans, but possible to accept some requests of allies plus declaring one war(or defending from one enemy).</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Also it may be an option to declar Huge War to the whole Alliance in much higher cost but with all the dinoz involved. Then you will need to atack not Clan Castle but Alliance Castle with more hp(I think double or even triple) and maybe some improved defence. Also all ally clans can defend Alliance Castle with all their dinoz without any restriction. Clans losing Alliance war won't be able to declar wars during the whole next day. It may be an option to make declaring Alliance war possible when both Alliances agreed to prevent bullying from Stronger Alliances. Also I think Alliance Wars between to Clans should be possible only one time during the whole Clan War. But it should be an option of revenge while the clan-winner can't refuse. So the maximum number between two clans is actually 2. Of course after second lose it will be another day of Peace(unable to declare the war) to losing clan so it prevent silly moves.<br>Huge war can't be declared while one of a clans is in war with different clan.(For example two alliances want to organise a Huge war, but one of a clans is in war with clan from third Alliance).<br></span></p><p>C)Players from clans inside one Alliance should be able to freely change clans during the whole war in cost of 1000 gold, but won't be able to change Alliance during the war(they may quit it but won't be able to join it or any other Alliance again). Also they can't be dismissed from clan until war is over. Insted they may be banned temporarily by their clan leader, so all their dinoz can't participate in war(to prevent breaking defence combination by inactive players etc.). Between clan events swapping clans and alliances is free(but still cost 1000 gold).<br>It will make some strategic maneuvrs possible but prevent abusing.<br>In addition, players who wasn't part of the clan when the war started should be able to join any clan they want until the war is nearly ended.</p><p>D)What about prizes, I had an idea to make the whole prize on the clan instead of priize to each player depending on number of players. But it also should be a minimal prize to each player which is half of usual prize. It will make possible awarding players who participated the most and lowering prize to those who did nothing. Of cource, players who don't like this may create their own clan and make more democratic rules.</p><p>E)In addition to point D it may be a clan ranking system when up to 10 members are equal to clan leader and they will decide how to share prizes. Let's call them Lords but each clan may call them as they want(like original status system). They will all be elected by clan leader but after that their votes are equal to leaders votes. It will help to make decisions and improve their status but won't make them much more rights than usual clan administrators(just prestigious status inside clan and maybe twinoid icon).</p><p>F)The last but not least, what about how Alliances created. There should be a leading clan who will be able to start Alliance wars and to invite new clans to Alliance. That's why "bigger" Alliances may absorb "little" alliances(for example Alliance from 1 Pro clan may absorb Alliance from 2 Amateur and 3 Little clans even though last is bigger in number). Also decisions about joining alliances, sending invitation or dismissing clan should be accepted by ALL clan leaders or Lords(point E) (one vote from each clan needed, it means that even 1 lord can accept the decision). Clans can't be dismissed from alliance during the war, so you should chose wisely who you will invite in your alliance. Leader clan can't be dismissed.</p><p>If all the clans will originally be part of the same alliance(just after the system launch), for example Rakshasa will originally be part of Alliance called Rakshasa etc., such mechanic of joining Alliances will make linking all the clans to global Alliance ranking significally easier. So each clan will automatically be a part of Alliance and if Leader clan leaves alliance it should firstly chose a new leader so the name of alliance will automatically change. And immediately after leaving this clan will join newly created alliance with the same name as this clan.</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Also at the beginning of the war Leading clans of alliances fully filled with clans may change the name of alliance and after the war those alliances will get special golden status and may be saved in Hall of Fame if they do well. But it is not important and don't have too much sence, only forcing people to create full alliances.<br></span></p><p>G)Also it may be a good idea to change cost of creating new clan to 50000 to make it worthy to join other clans instead of creating own(it will help to improve more clans especially in Little league). Joining an alliance may also be paid from clans treasury(for example 10000 cooins). But it may be accepted only after leading clan of alliance you want to join sent you invitation.</p><br><p>In conclusion I need to say that this idea is totally raw and need a lot of improvement(it came to my had just after I read some posts from community grows thread, all ideas I invented today in a few hours, so I never saw how they work). But that's why I posted it here(if it was perfect and totally done I would immediately sent it to Epoq). I hope for your feedback and maybe one day it will appear on our or even on other servers.</p>

                <p>Epoq suggested the clan members decrease one year and a half ago. It was massively rejected. Perhaps opinion changed, but some people may stay firm in their own decisions.</p><p>If 60 pvp active clans with 50 active members each with homogeneous levels, if you put the clan decrease to 30, it will mean 100 clans. But not all clans have 50 members, a part of them are a bit inactive or not pvp players. And some clans have different levels in their players in, ranging from small to big. Roughly you will get less than 15 new clans...</p><p>The whole purpose of wars have always been the possibility to freely play with all your dinozs against any kind of opponent. If you really want to be shackled by leagues, go in CotC and don't make wars more boring.</p><br><p>At last, as a Rakshasa member myself: No to Alliances! Kill them All!!!</p>

                <p>Hmm, but the idea of Alliances is the same as idea of clans. I plan it as permanent connections and it will be actually a Huge clans with it's own forums and leader. Actually only that will change to every single member is position in league ranking. They will actually be a part of not smaller but bigger clan.<br>Maybe I wrong somewhere, but it looks quite epic and awsome, to be part of such a huge connection.</p><p>The main idea is to force top player communicate with newbies to improve their ranking in clan ladder. If you have full clan of 50 members and all of them has strong 50+ dinoz(I think even in Rakshasa not every member has good lvl 50+ top 3), you can just create 2 alliances and compete each other during clan wars(LOTS of players complained that it's too boring when there are only one clan w/o any worthy rivals(I mean Rakshasa)). That's why decreasing clan size will make at least some more Top clans with more even power. Also Alliance system I described will help low lvl players to compete with top players for great rewards. And top players will get their reward anyway if they will act right.<br>Also, particularly my idea was based on topic Mengo just linked, but I slightly improved this idea and added some little changes. And as I see, most votes are for decreasing clan size. I just explained how MT can try to satisfy everyone(even people who dislike lowering clan size).</p>

                <p>Err... where did you read the worthy rivals thing?</p><p>Well, we're fine having small players in Rakshasa since they contribute to clan life. And they were there since the beginning of our clan, when we were only 26 members winning the first Mana War... so not really, the last 15 recruits are approximatively the same, a bigger part being smaller than mid than big.

                <p>My clan is exactly. But we have only 20-30 members with high level dinoz as most clans have. Also we have wings clans as most clans have. That's why idea of Alliances will not bring those family-like relationships in any way if you've read my post. You will still have all your members inside one Alliance but every player will have their use no matter what level of dinoz they have. And you will be able to Alliance with your wings and have even bigger community. Alliance forum will help to do this.</p><p>Also you may use you mibbit chat etc for your alliance needs. Actually this may negatively affect only clans which have more than 30 players with very strong dinoz. When the number of high level masters increases clan sizes may be set to 40 and even to 50 again.</p><p>Now it's needed to share such strong players between some top clans and those top clans will in some way give protection to smaller clans, so most smaller clans will make their goal to join strong alliance and do their best to fit in them.</p><p>Maybe it would be a good idea to make all around server poll and not just mibbit chat(like was with some IDT).</p><p>I say that because we also have very friendly community inside our clan and I would never be glad to separate it or any other community. But we have a lot of players who have dinoz which can't compete with higher level dinoz yet and they don't have any fun during Clan Wars(maybe some fun during CotC).</p><p>This change will help every player be usefull(maybe MT should add 4 leagues instead of 3, 1-25, 25-40, 40-55 and 55-70, after adding lvl 70 so any dinoz will be useful). And it won't separate friendly communities in any way. Even if clan has full 50 players which all has very strong 50+ lvl dinoz(I don't know such a clans), they may make 2 Alliances and have fun during the wars together, sharing 1st and 2nd spots in a way of Huge War(which should be very funny because actually it's a war between two clans of up to 180 members). Also members can freeky swap clans inside alliance so you want have any problems with going to little league clan and having fun with low level dinoz.</p><p>As I already said, the main goal of this system is not to separate communities but make smaller clans more competitive and give them a way to get napos and challenge higher level players.</p>

                <p>What about worthy rivals thing, as I remember it was a huge discussion during the last championship when semi-finalists GC not even tried to challange finalists because they knew they have very little chances. Alliance system will particularly prevent this(because little league clans will also affect ranking of pro league clans). So it would be two ways to win: Be the best in Pro league or train your newbies and be the best in Amateur and Little leagues while performing well in pro.</p>

                <p>Just quote that one part and leave out everything else that was said back then, if it is convenient for your case.

I think clan size is fine as it is. Wing Clans have already been tried and are now a thing of the past. Real problem is that the top players all gather in one clan. So if your clan size would be 30, you won't see those top players scatter among the already existing clans and make way for a more level board, you would see new clans, filled with just top players , clans that we can't hope to win against.</p><p>So it would be the same old, only that instead of 3 unbeatable clans, there would be 6 and you now other clans couldn't even compete for top10, 20 and so on and will fall out of nappo prize range. Some might then loose interest in the game and we are left with even less players.</p>

This statement wasn't made before the final started. This statement was made after the match didn't start properly and made me and my clan reconsider if its worth to wait (an unknown additional amount of x-days). The answer is what you quoted. Examples for other internal affairs you (cant) have no clue of but which affect the decision:<br>-Negotiations with Rak<br>-Activity level during an future rematch/vacations</p><p>So claiming that we would not have tried to face rak is plain wrong, there is more to that statement which you missed.</p><p>Anyways, so much for clarification, its not a big deal, since your initial statement about the gap in power is still correct. Yet your example wasn't very well chosen (neither GC nor Rak are good examples. We are your average top 10 clan, Rak is above everyone), even though our chances would have been small nonetheless, but thats a giving ^^</p>

                <p>Sorry if I said something wrong, I didn't want to say that GC was feared to fight Rakshasa, I just posted this quote to prove that even 2nd place considered their chances to win quite low(and it only says about unbalanced clan system, nothing else).</p><p>When there are just one clan that dominates in Pro League, it's not interesting to watch their fights at all. But if there will be 6 "unbeatable clans" as you said, they all will be in Pro League, but there will be 3 more leaguse with almost even chances to get first prize(2 clans from Amateur league or 3 clans from Little league MAY bring more points to Alliance ranking than 1 clan from Pro league. Also in most top 10 clans there are at least 20 players who can compete with those top 1-5 players. The only weak spot is that those 20 players are not enough to compete with 40-50 top 1-5 players.</p><p>And if clan system will be reformed, part of those top clans will join other top clans(with lower number of players) and part will join amateur and little league clans in their alliance(if their dinoz fit those leagues or they just want to have some fun).</p><p>I said already a couple of times, that there should be alliance prize system, so the main prizes will be given to all the clans of an alliance, and different would be only bonus prizes for league places. This new system will make possible awarding of up to 120 clans(which makes sense to every clan to participate in war, because at least they will get minimal prize if they will do well in their league).</p><p>That's why this change won't break the interest to the war of little clans in any way but will strongly increase this interest. Especially it will be good because everyone will get the prize based on his own performance and not the performance of clan "tops". So every player can become "top" in his own league(players who can't level up high level dinoz would be able to train special low level dinoz trained to fight in Little or Amateur leagues and have fun now instead of wating for greater future. I know what I was talking about because first few wars I was just a player who gets free napos thanks to my clanmates. But that was not because I was inactive player or had wrongly levelupped dinoz. That was because my dinoz was too low on level. New system will make every master involved. So everyone will have fun and take part in the whole alliance vicotry.</p><p>Those new alliances are actually an improved clans with even bigger amount of players, but with more complex structure(actually it will be maximum number of pro players in each clan and minimum number of amateur and little players as well). And all of those players will get almost the same reward.</p><p>So alliance which has quite strong clans in all 3 leagues can get the 1st place in alliance rankings(where main prizes are awarded), even though it got for example 6th place in Pro ranking(where only bonus prizes are awardes). And clan from pro leagues that has weaker allies from amateur and little leagues may get the first place in pro ranking(and it's 1-2 napos as a bonus prize), while getting 15th position in alliance rankings and only 1 napo as main prize.</p><p>It will work in sugh way that everyone who acted well will get their reward regardless of their allies performance. But maximum results may be reached only with perfect coopertion of all the members of alliance.</p><p>This is very complex system, but I still can't find any group of players who won't be satisfied with it. That's why I hope it worth being brought up to this server and maybe all other servers. Also it will push dinorpg closer to other cybersport games in some way. Because chances to win would become more even to all the players, and paying players would get big but not unreachable advantage: only alliances with top players inside would be able to compete for first places but at the same time clans wich cooperate with them will also get those chances.</p><p>This game has a great potential on my opinion(one of the best games i've for players who don't want to play original MMO games but want to just have a little fun during work and sometimes take part in global events, at the same time communicating with different people) and it may grow much larger than it is(it only needs a bit of reorganisation and maybe some advertisement).</p><p>P.S. Sure, this system still needs a lot of improvements(maybe adding complex points calculation system based on number of clans in alliance).<br>I mean for example full alliance will get 1+0.75*2+0.5*3=4 points of maximum score. And alliance from one pro clan will get 2 points of maximum score(means their score will be multipled by 2), one amateur clan will get 1 point and one little clan will get 0.8. It will make creating alliances of 1 clan still viable choice, if you can't find strong clans to cooperae with. But it should work in such way that alliance fully filled with clans may get maximum possible points if all the clans will act well, but will get less coins if one or two clans will act bad. It needs some work to figure out final numbers, but I will be glad to work on it if that idea would be accepted(or at least help with this work).</p>

                <p>I think if the whole server will support this idea it may have a big success and I think it may make admins interested(since it will work on other servers just as good as on English server).</p><p>The main idea of this discussion is sharing interest for this topic and improving this system with changes based on negative opinions(I still don't see any cons neither for community neither for MT except of hard coding).</p><p>Also I don't think codding of this system will be harder then codding championship. MT decided to add championships, so why not to add one more big update. If MT admins will be interested in this idea, why not to bring it in live? But to make them interested players should support it.</p><p>If MT will understand that this will greatly improve interest to the game from little league players, which may inspire them to donate here some money they may also support it. And having balanced PvP system may also bring a lot of new players into the game.</p><p>In addition I already wrote most of the main rules of new system, and I hope that community will help to improve it even more(add some important rules I forgot and fix possible mistakes). So only thing MT need to do is coding it(code will be very similar to original war code, so war code core may be used for this system with just a few addings, like alliance forum, and changes, like 2 league systems).</p><p>Most big projects in gaming world have an advanced feedback system, so if MT want DinoRPG to become a big project (I'm sure it has a huge potential to become such a project), they should work on improving that unbalanced PvP system(Wars and maybe Chamionships, adding some new kinds of events). Balance is quite nice now, even though few little fixes still needed. Balanced global PvP system may involve a lot of new players to the game(because Dinorpg is actually the only project of such type and adding unique PvP system may win a lot of new fans to it).</p>

                <p>P.S. Instead of telling me why MT won't appreciate this system, tell me please why it can be bad for MT or for community so I will be able to improve with your help it in such way, that MT would accept it and bring it on live maybe not in nearest time but in a few years.</p><p>It may be the global project of our server so I ask every player of our server to bring here their ideas about evolving war system. Soon it can become really global project and it is a real chance to improve system that so much people complaint about instead of just sitting and doing nothing like we usually do. If all of you are totally satisfied with today state of War System, then why there are so much complaints on forums about it?</p><p>Also you said CotC is enough for league system. But league system in CotC is used in wrong way, it doesn't provide little league clans with napos and those little league members are ones who need those napos the most (tops with 40+ napos have already more than enough, and newbie members with their 1-2 napos just don't have any encouragement to evovle and donate money). Being part of huge communities will help them to learn more about the game and become more interested in paying money.</p>

                <p>I talking about that only because I became interested in paying money only few time ago after some wins in Clan events(after winning in amateur league CotC together with my clan.

But I began planning to start regular donations after joining university only after I participated in clan event by myself and won victory together with my teammates.</p><p>Little victories inspire people much more than new content. That's why this change will make possible those little victories for up to 60 little league and up to 40 amateur league clans in total. At the end most of active clans that already exist will get at least small reward for their work, while now most of clans get nothing and stop participating in clan events. Those newbie players will get the chance to participate in little victories of their alliance by themselves and nothing will better inspire them to evolve their accounts.</p>

                <p>Thanks for an advice, but I never got my hopes too highs and I had some fun while just creating this system. Also it's just a game so I won't be very sad if my idea won't work. Instead I will be really happy if it will.</p>
