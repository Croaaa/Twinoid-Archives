                Idea (numbers dont need to be exact and should just give a rough impression), if you only want to know what the basic advantages and disadvantages of the system are, skip to "PROS:":<br><br><br><strong>REGISTRATION</strong><br>- Groups of 10-25 players can form <strong>teams</strong> which can, once found, fight cotc-like battles in a ranked system (I'm sure this was suggested already in the forums in different topic). Players can be from one clan (sure is easier for them to find each other together to a team), but don't have to (a subforum / area in the forum to find other players willing to form a team would be a nice addition, if this system was about to be introduced).<br><br>To make it more interesting, it would be good, if all "teams" would be of similar strength (we don't want cotc-battles that are unfair from start by levels). So we create narrow leagues and use the power points we just grew to know from the currently running 2nd CotC:<br><br>for example:<br>highlevelleague: the targetted ranking could be something like:<br><cite> (mean power level of a dino at lvl 40)*60 </cite>(45 dinos on field and 15 dinos for reinforcements). One team isn't allowed to be stronger OR weaker than a specified (small) interval around that power sum. So for example if the power sum from this above equation would be 20000, teams registered for this league could only participate, if their strength is between 18000 and 22000 power points, if we use a +-10% margin. Ofc it can also be even more narrow, or wider at the bottom limit, but that needs to be tested out.<br><br>Another league could aim at lvl 30 as mean level (or lower if needed, but I dont think so) and enable the majority of players to be able to participate in one of those leagues.<br><br><br><strong>COTC-MECHANISMS</strong><br><u>Ranking:</u><br>The Teams' success needs to be evaluated.<br>I suggest using the Glicko-System (wiki/google it, if you don't know it, since links aren't allowed) to calculate the team strenght. <br>The basic principle behind this: <br>Your teams strength develops by fighting cotc-battles vs other teams. Being successful gains your team points, losing a battle will lower your points. The amout of points you gain or lose after a battle depends on the (glicko-)ranking of the enemy team and your own team. So beating the same (bad) team over and over again won't grant you first place, but beating very strong opponents will (and being strong will mostly mean good teamplay &amp; coordination, if you read further, not having dino advantage).<br><br><u>Matchmaking / Chosing Fight</u><br>We know the problems that different time zones bring to the players of the international dinoRPG-version in events like the CotC. The worst we see now in the speedy cotc version. So I thought about a way to avoid this problem.<br><br>Certainly the best approach would be: being able to chose the time. Being able to chose the time can also be a pro in terms of speed. If you can choose the time, you and your time might be able to actually do the cotc-battle in a manner of some hours. Let me explain:<br><br><cite>(<em>this is only an idea, ofc using the traditional 1 AP / hour would work as well!</em>)<br>Lets say both teams can agree on a battle starting at 7 pm. Then that would mean most people in the team are able to fight at that time, so AP can be given in shorter time with no shortcoming on one of the two teams. To start it even more swiftly every dinos put on the field at most 60 mins after the battle started gets a boost of 10 AP for initial positioning (and shortening the starting phase which is basically boring, because no fights are possible) and no dino gets additional AP in this hour, giving time to the teams to evaluate the battle grounds and decide on tactics/positioning. After the 60 mins are over no AP boost will be granted to newly joining dinos and every dinos on the field starts to gain AP every 3 mins and the battle will end after about 4 hours. This gives every dino 80 turns + 10 at the start = 90 = nearly current system. If AP every 3 mins is too short the battle could also be done like this: AP every 10 mins, the battle will last 4 hours (after that it is stopped and AP won't be gained the next hours) and then 5 hours the the following days starting at the time. So basically your clan will only need to fight the cotc from 19:00 - 24:00 each day, erasing the need to stay online at night and bad surprises after waking up.<br><br>If the leaders of the clans can't agree to this mode the normal mode (something like 1 AP / hour, no initial AP-boost) will be played like we know it from the first cotc, starting at a random time (or, if the leaders can agree on a time, the chosen day time). So in the worst case your are left with a battle like now, where the starting date either fits your clans preferences or not, or you can have the advantage to play at a time, that works better for you (actually I would love fights that are only happening at 19:00 - 24:00 when most of the guys I know can be online, if we are playing vs other teams from europe ^^).<br></cite><br><br>Teams can <strong>challenge</strong> other clans, each battle "round" (just like the current battle rounds) offers 2 possible starting days (for example would be possible to start from wednesday or thursday), starting time is completely up to the team leaders or can be set to random, if the team leaders can't agree on a time. Also the mode can be chosen (the speedmode with 10 AP initial boost and fast AP gain OR the traditional mode (default if the team leaders cant agree on the speed mode)). If one team doesn't challenge a team (or the teams it challenged dont want to play vs it or already accepted another challenge) the system selects an opponent automatically, choosing the team nearest to your ranking. There could be 7 battles just like now. Opponents for Round 6 and 7 will be matched with help of the glicko ranking to enforce some decisions (and we will also have a finale).<br><br>Draws will be +-0 points for both teams, same for the 1 team that doesnt get a a matchup, if an uneven number of teams participes.<br><br>Like this we would stay at 7 matches, lenght a bit longer than the first cotc to allow more destinctive planning on the cotc starting times. I am not sure if 7 matches are enough to fully play out the advantages of the glicko-system, but it should be better than awarding +1 or -1 regardless on which opponent you fight. <cite>Ofc this whole system I suggest here could also work as a long term league mode, where teams have 3 months and larger numbers of available challenges to carry out.<br>Pro: rankings get more meaningful <br>Con: more "work" but mby also more fun, as long as the clans are of similar strength (should be like that because of the conditions)</cite><br><br><br><strong>PRICES:</strong><br>Obvioulsy the topteams in the glicko-ranking will get rewards and as always they need to be adjusted to the number of teams participating. Similar to a system counting wins, but more accurate.<br><br><strong>PROS:</strong><br>- every team will have a similar strength by power level conditions to join the league<br>- some chosen fights, where you can even challenge your allied clans for fun if you want and possibly at the daytime you want<br>- widely established ranking system to evaluate the team strength, even for low numbers of fights<br><br><br><br><strong>FLAWS:</strong><br>- The worse the power level calculation fits to the current games balance, the bigger the strength differences of different teams can get and the ranking will get influenced more by dino strength then by playing (but on the other hand currently that is even more the case)<br>- don't know the influence of challenge choices in respect to the ranking (you cant reach top place if you only chose weak teams, even if you win everything, but on the other hand, it will also be your own fault, if you do that)<br>- challenging needs extra time for planning the start / communication between the team leaders

                hmm did someone even bother to read this ? <br><br>Imho its a great idea. The team-principe has been suggested multiple times, and all else i can say is that the elo-system really works. Only that occured withit in other games is that you could "smurf" somebody, meaning that you pretend to be weak, lower your ranking, and than crush stronger opponents who feel to safe. But this wouldnt make any sense here because no ones anonymous and you want to be rewarded, so you want to climb as high as possible in the ladder.<br><br>Best thing is, that every member of eachs clan can participate... the stronger members form a lvl 40 team, the not so strong members form a lvl 25 team, and so on...

If this were implented then the gap for finishing time for the battles would be quite large too.  I feel like the CoTC wouldn't be as intensive as it should be.  <br><br>Not to mention a lot of battles would be needed for this to work properly, and with finishing time gaps so wide due to different starting times and AP times, this would be a very, very long CoTC.  If there was no designated battle field (you can enter field as long as you "register" your dinoz or w/e), then that would be fine.<br><br>I feel like there's too much effort and luck involved in the challenging.  If your challenge gets refused, you get paired with clan nearest to your ranking, which could be a few ranks up, which for maybe rank 5, would be the most likely case, as well as the worst.<br><br>I do like a lot aspects of this though.  The teams are very intruiging.  They would be very fair and like Pigov said, everyone can participate <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif">  <br><br>I also think the AP boost for getting there early is a good idea too, more incentive to get there ASAP!<br><br>I can only imagine how hard this would be for the programmers/devs to do this though. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br>Swiss system would be much easier.

                It would even be possible to raise the dinos number on field per player to 4 or 5, so that less players are needed per team.<br><br>@ROBlNHOOD:<br>Thank you for your comment.<br>1 extra day for variable schedule would mean 1 extra day each battle = 7 days for a cotc with 7 battles, 1 week longer - it is not that much imo, especially since the time for fighting doesn't increase (inbetween the fights you can just chill out longer).<br>The organisation isn't harder than it currently is - you gather a team, you register dinos, after registration time is over the battles start. The only thing that needs more attention is the power level your team reaches, since in the end it needs to be in a specified region. Once the maximum points are reached, you can still register dinos for your team, but they can't be used in the championship. The team leader (and co-leader) would have the right to switch the registered dinos / chose which ones will be taken, so basically the only ones with a bit extra work will be the teamleaders, which need to select the final dinos lineup, challenge other clans (optional, no need to do it if you dont want to) and if you challenge - decide on a mode and time to play (also optional, if you dont decide anything the start will be random as described); for everyone else the work load stays the same. Note: you may challenge more than 1 clan simultaneously, the first one to accept will fight you (hey, you can PM team leaders, mby from your time zone, and I am sure they will like to play vs you at a convenient time than vs a random team at a random time).<br><br><cite>If your challenge gets refused, you get paired with clan nearest to your ranking, which could be a few ranks up, which for maybe rank 5</cite>Thats a problem with the current system - since all clans have different strengths and there is no open end but a defined top - those directly (or some places) below the top clan will suffer by unfair matchups if compared to clans that are in the middle of the rankings.<br>The system I proposed would basically mean, that the top ranked players only play better / react better to battle situations. Their dino strength will be very similar to yours. Ofc to ensure that it would be needed to disable leveling for the cotc duration - but hey, if your dinos fight in dinoland, they probably won't gain a level anyway. Ofc I see that paying players could complain, that they don't have clear advantages over non-paying players, since they can't make use of their level-advantage, since they can't exceed the power level limit. But on the other hand I think that is,  what we have the wars for - thats a battle of ressources. The CotC can be the battle of coordination and reaction and good team setups.

                Let's take MK and Cookies for an example... No one would want to accept a challenge from them except for CnD, LOoT, and BBC.  Because no one would want to fight them, they would be almost guarenteed to lose at least 2-3 fights already agains the top 3 or 4 clans.

                As things are powerlevels and meeting as many enemies of same strength can only work, when the powerpoints are limited to a certain range of points, for example all teams would need to have 18000-22000 k points. We all can agree, tha a wellplayed 18000 team can win vs a 22000 team (although probably all teams would fill in as near to the maximum as they could, so even the lowest teams would probably be higher than 19000). This way the main the team with the highest ranking still could lose vs the team on place 7 (what wasn't possible in this cotc).<br>Ofc we only need such limitations, if we want some <strong>similar</strong> fights. If everyone wants easy opponents, then please completely remove the powersystem and do a traditional league system, but it will be boring, I promise (most fights won't be fought, but forfeited from one or the other side -&gt; boring).<br><br>About the glicko system - if it doesnt work well for 7-8 fights (in league mode it certainly would be NP), then ofc it can be swapped with a +1 +0 - system like now. I wouldn't remove the challenging for simplicity (because challenging brings certain advantages like making it easier to find an opponent, that agrees on your starting time and mode plans), but I would limit the maximum number one clan can challenge a specific other clan to only one time, so it wouldn't be possible to abuse it (else one team of inactive members could feed a friendly team 7 or 8 wins (or to make it less obvious at least something like 3-4 wins)).
