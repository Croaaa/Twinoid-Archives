                Tuesday, January 5th, 2010<br><br>I was awaken by Tora. She's licking my hand. My head dizzy. I couldn't even move my hand. I felt no strength at all like i have never use this body...<br>After awhile, i think, my body regained control little by little. Then i started remember what happened. It was ... a strang space hole! Yes, ... i and Tora was traveling together to Grandpa Joe's home. We heard some strange noise in the middle forest and we came close to it. Before recognizing it, we was pulled into a whirling circle... well, and i found myself here.<br>I checked myself if something was missing. Hmm... everything seems fine. No loss. All is settled up! We continued our way to Grandpa Joe's home. It's not far from us.<br><br>At Grandpa Joe's home,<br>I entered and said hello. Grandpa Joe look older than the last week meeting. May be he worried about something. Unexpected, he gave us a really warm welcome with a tight hug. I was so surprised! Then he asked me where i have been for some long. He thought i failed in mission. He showed me the calendar. I couldn't believe in my eyes. It was a year pass! Oh my god, i was shocked!<br>Taking a face-wash and a big water cup, i asked himi about things happened. Arcording to Grandpa Joe, it must be a time hole. We was taken to ... recent time. ^^ Sound crazy to me! ... anyways, i decided to continue our path. May be i'm still young, inexperienced and weak but it can't stop me. I want to know how the world when i wasn't around. hehe... i got another mission from Grandpa Joe and headed out. To the Fountain of Youth!<br><br>Tora encountered 1 Gluon. <em>(Exactly what i'm searching!)</em><br>Tora defeated it and continued.<br>Lost 3 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_life_en.gif"><br>Gained 7 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_xp.gif"> and 1696 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> <em>(Let's party! Woohoo)</em><br><br><strong>Tora leveled up!</strong><br>Tora is level 9 now.<br>Tora gained 1 Wood power and learned the skill Sympathetic.<br><br>We arrived the Fountain of Youth. My mission was killing a Gluon. Hey, it's finished! ^^ Tomorrow i and Tora will visit Grandpa Joe again. He would happy! heheh... by the way, i wanted to recruit new member to our team. I discussed this with Tora and she happily agreed.<br><br>We went to Dino Enclosure. There're so many nice Dinos. Which kind was i looking for? Just random choice, i think. I didn't know which i should recruit. I only got a small amount of gold. Then a red guy caught my eyes. He is a Sirain. He was flirting a female Sirain when i stopped by. I guess i disturbed them. That guy said something to the girl and... be kicked at the.. middle! Wow, it must be hurt. I don't know if it's love action of Sirain or not but i hope i won't get it. ^^ heheh... after that, i and Tora came close and offered the recruitment. He accepted immediately. Another surprise of the day! ^^ We came back to the inn and rest. Oh, his name is Carbuncle. I guess it means a gem, not.. something else. heheh...

                Wednesday, January 6th, 2010<br><br>New day came upon us. I was awaken by the door knock sound. The room service brought breakfast and a letter. The service of this inn was great! I didn't know they prepare breakfast for customer. Another inn doesn't do that. I enjoyed the breakfast with Tora and new guy Carbuncle while opening the letter. I could not keep myself from shout out loud: "OH MY GOD! A FAN MAIL!!". He noticed my journal vol. 2. It's so great to know someone still remember my journal even i was... away for a long time. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/love.gif"> My heart beat rate was raised to 200. hahah... i didn't know how to thank Fangstriker.<br>I asked some people at the lounge about Fangstriker. He is not very famous, i guess. When i asked the bartender, i knew i asked the right person. hehe... he told me some. Fangstriker has a Sirain named Fricaya. Fangstriker is in clan Mystery of Angels. What a nice clan name! ^^ His dino is tough, level 15. I wish he could teach Tora and Carb (Carbuncle for short) some moves!<br><br>Time waits for no one. We gotta back to Grandpa Joe's to bring good news.<br><br>Tora, Carb encountered 1 Wolf and 1 Smashroom. <em>(Look at Carb's kick! So cute! ^^)</em><br>Tora, Carb defeated them and continued.<br>Lost 0 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_life_en.gif"><br>Gained 19 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_xp.gif"> and 299 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> <em>(Teamwork is best! Yay! No one get hurt.. except the enemies!)</em><br><br>We arrived the Grandpa Joe's home without any risk. I introduced Carb to Grandpa Joe. He looked at Carb then... give him some gold to buy candy. I thought Carb would get mad because be treated like a child. Well, but Carb smiled back. ^^ Then i gave Grandpa Joe the finished mission.<br><br><strong>Reward</strong>: 30 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_xp.gif"> and 500 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"><br><br>Grandpa Joe told us that Tora have done all mission avaiable for now. A bit sad and very happy that Tora did a great job! Then i took a mission for Carb. This time, the mission is Fresh Fish. Carb looked at me with strong eyes. I knew this is an easy task for Carb. We said goodbye Grandpa Joe and went outside to set a tent.

                Wednesday, January 6th, 2010<br><br>We woke up earlier and started travel to Frish Port. The next destination was BrutForce town.<br><br>Tora, Carb encountered 1 Wolf and 2 Smashroom. <em>(Carb go first!)</em><br>Tora, Carb defeated them and continued.<br>Lost 13 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_life_en.gif"><br>Gained 27 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_xp.gif"> and 1336 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> (<em>Wow, great job, guys!)</em><br><br>We arrived at the BrutForce. Long time no see big town. May be next time, i will visit University. There should something new! ^^<br><br>While i was passing through BrutForce, i came across a woman. She waved and called me over to her.<br><br>"Why, there you are the young Dinoz Master I've been hearing so much about. It seems that Grandpa Joe has been talking about you, saying that you're handling his missions quite well.", she said. I kept quiet and listening to her. She continued, "As you seem to be someone we can count on, I'd also like to trust you with a few missions. Of course, you are free to accept, or not!"<br><br>She looked danity in that half mask. Well, she said she trusts me but i didn't really know her. So i asked, "But who are you?"<br><br>"Who am I?!?! Ah, tsk-tsk! I'm sorry, my young friend. I have neglected my manners and failed to introduce myself. I am...   ...", she answered.<br><br>I insquired, "You are?"<br><br>She apologized, "Well, I can't say. I really do apologize. It's just that   if the wrong people knew that you know who I am, it could get you in trouble! But I want you to know you can trust me, so I will reveal something interesting to you." Eventually, i said "Ahhh..." mindlessly.<br><br>Then she continued, "Let's see... I suppose that, to this point, you have learned that each skill corresponds to a unique element, one of five possible elements. For example, Wrath corresponds to the Fire element and Perception to the Water element. But... that's not everything! Some skills exist that are linked to not just one  but two elements! They are called the double-skills. A double-skill can be learned from either of the two elements that it is part of, but needs knowledge of specific skills from each element."<br><br>I expressed a really-surprised face. She smiled, "I understand your surprise. It's a well-guarded secret. However, to be able to learn these skills you must first master the Double-Skill. It's a secret skill that on the Drag...  but I have already said too much!"<br><br>I was so curious and asked her to tell me more. hehehe... pour her ears with some sweet words. Finally, she agreed, "Oh it's easy, look, you only need to do "this" and.... *ouch*. She pinched me!<br><br>"No ... it's not working ... if it peaks when I'm doing "that" or if your Dinoz hasn't learned the skills allowing you to master the Double-Skill, it won't work. Come back later to try again!", she giggled and ran away. Is that a trick !? I was standing and... looked at her shadow. She's fast, i have to admit!<br><br>We went around BrutForce and guess what, i found her again. Let's call her ... Madam X! Sound great, huh? heheh... mysterious! Hmm... this time, i didn't let her go until ...i got a mission from her. ^^ After all, i like mysterious woman and secret missions.<br><br>"A ship arrived last night at the Frish Port. It dropped off a black briefcase for me. Can you bring it to me? Don't open it!", she said quickly and disappeared as soon as i nodded.<br><br>Tora and Carbuncle now had same destination. Glad that they didn't have to seperate. We booked a room in town inn and rested.

                Thursday, January 7th, 2010<br><br>"Good day, guys!", i talked to Tora and Carbuncle as i woke up. They were looking at the crowded street in front of the inn. I went to bathroom and saw a poster. These days, people can see poster everywhere, even in bathroom. The poster reads something fun is going on at the Market Place. I didn't remember when is the last time i visit the market. So i brought it to discuss with my dinos. Well, it seems they were wanting to go there too. Quickly, we got out of the inn and head to the Market Place.<br><br>Tora, Carb encountered 1 Wolf and 1 Smashroom. <em>(No comment! heheh)</em><br>Tora, Carb defeated them and continued.<br>Lost 6 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_life_en.gif"><br>Gained 19 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_xp.gif"> and 413 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> <em>(Too easy, huh? Let's keep going, guys.)</em><br><br>We could hear the noise from afar. Marketplace, here we are! haha... i ran toward and then... be left behind by my dinos. They're so fast! ^^ In a moment, i realized that Tora is bigger than before. She's growing up. I didn't notice 'cause she's by myside all the time. I didn't look at her much, just hold her neck. She love be tickled her neck. Her fur is really soft. heheh... oh, i wondered how old is Carbuncle? Tora is 4 years old. To her race, she's a teenager. I will ask Carbuncle.<br><br>First place we visited was Tamer Market. It is the place where you can buy and sell Dinoz, ingredients, and some rare items coming from all over Dinoland. The currency used here is Treasure Note <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_tix.gif"> which you can obtain in Dinoland Bank. Hmm, i was just looking around. I don't have any Treasure Notes.<br><br>I saw a shady man standing next to a stall. He look... suspicious! I approached him. Suddenly he looked at me and said, "Hey Hey ... you want some notes? some Treasury Notes?" I said "Yes, of couse."<br><br>He continued, "Eh eh... I have some you know! Look, they seem to be real! I sell them to you for a good price! Taxes included of course ... I have to feed my seven children, you can understand man.... (old story) It's quite expensive. But it looks like that there is no other way to obtain it easily...."<br><br>He showed me some. Oh my, he demanded ingredients which i don't have any. What should i do? Hmm... i turned around, walked away and didn't forget to say, "The price is too expensive. I can buy cheaper. Bye!". heheh... cool escape! ^^<br><br>I kept wandering around. Then Tora called me. She was with a young lady. I approached.<br>"Hello you! How are you? Me, I'm fine! I have found a way to earn a lot of gold coins! Interested?", she welcomed. My eyes sparkled as i heard her offer. "Gold coins? Of couse, i'm interested!", i answered immediately.<br><br>_ Isabella: Do you know <strong>Sponsorship</strong>? It's an easy way to become millionaire in gold coins, like me!<br>_ Me: Ha, what is needed for that?<br>_ Isabella: The principle is very easy: you ask to your friend to sign up on DinoRPG, and for each friend who signs up and play you win a "Sponsor ticket", directly in your Inventory! These tickets give you the possibility to win many treasures!<br>_ Me: So what can we win? *more sparkling eyes*<br>_ Isabella: Most of the Tickets will give you gold coins, but people say that there is a possibility to find an extremely rare Dinoz Egg and especially very powerfull! In all case, it's really wanted by all Dinoz Masters.... Yes, once you obtain a Sponsor Ticket you can go on the Market Place to use it. You will be able to dig one square per Ticket and maybe find a big Treasure!<br>_ Me: How to sponsor?<br>_ Isabella: To sponsor, you juste have to read the Sponsor Manual that I wrote, you will find all the useful information!<br>_ Me: Thanks, i will take a look now.<br><br>After looked at the Sponsor Manual, i was really depressed! T_T They have to use Dinoland Bank so i can get my sponsor tickets. Carbuncle said, "I knew it from the start. Just an old trick!" To spirit up, we visited the food section and go-crazy there! Takoyaki, soba noodles, wonton noodles, 7-colored icecreams, sweet buns, fruit tarts... XD

                Friday, January 10th, 2010<br><br>There was no more fun for us to hang around. We kept on our journey. In fact, we already wandered around much.

                Saturday, January 9th, 2010<br><br><em>(I notice that i was wrong with date in previous entry. Sorry about that! Friday must be 8th. ^^)</em><br><br>I was in bad mood today. It's not because of Tora or Carbuncle or something. Just a strange feeling! My <em>(special)</em> friend was absent at work. She's not fine! And well, i felt sad. ^^ *sigh* Anyway, let's go to Frish Port!<br><br>Tora, Carbuncle encountered 1 Gluon and 1 Wolf. (Tora, call Korgon for help! Carbuncle, attack the wolf!)<br>Tora, Carbuncle defeated them and continued.<br>Lost 2 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_life_en.gif"><br>Gained 39 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_xp.gif"> and 431 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> (Tactics rule!)<br><br>We arrived at Frish Port. Carbuncle seemed to be the first time see beach. He was really excited. The way he looked at sand, tasted sea water,... i guessed he must be a mountain boy. hahah... i and Tora told him some about sea and Frish Port.<br><br>"Created by monks many years ago, Frish Port has rapidly flourished thanks to trade with the Atlanteid Islands." That's what the tour guide-book said.<br><br>We didn't enjoy the beach yet until we finished our jobs. We went to the meeting point to take the Black Briefcase. We obtained it from a guy with a long trench coat. This mission seems to be easy! There's nothing for us to standing there. We went find the Fish Merchant.<br><br>I thought we have to meet someone "fishy" on a boat full of fishes. But it's nothing like that at all. The fish-monger look... like a chef! With a cleaver on a hand and a big fish on other hand, he welcomed us. He finished his job and cleaned his hands before talked to us. His skill is impressive! I meant look at him. He removed fish scales, guts, chopped a big fish quickly, in about 30 seconds. I hope i won't be cursed into a fish! hahaha...<br><br>"Hello li'l boy. You are here for the Fish. Right? Here. Take it. Bring it to Dinotown before Madam Squyd's party is ruined.", he gave us the fish box.<br><br>We thanked and left. I want to eat some sea foods. Carbuncle didn't eat sea food before for sure. So we went to dinner street near the beach. After stuffed, we rested in the beach tent.
