                It's finally here! Well...almost. As you Thrust fans have noticed, I've been quite inactive in the forums lately; that's because I was getting ready for the exams, which are tomorrow. But now that that's only a visual distance away, I will be posting episodes of the Under-Dome Series right after I'm through with the examination. So stay tuned, buckle up, sit tight, and enjoy the series. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><br>BTW, today's my birthday! W00T

                Well, that was a hassle, but at least the exam is out of the way. I hope I get a good score... Oh, and thanks for all the warm felicitations <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif">; I can't believe that my birthday was just yesterday! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/huh.gif"><br>So, as usual, I'll be posting every day at 20:00-22:00 server time. I hope you will enjoy this first chunk of episode one. Peace! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><br><em>T 'n T Productions Presents:<br><strong><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_2.gif">THE UNDER-DOME SERIES<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_2.gif"><br></strong>Episode 1: New Recruits</em><br><br>Introduction<br><br>T200: Good afternoon, morning, or evening, wherever you’re from. My name is T, the co-leader of the HACA, and this is Fangstriker, the other co-leader.<br>FANG: Hi.<br>T200: First of all, I’d like to give you my regards for supporting me and Thrust throughout our adventures. Our journeys have been tough and the road has been relentless. But here we are now: we have an organization of our own, the perfect hiding place to shelter it, and the perfect man to lead it—me. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>FANG: *Snicker*<br>T200: It’s now been exactly one year since the creation of the HACA. And for the association’s birthday, we are accepting new recruits for a limited time; namely only today. That means today is a big day for the new recruits signing up for membership. In order to be part of our organization, they must pass certain criteria and be sure to keep up with the HACA standards. Sadly, not everyone will make it through, but best of luck to them, and we’ll see how things go.<br><br>---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------<br><br>T200: “So, how are the new recruits?”<br>FANG: “We’ve got a whopping 1,672 who signed in!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br>T200: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/eek.gif"> “You know, we can’t accept all of them. Firstly, they need to meet all HACA requirements. And secondly, we will have had a surplus population in the Underwater Dome by the time this is over; we’re already struggling to feed, clothe and provide medication for the members we have now.”<br>FANG: “Oh, stop moaning about these issues. See, the more members we have, the more the monthly cash income increases.”<br>T200: “And how does that work?”<br>FANG: “The more people, the more volunteers for fundraising we’ll get.”<br>T200: “And what if none of them will want to go fundraising?”<br>FANG: "We'll open an internet fundraiser."<br>T200: "Right, which means a personal information giveaway to the ravenous police."<br>FANG: “Oh...I didn't think of that..."<br>T200: *sigh* “Take them through the membership procedure anyway. If they meet our requirements, then send them into my office. And of they don’t, turn them down. I don’t want any exceptions.”<br>FANG: “Got it.”<br><br><br>This may be a little big for a 'chunk', but so what?<br><br>If any of you are reading Thrust's Tale for the first time and don't know the main plot that's taking place, ask me or look for Thrust 1 &amp; 2 in the forum.<br><br>Special thanks to Fangstriker

                *Knock, knock*<br>T200: “Come in!”<br>The first recruit stepped into T’s office and sat down in front of his desk.<br>T200: “Hi, what’s your name?”<br>KILLER60: “Killer60.”<br>T200: “Uhh…is that a name?”<br>KILLER60: “Do you mock?”<br>T200: “No, no, sorry. It’s just…uhh…very…outlandish.”<br>KILLER60: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/dontcare.gif"><br>T200: “So, Killer60, do you have any combat experience?”<br>KILLER60: “They don’t call me ‘Killer60’ for nothing.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/keepcool.gif"><br>T200: “Okaaaayyyy <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/surprised.gif">… Did you have any occupations before you applied for our organization?”<br>KILLER60: “What do you mean ‘Did I’?”<br>T200: “Well, we are a hidden association, so we don’t want our secret location to sneak into the ears of the public.”<br>KILLER60: “Oh. No.”<br>T200: “Okay. So, as you may already know, we are looking for people who are rich with rather militaristic experience. Intellectual capability and the like are secondary requirements if you want to join, not that we don’t need it, of course. Therefore, I want to know what kind of martial element you possess.”<br>KILLER60: “Okay.”<br>T200: “Are you a warrior/fighter type of guy?”<br>KILLER60: “Does the name ‘Killer60’ tell you nothing?”<br>T200: “Uhh…sure? How about thievery? Do you have any thieving experience?”<br>KILLER60: “Why do you need thieves?”<br>T200: “I don’t know. Just in case?”<br>KILLER60: “Well, I used to steal cookies from the cookie jar was I was little.”<br>T200: “Yyyyea, okay. And how about a spy? Is there a spy inside of you?”<br>KILLER60: “Does lying to my mother count?”<br>T200: *Slaps forehead* “Well, by the looks of your status, what can I say? Welcome aboard.”<br>KILLER60: “Wait. I thought I failed your test.”<br>T200: “Who cares? Now sign your name in this contract before I change my mind.”<br>Killer60 read through the contract and agreed upon it. He signed it without any further questions and was given the HACA vest and badge.<br>T200: “Next!”<br><br>Special thanks to Killer60. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif">

                Thanks, man <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"> I feel a lot better now. T 'n T Productions is back in business. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"><br><br><br>The dino signees gathered at the battle arena as Thrust had ordered. They argued and quarreled with each other about who would enter the HACA and created quite a commotion. Fricaya and Azelle tried to calm them down, but to no avail…until Thrust returned with Armstrong.<br>ARMSTRONG: “<strong>Soldiers, ATTENTION!!!</strong>”<br>The deafening roar shocked the new recruits into silence. Like a band of military marines, they formed ranks and stood straight.<br>AZELLE: “Wow, that was easy…for you.”<br>ARMSTRONG: “Thrust, do you have something to say before I proceed?”<br>THRUST: “Yea. Welcome, everybody, to the HACA. All 1,672 of you have signed the papers in anticipation to become a member. However, we cannot accept all of you, and so therefore we are holding a test for you all at this battle arena. Armstrong the gorilloz here will be conducting your trial of entry. After this is over, we will determine who gets in and who goes out. Okay, Armstrong.”<br>ARMSTRONG: “The test is simple. All you have to do is prove your combative capabilities by dueling each other in this arena. It doesn’t necessarily matter whether you win or lose, all you have to do show that you are physically proficient to enter the HACA. We will be organizing duel right now. Prepare, soldiers!”<br><br>8 hours of organizing and reorganizing later<br><br>THRUST: “Phew! Finally…done!…”<br>ARMSTRONG: “And now, soldiers, the duels begin! Nero the sirain and Tarjeteer the pteroz, you’re up!”<br>THRUST: “Wait! There are gonna be 836 duels. Are we going to go through them one by one?”<br>ARMSTRONG (ignoring him): “Contestants, start…NOW!!!”<br>THRUST: “Gaaahhh!... This is gonna be a loooong day…”<br>The first duel started. Nero and Tarjeteer took their places within the ring. Tarjeteer made the first move: he aggressively took to the air and inhaled a mouthful of air to discharge <em>burning breath</em>. But Nero saw that coming: thanks to his <em>perception</em> skill, he foresaw the attack and spurted <em>water canon</em> square in the mouth of the pteroz, blasting him out of the ring.<br>THRUST: “Hey, that wasn’t so bad for a start.”<br>FRICAYA: “It’s only the first duel. Don’t rush it.”<br>ARMSTRONG: “Next duel!”

                Next chunk:<br><br><br>The situation with the dino recruits wasn’t any better. By far, Nero was the only adequate candidate for membership. Everybody else who dueled (to use a common phrase) sucked. A winks attempted <em>cold shower</em>, but failed to realize that the battle was indoors (so he couldn’t actually summon it). A similar blunder was done by a wanwan, only he used <em>lightning</em>. Other fails included a gorilloz who nearly broke a window (In the Underwater Dome? O.o ), a cloudoz who used <em>mistral</em> on a rocky (which is a bad idea since rockies are stationary dinoz)*, a water-based hippoclamp who used <em>water canon</em> on a giant earthworm (Who brought that in here?), a freak castivorous who ran away at the sight of a smashroom (Okay, who’s in charge of the smuggling operations?! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"> ), and countless more.<br>Nevertheless, there were still more than half of the fights left to go, and the next contestant was surprisingly familiar…<br>THRUST, AZELLE &amp; FRICAYA: “Welceon?”<br>WELCEON: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br>ARMSTRONG: “Enough chitchat, let’s get started! Welceon and Machibusé, you’re up!”<br>Welceon and his opponent, a kabuki, stepped into the ring. At that, everybody intuited that it was going to be a tough fight for the sirain. Not only was it going to be tough, but Machibusé was known for his sneaky attacks using <em>aqueous clones</em>. But Welceon did not shudder.<br>The bell rang, the fight began! <br>As expected, Machibusé summoned four <em>aqueous clones</em> and was about to surround Welceon. But Welceon was smarter than that. Thanks to his sharp sirain vision, he fired a <em>Sher-Kaar beam</em> at each of the kabukis’ eyes simultaneously, zapping the clones out of existence and then fired a pressurized <em>water canon</em> at the distracted kabuki. <br>Game, set, match: Welceon arose victorious! It was a huge relief for Thrust, Azelle and Fricaya as well; they were hoping that Welceon was capable enough to join, and he was.

                The next contestant was another familiar guy.<br>THRUST: “Hey, Zendude.”<br>ZENDUDE: “Yo.”<br>Zendude was the kabuki that T donated to the Zenzen monks. Originally, his name was Zenmon, but he changed it to Zendude. He is also known amongst his friends for always answering offhandedly with statements like the one he just mentioned, and he never speaks more than one word in a sentence.<br>Zendude was up against L’Ammiraglio, a <strong>level 50</strong> Italian hippoclamp! <br>L’AMMIRAGLIO: “I a take a you down!”<br>But Zendude only returned a lazy glance and raised his eyebrows a little.<br>L’Ammiraglio attacked: he sent a awe-striking wave of <em>fireball</em>, <em>vines</em>, <em>Sher-Kaar beam</em>, <em>flash wave</em>, and <em>tornado</em>—all in one motion! But Zendude simply turned <em>vaporous form</em> and allowed all the blasts pass through him. (What a waste of awesome energy… -_-) Outraged, L’Ammiraglio <em>charged</em> at Zendude in full <em>fury</em>. He <em>focused</em>, summoned <em>wrath</em> and <em>blowtorch palm</em> as he bulleted for the kabuki. No biggie for him, though. With an easy gesture of his hand, a <em>black hole</em> opened beneath L’Ammiraglio’s feet and he fell into it, leaving Zendude simply the winner of that match. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"><br><br>Enjoy! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif">

                Glad you like it. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br>And don't worry: even though this is mostly a comedy Series, there are going to be all sorts of genres in it. Now, let's pull out the next chunk:<br><br><br>Following him and Welceon, the rest of the contestants showed favorable results. Leafblaze, Welceon’s adventure buddy, summoned an army of <em>korgon reinforcements</em> against a feross; with the uncountable number of korgons on his side, he was able to crack through the feross’ <em>cuirass</em> and win the duel. Then there was a softpig named Charge who won by a landslide against a wanwan of extreme <em>celerity</em>; when the wanwan plunged for an attack, Charge counterattacked his moves with devastating <em>vengeance</em> and <em>waikikido</em> skills. Other contestant showed similarly good results. Of course, not all of them were that impressive, but the aftermath of these duels was more pleasing than the first half.<br>Many more hours later, and they were finally done! Thrust, Azelle and Fricaya nearly dropped to the floor out of exhaustion; only Armstrong, the military gorilloz, stood strong. All that was left to do was to discuss who would enter and then announce the winners. That took another few hours, but they endured it.

                And finally, it was time to announce the accepted nominees. Armstrong read through the list as hearts raced and hands trembled. The first to be announced was Nero. The sirain proudly stepped right beside Armstrong with his chin held high like a ‘ruler of the world’. Following Nero were Welceon, Leafblaze, Zendude, L’Ammiraglio, Machibusé, Charge, and plenty more. That having finally been done, Thrust and the rest were finally ready to close the day.<br>But then, suddenly, a deafening sound of an explosion roared into all of the rooms in the Underwater Dome.<br>THRUST: “What was that?!?!”<br>L’AMMIRAGLIO: “A kaboom.”<br>THRUST: “Yes, I know that! But what was <em>that</em>?!”<br>As imminently as the explosion occurred, the alarm went off with flashing red lights and a mechanical sound chanted: “Intruder alert! Intruder alert!”<br>ARMSTRONG: “Somebody must’ve blasted their way in. Thrust, get everybody here to spread out to look for this intruder! I’ll go an alert the humans!”<br>THRUST: “On it!”

This is the newest addition to the whole Thrust story. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br> And sorry that I haven't been posting for a few days. I haven't written this episode completely, so it might need some time, but it will be back shortly after I've finished it. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>Also, I once said in a previous thread that I'd post some pictures of Thrust (and maybe some other characters). Well, I got a couple of them ready, but now I'm on a mission to find a scanner (because my pictures are pencil-drawn <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif">).

                Next chunk, coming through! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><br><br>A GORILLOZ: “Take that, spy!!!”<br>It seemed that the real spy was finally caught! (BTW, it was the same gorilloz who nearly broke the window.) Thrust rushed to the site where a fierce battle took place between the gorilloz and the spy. But before he could get there, the gorilloz smashed a window in the room and slammed the door behind him, leaving the spy to drown.<br>THRUST (arriving): “So where’s the spy?”<br>GORILLOZ: “Left ‘im in there. Ha! ‘E’ll never get outta there!”<br>Thrust looked through the window in the door to have a look at the spy.<br>THRUST (half-angry): “Uh, gorilloz, that’s no spy…”<br>GORILLOZ: “Oh…it ain’t?” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br>THRUST: “NO!!! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif">  That’s Machibusé, ya dummy!”<br>GORILLOZ: “…Sorry… <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif">… At least ‘e’s a kabuki: water dino.”<br>THRUST: “But he doesn’t have gills: he can’t breathe underwater.”<br>GORILLOZ: “Meh, no worries. Sooner or later he’ll be back with us, safe and sound in one piece.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br>But then a school of pirhanoz creep in through the broken window and attack Machibusé.<br>THRUST: O.O “Ooh…umm…ouch…uh…hmm…<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif">…ow… Uh, guys, cancel Machibusé’s application too!...”<br>GORILLOZ: O.o’

                Okay, here's the next-to-last bit. If you guys don't understand what's going on, or just don't understand because you don't know English well, ask me, and I'll help out. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br><br>ARMSTRONG: “Thrust! There you are! Still haven’t found the spy?”<br>Armstrong appeared after a few minutes with an electronic device in his hand.<br>THRUST: “Nightmarishly, no…”<br>ARMSTRONG: “Well that’s okay. I have what we need! *Shows the device* It’s a DNA scanner.”<br>THRUST: “What?”<br>ARMSTRONG: “DNA scanner.”<br>THRUST: “I can see that it’s a DNA scanner, but why a DNA scanner?”<br>ARMSTRONG: “Let me explain. You see those cameras in the room? *Points at the cameras fitted at the corners of the chamber*”<br>THRUST: “Yes.”<br>ARMSTRONG: “Those are not visional cameras, they’re DNA sensors. They pick up DNA patterns from anyone in the room and scan them to see if they’re familiar. Each room in the Underwater Dome has several of these. If they find a DNA pattern that’s unfamiliar, they’ll send that information to the monitors in the control room for inspection, and what this device in my hand does is it finds any sort of DNA pattern that I ask it to.”<br>THRUST (relieved): “Great, so we finally have a decent solution out of this mess! So, given that we have an intruder, which we do, how do we find him with that?”<br>ARMSTRONG: “I’ll just ask it to look for an unfamiliar pattern.”<br>Armstrong switched the scanner on and set it to look for foreign DNA patterns. Soon enough, a digital map of the Underwater Dome appeared on its screen with a flashing red glow on one of the rooms.<br>ARMSTRONG: “We got ‘em!”

                And for that, I have to thank you. If it hadn't been for The Story of Welceon, I might never have started Thrust's Tale. So thank you very much for being my inspiration. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br>Oh, and sorry for not bumping your topic on time...<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif">... I guess making excuses wouldn't do much justice, so...I'm terribly sorry...<br>Here's the last chunk of episode one. Enjoy, guys.<br><br><br>Thrust and Armstrong sped through the Dome’s corridors to get to their destination. And when they got there, they realized that they weren’t the first to reach the spy, to their relief. Welceon, Fricaya, and Nero were there, squirting pressurized <em>water canons</em> at the suspect who cowered skittishly* in a corner of the room.<br>THRUST: “Good work, guys!”<br>WELCEON: “It’s the least we can do as members of the HACA.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br>However, something was not right…<br>THRUST: “Wait a sec… Guys, cease fire!...err…water!...?” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br>The three sirains stopped their assaults, and sure enough, out of the blue of wet misfortune, the voice of an average Joe said:<br>“Pizza guy… Pizza delivery!”<br>ARMSTRONG: “Say whaaaaaat?!?!” O_o<br>THRUST: “You’re a pizza delivery guy?”<br>PIZZA GUY (angrily): “Well, yea! What do I look like? Agent 007?!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"><br>THRUST: *For a moment we thought you did.* “Uhh…Armstrong, is that thing still pointing us here?”<br>ARMSTRONG: “…Yea… Apparently, anything unfamiliar to it is an enemy, so…”<br>FRICAYA: “Wow, Thrust. I’ve never seen you fail this badly in my life…” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/evil.gif"><br>NERO: “Epic fail. You’d make a good slapstick scene in Thalia’s** artistry collection…jackass!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twisted.gif"><br>THRUST: T_T<br>Following the sirains’ blaming Thrust, T came into the room, a bit shocked at what had happened.<br>T200: “What the heck happened here?”<br>PIZZA GUY: “Your crazy dinoz attacked me, that’s what!”<br>T200: “Oh… Thrust!!”<br>THRUST: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/rolleyes.gif"><br>T200: “Sorry about that…”<br>PIZZA GUY: “That’ll be 500<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif">”<br>T200: “500<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> ?! But I only asked for 100<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> worth of pizza!”<br>PIZZA GUY: “Believe me, you have <strong>no</strong> idea what I had to go through to get here!” &gt;:[]<br>It took a little while for the dispute between T and the pizza guy to settle. But eventually, T agreed to pay the extra amount and the group dispersed out of the room.<br>However, as soon as the room was empty—or so everyone thought—the true spy, a small, dwarfish man, climbed out of the wine barrel that happened to be in the room. He took out his radio and called his master.<br>CONQUEROR COMMANDER: “Infiltration report.”<br>DWARF: “I’ve successfully infiltrated the Underwater Dome and managed to trick the DNA cameras thanks to that stupid unsuspecting pizza guy.”<br>CONQ. COMMANDER: “Excellent! Now with their guard down and their whereabouts unraveled, we can move on as planned.”<br>DWARF: “I think it might be a bit early, sir.”<br>CONQ. COMMANDER: “What do you mean?”<br>DWARF: “These guys are a lot stronger than I expected. They’ve killed both my two dinoz: L’Ammiraglio and Machibusé, and one of them was a level 50 dino. It would be wiser if you let me stay here and investigate before we move on with the plans.”<br>CONQ. COMMANDER: “Then do so. You have until next summer before we attack. Is that enough time?”<br>DWARF: “That’ll be plenty. I have to log out before these guys pick up my radio signals. May the Conquerors be victorious!” *Switches off radio*<br><br>To be continued...<br><br><br>Skittish* -- easily frightened<br>Thalia** -- the Greek goddess of comedy. She is one of the nine Muses. Nero mentioned the goddess because his body had been possessed by the spirit of a well known Roman Emperor ever since he was born. (Although I don't know what the Roman version for Thalia is, so I'll just keep it this way.)

                Ok, guys. Episode 2 will come on the 6th of this months, so that's two days. But instead of posting it at 20:00 server time, I will let you guys decide what time you want me to post these episodes. So if there if there is a specific time that is more comfortable for you than 20:00, vote here before July 6. I will see how many of your votes we have received and determine the best posting time according to them. If there are no votes, then there will be no change.<br><br>And another thing: for you US players out there (including me), Happy July 4th!! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"> Yup! Have a nice holiday today to spend some time with your friends, family, and whatnot. I'll be going on a camping trip in a couple of hours, but I'll be back soon to resume the Under-Doem Series...and post come pics in the new picture thread. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><br>Peace for now, guys!

                Well, if that's the case, then I guess any time would be alright. From this day, I'm posting every morning at 8:00 server time. As for now, I present to you the first chunk of episode 2. Enjoy. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><br><br><strong><em>Episode Two: Junior Veteran</em></strong><br><br>On a late summer night, Thrust lay fast asleep next to T on his bed. He dreamed of fantasy, a perfect world where nothing could go wrong, as he stood at the foot of a soaring tower that gazed over the great valley like a king of all creation.<br>He shouted to his darling, who watched down from the top of that tower with a yearning heart to be with him.<br>THRUST: “Azelle, Azelle, let down your hair, so that I may climb the golden stair.”<br>AZELLE: “Aw, crud. I just had a haircut.” -_-<br>THRUST: “You…wait… You had a haircut? Isn’t Dame Gothel** the one who is supposed to cut your hair when she figures that I’ve been paying you visits? You know, sometime later in the Rapunzel* plot?”<br>AZELLE: “Umm, yea. But, you see, can you imagine a wanwan with 100-foot-long hair that acts as climbing gear? I just thought that such a wanwan would not be very, well, attractive…”<br>THRUST: *slaps forehead*<br>AZELLE: “…so I decided to cut my hair to look a little prettier.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br>THRUST: “You…cut your hair…to look prettier?...”<br>AZELLE: “Just for you.” ^ ^<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/love.gif"><br>THRUST: *groan* “So how do you expect me to climb up there without your hair?”<br>AZELLE: “Think up of something. You’re the prince, not me.”<br>THRUST: “Grrrrrr…” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twisted.gif"><br>Thrust looked around to find another way to gain access to his “Rapunzel”. Fortunately for him, there was a tall fence, which he could climb, that stood up against the wall of the tower. But on the unfortunate side, the fence was covered in thorny briar*** vines. He felt a bit awkward about climbing it, but he had no other choice: he took his first step up.<br>THRUST: “MEOUCH!!!”<br><br><br>Rapunzel* - a famous German fairytale about a beautiful maiden who was trapped inside a tower and who had long hair wih which her lover would climb up to her.<br>Dame Gothel** - the antagonist of the fairytale, the stepmother of Rapunzel who trapped her in the tower.<br>Briar*** (also brier) [brye-er] - a thorny plant. In the fairytale, the prince falls into thorns after he is pushed off the tower by Dame Gothel, although it is uncertain what kind of throny plant he falls into (at least I don't know).

                Halfway up the agonizing stairs.<br><br>THRUST (to himself): “How come that in my own fantasy I end up being the one to walk the <strong>thorny path</strong>?”<br>AZELLE: “Oh, Thrust! My heart longeth for thy heroic touch, thy voice that I haveth fallen in love with, thy gleaming eyes that I desireth to bathe in. Pray, my love, pray come to me and let me sinketh into thy arms and deeper still into thy heart forever and ever more!”<br>THRUST (silently): “Yea, and progress would be a lot quicker if you just keep quiet!” &gt;:[<br>Suddenly, the sound of a doorbell rang throughout the valley. O_o<br>THRUST: “Who dares interrupt my dreaming?”<br>The doorbell rang again.<br>THRUST: “Gah! Azelle, could you please wait a bit. I have to wake up and answer the door.”<br>AZELLE: “You will come back for me, right?”<br>THRUST: “Of course… *unless I forget*”<br>At that the vines started to break under Thrust’s weight—not the kind of descent he was hoping for. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br>THRUST: “Uh-oh… *vine snaps* AAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!”<br>Crash! Thrust landed on the floor. He was back in T’s room in the real world, as he could tell from the drowsiness he was feeling. Nevertheless, somebody was at the door. So he rubbed his eyes, and made his way to the front door.<br>The bell rang several more times before Thrust could actually make it. He could tell that whoever was ringing it was losing his patience, but the wanwan excused his own slow pace with the thought that the unnecessary noise was disturbing people’s sleep.<br>Finally, Thrust opened the door and saw a mailman.<br>MAILMAN: “It’s about time! Do you know how long it took you to get here?!”<br>THRUST: “Shh! Not so loud: people are sleeping here. You know it’s rude to shout in the middle of the night. Have you ever heard of noise pollution?”<br>MAILMAN: “Whatever. I have a letter for a Thrust. Do you know a Thrust around here?”<br>THRUST: “That would be me.”<br>MAILMAN: “Excellent. Here you go.”<br>The mailman handed him the letter and left not a minute later. As soon as the mail guy left, Thrust opened the envelope and read through the letter with his tired eyes. Nevertheless, he could read it clearly…to his despair…<br>THRUST: “NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!...”

                The next morning…or whatever… <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br><br>The two dining halls (one for human and the other for dinoz) were compacted with life. In the human hall, T and his friends were having a healthy breakfast while they discussed serious matters for upcoming events. The same was brewing up in the dinoz hall: every dino were chatting with each other as they wolfed down their meals. Many of the talks were based on serious topics—only Fricaya and Skora were spending their time jollily as they ate their breakfast rations slowly. They were soon joined by Azelle, who came late.<br>SKORA: “Good morning, Azelle.”<br>AZELLE: “G’morning, ladies.”<br>FRICAYA: “Did you have a good sleep?”<br>AZELLE: “I sure did.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>SKORA: “You seem cheery this morning. What’s the occasion?”<br>AZELLE: “Well, I just had the most wonderful dream in my life!”<br>FRICAYA &amp; SKORA: “O RLY?”<br>FRICAYA: “What was it about?”<br>AZELLE (dreamily): “It’s too perfect to explain…” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/love.gif"><br>SKORA: O_O “That’s not the Azelle I know.”<br>FRICAYA: “I think she needs serious help.”<br>SKORA: “Yea. Quick, call Dr. Dolittle. He’ll understand us.”

                A minute later, Thrust appeared in the scene along with the korgons, looking down and unenthusiastic to do anything.<br>AZELLE: “Thrust, you’re late for breakfast.”<br>THRUST: “Yes, I know…”<br>AZELLE: “What’s wrong?”<br>AMIGO: “Thrust is having a family reunion.”<br>AZELLE: “O RLY?”<br>THRUST: “Yea really…”<br>AZELLE: “NO WY!

                T, Thrust, Azelle, and the Three Korgons arrived at the door simultaneously to meet the guests. Walking into the room, and welcomes by T and the dinoz, was Elizabeth. T and Elizabeth shook hands as they greeted each other—an old friendship reunion.<br>T200: “Nice to meet you again, Liz.”<br>ELIZABETH: “Nice to see you again, too. How have you been?”<br>AMIGO: “Wait, senor, you know this senorita?”<br>T200: “Sure, she helped me get around in the Dinoland Market Place when I was a lot younger. I’m very grateful to her for that.”<br>ELIZABETH: “We haven’t heard from each other for quite a while, so when I heard that T was living in the Under-Water Dome, I thought I’d drop by.”<br>Following Elizabeth came her wanwans: Arctica, a light-blue wanwan who was also Thrust’s aunt, and her triplets.<br>ARCTICA: “Hi, nephew!”<br>THRUST (halfheartedly): “Hello, Aunt Arctica.”<br>ARCTICA (turning to Azelle): “Oh, hello.”<br>AZELLE: “Nice to meet you.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br>Pottle, the first of the triplets, came from behind Arctica first, followed by Bottle, and Throttle, who skipped his way gleefully towards Thrust.<br>THROTTLE (with an extra loud voice): “Hi, cousin!”<br>THRUST: “Throttle, the last time I saw you, you had orange fur. Why did you dye it blue?”<br>Thrust did not intend his response to be welcoming, although he tried to slip a tone of hospitality into it to hide its repulsive nature.<br>THROTTLE: “Now that’s what I call a stupid question. C’mon, Thursty, where’s that clowny side you used to have when I was newborn kitten?”<br>AZELLE (giggling): “You had a ‘clowny’ side? Heehee!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/lol.gif"><br>THRUST: “Grrrrr… That’s none of your business!”<br>ARCTICA: “Yea, Thrust, you did a great job making my three little angels laugh. You were just like an older brother to them.”<br><br><cite>THRUST: “So, you said you had a rat here?”<br>ARCTICA: “Yes, and there’s no way I can get rid of it. My paws are too full with my new triplets.”<br>THRUST: “I’ll take care of it then. Where are you, mousy? Mousy? Come out, come out, wherever you are!”<br>Thrust looked under a small table, not noticing that the mouse hole was just underneath HIM…underneath his heinie…<br>THRUST: “Mousy! Mousy!

                Meanwhile, far off at the Fountain of Youth<br><br>A black wanwan sat meditating on the rim of the Fountain of Youth. He sat there completely motionless, as motionless as if he was dead, but he was still alive. His evil orange eye rested behind their lids as the wanwan meditated away with an empty mind—no thought or longing desire could disturb him, save one thing…<br>“Enoch! Enoch!”<br>The voice rang in his head.<br>ENOCH: “I hear you, Lord Honorus.”<br>HONORUS: “Our dwarfish spy has reported in and says that Thrust is distracted. Now is the perfect time to sabotage our ultimate enemy.”<br>Enoch’s vile orange eyes opened in a flash and a smirk cracked on his face. He jumped off the rim of the Fountain and said:<br>ENOCH: “It will be done, Lord.”<br>HONORUS: “Wait.”<br>ENOCH: “Yes, my Lord.”<br>HONORUS: “Before you go, I must adjust your powers.”<br>ENOCH: “My Lord, sir?”<br>HONORUS: “Electrocute the tree near you.”<br>Enoch obeyed; even though it was a trivial order, he did not want to question the high lord. He concentrated at the tree and displayed a piece of his resentment on it…but nothing happened…<br>HONORUS: “Haha! I knew it!”<br>ENOCH (perplexed): “What’s going on?”<br>HONORUS: “I’ve replaced your powers. Lightning, like all its brother and sister elements are weak! I’ve toyed too long with them, and they’ve done me little good. So I’ve invented my own element, something of myself, and now I grant it to you.”<br>ENOCH: “What is this new element?”<br>HONORUS: “You’ll see: concentrate on that same tree.”<br>Enoch concentrated, as his lord said. For a moment, he felt nothing, and neither did the tree. Another minute passed, but still nothing happened. But he still persevered, and finally discovered the new element. The tree started to wither away at an incredible speed, as if time had been accelerated for that poor plant. At that instant, Enoch felt something new in him, something unlike the lightning element that he was used to. The feeling was indescribable…<br>HONORUS: “Behold, your new element. I call it—Arcane*…”<br><br><br>Arcane* - a new element that I created just for fun. In the story, Enoch is the only dino who possesses arcane powers, while Honorus is the only non-dino existence that possesses them. I'm also creating arcane's very own skill tree, again, for the fun of it. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><br>Good luck on the monster hunt, everybody!

                Putting that aside, Thrust guided his relatives to the final chamber of the Under-Water Dome; a massive chamber equipped with machines, humungous turbines connected to equally large batteries that stored massive amounts of energy to feed the whole undersea sanctuary—all this controlled by a handful of people located at the upper floor of the chamber to overlook the monumental contraption.<br>THRUST’S RELATIVES: “Whoa!”<br>THRUST: “This is the water room. It’s probably one of the most important chambers in the Under-Water Dome, if not <em>the</em> most important. It alone takes up 27% of free space of the Dome, and for a good reason: the water room is where we let sea water flow in to be used for drinking, laundry, fire extinguishing, cooking, bathing, other things, and, most importantly, to provide us with energy. The water first passes through a large filter located at one end of this chamber, then the water is organized into four groups of pipelines manually by these guys (indicating the controllers). These groups are categorized as energy, emergency, victuals*, and cleaning.<br>POTTLE: “And what’s the huge turbine for?”<br>THROTTLE: “Hey, I’m supposed to ask that!”<br>THRUST: “The turbine is our power generator. Pressurized sea water flows in and spins the turbine to produce energy, which we then either send throughout the Dome system, or store in those batteries. These batteries are a backup source of energy in case we run into a crisis.”<br>THROTTLE: “Ooh, and what does this button do?”<br>THRUST: “DON’T!!!…”<br>Thrust tackled Throttle before he could push the large bead-like button on the center of the keyboard.<br>ARCTICA: “Throttle!”<br>BOTTLE: “Nice move, bro.”<br>THRUST: “Never ever push that button!”<br>THROTTLE: “Why not?”<br>THRUST: “Two reasons—One: it’ll open up he floodgates to the max, allowing the water to gush in and flood the water room, and probably the destroy the whole Dome; Two: the button says, ‘<strong>Do Not Push</strong>’!”<br>POTTLE: “Yea, Throttle. Thrust, maybe it’s time to leave this room before destructive Throttle destroys destructively in his own destructive ways.”<br>And so, they briskly left the room. Soon after, the lunch bell rang, and the controller turned the machines on auto-control to leave for lunch. However, nobody was aware that with the people gone, an evil presence broke in. A black wanwan, like a ghost, walked in through the wall—Enoch. He glanced around at the water room, and then grinned fiendishly.<br>ENOCH: “Thanks for the info, Thrust.”<br><br><br>Victuals* - food, provisions

                Sorry for the little delay. Here's the next chunk.<br><br><br>At the meeting room<br><br>T200: “So, how did this all happen?”<br>ELIZABETH: “It seemed to have started when a newly elected congressman was chosen for president of Dinoland. You’ve heard about the presidential election, right?”<br>T200: “Who hasn’t?”<br>ELIZABETH: “Yes. Well, apparently, he belongs to a group of other newcomers who have gained a notorious reputation after the election of one of their members.”<br>T200: “The way you say ‘notorious’ doesn’t sound good.”<br>ELIZABETH: “Exactly. They’ve reshaped the Dinoland constitution and now the people are going crazy. The economy has crashed, crime rate has skyrocketed, and the police are doing nothing about it. But the most peculiar thing is that the new government is establishing hardcore dino training centers all over Dinoland for who knows what purpose.”<br>T200: “Hmm…that <em>is</em> strange. This is something worth investigating.”<br>ELIZABETH: “Be careful, though. The new president has also started a nationwide abduction* program for any HACA member or anybody who are in any way associated with them. I only nearly escape an abduction before I got here.”<br>T200: “Wow, and how is Garland taking that?”<br>ELIZABETH: “He seems to be enjoying the new government establishment. In fact, he even put most wanted posters of you all over the nation. It might be too dangerous for you or any HACA member to enter Dinoland now.”<br>T200: “Well, do you think it’ll cool down eventually?”<br>ELIZABETH: “I doubt it.”<br>T200: “Then we’ll still have to investigate. We’ve first got to collect information on this new president, then we’ll take it from there.”

                Sorry, guys, but there will not be another chunk of this episode today. Like Killer60 said in Fangstriker's topic, we writers do get a little tired and need a break. So me and Thrust will take a few days off of the writing business, and then we'll come back. So stay tuned! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif">

                Okay, here's another chunk. I haven't been writing so much because my friend has come over from the US for a month, so I'm going to be busy giving him tours around Vilnius and so forth. <br><br>AZELLE: “Do you think I’ll ever have that dream again?”<br>SKORA: “C’mon, Azelle, it’s just a dream. Welcome to the real world—no dreams allowed.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"><br>AZELLE: “Sorry, but wouldn’t you think the same if you had a dream like mine?”<br>SKORA: “Fine, what was in your dream, then?”<br>AZELLE: “Well, I was on a tower waiting for Thrust to arrive.”<br>SKORA: “And?”<br>AZELLE: “He arrived. And he asked me to give him access to me. But I couldn’t, and because of my fault, Thrust had to climb the thorny path up a ladder of briar. And then…the briar couldn’t hold his weight. I swear: if anyone were to figure out my feelings for that special wanwan, I’d be devastated! I only trust the dinoz who already know this and who pledge to keep it a secret for the rest of their nine lives!”<br>SKORA: “Haha! Unlike you wanwans, we glidewings don’t have nine lives. And besides—I didn’t know you had feelings for Thrust. O RLY???”<br>AZELLE: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/eek.gif"><br>SKORA: “YA RLY!!! W00T! Hey, guys! Guess who’s got dibs!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/lol.gif"><br>AZELLE: “No! Don’t!”<br>But Skora zapped away before Azelle could stop her.<br>AZELLE: “*sigh* Life would be sweeter with Thrust around. I wish he was here now…”<br>ENOCH: “I can be of assistance.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/keepcool.gif"><br>Azelle turned around to face the mysterious voice. But when she did, an <em>arcane blast</em> knocked her unconscious…

                You know what? Since I've managed to write the chunk today, why don't I just post it right now, eh?

It can’t be over!”<br>ARCTICA: “Thank you for giving us a wonderful tour around our new home, nephew.”<br>THRUST (unenthusiastically): “Yes, yes, welcome to your new home.

How stupefying.”<br>BOTTLE: “I don’t give a dang.” -_-<br>With that, the family went to the cafeteria, leaving Thrust some breathing space from Throttle.<br>THRUST: “Huh! Finally! I get to have a break — for five minutes at least!”<br>He spoke too soon: A second later, the Three Korgons crashed into him while running and tumbled down the stairs with a loud thud in the end..<br>AMIGO: “Hola, man!”<br>THRUST: “Give me a break, Amigo! As a pal, you’re bad enough.”<br>AMIGO: “You talking about Throttle, no?”<br>THRUST: “Yes, the one and only… And what about you, where are you three running off to?”<br>AMIGO: “We’re still running away from the one with the glowing eyeballs.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/lol.gif"><br>AMIGOS: “Look out!

The korgons continued running, making jokes of the angered amphibian while he fired ceaseless rounds of <em>Sher-Kaar</em> ammunition.<br>Thrust shook his head at that “kindergarten”, as if those korgons would never grow up. But then, turning his head, he looked through the window into the water room and witnessed the most mortifying sight he had seen in a long time…

                THRUST: <strong>“AZELLE!!!”</strong><br>Helpless Azelle was tied to a turbine in the water room, slowly rotating, threatening to drown her slowly in the icy water of the ocean below. And beside the turbine stood a hated nemesis: Enoch…<br>ENOCH (smirking): “Well, Thrust. It looks like I didn’t have to invite you to our little gathering after all. Maybe fate had been planning our encounter all this time.”<br>It appeared that he had noticed Thrust before he noticed him. Nevertheless, unruly anger boiled within Thrust and drove him to <em>focus</em> and crash through the glass window. Now in the water room, he sped from platform to platform until was close enough to throw a <em>focused</em> tackle at Enoch.<br>However, the prepared Enoch foresaw that coming; he turned his head to an adjacent gadget and, as if aided with an unseen arm, hurled towards Thrust, knocking him off course with a brutal blow!<br>THRUST: “What was that?”<br>He landed safely on another platform, thanks be to his wanwan instincts, but he suffered a fractured rib bone in his side and was now struggling to keep standing.<br>ENOCH: “Thrust, I do believe you are the first of my enemies to witness the new element, which Honorus granted me — arcane.”<br>THRUST: “Arcane?”<br>ENOCH: “It’s the element of the mind, and the attack you just saw was called <em>telepathic attack</em>. Everybody has some arcane energy in them, just like every dino has a bit of every combat element known to us. However, this arcane energy is so weak, that scientists have not even noticed it in dinoz. But my lord Honorus amplified my arcane energy, hus giving me access to unlimited powers!”<br>THRUST: “I don’t care. I can beat you! I’ve done so before, and I can do it even with a cracked rib cage!”<br>ENOCH: “I wouldn’t be so sure. Even if you were able to beat me, you wouldn’t have enough time to save your beloved.”<br>THRUST: “She’s not my…what?!”<br>ENOCH: “That’s right. You only have five minutes till the turbine makes half a turn and drowns her. So, let the fight begin.”<br>With that, Thrust <em>focused</em> with all the energy he had and attacked. Enoch, charged up with arcane power to the point where his eyes were glowing with arcane essence, followed suit. The next thing you knew, the two collided…

                Throttle, unaware of the danger threatening the Underrate Dome, snuck into the control panel of the water room.<br>THROTTLE: *Buuuuuurrrrrrrp!!* “Wow, that Atlanteid soda sure knocked me out. The food here is here is excellent! Not like those hard, crunchy, stone-like things that Liz gives me. Thrust is so lucky to live here! That lucky bastard.”<br>Then, a glowing red object caught his attention: the same red button that Thrust told him not to touch.<br>THROTTLE: “Ooooooohhh, shiny! Oh, wait, that’s the same button I’m not allowed to push. Aw, man! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"> I’m not allowed to do anything anywhere! It’s like people treat me like a kitten!…apart that I am a kitten. Oh, but the temptation! The flashing red light reminds me of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Santaz! What am I gonna do?!”<br>Just then, he looked out at the water room to see, at his astonishment, Thrust ferociously battling a black wanwan.<br>Thrust combined <em>focus</em> with <em>hermetic aura</em>, turning himself into a ball of energy to ram at Enoch, but Enoch used <em>time control</em> and dodged the attack with ease.<br>THRUST (thinking to himself): “Hmm, a direct approach won’t do, but maybe something far-ranged will.”<br>Thrust fired a <em>flash wave</em> at Enoch, only to have it reflected back at him by Enoch’s <em>arcane mirror</em> (Thrust dodged it, but only barely). Then, he <em>concentrated</em> a <em>lightning attack</em> on the metal bars, walls, and landings of the room: the electricity conducted through them and attacked Enoch. For the first time, Thrust managed to deal some damage, but Enoch quickly opened a <em>force field</em> after being hit.<br>THROTTLE: “That’s right! Give it to ‘em, Thrust!”<br>Of course, neither of the fighters could hear the juvenile wanwan behind the glass.<br>Enoch used another <em>telepathic attack</em>, throwing his adversary into a wall and then sent him crashing into a platform above him. But now Thrust was angry. His rib cage was screaming for a timeout, but he didn’t listen and <em>concentrated</em> harder on the metal all around with <em>lightning attack</em>, this time even adding <em>focus</em> in the combination.<br>ZAP!!! KABOOM!!! CRACK!!!<br>Thrust’s lightning spewed in from all corners of the chamber, mercilessly punishing Enoch and shattering all the windows of the upper floors!<br>THROTTLE: “Awesome! One more time! Show ‘em what you’ve got!”<br>This time, with the broken windows, Thrust could hear him loud and clear.<br>THRUST: “Throttle!”<br>THROTTLE: “Here!”<br>THRUST: “I need your help — urgently!”

                Enoch used <em>recover</em> to heal his burns while Thrust used <em>leafy dawn</em> to mend his broken rib, but Throttle interrupted him.<br>THROTTLE: “Reporting for duty!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>THRUST: “Throttle, I need you to push that button.”<br>THROTTLE: “Which button?”<br>THRUST: “<strong>The</strong> button!

Infuriated like an ill-tempered lion, he pounced at Thrust and fired an <em>arcane blast</em>. But he dodged the attack and escaped to a safe distance.<br>THRUST: “Push the big, red button!”<br>THROTTLE: “You mean the one that says ‘Do not push’?”<br>THRUST: “Yes, that one!”<br>Again, he nearly escaped an attack from the dark wanwan — this time a flying object from Enoch’s <em>telepathic attack</em>.<br>THROTTLE: “Are you sure?”<br>THRUST: “Yes!”<br>Enoch fired several more <em>arcane blasts</em> before Thrust retaliated with a <em>lightning attack</em>, which Enoch reflected with an <em>arcane mirror</em>.<br>THROTTLE: “Are you really sure?”<br>THRUST: “Yes!!”<br>Thrust hid in a small crevice formed from the collision of the two, hoping to be a difficult target from there, while still being able to talk to Throttle.<br>THROTTLE: “Are you really, really, sure?”<br>THRUST: <strong>“YES!!!”</strong><br>The crevice was not enough: Enoch simply fished Thrust out of there with a <em>telepathic attack</em>. Thrust, in return, <em>accelerated</em> at Enoch and <em>focused</em> for a tackle, but missed because of Enoch’s <em>time control</em> skill.<br>THROTTLE: “Are you positively sure?”<br>THRUST: “Don’t test my patience, Throttle!!!”<br>The rotating turbine had almost made half a revolution — Azelle was stilled tied to it, screaming in panic and crying for help as the water beneath brushed gently at her fur.<br>THRUST: “Azelle! Throttle, push the button!!”<br>THROTTLE: “You’re not gonna get mad at me if I do?”<br>THRUST: “Just push the dang thing!”<br>Enoch <em>teleported</em> to where Thrust was and delivered a deafening <em>arcane blast</em>, almost knocking him out of consciousness.<br>ENOCH (standing over him): “Now you shut your mouth, you understand? You think a little kit can help you? Well, you’re far from right. And I’m gonna give you a swift and painless death. But hey, look at the bright side: it’ll be painless…”<br><br><br>To push someone's buttons* - this is a slang term for making somebody angry.

                THRUST: “Throttle…push…the…button!”<br>Enoch’s paws was around his neck; he was being choked.<br>For a moment, nothing happened. Throttle looked at Thrust, then at the big, red button…and finally:<br>THROTTLE: <strong>“I’M ALIVE!!!”</strong> *slams the button*<br>The flood gates opened all the way; the water was now free to gush at its will, devastating everything in its path.<br>Enoch looked at the incoming wave: now was the time for Thrust to escape! He overpowered Enoch off of himself and dived down, <em>mutating</em> into his Siwan state as he entered into the water. Luckily, Enoch’s attention was focused at the incoming wave, allowing Thrust to chew the ropes off of Azelle and save her (to which she gave a bashful smile to her hero).<br>The droplets of the tide displayed an ominous* threat to destroyer whoever stood in its way. Enoch activated his <em>time control</em> skill to slow it in its tracks, but he was too late. Just a moment early, Thrust escorted Azelle to dry ground and fired a bolt of electricity at Enoch—at the time that he activated <em>time control</em>. (Lightning travels at the speed of light, so it would be impossible for Enoch to slow it down.)<br>Now he was in trouble: with his concentration thrown off, the monstrous tide crashed on top of him, rendering him almost immobile to fight. But now Thrust had the upper hand, and it was his turn to fight back! First, he tackled Enoch from all sides at great speeds, almost knocking the air out of him. Next, he <em>accelerated</em> in large circles, creating a whirlpool to further confuse his already disoriented opponent. Finally, he mustered his final strength for an <em>absolute zero</em> attack. The whirlpool froze in action and the water stopped gushing in. Everything was now in complete standstill, there were not even any voices in the air.<br>Thrust stood in the eye of the whirlpool. It was like standing at the very center of a tornado, except that it was now a cone-shaped chamber of ice. And with Enoch frozen in there, Thrust reverted to his original form and tried to catch his breath. The battle was a fierce one, but the end result was to his favor…<br>But then, an arcane beam sprang out from the ice below him. A second later, Thrust was feeling dizzy and tired — his energy had been drained out! And out of the humungous block of ice, Enoch broke free, smirking evilly at Thrust.<br>ENOCH: “<em>Weaken</em>: another one of my capabilities. And now, Thrust, it really is time to die.<br>Thrust could not do anything: not even stand on his four paws, let alone perform an electric attack….<br><br><br>Ominous* - describing something that foretells evil, or something bad.

                The Three Korgons facetiously ran as they lampooned* the irritated Nero. Soon, they found a smashed window and jumped through it.

Nero was showering rounds of beams at the bottom of the ice cone. But because of his poor aim, <em>Sher-Kaar beams</em> were slapping down all over the place! Enoch dodged one beam after another while climbing higher up the cone to get a good view of the sirain. The korgons were frantically dodging too, but Thrust, unable to move, just lay there, scrutinizing*** every one of Enoch’s movements. And then…Bingo! As Thrust had hoped, Enoch was now standing right in front of a window that gazed out into the ocean surrounding the Underwater Dome. If he could only force the dark wanwan out through it, it would permanently end the battle!<br>THRUST: “Amigo, look!”<br>Amigo looked up at Enoch and noticed the same advantage.<br>THRUST: “You’ve got to do something to push him out.”<br>AMIGO (looking around the cone): “I’m on it!”<br>Amigo grabbed an ice shard that a <em>Sher-Kaar beam</em> had beaten out of the cone and tilted it at the perfect angle. Then, Nero fired dead straight at Amigo…the beam bounced off the shard…and hit Enoch square in the chest!<br>It worked! The impact forced Enoch out of the Underwater Dome for good! Of course, now water was gushing in again, but that wasn’t much of a problem anymore:<br>NERO: “Oops.” *Uses <em>absolute zero</em> to freeze the water*<br>THRUST: “Thanks a bunch, Nero!”<br>NERO: “What did I do? I was chasing stupid little korgons. No creature ridicules the majesty of a Roman emperor, don’t you know?”<br>AMIGO (satirically): “You were an emperor, now you’re a <strong>sirain!</strong>”<br>NERO: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twisted.gif"><br>AMIGO: “Hey, let’s celebrate and do the Caramel Dansen!

                Final scene to this episode. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><br><br>Later, that night, Thrust and Azelle were fast asleep in T’s sleeping cell, dreaming away their unfinished business:<br>THRUST: “Azelle, Azelle, let down your hair!”<br>AZELLE: “Thrust, I already told you — I cut my hair.”<br>THRUST: -_- “And I was hoping that you’d grow it back.”<br>AZELLE: “Grow it back in a day? Oh please, honey! Even a fool would know that hair doesn’t grow that fast.”<br>THRUST: “This is a dream, for Grandpa Joe’s sake!”<br>AZELLE: “Well, you always have the ladder.”<br>THRUST: “You mean the one with the briar vines?”<br>AZELLE: “Which other?”<br>THRUST (to himself): “I don’t know what I’m gonna do to her: kiss her, or strangle her.”<br>So, like in the previous dream, Thrust climbed the painful course. Only this time, he managed to climb to the top, to his goal.<br>AZELLE: “Oh, Thrust! You’ve come!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/love.gif"><br>THRUST: “Yes, and you have no idea how much that hurt…”<br>AZELLE: “You have been through so much, my dear. I can’t thank you enough for rescuing me. The least I can do is give my warrior his due reward.”<br>At that, she grew closer and closer to him, until he could feel her gentle breath on his face… But then…<br>“Ooh, is this a kissing booth?” said a familiar voice.<br>The two looked down from the tower.<br>THRUST &amp; AZELLE: “Throttle, get out of my dream!!!”<br>THROTTLE: “Hey, don’t look at me like that! I just wanted to watch you two love doves end this boring fairytale scene so that we can get the heck out of here.”<br>THRUST: “It’s the middle of the night in the real world: there’s nothing to do. Now go back to bed!”<br>THROTTLE: “Fine, fine. Sheesh, you don’t have to be such sourpusses. Get it? Sour<strong>puss</strong>? It matches you wanwans.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br>THRUST &amp; AZELLE: <strong>“GET OUT!!!”</strong> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"><br>At that exclamation, Thrust felt himself sinking from Azelle’s sight…then he realized: the briar was snapping beneath his feet!…Again!<br><br>Thrust woke up.<br>THRUST: <u><strong>“THROOOOOTTTTTTLLLLLLEEEEE!!!!!”</strong></u><br><br>THE END =D

                <strong>Episode 3<br><em>Intro:</em></strong><br>A leader’s meeting was being held at the Underwater Dome to discuss a serious situation. T200 commenced it with an opening speech:<br>T200: “Delegated leaders of the Underwater Dome, you’ve all gathered here because there is a serious matter we have to solve.”<br>The leaders at the gathered listened carefully.<br>T200: “First of all, I would like to discuss the changing of our organizations name.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"><br>EVERYBODY: “Awwwwww!!…” &gt;:[<br>1ST LEADER: “Again?”<br>2ND LEADER: “Is this the important issue you wanted to talk about?”<br>3RD LEADER: “I thought we went through this.”<br>4TH LEADER: “We did — the answer is no!”<br>T200: “C’mon, guys. We’re supposed to be a top secret organization, right? And by top secret, I mean top-top secret, so that nobody even knows our name. So if we change our name from HACA to something, we’ll be top secret again.”<br>5TH LEADER: “No.”<br>T200: “Please?”<br>6TH LEADER: “No!”<br>T200: “Double-please?”<br>EVERYBODY: <strong>”NO!!!”</strong> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"><br>T200: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"> … “Fine then. The other issue I wanted to talk about is the totem on Totem Island.”<br>This caught everyone’s attention.<br>T200: “As you all know, the totem, which once guarded the kabukis on that island, somehow came alive and sought to destroy Dinoland. (If you don’t know about this, please read Thrust 2: Treacherous Totem.) We’ve kept this memory in the dark corners of our minds for a couple of years, but now it’s time to bring it into the light and solve it. Benroy.”<br>Benroy curtly waved his two fingers in reply and said, “Yo.”<br>T200: “You and your skill with pteroz will be really handy to us in this operation. Please prepare and me at the assembly station in two hours.”<br>BENROY: “Right on, bro.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif">

And we also know that the Conquerors — our most hated enemies — are behind this. If we can uncover the secrets of the totem, then that will be one giant leap towards saving Dinoland forever.”<br>2ND PERSON: “How will we uncover the secret?”<br>T200: “We’re gonna find out right now. Every one of you who has a pteroz comes with me. The rest stays here to guard the Dome. Move out!”

                Without of word, both humans and dinoz obeyed the order. Every master who owned a pteroz immediately assembled their dinoz and followed T200 and Benroy. Thrust and Azelle ran alongside their master, while Nero and White Veld split up to join theirs. Soon, the platoon was running through a long underwater tunnel until they reached Mutant Falls — the exit station.<br>Troop by troop, then many at a time boarded their pteroz and took off from the mouth of the Falls, like a galaxy of bats soaring out of their cave. Benroy shared his pteroz, named A.C.E., with T200 and his two wanwans. As for Thrust, he looked onward at the horizon as they left the Falls into the open air, wondering what challenges and dangers awaited him and his master at Totem Island, as the wind caressed his yellow fur. But his concentration was disturbed…<br>BOB: “Hola!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br>THRUST: “What the… Guys?”<br>THROTTLE: “Hey, cousin!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br>It was Los Tres Korgons and Throttle.

                Indeed, the voyage was a long one. After many hours of nonstop travelling, the platoon decided on a pit stop at the Coral Mines to refill and recharge. Fortunately (of course), the miners’ hospitality was exceptional. With a superfluity* of food in their hands and water, which could easily be filtered, surrounding the island, the native Atlenteids were eager to show their good will to the HACA.<br><strong>MINER</strong>: “Ey, me ole frien’!”<br>An Atlanteid said to T.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “You? I remember you! You’re the guy who helped me on my first Dinoland quest!”<br><strong>MINER</strong>: “Righ'-o!”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “Who’s this?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Oh, an old acquaintance of mine who helped in save Dinoland from the 2nd War.”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “I meant what’s his name.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Uhhh…” O_o<br><strong>MINER</strong>: “No worries. Jus’ call me any name you like.”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “In that case, can I call you—”<br><strong>T200</strong> (interrupting): “Benroy! Let’s not go any further from here. So, um, Mr. miner, do you mind giving us a little tour around this place while we’re recharging for our next trip?”<br><strong>MINER</strong>: “O’ course. Firs’ off, you see dat stat’ ovr’ dere?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Sure do.”<br>Thrust, Azelle, Los Tres Korgons, Throttle, and Nero and White Veld came over to join the excursion of a large, buffed up, Hercules of a statue.<br><strong>MINER</strong>: “Dat dere is te memorial of me minin’ idol. ‘E was te bes’ of te miners. One day, I wan’ to be as buff as ‘e iz, an’ I’ll become te bes’ of te miners alongside ‘im. Eh, look at me now—I’m almos’ as buff az ‘e!”<br>The group looked at the miner’s skinny legs, arms, and body, then looked at the unrealistically muscular statute of the figure. Almost as buff?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong> (at the statue): “Yup, he’s on steroids.”

                After the pit stop, the platoon immediately took flight, and after several more hours of travelling, Totem Island was in the horizon.<br><strong>T200</strong> (shouting): “Yes. We’re almost there, guys!”<br>As the small landscape drew closer, a sudden realization struck T:<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Oh, shoot! I forgot the aura!”<br>But he didn’t need it…for a strange reason.<br>The disorienting clouds, which should have been surrounding the island, were not there. Instead of a mist that could deviate the human mind, there was nothing but the sun in your eyes and the scent of salt water from below.<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “What’s going on?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “I don’t know, and I don’t like a bit of it.”<br>Nevertheless, the whole platoon moved on. When they landed, they found the island to be mysteriously empty. They searched everywhere: from every bush to every tree to the plains and to the beaches — but not a single life was present. As for the totem that used to rule over the island from its bull’s-eye, all it was now was a lifeless stone, whereas before you could feel the aura of the kabuki spirits all around it.<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “Strange. Utterly strange…”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Ever since the totem’s revolt, it’s turned into this. But what does this mean?”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “Trouble. Nothing but trouble, I tell ya. I suspect this is all but a trap to deceive us, and maybe even take us into captivity while the Conquerors do their dirty work.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Not so fast with the conclusions, Ben. There could be thousands — no — millions of reasons why the totem is in the state it is. And what about the kabukis? There’s nothing left.”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “Look, you ponder this junk on your own — it was your idea all along. I’m taking my troops back to the Dome.”<br><strong>T200</strong> (insulted): “Benroy! I’m the head of authority here!”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “Okay, sorry. But I warn ya — there’s no reason why a whole platoon of 50 pteroz-riders should investigate one little scene.”<br>T thought of this for a moment. Benroy was right. It was a waste to drag 50 dinoz-masters to investigate something that might not have been worth investigating.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Well, I guess you’re right. You lead everybody back to the Dome. I’ll stay here with Bruno and Buro and there dinoz as well as mine.”<br>That they did…

                They watched the fleeting platoon disappear into the horizon. For no particular reason, T began to feel exactly what Benroy had anticipated. But when a hissing sounds, like nothing T had ever heard or heard of, issued from behind him, he realized that his “6th sense” was true.<br>The remainder of the platoon looked at the totem: it was glowing in emerald light that grew brighter and brighter until every one could feel the kabuki aura from within it.<br>Then, without warning…<strong>BANG!!!</strong>…the lot fell unconscious…<br><br><strong>T200</strong> (moaning): “Uhhh…where am I?”<br><strong>BRUNO</strong>: “T, are you awake?”<br><strong>BURO</strong>: “Of course he’s awake!

How long have you guys’ve been up?”<br><strong>BRUNO</strong>: “For half an hour.”<br><strong>BURO</strong>: “And look where we are now.”<br>They were in a tent. T200 and the other two were each on a sleeping mattress. Looking around more carefully, T noticed that they were in a big tent that was divided in half by a single, white curtain. Then he looked at the ground, which was bare, and noticed the dark soil and blades of grass.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “We’re not in the Atlantein region, are we?”<br>The two shrugged for answers.<br><em>But of course!</em> thought T. <em>Totem Island doesn’t have dark soil.

I'm going to use 6th Sense in the story, but I'm not sure about Epiphany yet.<br><br><br>In through the curtain came a young nurse, wearing a pink gown and a white apron, and her eyes were wide and blue; so blue, in fact, that you could describe it as the color of lightning.<br><strong>ANNA</strong> (sympathetically): “Oh, you poor dinoz! Here, take this (handing them some medicine). You’ll feel better after an hour.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Lads, I know I’ve met many senoritas in my life, but — U-la-la!!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/redface.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/love.gif"><br><strong>AMIGOS</strong>: “You say that about every pretty senorita that passes by.”<br>Thrust tried to ask the young nurse where they were and how they had gotten there, but all she could here from him were ‘meow’s, to which she giggled cutely. Amigo (the supposed translator) was no help either: he was all gaga for the nurse…<br>She walked to the other side of the tent, where the dinoz’s masters were. Immediately, Bruno and Buro fell for her.<br><strong>BRUNO</strong>: “Whoa! Allow me to introduce myself, miss.”<br><strong>BURO</strong>: “No! Me first!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Guys! Be quiet!”<br>The two silenced at once.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “I’m sorry about Bruno and Buro. Please carry on with your work.”<br><strong>ANNA</strong>: “Thanks! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"> I’m Anna Tommy.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “I’m T, and you already know these two. May I ask you where we are?”<br><strong>ANNA</strong>: “Sure, you’re in the Dinotown Clinic.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Clinic? I’ve never heard of a clinic in Dinotown.”<br><strong>ANNA</strong>: “Well, it’s not a clinic yet… You see, it’s my dream to start the very first health center of Dinoland. I’ve even got permission from the government to start one, but I haven’t the resources the build one, and I’m not rich enough to buy them.”<br><strong>BRUNO</strong>: “That sounds serious!”<br><strong>BURO</strong>: “We’ll get into it right away!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Mouths shut, men!”<br>Their mouths shut at once.<br><strong>ANNA</strong>: “It’d be splendid if you could help!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “It would, wouldn’t it. But I’m sorry to say that we are already on a mission.”<br><strong>BRUNO</strong>: “Aw, c’mon, T!”<br><strong>BURO</strong>: “Yea!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Shut! We have to do what we have to do. In fact, since I’m feeling alright now, thanks to Anna, I think we should go now.”<br><strong>ANNA</strong>: “Oh please help me! I really need this clinic!”<br>At that, she noticed the badge of T’s jacket. She jumped upon spotting it, then cracked a banana grin and almost shrieked.<br><strong>ANNA</strong>: “OMG!!! Are you an HACA member?!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Uhh, yea…”<br><strong>ANNA</strong>: “Oh my goodness! I’ve heard so much about you from my brother!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “He knows about us?”<br><strong>ANNA</strong>: “He writes to me every day from the Underwater Dome.

                The team got up the next morning. They started with day with some breakfast (which, unfortunately, tasted like dung, since Anna Tommie was a medic, and not a cook) and then left to do the job.<br><strong>ANNA</strong> (flirtingly): “Take care, noble heroes!”<br>Bruno and Buro both felt like the sky-high heavens upon hearing that, and it annoyed me. Amigo couldn’t take his eyes off of her either, but at least Amigos was there to take care of him.<br>However, we were all still feeling very sleepless and giddy, since it was very early in the morning (4 o’clock was the time when we got up O.o), so we decided to purchase a newspaper from a nearby kiosk. Well, as you might have suspected — nothing interesting was on…except…<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Hey, look! They’re having a Thrust lookalike competition. Whichever dino most closely resembles Thrust, wins a check worth 10,000 coins. Wow, Thrust, you sure are popular after all that you’ve done to Dinoland!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br>Yea, nothing interesting at all… -_-<br>T200 scrunched the paper up and threw it in the trash bin.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “The only dino that can win such a competition is another wanwan that looks exactly like Thrust.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Or a dino that used Thrust’s old body that we gave to charity, remember?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “No.”<br> <strong>AMIGO</strong>: “In <em>Thrust 2: Treacherous Totem</em>, where you traded Thrust’s old body with his new siwan body and switched minds with it. Remember?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Oh yea! Now I remember. But that was almost a year ago.”<br><strong>BRUNO</strong>: “No time to talk now. We’ve got to find ourselves some disguises so that the police won’t notice us.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “For once, you said something that made sense.”<br>Off they did to acquire disguises…

                A little update on the UD Series (which you might now really care about): I'm changing the narration to 1st person, so "I" will be narrating the story. Here's a nother chunk of the episode.<br><br><br>After stealing a few outfits from the drycleaner’s, we proceeded to the scrapheap yard to look for some usable material. Well, Bruno and Buro objected, but I couldn’t see what the problem was with building a clinic using chunks of rusted metal. (O_o) So we decided to debate the issue: the two wanted to build “little miss teenybopper’s*” health center using good old brick and mortar while I preferred the cheap source of the junkyard; so we ended up compromising — we resorted to glass: not too expensive and not as much of a burden as bricks.<br>After the trash heap, we went off to find a manufacturer of glass that would provide us with their goods at a reasonable price. But, every factory owner we met was a scrooge… T.T<br>Hours had gone by, and we agreed to stop for a lunch break. During this time, I bought another newspaper, just to keep me occupied while waiting for the other two, daydreaming away as they ate their meal by bits (which was annoying). However, there was nothing to look at, except maybe the lookalike competition, which had just ended.<br>But then, I noticed that several public eyes had their attention on us. For a moment, I didn’t understand why, but then it came to me, when a handful of those people approached us with an unusual excitement…<br><strong>1ST PERSON</strong>: “O-M-G! You’re the master of the lookalike champ!”<br><strong>2ND PERSON</strong>: “Wow! I can’t believe I’m talking to you!”<br><strong>3RD PERSON</strong>: “Can I have your autograph?”<br>Actually, they were asking for autographs from me and Thrust as well (with his paws, that is). Despite our polite refusal, people came pouring in like a flock of vultures around a fallen carcass. We were quite literally being sandwiched between fanatic dino-lovers who mistook us for the champions of that stupid lookalike contest. I could image my dinoz struggling to breathe under the pressure of brainless people (no offense), and I felt for them. I was tempted to tell them that we were not the participants that they were looking for, but that would give away our secret identity. But finally, I could take it no longer: my temper was reaching its peak, and, without warning of myself, I burst with a roar:<br><strong>T200</strong>: “We’re not the champs! We’re the real deal!!!” Big mistake…<br>The next thing we all new, we were standing face to face with the police. O_O<br><br><br>Teenybopper* - a slang term for a young teenage girl

                Now we were behind bars…<br><strong>BRUNO</strong>: “Nice job, you freakin’ psychopath.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/evil.gif"><br><strong>BURO</strong>: “Yea, now we’ll never build the clinic!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Is the clinic all you’re worried about?”<br>As far as I was concerned, I never wanted to build the clinic; I only agreed because I was “mentally forced” when Anna said that her brother was Benroy, so I didn’t consider this as my problem. All I wanted to do was unveil the mystery of the kabuki totem, and not get involved in a family matter. However, Los Tres Korgons and the other dinoz thought otherwise, with their vile stares at me.<br>A few minutes later, the cops that arrested us started asking us personal questions: what our names were, our age, position in the HACA, and so forth. Bruno and Buro spoke truthfully, but they did not give away sensitive information (thank goodness). When it was my turn to talk, I replied accordingly: <br><strong>COP</strong>: “Name?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Benroy Tomie.”<br><strong>COP</strong>: “I thought it was T200.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Forget T! It’s Benroy Tomie!”<br><strong>COP</strong>: “Okay then. Age?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Three.”<br><strong>COP</strong>: “…”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Listen, just get it over with!”<br><strong>COP</strong>: “Position?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Noob.”<br><strong>COP</strong>: “Oh, so is that what they call new crew members in your cult?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Yes, they do; and no, we’re not a cult!”<br><strong>COP</strong>: “Okay, thank you.” (Leaves)<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “What was that, senor?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “I can’t give away my true identity as leader of our ‘cult’; plus it serves Benroy right — age 3, noobie position — how could he sign his contract and not say that he had a retarded little sister?! I’m so gonna skin his neck when we get out of here!”<br>But that was the problem — getting out…

                Finally, the time arrived. I quickly hid Thrust under my jacket and hoped that the wardens would not notice, as they clipped the collars onto White Veld, Nero, Azelle, Throttle, Los Tres Korgons (who tried to fight back, but to no avail), and the fake Thrust. After that, we were led into an underground passage. It was dark and gloomy; you could almost not see a thing. The only sources of light were the dim lanterns and candlesticks, but even that could not warn you of a protruding rock that you might trip on at any moment. However, I kept my calm, because I knew that we would be out in no time when the moment was given to us.<br>The walk was long, much longer than I had anticipated, and I was starting to feel weak and tired due to the lack of air in the tunnel and the rocky floor (I could almost swear that I felt them moving O_O).<br><strong>WARDEN</strong>: “We’re halfway at the mining sight.”<br>This made me shiver from within. We were only halfway there, and I was already feeling fatigued by all the walking and shortness of breath. In such an atmosphere, it would be difficult to execute my escape plan, and I didn’t need any proof to figure that out.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “How’re you guys doin’?”<br>But the warden hit me on my head with his club, indicating that communication was forbidden. In return, the others nodded to me when I snuck a glance at them. they were alright, they signed, but I could tell that they were feeling the same effect of the tunnel as I did.<br>Deeper and deeper we went into the cavern: and the deeper we went, the thinner the air grew. I noticed how the guard donned their masks to maintain a level breathing. But as for us, their prisoners, they didn’t care more. Now I was feeling dizzy; I was feeling weak. From time to time, my vision turned blurry. And when I looked up from my last session of blurriness, I found, in my depression, that the cave was going deeper still.<br>Suddenly, it came to me. I remembered that we, as an organization, were the most wanted people of the Dinoland Police, and the punishment for the most wanted was always the same — capital. There was no mine for us down there, only a slow and breathless death…<br>I could take it no more!<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Thrust! <strong><em>flash wave!!</em></strong><br>Thrust jumped out of my jacket at the surprised guards and zapped them to unconsciousness. Then, out of pure instinct, we went for the wardens’ breathing masks and yanked them off of their faces to don on ourselves, and then snapped the collars off of our dinoz. But then, as if out of the blue, the ground started to rise: a brigade of rockies were surrounding us in that narrow corridor. I should’ve known that the ground was actually just that. Nevertheless, we were giving in without a fight.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Thrust, use <strong><em>focus!</em></strong>, and Azelle, <em><strong>lightning dance!!</strong></em>”<br><strong>BRUNO</strong>: “White Veld, <strong><em>colossus!!</em></strong>”<br><strong>BURO</strong>: “Nero, <strong><em>cold shower!!</em></strong>”<br>The orders were given. The corridor was now fraught in the confusion of dinoz using elemental skills. Lightning from the rockies and my two wanwans flashed all over the place while water showered down from the ceiling, making this even worse. However, I was really impressed with how White Veld’s <em>growth</em> skill made him grow to three times his regular size! He was like a raging giant smashing live rocks with his bare hands. Then, when Bruno ordered him to go <em>giant</em>, White Veld grew to five time his regular size. Man, that made my day: watching how a 5-ton gorilloz own the place with his raw size and muscle power was a satisfaction in itself.<br>However the number of rockies did not seem to decrease. More and more of them started popping out of the ground…and we were losing our breath more and more…

                Luckily, White Veld’s artificial growth was a huge advantage for us. With one fortunate blow, he knocked out no less than 15 rockies, allowing us a safe passage back to the surface for a short time (the rockies kept using <em>leafy dawn</em> on themselves). And by the time we had made it, the breathing masks were insufficient for usage anymore; we discarded them and took in a deep breath of fresh air. However, our situation only regressed*…<br>At the entrance to our could-have-been grave stood Chief Garland—my key nemesis of the Dinoland Police Academy. From behind me, I could hear White Veld still crushing live rocks with his altered muscles, but right in front of me stood the man who wished me death on the spot; just looking at him drowned the commotion of fighting in the background.<br><strong>GARLAND</strong> (clapping): “Bravo, bravo. You never fail to impress me.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Oh, God. Not you again.”<br><strong>GARLAND</strong>: “You know, we’ve been looking for you ever since you started your illegal criminal organization. But I never thought that you’d come to me; it just makes things so easier.<br>Anyway, let’s get to the point.”<br>Thrust took a defensive wanwan posture and ejected sparks of lightning out of his fur, but Garland ignored him and continued.<br><strong>GARLAND</strong>: “I can’t stop you right out. I know I can’t. And I can’t stand seeing a masterpiece of a criminal like you dying a dull death.”<br>I couldn’t help but grind my teeth every time that idiot chief called me a criminal, because that’s not what I was. Garland still continued…<br><strong>GARLAND</strong>: “So let’s settle our scores the old fashioned way: a duel. T, I challenge one of your dinoz to duke it out with my gorilloz here, Thaller (indicating his orange gorilloz who stood obediently by his side). If you win, we will release you from this prison for the time being. But if you lose, you will surrender yourselves completely without resistance. In case you lose and do resist, your death with be imminent…”<br>That was true, as I could see from the guards’ dinoz surrounding him, all charging up with an elemental power with the potential to kill.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Alright, challenge accepted.”<br><strong>GARLAND</strong>: “Fascinating. Your choice of dueler will be Thrust, no doubt.”<br>Ha! That’s not what I had in mind. I looked at Thrust, who still had his ominous eyes gazing at Garland, and then at Thaller, who stepped forward while pounding on his chest to advertise his power. I knew Thrust was not strong enough, after all that fighting in the air-devoid cavern, but I also knew that there was someone who was strong enough.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “It’s not Thrust I’m choosing.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Meow?” [What?]<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Bruno, would you like to do the honors?”<br><strong>BRUNO</strong>: “Whatever you say. White Veld, <strong>battle station!!!</strong>”<br>White Veld smashed through the narrow entrance with a deafening roar! The battle commenced!

                <strong>GARLAND</strong> (calmly): “So, looks like we’re having a clash of the titans. Thaller, <strong><em>colossus!!</em></strong>”<br>The chief didn’t seem to care that White Veld was five times his own gorilloz’s size in his giant state. With Garland’s order, Thaller grew to <strong>10 times</strong> his regular size, easily outweighing White Veld!<br><strong>BRUNO</strong>: “Then we’ll play the same game! WV, use <strong><em>colossus</em></strong> too!”<br>White Veld grew in size again, but he only managed to grow to seven times his regular size; and although White Veld was relatively larger than Thaller (without the alteration skills), Garland’s Gorolloz was still the dominant in mass.<br><strong>BRUNO</strong>: “Don’t let size intimidate you, White Veld. Quick! Deliver the first punch!”<br>But Bruno was giving away too much with his mouth. Without even needing his master’s signal, Thaller caught the incoming punch as if snatching a child’s fist, and twisted it, throwing White Veld into the air and landed him on the ground with a huge SLAM!!!<br>But that did not stop with white gorilloz of the HACA. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"><br>Time and time again, Thaller continued to thwart White Veld’s every attempt of attack. Garland could not help but cackle evilly at this sight, and we, in return, couldn’t think of anything more divine than punching him in the face. But we restrained from doing that, or else we would get our reward. But what caught my mind was at how masterful Thaller was at controlling the situation. I could understand that he was the bigger bully in this duel, but I could not understand how White Veld could not deliver even a single puny blow. And not only that, but White Veld was too many times losing his balance, and not because of Thaller, but something else. Something was not right. Something had to be out of place.<br>But then I saw it: the sneaky little bastard… It was a wanwan of one of the guards: it was playing a little trick with its vines under White Veld’s feet without him noticing. Originally, I had hoped that Bruno’s dino would pull it off and win us our freedom, but now I found another way.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Hey! Garland!! You tricky son of a softpig!!”<br>This sent a shock wave to the deceitful chief.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “If you can cheat, we can cheat as well. Thrust and Azelle! Sic ‘em!!”<br>My two wanwan immediately jumped into action, and so did Nero and Los Tres Korgons. The guards’ dinoz leaped into action as well, and a big battle started, with Thaller and White Veld as the main picture. Throttle was tugging on the sleeves of my pants, begging me to send him into battle too, though I knew that he was still just a kitten for that kind of hardship. So I took him in my arms and stroked his fur, which he deeply resented with a wanwan-ish growl.<br>The battle was in favor of us, thanks to our specially trained dinoz. However, Thaller was beating hard on White Veld — I had to take the initiative to save him.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Thrust! Zap Thaller in the eyes!”<br>Thrust did so: he ruthlessly sent a <em>lightning attack</em> right into the eyes of the <em>colossus</em> gorilloz, and sent him taking a few steps back. This gave me the opportunity to dilever the final blow.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Alright! Now bite him on the throat!”<br><cite>Right after this point, the story becomes too graphic, violent, and gory, and I therefore cannot wright further than this. Let’s just say that after the battle, Thaller went to dino heaven forevermore. O.o</cite>

                Alright, I'm back with the final chunk of this episode. Enjoy! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br><br>Long story short: after the battle, Garland still refused to let us go. But thanks to our dinoz reigning supreme, we easily kicked his heinie and got the heck out of there. The sad part was that we then returned to Anna Tomie empty-handed. I had quit working for his teenybopper, seeing all the tribulations we had gone through for nothing.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Sorry, Anna. We can’t do anything to help.”<br><strong>ANNA</strong>: “Oh, that’s okay. I already have built the clinic.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>She showing us the completed clinic, that oddly looked like a dome from underwater.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “You…what?”<br><strong>ANNA</strong>: “Yea, my brother, Benroy, sent me some material from your home base. How kind of him.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “He did what?!?!” <br><strong>ANNA</strong>: “Yea, I know. He’s a very thoughtful person. He always thinks about other people’s needs and then rushes to answer their calls. He’s very altruistic in that sense.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twisted.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twisted.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twisted.gif"><br><strong>ANNA</strong>: “Thank you for offering me your help, thought.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br>I couldn’t take it any more.<br><strong>T200</strong>: <strong>“Look here, miss!! You don’t know what we had to go through to help you with your dumb clinic!! We’ve nearly been killed, for goodness sake, and you just sit here like a little pretty princess in a pink gown, sipping you tea!! I’ve had enough!! Enough, I tell ya! We’re getting’ outta here!! I hope to never see you again!!”</strong> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"><br>I could’ve sworn I was swearing as I shouted.<br><strong>ANNA</strong>: “Wow…someone’s getting a little tense, hehe. And it’s actually Mrs., not miss.”<br><strong>BRUNO, BURO &amp; AMIGO</strong>: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/eek.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><br><strong>T200</strong>: “Well nobody cares! Goodbye!”<br>We were about to leave when Anna stopped us in our tracks, much to my resentment.<br><strong>ANNA</strong>: “Wait! I do have something to give you.”<br>She handed us a bottle of medical pills with a label saying <em>Get Better Instantly</em>.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “What the heck is this, Mrs. Tricky?”<br><strong>ANNA</strong> (giggling): “You’re funny. It’s a medicine I created myself. One pill can cure any kind of illness instantaneously. It’s not much, but it’s something.”<br>Well, I guesses it really was better than nothing; plus I had to control my anger. I took the pill with a curt “Thank you” and we left to book a room in a hotel in Dinoplaza to stay fro the night.<br>Later on that night…<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Well, what an amazingly terrifying and life-threatening day that was. Eh, senor?”<br><strong>AMIGOS</strong>: “You say you want to do it again?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “No, no, I’m just commenting.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “I’m just glad it’s all over. When we get back, I’m gonna give that Benroy a good whipping for dismantling part of our underwater base.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Hey, let’s not get into any fight, no? Let’s just sit back, relax, and watch some TV.”<br>Amigo clicked the remote control and turned on the TV. I, Thrust, Azelle, Throttle, and the other two with Bruno and Buro all aid back to enjoy the late night show.<br><br>THE END.

                You'll see. It'll be of some use to the gang in the next episode (which I will probably post after the championship, depending on how long it will last).<br><br><strong>Ghastly Presence</strong><br>This is a level 4 S skill that stems after Time Control. When the dino is in battle, the enemies' defense drops by 5 points in all elements. In th story, this is an illusionary skill that Enoch uses to scare his enemies.

                Thanks for the support, guys. Even though I'm a little sick right now, it's only temporary. The next episode will arrive shortly.<br><br>Also, I have an announcement to make. In about a month or so, it will be Thrust's birthday (that is the day I first published stories of Thrust in the Chaos Tavern). Unfortunately, I don't know exactly when it is, because the first ever thread of Thrust's Tale was erased by a deranged moderator (who, thankfully, has been "un-coronated" the King of the Chaos Tavern long ago). So I'm deciding which date to celebrate it. I'm open for ideas, though. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>Have a great Championship and a Happy Halloween!

                Okay, so the third and final episode of "What It's Like to Be a Dino" is here. <a href="http://en.dinorpg.com/cinema/660/view" target="_blank">http://en.dinorpg.com/cinema/660/view</a><br>Enjoy! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>Also, I'm thinking of making a Paradino version of the Under-Dome Series. Of course, that would mean the plot will be slightly different (due to Paradino's limitations). Basically, it will simply be about a random group of dinoz trying trying to save the world, but always end up looking like the bad guys. If I do attempt a movie version UD Series, rest assured that I will still be writing the original story here.<br><br>That'll be all for now. Good luck with the Champs, guys! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif">

                Okay, episode four is here.<br>But before I get into it, let just tell you a little bit about that mod. While he was in power, he did all sorts of abusive things, like deleting people's comments for no reason, banning people unfairly, and doing other misdeeds that got his whole account permanently banned. I remember he even banned my account from the forum for a ridiculous length of time and erased the original thread of Thrust's stories. Luckily, he didn't last long after MT found out that he was misusing his power, and everything else is history.<br>Now here's the opening...<br><br><br>Back at the Underwater Dome…<br><strong>MAD MOD</strong>: “Muahaha! Finally! After all these months, I’ve been liberated from the abyss of shame and humiliation. The time to exact my revenge has come. The community of Dino RPG will fall in the hands of Honorus!”<br><strong>LOLWHUT</strong> (tied in ropes): “You won’t get away with this!”<br><strong>MAD MOD</strong>: “Oh I won’t, will I? You and your pathetic friends have done me the most unforgivable thing that could happen to a mod!”<br><strong>LOLWHUT</strong>: “You’re the only one responsible for your mess!”<br><strong>MAD MOD</strong>: “Don’t be foolish! Un-coronating me as the King of CT was the worst crime made in all of human history!”<br><strong>LOLWHUT</strong>: “Oh, please! You couldn’t handle that position correctly. In fact, you misused it!”<br><strong>MAD MOD</strong>: “Silence! Now, with HACA’s base fallen under my reign, there will be no stopping the Conquerors’ will. Thanks to his majesty, Honorus, I have regained my power as King of CT and eventually I will rule all of Dino RPG by eliminating every single mod, one by one!”<br><strong>LOLWHUT</strong>: “You won’t!”<br><strong>MAD MOD</strong>: “I will!!”<br>The Mad Mod snapped his fingers, and Lolwhut disappeared with a loud pop. He banned her.<br><strong>MAD MOD</strong>: “No one can stop the tide of Mod MMBMC!!!”

                Saying it like that kind of makes me feel awkward, but you do have a point, he did turn a bit weird. I got kinda tired of it so I eventially just stoped going on the forum. In fact I didnt even know he wasnt a mod anymore untill about a month or so ago.

Bad news!”<br>Benroy clicked on the remote control and turned the news on.<br><strong>REPORTER</strong>: “This is Dinoland News and I am your reporter for today. On Saturday last week, the Underwater Dome had been overthrown by a mysterious character whom we have no information of, except that he addresses himself as “Mad Mod”. Officials are unaware whether this will affect anything pertaining to Dinoland in anyway. However, Chief Garland of the Dinoland Police Academy says, ‘This is a great achieve for the elimination of the criminalist HACA movement. More information must be gathered on this new, courageous hero of Dinoland!’”<br><strong>EVERYBODY</strong>: “WTH?!?!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “That Garland dork doesn’t know when to quit!”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Man, he’s so stupid! Even more than me!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"><br><strong>AMIGOS</strong>: &lt;_&lt;<br><strong>BOB</strong>: “I’m stupid too!” XD<br><strong>AMIGO &amp; AMIGOS</strong>: &gt;_&gt;<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Benroy, by any chance, do you know the name of that intruder?”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “Well…I do…I’ve worked for him once, actually…but I can’t tell you.”<br><strong>T200</strong> (frustrated): “Why the hell not?!”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “Umm…you see…whenever somebody says his name out loud, they get banned out of existence.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “What kind of gibberish is that?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “What’s his name, senor?”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “I can’t tell you! It’s Mad Mod!”<br><strong>BOB</strong>: “Mod who?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: <strong>“Mod MMBMC!!!”</strong><br>Poof! *banned*<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Hey, where the heck did he go?<br>EVERYBODY: -.-<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Right… Men!

                Thanks for all your support. Now, referring to the Championships, my clan has won its first battle.

                <strong><u>Thrust 2.5: The Battle of a Thousand Clans</u></strong><br><strong>Part 1: Into the Void</strong><br><em>Chapter 2</em><br><br>The advent of sunrise did not start with breakfast, comments of ‘good morning’s or other such postulated luxuries. Every one of my clan mates were bellicose and Spartan-like, they weren’t the people whom once knew. As for the battlefield — it was a void with only empty dreams and the breath of death. Here, every blade of grass to the fateful gulp of air was the property of the reaper, if I may put it that way. It was the kind of chill running down your spine that made you reflect upon your life and appreciate every remaining moment of dear life; inasmuch (and notwithstanding) you had to convert to a barbaric habit to maximize your chance to live. Having the said explanations in mind, the four of us prepared to battle to the end (if that was necessary).<br>   Suddenly — a wakeup call! — the horns of the opposing clan sounded the start of the battle. And as suddenly as that sound blasted, our clan engaged into a rushing paroxysm, virtually transforming into a tidal wave of human and dino corps with a force equal to a natural tide. In this scenario, you’d have to be alert at all times, because I wasn’t. My body was tossed all around and it was only after a few brutal moments’ time that I could muster up my awareness and chant our clan’s battle cry with my “tomb-mates”. Only one thing was missing — Thrust! We were separated from the forceful stampede! Our struggles to pull ourselves towards each other proved futile. Like a painful farewell, the struggling Thrust slowly vanished form my sight, and there was no way I could return to him without abandoning my dedication to the clan. The only dinoz I had remaining were Mistral and Nero. I had no choice, so I wished Thrust a good luck wherever he was in the vast battlefield and charged on.<br><br>As for Thrust, he looked on to where I had disappeared beyond the horizon, and then charged on towards to opposing dinoz…

                <strong><u>Thrust 2.5: The Battle of a Thousand Clans</u></strong><br><strong>Part 1: Into the Void</strong><br><em>Chapter 3</em><br>The battle was fierce. It no longer felt like a Championship. This gargantuan arena had <br>momentarily turned into a den of gladiators confined in interior prisons of bloodlust for a savage victory as the two armies clashed at the very center of the field. Neither side was willing to concede: to some it was for precious life that coursed their veins, but for most it was the title of triumphant and the degradation of the foe. Never before had I witnessed such brutality, not even in the Clan Wars, where the battlefields were hardly a quarter of the size of this. And so I hesitated to help myself in the massacre. But I carried on my task...my best, anyhow, although I doubted that my assistance was of any significance to our cause.<br>   That night, we fixed up our tents and campfires well away from our adversaries who likewise did the same. This, without speculation, was the perfect time to treat our dinoz’s wounds and tend to our own worldly petty concerns. Once, I overheard somebody complaining about being dragged into this hell on earth, while someone else grumbled over his destitute situation. Many lacked first aid to heal their dinoz, and I even heard rumors that some rebellious teammates were nicking equipment from right under their comrades’ noses. Me — yes — I had my own temporal woes, but what haunted me most was my concern for Thrust.

                <strong><u>Thrust 2.5: The Battle of a Thousand Clans</u></strong><br><strong>Part 1: Into the Void</strong><br><em>Chapter 4</em><br>A war counsel was held that same night. I wasn’t a part of it, I probably was not qualified enough, but I could hear their faint discussions through the fabric of the tent: our leader was gathering a handful of our warriors to launch a midnight attack on the opposing camp. The timing was perfect too, as I noticed the lights of blue team were all gone. Of course, after the counsel would be over, the attendees would not be thrilled about my slippery business, so I hurriedly crawled back to my post and fought my way to sleep.<br>   I had a dream that night, but it felt so real. It was not the kind of mare that you could manipulate: here, everything was so graphic. I could see our platoon on their nightshift mission. They spread out and stalked silently like a pride of lions of the verge of a kill. Few by few, I perceived them and their dinoz entering into enemy tents, then coming out with a symbolic bloodstain in their sullen glances. When the sun made its first touchdown of the brand new day, our adversaries woke...amidst an ominous morning...<br>   All of a sudden, I was no longer in my dream. The young sun was shining through my tent, and the cool breeze tickled my dinoz out of their slumber. But what forced us into our full senses was an invasion into my privacy by one of our commanders (who bellowed at us to wake up!). When we did abandon our tent (which we did as promptly as we could) I could not believe my eyes. My dream was the reality! Our enemies were in full retreat, and we were in hot pursuit. My faith in my clan was restored! We charged on with full pride and confidence in our victory!

                <strong><u>Thrust 2.5: The Battle of a Thousand Clans</u></strong><br><strong>Part 1: Into the Void</strong><br><em>Chapter 5</em><br>Such turn of fortune! We had pushed our opponents back to their starting line. Without delay, we delivered our whole army to surround them and claim our steady victory.<br>   Unlike our starting position, theirs was shrouded in mist. You could not see further than three paces away from yourself. I could not even distinguish my cloudoz from the atmosphere! Luckily, Mistral used his lightning element to illuminate himself, allowing me to spot him and clear our surroundings a bit. Despite the fog, the whole of me was excited with enthusiasm, but I was overflowing with overconfidence. Without even thinking, I dashed forward with my two dinoz straight for the enemies’ foundational territory. My only aim was to wipe out the opposing team for the clan and I was certain to myself that I would achieve it! But novice me — I had no clue to what I was doing!<br>   “T, get out of there!” shouted the voice of our leader.<br>   I stopped in my tracks: I could not disobey the clan leader.<br>   “Leave that place immediately! You are too far from us to receive aid!”<br>   The last sentence struck me! We had drifted too far from the main body of our army! How could I be so incompetent as to do this?<br>   Before I could turn around to make the retreat, we found ourselves surrounded by stray eyes. They glared at us, then the glow subsided as they unveiled themselves form the murky curtains: a santaz and two wanwans. And accompanying them was a voice of the opposing army, an ominous, foreboding omen:<br>   “Straying away, are we?” said the master of the voice.<br>   And the next thing I knew, Mistral and Nero were taken out in a flash! I could do little to save them, so I retreated on my own, with much reluctance, towards the direction where I heard my leader. It was at that moment that the image of Thrust began to haunt me again.

                Okay, guys. This is T200 using this account. In actuality, it's my friends account, but he let me use it temporarily since he doesn't play anymore. Apparently, I can't post more than 4 consecutive posts in one thread, although it didn't used to be that way before. So I'm using my friend's account to break that barrier so that I can continue posting. And now because of this new system, you're gonna have to wait for <em>Thrust 2.5</em> until I'm done posting episode 4 of the UD Series.<br>Happy reading! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif">

                Thanks for that, Lolwhut. And just to reassure my skeptical readers (if I have any), that post above *was* me. So no biggie...for as long as I don't get banned for this. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br><br><br><strong>MMBMC</strong> (dancing out of joy): “<strong>MWAHAHAHA!!!</strong> I cannot subdue my elation!

Who’re you?”<br><strong>TOOTHPICK</strong>: “Toothpick’s the name, and I pick teeth! Just kidding! You suck! (like me <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif">) <strong>M-M-B-M-C!!!</strong> Ha!” XD<br><strong>MMBMC</strong>: “How is that supposed to be funny?”<br><strong>ENOCH</strong>: “Yea, and why didn’t my <em>sixth sense</em> sense you coming?”<br><strong>TOOTHPICK</strong>: “Geez! You should take a look on your faces: ‘I didn’t sense that one coming!’”<br><strong>MMBMC</strong>: “He should be banned for saying my name by now!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/evil.gif"><br><strong>TOOTHPICK</strong>: “Aww, c’mon!

                All around MMBMC’s room were crates and barrels behind which Thrust and co. hid. Thrust used Morse code by tapping his claws on the floor to signal the others of the ambush timing. Everybody was situated on an equal distance between each other on a circumference with the Mad Mod as the center point.<br>The timing was clear, and they were about to take the leap when:<br><strong>ENOCH</strong>: “Peek-a-boo!”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “What in the name of...”<br><strong>ZAP!!!</strong><br>Enoch used an <em>arcane beam</em> to blast the everybody out of hiding!<br><strong>MMBMC</strong> (turning to the group then back to Toothpick): “So, you’ve been working under cover!”<br><strong>TOOTHPICK</strong>: “Oh not me, it was them. Ha!” XD<br><strong>MMBMC</strong>: -.- “I don’t know how all of you got out of Ban-Land, so this time I won’t just ban you — I will erase your accounts!”<br><strong>EVERYBODY</strong>: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><strong>O_O</strong><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><br><strong>MMBMC</strong>: “So long, do-gooders!”<br>MMBMC was about to snap his fingers, but surprisingly, he was distracted by Throttle tugging viciously on his leg with the wanwan’s teeth.<br><strong>MMBMC</strong>: “Get off, you mangy feline!”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: *Good work, Throttle!* “Sic ‘em, guys!”<br>At that, Thrust leaped on Enoch while Charge rammed a <em>horned charge</em> at MMBMC and sent him crashing into the boxes. Thrust discharged a <em>flash wave</em> at Enoch, but it was backfired by <em>arcane mirror</em>. But as soon as Enoch receded his defense for an attack, Azelle stepped in and punished Enoch was with a vivacious <em>lightning dance</em>. Then Nero joined in and slashed the dark wanwan with <em>poison claws</em>, followed by White Veld’s summoning of a <em>gorilloz spirit</em> into him to land an earth-shattering blow on Enoch with double power. The final touch was delivered by Thrust’s <em>lightning</em> attack: he <em>concentrated</em> on his target, then <em>focused</em> all his energy into the electric sacks on his forehead, and at last fired his canon at the disoriented Enoch with an ungodly ZAP!!! (All the while the korgons were throwing acorns <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif">)<br>The gang rejoiced for the solidarity against their common foe, but it was too early to celebrate — Thrust’s <em>lightning</em> was not the KO move. As soon as Enoch regained his footing, he used <em>recover</em> on himself and was now standing in full health against the gang.<br>The gang surrounded him; Enoch looked at all corners, felt their every movement, breath and pulse with his 6th sense ability, took a defensive stance for battle, narrowed his eyes, and said...<br><strong>ENOCH</strong>: “Screw this!”<br>...and trotted out of the room.<br><strong>EVERYBODY</strong>: O_o<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Uhh...

                <strong>MMBMC</strong> (getting up): “That’s it!!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"><br>MMBMC raised his hand to snap his fingers, but Thrust jumped and bit his raised hand just in time. Then MMBMC raised his left fist to strike Thrust, but Azelle jumped up and bit that hand, while Throttle persistently tugged on his leg. Next, White Veld stepped in from behind and wrapped his arms around MMBMC’s to prevent him from using them, and Nero (since he had no arms) snatched onto the other leg. All the while Toothpick talked to himself:<br><strong>TOOTHPICK</strong>: “’And it looks like BMC is in position to get another taste of vengeance from the dinoz! Isn’t that so, Toothpick 2?’ ‘Right you are, Toothpick 1. It seems that there is absolutely no way that MMBMC can get out of this heap of poop he is in right now. In this unfair 5 to 1 matchup, we can expect Mad Mod to declare “gg” any second.’”<br>Meanwhile, the korgons had a predicament of their own:<br><strong>AMIGOS</strong>: “Amigo, we’re out of acorns!”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Then we go for plan Bob!”<br><strong>BOB</strong>: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>By this time, MMBMC freed himself from White Veld’s grip and Thrust and Azelle off of his hands. With his hands free, he attempted to snap his fingers again, but the two korgons threw Bob square into his face like a dodge ball and disoriented him long enough for Charge to muster up his <em>wrath</em> and <em>charge</em> at him with another <em>horned charge</em>. The impact sent MMBMC flying into the wall.<br><strong>LOLWHUT</strong>: “Fighting him will help, but it’s not the solution.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Then what is your solution?”<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “I know! Lolwhut can handle him! She has her mod powers back!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><strong>LOLWHUT</strong>: “I do, but I’m a player mod, not one of those omnipotent MT mods. I can’t remove Mad’s Mod’s powers from him.”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Then what do we do?”<br>MMBMC quickly regained consciousness and thrust his arm outward. Immediately after that, everybody in the room mysteriously lifted into the air and flew into the opposite wall!<br><strong>MMBMC</strong>: “Hehe. Enoch is not the only one with the Arcane element. Lord Honorus granted only the two of us with this power! Now witness my <em>telepathic attack</em>!”

                Thrust dodged on time, but the others were less fortunate. As the yellow wanwan hid behind some untouched barrels, he could not just watch his friends suffer the curse of MMBMC’s arcane attacks. Fortunately, there were barrels all over the place, so while MMBMC blacked the others out and started looking for Thrust, Thrust managed to conceal himself from the Mad Mod’s sight. But now MMBMC was aware of the annoying obstacle and used his <em>telepathic attack</em> to hoist them into the air and exposing Thrust into the open. The only barrels he did not lift were the ones filled with black powder — and they were positioned right next to wall.<br>With a quick <em>lightning attack</em> and Thrust’s decisive reaction, the barrels exploded and water from the ocean started gushing in! But then, it all stopped in midair.<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Aww, c’mon! How’s that even possible?” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br><strong>MMBMC</strong>: “Hehe. <em>Time control</em>. It’s effective on almost anything. And, as I was saying, I am erasing your accounts once and for bad!”<br><em>Fingers snap!</em><br><em>Nothing happens</em><br><strong>MMBMC</strong>: “What?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: &gt;.&lt; ... &gt;.O ... O_O<br><strong>MMBMC</strong>: “Why isn’t it working?!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"><br><strong>LOLWHUT</strong>: “Remember, you’re a player mod. You don’t have the power to ban people’s accounts like the MT mods.”<br><strong>MMBMC</strong>: “Grrrrrr!

                <u>You asked for it! Get ready for episode 5 of the Under-Domeeries! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"></u><br><br><strong>DWARF SPY</strong> (talking through the radio): “Come in, Black-Wan! Come in, Black-Wan!”<br><strong>ENOCH</strong> (talking from the other end): “For the last time, I’m not Black-Wan!”<br><strong>DWARF SPY</strong>: “Why so serious?”<br><strong>ENOCH</strong>: “And that line is taken!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/chart.gif"><br><strong>DWARF SPY</strong>: ...<br><strong>ENOCH</strong>: “So, any news about the Underwater Dome and the HACA?”<br><strong>DWARF SPY</strong>: “Yea, the HACA has been fighting off a lot of eeloz and old scorpscubas recently. They keep attacking the Underwater Dome by waves and waves almost every day. Now all the HACA’s dinoz are worn out. I think this is the perfect time to launch an attack of the Conquerors.”<br><strong>ENOCH</strong>: “Good. But to make sure, scrutinize the place some more and report back to us one more time. We don’t want to risk a surprise counterattack.”<br><strong>DWARF SPY</strong>: “Got it!”<br>The dwarf said that a little too loudly. White Veld and a winks were passing by and overheard the hidden espionage.<br><strong>WHITE VELD</strong>: “Hey! You’re not one of us!”<br>With that, the dwarf decisively withdrew a pepper grenade from his utility belt and threw it at the two. The explosion sent both of them flying and badly injured White Veld. But thanks to the winks’ hard <em>shell</em>, the blow did not do major damage to him, and that allowed him to counter with an <em>electrolysis</em> attack and knock the spy out.<br><br><u>BTW, if you guys want to see how Zendude looks like, just look at my account.

                <u>Yea, pretty much all my major characters are now playable dinoz. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"></u><br><br><br><strong><u>Episode 5: Need &amp; Greed</u></strong><br>The Underwater Dome was roaring with the cry of battle: it was under attack by a huge school of eeloz and old scorpscubas, probably the 25th wave so far. Water dinoz of the HACA resisted the attack with pressurized <em>water canons</em> and other elemental attacks, supported by napalm filled charges that the Underwater Dome threw. That combination took care of a part of the school, but now the water dinoz had to retreat to rest up, and the invaders were slashing their claws and banging their weight onto the wall of the Dome.<br><strong>SOLDIER</strong>: “T200, our water dinoz are worn out, and the enemy now has physical contact with the Dome!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Are there any borgs among them?”<br><strong>SOLDIERS</strong>: “None have been reported.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Then the enemy doesn’t worry me, as long as they’re not borgs. Gather the electric dinoz to the walls!”<br>He could consider it done! The lightning dinoz were quickly organized to their positions and at the lieutenant’s command, they electrocuted the attacking monsters. That got rid of the aged scorpscubas — the ol’ timers didn’t have it go swimmingly for them <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"> — but not the eeloz, they’re shockproof skin only absorbed the power. And as if that was not enough, a borg appeared at the scene.<br><strong>SOLDIER</strong>: “T200, borg spotted!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “I was hoping that would not happen...”<br><strong>SOLDIER 2</strong>: “Sir, the norg has spotted the main entrance to our Dome! There’s no telling when the gate is gonna give in to that monster’s huge fists! Worse still, the eeloz are following suit!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Grrrrr... I can’t stand borgs!... Wait, there’s a dehydration vault between the entrance and the Dome. That gives me an idea. Let ‘em in!”<br>The order was obeyed. The borg and its eeloz wingmen entered into the dehydration vault, and the gate closed behind them. Then the electric dinoz surrounded the vault and electrocuted it with a <em>lightning</em> attack. And this time, it was strong enough to knock the eeloz out. But the borg remained unharmed, thanks to its <em>resistance</em>.<br>No sweat, though. The defenders took care of it by draining the water out of the chamber, leaving the borg vulnerable to dehydration.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Ever seen a borg out of water? I read that they can’t use <em>resistance</em> if their skin is dry, so why don’t we help them out? Get the fire dinoz in their!”<br>The softpigs and moueffes hurried inside and quickly finished the job. All that was left of the borg was a nice, juicy stake that could last the whole organization for at least a week!<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Good job, boys. Another siege resisted. However...”<br>White Veld and the winks, along with Fangstriker, carrying an unconscious dwarf, interrupted him.<br><strong>FANGSTRIKER</strong>: “T, we found this spy hiding in the Dome.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Take him in for questioning. And you, men! Prepare for another invasion. We don’t know how long these monsters will persist.”

(retard-philia?)</u> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink2.gif"><br><br><br>They arrived at a dark room where the dwarf was seated. All around him were T200, Fangstriker, White Veld, the winks and Amigo, and a giant machine...<br><strong>T200</strong> (threateningly): “Alright, spy, you better listen well! This machine is a polygraph, also known as a lie detector, so there is no deceiving us. If you attempt any kind of trickery, your deception will be punished, and I don’t mean kindly.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Si. This machine can detect your blood pressure, pulse, respiration, breathing rhythm, and skin conductivity. If you tell the truth, the green light will shine; if you lie, the red light will tell us the truth.”<br><strong>AMIGOS</strong>: “But should you not first attach wires to him or something, Amigo?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “O, hola, Amigos. No, no need for that. Introducing the new, deluxe model, state-of-the-art, wireless polygraph (designed and created by Philips. <em>*ding-ding*</em> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif">).”<br><strong>AMIGOS</strong>: “Shouldn’t that be wireless internet?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “No, because we already live in an internet.”<br><em>Okay, back to the topic already! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/chart.gif"></em><br><strong>T200</strong>: “Who are you, where are you from, why are you here, and who sent you?”<br><strong>DWARF</strong>: “I’ll never tell you!”<br><em>*green light flashes*</em><br><strong>FANGSTRIKER</strong>: -_- “This plan is an even more epic fail than the time I gave you that rip-off dinopedia, T200.”<br>However, nobody in the room, except Throttle, noticed a name tag hanging latently on the spy’s jacket. Throttle, quickly detached the tag and gave it to T, and then meowed for affection — an award for his finding.<br><strong>T200</strong> (superficially patting Throttle): “So, your name is Need, and you work for the Conquerors as a mercenary. True?”<br><strong>NEED</strong> (grunting): “True...”<br><em>*green light flashes*</em><br><strong>T200</strong>: “There, you see, Fang? He’ll cooperate with us. Isn’t that right, polygraph?”<br><em>*green light flashes*</em><br><strong>NEED</strong>: “My capture will not matter, though; and it won’t matter whether I tell you anything or not, but the Conquerors know where you are located.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Then why haven’t they sent us any attacks?”<br><strong>NEED</strong>: “We were waiting for the perfect time. But I guess the perfect time is now: you’ve worn yourselves out in fighting the underwater monster, so now you are hopeless against our fresh army.”<br><em>*green light flashes*</em><br><strong>T200</strong>: “You mean they’ll be here any hour?”<br><strong>NEED</strong>: “Yes.”<br><em>*green light flashes*</em><br><strong>T200</strong>: <strong>“WHY DO ALL THE BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO THE GOOD GUYS!!!”</strong> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/nooo.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/nooo.gif"><em>*green light flashes*</em>

                At the hospital wing (and not the kind that you find in Harry Potter)...<br><strong>FRICAYA</strong> (putting a cast on White Veld’s arm): “Hold still! Just one more cast!”<br><strong>WHITE VELD</strong>: “No offense, but — OW!!! — I’d rather have someone with hands put casts on me... OW!!!”<br><strong>FRICAYA</strong>: “What?! For the love of Pete, I’m trying to help you!!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"><br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Hey, relax.

He may be a little... socially stupid, but remember: he absorbed most of the force of the blast for that winks, what’s-his-name.”<br>Thrust was silent during the whole conversation, seemingly aggravated about something. Azelle decided to investigate.<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Hey.”<br>No answer.<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “What’s going on?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “I can’t believe T200 didn’t question that dwarf anything about the Treacherous Totem!”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Relax. It’s natural that everybody forgets about something they haven’t heard of for many months.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Then that makes me the only one.”<br>Azelle couldn’t think of anything to say from here: Thrust was too cross to talk. However, an idea flashed above her head.<br>Leaving the hospital wing, she went looking for Amigo, who wasn’t so difficult to find (thanks to his loud mouth).<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Amigo! There you are!”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “O, hola, Azelle.<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: ... “Erm, what are you doing?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Trying to hook some chicks.”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: O_o<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “What?

                <u>So, sorry for not posting yesterday. I don't know if any of you experienced this, but I couldn't log in from yesterday morning until this noon due to a certain connection error. The same thing happened to my friend simultaneously. I also noticed that the Spanish server had the same technical difficulty, so I deduced that everybody was having this problem. But apparently, only a few players were suffering this issue, so I have almost no idea of what happened. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink2.gif"><br>Anyway, here's the chunk:</u><br><br><br>Amigo silently slipped into the prison cell that Need was thrown into. Luckily, the dwarf was asleep (or else he might have taken the korgon as supper), so Amigo was free to search into his pockets, and etc. There was nothing significant enough to salvage, except for an esoteric-looking talisman around the dwarf’s neck. That he abstracted and took off as quickly, but silently as he could, back to Azelle.<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Here you go, Azelle.”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Thank you.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Ei, don’t thank me, senorita. How about you and me go out for dinner, no?” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: O_o “I’m Thrust’s inamorata*.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “O RLY?” =D<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “What? NO!! I meant-”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Olei! I’m telling this to the guys!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Geez, you’re annoying.”<br><strong>ZAP!!!</strong> <em>*Azelle shocks him with an <strong>electric attack</strong>*</em><br><strong>AMIGO</strong> (dazedly from the shock): “I’m the 101st way to cook a korgon...” @.@<br>Azelle took the talisman and went to consult Thrust.<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Hey, Thrust! Look what I’ve got.”<br>At first, Thrust showed little attention, but then he recognized the familiar shape of the talisman that closely resembled the shape of the Totem.<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Hey, this looks strikingly similar to the Treacherous Totem.”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Do you think...”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Yes, there definitely is a relation. I’ll take it to T200 and maybe he’ll finally start thinking about it.”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Well, if I won’t be of any disturbance to you, I’ll come along.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br><strong>FRICAYA</strong>: “Seconded from my part.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “White Veld, comin’?”<br><strong>WHITE VELD</strong>: “Er... I think I’ll take a pass, you know. I’m too weak to go on, hehe...”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Huh, fine.” <br><br><br><u>Inamorata* - a lover; a woman who is a man's lover</u>

                Unfortunately, they had to wait until the next day. Night had already fallen, and T200 was sleeping in his room. All Thrust could do was scratch at the door and meow in his futile attempts to wake his master.<br>The next morning, the three of them went to T200’s room again, but this time he was not there. He was already wide awake escorting the prisoner, along with a few other HACA members, to the polygraph to squeeze out more answers.<br>Suddenly, the Dome started to shake violently! From the Dome’s transparent canopy, every human and dino saw the scorpscubas attacking again, and without even waiting for T200’s orders, they jumped into action to resist the monsters!<br>But now, with T aiming his focus on the assailants, Need’s bondage was loosened, and he seized the initiative to reach into his pouch for a pepper grenade and throw it to the ground with a deafening explosion that sent his captors flying in opposite direction; thus, he stole away in the covert of smoke.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Let him go! There’s no way he can escape the Dome anyhow!”<br>But he was wrong! One of the hostile scorpscubas, managed to break into a side dome and allowed the Atlanteid water to gush in. But thanks to the HACA’s decisive reflexes, they sealed off a few doors and prevented the water from overflowing the whole Dome. Nonetheless, that was not the main issue: that scorpscuba was especially sent not only as an assailant, but to salvage Need out of captivity, which it did. With it mission accomplished, it gave out a long, melodious whale’s screech to which the other scorpscubas took as a signal of retreat.<br>The Underwater Dome imminently was silent; the HACA members looked on with baffled glances at the retreating monsters and at each other. The only scorpscuba that remained was the one that saved the dwarf spy; it was not moving from its position. Then, its mouth started to open, and a horde of water dinoz spewed out and into the Underwater Dome. Their eyes were glowing red with a strange and sort of incorrigible* hatred. One look at that and T200 recognized them in a flash — demons...<br><br><br><u>Incorrigible* - so bad that it cannot be corrected or reformed</u>

                Thrust, Azelle, and Fricaya realized that now was not the ideal time to consult T200 — the Conquerors were making their first assault on the Underwater Dome, and valor of the demonic army was more formidable than any of the attacks by the neutral monsters!<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Ohhhhhhh, we’re getting so much poop for this!” O_O<br>The first troops attacked — the resistance dinoz fought back with electric attacks: first at long range before engaging toe-to-toe. Wood dinoz stood behind them as backup units, and behind them were fire dinoz, all fired up to defend the only base the HACA possessed... but none of them withstood the onslaught of the demons.<br>Thrust, Azelle, and Fricaya were all caught into this fierce battle, and one of the demons turned its head on them, but Thrust shielded everyone inside his <em>hermetic aura</em> just in time to deflect the demon’s <em>fatal hit</em>. And in return, Fricaya blasted him away with a <em>water canon</em> while Azelle electrocuted the stream and fried the demon.<br>That was only one attack, but they had to face a stampede of demons and defenders, making their way out of the battle zone under the covert of Thrust’s <em>hermetic aura</em>.<br><strong>T200</strong> (whistling the scorpscuba caller before shouting): “Restreat! Get your dinoz and your butts outta here!”<br>No one could agree less. In only an instant, the Underwater Dome was fraught with terrified humans and dinoz alike; it was every man for himself! And this time, neither T nor any other high-ranking official could bring the pandemonium to order.<br>Los Tres Korgons nearly got trampled upon by the retreating defenders, but Thrust and the girls snatched them out of harm’s way (Thrust saved Bob, Fricaya saved Amigos, and Azelle saved Amigo).<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/keepcool.gif"><br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “I could drop you if I wanted to!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twisted.gif"><br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Siento.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/rolleyes.gif"><br>A few more dinoz masters were picked off before the whole organization could reach the friendly scorscubas, but by that time, the Underwater Dome had once again fallen into the hands of the Conquerors.<br>Thrust looked back at the dome from inside the scorpscuba, standing beside his master, all the while the trinket hung in his mouth...

                Grumhel Forest: that’s where they were now. The young scorpscubas had taken them up the Jumin River into safe haven somewhere in the treacherous forest; however even there they had to be extra careful about cannibal korgons, tawny bats, and especially the infamous Arboreal Guardians.<br>Nevertheless, if there was any time to tell T200 about the trinket, it was now. But once again, Thrust’s chance was impeded: the shadow f a dwarfish figure stepped out of the fog that ruled the forest. Immediately, all the dinoz took the dwarf as Need and surrounded him with hateful snarls, hisses, and grunts, and left no room for him to escape! The dwarf seemed perplezed and equally as angered as the dinoz. He even summoned a couple of rescue flamelets from the flasks that he carried, but they were quickly taken care of with a <em>cold shower</em>. After that, he was totally in their control.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Bring him in! This time we’ll double our awareness! Isn’t that right, Need?”<br><strong>DWARF</strong>: “I’m not Need!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Pfft! Like I’m gonna fall for that one. You dwarves go lower than your height!”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “That’s not what the polygraph says.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Ehh... You brought that polygraph with you?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Si, the main part of it, anyway.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><strong>DWARF</strong>: “I’m tellin’ ya’ll! I’m not Need, ya dirt bags!” &gt;:[<br><strong>T200</strong>: “I swear, I’ve never seen such a liar in my life! Why, I ought to kill you on the spot!”<br>“Hold it!” said a voice out of the blue.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Who the hell is it?”<br>From the same direction where the dwarf came from, a human figure dashed out of the fogs and stopped T200 before he could deal any harm to the little man.<br><strong>SHO</strong>: “Detective Sho is the codename. And I am responsible for this man’s wellbeing.”<br>“And so am I!” said a female’s voice from beyond the mist. It was a woman with an expression marked by irreproachable seriousness and a sword dangling from her belt in its sheath. <br><strong>WOMAN</strong>: “A mercenary — that’s all you should know.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “It’s nice to make your acquaintance, but this man is a dangerous criminal and must be taken care of immediately.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Wait, senor. The polygraph says you’re lying.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “I’m ly-... What?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Now it says I’m lying!” O_o<br><strong>T200</strong>: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif">:<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Hmm... Testing, testing, what I am now saying is a lie.”<br><em>*Red light flashes*</em><br><strong>EVERYBODY</strong>: ...<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “It’s broken...” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cry.gif"><br><strong>T200</strong>: “So...” *turning the three strangers* “You’re telling the truth?”<br><strong>DWARF</strong>: “Well, of course, ya slime ball! Mercenary, I’ll pay ya 10 million gold coins to kill him with style!!”<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong>: “There he goes again...” -_-

I give up!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/dontcare.gif"><br>The polygraph did not matter so much anymore. What T200 was more concerned about was the three strangers and what they had to do with all that had happened. Well, apparently — no. The three each told their story, with the mercenary giving the shortest testimony with the tersest language T had ever heard. It was obvious she did not trust anyone, and that included her companions. The Dwarf’s name was Greed, the detective’s was under a codename, Sho, but the mercenary did not disclose hers; she only replied with an unalterable look.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “So, thank you for giving such charming tales of yourselves, but let’s now take a holistic approach: What are you three doing this deep in Grumhel terrain, and why? Detective...”<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong>: “It’s between us and a certain criminal we’re after, Mr. T200.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “You mean Batard, the most wanted man in all of Dinoland?”<br>The detective replied to that with by looking away for a moment, and then returning his stern glance.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Don’t worry, it’s no big surprise to me. I’ve heard plenty other bounty hunters who, just as much as you do, love gold and scalps. It’s the virally popular trend these days — catchin’ bad boys.”<br><strong>BOB</strong> (starts singing): “<em>Bad boys, bad boys! What’chya gonna do? What’chya gonna do when they come for you!</em>” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><strong>AMIGOS</strong>: “Er, si, siento for that. He can be so stupid and random at time, but please go easy on him — he’s just a Bob.”<br>Now, Thrust found the opportunity to give his master the trinket. So, while Azelle, Fricaya, and the others were calling off for the night, Thrust krept from behind T200 and climbed over his shoulder.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Thrust? What are you doing up so late?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Meow.” *giving him the trinket*<br>T200 stared at it for a bit, recognizing the familiar shape of the amulet to the shape of the Totem. He slowly displayed it to his guests and asked:<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Does this look familiar to you?”<br>To the mercenary and detective, it meant nothing, but Greed took a scrutinizing look at it, then clenched his hand into a fist.<br><strong>GREED</strong>: “Need...”

                The conversation was soon over, and the three guests dispersed, each having some private time away from the safety of the HACA group.<br>Greed, still hands clench, was muttering to himself words of vengeance...<br><strong>GREED</strong>: “If there was one thing I would want more than the money Batard will get me is Need’s head! I’ll get you, Need. I can promise you that. You’ll pay for what you did back at the mine...”<br><br>Meanwhile, the mercenary was reflecting upon her life — all the travails that she had gone through, and her dark past that had molded her into the person she was now.<br>She recalled her mother, whose dark magic was implemented in the mercenary from her beginning. <br>She recalled her child, who, at only a young age of 6, died in a fire when the mercenary turned her head; the memory was as agonizing as the thought of her mother.<br>She recalled her own life — the album of nothing but sunken memories. Death was her weapon — it wasn’t the sword — and the burden of the many lives that she had claimed was the fetters on her feet.<br>No one could be trusted, she thought to herself, not Need, not the detective, not T200 and his trusty wanwan, not the HACA — nobody. Such was she, inside and out.<br><br>But no one knew this as a fact: T200 and Detective Sho were secret partners, and their private time was a serious discussion:<br><strong>T200</strong>: “So, how’s the Dinoland Police academy and Garland?”<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong>: “As usual... And Garland, the man’s obsessed. But so far, he doesn’t know that I’m actually working for you.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “And I’d like you to keep it that way. Remember, we’re in control. We <strong>have</strong> to be in control. To get rid of the Conquerors, we must be omnipresent and active at all times.”<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong>: “Yes, sir.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “And what about these two?”<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong>: “I don’t think they have anything to do with the Conquerors. The woman’s a mercenary — she’ll work for the highest bidder. The dwarf — a pain in the butt — but too <strong>greedy</strong> to work for anybody else, Conquerors inclusive.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “He does know something about this trinket.”<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong>: “True, true. S’pose he could help?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Yes, that is if we can satisfy his unquenchable greed.”<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong> (laughing lightly): “Oh we can find a way to appease him.”<br>The talk didn’t ensue for long. Sho warned T to stay clear of the mercenary—there was something inside of her that he did not like, something like a demon. With that, he talk ended.<br>The detective left T200 and Thrust alone.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Don’t tell anyone what happened here, Thrust.”<br>And having said that, he put the trinket around Thrust’s neck.<br>The sun arose from the horizon...

I want to become a fiction writer in the future, so this is kind of like trainin to me. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"></u><br><br><br>The morning sun rose slowly, but the morning itself was not very welcoming...<br>A loud shattering noise started the day for the HACA, and it was not from a natural occurrence, but an angry stomp by an Arboreal Guardian! — one out of a whole stampede!<br>Now the whole camp was up and fighting them off: several cloudoz flew up to protect the defenders from <em>meteors</em> with their <em>bubble</em> skill, while the rest gave the guardians their best shot.<br>However, the battle had many surprise to offer, and it wasn’t the strength of the Guardians that was most unexpected, but it was the formidability of the mercenary that everybody had a sensational shock of. The detective’s versatility with his wanwan was also astonishing, and Greed — despite his petite size — was putting up a real challenge for the Arboreal, with the help of his rescue flamelets, of course.<br>By the time only a few minutes have passed, the mercenary had already felled two Guardians (which is a surprising feat for a human, let alone a dino), and the detective and dwarf each felled 1 Guardian and injured plenty others. Plus, with the added help of the HACA dinoz, they managed the drive the intruders out of the campsite.<br>That over, T200 walked over to the mercenary while the crowd cheered for its victory without losing a single member.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “A’right?”<br>The mercenary had taken some damage: she had been fighting in the hardest part of the battlefield. But her wounds were mysteriously being cured by an esoteric power that appeared to emanate out from beneath her skin — a black, fire-like substance. T200 now understood was Sho meant (the detective secretly aimed a caustic look at the woman).<br><strong>MERCENARY</strong>: “Yes, I’m okay.” *quickly hiding her wounds to conceal the darkness*<br><strong>T200</strong> (ignoring it): “You fight well, much better than most men. You think you could spare some time to help us reclaim the Underwater Dome?”<br><strong>MERCENARY</strong>: “It depends.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “On what?”<br><strong>MERCENARY</strong>: “On how much it’s worth it.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Well, we don’t have much on us. But we can offer you a sincere treaty between you and our organization.”<br><strong>MERCENARY</strong> (grunting): “I usually reject such proposals, but I’ve heard much about you, and I agree that outcasts should help each other. I’ll do it.”<br>The agreement was made. However, the detective was not too happy with T’s decision. He quickly pulled him away and whispered:<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong>: “What do you think you’re doing? Don’t trust that woman!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “At ease. I know exactly what I’m doing...”

                <u>Gee, thanks! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"></u><br><br><br>It was noon when the whole organization gathered for a meeting to hear T200 and the other HACA leaders inform them about the overthrow plan.<br>Thrust, Azelle and Fricaya, as well as White Veld, Nero, Charge and Zendude, were sitting next to each other, followed by Los Tres Korgons (who brought a box a popcorn with them <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/huh.gif"> ).<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Guys, what’s up with the popcorn?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “It’s gonna be a long lecture, so we need grub.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “How the heck did you cook the kernels?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “No me conoce. Amigos knows.”<br><strong>AMIGOS</strong>: “We used the fire from the Guardian’s <em>meteor</em> leftovers.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/rolleyes.gif"><br><strong>BOB</strong>: “Barbeque meteors!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><strong>FRICAYA</strong>: “No wonder we didn’t see you guys in the fighting.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “You’re so busted if T finds out.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Ah, no problemo. We’ll bust ourselves out of it!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/lol.gif"> *high-fives Amigos*<br>The meeting commenced with T200 giving the preliminary speech.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Alright, everybody! We all know the Conquerors are a formidable enemy, ‘cause we’ve all fought them at the Clan Wars. For one thing, they have demons — something that we do not and shall not have in our arsenal.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong> (whispering to Amigos): “Did he say ‘<strong>arse</strong>nal’?” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/lol.gif"><br><strong>T200</strong>: “And for another, they have Enoch, the only known dino to have the unknown Arcane power. To beat them, it’ll take exceptional strategic planning, a bit of luck, and, God be merciful, the Lord’s might. So now I’ll let Fangstriker take over from here and explain to you all our planned strategy.”<br><strong>FANGSTRIKER</strong>: “Okay, *unfolding a map of the Underwater Dome* part of the Grunhel forest has a secret entrance into the Dome, which we dug for emergency cases like this. However, the secret passage is narrow, and so we cannot send our whole army at once. On top of that, we believe that Underwater Dome is now heavily guarded.”<br><strong>HACA SOLDIER</strong>: “So what’s the plan? Should we attack the Dome from all sides and drown the Conquerors all at once?”<br>There was a round of agreeing voices throughout the whole camp.<br><strong>FANGSTRIKER</strong>: “Well, that would be the easiest solution, but then we wouldn’t have any base other than this stink hole. So here’s what we’re gonna do: we’re gonna send a few of our most skilled masters down through the secret passage as a distraction. We’ll make it look like we’ve got plenty more coming from it to have as many Conqueror forces focus on them. Then, we’ll send the rest of our troops, which we will divide in three groups, to the main entrance and the two side entrances.”<br><strong>2ND HACA SOLDIER</strong>: “But we have three side entrances! Why leave that one open?”<br><strong>FANGSTRIKER</strong>: “Good question. Actually, we’re playing a little gamble here. We hope that right after we deliver the first main strike, some of the Conquerors will flee for their lives and take that remaining exit. Why do this? It’s because or forces our not strong enough to face the whole army, so it’ll make sense to try to scare them off first. Is that understood?”<br><strong>EVERYBODY</strong>: “Yes!”<br><strong>FANGSTRIKER</strong>: “Good! So, first we need some volunteers to go through the secret tunnel.”<br><strong>3RD HACA SOLDIER</strong>: “I have three cloudoz, and they all know <em>bubble</em>!”<br><strong>4TH HACA SOLDIER</strong>: “I have a rocky that can do a pretty powerful <em>hermetic aura</em> and a wanwan that knows <em>leafy dawn</em>!”<br><strong>5TH HACA MEMBER</strong>: “And I have Nero the sirain, and he knows <em>absolute zero, aqueous clone, acid blood, poison claws, Ker-Shaar beam,</em>, and if I have had just a little more time, I could have taught him <em>sumo</em>!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “And I have Thrust!”<br><strong>FANGSTRIKER</strong>: “No, T. We need you and Thrust for a different purpose: to find the leader of the Conquerors and somehow talk him into retreating before we send the full blast.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “You mean <strong>scare</strong> him? I can’t think of anything better to do than that!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/keepcool.gif"><br><strong>DWARF</strong>: “YEA!!! What I like more than money is blood (especially my brother’s blood)!”<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong>: “Batard can wait; we’ve got Conquerors to conquer!”<br><strong>MERCENARY</strong> (whispering to herself): “This is for my family, but I fear this will be the hardest battle I’ll ever face...”<br>The HACA cheered aloud — their shouts could be heard from all corners of Grumhel Forest. Only Thrust did not rejoice, because he knew that the only tangible* head-leader that the Conquerors had was Enoch, and T did not know that. Only Thrust could converse with another dino, especially another wanwan, so only he could do that task of his master — alone. But T200 was already set on his goal, so there had be a way to stop him...<br><br><br><u>Tangible* - visible or can be touched<br><br>Sorry these chunks are getting <strong>really</strong> long. It kinda feels like I'm writing Thrust 3!<br><br>Oh, and the 5th HACA soldier is actually Bruno (or Runo; I forgot <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/lol.gif"> ).</u>

I was on an errand...</u><br><br><br>The soldiers were organized quickly into three different groups; they would be escorted by a scorpscuba each to the Dome. In addition to that, a handful of the most elite troops of the HACA were gathered to be sent down the secret passage.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Is everyone ready?”<br><strong>EVERYBODY</strong>: “Ready!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Then move out! Go! Go! Go!”<br>The troops dispersed to their positions.<br><strong>FANGSTRIKER</strong> (walking up to T200): “T! Take this. *Hands him a joystick.* Use that to signal the three platoons when to attack. Press the button the first time to signal the first platoon to attack. Press it a second time to signal the second platoon to attack, and etc.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Understood. Now go to your allocated position.”<br>Fangstriker obeyed and the two went their ways.<br>First, the Elite Platoon went down the secret passage while the other three waited inside the scorpscubas. A short, but tense while later, the team had reach the Underwater Dome, and started the attack without a pause! There was a small battle between them and the patrollers, in favor of the HACA; however, the attack did not stir the whole Dome — much to T200’s dismay. In fact, there was no sign of any upheaval! Something was terribly wrong!<br>A Conqueror Commander patiently strode up to the battle zone and heaved up his hand, causing patrolling dinoz to stop, bringing the whole battle to a halt. The Elite Platoon, and T200 from afar were completely baffled.<br><strong>CONQ. COMMANDER</strong> (sneering): “You fools. You’d have been better off surviving in the Magnetic Steps! You think you can take on all of us. Well, if you arrogantly think so, then see if you can take on Magna Giga!”<br>Nobody was familiar with Magna Giga, whoever or whatever is was, but once the beast revealed itself to the HACA, they knew it would be a name they’d never forget! The monster roared a deafening roar!<br>It was a hippoclamp—a <strong>HUMUNGOUS</strong> hippoclamp!”<br><strong>CONQ. COMMANDER</strong>: “Magna Giga was 1,000 hp and knows all the double-skills by Madam X. Think you can take it? Try your luck.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/keepcool.gif"><br><strong>ELITE PLATOON</strong>: <strong>O_O!!!</strong><br>The hippoclamp roared, slashed about, and prepared to fire its most power attack on the intruders!... but then it got swallowed up by a <em>black hole</em> set up by Zendude... (Be thankful it wasn’t <strong>your</strong> hippoclamp! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/surprised.gif">)<br><strong>ZENDUDE</strong>: “Yo!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"><br><strong>ELITE PLATOON</strong>: <strong>OoO!!!</strong><br><strong>CONQ. COMMANDER</strong>: <strong>&gt;:O!!!</strong> ... “Everybody! KILL THEM!!!”<br>Now the Dome was stirred! All the Conqueror patrollers concentrated their attention on the attackers, giving T200 and Thrust a wide-open gap to enter (T200 was riding a different scorpscuba than the other three platoons’). He quickly entered the Underwater Dome like a special force unit and quickly scouted the area. The coast was clear: he pressed the button once, signaling the first platoon to infiltrate.<br><strong>T200</strong> (to himself): “Okay, now to find the head leader and...”<br>He could not finish the sentence before he received a shock from Thrust’s <em>electrolysis</em> attack, and he fell unconscious.<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Sorry, master. I had to do it. You don’t know what you’re in for, and I can’t explain it to you. It’s between me and Enoch...”

                It wasn’t hard to find Enoch’s room (which was originally T200’s), but it was difficult to surprise-attack his master like that. Nevertheless, Thrust boldly strode into the room; and sure enough, Enoch was there, facing the ocean’s depth from the window.<br><strong>ENOCH</strong> (calmly): “Thrust... You’re a common nuisance, you know that?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Give it up! We’ve got a huge army behind us and they’re ready to strike. We also have foreign aids that are helping us right now.”<br><strong>ENOCH</strong>: “You think you can scare me that way? All I see coming our way is one cargo of mangy, ragtag grunts you call soldiers. Oh, and by knocking your master out like that, he can’t summon the other two.”<br>What?! How did he know?! How could Enoch read Thrust’s mind like that?! thought Thrust. <br><strong>ENOCH</strong>: “With my <em>cat’s eyes</em>, I can read into one’s memories and thoughts, so there’s no way you can get to me with a direct approach.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/keepcool.gif"><br>Well, Thrust had to hand it to him: Enoch was one tough nemesis.<br>The first scorpscuba hit the main entrance, and the army emanated out. The First Platoon included the mercenary, Greed, and Detective Sho, as well as Azelle, Los Tres Korgons, Throttle, Nero, White Veld, Charge, Zendude, and their masters (well, Zendude’s master was Hydargol, and Zenzen monks rarely go to battles). However, once they got there, Greed immediately took off on his own direction, and the First Platoon, not knowing what was going on, turned into a disheveled band of ragtag grunts, just as Enoch “portended*”.<br><strong>ENOCH</strong>: “You’re so screwed, dude.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Shut up, black-wan! You’re so black that people go unlucky when you cross their road.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/evil.gif"><br><strong>ENOCH</strong>: “I’ll take that as a compliment.”<br>Then, without warning, Enoch fired a <em>deceleration beam</em> at Thrust! Thrust was not able to react fast enough to dodge it... and now it seemed like he would never be fast enough again! All the movements of his limbs were slowed down to the point where it would take him three seconds just to take a step forward!<br>And then after that, Enoch pounced on him...

                The First Platoon finally attacked the Conqueror defenders from behind, but their attack was a complete unorganized disaster (and I’m afraid to explain it in detail). As for Greed, he was on the pursuit to find his brother, Need; and he found him alright... he found him.<br><strong>NEED</strong>: “Greed! I thought I got rid of you at the mines!”<br><strong>GREED</strong>: “You thought I were dead, but you was mistakin’! An’ I wants my revenge now!”<br><strong>NEED</strong>: “If so, come and get it.”<br>Greed leaped at his brother without even a slight warning, but Need was too fast: he lifted his axe and blocked a smashing blow from Greed’s weapon...<br><br>Thrust tried his <em>acceleration</em> skill to counter Enoch’s <em>deceleration beam</em>, but its setback was that even though his movements were back at normal speed, he was exhausting his energy just trying to keep it that way. He received a series of severe beatings from Enoch, and he could not counter with decent attacks. Eventually, he was worn down to a halt and could not continue fighting. But Enoch was up as if nothing had happened! With one swift strike, he landed the finish blow!<br>However, Thrust was still alive, even after the ungodly strike! It appeared the Enoch intentionally left Thrust alive, but why?<br><strong>ENOCH</strong>: “What’s the fun in a turkey shoot? I’d rather kill you off in a fair fight. Anyone can take you down at this point, but I’m not like everyone. I’ll spare you this time, Thrust; but not your friends.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/keepcool.gif"> And he strode out of the room, with a disdainful gleam in the corner of his eye.<br>Thrust, now in terrible desperation, attempted to heal his wounds with <em>leafy dawn</em>, but he could only cure himself halfway. The deceleration curse was still not him, but it was wearing down. So, in pain, but with a resolute determination, Thrust clawed his way to the battlefield...<br><br><u>Sorry if my writing is not as good as in the other chunks. I was up late writing this, and so was really tired. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"></u>

                The other two platoons waited patiently for their summoning, but it never came. It would be an eternity if they would have to wait like that...<br>Meanwhile, the battle was heavily against the HACA. After ambushing the Conquerors from behind, they had to face the Conquerors big guns: the demon squad! If Greed had been there, the HACA would’ve broken through the enemy group before the demons were sent, but the fact was he was not there! Now, all of a sudden, the battle turned into a big game of cat-and-mouse. The HACA was on the run, but they were stranded inside the Underwater Dome, being picked off one at a time. Throttle of course was hiding his cowardly butt ( <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/evil.gif"> ) and the korgons could not think of a better way to survive ( <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twisted.gif"> ). Nero, White Veld, and Charge fought their hardest, combining elemental attacks to take out several dinoz at once, but they could not keep that up for long (and “cool” Zendude could care less ( <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"> )). The mercenary, she had to hide away to take some time to cure her wounds. Sadly, the only miracle cure she knew was the black magic she had so secretively used. As she slowly closed up her lacerations, she recalled the last time she used this dark force: it was the time when the demon inside of her nearly took control due to her excessive use of the magic. By doing so, she unleashed the demon inside of her — the heritage of her witch mother — that transformed her into a creature of her nightmares. It was very fortunate that no one knew of this, she thought. However, her memories were not a private matter for Enoch...<br><strong>ENOCH</strong> (using <em>cat’s eyes</em>): “Well, well, want an interesting story behind that hunk of flesh...”<br>To that, Enoch walked silently towards the mercenary until it was close enough to be noticed. The woman jumped with her sword ready at the first sight of the black wanwan, but it only meowed. It seemed harmless, even adorable, but looks can be deceiving. And sure enough, when she loosened her guard for only a jiffy, Enoch evaporated into a mist and overcame the mercenary’s attempt to ward him off. A second later, and his <em>manipulation</em> skill to effect.<br><strong>ENOCH</strong> (from inside of her): “Now, time to awaken the demon!”<br><br>Azelle saw it all: she and Detective Sho. The female wanwan was shocked know the truth behind the mercenary, and that truth confirmed Sho’s fears.<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong>: “Azelle, go get Thrust or T200. They’ll know what to do.”<br>He knew her name: that was another surprise to her. How could a stranger know her name? But no matter: this stranger was thinking straight, and so she obeyed that order. Past the corridors and the battles that they each contained, Azelle <em>accelerated</em> until she stopped at a dead-quiet room. There, Thrust struggled to keep his pace as he limped towards the sound of fighting nearby.<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Azelle!”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Thrust! There you are!”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “You were looking for me?”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “I was told to.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Told? But... who told you?”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong> (ignoring that question): “You’re hurt!”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “I’ll be fine, Azelle.”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Thrust, try to be honest with me! This is a serious time! Enoch has taken over the mercenary’s mind, and we don’t want to know what will happen soon! You’re the only one with a <em>primal state</em> that is powerful enough to stop her!”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Well, I’d love to, but Enoch’s <em>deceleration beam</em> is in the way. He sure was thinking a few steps ahead of me this time.”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “I’ll try to cancel it out with my <em>saving puree</em> skill that I just learned.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Don’t! You haven’t perfected it yet! Get Skora to do that!”<br>But Azelle did not listen. She closed her eyes and concentrated lightning energy in the four electrical sacks on her forehead and transformed that into healing power. The whole process took time, but when it was ready, she aimed the sphere of energy to Thrust... it did the job!<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Thank you, Azelle. Now it’s-”<br>But he was interrupted when the room quaked apocalyptically. Then, the beast appeared — it entered the room with the dissonance of battle raging behind it. The thing was huge! and as dark as a clear night sky.<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Now it’s time to go <em>primal state</em>...”<br><em>*Primal state awakened*</em>

                <u>Hopefully, the next episode will be more light-hearted with chunks that are easier to read. Well, I guess it depends on which genre you guys prefer; after all, it's my job *cough* <em>hobby</em> to keep you readers entertained. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"></u><br><br><br>What was once a human mercenary was now a 10-ton panther, with fur as ebon as the flames that awakened the devil; and if the windows of the Underwater Dome had not been a 5-inch layer of wired glass, the panther’s roars would have shattered them!<br>The devil finished its roar and charged at Thrust, who charged back in response: both collided at the center of the room! Thrust then sent a <em>flash wave</em> at the panther, but it withstood the punishing attack, and threw its weight at the wanwan as a body slam in response: its sheer size gave no room for Thrust to avoid it, hence the impact sent the two crashing into the battle zone at the other room. Again, Thrust summoned <em>flash wave</em>, only this time in rapid fire. The chain lighting flashed out in all direction, zapping Conquerors and HACA alike; not even the demons could take such a beating! All the while, the panther withstood every discharge.<br><strong>CONQ. COMMANDER</strong>: “Aww, he-e-e-e-ell! I never wanted it to end this way!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/evil.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/dontcare.gif"><br>He didn’t want to stay to figure out what would happen, and neither did the rest of the Conqueror army, so they opted to retreat. Enoch, of course, inside the panther’s mind was furious with the commander’s rash decision and tried to stop him, but the inattention to the main theme got the whole devil bashed on the side by Thrust’s <em>focus</em> power.<br>Chaotic moments later, the Conquerors were in their life-submarines and were exiting the Dome, leaving Thrust and the Panther to duke it out alone in the midst of unconscious HACA members. With every attack Thrust used, the panther would return the favor, and vice versa. However, the fighting amounted to nothing. Both sides stubbornly held on for dear life and sweet victory, as Thrust tried every skill and combination he knew, while Enoch inside the panther was content with slashing its gargantuan claws at the yellow wanwan.<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Come on, Thrust! You can do it!”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Si, man! And if anything happens, we’re right behind you!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br><strong>AMIGOS</strong>: “Right seventy-five meters behind you, that is.”<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “C’mon! Show that thing who’s da wanwan!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"><br><strong>ZENDUDE</strong>: “Yo.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"><br>The cheering group was a warm notice to Thrust, but that would just not be the key to his combative problem. In fact, he was slowly wearing down, not knowing that Enoch was latently sucking out the energy to feed his devil host. Out of the group that rooted for Thrust, only three knew something had to be done:<br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: “Man, Thrust can’t fight that big, bad, pantheh forevah!”<br><strong>NERO</strong>: “Agreed. Personally, I’d love to help out, but... safety comes first.”<br><strong>WHITE VELD</strong>: “Aww, that’s not nice, Nero. I mean, there must be something... I think...” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br><strong>NERO</strong>: “And if there isn’t?”<br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: “What’dyou mean, armless? There’s always something for the good guys!”<br><strong>NERO</strong>: “By Fortuna’s hair, only if the gods like us. And don’t call a Roman Emperor armless!”<br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: “Man, if the gods really liked, they’d take us up high into heaven forevah more! But if so, we wouldn’t be able to help Thrust.”<br><strong>WHITE VELD</strong>: “So... they hate us for a good reason?” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink2.gif"><br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: “Sounds plausible enough to me. Up top!” <em>*high-fives White Veld*</em><br><strong>NERO</strong>: “Okay, okay. But what can we do?”<br><strong>WHITE VELD</strong>: “Dunno... Maybe fetch T200? Maybe...”<br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: “Hey, that’s actually not a bad idea!”<br><strong>NERO</strong>: “Agreed. T will know what to do in a synch once he sees this.”<br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: “Then let’s go fetch ‘im!”

                The three charged past the corridors and then split up to hasten the search; and even so, it was not easy to find him, given that there were unconscious bodies littered all over the place. They checked — even scrutinized — each body so that they wouldn’t risk missing T200.<br>Nero, after scanning a whole corridor and found nothing, bulleted through proceeding corridors until he reached one that was completely empty.<br><strong>NERO</strong>: “Hmph... There probably won’t be anything from here. Better turn back.”<br>But then, he heard a faint moan from around the corner. When he decided to investigate the sound, he found him — T200!<br><strong>NERO</strong>: “Charge, Triple-U! I found T200!”<br>T200 was just waking up from Thrust electrical shock. He had a burn on his shoulder on which Thrust sat before he electrocuted him, and Nero could tell that it still hurt from the way T gently tried to palliate it with the cool metal cover of the joystick.<br>The other two showed up after a short while and helped Nero to anchor T200 on his feet.<br><strong>T200</strong> (weakly): “Thanks, guys...”<br>But it was no time to indulge in compliments; they guided him towards the duel site while bolstering him on his feet. It was back past the unconscious litter of HACA human and dino bodies (rest assured: they were still alive, just blacked out). When they almost reached the site, Detective Sho noticed the four and went over to give further aid. However, they didn’t need to go any further — Thrust and the panther crashed into the corridor that they were in!<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong>: “Well, T. Any bright ideas?”<br>T200 carefully speculated the black devil: lightning seemed to have minimal effect on it, it was aggressive, and its size was second to none of all the creatures he had seen!... but he still knew what to do.<br><strong>T200</strong>: <em>*whistle*</em> “Thrust!”<br>Thrust shot a quick glanced at the recovered T who was telling him what to do using sign language. It was going to be just like the borg trick from a couple of days preceding, only using an opposite method.<br>T200[g/] (talking by using his hands): Lure the panther into the dehydration chamber and leave the rest to us!”<br>The first relief that came to Thrust was that T200 was alright. The second relief was that there really was a way to stop that living terror, and that thought brought Thrust back to thanking God for having his first relief come true. So, he lured the giant panther through the corridors of the Underwater Dome until he found the dehydration chamber and sped inside. The panther followed without hesitation, as planned.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Alright. Now, Sho, close the chamber.”<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong>: “Aye!”<br>The detective pulled the lever to seal the door; but before it could close completely, Need and Greed appeared in the scene, still fighting like brothers at war. Greed aimed a punch right at Need’s chin caught him off guard! At that, Need noticed that his trinket was hanging around the neck of the yellow wanwan from the other side of the glass wall.<br><strong>NEED</strong>: “No!! My trinket!”<br>And without thinking, he jumped into the chamber right before the door was sealed!<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Hey, what the-?!”<br><strong>GREED</strong>: “Never min’! Jus’ do yer thing!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Right. Sho, filled the chamber with ocean water.”<br>The chamber was filled. The panther, not understanding what was happening, all of a sudden started to panic, but Thrust maintained his cool.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Thrust, <em><strong>electrolysis!!</strong></em>”<br><strong>ZAP<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"></strong>

                The whole spherical chamber flashed in brilliant colors from Thrust’s <em>electrolysis</em>. When the light-show stopped, T200 ordered that the water be drained out of the chamber so that he could retrieve what was left in it (the water had turned into separate gasses of oxygen and hydrogen, so all that escaped was gas*). Thankfully (and unsurprisingly <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif">), Thrust was alive, but not well — he had exerted all his energy on that <em>electrolysis</em> attack that he had none left to stand on his four paws. The giant panther was slowly shrinking back to its original form — the mercenary — and Enoch was now a separate being; both were unconscious and battle-scarred. As for Need... well... no one was going to attend his funeral.<br>T200 gently picked his wanwan up in his arms, and smiled as Thrust slowly regained consciousness.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “You did very well, Thrust. You’ve earned a nice, long rest.”<br>The detective and Greed hauled the mercenary out of the chamber, while White Veld grabbed Enoch by the nape of the neck and carried him off, but not before the arcane wanwan suddenly woke up and escape from the gorilloz’s hold!<br><strong>T200</strong>: “He’s awake! Get him, boys!”<br>But Enoch promptly used <em>ghastly presence**</em> to confuse the group and <em>teleported</em> back into the Dark World under the cover of holographic illusions.<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong>: “Well, there goes the world’s only arcane-powered dino.”<br>The illusions faded away like shards of nonexistence.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “He’ll always be back with something new, which means we’ll always have a chance to nail ‘im.”<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong>: “I guess you guys never get to have a break then.”<br>Now the mercenary started to wake up.<br><strong>MERCENARY</strong> (giddily): “Uhh... What?... How?... Can’t... remember...”<br><strong>GREED</strong>: “Ah, she’ll be a’right.”<br><strong>DETECTIVE</strong>: “Ya sure?”<br><strong>GREED</strong>: “She’s a’ways a’right. Now where be yer pub ‘n this ‘ere joint? Could sure party-hardy with some strong liqr’ for the death of me brother!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Through the door to your right, past 5 corridors, turn left, and go downstairs. Alcoholic beverages are 75 coins per half-liter. Quaff to your heart’s content, but I’d rather take this moment for my dinoz.”<br>A long silence befell them...

                The next day...<br><strong>THRUST</strong> (waking up from a deep sleep): *yawn* “Hu!” *stretches limbs* “Ow! Ahh! I think I’ve just stretch a muscle strap in my right leg!”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Are you okay?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “No, I stretched my muscle, and maybe even snapped it!”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Calm down, you’re fine, Thrust.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “I’m... Huh?” *looks around* “How did I get here?”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “You were having a big fight with that mercenary, so T brought you here, to the hospital wing.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Oh, right. It’s all coming back. I guess that explains why I’m hurting.” *attempts to stretch again*<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Wait, don’t do that! You’ll ruin the cast.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Cast?”<br>Thrust looked about him and realized that he was covered in casts and bandages.<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “How many bones did I break?”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Does it matter?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: ... “So, what happened to the mercenary?”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “She was brought here, too, for medical treatment. But right after she fully woke up, she insisted on departing. The detective and that short guy left with her.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “And how about the retreating Conquerors?”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Fangstriker led the two un-summoned platoons and taught them a lesson they’ll never forget. Guess t’was fortunate T200 didn’t summon them.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink2.gif"><br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “I see...” *long sigh* “Wait, Enoch!”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “He’s gone. There’s nothing to worry about.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: *grunt* “He got away again. He always does...”<br>At that moment, T200 entered the hospital wing and kindly dismissed the nurse from the facility to talk privately with his dinoz.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Hey, Thrust. Hangin’ on there?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Meow.” [Just charmingly.]<br><strong>T200</strong>: “How ‘bout you, girl? Being a big sister to him?”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Meow!” [Sure am!] <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br>Although T200 did not understand what exactly they said, he knew well enough what they told him. Then, he attached a sort of medallion on Thrust’s collar and explained its meaning.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Thrust, from this day on, you are a member of the E5 Crew. I guess you need further introduction on that point. The E5 is an elite group of five dinoz, which I and the committee have just created, in response to the Conqueror’s demon squad. Each dino of this group has to be the most skilled master in a different element so that they have every advantage making up for each other’s disadvantage. So, having declared the group’s creation, it was up to the committee to now vote for the five master dinoz, and, well, they chose you as the lightning master. Sounds good to you?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Meow-meow.” [I think I could work with that.]<br><strong>T200</strong> (smiling): “I’m sure you’ll find that position fitting for your status. You’ll find out who the other members are son enough. Now rest, Thrust. And you, Azelle, keep an eye on him.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Meow.” [No problemo.] <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif">

So who’s in for some demon butt-kicking action?”<br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: “I’m in!”<br><strong>WHITE VELD</strong>: “Me too.”<br><strong>NERO</strong>: “How can I resist the glory?”<br><strong>ZENDUDE</strong>: “Yo.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"><br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Then it’s up top, demons down!

                <strong>EXTRA:<br>A Korgon Special...</strong><br><br>Interview with Amigo.<br><strong>INTERVIEWER</strong>: “Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the [insert title here] show. I’m your host [insert name here], and today’s guest is Amigo the korgon.”<br><strong>AMIGOS</strong>: “Hola!”<br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “Now, Amigo, you’re a well-known character in the Under-Dome Series, as well as other stories by T200.”<br><strong>AMIGOS</strong>: “Gracias, senor!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “You’re welcome. So I’d like to ask you a few questions. For instance:<br><br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “<em>Where are you from? Spain?</em>”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “What, me? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! You kidding me?”<br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “Then where are you from?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “From the Spanish server.”<br><br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “<em>What would you say is your most outstanding feature?</em>”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “My tattoo.”<br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “Your tattoo?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Si. Wanna see what it says?”<br><br><cite><em><strong>Made In China</strong></em><br></cite><br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “<em>If you could describe yourself in one sentence, what would it sound like?</em>”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “A DinoRPG version of Jonny Bravo.”<br><br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “<em>How did fates bring you and the HACA together?</em>”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Oh, that would be the day that I won a free trip to Dinoland; only, I went travelling at the wrong time.”<br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “What time was that?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “The clan wars.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/dontcare.gif"><br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “Wow, how did you manage to survive?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “To my good fortune, T200 did not look at me as man-chow.”<br><br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “<em>What is your take on the ‘100 Ways to Cook a Korgon’ cookbook, and what is the first thing that comes into your mind when that title is mentioned?</em>”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Uncle Steve...” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cry.gif"><br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “I’m sorry to hear that. Was he a good man?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “A good korgon — yes. He was the best uncle a korgon could ever have. Unfortunately he was the ... way to cook a korgon.”<br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “Which number was he in the cookbook?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “I can’t say?”<br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “Why?” <br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Because he is under the title of the number that most juvenile kids would take as a dirty joke.”<br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “Oh, you mean the sixty-”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Don’t say it!! It breaks my little heart...”<br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “Sorry, sorry.”<br><br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “Last question. <em>How well do you relate with your two korgon pals?</em>”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Oh, Bob — I have nothing to talk about him. But Amigos — he’s like a thorn in my butt. I swear he’s like a total nightmare!”<br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “Why’s that?”<br><strong>AMIGOS</strong>: “Well, mostly because his snoring doesn’t let me sleep; that’s why he’s a mare in the night. It’s like I go to bed, all bushed for the day, I jump in my bed, close my eyes, and all of a sudden I hear ‘ZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzz!!!’”<br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “I see. So he’s like your insomnia incarnate?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Si, and it’s worse in the morning: it sounds like ‘COCK-A-DOODLE-DOOOO!!!’ — living proof that the inventor of alarm clocks didn’t know what the hell he was doing! If only Amigos had a snooze button on his nose, at least! So the next time I punch him in the nose, he’ll leave me alone in more than one way.”<br><br><strong>INT.-ER</strong>: “And that was Amigo, ladies and gentlemen! Good night!”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Adiós a todos!”<br><br><br><strong>THE END</strong>

                Hey, guys. So, a little update for ya'll... well, actually a big update. <strong>I am quiting Dino RPG!</strong><br>...<br>...<br>...<br>Okay, not really. I'm relocating to a different country, so it will be a while before I can start playing and writing again (at least a month of absence). However, I will be back with so many more added features to the Under-Dome Series.<br>During my absence, I will be brainstorming ideas for future UDS episodes, so you guys can keep bumping this thread if you want; if not, I can always create another one When I come back. The next episode will actually be episode 5.5: it's basically of diary of my life in my new home with the added twist of Thrust and Los Tres Korgons during the time that I'm absent.<br> I will also implement UDS in Paradino when I come back. the Paradino version will be slightly different than the written one in plot, background, and all that, but it will be no less entertaining.<br><br>If you have any questions, just PM me before the 11th of December (that's when I'm leaving). If you PM me later than that, you will have to wait at least a month to get a reply.<br><br>Thank you for being fans, and good luck to you all! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif">

                Hey, guys! I'm ba...<br><br>...not really. After about two weeks of being absent, I finally logged into Dino RPG; I borrowed my cousin's computer to do that and I still am. However, I'm really busy at the moment with stuff, so you can still consider me as 'away' about the UDS.<br><br>Keep voting on the Favorite Characater topic, guys! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"> It's a close battle between many of the characters, so you have to determine which one rules the roost!

                Guys, there's a possibility that you might have to wait longer than a month. It all depends on when I get my own PC. However, with the coming of New Year just before us, I felt I had to do something meaningful for you all. To do that, I have written a script for a little something that I will post on January 1st, 2011. So stay tuned. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                Alright, guys. I'm going to be "away" again, because I'm moving to a different location. I won't be writing stories until I buy my new computer. Hopefully I'll buy it within a week or two. A lot of stuff is happening over here, and it'll take time for me to adjust. But no matter what the situation (unless I die, which would be kinda lame), I will be back -- I can promise you that. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br><br>So... hasta lavista, baby. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif">

                <strong>WARNING:</strong> I might not be able to post as regularly as I did before, so please don't complain if I happen to skip a day or two from time to time. <br>Yours truly,<br>T200 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>Episode 6 opening:<br><br>It was a cold February weekend in the virtual world we know as Dinoland. And, since it was a weekend, White was having a break from work to visit a few friends back in the mainland. Here's how it went:<br><em>*Scorpscuba crashes through the ice surface and opens its mouth*<br>*White Veld walks out*</em><br><strong>WHITE VELD</strong>: "Thank you, George." <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><strong>SCORPSCUBA</strong>: "Take care." <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"> <em>*dives back down*</em><br>   White Veld walked passed the Frish Port and headed for the Fountain of Youth to go to his next destination. He enjoyed walking in the soft, crisp snow, and decided to play a bit and make an angel on the ground. But just then, two figures grew from the whiteness. First, they appeared as two snowmen, then they grew eyes, two horns, and sharp teeth. And now they looked more like abomidable snowmen.<br><strong>WHITE VELD</strong>: "Um... hi??" <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/huh.gif"><br>But the creatures' reply was a shrill, high-pitched, ear-piercing screech! White Veld quickly covered his ears and fell to the ground, but even that was not enough to prevent the noise from ecoing off the walls inside his ears! &gt;.&lt;<br>After a short time, screeching stopped. The creatures took a deep breath, and then the screeching ensued. @.@<br>White Veld couldn't take it anymore, 'cuase if he didn't do anything, he would be deaf and <strong>dead for life!</strong> So he got up, found his inner Schwartzenegger, and used his <em>giant</em> skill to crush those snowmen! He punched one, and then the other, and with that they vaporized into thin air.<br><strong>WHITE VELD</strong>: "What were they? I better report this back to base."

                Back at the Underwater Dome, a group of friends were having a coffee break.<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: "So I was on my way to the Coral Mines the other day, to investigate a case, and then right when I entered the Sticky Swamp, I realized that it was Thursday."<br><strong>OTHERS</strong>: "Oooooohhh!" &gt;.&lt;<br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: "Unlucky dawg, man!"<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: "I know.

It's late."<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: "Aww, but I don't want to! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"> Can't I stay up with Thrust for the midnight patrol?"<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: "Only if you promise to go to bed."<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: "Yay!...... Wait, I'm not falling for that!"<br>But before he could esacpe, Azelle snatched him by the nape and carried him off (with him struggling and shoutng for Thrust to rescue him).<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: "Hmph, why can't she take care of Throttle?"<br><strong>AMIGOS</strong>: "She just did, man."<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: "No, I mean all the time.

                Thanks, man. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br><br>The next day, Thrust told Amigo to Tell T200 about the abomidable snowmen, so the gang left the Underwater Dome to investigate. They hopped into a scorpscuba, and off they went for the Frish Port...<br><br><em>10 hours of undersea travelling later...</em><br><br>They arrived at their destination. The scorpscuba crashed through the ice and opened its mouth to let the passengers out.<br><strong>SCORPSCUBA</strong>: "Thank you for using Happy Scorpscuba Services!"<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: "Next time serve us food that doesn't taste like something from your belly!" <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/evil.gif"><br><strong>T200</strong>: "Quit ranting, Amigo, and tell us where White Veld found those snow guys."<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: "Oh, siento, senor. He says he saw them at the Fountain of Youth."<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Is that right, Triple-U?"<br>White Veld grunted for a reply, meaning 'yes'.<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Well then, let's go, boys!"<br><br><em>At the Fountain of Youth</em><br><strong>T200</strong>: "Well... I don't see any sign of a fight here..."<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: "It was snowing heavily last night. The tracks were covered."<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Makes sense... Thrust, Azelle, sniff for any clue you can find. Skora, <em>analyze</em> for any recent disturbance in the electromagnetic field."<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: "You too, A.C.E. <strong><em>Analyze!</em></strong>"<br>The foursome started scanning the area while the others searched for visible clues (like broken twigs, or the like). Throttle also joined in the sniffing search, and soon, he started cheerily digging into the ground like a wild mole.<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: "Look! Throttle found something!"<br>So everybody stopped their worked and gathered around Throttle. But when T200 picked him up, all there was was a mouse's tail sticking out of his mouth.<br><strong>EVERYBODY</strong>: "Awwwwww...!" <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twisted.gif"><br><strong>T200</strong>: "Spit that mouse out, boy!"<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: <em>*energetically shakes head*</em><br><strong>T200</strong>: "Bad wanwan! Bad!" <em>*slaps Throttle on the head*</em><br>Throttle responded to that, and spat the mouse out with a disgusted look. -&gt; <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/dontcare.gif"><br><strong>BENROY</strong>: "Hey, T! It looks like A.C.E. feels something coming towrds us."<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Hopefully it'll be those snowmen. Don't worry, we'll outnumber them."<br>Spoke too soon -- it was more than 10 of those snowmen, all surrounding them in a circle!... and none of them looked happy...!<br><strong>EVERYBODY</strong>: "O.O<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: "Man, you so typical."<br>The snowmen roared, and the team fainted...

                Gee, thanks, Mona10. May I ask you why your favorite character is Amigo?

It was therefore foreseen that T200 would lose the debate... (<strong>T200</strong>: <em>*grumbling*</em> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/dontcare.gif"> )<br><strong>ULTRA PIGLOUGLOU</strong>: "Then it is settled! We shall play a game!"<br><strong>T200</strong> (dully): "What kind of game...?"<br><strong>ULTRA PIGLOUGLOU</strong>: "The Inter-Dojo Tournament!"<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: "I heard of it. It's a tournament that takes place once a month on the month between master-raised dinoz throughout the world."<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Okay, but what do piglouglous have to do with a human-managed game?"<br><strong>ULTRA PIGLOUGLOU</strong>: "If you defeat our champion, we will leave your friends alone and also leave Dinoland for spring to come!"<br>The HACA gave a positive mumble to that.<br><strong>ULTRA PIGLOUGLOU</strong>: "But if you don't, winter will stay here for six more weeks."<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: "Sounds like Groundhog Day to me."<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Except we're gonna make that groundhog overlook its shadow!"<br>With that, the gang accepted the challenge and headed out.

                Because he's hilarious? And adorable? And hilarious? Haha, I love all the other characters too, don't get me wrong, but Amigo is just the most charming and entertaining.

                Don't sweat it. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"> I always like to hear other people's opinions on things.<br><br><br><strong>T200</strong>: "How do we enter the tournament, Benroy?"<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: "Let's see... <em>*pulls out a guide book*</em> According to this, we have to build and officiate a dojo before we can enter."<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Okay, but how do we build a dojo?"<br><strong>BEROY</strong>: "A better question is where do we get the materials?"<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: "I can help you, children."<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Whoa, nice entry, mister. Quite conveniently in time too."<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: "Is she a man or is he a woman?"<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: *-_-<br><strong>BENORY</strong>: "Sorry, but are you Master Zenith?"<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: "Yes. I run the International Dojo League. I couldn't help overhearing your talk of entering the Tournament."<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Why, yes. Benroy and I were just discussing that point."<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: "Aaaaahhh... Follow me. We shall talk about it more."<br>So they followed the old man... or whatever, into his hut. It was a Mongolian style yurt made of thick castivorous skin, with a fireplace set up right in the center of the area. When they entered, they were amazed at how warm it was inside! It was warmer than a starndard heated house. They could stay there all winter if they wanted to, but, of course, adventurers don't get breaks...<br>They talked over the matter of entering the tournament after having a cup of strong green tea. After an unrecorded timeof discussion, Master Zenith finally said in a calm but steadfast voice:<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: "You know, building a dojo comes with so much responsibility. I cannot just give you the materials and a zoning permit just because you want it. I only give this kind of permission to the most trustworthy people of Dinoalnd."<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Okay, so how do we prove that we are that trustworthy?"<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: "Here. <em>*reaches out for an old manuscript*</em> You two, lay your right hand on the book and raise your left hand."<br>T200 and Benroy each did as the old master told them.<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: "Now, repeat after me. 'I pledge that I will maintain the dignity of my dojo.'"<br><strong>T200 &amp; BENROY</strong>: "I pledge that I will maintain the dignity of my dojo."<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: "'I pledge that I will follow the all the codes of conduct within the Tournament as a dojo master is obliged.'"<br><strong>T200 &amp; BENROY</strong>: "I pledge that I will follow the all the codes of conduct within the Tournament as a dojo master is obliged."<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: "'I pledge that I will shun from all manner of dirty play, and neither will I succumb to resentment towards other dojo masters.'"<br><strong>T200 BENORY</strong>: "I pledge that I will shun from all manner of dirty play, and neither will I succumb to resentment towards other dojo masters."<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: "'I pledge that I will follow and respect the promises I have made as already stated.'"<br><strong>T200 &amp; BENROY</strong>: "I pledge that I will follow and respect the promises I have made as already stated."<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: "Okay, the mateials and zoning permit is at the back of my house."<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Is that it?"<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: "No, that'll be 5,000 coins please." <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                Thanks. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br>Oh, I forgot to mention: the talkshow with Thrust will feature right after this episode, and this time I will be more than glad to accept anyone's questions to Thrust. So if you have somtehing to ask (ex. What's your favorite color? Where were you born? When are you going to have kids with Azelle? O_o, etc.) just send me a PM with your qeustion(s) and they will be featured in the talkshow.<br><br><br>There goes Benroy's tuition fee. (<strong>BEROY</strong>: T___T) I even felt a little sorry for him, but my first priority was to get rid of winter as quickly as possible and welcome the warm spring at last!<br>So we got to work at the dojo. We built it at the Fountain of Youth, thinking that we can get more passers-by to duel with us that way. The construction didn't take long: pretty much all we did was hammer a few planks together, put a large cardboard box on top for the roof, and voila! It was finished! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><br><em>A little while later...</em><br><br><strong>TOURNAMENT ORGANIZER</strong>: ............. "Wow, even Mt.

It didn't look like they had been working.<br><strong>ORGANIZER</strong>: "Well, as much as I hate it, a dojo's a dojo, and so I'm officiating it under who's name?"<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Mine."<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: "No, mine! It's my money!"<br><strong>T200</strong>: "But I'm the leader!"<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: "Hey, how about we call it The Amigo Club?" <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><strong>ORGANIZER</strong>: "The Amigo Club it is.

                Their first would-be contestant just so happened to walk by with her wanwan right after their dojo collapsed. She looked at it with disgust and said:<br><strong>PASSER BY</strong>: "Is <strong>that</strong> supposed to be a dojo?" <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/huh.gif"><br><strong>T200</strong> (impatiently): "Something you don't like?" <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twisted.gif"><br><strong>PASSER BY</strong>: "Yea, I mean look at it! It's so... ewie!"<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Ewie is not even a real word!"<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: "Hey, baby. You look young and 17. Wanna hang out with a <strong>real</strong> korgon?" <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink2.gif"><br><strong>BY PASSER</strong>: "Ew! that's even more ewie!"<br><strong>BY PASSER'S WANWAN</strong>: <em>*growls in disgust*</em><br>Benroy snatched Amigo by the nape and simply carried him off.<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Look, let's just have a dino duel. Do stakes of 3 to 1 sound fair to you?"<br><strong>PASSER BY</strong>: "Are you kidding me? Whateveeeerrr! Rachel and I have no time for losers. Is that right, Rachel?"<br><strong>RACHEL</strong>: "Meow."<br><strong>PASSER BY</strong>: "Ciao, losers. See you at ITT. Oh wait! You're not gonna be there!" <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/lol.gif"> <em>*leaves*</em><br><strong>BENROY</strong>: "What a @#$%&amp;."<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Raise the stakes a little higher, won't ya?"<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: <em>*throws Amigo at her*</em><br><strong>AMIGO</strong> (in the air): "One korgon hug coming up!" <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><strong>PASSER BY</strong>: "Oh crud! No-no-no!!" O_O<br>Smack!<br><strong>BOB</strong>: "Headshot!" <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><br>The other contestants were not as cold as that, but they reviled the dojo as well. The Amigo Club was not getting anywhere!<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Benroy, status report."<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: "We have 0 reputation, 0 merit, 0 points, and we're 2379th in the ranking."<br><strong>EVERYBODY</strong>: "Aaaaaaaawwwwww...!!" &gt;.&lt;<br><strong>T200</strong>: "We've got to advertise. We've got to get other contestants to show interest in us."<br>But as fortune had it, another guy was passing by and noticed their disheveled dojo.<br><strong>GUY</strong>: "Are you tournament participants."<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Why, yes."<br><strong>GUY</strong>: "Cool. I'm looking for dojos to fight, but I don't think that mound of... yea, I don't think that pile you've got yonder can qualify."<br><strong>T200</strong>: "No probs, we got qualified already."<br><strong>GUY</strong>: "Alright then, got a challenge for me?"<br><strong>T200</strong>: "One sec."<br>T200 snatched Thrust with two hands without warning (Thrust was grooming himself when he got snatched off).<br><strong>T200</strong>: "You can duel my first dino, Thrust. He's a wild-bred."<br><strong>GUY</strong>: "He's a wild wanwan? Man, that is so rad! I've always wanted to own a wild-bred dino!"<br>A spark of enlightenment flickered in T200's eyes. Maybe he was finally going to have a duel!<br><strong>T200</strong>: "So what do you say we set the stakes at, maybe... 2 to 1?"<br><strong>GUY</strong>: "Make that 3 to 1."<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Deal."<br><strong>GUY</strong>: "Alright! But I warn ya, my rocky here has never lost a battle yet. He large and bulky, plus he's fast. We have a clean reputation." <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><strong>T200</strong>: "So do we!" (sort of... <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif">)<br>The duel began. The rocky, whose name was Baron, had the first initiative: it first <em>benedicted</em> itself, then fired a <em>lightning</em> bolt for its first move. Thrust <em>dodged</em> the attack and lunged in close to engage in close combat. The rocky didn't seem intimidated, but instead used <em>electrolysis</em> to electrolyze the field and to increase his speed. However, Thrust <em>acceleration</em> skill was so ripe that he could not be hit by the electricity. And when Baron began a series of quick punches Thrust would dodge them so professionally that he seemed invisible at times. Baron tried <em>lightning dance</em>, but all his attacks missed because of Thrust's speed and <em>celerity</em>.<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Quit wasting time, Thrust! One minute left!"<br>Right, it was time to get serious. thrust finally launched a deluge of angr yattacks at Baron; he used his impressive speed to attack him from all sides with his claws, while still dodging the rocky's attacks. His claws eventually found one eye of the rocky, and then the other eyes, and now Baron was blind (rockies don't have nerve cells, so they can't feel pain). And, to finally wrap it up, Thrust stopped and <em>concentrated </em>at the dead center of the rocky's body. He <em>focused</em>, and <em>accelerated</em> for the finishing blow...<br><strong>BOOM!!</strong><br>Time's up! Both duelists were standing, but Baron had received more damage than Thrust. The result was: Thrust was the winner.<br><strong>GUY</strong>: "Awesome!! You know what, I don't even care that I lost, that battle was <strong>exceptional</strong>! I'm telling all my friends about your dojo!"<br>And so he did! His friends told their friends, and their friends told their friends, and so on. Soon, The Amigo Club was full of challengers waiting in a long line. By the end of that day, The Amigo Club's merit was 93.7%, and a ranking of 24th!

                Before they knew it, they were in the qualification phase: the phase in the tournament prior to the IDT. This event, however would not take place in personal dojos; it was being held at BrutForce.<br>When the gang got there, they were amazed at how many participants were attending! there were at least 500 individual dojo masters with all their dinoz together. there was literally not enough room in the whole BrutForce arena to hold them all.<br>Maste Zenith presided over the whole gathering, as our heroes entered BrutForce (and had to orient themselves to the new environment). With a loud and clear voice that could've awoken the drowsy, he announced:<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: "Welcome, masters, to the qualification phase. Within a week is the Inter-Dojo Tournament. This is the time to prove yourselves worthy of the final stages. Only 256 masters can enter the IDT. So, everybody, please have a good night's sleep, get your dinoz ready, and see you inthe morning. I will announce your opponents via post in the morning. The first battle starts at 9 o'clock. Now to your dorms!"<br>That was the end of that.<br><strong>T200</strong>: "Ehh, which dorm number is ours?"<br>But it seemed that that wouldn't matter. Masters fought over the dorms and temporary condominiums, and sometimes things got violent. There was just not enough room to house the whole load of participants...<br><strong>T200</strong>: "You know, I'm kinda used to sleeping outside, even in the winter."<br>That was what T said after witnessing a guy get accidentally hit by <em>lightning</em> from his own dino. (Don't worry, nobody died. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif">)<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: "Me too, man."<br>So they headed outside and set camp.<br><br><em>Later that night...</em><br><br>T200 and Benroy were fast alseep, but not their dinoz. Charge set up a small campfire a little distance away from T200 and Benroy so that the dinozcould have a private chat.<br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: "Ain't much, but it's good. We should keep warm."<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: "So what's the gathering for?"<br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: "Ya might as well ask another dino, sisteh. It's all the same for us."<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: "What I'm worried about is that my master has no idea about fighting in a real tournament."<br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: "Say what, dawg?"<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: "Look, up until now, he's been beating other contestants' dinoz by the advatage in elements, but he's never applied any other strategy."<br>Everybody nodded in agreement to that.<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: "Doesn't any of you think that's being... well... you know, ignorant?"<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: "Ignorant? But Thrust..."<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: "I'm sorry I said that, but my point is that neither T nor Benroy probably know what to do in the upcoming fights."<br><strong>A.C.E.</strong>: "That maybe true for your master, but my master knows everything!"<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: "No, Thrust made a very good point."<br><strong>A.C.E.</strong>: "Shut up 'bout Benroy, girl!"<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: "Whoa, not cool!"<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: "That's no way to talk to a senorita, man."<br><strong>A.C.E.</strong>: "Don't care! Benroy is <strong>my</strong> master and Azelle has never fought in a duel so far. What does she know?"<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: "Watch it there, loudmouth! I was a BrutForce Championness back when I was Benroy's dino, and I was Benroy's dino way before he adopted you!"<br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: "She's right, man. Give it a rest already."<br><strong>A.C.E.</strong>: <em>*grunt*</em> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/dontcare.gif"><br><strong>THRUST</strong>: "What I'm really trying to say is that if our masters are just going to use the old strategy, then we need to design our own and apply them in the duels."<br><strong>NERO</strong>: "You speak wisely, but I must speak negatively about this. Formulating a strategy without observation is pointless. To design a good strategy, we have to look at our opponents first."<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: "Correct, but we can't do that now, can we? We'll just have to do with what we've got."<br>And so they spent the rest of the night formulating strategies...<br><br><br>Sorry for the crappy story today. I've got lots to do these days and I'm trying to find as much time to work on these.

                The dinoz managed to catch 3 hours of sleep that night, and were awakened by the sound of the mailman delivering the newsletter. By now they were wide awake as they proceeded to read the post.<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Oh no…”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “What is it?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Look at this.”<br>Thrust showed the letter to the other dinoz and explained:<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “We’re in the first fight.”<br><strong>WHITE VELD</strong>: “Well, what time is it?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Oh, it’s only 8:45 in the morning.”<br>............<br><strong>EVERYBODY</strong>: “<em>Eight forty-five?!?!</em>”<br>Thrust and Azelle quickly rushed to their master, T200, while A.C.E. ran over to his. They meowed and cawed until the two finally woke up. Thrust grabbed a watch in his mouth and Azelle snatched the newspaper and brought them to T200 as soon as his eyes were open.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “What?! 8:53?! We’re first?! Ben, get up!”<br><strong>BENROY</strong> (lazily): “Eh... what now?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “It’s 8:53 and we’re up!”<br>Benroy quickly jumped out of his sleeping bag and the two of them, without bothering to comb their hair or wash their faces, rushed into the arena with their dinoz. When they got there, they found the arena was already filled with people and their dinoz, all shouting and chanting for a duel as soon as patience allowed. Luckily, for the gang, they managed to squeeze a space for themselves at the very back of the stadium. The view from there was not the best, but they could still see the battles; and at least nobody would see their disheveled states.<br>The Amigo Club’s first opponent was a winks. There was only one minute left until the duel had to start, so T200 though quickly:<br><strong>T200</strong>: “A winks, elements: water and lightning. Weak against wood. Right. White Veld, you’re up!”<br>Timidly, but with haste, White Veld made it to the arena right before the gong was hit, and the fight began.<br><br><u>I’m going to write a brief summary on The Amigo Club’s battles in chronological order, to save me some time.</u><br><br><em>1st Battle</em><br>The winks knew <em>poisoned claws</em>, <em>perception</em> and was almost a <em>sumo</em>. White Veld summoned a barrage of <em>gorilloz spirits</em> to fight the winks. To the winks’s misfortune, it could not <em>concentrate</em> very well, and its <em>perception</em> worked against it this time. It hit one <em>gorilloz spirit</em> to another, but landed only a few hits on its true opponent and could not poison him. White used his barrage of spirits to finally defeat the winks and win the match.<br><br><em>2nd Battle</em><br>Nero was up next against a glidewing. The glidewing did a lot of <em>flying</em> in the duel, but Nero knew almost every A and E skill in the water skill tree, including <em>water cannon, cold shower, gel, Kaar-Sher beam</em>, and <em>petrifaction</em>, and professionally used these skills to knock the glidewing out of the air for an easy win. So far, so good for the Amigo Club.<br><br><em>3rd Battle</em><br>The Amigo Club’s third contestant was Charge, up against a castivorous. The castivorous used a lot of <em>vines</em> in an attempt to hold Charge down, and followed that up with <em>korgon reinforcements</em>, but Charge used <em>burning breath</em> to burn the vines and cook the korgons and finish the duel with <em>blowtorch palm</em>.<br><br><em>4th Battle</em><br>Thrust was up. He was up against a rocky. Thrust used his <em>celerity</em> and <em>agility</em> to try to outsmart the rocky, but to his surprise, the rocky was much quicker than he was. The rocky knew <em>celerity, lightning attack, hazard</em>, and it even knew the wood skill <em>acrobat</em>. all this combined created an amazingly fast rocky that outmatched Thrust’s speed. Thrust used <em>leafy dawn</em>, but he couldn’t cure himself completely before the rocky summoned <em>blazing twilight</em>, ending the match.<br><br>Thrust was defeated, for the first time! He couldn’t lift his head, and it hurt his heart to hear the referee pronouns the rocky victorious. He suffered his way back up the long stairs, limping with every step. Nobody in The Amigo Club said a thing: Thrust just knew that he had disappointed T200. But T200 stroked his wanwan’s head.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “You did your best. Good job, Thrust.”<br>Azelle quickly rushed to Thrust’s side to tend to his wounds, but it didn’t alleviate the fact that Thrust was the only one who lost amongst his peers that day. It made him sick to the stomach, as he moaned to himself:<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “I knew this was going to happen; we need a new strategy...”

                The next day was not as good as their first day. In fact, it was far from that... By now, they were ranking in the 300s.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “I don’t get it! We always had the element advantage, but it almost never worked!”<br>Benroy could not say anything...<br>Thrust was doing well with his injuries, but he would not be ready for another brawl for some time. He silently observed the battles of the other contestants with great <em>concentration</em> and diligent <em>perception</em>. At first, the duels seemed to be unpredictable: dinoz with elemental advantages would often lose to their opponents, and in some cases by a huge margin. But gradually, Thrust began to pick up a “rhythm”. This rhythm was not the advantage of elements, but rather, it so seemed to him, the skills. He observed the sirains: most of them won the duels. This was also true for the rockies, wanwans, kabukis, winks, and even cloudoz.<br>Then, all of a sudden, it hit him! He finally figured out the reason!<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Amigo, come here!”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Un momento, man. This battle is picking up!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “I meant now!”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Si, si, coming...” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/dontcare.gif"><br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Have you noticed how the sirains fight?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “No, but I did notice that senorita sirain who’s fighting right now.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/love.gif"><br><strong>THRUST</strong>: <em>*slaps Amigo with a paw*</em>: “Listen to me! I know why sirains win duels! And rockies, wanwans, kabukis, winks, and cloudoz! It’s not the elemental advantage, it’s the skills.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “So what’s you’re point?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “What’s my point? Look carefully at the battles: sirains tend to win because water has all the good A skills, plus <em>sumo, poisoned claws, aquous clone</em>, and etc.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Oh, I think getting your point now. What else?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Lightning is also a good element for dueling because this element focuses on speed and multiple hits: <em>celerity, lightning attack, lightning dance, double hit, hazard,</em> and double-skills, like <em>electrolysis</em>, <em>overload</em>, and <em>sprint</em>.<br>Wood can be used because of it reinforcement skills, <em>vines</em>, <em>tenacity</em>, and <em>primal state</em>.<br>Air has <em>toxic cloud</em> and <em>fetid breath</em> which can be fatal moves to dinoz without <em>breath of life</em>. And if combined with water, it can create <em>bubble</em>.<br>And fire is good because of its counter-attack skills and <em>torch</em> skill.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Interesting... and you figured out all that just by looking at these fights?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “It wasn’t that hard with my <em>concentration</em> and <em>perception</em> skills. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"> Now go tell T about this before our next duel comes up.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Okey-dokey!” <em>*walks up to T200*</em> “Ei, senor?”<br><strong>T200</strong> (discouragingly): “What...?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Azelle’s pregnant.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/keepcool.gif"><br><em>*Thrust zaps Amigo*</em><br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Ow...!”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Huh...?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “What I meant to say was Thrust knows how to win us duels.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Yea? How?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: <em>*whispers everything into T200’s ear*</em><br><strong>T200</strong> (enlightened): “Is that so?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Si.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Good job, Thrust.” <em>*strokes Thrust’s fur*</em> “I guess there’s only one way to find out...”<br>After that duel, The Amigo Club was up. This time, their opponent was a gorilloz. T200 looked carefully at their dinoz. He was tempted to choose Charge, but the <em>vines</em> and <em>korgon reinforcements</em> would probably spell the softpig’s defeat. The best remedy against that was Nero and his many group attack skills. T200 was reluctant to choose a water type against a wood type, but what was there to lose?<br>Nero stepped proudly into the arena (mostly because he never lost a battle and considered himself the champion of the Amigo Club). When the ell rang, the fight began. As expected, the gorilloz did summon a gunk-load of <em>korgon reinforcements</em> and tried to hold Nero down with <em>vines</em>, but Nero took the this patiently. When he was finally unbound from the <em>vines</em>, he quickly stunned the gorilloz with <em>liquid stumps</em> and, like a wild panther, finished off all the korgons with <em>cold shower</em> and <em>Kaar-Sher beams</em>. With the korgons out of the way, Nero <em>petrified</em> his opponent before the gorilloz could recover from his stun, and battered away with <em>water cannon</em> and <em>gel</em>.<br>Victory! Nero remained undefeated!<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Holy smokes! Thrust was right!”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “No comment, man. No comment.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/eek.gif"><br><strong>T200</strong>: “This could get us out of our problem and into the IDT! Benroy, go back to the Underwater Dome and get as many water, air, and lightning types as you can. Bring a few wood and fire types as well. Be back by tonight or early tomorrow morning.”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “Roger, roger!” <em>*promptly leaves*</em><br>That evening, The Amigo Club had a moderate celebration for this “discovery”. With skill, knowledge, and God’s favor, they were confident that they were gonna make it out alive!

                The reinforcements arrived not a second too late. T200 and the rest of the gang were sure relived to see them: they included Killer60’s Welceon the sirain and Fangstriker’s Fricaya the sirain (their masters came as well). We assembled together into a private meeting for some strategic planning.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “I’m glad you guys made it! Our next battle is just a couple hours from now. I need to know everything that you know about every dino that exists.”<br><strong>FANG</strong>: “But T, you studied Dinoology for at least two years and your plan was to get a Ph.D. We, on the other hand, didn’t study that kind of thing.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “It doesn’t hurt to tell me something that I don’t know.”<br><strong>FANG</strong>: “Well, okay. I’ve had Fricaya for a long time, so I could tell you something about sirains.”<br><strong>BRUNO</strong>: “I can talk about Gorilloz, since my dino is White Veld.”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “And I about pteroz.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Then it’s time for some intel sharing. Everybody, this is very important. We can’t let this harsh weather interfere with communal life. Snow is still here, and it’s almost March, the time when harvesters start working the fields, and they need fertile soil to do that, otherwise Dinoland will starve this year. So let’s now all vow to keep this meeting a secret, so that we can win this tournament and welcome spring.”<br><strong>EVERYBODY</strong>: “Aye!”<br>T200: “Alright, Fang, let’s start with you.”<br><strong>FANG</strong>: “Sirains are known as the best swimmers in all of the dino races. They have more A skills than any other element, and they can be used frequently. This makes them lethal opponents, especially to the dinoz who don’t have as many A skills, can fly, or can summon for reinforcements.”<br><strong>KILLER60</strong>: “Also note that water skills include <em>sumo, poison claws</em>, and <em>aqueous clone</em>. A dino possessing that kind of power is super effective against any dino that does not have <em>breath of life, saving puree, magic resistance,</em> or <em>primal state</em>.”<br><strong>BRUNO</strong>: “Gorilloz are known for their summoning skills, like <em>korgon reinforcements</em> and <em>gorilloz spirit</em>, and can hold an opponent down with <em>vines</em>. These are really effective against any dino that does not have <em>concentration</em>. And if a gorilloz possesses <em>magic resistance</em> or <em>primal state</em>, it can heal itself from poisons and decelerations, and remove the positive stats from an opponent.”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “Pteroz and excellent fliers. They have almost equal power in fire and air, so some pteroz are capable of poisoning their enemies. Their flight skill lets them avoid melee attacks and <em>vines</em>, and their fire skills means they are great against wood-based or water-based dinoz. <em>And</em> if you teach them <em>waikikido, vengeance</em>, and <em>Achilles’ heel</em>, they can learn <em>vendetta</em>. That plus <em>waikikido</em> and <em>vengeance</em> can earn them a 35% chance of counter-attacking an opponent.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Cool. Now it’s my turn to spill my guts. Wanwans are “fast and furious” creatures, capable of many speed skills and <em>korgon reinforcements</em> and <em>vines</em>. Their <em>leafy dawn</em> is also very effective, probably the most effective of all the dino species. Plus, they were some pretty decent A skills: <em>lightning dance, lightning, blazing twilight</em>, and <em>sinuous lightning</em>. To sum it up in a nutshell, wanwans are the most capable dinoz of learning all, or most of, the speed skills, and they can decelerate an opponent with their vines. Isn’t that right, Thrust?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Meow.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “I also know a little bit about kabukis and cloudoz in that both are capable of producing <em>bubble</em>, a very effective skill against dinoz with A skills, especially sirains. Softpigs are very aggressive, and their <em>horned charge</em> can spell disaster to a lot of opponents. The fire element cal also provide fire dinoz, softpigs inclusive, with much initiative and powerful A skills. Glidewings, like the wanwan, can use speed skills, although not as much as the wanwan. However, they are capable of learning <em>overload</em>. That and <em>double-hit</em> combined gives them a 35% chance of a multi-attack.<br>“Well, that’s all that I basically know. Am I missing anything out?”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “I know some things about dinoz. Cloudoz can use almost all the skills of a sirain and can fly and are very quick in attacks. And castivori can poison, use <em>vines</em> and summon reinforcements, and if taught the right way, they can use <em>earth tremor</em>. That’s all I know in a nut sack. Hehe.”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Alright, does anybody need to share anything else?”<br>Nobody stepped forward.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Alright. Let’s get ready for the next battle.”

                It was time to regain the higher ranks that The Amigo Club once enjoyed, this time using their newly adopted strategy into action. With this, they were confident that they could face any specie of dino thrown at them.<br><br><em>Battle against a gorilloz:</em><br>Azelle walked up the arena and faced the gorilloz. At the ring of the bell, the gorilloz did as T200 expected: summon <em>korgon reinforcements</em>. But Azelle was not that kind of wanwan that could easily be tricked. She <em>concentrated</em> at the gorilloz and trapped it in <em>vines</em> before it could send its own vines. With her speed, she quickly defeated the gorilloz, finishing the fight with <em>lightning dance</em>, her signature move.<br>After the fight, The Amigo Club cheered for her victory, all except Thrust, who was still deeply hurt for his loss the other day.<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Thrust?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong> (dully): “Contratulations...” <em>*looks away*</em><br><br><em>Battle against a wanwan:</em><br>This wanwan was fast and new some pretty decent skills in both lightning and wood. Welceon the sirain was chosen to cope with this. The wanwan was fast and was able to <em>dodge</em> some of Welceon’s attacks, but it was not fast enough to <em>dogde</em> the sirain’s <em>poisoned claws</em>. Now poisoned, the vivacious wanwan did its best to keep up with its assaults, but the damagedone by Welceon’s poison was too much for it. Welceon won the match by a landslide and was cheered as the second victor by The Amigo Club, all but Thrust.<br><br><em>Battle against a kabuki:</em><br>White veld was summoned into this battle. T200 knew that the kabuki would have <em>bubble</em>, but he had a different plan, and White Veld was the perfect candidate for this match. You see, <em>bubble</em> only worked on non-wood elemental attacks. Of course, wood did not have any elemental attack, except one — <em>acorn thrower</em>, which White Veld knew. White Veld charge at the kabuki, but many of his attacks did not meet their opponent; the kabuki was too <em>elusive</em> to be hit with melee attacks. So White Veld resorted to his secret weapon: he threw coconut-shaped acorns at the kabuki, which dealt great damage, and won WhiteVeld the match.<br><br><em>Battle against a softpig:</em><br>A.C.E. the pteroz was sent to take care of the softpig. The softpig was quite masterful in <em>waikikido</em> and was a <em>vengeful</em> creature. It also had a nasty habit of setting itself off on fire, a skill called <em>torch</em>. But A.C.E. had the upper hand on this one. The softpig made the first move, but A.C.E. turned <em>immaterial</em> before he could be hit. Then he used <em>mistral</em> and <em>tornado</em>, elements that were strong against fire types. This made the softpig mad. In fact, it made the softpig so mad that it finally tried to use <em>kamikaze</em>. Unfortunately for it, the attack dealt more damage on the softipg than it did to A.C.E. And so, the pteroz emerged victorious.<br><br><em>Battle against a sirain</em><br>The next combatant was a sirain who rarely lost a battle thus far in the tournament, mainly because it was a <em>sumo</em> with <em>poisoned claws</em> and <em>aqueous clone</em>. However, The Amigo Club had the perfect rememdy: one of their backup dinoz was a cloudoz named AU-Gust, which knew <em>breath of life</em>. It proved to be the perfect solution when the sirain tried to poison it with its claws, but failed. All the assaults of its <em>aqueous clones</em> also failed because the cloudoz took to the sky. And to win the match, AU-Gust eliminated the clones with <em>cold shower</em> and poisoned the sirain with its <em>fetid breath</em>. AU-Gust won the match.<br><br><em>Battle with a glidwings:</em><br>By now, Nero had plenty of experience in this. This glidwings, however, was a lot faster than the previous glidwings Nero had fought, and it new how to summon <em>korgon reinforcements</em> like a pro. Nero could not <em>concentrate</em> like a lightning dino: he fired <em>water cannon</em> and <em>gel</em>, but could not hit the glidwings. But finally, at the duel’s last minute, Nero fired a <em>Kaar-Sher beam</em>, knocking out all the korgons, and <em>petrified</em> to glidwings so that it could not move. The rest was... well... to get to the point, Nero won. &gt;;P<br><br><em>Battle with a hippoclamp:</em><br><strong>T200</strong> (taunts): “A hippo? Oh please! Like what can they do? Throttle, would you like to do the honors?”<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Meow!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Meow?” [Wut?! O.o]<br>Throttle skipped happily into the arena and childishly made a pose to “show off” his excellence on battle. However, T200 had underestimated the hippo. Throttle made the first move and fire <em>lightning</em>, but the hippoclamp’s defense was too great, and it’s primary elements were water and wood, both resistant to lightning attacks. Because of Throttle’s inexperience in a real battle, the young wanwan panicked andultimate lost the battle (I don’t want to get into details right now. -_-)<br>This was the only battle that they lost that day. At least Throttle said he was okay, apart from a dizzy head with stars flying around his head.<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “I’m okay...” <em>*faints*</em> @.@<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: &gt;_&gt;<br><br>To be continued some other time...<br><br><br><br><br>Okay, guys. If you’re reading this, I’m gonna need a comment so that I don’t have to use a tiebreaker. That’s four posts in a row, so please be kind enough... please? <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/rolleyes.gif">

                <em>Battle against a moueffe:</em><br>For all The Amigo Club knew, moueffes were similar to their softpig “cousins” in that they both were almost entirely fire dinoz. The difference was that fire consisted of 50% of a moueffe’s elements, so it was a more flexible fighter than the latter. For this, they chose Fricaya, Fangstriker’s sirain. In battle, her style, like Nero’s, also consisted of plenty of A skills which she used effectively on the moueffe, even though fire was supposed to beat water (don’t ask me why <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif">). The moueffe, on the other hand, possessed extraordinary ability with its prime element: it knew <em>burning heart, strength, martial arts, charge, burning claws, fury, ram</em>, and was a <em>brave</em> dino. However, all that came to naught because of Fricaya’s <em>absolute zero</em> skill that protected her from the moueffe’s fiery attacks and secured her victory.<br><br><em>Battle against a winks:</em><br>Seeing this winks in battle, T200 knew that it was gifted in water A skilled and was pretty strong in light too — it knew how to discharge <em>lightning</em> and <em>sinuous lightning</em>. For this sort, they summoned Zendude to do the job, because he had the one skill that could protect him from A skills, that was <em>bubble</em>. Zendude calmly and coolly made his way to the arena and the fight began. The winks fire multiple A attacks almost simultaneously, but they each dealt only 1 hp of damage on the kabuki. With that kind of protection, Zendude was sure to win. However, T200had forgotten that Zendude was the lazy “cool” type who would do nothing but stand around like everything was “A”-okay (<strong>T200</strong>: “Oh, Zendude...” -.-). Although Zendude had <em>bubble</em> he did not inflict any damage himself, so The Amigo Club’s second duel since their new plan was lost...<br><br><em>Battle against a castivorous:</em><br>Softpig took the opportunity to ‘finally pwn somebody’. The castivorous, like a good wood fighter, summoned <em>korgons reinforcements</em> and <em>vines</em> to decrease Charge’s initiative. However, Charge used <em>detonate</em> to counter the castivorous’ <em>vines</em> and used <em>burning breath</em> to take out the korgons. Then the castivorous tried to poison Charge with toxic cloud, but the softpig knew <em>self-control</em> that could counter all negative stats. And since the castivorous was primarily a wood dino, Charge could deal great damage with <em>combustion</em>. That led to Charge’s win.<br><br><em>Battle against a rocky:</em><br>Nero was called again to face the rocky. Again, using his many A skills, he countered the rocky’s powerful lightning attack and was eventually able to slow the rocky down with <em>liquid stumps</em> and a <em>flood</em> deluge. With the rocky losing its initiative, Nero fired a <em>water gun</em> and ended the duel with a close 61% to 63% hp loss, scoring a narrow victory.<br><br><em>Battle against a pteroz:</em><br>Skora, T200’s third personally owned dino (the other two were Thrust and Azelle), was one of the backup dinoz sent from the Underwater Dome and a contestant against this pteroz. The pteroz was an excellent flier and was strong in fire and air attack. However, Skora was also a good flier; plus she had the elemental advantages and was much faster than the pteroz. But what really made her outstanding in combat was her unity of lighting and air skills, which allowed her to learn <em>overload</em>, so she could deliver multiple attacks very frequently. With her speed and fast attacks combined, she quickly dealt enough damage to win at the end of the 5-minute duel.<br><br><em>Battle against a cloudoz:</em><br>T200 had no idea what skills this cloudoz knew for its trilingual knowledge in three elements. He had to debate over this matter with the other which dino to send; however, Thrust had enough of being put aside from a battle. He was still injured, but he got up silently and limped down the stairs to the arena.<br>Azelle, apparently the only one who noticed him going into the field, ran over to stop him.<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Thrust, what are you doing?!”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Back away.”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Look at you! You can’t go out with a broken bone. You’ll get killed!”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Then I guess I’d rather die than be like Achilles sulking in his tent.*”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Thrust, don’t think of yourself as the only loser! You weren’t the only one.”<br>But saying that was Azelle’s big mistake — Thrust <strong>did not</strong> take that kindly. He shoved Azelle out of his way and stormed into the arena.<br>Azelle quickly returned to T200 to warn him about Thrust. In shock, T200 ran down the steps to stop the determined wanwan, but eh was too late, the bell rang, and the battle began.<br>The cloudoz was ruthless! It’s <em>double-hits</em> and A skills did not spare Thrust almost any room to <em>dodge</em>. On Thrust’s part, even though he could <em>jump</em> to intercept the cloudoz in a battle, he could only inflict very little damage. On top of that, the cloudoz knew <em>bubble</em> so it was pretty immune to Thrust’s <em>sinuous lightning</em> — his signature move. But despite all that brutality and a devastated Azelle and T200, Thrust had a plan...<br>By the time 4 minutes had passed, The cloudoz had only lost about 20 hp to Thrust, but Thrust lost more than 50. He glanced at the clock: one minute was all that was left. So the fight ensued until Thrust’s energy was almost depleted. He gave another glance at the clock: 15 seconds remained. The cloudoz was still hammering with its attacks <em>without mercy</em>. Now 10 seconds remained! Thrust stood his ground with as much <em>endurance</em> as he could muster... 7 seconds, 6, 5, 4, 3...<br><strong>THRUST</strong> (to himself): “Now!”<br>With all his remaining strength, he utilized <em>leafy dawn</em> and cured himself right before the clock hit zero...!<br>There was a moment of pause before any applause from the audience. Then, Thrust lifted his head to the screen that dispayed the two dinoz’s hp guage, and to his surprise — with both dinoz having the same amount of maximum hp — Thrust had won by 1 point!<br>The crowd cheered for the amazing victory, and Thrust himself felt like he was liberated from his anguish, as if he had restored his honor in that fight.<br>When he returned to the team, they welcomed him with great delight and a deluge of felicitations. It sure felt like the world had just become a better place, but their battle was not over just yet...

                Sorry if I didn't mention winks. I guess I was too lazy to mention the pros and cons of every single dino in Dino RPG. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/rolleyes.gif"><br><br><br><br>After Thrust’s victory, The Amigo Club had worked their way back up to the top ten ranking (they had a lot more battles than the ones I’ve just mentioned. I mean how the heck can you jump a hundred levels by winning only 12 battles? =D). But their problem was far from over...<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “Hey, T. Look over there.”<br>T200 looked towards the direction Benroy pointed at.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “I don’t see anything.”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “Not over there. <em>There.</em>”<br>T200 looked more carefully in the rows of people sitting across the arena. And sure enough, he saw them — the piglouglous, and right next to them was a santaz.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Looks like we’re finally gonna come face to face with their champion.”<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “Got any idea about santaz?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Umm... none...”<br><strong>BENROY</strong> (sarcastically): “Nice... So what are we gonna do? Just give it a good lickin’* with whatever we’ve got?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “That’s the plan.”<br>Having no knowledge of a santaz’s capabilities, they decided to throw in whatever they had, starting with Azelle.<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Are you confident that you can win this?”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Sure. I was a BrutForce championess once, remember?” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br>With that, she proceeded to the arena in full confidence, but Thrust, deep down in his wild instincts, he felt otherwise...<br>Azelle stepped into the arena to meet her opponent, the champion of the piglouglous. At the ring of the bell, Azelle immediately <em>vined</em> the santaz and displayed a dazzling round of fast attacks, topping that up with her specialty — <em>lightning dance</em>. But the vines didn’t last forever: once they were dry, the santaz broke free and did a <em>plunge attack</em> on Azelle. Strangely, that was the only attack it performed: after that it decided to chill and take the wanwan’s attacks. Azelle did not know what was going on, but after going in for another strike, he realized that she had been poisoned. This was no ordinary poison either — this was the most powerful toxin she had received! Her health was deteriorating at an alarming pace. Within only a minute from that point, she was too sick to fight anymore, and a few seconds after that, she couldn’t even stand. The judges had to call the battle off and pronounce the santaz victorious.<br>Azelle was carted off back to The Amigo Club, where she was met with a devastated crowd.<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Azelle!”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: *coughs* “So... weak...”<br>T200 quickly searched into his rucksack, pulled out a poisonite injection needle, and injected the antidote into Azelle. The toxin immediately vanished, but her strength was still deprived.<br><strong>BENROY</strong>: “It’s a good thing you brought that poisonite injection with you, or else than toxin could’ve killed her. It sure looked that powerful.”<br>T200 was too grim to say anything.<br><strong>THRUST</strong> (worriedly): “Azelle? Will you be alright?”<br>Azelle didn’t say anything, but lie there asleep.<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “She needs her rest, man. If it wasn’t for your master, that poison could have killed her.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “And I know exactly who’s gonna pay for that...” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twisted.gif"><br>Just then, the piglouglous announced that they would accept more challenges from The Amigo Club.<br><strong>T200</strong>: “They’re taunting us! They think they can beat us with Rudolph there! Well then, we’ll give up full power. We’ll see how they’ll like that.”<br>He sent White Veld, in hopes that his <em>gorilloz spirits</em> would distract the santaz and prevent him from being poisoned, but the santaz used <em>toxic</em> and poisoned every one of them.<br>He sent AU-Gust, hoping that his <em>breath of life</em> would win them the battle, but the santaz sent a wave of <em>vacuum disks</em> and a <em>tornado</em>.<br>He sent Nero, praying that his many A-skills would compensate for the santaz’s poison, but it did not: the poison did more damage than Nero’s A-skills. (The same happened with Fricaya.)<br>He sent Welceon, having faith that his <em>poisoned claws</em> would do as much damage as the Santaz’s <em>fetid brath</em>, but it wasn’t as effective.<br>He sent Charge, that maybe he could use his <em>self-control</em> skill could repel the poison, but he was weak against the santaz’s air element.<br>He sent A.C.E., but that proved as fruitless as the rest of T200’s tries.<br>Finally, he sent Thrust, hoping that he would apply the same strategy as last time, but the poison was so strong that he could not heal himself quickly enough before the clock ticked 0.<br>Altogether, T200 wasted 6 poisonite injections, and he was already giving into paranoia. By this time, they had dropped into the 40s ranking.<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: <em>*cough*</em> “How can we stop that?”<br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: “Yea, homey, how the heck did we get involved in this ditch anyway?”<br><strong>WHITE VELD</strong>: “I don’t want to say this now, but I’m losing faith in our chances of victory.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Hold that thought, maybe we still do have a chance.”<br><strong>EVERYBODY</strong>: “What?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Yup, we haven’t tried Zendude yet.”<br><strong>ZENDUDE</strong>: “Yo.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif">

                Okay, guys, last part:<br><br><br>Zendude entered the arena for one final confrontation with the piglouglous’ santaz. Hearts thumped madly in The Amigo Club’s ranks as they watched the two exchange deadly stares. At the start of the fight, the santaz made the first move, throwing <em>vacuum disks</em> at Zendude. The disks had no effect on the kabuki, except for just 1 hp with each hit. Zendude was as chill as ever.<br>So now the santaz decided to go melee and poison Zendude with its <em>fetid breath</em>, but Zendude <em>dodged</em> its every attack, thanks to his exceptional <em>elusiveness</em> and <em>agility</em>. So far, things were looking better than the previous battles with that santaz; nevertheless, Zendude had lost a few hp while the santaz lost none.<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Come on! Com on!”<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Hey, uhh... Thrust?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “What?”<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Can I ask a stupid question?”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: <em>*grunt*</em> “Yea...”<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Why did T200 send Zendude instead of me?” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Because, Throttle. Zendude has this tendency to open <em>black holes</em> at the right time. If he does it this time, we’ll win the wager with the piglouglous.”<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “But I could do myself.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Whatever...”<br>Eventually, Zendude did get poisoned by <em>toxic cloud</em>. For the first time in Thrust’s life, he saw Zendude actually responding to anything — pain. He coughed and grasped his stomach to alleviate the pain as much as he could. The Amigo Club looked on and even started praying that Zendude would use his <em>black hole</em>.<br>One minute remained! Then seemingly in a flash, 30 seconds remained!<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Come on, man!”<br>15 seconds!<br><strong>THRSUT</strong>: “Come on!”<br>But then... he did it! A <em>black hole</em> opened right beneath the santaz’s feet and sucked it into itself. Now that!... That was what they could call a win!<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Yes!!”<br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: “Wooh!”<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Yay!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><strong>WHITE VELD</strong>: “He showed him!”<br><strong>NERO</strong>: “Fortuna was with him!”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “Ei! Mind giving us korgons some credit?” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/rolleyes.gif"><br><strong>AZELLE</strong> (waking up): “Ugh... what just happened?”<br>The Amigo Club burst into celebration, and then the referee stepped in to announce the winner:<br><strong>REFEREE</strong>: “Disqualified!”<br><strong>AMIGO CLUB</strong>: <strong>“WHAT?!?!”</strong> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"><br><strong>REFEREE</strong>: “Zendude used an illegal skill. The santaz remains undefeated.”<br><em>*awkward silence*</em><br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Well, dang. That was a total blowup.<br><strong>EVERYBODY</strong>: <em>*look angrily at Throttle*</em><br>By the end of that battle, The Amigo Club had dropped down to exactly the 50th rank. They were tired, beaten, and disheartened, especially when the Ultra Piglouglou stood up and spoke in a loud voice that:<br><strong>ULTRA PIGLOUGLOU</strong>: “We have won the wager! Winter shall stay until its due time!”<br>And so the gang stepped out of BrutForce, without considering about joining the Iner-Dojo Tournament.<br>But as they made it outside, into the cold chill of the February winter, Master Zenith caught up to them.<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: “Going already?”<br><strong>T200</strong>: “Yea, we just wanted in for the wager, not for the prizes.”<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: “Interesting, because I have a prize for you.”<br>In his hands was a baby dino that looked like a monkey; it was fast asleep in the old man’s arms. He handed it to them, and said:<br><strong>ZENITH</strong>: “For finishing the qualification stage in the top 50, I present to you the tofufu.”<br>With that, he went back inside.<br>T200 and Benroy were sure surprised about this special gift. In fact, they had quite forgotten about their dispute with the piglouglous. So the two of them, and the other humans went back to their pitched tents to pack up for the leave back to the Underwater Dome.<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “You know, I just learned a lesson.”<br><em>*the others pay attention*</em><br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “Winter is not so bad once you get to appreciate it a little more. While we were at odds with the piglouglous to get rid of it, we were forgetting the value behind the winter season. Well, sure it’s cold, but look at the bright side.”<br><strong>NERO</strong>: “He’s right. I can’t believe I did not appreciate something created by the gods.”<br><strong>WHITE VELD</strong>: “Golly! How could I even think about trashing winter?”<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “There’s always Christmas!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><strong>BOB</strong>: “And snowball fights!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><strong>CHARGE</strong>: “I hate to admit it, but I think I’m starting to like winter.”<br><strong>Welceon</strong>: “Back where I came from, winter is considered a holy season.”<br><strong>FRICAYA</strong>: “And my master always loved winter, especially when the snow fell. He always said it was as if the clouds were gently falling and carpeting with ground in white, fluffy fur.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “So why were we trying to get rid of it? I’d say I could survive another month. Spring can wait, ‘cause there’s always room for all four seasons.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: “So let’s <strong>snowball fight!!</strong> Everybody against sirains!” XD<br>And so, they played all day: there was fun and snow for everyone, and they even played into the night, never getting bored of their games.<br><br><em>A little while later...</em><br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Thrust, come here.”<br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “What?”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Look.”<br>Azelle indicated something hanging above the two’s heads — a mistletoe.<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Do you think we should?” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/love.gif"><br><strong>THRUST</strong>: <em>*blush*</em> “Uhh... I... well... umm...”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/love.gif"><br><strong>THRUST</strong>: “I... <em>*gulp*</em> Sorry, I-I don’t think I’m ready yet.”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: &lt;/3 “Well fine!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/evil.gif"> “Hmph!”<br>Thrust was a bit sorry that he said that, but he was firm with his path in life — wiping out the Conquerors and their puppet, Enoch. That was the reason he was hesitant to become dedicated to someone he cared about, because he did not want to leave a broken heart in Azelle, if his time were to come. Too bad she would never understand...<br>Just then, Azelle returned a kissed him in the cheek.<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “I understand. I’m sorry.”<br>So she did understand? Thrust couldn’t feel more relieved. The least he could do, and did, was stand by her side until the end of that day, just to show that he also cared...<br><br><strong>THE END</strong><br><br><br><br>Phew! I've got to figure out how to make these parts a little shorter.<br>Special thanks goes to:<br>Killer60,<br>Fangstriker (even though I didn't get permission from either <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/rolleyes.gif"> )<br>And I'll also give a shout-out to Epoq for helping me get the tofufu when it didn't come after the qualification phase. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>The extra will be tomorrow, and stay tuned for Thorttle's special.<br>See ya.

Actually, come to think about it, you are, Amigo.”<br><strong>AMIGO</strong>: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/eek.gif">... “Cut!”<br><br><strong>THE END</strong>

                You asked for this, guys. This is Throttle's special, and I hope you'll enjoy it, 'cause I made it especially for you. Here's the intro:<br><br><br>Hi, I’m Throttle, arguably the most adorable character in the Under-Dome Series. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/keepcool.gif"><br><cite><strong>THRUST</strong> (sarcastic): “Yea, right...”</cite>And this is my very own special show! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br>I was chosen as the most favorite character of 2010 and so was rewarded with this little special, where I will display my superb talent and cool. Naturally, with my cuddliness and finesse at being simply the best character in the series, I was destined to one day earn my own show, and it is my destiny that this show will one day overshadow that of my cousin.<br><cite><strong>THRUST</strong>: *snicker* “I’m afraid the only thing you’ll overshadow is your own shadow.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/lol.gif"></cite>Well, enough about me, how about a little more of... umm, myself? <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"> <br>I love attention, being petted, spending time with my cousin—<br><cite><strong>THRUST</strong>: “The other cousin, not me. (I hope.)” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"></cite>—getting into trouble, adventure, breaking a few rules and things if I get really bored (I try to do them by accident, see?), and... maybe playing My Brute. When T200’s not writing anything, I like to do pedestrian stuff that little kittens like me are not exactly allowed to do. It’s not that my mom is worried about me, it’s more like she’s worried about the drivers. Did you know that there are more road casualties than there are in the air or on the sea? Well, that’s mostly because of me... <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/redface.gif"><br>Hey, wanna see what trouble I caused today?<br><strong>T200</strong>: “THROTTLE!!!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"><br>O.O ... Uhh... yup, you’ll find out in this special episode. Gotta run now. Bye.<br><em>*Throttle dashes off*</em><br><strong>T200</strong>: “Hey, get back here, fur ball!!” <em>*races after him*</em>

                <u><strong>Episode 6.5: Throttle’s Special</strong></u><br><br>Throttle, alone, was walking through the hallways of the Underwater Dome when he passed a room, from where he saw a faint blue light. He backed up to peak through the half-shut door, and saw...<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “A lifelong supply of Irma’s potions? Wow!”<br>He crept into the dimly lit room and marveled at the illuminating, blue bottles with awestricken eyes and a wide-open smile.<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “You could feed a whole army with this! I guess it won’t hurt to drink just one bottle, would it...? Wait, what did mama say?”<br><cite><strong>ARCTICA</strong>: “Don’t you ever drink Madam Irma’s potions, young wanwan! It has too much caffeine!”</cite><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Hmm... but what would Thrust say?”<br><cite><strong>THRUST</strong>: <strong>“Don’t even think about it!!”</strong> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/chart.gif"></cite><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br>Disappointed, Throttle decided to simple walk past the bottles of Irma’s.<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “I’m just passing through, just passing through... <em>*passes through*</em> I’m just... passing though... <em>*passes through again*</em> I’m just... lookin’, just lookin’ at the bottles... <em>*stares straight into the nearest bottle*</em> just looking, I’m just looking, I’m just... pulling out the cap... <em>*pop!*</em> I’m just look, I’m just looking... and now I’m just... picking it up, just holding it, won’t drink it... I... won’t... drink...”<br>Throttle stared at the bluish liquid for a long time, trying to refrain from giving into his temptation...<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Well, maybe just one.” <em>*chugs*</em><br><br><em>15 bottles later... (<strong>BURP!!!</strong>)</em><br><br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Coca-cola went to town, Diet Pepsi shot him down! Dr. Pepper fixed him up, now we’re drinkin’ 7 Up! 7 Up got the flu! Now we’re drinking Irn Bru. Irn Bru fell down a mountain, now we’re drinking from a fountain. Fountain broke. People choke. Now we’re back to drinking coke! Hahahahahahahahahalololololololololololo l!! Caffeine-caffeine-caffeine-I love caffeine!! Gotta run, gotta fly, gotta bounce, gonna die!! Hahahaha!”<br>And he sped away, high on caffeine...

                Hey, I'm glad you're enjoying it, Scan. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br><br><em>A few hours later...</em><br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: ... “Ugggghhhhh... I feel drained...”<br><strong>Azelle</strong>: “Looks like that caffeine has finally worn out.”<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Hey, what happened? Why do I feel so tired? And... and why am I tied up?”<br><strong>Azelle</strong>: “You drank too many Irma’s potion, when you were clearly told not to.” <em>*unties Throttle*</em><br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Uggghh, I can’t remember anything...”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “I think it’s because you banged your head too many times while you were on caffeine.”<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “I was? Oh... wow... it’s like I’ve got Alzheimer’s.”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “You can’t get Alzheimer’s at your age.”<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Msdfovavnrisjgahw...”<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “Anyway, you need some rest.”<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Sdfwoef... wait, what? No! I don’t wanna sleep! I wanna—”<br>Throttle ran off before Azelle could catch him.<br><strong>AZELLE</strong>: “That wanwan always have to have an <em>adrenaline</em> reserve.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/evil.gif"><br><br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Wow for my first taste of Irma’s! I guess now I know why momma doesn’t me to drink any. I bet coffee is like that, or less. I don’t see adults zapping around like I did from coffee. Madam Irma’s potion — probably the strongest energy drink there is. Hmm... kinda tastes like mint water with herbs and... maybe green tea? Yea, I think it was green tea.”<br>But as he was talking to himself, he accidentally trotted into another unknown room, with a large red button in the center. His curiosity was again piqued.<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Ooh! Big red button! I wonder what it will do if I push it.” <em>*pushes the button*</em><br><strong>SYSTEM</strong>: <em>“Countdown to world demolition.

I know!”<br>Throttle darted into the Irma’s room and drank another 15 potions. In a moment, he was hyped up again, and, believe it or not, started to build a rocket ship as fast as the potions could provide...

The two got inside, then Throttle started the countdown to takeoff. Thrust was a bit impressed with the construction of the ship, but he was doubtful of its authenticity.<br><strong>THRUST</strong> (to himself): “Like this ship is ever going to fly to outer space.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink2.gif"><br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Countdown to takeoff: 10, 9, 8, 6, uhh... 3, 5... 6... umm... oh heck! 2, 1, Liftoff!!”<br><strong>ZOOM!!!</strong> And it really did fly into outer space...<br><strong>THRUST</strong> (taken aback): ... “Umm...

And why did you want me to come with you?”<br><strong>THROTTLE</strong>: “Aww, come on.

                You guys are quite scrupulous about details, aren't you?<br>That's the same Throttle, it's just that I was wroking on this thing on Microsoft Word before posting it here, so that's how I got that error.<br><br><br><br>In other news, I'm quiting writing on Dino RPG. Really, I am, for the following reasons:<br><br>1) I'm finishing up highschool, so I have a mountain-load of work to do.<br><br>2) I'm living in a foreign country.<br><br>3) I got a job.<br><br>4) I'm using my dad's computer to do my work, writing, etc, so I'm saving up my work money to buy my own computer.<br><br>5) I'm attending a language class to learn the language of the country that I am in, and I'm going to get more invovled in it this coming May or June.<br><br>6) My dream is to become a professional writer. I've already written a handful of small novels, most of which are dedicated to my IRL friends. Thrust's Tale and the Under-Dome Series were, you could say, just the beginning of the writing career.<br><br>So pretty much life has caught up to me. I really wish I could write more, 'cause I feel really attached to Thrust and the gang. Sadly, those guys are only a figment of my imagination, so I have to leave them behind.<br>It was fun entertaining you all. One day, I'll look back and say, "Ahh! The good old days..." and wish I was young enough to continue writing.<br><br>Cheer up, there are some good news! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"> <br>Firstly, I'm still gonna play Dino RPG. And secondly, I will be making the UDS episodes on Paradino once a month. Chillax, I'm not entirely gone just yet! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"> Stay tuned for more eposides at Paradino Cinema and watch as the gang take on a whole new misadventure!

                Well T, we will always remember your writing talent. Good luck with your writing carer, Im sure you'll do just great. As for homework, whats new? Im <em>supposed </em> to be doing some right now <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif">. By the way, whats your avatar supposed to be? Ive always wondered but never asked (just a bit random). Ah well, im off to read Thrust 2 again. I never did finish reading the last few chapters.

                Thanks again for all your support, guys. Had you readers not cheered me on, I would have stopped writing a long time ago.<br><br>  And uhh, my avatar was a picture taken through my camera of a little place in Korea when I visited. I can't explain what it is, because it's basically just some place outdoors with people, things, and trees... <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br><br>You know what? I think I'll top up my whole Thrust's Tale thing with one final story: <em>Thrust 3: Reincarnation</em>. But you guys are gonna have to wait until I graduate and get my own computer. What do ya say? Sounds good? <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink2.gif">
