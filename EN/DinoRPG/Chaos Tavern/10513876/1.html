                We're back! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"> And we've got another adventure for you guys to read! Find out what happens in Treacherous Totem right here, so just sit back and enjoy the tale!<br>This first chapter is a prolog that marks the beginning of this story. Enjoy <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">:<br><br>Prologue<br>	<br>The meeting hall of Dinoland Court was crowded and full of life. That is to say, an immense and heated discussion was taking place. Political parties were arguing with each other and debating about the issue of the following war. Yes, DWW3!! Though the Conquerors had lost the second war, they were not defeated...<br>“How long can we keep this up?!” one senator argued, “How long can we bribe the conquerors to prevent another major outbreak?!”<br>“Sooner or later, our economy will plummet!” argued another senator, “And once it does, they will attack!”<br>“Exactly what I said!” the first one agreed.<br>“I say we keep bribing them with our resources!” a third one disputed, “There’s no telling of the majesty of their power, and we do not want to face it!”<br>“But what if they’re bluffing?” a fourth one came into the discussion, “What if they only claim to have a majestic military force, but lack it in reality?”<br>“There’s no point in taking the risk!” the fifth one stated in a loud voice. He was an aged man with a plump stature, and, as many of you call him, he was Grandfather Joe! He had been a senator before, but then retired. However, after the second war, he was reelected as a Neutralist*, since no one could find a more trustworthy politician than him. He continued, “And it is, at the same token, pointless to bribe them with exhaustible resources.”<br>“So what is your solution?” queried the third senator, whose name was Arronway, a hard, Pacifist* of the Dinoland government who favored the bribing of the Conquerors.<br>“My solution is simpler than simplicity itself, but it will take substantial effort to put this solution to practice.”<br>“Are you saying we must summon our national heroes onto a dangerous quest?”<br>“If that’s what it takes to save a nation. Why mustn’t we call upon the skilled who are trained in this field?”<br>There were mutters in the air of Polemists* — those who agreed to the idea — and the Pacifists who oppose the idea. However, the brief debate concluded with the decision that the heroes had to be summoned unto the task. <br>“Then that is our solution to save Dinoland,” said Arronway with a hint of hesitation in his voice, “The mission of these following heroes I will now state is to find the weakness of the Conqueror demons and expose it. The demons are the only reason why the Conquerors are strong. And so they must be nullified.”<br>He read the list through quickly, but clearly. Welceon and Fangstriker were also included in the list. However, Grandfather Joe raised his hand in objection.<br>“Objection!”<br>“I thought this was your solution,” said Arronway.<br>“It is. But I object because you are missing one vital hero: T and his trusty wanwan, Thrust.”<br>“Thrust’s father was a Conqueror demon. And since he is a born-wild dino himself, there is no telling how he will react later on. He might turn against us any moment.”<br>“On the contrary, studies have shown that once a born-wild dino is attached to its master, it will only separate from him once at most. And if they reunite, which is true in the case of those two, then the dino will remain loyal to its master forever. Who here is in favor including T and Thrust unto the said mission?<br>More than half raised their hands.<br>“Then it is done. Let us now give our regards to these entrusted lads and lasses and their dinoz. And let us wish the best of luck to them...and the same goes — to Thrust...”<br><br>-------------------------------<strong>Thrust 2: Treacherous Totem</strong>---------------------------------<br><br>Legend: The Dinoland governemt consisted of three major parties: the Pacifists, the Polemists, ans the Neutralist. Well, ok, not really. I made that up just to spice things up. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>Anyway, the Pacifists were the politicians who favored a nonviolent and passive way of solving things. The Polemists (from the Greek word 'polemos' meaning 'war') were the politicians who favored a more direct and outright solution to things. The Neutralists were consisted of the wisest and most experienced politicians who would favor one side or another depending on which solution was more necessary. In this case, the Neutralists were in favor of the Polemists, since you just can't make peace with the Conquerors.

                Now starts the real story. Enjoy! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>Chapter 1: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_church.gif"> The Reunion <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_church.gif"> (Special thanks to Fangstriker)<br><br>I was a regular University student again, and I was glad about it! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"> Before the war, I couldn’t wait to graduate and get a life of my own. But after the war, it taught me to appreciate the importance of studying, and I began to like it.<br>Just yesterday, we had a big test. The day before that, I was studying hard and reviewing everything that I had learned so that I wouldn’t forget them. And now, we were waiting for our results.<br>Professor Eugene passed through rows of students, handing down their worksheets with the results. I saw him give Fangstriker’s worksheet with an A+ on it. I was sure proud of my new friend! And after a few more rows, Eugene handed down my worksheet. A+! Score! Well, I obtained all that knowledge from experience in the adventure. So, in that sense, I was glad I got to travel the world.<br>“Hey, Fang!” I called out once the lesson was over, “Good job, man!”<br>“You too!” he replied.<br>I returned to my dorm and was greeted by Thrust and Azelle with warm meows and cuddles. I wasted no time after that and got into my homework, despite the following day was the beginning of a spring vacation. After a few hours of studying, I had gotten that homework out of the way. <br><em>Now,</em> I thought to myself, <em>What should I do next? Oh yea! I still have to write a letter to the korgons!</em><br>So I took a sheet of paper, grabbed a pen in my hand, and started writing:<br><br><em>Dear Amigo, Amigos, and Bob,<br>How are things? Sorry I haven’t written anything for a long time. I’ve been doing a lot of studying recently, but I guess that’s not much of an excuse, is it? What about Dian Korgsey? How is she treating you these days? I suspect that your brothers and sisters are praising you for fighting in the war. But what about her?<br>Here? I’m studying. What else can I say? And Thrust? He’s become a little lazy ever since DWW2* ended. In fact, he’s all cuddled up on my bed right now. I guess that’s a wanwan’s nature. I know if Dinoland gets threatened again, he will leap into action. I think you could say that’s one diehard nature of a wanwan. You can’t get them out of bed and you can’t stop them from acting, if you know what I mean.<br>Take care, man! All the best at the camp, there!<br>T<br>P.S. I got an A+ on my test today!</em><br><br>After that, I whistled with my tongue between my fingers and a glidewing (whom I adopted) landed on my windowsill. Her name was Skora. I called her so in honor of Grandfather Joe’s deceased glidewing.<br>“Hey, girl. Could you send this to the Korgon Camp?”<br>She nodded and took off with the letter. Then I sat down at my desk, thinking of something to do this vacation when all of a sudden a stone smashed my window! It made me and the wanwans jump! Somebody had thrown the stone from outside, <strong>and he was going to pay for that window!!</strong> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twisted.gif"><br>But then I noticed that a letter was wrapped around the stone. It was from Amigo! Man, that was quick... <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/surprised.gif"><br><br><em>Dear senor,<br>Amigo here. Good job on that test! Don’t worry, Miss Korgsey has been treating us fine.<br>I know it’s a little too late to talk about Christmas, but Thrust hasn’t been so lazy, you know. I mean we’ve been on a quest on Christmas Eve — a demanding quest — and that should prove that Thrust still has it. He got a new skill for a present: <strong>Leafy dawn</strong>. And we korgons also got what we wanted. Miss Korgsey got a pteroz for Christmas. Boy, is she lucky. But at least she allowed us to borrow it when we need a ride. So that proves to you, senor, that she has been treating us the way we should be (Amigos hit on the head on this line. He says I’m ‘being a too proud son of a gun’...whatever that means).<br>See you really soon, senor,<br>Amigo, Amigos, y Bob</em><br><br>Really soon indeed. I looked out the window...and there they were with Skora!<br>“Amigo!”<br>“Senor! How nice to see you!”<br>I could see a bump on Amigo’s head form Amigos’ blow. But in spite of that, all three of them were happy.<br>“How did you get here?” I asked.<br>“You wouldn’t guess even if I gave you a million years.”<br>“Did you fly by Dian’s pteroz she got for Christmas?”<br>“O_o Man, this guy is a shaman!”<br>“You said it in your letter.”<br>“Oh...so I did... <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/redface.gif"> Si, if I had a purpose in life, it would be flying by pteroz. Hey, catcha later, babeh!”<br>A pteroz behind them shrieked before taking to the sky and heading off for the Korgon Camp. Amigo turned back to me and said, “You know, it’s your spring vacation! Why don’t we, you, the wanwans, Fang, Welceon, and everybody else go out for some spicy merguez pizza, no?”<br>I couldn’t resist, “Sure! <u>After you fix my window</u>!”<br><br>To be continued...<br><br><br>@Fangstriker: I hope you didn't mind...<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif">

                @Waffledog997<br>Lol. We live in a world of randomness @_@<br><br>For the next chapter, I'd like to apologize a bit to Fang for borrowing him without his consent (not yet anyway). I sent him a PM and he hasn't replied yet, so...sorry if this offends you, Fang...<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br><br><br>Chapter 2: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_default.gif"> Called to Duty <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_default.gif"> (Special thanks to Killer60 and Fangstriker)<br><br>We had a super time at Angelucci’s Pizza Haven! It was me, Thrust, Azelle, the korgons, Welceon, Leafblaze, Fangstriker, Fricaya, and Skora. We ordered four large goblin merguez pizzas and ate until our stomachs could burst, and there were still some slices to spare! Angelucci’s also had a bowling alley, so we decided to play a round altogether. The winner would take the leftover pizza home while the loser would pay for everything. It was a pretty even match, but Leafblaze, with his muscular arms, had the upper hand. But I was more surprised to see the korgons rolling the ball as good as either me or Fang. They sure had some touch!<br>But suddenly, my new cell phone rang in the middle of the game. At the same time, Fang’s Dinopedia said, “You have voicemail,” and a glidewings flew in from the window with a letter in its mouth for Welceon.<br>“Hello,” I spoke into the cell.<br>“Dear contactee,” the voicemail played the recording, “you have been appointed as Defense Ambassador of Dinoland by the Dinoland Senate. Your job: Find and expose the weakness of the demons. Reason: Our experts predict that the Conquerors will strike back in the near future. As you know, the Dinoland government has been bribing the conquerors with exhaustible resources in order to delay another war, and now these resources are depleting. The only way to break the conquerors, we must break the demons. You have two weeks to complete your mission.”<br>That was it. Fangstriker’s voicemail and Welceon’s letter said the exact same thing. There was stillness in the air that followed. The only thing I knew was the thought running in my mind, the thought of the Conquerors. It seemed like an hour, although it was only a few minutes, when I stood up and told everyone that I would pay for the dinner and game. And after I took out my wallet and gave the cashier the money, we parted ways.<br>Although I and Fang were heading the same way, we did not say anything to each other. We kept our heads and spirits low all the way. Then we entered our dorms and shut the doors.<br>I sat down at my desk and tensely put my head in my hands. Thrust rubbed his head on mine to try to comfort me, but it didn’t help much.<br>“Thrust,” I breathed while stroking his fur, “we’re gonna have to repeat something we never wanted to repeat.”<br>Thrust gave me a glance into my eyes as the due response.<br>“Come on, how hard should that be? We did it once, so it should be easier this time,” Amigo said.<br>“Amigo, don’t push your luck. You’ve already eaten like 3 slices of pizza, you little korgon,” Amigos stepped up.<br>“Why should I care? I’m the ‘cook’s most wanted’. Angelucci’s even had korgon pizza, for Pizza’s — I mean Pete’s sake!”<br>“Quiet, everyone!” I growled, almost losing my temper. After a few deep breaths, I continued, “We should just all have a good night’s sleep now, and we’ll start our quest first thing in the morning.”<br>At that moment, I received another call. This time, it was from the wise Grandfather Joe. Or should I say...Senator Joe...maybe?<br>“Hello?”<br>“Hello, this is Joe.”<br>“Hey, Joe...Senator Joe, I guess?”<br>“Just call me as you always do. But for now I have something important to tell you. Have you received your voicemail?”<br>“Yea...”<br>“Good. Now listen carefully: do you know Senator Arronway?”<br>“Yea, I see him in the news every day.”<br>“Then you know that he’s a hardcore Pacifist senator and he was acting quite strangely today at the meeting. I’m guessing he may try to stop you. Believe me, I’ve lived long enough to see everything, and I can see through his cunning. Be carefully around him and don’t let him get in your way.”<br>“Yes, sir.”<br>And I hung up.That’s how the day ended. I changed into my pajamas and lied down on my bed with Thrust and Azelle right beside me (the korgons slept on my desk). I closed my eyes and slept the night away...despite that Amigo hadn’t yet fixed my window yet!... &gt;.&lt;

                Thanks, guys. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"> For your support, I'm going to award you with another chapter. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><br><br>Chapter 3: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_fj.gif"> Igor’s Dream <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_fj.gif"><br><br>Day 1<br><br>My alarm clock rang at exactly 5 o’clock am. I wasted no time; I jumped out of my bed and donned my equipment — the same equipment I used our last adventure: the enduring rucksack, the leather gloves on my hands and rope around my shoulder, the buoy in the rucksack, the lighter, some spare pepper grenades, and finally, my trusty knife. I put the collar with the built-in walkie-talkie on Thrust’s neck and then tested it (my end of the receiver was my cell phone).<br>Now we were ready. So as not to wake up the other students of the University, we tiptoed past the dormitories and then past the professors’ dormitories. But then, we heard a disturbing noise in Igor’s dorm. It was supposed to be empty (as Igor was fired for joining forces with the Conquerors). But I was wrong...<br>We crept up to the door, opened it silently, and saw him. He was scavenging through the mess of papers all over his dorm. It only took a moment for him to notice us, but we advanced on him and shoved him forcefully to the wall. I took out my knife and drove it close to his neck!<br>“What did you come back for?!” I spoke aggressively in a low voice, but in such a way that I nearly shouted.<br>“Ia-ia...”<br>“<em>Huh?!</em>”<br>But he couldn’t answer properly.<br>“What’re you...looking for something for the Conquerors?! Or maybe you’re scheming to manipulate the government?”<br>But he pointed at his wall of pictures that all had a sort of landscape in them. I gave him some time to speak, but did not retrieve my knife.<br>“Totem Island!” he finally mouthed out, “Eet’s Totem Island!”<br>“What the heck is this fairytale?”<br>“Eet contains a secret...”<br>“What secret?”<br>He handed me a drawing of the strange dino. It stood on two legs and its fur the most unusual thing I had ever seen. Its face was all black and had two glowing eyes that had no pupils* or irises**.<br>“What is this?”<br>“Te deenoz I am looking for. Te kabuki.”<br>“Kabuki? A kabuki is a Japanese drama, you liar!”<br>“Niet, niet! It’s a real deeno! I swear to Bogh***!”<br>It was most likely that he was lying. But because of my adventurous nature, I decided to give him one more chance.<br>“You’re going there?” I asked.<br>“Da.”<br>“Then take me with you, or else...” I displayed my knife.<br>“Horosho! I’ll take you wit me!”<br>“Pinky swear?”<br>“Da! Da! Pinky swear!”<br>“Oh not with me — with Thrust.”<br>Thrust showed his pinky, which emanated lightning sparks.<br>“Fully grown wanwans can whip up <strong>one million volts</strong>. And that’s far more than enough to kill...”<br>Igor gulped. He nodded tremblingly and gave his pinky to Thrust. That done, he said, “I first need some ingredients.”<br>“Which?”<br>“Five lujidanee groupers, five peleenae leaves, five fur toofts, two basalt fleents, and one air and vater energies. You see, to get to Totem Island, you need a special aura that I can make with deese ingredients”<br>“We’ll find them, but what will you give us in return?”<br>“A kabuki egg. You’ll be te most powerful deeno master een all of Deenoland!”<br>“The most powerful... Wait! What’s this smooth-talking of yours?”<br>“Trust me, eet’s wort it!”<br>I gave Igor a skeptical glance, but decided to believe in him. We tied him in my rope and tugged him along for the adventure...<br><br><br>Pupil* - the the center spot of the eye.<br>Iris** - the colored area of the eye surrounding the pupil.<br>Bogh*** (spelled with English letters) - Russian for 'God'.

                Next chapter. Enjoy! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br><br>Chapter 4: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_5.gif"> Yakuzi <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_5.gif"> (Special thanks to Fangstriker and his Memoirs)<br><br>Amigo already had the pelinae leaves we needed, so all we had to do was get the other stuff. I sent Skora to collect some air energy and left Azelle at the Frish Port to collect water energy — both dinoz used <em>lightning conductor</em>. Next in the list: five lujidanee groupers. We went to the Market Place to buy some, but Igor insisted that he needed not just any kind of grouper. The groupers he needed had to be one week old. We searched hard for those at the market, and we finally found them (Jeez! They were more expensive than the mature groupers! Probably because of their special properties?). <br>Next up: the basalt flint. Again, Igor insisted that he needed pure basalt; a flint that contained <strong>only</strong> the basalt molecules. Well, the purest we could find was high up on the wall of a 90-degree ledge. No biggie though: Bob didn’t mind me throwing him up to the top of the ledge where he tied the end of my rope to a protruding rock. Then, like a hiker, I climbed up and tied the rope around my waist when I reached the pure basalt site and chunked off a few stones with my knife. That done, I climbed down and retrieved my rope (Bob threw it down). Then Amigo shouted out to Bob, “Okay, Bob! Jump and I’ll catch you!”<br>“Okay!...AAAAAAHHHHH!!!!”<br>“I gotcha, buddy! I gotcha!”<br>But he fell and bounced off the ground like a basketball...and only then into Amigo’s hands...and fainted.<br>AMIGO: “See? I told ya he’s more elastic than rubber!”<br>And finally: five fur tufts. Igor told us that he needed wolf fur. But again, not just any fur, but the fur of the elderly and rare white wolves. So we went to the Precipitous Hills where wolves were abundant...and came across a super-pack! We hid ourselves in a thicket where we searched for the white wolves. And in a matter of time, to our good luck, we found five white wolves grouped together in the middle of the pack (it’s a good thing the wolves didn’t notice us with their scent, since it was a windy day).<br>“Thrust, sic ‘em!”<br>On my command, Thrust charged at the pack, sending wolves flying in all directions! When the white wolves only remained, he zapped them down with <em>flash wave</em>*.<br>AMIGO: “Who wants deep-<em>electrifried</em> wolf tonight?”<br>T200 (raising my hand): “I don’t mind. I had wolf meat once, actually...tastes like korgon.”<br>“Wut?! O_O”<br>A remaining wolf howled in agony for his dear leaders and growled at Thrust.<br>“<strong>He</strong> will be avenged, wanwan! <strong>He</strong> will!”<br>“What are you talking about?” Thrust questioned, but the wolf just walked away.<br>Of course, I could not understand a word Thrust meowed, so I asked Amigo for “Translation, Amigo...er, please?”<br>“Stupid wolf talking about a <em>he</em> character. Tontería**...” <br>We stripped the wolves of their fur and then proceeded.<br><br>Skora returned with a capsule of air energy. All that was left was to get to Azelle. So we went to the Frish Port, where Azelle was waiting for us with a capsule of water energy.<br>“Oi, toilet...” said Igor.<br>I allowed to use the restroom, but not without Thrust’s surveillance.<br>As I was waiting — watching the beautiful ocean and letting the wind caress my jacket — someone called from behind:<br>“Psst! Hey, buddy, over here.”<br>I turned my head to the punk.<br>“Wanna play a game of ‘Toss the Coin’?”<br>“I don’t gamble,” I replied plainly.<br>“But I’ve got a special prize for winners...”<br>I didn’t answer to that, but he continued.<br>“It’s a passport to Totem Island.”<br>“You don’t need a passport to Totem Island. You need an aura.”<br>The punk seemed startled at my words. He gave me a shocked glance that made me worry for a moment.<br>“How did you know?”<br>“None of your business.”<br>“No, wait! Please tell me! How did you figure this out?”<br>“Get lost!”<br>I started walking away, but he kept insisting, “Stop! Please! This is very important to me!...Look...if something happens, call me, alright?”<br>I did not want anything from a lowly punk. This lowlife could have been a drug addict or a gangster. Either way, I thought to myself that knowing one’s phone number would not be much of a hassle.<br>“What’s your phone number?” I asked.<br>He gave it to me on a sheet of paper with his scruffy handwriting. After that, he told me to be careful in my journey, as if he knew exactly what I would be going through.<br>He disappeared out of sight; I shook my head in skepticism, but still kept the paper in my hand. Soon afterwards, Igor came back.<br>“What now?” I asked him.<br>“Now I have to make te aura. Eet’ll take me tree days.”<br>“Make it two.”<br>“But I can’t make eet een two days!”<br>“Then <strong>hustle!!</strong>”<br>And so we waited...<br><br><br>Flash wave* - I just realized that flash wave should actually be called sinuous lighting, but I'll keep it as flash wave since it's easier to pronounce and, I think, it sounds cooler.<br>Tontería** - rubbish or foolishness in Spanish

                Here comes another one:<br><br><br>Chapter 5: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"> The Mind Master <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"><br><br>In a cavern, ruled by stalactites and stalagmites, there dwelled a voice of an owner of no body. It lingered in the gloomy cave awaiting its servant to arrive, which he did. And guess who the servant was. It was a Dinoland senator: the same senator that read the list of appointed heroes to the grueling mission...and the one who objected Thrust’s designation — Arronway!<br>“Welcome back,” the voice sounded coldly through the still air.<br>The senator was followed by two demons: a gorilloz and a moueffe. However, this senator was not a follower of the evil voice... In an instant, a mist jetted out of his mouth, ears, and nose and he fell down unconscious. The mist shifted and formed into a black wanwan, all the while the oblivious senator slowly regained consciousness and uttered, “Where...am I?...”<br>“Take him away,” said the wanwan.<br>The demons obeyed without a hint of hesitation; then the voice of the cavern turned its attention to its true servant: “What is it like walking on two legs? You’re used to travel on four.”<br>“I’m getting used to it.”<br>“I suspect <em>manipulating</em>* a human being is no easy task.”<br>“It is so...”<br>“And how did the conference go?”<br>“Bad. Thrust is on our case along with other national heroes. I tried to stop the others from promoting him to the mission, but my voice was overridden.”<br>“Thrust!” the voice growled and hissed at the same time, and then calmed down, “But we have only two weeks to attack Dinoland. He won’t be able to do much with that time.”<br>“On the contrary, Thrust and his master have proven to be very effective against us. That wanwan alone killed three demons at once!”<br>“If only we had Kille back on our side, we might stand a chance...”<br>“But don’t we have other ways of Conquering Dinoland?”<br>“Ha! You ask? With your one-of-a-kind <em>manipulation</em> skill, giving you the title of Mind Master, of course there are chances! And you are not our only hope.”<br>“What does that mean?”<br>The voice stilled for a moment. The wanwan waited for a reply, but then turned around towards the door thinking that the discussion was over. But then the voice sounded again:<br>“Halt...I sense something!”<br>“What is it, master?”<br>The voice momentarily stilled again before inquiring, “Has Igor left our allegiance?”<br>“Not entirely.”<br>“Thrust is with him along with his master.”<br>“Hmm, interesting. What are they doing?”<br>The voice stopped again. And after that pause, it resumed with a pleasing tone in its hissing: “Ahhh, Totem Island...”<br>“The forgotten wonder of the Atlanteid?”<br>“Correct. Igor will buy us precious time. Furthermore, with his discoveries-to-be, we will hit Dinoland harder than ever before. Where are Igor’s dinoz?”<br>“The coral mines.”<br>“Then go and <em>manipulate</em> one of them and send him my message that I would like to use him again.”<br>“Do you think he’ll agree to work with us again?”<br>“Of course. His attachments to us have not yet been severed.”<br>“Then I will go,” said the wanwan.<br>But, again, when it turned towards the door, the voice stopped it, “Your <em>manipulation</em> skill has been very useful to me. And you are the only one who can perform it.”<br>“It’s an honor to serve you, Honorus.”<br>“And it’s an honor to be your master...Enoch...”<br><br>To be continued...<br><br><br>Manipulation* - a skill that I made up. It allows the dino to physically climb into another dino's mind and control it.

                Chapter 6: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_mountain.gif"> Deceived <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_mountain.gif"><br><br>Day 3<br><br>“Is it ready?” I asked the professor Igor.<br>“Da, ready.”<br>In one hand he held a gold circlet*, and in the other a flask of liquid aura which he carefully poured and rubbed onto the headwear. Finally, the ticket to Totem Island was ready. Igor presented the circlet to me and instructed, “Use tis to get to te island. Vizout eet, te Island’s strange atmospheere vill render you stranded on te path from Coral Mines to eet.”<br>“Since when did I allow you to give me instructions?”<br>“Look, if you want to get to Totem Island, you have to use zees ting. Hold eet or wear eet to make your way to te island.”<br>Alright, so we were ready. However, we weren’t letting go of Igor just yet. Just in case if something would go wrong, we’d have him by our side to fix the problem. We escorted ourselves from the Frish Port to Waikiki Island using Igor’s hover-pod, and from there we voyaged to the Coral Mines.<br>Once Igor’s hover-pod was just above the sand of the island, we dismounted the vehicle for a little break. However, he did not leave his pod: A few seconds after we had gotten off, he darted for a cave that was once filled with Atlanteid miners — he was getting away! Thrust <em>accelerated</em> to pursue him, but then stopped and retreated: A monstrous arm smashed the sand, which if it was otherwise might’ve created a violent earthquake!<br>The rest of us caught up with Thrust at this sight. It was then obvious that the arm belonged to a gorilloz — Tanya — one of the three dinoz of Igor. She revealed herself out of the shadows of the cave along with his other two dinoz — Irina an Elena; both were santaz.<br>“Igor! You double-crossing, double-dealing, two-faced warthog!” I snarled at him.<br>“Eet’s vat I do. I hate makeeng deals wiv te enemy! And now, tanks to my dinoz who vere vaiteeng for me, I’ll claim all te glory of being te first man to deescover Totem Island!”<br>“Then go past me! Let’s see how tough you really are, fatty!”<br>Amigo intervened the two of us, “Like how long do we always have to blah blah blah before fighting? Kick butt already! Eh...my butt is optional, so...carry on...”<br>But it was my retort Igor cackled at, not Amigos stupidity. He seemed to be amused by my confidence: “My deenoz are more poverful zan you seenk. I’ll crush you like a bug!”<br><em>Not if I attack first</em> I thought to myself.<br>“Thrust, <em><strong>flash wave!!</strong></em> Azelle, <em><strong>lightning dance!!</strong></em> Skora, <em><strong>saving puree!!</strong></em>”<br>They obeyed. Thrust’s attacked Tanya as his first target, Azelle charged at Irina, and Skora triggered <em> saving puree</em> to protect the group from harmful spells. However, Tanya raised <em>vines</em> from the ground that insulated Thrust’s <em>flash wave</em> course, and Irina turned <em>immaterial</em> so that Azelle could not strike her. Elena, discharged a fog of <em>toxic cloud</em>, but thanks to Skora’s <em>saving puree</em> it did not affect us. Azelle, unable to hit the intangible Irina, turned her attention on Tanya, but she lifted her great arms and blocked all the attacks of the dance.<br>Suddenly, just when I was about to order Thrust to <em>focus</em>, a sort of portal opened up and sucked Skora into its mouth!<br>“What was that?!” I asked in surprise.<br>But before I could get an answer, another portal opened and took Azelle!<br>“<em>Black hole.</em> My trusty santaz must never be underesteemated!” Igor replied with a cackle.<br>With an angry growl, I commanded, “Thrust! <em><strong>Perceive</strong></em> and <em><strong>focus!!</strong></em>”<br>Thrust focus and attacked the immaterial santaz with the same fury as I had. Thanks to his <em>perception</em> skill, he was able to land a bone-crushing blast on each of them. But then Tanya’s strike hurtled him backwards; he landed headfirst to the sand and could hardly stand up afterward.<br>“Irina, one last <em>black hole</em>, please,” Igor said calmly.<br>So the third <em>black hole</em> opened right beneath Thrust’s feet. Only this time Thrust triggered <em>hermetic aura</em> — a force field formed around him in a spherical fashion so that the diameter of the sphere was greater than that of the circular portal. It was a fight between Irina’s <em>black hole</em> and Thrust’s <em>hermetic aura</em>. It seemed like it could be a never-ending battle; on the other hand, Thrust could not sustain his <em>hermetic aura</em> much longer. But to our luck, Irina gave up on trying. At the same time, Thrust was exhausted from battling the <em>black hole</em> and fell to the ground, half-conscious.<br>“There eez no point een conteenueeng te fight,” Igor told his minions.<br>The fight ended there, but it stilled raged on in my heart. Igor and his three dinoz jumped into the hover-pod and took off for Totem Island. I sped after him, taking Thrust in my arms as the korgons mounted on my rucksack. I paddled like crazy (with the buoy in my rucksack), fighting the ocean’s waves, all the while Igor was moving away faster than I was approaching.<br>After about 3 hours of exhaustive paddling, we made it to a small Island that stood in between the Coral Mines and Totem Island. Igor was out of my sight, but I knew which direction he was heading. So we took a quick rest before we swam some more.<br>A dense fog lie before us on the path, but I took it for granted. The only things that lingered in my mind were the disappearances of Azelle and Skora and the aura in my rucksack. But as soon as we entered the fog, a harsh wind blew us into random directions! I could neither tell where we were, nor figure which way we had to go.<br>The wind blew us on a vacant island, and I knew that we were stranded. It was then that I realized that the aura Igor had given me was a fake...

                Sorry for hte little delay. Here's another chapter. Happy reading <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><br><br>Chapter 7: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_church.gif"> The First Flaw <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_church.gif"><br><br>Day 5<br><br>We were stranded on a small island out of the thousands there were in the Atlanteid. And on top of the fact that I was holding a fake aura in my hand, my cell phone battery was dead. We had absolutely no way of contacting anybody for help.<br>I was at full fury inside. Though I did not express it, I was ready to burst at the person responsible for this mess. However, I had no one to blame but myself. It was because of me we wasted 4 precious days, and counting, of our mission. If I had not been tempted by adventure, we would’ve completed our task by now.<br>“This sucks,” Amigo uttered, but to his mistake.<br>At that point, I erupted:<br>“<strong>Shut up!!</strong> Everybody, just shut up!”<br>“Calm down, senor!”<br>“Be quiet! If you hadn’t been such a blabbermouth, none of this would’ve happened! And you, Amigos, if you hadn’t been too critical, we would’ve been much better off! Bob, you’ve been trouble all along. And Thrust...”<br>Just when I turned to him, his wanwan eyes and my eyes met. Those light-green irises of his reminded me of my love for him as a master, so I could not rebuke him.<br> I calmed down before continuing, “With Azelle and Skora gone, and no way of calling for help...”<br>Ring-ring-ring!<br>A ringtone rang in the air...but it wasn’t my cell phone... Amigo pulled out his phone. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/huh.gif"><br>“I knew she’d remember my phone number!”<br>“<strong>AMIIIIGOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!</strong>” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"><br>I chased him ‘round the island until I caught the little imp. (And I shook like a hellhound till he got @_@) I took the cell phone away from him, and phoned for help. Sure enough, just before the sun set, a rescue boat found us and escorted us to the Frish Port, from where we were sent to the Dinoland Police Station (we were Ambassadors of Defense, so they wanted to know what discoveries we have made).<br>The police chief, named Garland — a muscular stature of a man — asked us several question concerning the mission, but my sincere report was nothing but disappointing.<br>“You mean you haven’t discovered anything?” Garland asked in disbelief.<br>“So true...” I answered lowly.<br>“T, how could you? How could you go off when you were assigned an important task, huh? You think this is a joke?”<br>“No, sir.”<br>“Then what? You’ve wasted over a fourth of the time period. In 10 days, we could be under fire. In 10 days, the 3rd war could start. And in 10 days...it could be the beginning of the end.”<br>“Yes, sir.”<br>“Why ‘yes, sir’? If you knew better, you’d understand that you are in no position to even speak. Do you know what I mean — the seriousness of this mission?”<br>I took a few moments to think of something to say. I dug through my memory, looking for even the slightest knowledge I held. But then, I remembered something...<br>“Permission to speak, sir.”<br>“Yes.”<br>“I think I know how to solve this problem.”<br>“You think?”<br>“I cannot promise you that I will complete it, but there is something I know that’ll divulge the weakness of the conqueror demons.”<br>“And that is?”<br>“There is a scroll, called the Demon Scroll that contains every valid information about demons. I once had the scroll, but Kille d’Arkon stole it. All I need to do is find it.”<br>“Are you sure about this? Are you confident that this scroll is the key to Dinoland’s survival?”<br>“Trust me, sir. We just have to find it.”<br>Our conversation lasted longer than that, but it was not as important as the discussion I have written above. We were formerly dismissed out of the station after that, so we returned to my dorm in the University. I was so fatigued from the day that I fell asleep immediately after I lie down on my bed.<br><br>Day 6<br><br>The next morning, I felt like I was recharged to the max. We started the day with some training:<br>“Thrust! <em><strong>Accelerate</strong></em> and <em><strong>focus!!</strong></em>”<br>Thrust <em>accelerated</em> at full speed and headbutted a tree while <em>focused</em>.<br>“Thrust! <em><strong>Hermetic aura</strong></em> and <em><strong>flash wave!!</strong></em>”<br>Thrust’s hermetic aura engirded him as he <em>flash waved</em> a few trees.<br>“Thrust! <em><strong>Hermetic aura</strong></em> and <em><strong>accelerate!!</strong></em>”<br>Thrust bulleted around the university, running 5 laps, while being protected by <em>hermetic aura</em>, in roughly a second.<br>After our morning training, we had some breakfast before discussing about the Demon Scroll.<br>“Where is Kille most likely going to hide that scroll?” I wondered.<br>“God knows,” answered Amigo, “Do I look like a mind reader to you?”<br>“The last time we had the scroll was when Madam X unbound Kille,” proposed Amigos, “It’s very likely that she knows something.”<br>“True, but it’s also likely that she didn’t survive that fight with Master Hydargol,” I said. I recalled the time when the Zenzen headmaster aided me in the duel during the 2nd war. She fell off the balcony, and that made me wonder whether she was still alive. But no matter what propositions we made, none of them were as good as finding Madam X to lead us to the Scroll.<br>So it was decided: we were going to look for the mysterious madam. As we went, I noticed the atmosphere was gloomy and down. I knew it was because I had irrationally scolded everybody the other day, and I could not help but feel ashamed for that. Still, we had a job to do — that was the goal...

                Here are some thing me and the boys did while we were stuck. I hope you like it. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br><br>Bonus Chapter: ... Just Some Things We Did While We Were Stuck ...<br><br>Day 5<br><br>I felt like Robinson Crusoe the next day...except that I had friendly company with me. We spent that boring day trying to do something to amuse ourselves and to kill time...and maybe us if things get too funny. Here’s how day 5 went:<br>T200: “I’m bored...”<br>AMIGO: “Me too...”<br>AMIGOS: “Me too...”<br>THRUST: “Meow...”<br>BOB: “I’m elastic!”<br>O_o<br>T200: “Listen guys, we can’t just sit around here and watch the sun rise and set. We’ve got to do something — something that we can put in our diaries...”<br>AMIGO: “Si, man. I was thinking of doing something myself.”<br>AMIGOS (dully): “Like what?”<br>AMIGO: “Well...we could all play a game of ‘I Spy’...”<br><br>AMIGO: “I spy something...tall and...really tall?”<br>T200: “Uhh...me?” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/dontcare.gif"><br><br>AMIGO: “Okaaayyy, that wasn’t such an exciting game after all.”<br>THRUST: “Meow...”<br>AMIGOS: “Yea, and what a waste of 3 precious hours...”<br>T200: “I know! Why don’t we do something more constructive...uhh...more sportive. How about football?”<br>AMIGOS: “But we don’t have a ball.”<br>AMIGO: No...but we do have plan <strong>B</strong>!”<br><br>THAT’S <strong>B</strong> FOR <strong>BOB</strong><br><br>T200: “Umm...that’s kinda cruel, you know.”<br>AMIGO: “Oh, he doesn’t mind. As long as he’s happy, I’m happy!”<br>T200: “I still think it’s cruel.”<br>AMIGO: “Fine...you’re the boss. But then I’m out of games.”<br>AMIGOS: “How about a more intellectual game. I ask a question, and you have to answer it, ok?<br>We shrugged our shoulders, but agreed.<br>AMIGOS: “Alright. What is the safest thing to do during a lightning storm?”<br>AMIGO: “Raise the white flag?”<br><br>*Lightning flashes*<br>AMIGO (raising white flag): “AAHHHH!!! Okay! Okay!! I surrender!!”<br>ZAP!!!<br><br>AMIGOS: “Uhh...that would be the worst possible option you could choose.”<br>AMIGO: “And whhhhyyyyy? Zeus is angry. So you better be sorry, sucka!”<br>AMIGOS: “Never mind...” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/dontcare.gif"><br>AMIGO (sarcastically): “I know what else we could do! We can just sit here and...maybe sing a song.”<br>THRUST: “Meow.”<br>AMIGO: “Thrust, I was joking. I hate singing!”<br>THRUST: “Meow!”<br>AMIGO: “Seriously! Don’t make me do this!”<br><br>EVERYBODY: “<em>Ama–zing gra-ace,<br>How swe-et the sound<br>That sa-aved a wretch like weeeeee...<br>We o-once were lo-ost,<br>Bu no-ow are found,<br>Were bli-ind, but now<br>We seeeeeeee...and we-e’re still lost...</em> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cry.gif"><br><br>AMIGO (writing his will): “<em>I will never, ever, <strong>ever, EVER</strong> sing again!!!</em>” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/mad.gif"><br>T200: “Dude, maybe we should quite singing and do something else...”<br>THRUST: “Meow...”<br>AMIGO: “If this is will make us look stupid again, I’m gonna use Bob here as a mallet!”<br>T200: “Stupid? There’s no one to watch us, retard.”<br>AMIGO: “Oh yea, that’s right.”<br>THRUST: “Meow.”<br>T200: “Say what?”<br>AMIGO: “Thrust suggested we tell each other a story about ourselves.”<br>T200: “Well, it’s better than nothing. You first, Amigo. Tell us something about yourself before you met us.”<br>AMIGO: “You mean at the Korgon Camp?”<br>T200: “Yea.”<br>AMIGO: “Well...umm...”<br><br>1st KORGON: ...<br>2nd KORGON: ...<br>3rd KORGON: ...<br>...<br>...<br>...<br>1529th KORGON: ...<br>BOB: “TWANY BATS!!!!!!!!!!!”<br>EVERYBODY: “AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!”<br><br>AMIGO: “Si... That never gets old.”<br>T200: “Uhh...wow...I guess... So how did you guys eventually calm down?”<br>AMIGO: “Long story short — it took a long time. What’s your story?”<br>T200: “Me? Before I met Thrust, I...<br><br>T200: *Study, study, study, study, study, study, study, study, eat and sleep, study, study, study, study...*<br><br>T200: “I was quite the studyholic.”<br>AMIGOS: “Stories are boring. Let’s talk about something else... How about games? You guys play any?”<br>AMIGO: “Si. I’m a Runescape fan. Fr33 st00f pl0x!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>T200: “I used to play Runescape until I got bored.”<br>AMIGO: “Why?”<br>T200: “Too much, fighting, killing, and vandalizing. I mean why can’t they install some socially friendly skill that doesn’t have to do anything with fighting 100%? Something like...Tidying skill.”<br>AMIGO: “So it would say something like: ‘<em>Congratulations! You’ve reached level 5! Your Tidiness level is now high enough to scrub the toilet!</em>’ <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/huh.gif"> Maybe that’s why they didn’t install it.”<br>T200: “You guys out there, just to assure you, we’re not advertising. We’re doing this just for the sake of humor. And besides, every knows what Runescape is.”<br>AMIGO: “Who the heck are you talking to?”<br>T200: “Our readers.”<br>AMIGO: “But I thought you said there was nobody to watch us?”<br>T200: “Well...yea...except for the readers...But they’re not really watching...they’re reading...”<br>AMIGO: “You crazy, man! You sure you don’t need help?”<br>T200: “Don’t worry about me. Anyway, back to games. I know a lot of people play Runescape, while others think that Runescape is only for nerds. Some people like WoW, others CS. But as for me, I PLAY DINO RPG!!!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"><br>AMIGO: “What — the — heck...! What’s Dino RPG?”<br>T200: “You don’t know? C’mon it’s everywhere: all around us! I’m a Dino RPG player, and you’re a Dino RPG NPC.”<br>AMIGO: “No I’m not.”<br>T200: “Yes you are.”<br>AMIGO: “No I’m not!”<br>T200: “Yes you are!”<br>AMIGOS: “No he’s not.”<br>T200: “So’re you!”<br>BOB: “I’m an NPC!”<br>AMIGO &amp; AMIGOS: “No you’re not!”<br>T200: “Yes he is!”<br>ALL KORGONS: “So’re you!!”<br>T200: “No I’m not!”<br>ALL KORGONS: “Yes you are!!”<br>THRUST: “Meow.”<br>T200: “You guys are freakin’ annoying! I’m logging off...”<br>... (I disappear) ...<br>AMIGO: “Er...where did he go?”<br>AMIGOS: “No idea...”<br>AMIGO: “Weird... So you guys wanna play Dino Monopoly?”<br>THRUST: “Meow.”<br>AMIGOS: “Heck yea! You got the board?”<br>AMIGO: “I’ve been savin’ it (withdraws a Monopoly board). You first. Role the dice...”<br><br>O_o

                Okay, now back to the topic:<br><br><br>Chapter 8: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_door.gif"> The Mole Hunt <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_door.gif"><br><br>We went back to the police station to ask about Madam X, since she had worked for the law before she betrayed it. The sad thing was that nobody in the station knew that the treacherous madam was in actuality working for the Conquerors...that devious snake! They all thought that she was still on there side.<br><em>Hmm...</em> I thought to myself, <em>If she’s so clever as to make them think she has not betrayed them, then she must tell them her whereabouts.</em><br>“Sir, do you know where she is, then?”<br>“Don’t know. She won’t tell even me,” was the reply of Garland, “I’m not lying, kid. I seriously don’t know her whereabouts. She prefers it that way; she’s the type of agent that doesn’t like to be compromised.”<br>“Got it.”<br>There was nothing more I had to say. Clearly, she was not telling everything, so that meant that she held something against them, but they were blind to that fact. And so we left the station.<br>As we headed off to a random direction, the thought of Azelle and Skora struck me again. I felt uncomfortable carrying on this mission without first going to their aid. Then again, we didn’t have much time in our hands. It was a bit of a dilemma for me, but ‘first thing is first’. I made myself a promise that I would save them after our task was complete.<br>Suddenly, I felt a vibration in the ground! Whatever it was, it must’ve been something huge! We took a few steps forward with caution...hoping to avoid the mysterious beast...but we didn’t. A humongous rocky landed its bulky hand right in front of us! However, there was something familiar about that rocky...<br>It took me a while to recognize the frozen expression of the rocky, but then I cracked the mystery: “Ardown.”<br>“That’s me.”<br>“Still haven’t moved in with the Conquerors then, huh?” I taunted as Thrust hissed at the two of them.<br>“I gotta eat. This is the only way to make money, loyalist*.”<br>“And I gotta eat too; I eat guys like you treasonists*.”<br>“Too bad, ‘cause I’m hungrier. Eternity! <em><strong>Charge!!</strong></em>”<br>Eternity hammered down her fist that was intended for Thrust, but he was too quick. He <em>accelerated</em> around her and <em>focused</em> a rock-cracking blow to her backside.<br>AMIGO: “Woo! Rock <strong>bottom!</strong>”<br>AMIGOS: “That was one striking head<strong>butt</strong>”<br>Bob broke into vivacious laughter.<br>AMIGO: “Bob, I’ll give you one acorn for ever synonym you find for ‘butt’.”<br>Thrust was too quick (and annoying) for the slow Eternity. Ardown was getting annoyed too.<br>“Grrr! Eternity! <em><strong>Blazing Twilight!!</strong></em>” he commanded.<br>The sun darkened in that instant. A second later, five synthetic meteorites were flying towards us! Fortunately, Thrust saw that coming and saved our lives with <em>hermetic aura</em>. But when the darkness died down, Ardown and Eternity were nowhere in sight...<br>“Blast!” I cursed, “I hate <em>blazing twilight!</em>”<br>“Not to fear, senor,” said Amigo, “We’ll just follow his scent trail. Right, Thrust?”<br>Thrust nodded and began to sniff the ground. I slapped my own head in embarrassment: wanwans have an acute sense of smell! How could I forget?<br>We followed Ardown’s scent trail westward, past Dinoplaza, and all the way to Paradino Cinema, a movie theater that was still under construction: a perfect place for, perhaps, Madam X to hide in.<br>“Hehe, thanks, sucker!” I murmured, thinking about Ardown. He must have been such a downer for the Conquerors. He even had the word ‘down’ in his name! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/keepcool.gif"><br>There was an electric fence surrounding the foundation. And from what I could tell, the electric power surging in those wires was enough to kill. The fence was too high to jump over, but crawling underneath it was doable...that is if we insulated the electric flow. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br>I looked around for an insulator to short-circuit the fence. And strangely, I found a metal wire lying not too far from us. (What was a metal wire doing here?)<br>With a pair of twigs, I implanted one end of the wire to the ground and the other I gently placed of the fence. Bolts of electricity shot from it onto the wire — the sign that the discarded castaway was doing its job.<br>“T-60 seconds!” I said, “Go! Go! Go!”<br>We briskly crawled under the fence and made it to the other side.<br>It was as if the place was somehow jinxed, although it was just my imagination. My heart started pumping like crazy the moment we entered hostile ground. I could feel the adrenaline taking its effect on me.<br>Suddenly, we were met with an intimidating roar! We turned around to face the beast, and fell to the ground, overcome by fear...<br><br>To be continued...

                I forgot to mention in the previous chapter:<br>Loyalist* - a Dinolander who stays loyal to his/her nation at times of war.<br>Treasonist** - a Dinolander who betrays his nation to save his/her own butt.<br><br>Next chapter:<br><br><br>Chapter 9: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"> Fire in the Hole! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"><br><br>I didn’t know exactly what it was, but I did study something about them with Professor Eugene. It was a horned smashroom!<br>We barely avoided an earth-shattering blow from the giant’s hefty cap while on the ground. We had to muster up all our courage to get off the ground and run to a safe distance (at least horned smashrooms are slow...phew). But finally we had enough courage and confidence to retaliate.<br>“Thrust! <em><strong>Flash wave!!</strong></em>”<br>A chain lightning issued from Thrust...but it did not affect the monster! Its skin was too thick to feel a thing! I had to come up with another attack plan...<br>“Okay then...<em><strong>Focus</strong></em> and <em><strong>accelerate!!</strong></em>”<br>Thrust’s fur glowed until he looked like a lightning ball, and then he <em>accelerated</em> and hit the monster square on the nose! It showed little affect, but it was better than nothing, so I ordered him to repeat the attack. He hit the horned smashroom in the same spot, and this time it seemed to hurt it more.<br>“Okay, now finish it off with <em><strong>double-hit!!</strong></em>”<br>Thrust obeyed. He climbed onto the beast’s face and began to deal a series of painful and electrifying blows. But then, the horned smashroom sprayed a strange liquid into his face from the pores of its skin. Thrust fell to the ground, coughing and gasping for breath!<br>   At that, we dashed forward to his rescue as the monster raised its cap to deliver the final blow. But as we were running, I heard gunshots fired from behind the smashroom’s back. I had to clear away the chaos and confusion that shrouded my mind, but I realized that they were Conqueror riflemen, there to silence the unruly monster. And it was a good thing they didn’t notice us — so we retrieved Thrust and stole into Paradino Cinema like church mice.<br>   Well...we couldn’t actually go inside the movie theater, so we climbed up to the roof of the unfinished building, which was the place that gave us the most cover from the Conquerors.<br>“This must be it,” I said, since there were Conquerors in the area. And since there were Conquerors in the area, the treasonist, Madam X, was there. The question that remained was ‘why?’, but I didn’t care much about it — I was just there to do my job.<br>“Thrust, are you okay?” I asked with a worried tone, and he replied with a hoarse “Me-eow...”<br>“<em>Contamination,</em>” said Amigo.<br>“Is it deadly?” I asked.<br>“No, but it sucks. We just have to wait until it passes.”<br>“But we mustn’t wait long, or the Conquerors will get us.”<br>“It’s better just to wait and let him rest. He should be ready tomorrow.”<br>So we waited.<br><br>Day 8<br><br>Thrust still didn’t recover. Although he was clearly improving, he wasn’t fit for combat yet.<br>Then, I heard sounds coming from the ventilation system. I crept closer to the pipe to listen carefully.<br>“Where are we going, ma’am?” a voice said.<br>“That I’ll tell you later,” the voice of Madam X replied, “But first, I need you to disguise yourself as a postman and send this letter to the Police Department of Dinoland.”<br>“Yes, ma’am.”<br>“We don’t have much time,” I told the three korgons. I looked all around the place: I could see the car in which the madam’s servant would drive in, a sewer exit, the vent of the building, and whatnot. At that moment, an idea popped up.<br>“Amigo, I need to pretend to be a post-korgon. Can you deliver this (a packaged grenade, which, by the way, I replaced the pepper powder with TNT <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif">) to the front door?”<br>“Si.”<br>“But not just yet.”<br>I cunningly climbed down the building and slithered into the sewer. The other opening was just beneath the car, as I hoped. And without anyone noticing I attached a grenade to the car and timed it to detonate in 1 hour. Then I returned back to the roof through the same route and waited for the car to leave.<br>After that, Amigo was good to go: He put a discarded tuna can on his head as a hat and then knocked on the front door.<br>“Hello,” a Conqueror answered.<br>“Hola, I am your friendly korgon avenger, and I have a delivery for the Señora X.” <br>“I’m sorry, but she’s not expecting anything.”<br>“Uhh...okay...then it’s for you!”<br>“<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/huh.gif">”<br>“Heck with it! It’s for everybody. See, ‘for everybody from everybody’! Here, just take it and sign this...no, wait, don’t sign this! Just take it! Bye-bye! Adios! See you at Armageddon. AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! (runs away like a freak).”<br>“... *Dumb freak*. Hey, guys! We have a delivery!”<br>“What is it?” asked a fellow Conqueror.<br>“It looks small,” said another.<br>“There’s only one way to find out.”<br>...KABOOM!!!...

                Chapter 10: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_5.gif"> The Surprise Attack <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_5.gif"><br><br>The explosion must’ve created a racket in the building, so I quickly made it down and stormed in through the front door. The grenade didn’t kill any Conqueror, but everybody suffered severe injuries — I was clear to take on the madam.<br>I threw another grenade at the door of the room I was looking for...KABOOM!!! Rubble showered down from the walls and ceiling; a hole remained in the barrier between me and the treasonous madam.<br>“Hello again,” I said with a hostile tone.<br>I could see that she was not the same as before. The fall from the fight with Master Hydargol permanently damaged her limbs. She was crippled, but could still walk. Nevertheless, I did not pity her.<br>“Where’s the scroll?” I asked, but she did not answer.<br>I asked her the same thing several more times, each more testily than the other, but she would not utter a word.<br>Finally, I withdrew a grenade and hooked my finger around the trigger.<br>“You better tell me where the scroll is. I know you hid it somewhere.”<br>“I don’t have it,” she spoke at last.<br>“Liar. Who would have hidden it accept you and Kille. And since Kille’s dead, you’re the only suspect.”<br>“Kille hid the scroll, but he did not tell me where it was. It’s not my business, anyhow.”<br>I rattled the grenade in my hand as a warning, “Hear that? Your telling me is your lifesaver! You’d better give it up anyway, ‘cause the police are gonna figure out who you really are. They say secrets have a way of sneaking into the public.”<br>“By the time they realize, I’m going to be out of this dump, and I’m going to be a fulltime servant of the Honorus Arkon.” She turned to me when she ended that sentence. Her face was veiled in scars and she had a nasty gleam in her eyes that reflected her resentment. However, she wasn’t looking at me, rather beyond me...<br>I turned around with the grenade raised up high over my head...two moueffes were there, growling at me like vicious dogs. I took a defensive stance...they slowly approached me...but then, I felt the arm of Madam X wrapped around my neck. And with my own knife, she threatened to put an end to me, the ‘nuisance’.<br>“You’re time has come!” she said.<br>But then, a chain lightning struck the two moueffes down. Thrust, still not fully recovered, came to the rescue along with the korgons...but the madam still did not let go of me.<br>“Stay there, or your master gets it!”<br>“The only one who’s getting anything is you, senora!” retorted Amigo, “Oh, and by the way, you don’t look like a ten to me any more...more like a 4 now.”<br>“Ha! Such amusement from a little korgon!” And then she started expressing her dislike towards korgons in a filibuster*-like manner. I didn’t know what the reason was for this, but the only one she was benefiting was me — her grip around my neck slacked as she talked, and I took the opportunity to steal back my knife and punch her in the temple!<br>“It’s called payback,” I growled at her, pressing my hand on the side of my temple that she hit to indicate this.<br>My punch had felled her to the ground, but, for some reason, she had a smirk on her face. And by the time I realized why, it was too late... The moueffes had recovered from the zap and <em>combusted</em> the floor...it collapsed beneath our feet, exposing us to the abyss below.<br>BOOM!!! We hit the ground as the rubble above poured down on us. Madam X was saved by a pteroz, which acted like a cushion for her, and took off with her and the moueffes.<br>“Thrust!” I commanded while clenching my hip, “<em><strong>Accelerate!!</strong></em> Don’t let them get away!”<br>Thrust obeyed and went after them. He quickly caught up, but had to fight it off with the two moueffes. Their <em>waikikido</em> and <em>vengeance</em> skills made them difficult opponents: Thrust had to fight them from range. He attacked them with <em>flash wave</em>, but they protected themselves with <em>incandescent aura</em>. Then he decided to go melee again and used <em>double-hit</em>, but he retreated just in time when they applied <em>torch</em>. The moueffes then found the opportunity to attack and <em>charged</em> at Thrust, slamming him to a tree. He coughed from the blow and from the <em>contamination</em>, but he did not give up. The moueffes <em>charged</em> again, but this time he opened <em>hermetic aura</em> and electrified the two softpigs at the same time. The battle was won, but Madam X had disappeared from his sight.<br>The distressed wanwan returned to us and healed our pains with his new skill <em>leafy dawn</em>: he stared at our wounds and bruises as his green eyes glowed, utilizing his new healing skill. Then he meowed to me with a down tone to say that she had gotten away. Once again, I was outraged in my heart, but I didn’t want to express it the way I did last time. Instead, I sat and toyed with a couple of stones until I felt at ease, then said, “I guess we’re going to have to find another way of cracking this mystery.”<br><br>The disguised Conqueror arrived at the police station and gave the letter to the Garland.<br>“Ah, yes, thanks,” said the chief, “So Madam X has figured out the origins of demons?”<br>“Hey, I’m just a delivery boy. I only take orders.”<br>“Right. Well, now that that’s done, I guess we can call back the Ambassadors of Defense and call it ‘mission accomplished’. You can go.”<br>The Conqueror made his way towards the car, reached his hand for the handle...and KABOOM!!! The vehicle went sky high in a pedestal of fire! The police officials ran out of the building to see what the commotion was.<br>The chief was the last to come out. After a few seconds and soaking everything in, he commanded, “We have an active terrorist! Find out who he is and compromise his whereabouts! Arrest him for this offence!!”<br><br><br>Filibuster* - a long speech that can last up to several days designed to delay the validation of a new law or a bill.<br><br>Enjoy! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                At least you like ths story. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><br><br>Chapter 11: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_1.gif"> Of the Dark World <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_1.gif"><br><br>We went to a humble restaurant at Dinoplaza (well...the humblest we could find, you know). There, we ate a quick meal and then bought ourselves some simple camping gear.<br>“Why the heck do we need camping gear?” asked Amigo<br>“To save money.”<br>“Darn! We korgons have a religion of our own. ‘You shalt never sleep in a tent.’ It’s like the biggest sin a korgon can make.”<br>“That commandment is outdated, you korgon sausage!” said Amigos.<br>“I stand corrected then. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/redface.gif"> But there is also the most important of all ten laws, ‘You shalt not eat human, but the human shalt eat you.’ So as you can see, I’m not religious.”<br>We slept in our new tent just outside the outskirts of Dinoplaza. However, I could not sleep. <em>I blew it twice already!</em> I though to myself, <em>I can’t let Dinoland down this time. Who would be the one most likely to know where the Demon Scroll is...aside from Madam X?</em> But just as the Madam said, only Kille knew where it was, and he was dead. <em>O-okay then...which of my enemies is closest to me?...Benroy? Bah, the treasonist doesn’t know anything anyway. But I’ve got to use somebody. Ardown? Nah, he’s as stupid as Benroy... Wait! I think I have it!</em><br>“Hey! Amigo!” I whispered as he slept, “<em>Amigo</em>! <strong>Amigo!!</strong>”<br>“Huh?! Wha-what?!”<br>“Are you sleeping?”<br>*-_- “No, but I was dreaming I was on a date with Miss Korgsey...uhh, I mean Amigos! Yea, Amigos!...sort of...” O_o<br>“Well good! Listen, during the second war, when I was captured, how did you meet Azelle?”<br>“We met her at the BrutForce tournament. She was the world champion that year.”<br>“And?”<br>“We forced her to come with us, because she was originally Benroy’s dino. So we thought she knew something about the Conquerors. She hated us at first, but then she fell in love with the wildlife.”<br>“And...did she know anything?”<br>“No. After she found out who Benroy really was, she was completely on our side. Well, I’m tired now, so see you tomorrow.”<br>“Wait! Tell me more! Did she wear some kind of a collar?”<br>“I guess so — I didn’t pay much attention.”<br>“Then that’ll be our third attempt. Nighty-night.”<br>“Si, goodie-nighty,” said Amigo, after which he slipped back to bed and whispered, “Okay, Dian. Where did we stop?”<br><br>Day 9<br><br>We only had not a week left till the deadline. And since this was the third attempt to get things right, we <em>resolved</em> to be successful this time.<br>We went eastward past Dinotown and to the Fountain of Youth, the place where Azelle had most likely lost her collar...and I was right. Thrust, sniffing Azelle’s scent in the air, jumped in excitement, thinking that there was going to be a reunion, but instead found her collar lying half-buried in the ground. I took some fountain water to clean the round metal piece of the Collar, on which was written <em>Azelle</em>. However, the other side of the piece was an ‘address’ of where the collar came from.<br>“The Dark World.”<br>“What?” said the others in unison (Thrust meowed).<br>“The Dark World. D’you guys have a map?”<br>“Maybe it’s the name of the company,” proposed Amigo.<br>I inspected the name a bit — there was something to it that gave it a reputation.<br>“Sounds demonic. This has got to do something with the Conquerors.”<br>“Then maybe we should pass this information to the police?”<br>“Exactly what I was thinking. Come on, guys!”<br>And so we went to the police station to tell them what we knew.<br><br>*   *   *<br><br>“Sir,” the researcher reported to the chief police, “We have discovered whose this fingerprint belongs to.”<br>“Good job! Who is it?”<br>“You don’t want to know.”<br>The researcher handed the result sheet in a shaky manner, as if afraid worried that Garland would burst at any moment.<br>Chief Garland took a moment of silence after he looked at the result. He looked out the window and growled, “T...”

                Lol. I once thought of adopting a demon dino myself and name it Kille d'Arkon, but then I threw it off once I realized that demon wanwans are extremely expensive. Anyway, here's another chapter:<br><br><br>Chapter 12: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_4.gif"> The Conspiracy <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_4.gif"><br><br>Igor and his followers had arrived a few days earlier, but to their misfortune, no kabukis were ever sighted since their arrival. He scanned the island using his satellite scanner, but the strange atmosphere of the island blotted out the vision of the satellite from above.<br>But suddenly...<br>“Vot! I see somesing!” Igor shouted at the top of his lungs. The creature that spied on them was frightened by the noise and quickly disappeared into the trees.<br>The four sped after the creature, which now was completely out of their sight. However, it left footmarks on the ground, making it prone to be found. Soon enough, Igor arrived at an opening in the woods. There he saw an amazing scene: there were kabukis everywhere, like he was inside an enlarged beehive!<br>“Vell, vell...” he smirked, “Looks like ve’ve found te fox.”<br>The kabukis stared at him and retreated away from him to a safe distance. All three of Igor’s dinoz growled and stomped their hoofs to the ground.<br>“Calm down,” commanded Igor, “Let tem get back to zeir beezness. We shall go.”<br>They left the scene and exited the forest. Igor clasped his hands and rubbed them with a greedy tone in his smirk. <em>Soon tis island eez going to be under my control</em>, he thought to himself. All he needed to do was steal a single egg from the kabukis’ noses and control his very own kabuki.<br>See, Totem Island was named for the Totem that stood in the very bull’s-eye of the island (from a bird’s-eye point of view). Whoever had control of the totem had access to the whole island, thus that person would have control over all the inhabitants. However, to do that, one would need a trained kabuki, because the totems essence was only accessible but those creatures.<br>Igor was now developing a scheme to nick a kabuki egg. But as he was doing that, one of his dinoz spoke — something unseen amongst regular dinoz.<br>“Igor!”<br>“Huh? Shto? Who said dat?”<br>“Me!”<br>Igor turned to the possessed dino and fell on his knees in fright, but the possessor meant no harm.<br>“Easy, Igor. This dino is possessed. I am <em>manipulating</em> its mind according to my will.”<br>“But...Bu...B-but who are you?”<br>“The name’s Enoch. I’m part of the Conquerors. Are you still part of it too?”<br>“E-Enoch? H-have vee m-met?”<br>“No, but I’m sure you know Kille, don’t you?”<br>“Ahhh...d-da, I do. Yes, I’m steell part of eet.”<br>“Good, then you will do what we request?”<br>“D-da.”<br>“Then listen, we’re proud that you’ve made it here — this is exactly what we need for our conquest of Dinoland.”<br>“Kabukis?”<br>“Exactly. And we need you to capture us a few eggs, not just one.”<br>“But dat won’t be easy.”<br>“We know, but this <em>is</em> a mission. In no more than a week, a ship will arrive, and by that time you better have at least a dozen eggs.”<br>“But you can’t get here widout an aura.”<br>Enoch didn’t listen. He exited out of the dino’s body in the form of a dark gas and swiftly took the crown with the aura. Turned back to his original form, Enoch replied, “See you in a week, I now have other business I must attend to,” and took off into the air...<br><br>Enoch returned to the Dark World and handed the aura to the head admiral of the Conquerors. After that, he turned to at tied up Senator Arronway and climbed into his mind, <em>manipulating</em> him. The possessed Senator was then untied and he was ready to do Honorus’ work...

                Chapter 13: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cross.gif"> Code 13 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cross.gif"><br><br>“I guess you know where we’re heading now, eh?” I said.<br>Everybody nodded. We were going to report our discovery to the police. Azelle’s collar still had the fingerprint of Benroy. My plan was to notify the police about this so that we could trace Benroy the treasonist and get him to spill his guts about the Conquerors.<br>We arrived a few hours later at the police department. The first person we met (who happened to walk out of the building) was the Garland himself.<br>“Hey, chief!” I called.<br>He gave me an astonished look. Well, I wasn’t surprised about that, but I was worried about his following expression. He seemed to be halfway nervous and halfway angry. There was a hint of some sort of aspiration in his eyes, but he tried to hide it with a welcoming smile...but a sixth sense told me that something was fishy...<br>“Oh...yes. Please come in.”<br>So we followed him inside. But things there got from bad to worse. All the officials there gave us a strange glance. And when I looked back at them, their eyes quickly escaped mine. I really didn’t like the feeling that was inside me.<br>Garland led us into the department’s bureau* full of police officers...that was where I realized my sixth sense was right!...<br>In a flash, the whole room was filled with men pointing their handguns at us! And out of the corner of the room, Senator Arronway revealed himself, greeting us with a nasty smirk. Garland pointed his gun last of all and stated, “T, you are under arrest for murder!”<br>“Murder? What are you talking about?”<br>Thrust hissed and displayed sparks of lighting on his glowing fur; the korgons readied themselves for battle (Amigo grabbed onto Bob’s legs and waved him around like a truncheon**). <br>The chief waved his hand and an officer gave him a file, which he then passed to me. Cautiously, I opened the file and read the through the papers: its words were the evidence of my “wrongdoing”!<br>I tried to explain that it was a Conqueror disguised as a messenger whose car I attached the grenade to, but my mouth was stuck! How irritating! I had all the power I needed to clear myself right on that spot, but I was being restricted by my own lack of confidence!<br>“Any defense on your own behalf, T?” said Arronway very slyly.<br>Again, I tried to mutter even a word, but all I could get out of my mouth were some grunts and incomplete words that made no sense.<br>“Furthermore,” Arronway continued, “your victim was Madam X’s messenger with the information on the demons!”<br>“It’s a fake!” I shouted, finally being able to release some words.<br>“And your proof?”<br>Once again, my mouth was scrambled. I had no hard evidence of this truth. But then...this happened...<br>“Code 13 of the Dinoland Police Academy states that if a national hero commits murder, his crime can only be justified by capital punishment***.”<br>“Whoa! Whoa! Wait! I thought you said I was under arrest, not sentenced to death!”<br>“You are, and your cell is in the other world.”<br>“But shouldn’t I first be going through trial by jury?”<br>“It’s pointless if you don’t have anything to defend yourself with. Garland, do not hesitate. Pull the trigger...”<br>The time I noticed Garland’s finger pulling the trigger to fire at me was the time I felt as if everything was slowing down: you would think that seconds were passing as the chief was pulling on that trigger. I knew it — it was my final chapter...<br>But then, without even my permission, Thrust opened the <em>hermetic aura</em> with such force that it blasted Garland, Arronway, and the surrounding officers off their feet! It was now our chance to escape! We hurried through the corridors of the department as fast as we could, all the while met with hostile police reinforcements. Thrust was about to use <em>flash wave</em>, also without my permission, but I stopped him — I couldn’t afford to be responsible for another human death. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br>The bullets bounced off of Thrust’s protective field as we ran. I trip in the process, ripping the sole of my worn-out shoe, exposing my bare foot to the ground, but we continued running. Soon, however, we found ourselves at a dead end of a metal box-like chamber (I couldn’t find the exit). Realizing that, we turned our attention to the door through which we came, but the danger didn’t come from there...<br>It took us a while to figure that we were in a cage of wild dinoz captured by the DCA (Dinoz Control Agency). Some of them had rabies, others were inherently aggressive, and the rest were infected with other kinds of diseases. They appeared out of the shadows of the corners like phantoms in the night — no wonder we didn’t notice them... They growled at us with their teeth displayed and eyes shooting straight at ours. I began to think hard of a way out: Thrust couldn’t <em>flash wave</em> all of them at once; the korgons were only three and not strong enough; I had some grenades, but since I put TNT in them, the explosion would harm everybody in the cage, including us.<br>Thrust, again without my permission, whipped up some sparks of lightning in his fur and was about to electrify the metal cage. But my bare feet were exposed to the floor!<br>“Thrust! <strong>NO</strong>!!!”<br>Too late: he electrocuted the cage with everybody in it, including me. A burning sensation erupted all around me on the outside and inside for a jiffy, and that the last scene that I saw there...<br><br><br>A couple of points:<br>Bureau* - an office for collecting or distributing news or information<br>Truncheon** - a club carried by police officers<br>Captial Punishment*** (for you guys who don't know what that means) - punishment of death

We were outside, alright; seemingly far away from trouble as I could tell from the nowhere-ness all around. As I looked at myself, I noticed lots of tears on my clothes and burn marks on my skin.<br>Thrust and the three korgons were with me. The korgons, as well, had suffered the consequence of Thrust’s thoughtless action.<br>“Man, Thrust, you busted now!” Amigo said.<br>I rubbed my head, trying to regain my memory, which I did. But I still had no idea how we escaped.<br>“What just happened?” I asked.<br>“Well, Thrust electrocuted their number 2’s along with yours, hehe. That’s basically it. Oh, and we also got you out of there...”<br>“Okay. So where’s Thrust then?”<br>Thrust approached me timidly with his ears flapped down and his chin held low. You could tell that he was aware of his mistake that put his master (me) into jeopardy. He sat down in front of me, gave me a brief glance, and then turned to the ground, ashamed.<br>“Thrust,” I began — he didn’t lift his head — “When I give you an order, you do it. But when I don’t you should consider what you are doing.”<br>Thrust didn’t give an answer, but I could tell that he was listening.<br>“Why didn’t you consider your action?”<br>No answer, not even a meow. I looked at Amigo for translation, but he only shrugged. I thought to myself a bit, and it came to me that Thrust had become too lazy after the second war. Up until that time, from the day we saved Dinoland, we were given much respect as national heroes. Thrust had gotten used to it; so used to it that nothing else started to matter. If I had been a worse master than I was then, I would’ve shouted at him for his grand mistake and punished him severely. But I loved Thrust: I couldn’t do such a thing, but I had to give him a scolding.<br>“Thrust, when this is all over, I’m not going back to the University.”<br>This made Thrust lift his head in wonder.<br>“I’m going to live in isolation, away from people where I will not receive respect as a hero. You, and the korgons, and everybody else, may stay. But I’m leaving.”<br>Thrust meowed and rubbed his head on my stomach, telling me not to go, but I was adamant in my choice.<br>“I don’t know how to punish you severely otherwise, so consider my pain yours.”<br>I finished there...<br><br>For the next few days, we hid ourselves in the hollow tree at the Fountain of Youth. A day before that, we narrowly escaped a search party of legal bounty hunters. They had glidewings, wanwans, and sirains to hear, smell, and see their prized target that was us. Fortunately, the river saved us. And although Thrust hesitated for a moment, he had to listen to me. We dived deep down and allowed the current to carry to where we were now.<br>And so, it was day 13 already. It was hopeless for us. The only hope I <em>did</em> have was in the other national heroes who were working hard for the mission. But then, I heard some grim news: Amigo paid a brief visit to Dinotown where he nicked a newspaper from a newspaper stall and returned.<br>“<em><strong>HEROES BUSTED</strong></em>” Amigo read the title, “<em>On February 24th of this year, the national heroes of Dinoland were entitled Ambassadors of Defense and were entrusted with the mission to discover and expose the weakness of the demons. However, a week later, Chief Garland of the Dinoland Police Academy made a sudden claim that he had the answer: ‘As chief of the most successful law reinforcement academy in the world,’ says Garland, ‘we take extreme precautions of who to trust. It takes one utter sincerity, a darn good mind, and virtuous intentions for the law to win our trust. And having passed all the said requirements, Madam X, our <strong>most</strong> trusted agent, has done so. And so, it is for this reason that we believe in her discoveries to be true, and by carefully studying them, you as well will be convinced.’ This statement seemed spontaneous and impetuous* at first, but after revealing a letter he had received, proving his claim with systematic and graphical explanation, it turned out he indeed has the key.</em>”<br>“It’s a trick!!” I shouted. “For his mistake, now the whole world is gonna fall for it!”<br>Amigo continued, “<em>It was, therefore, a surprising occurrence that all the entrusted Ambassadors of Defense opposed this claim. However, their voices were ignored by the public, leading John McColonel, one of the Ambassadors, and his gorilloz, Armstrong, to attempt to overpower the Police Academy...</em>”<br>“The idiot!”<br>“Consequently, this resulted in the imprisonment of most Ambassadors. Fangstriker and Fricaya, Welceon, and T and Thrust are the remaining refugees that have yet to be captured...”<br>I snatched the paper away from Amigo, scrunched it, and threw it into the fire. The report made me so angry that I wanted to punch Garland square in the nose!<br>But then something smacked my own nose...an abandoned sheet of paper that was carried by the wind. Not just any paper, though, it was a wanted poster...an <strong>outdated</strong> wanted poster of Thrust. I remembered how the Conquerors tried to use it to capture us during the last war. Looking at that picture made me imagine a new wanted poster. It saddened me deeply.<br>At that moment, I let go of all of my anger...we had only one day left, and not even a clue had we found for the cause.<br>“It’s over, boys,” I sighed, “Dinoland is doomed to perish.”<br>“But we can’t give up! We’ve got Thrust!” Amigo protested.<br>“I’m sorry, but not even Hercules with his awesome strength could do this if he existed. We might as well just give up...”<br>Thrust meowed and gave a soft nudge of encouragement on my hand, but it wasn’t good enough.<br>The korgons, as well, tried to talk me out of dismay, but they also failed. Azelle and Skora were gone, we were wanted citizens, and the deadline was not a day away. However...<br>“I do have one person to consult,” I said.<br>“Who’s that?” everybody said in unison (Thrust meowed).<br>“Grandfather Joe...”<br><br><br>Impetuous* - characterized by sudden, irrational action or emotion<br><br>Hope you like it. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                Chapter 15: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_house.gif"> An Old Man’s Perception <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_house.gif"><br><br>Even though Grandfather Joe was now a well-respected senator, he still lived in the humble hut like he always did. Soon after I knocked on the door, Joe came out to see us, and was rather surprised to. The first thing he said to me was, “T? Thrust? What are you doing here? You’ve only got a day left till the deadline, you know!”<br>He was pretty upset, as I could tell from the tone of his voice. I was upset too, so I perfectly understood him.<br>“Grandpa, I’m sorry...”<br>“What do you mean?”<br>I couldn’t find an appropriate answer for that, so I just slightly turned my head away. However, to my relief, he answered his own question for me:<br>“I understand — all our heroes have been blamed for a crime they did not commit...including you.”<br>“You’ve read me through, sir...”<br>“But again, you have less than twenty-four hours left. There is no telling what should happen when the deadlines is reached. We could be attacked by Conqueror demons, and this time we don’t have a clue on how to beat them.”<br>At that, my anger was uncontrollable: “Then why didn’t you do anything?”<br>“Sorry?”<br>“At least you could’ve helped...” I growled.<br>Thrust and the korgons looked at me worryingly, but I paid no attention — everything was on the ‘figurehead’ senator.<br>“I did my best, T. What else could I do?”<br>“By ‘best’, do you mean enjoying a life over others — ‘Senator’ Joe?!”<br>“I would never do that...”<br>“You know, I never wanted to be a national hero! All I wanted was a life of my own! I was a regular student living a regular life, earning a regular living in a regular environment!”<br>“Then why did you do any of this?”<br>“I was in <strong>love</strong>!! Okay?!?! I was in love in my own nation! I did this for my own country! I didn’t want to, but did! If I was given a choice, I might’ve chosen to escape! I gave up everything to save my hometown from destruction! And the only reward I ever wanted was to have my regular life back! But what is this?! I have to give everything up again! I’m sick and tired of everyone looking up to me for advice and-and...and refuge! Why can’t they get it themselves, huh?! Or why can’t they look up to you? You’re now the great senator everyone’s talking about. I just can’t do this anymore! I’m tired; I’m worn out! My energy has been sucked away!”<br>And I had pretty much spent too much energy on shouting. I panted for breath while coughing: all the yelling had made my throat scratchy. At that point, I started to think about what I had just said — it was selfish and ignorant! I had just let all my ego out right in front of the one who might’ve cared for me more than any other human being. I couldn’t say I word — disgrace had zipped up my mouth.<br>But instead of retorting back vehemently, Joe placed his hand on my shoulder and calmly said, “Let it all out. Just take a few breaths and empty your mind.”<br>I tried to do so, but the remaining anger that I had was still burning red.<br>Joe continued, “We need you, T. You and Thrust are the brightest hope that we have. Let me tell you something: After the rain, the sun will shine. Every person will face challenges in their life — that’s nothing special. If you undergo these challenges and emerge victorious, you will be rewarded greatly.”<br>True. I was rewarded greatly after the last war was over — me and my team that is. But now my burden was too great. I didn’t know if I was able to undergo it this time.<br>“I need a long breather,” I said.<br>“What are you talking about?”<br>“I <strong>quit</strong>.”<br>“What?!”<br>“I quit. I’m no longer a national hero. That is no longer my position.<br>“But you cannot quit! Without you, who will be our hope?! You can think of something — you’re the wise one. Me? I need a timeout to think things through...”<br>There was nothing Joe could do to persuade me after that. Not even Thrust could stop me, although he tried his best. I walked out of the castle without a word and returned to the University...<br><br>To be continued...

                Yea, such were the times. A lot has changed and even I can't believe that I had Thrust start out as a mangy alley wanwan.<br><br><br>Chapter 16:  <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_2.gif"> Separate Ways <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_2.gif"><br><br>The clock ticked 0:00. It was midnight — the end of day 14 — and I was packing my stuff for the leave. I was going to join the Zenzen monks in order to take a break and reflect on myself. Unsurprisingly, the others opposed:<br>“What the heck are you doing, man!” said Amigo, “If this is a bailout plan, then you should at least tell us. Or I might as well just hit the cookbook and get sushi’ed up. I hope I’ll be served in a five-start restaurant if that’s the case...(innocent)”<br>“It’s no bailout, guys. I’m quiting.”<br>All three korgons dropped their chins (Bob delayed: Amigos had to explain to him what happened).<br>“That’s it! We’re man-chow for sure! That Madam Squid is gonna eat us and serve us on a silver platter to the king and queen of Dinoland!...and not to mention, Dinoland doesn’t have a monarchy...”<br>I paid no attention. Humans weren’t that heartless...except for a few of them. But now my luggage was all stuffed and I was ready to go. Thrust, for the last time, tried to stop me by standing between me and the door.<br>“Look, this sucks!” said Amigo, “If this means we’re breaking apart as a team, then fine! You don’t want us, then we don’t want you!”<br>Amigo jumped out of the broken window (shouting, “And don’t complain I didn’t fix your windooooowwww!!!” as he fell a few floors and hit the ground with a loud thud). The other two simply walked out of the door...<br>I looked at Thrust with a sorry glance. At that, he knew that I was no longer going to save Dinoland, so he climbed up my desk (used to be my desk) and made his way to the window...then looked at me again.<br>But there was only one thing I could say to him: “Good luck.” And I left.<br><br>Thrust jumped out the window and landed on his feet. Amigo was nowhere to be seen, and the same was with the others. This really did mean the division of the team.<br>On his own, Thrust didn’t know where to start. But then, the scent of Azelle filled his nose... No, she wasn’t around...it was her collar that Benroy gave her. He sniffed it again, longing to see her and Skora again. So he decided to search for them first.<br>He searched high and low, but the darkness of the night was too bothersome. Still, he continued. When dawn arrived, and the pitch-blackness of the night vanished, he started running and calling out Azelle’s name:<br>“Azelle! Azelle!”<br>Suddenly, he saw two dino figures from a distance: a pink wanwan and an orange glidewings... It was them — he was sure! In a burst of joy, he ran towards them, calling their names and jumped right in front of them:<br>“Azelle! Skora!”<br>But it wasn’t them! Though the two looked similar to his friends, they were different. The two young females stared at him with a strange look.<br>“Eww,” said the wanwan bluntly.<br>“Who the heck’re you?” asked the glidewings, but her wanwan girlfriend interrupted.<br>“We don’t talk to strangers. Let’s get out of here.”<br>Thrust stood there, lost in reverie* and thinking of Azelle...<br><br>Meanwhile, the korgons were on their way back to the Korgon Camp. Of course, they still had a long way to go — their little legs were not meant for long distance travelling.<br>“I feel sorry for T,” said Amigo.<br>“Really?” Amigos uttered with a hint of distrust in his voice.<br>“If I didn’t, I would be lying right now!”<br>Bob trailed behind them and complained, “I’m bored!”<br>“Nothing’s fun now,” agreed Amigos, “Criticizing is boring now. Amigo, it’s your fault...”<br>“Thank you...”<br>“Hey, Bob, you stink...”<br>“I stink...”<br>“This stinks! Let’s go back! I don’t want life without Thrust or T!”<br>“He made up his mind already, Amigos,” said Amigo, “It would take God to convince me to go back... (a green giant appears out of nowhere and roars at them) Aaaahhhhhhh!!! Okay, okay!! WE’RE GOING!!!!!!!!! I’m too young to be chow!!!”<br><br><br>Reverie* - a daydream, spacing out, deep in thought

I was waiting for the Zenzen Waterway Express as the chilly air blew past me. About an hour after sunrise, it arrived. The gangplank was dropped and a familiar voice sounded, “All aboard!”<br>It was the young apprentice monk. I greeted him with a simple nod as I boarded (I was the only boarder) and offered him a small tip, which he refused. After that, I put my luggage in my sleeping chamber, and we were off.<br>Despite our modern days, the Zenzens were still using the old Oriental longboats motored by nothing more than wooden rows. And so the journey was slow, yet peaceful... There were no sounds in the air except the calls of the seagulls and the water caressing upon the ship.<br>Our next destination was Coral Mines. We got there about five hours later, so it was already noon. It was then that I remembered something — was my promise to save Azelle and Skora from their imprisonment, and I had a feeling that they were there on Totem Island, which I could not access...not without the aura. However, I knew someone who could...<br>I took out the piece of paper that the punk had given me. My cell phone that I had recharged still had some energy in it, so I dialed the number and waited for a reply.<br>“...Hello?” said the punk’s voice.<br>“Hello, it’s me, remember?”<br>“Huh? Who are you?”<br>“The guys who has your phone number.”<br>“... Oh yea, that guy! Can I help you?”<br>“More than ever. Do you have a speedboat?”<br><br>He did, and we were planing across the water on it right now. I explain everything to him: about Igor, how we tried to stop him, how we got stranded, and about my two dinoz which he took.<br>“Why didn’t you call me earlier? I could’ve done something!” he scolded me.<br>“Sorry. I guess I was being suspicious of you; you know what I mean? So what’s the plan.”<br>“I have two dinoz whom I have trained that are now in Totem Island. Igor doesn’t know that, so I’ll surprise-attack him while you free your two dinoz, and then we’ll finish him off together.”<br>“Nice plan...”<br>Thanks to his aura, we were able to located the isolated island and sneak into it without letting the enemy notice. And since it was a foggy day, fortune was on our side. The Yakuzi (as he told me to call him) led me through the tangling forest. I myself did not know where we were going, but I put my trust on him. Then, we arrived at the location, and I saw the most unusual, but amazing, scene. It was a whole colony of a few hundreds of the dinoz all packed together — the same dinoz as in the picture Igor had in his office!<br>“Who are these guys?” I asked in astonishment.<br>“My inheritance...”<br>“Inheritance?”<br>“Later — look!”<br>Sure enough, the hover-pod with its blinking lights was approaching. We hid ourselves under a thicket, after which the Yakuzi waved his hand downward, signaling the colony of kabukis to pretend we weren’t there.<br>“Dat eez a dozen plius tree,” said Igor to the possessed dino.<br>“Good. The ship should arrive any minute now. Fifteen is more than enough to weaken the defenses of Dinoland. After that, the Conquerors attack.”<br>Yakuzi looked around and then thumped me on the arm, whispering, “Look! I think I see your Dinoz.”<br>I looked carefully at a cage across the field, hidden in thick leaves... It was! It was them: Azelle and Skora! My heart was thumping like I was going to get a heart attack!<br>“Okay, let me distract them first,” said the Yakuzi, “Then you go around the plain and free your dinoz and help me.”<br>“Got it.” So I prepared myself.<br>“Ninjutsu! Kage! <strong>Attack</strong>!!”<br>Out of the cluster of the colony, two kabukis jumped on Igor and his dinoz and took them by surprise. In the meantime, I stole away and around the plain so that I could not be seen. With the first sight of me, Azelle and Skora leaped for joy as I unlocked the cage with my knife. Then we darted right through the crowd of kabukis (who gave way to us, knowing that we were friends). Now all four of our dinoz were fighting Igor’s three. But even without mine, the Yakuzi’s kabukis were awesome! They were <em>elusive</em> and <em>agile</em> — too subtle to be hit! To Igor’s dinoz it was like fighting water: no matter how many attacks they’ve executed, none of them would hit their target! The kabukis soon finished the dinoz, but Igor was the hardest to take down because of his annoying <em>resistance</em>. But finally, Azelle and Skora took him down with a combined <em>lightning attack</em>. His hover-pod failed to <em>resist</em> the blow, and so was taken down.<br>“Igor,” I growled as I approached the fallen figure, “You broke your promise. I guess that means Thrust is going to have to electrify you...”<br>He started to tremble in fear, as he knew what a million volts of death meant.<br>“But since Thrust isn’t with me (Igor started to relax)...Azelle will do the honors. Eh, girl?”<br>Azelle lifted her pinky finger, which gave off sparks of electricity.<br>“Niet...niet! I did tis for te best...best for you! You vouldn’t understand! Nobody does!!!”<br>ZAP!!!<br><br><br>AMIGO: "Voy a comer." <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif">

Kabukis are the rarest dinoz in the world and are now on the brink of extinction. It was only thanks to my early ancestor, the Great Judoki, the kabukis were saved and are just beginning to recover.”<br>“I see... So that’s sort of what when you said this was your <em>inheritance</em>?”<br>“Yes. I was eighteen when I was given the responsibility to care for the kabukis. Back then, I was just a little thug who conned people for money. But this heirloom (showing me the aura) changed my life. All of a sudden, I felt a sense of responsibility and value in my life. I was, honestly, quite relieved that I didn’t have to waste my life away. And these kabukis intrigued me so much that I reared two of them myself; however, at the cost of becoming a thug again.<br>“You see that totem?” he continued.<br>“Yea.”<br>“That’s the reason why you can’t get here without an aura. The totem has a...mystical essence to it, if I may say, that prevents the landing of foreign ‘intruders’. And only with the aura can you break the spell.”<br>“I see. So what about the other aura? What’re you going to do about that?”<br>“That?” The Yakuzi handed it to me, much to my surprise. “It’s yours.”<br>“Mine? Wait! What tells you that you can trust me?”<br>“You’re a national hero, I heard. Plus you trusted me, so why can’t I return the favor?”<br>“It’s because I’m resigning...”<br>“You what?!”<br>Azelle and Skora looked at me with surprise too.<br>“I failed in my mission. And the Conquerors could be on us any moment now. We national heroes have been framed and are under persecution by Dinoland’s own police academy. There’s nothing I can do.”<br>Suddenly, as I was speaking, a loud noise came from the shore not too far away. We ran towards it and saw a Conqueror warship loaded with fifteen kabuki eggs.  Igor’s possessed gorilloz, Tanya, was in command of the operation.<br>“Stop that ship!” the Yakuzi shouted.<br>“Azelle! <em><strong>Accelerate!!</strong></em>” I commanded.<br>Azelle accelerated for the ship as it tried to escape, but she was slowed down by a winks that created a <em>marsh</em> on the sand. The earth-shattering blow of Igor’s possessed gorilloz followed, hurtling Azelle to the sand before my feel.<br>The Yakuzi’s kabukis each threw a <em>vacuum disc</em> at the ship, but they were both intercepted by the gorilloz’s <em>magic resistance</em>, and with a professionally quick motion, it had us all entangled in <em>vines</em>!<br>“It’s over!” the possessed gorilloz said, “Thanks to Igor, the fool... With these kabukis we’ll own Dinoland, and not even Thrust in <em>primal state</em> can stop us!”<br>With that he took off. Skora, who took to flight to avoid the vines, darted for the ship and used <em>focus</em> to punch a hole in it, but she was blown away by a powerful <em>mistral</em> from a pteroz’s wings.<br>“You see that?” the Yakuzi turned to me, “Dinoland needs you!”<br>“It does <strong>not</strong> need me! I am no longer worthy.”<br>“But...you can’t give up!”<br>“You’re not the only one who told me that. I’ve made up my mind.”<br>“But...!”<br>“No. If you want to help me, please return Azelle and Skora back to Dinoland. Thrust is already preparing himself to defend our land, so he needs help.”<br>“But still!”<br>“No...”<br>First Thrust, then Joe, and now the Yakuzi were all persuading me to hold my position. But my mind was firm. I had to leave! The Yakuzi tried to persuade me some more, but he eventually gave up and escorted me back to the Zenzen Waterway Express. Immediately after that, he took my two dinoz back to Dinoland. As for me, I finally arrived at the Zenzen Monastery after a day’s journey. Master Hydargol was surprised to see me, and even more surprised that I wanted to become one of his students for some time. Nevertheless, he accepted me warmly and showed me the ways of a Zenzen monk. My meditational training had begun...<br><br><br>Happy reading...

                Chapter 19: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_door.gif"> Thrust Meets the Yakuzi <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_door.gif"><br><br>Thrust spent another sleepless night trying to find Azelle and Skora. He had practically been everywhere in Dinoland. But then the thought occurred to him that they were probably not in Dinoland at all. What if they were on a different landscape (or waterscape)? So he <em>accelerated</em> down south towards the Frish Port.<br>It was a clear, sunny day, but to him there was only murk. Thrust carefully scanned the bustling streets of the Frish Port. Many times, the scent of freshly caught fish tempted him to fill his gurgling stomach, but he refrained from eating even a bite. (Besides, the merchants would chase him off anyway)<br>After scanning and rescanning the location, Thrust decided on a rest on a vacant dock. The scorching sun heated the air and water, making a humid environment that was hard to breathe in. He looked to his left and saw the same punk, who had tried to con his master, on a speedboat arriving at another dock.<br><em>So what?</em> he thought to himself.<br>But then surprise hit him! Out of the speedboat jumped Azelle! Thrust leaped to his feet and ran over, calling, “Azelle! Azelle!”<br>“Thrust?” she said in astonishment.<br>The two met and locked each other in their embrace like lost siblings.<br>“What happened to you?” asked Thrust.<br>“Been in a little birdcage. I’m fine now, Thrust.”<br>Thrust hugged her tightly again in appreciation for her return.<br>“Wow. I didn’t know wanwans were that affectionate,” said Skora with a simple tone.<br>Thrust laughed and hugged her firmly too.<br>“Agghhh!! Stop! You’re squeezin’ me! (Thrust let go) A bit <em>too</em> affectionate, I guess.”<br>The Yakuzi stepped out the boat and greeted Thrust: “Nice to see you again. You look hungry.”<br><br>The Yakuzi treated them to a sushi bar at the Frish Port. Thrust, having finally found Azelle and Skora, wolfed down his portion as soon as it was given to him. Of course, his two friends being home-raised from birth, Azelle and Skora were quite amazed to see a dino that hungry. But for Thrust, being wild-raised from birth, he didn’t know the meaning of ‘table manners’.<br>After they finished their meal, the Yakuzi put his dishes aside and gave a serious expression.<br>“Thrust,” he said, “have you ever heard of a kabuki?”<br>Thrust shrugged.<br>“It’s a rare dino that you can find only on Totem Island. They’re also shy creatures and they can only reproduce in quiet areas. However, they’re <em>very</em> powerful dinoz. I’ve reared two myself, and they could defeat Igor’s three dinoz without Azelle and Skora if they wanted to.”<br>Azelle explained, “He was fighting Igor while we were being freed by T. We helped him out after that.”<br>The Yakuzi continued, “They’re very <em>elusive</em> — they can dodge an attack just as water flows. They have two key elements: air and water, making them <em>agile</em> and mysterious. Why am I telling you this? It’s because fifteen eggs have been kidnapped!”<br>“Conquerors...” Thrust muttered in his own language.<br>“You see what that means? Somebody is trying to overthrow Dinoland! I doubt fifteen kabukis are enough to take down a whole nation, so I suspect there is more to it. But I don’t know what it is.”<br>But Thrust knew. Now that he got the vital piece of the puzzle, he could fit together everything else. The Conquerors were scheming to weaken Dinoland’s defense from the inside and then launch an all-out external attack.<br>After they left the sushi bar, Thrust, Azelle, and Skora engaged themselves in a discussion:<br>“So we now know what the Conquerors are up to,” said Thrust, “That means we need to find those kidnappers and kidnap those eggs back.”<br>“True, and there are two ways to do that,” added Azelle, “We could go get help, or we could do it ourselves.”<br>“Both of those will take time, and we don’t have that time before the assault.”<br>“What have we got to lose?” said Skora, “We have to do something.”<br>“You’re right. We need to find that ship. Skora, can you fly overwater and it?”<br>“I could, but I can’t <em>perceive</em> as well as you can. You must be the only wanwan that can do a water skill.”<br>“Then we need someone else to do the job...a sirain...”<br>“But who?” asked Azelle.<br>“Two options: Welceon or Fricaya. Who votes for Wecleon.”<br>Only Thrust raised his hand.<br>“Okaaayyy...and Fricaya?”<br>Azelle and Skora raised their hands, outvoting Thrust.<br>“Girls will be girls...(dontcare)” he muttered to himself.<br><br>Meanwhile, the three korgons arrived at the Fountain of Youth after running away from the green giant all night.<br>AMIGOS (panting): “This sucks!”<br>AMIGO: “God, I thought you wanted us to find Thrust! But it seems you created us as man-chow <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cry.gif">. But no! We have a higher purpose! Amigos, give me a coin!”<br>AMIGOS (passing a coin): “And what are you going to do with it?”<br>AMIGO (flipping the coin in the fountain): “I’m going to make a wish upon the fountain! No more running, hiding, and being korgon sausage pizza! Oh great Fountain of Youth! I wish us to find the one and only, if you know what I’m a-talkin’ about, Thrust!”<br>AMIGOS: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/huh.gif"><br>AMIGO: “And to push our good luck, I’m gonna knock on a tree.”<br>AMIGOS: “Uh...Amigo...wouldn’t pushing luck be bad?”<br>AMIGO: “No! With korgons, all is possible. (Knock-knock) See! Good luck, here we come!”<br>GREEN GIANT: (snort)<br>AMIGO: “What the... Oh God! HE WATCHES ALL!!!!”<br>And they were chased southward...

However, how were they to find them? And what if they were captured by Garland? The Yakuzi offered to go with them, but they turned down the offer, thinking it better he stay at the Frish Port just in case...<br>First up: a visit to the Dinoland Police Department...well, more like storming it. Now that the police were their enemy, they were ready to face whatever way an enemy would treat them.<br>As they were <em>accelerating</em> northward, they bumped into the three korgons: exuberance* rushed through their veins to see their friends again!<br>“Amigo! Amigos! Bob!” exclaimed Thrust, “You’re back!”<br>“Please save our little heinie! We’re too Spanish to die!!”<br>The green giant roared right in front of them, but never fear. Thrust jumped on the back of the giant like a rodeo cowboy and gave it a piece of his mind! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"> The beast, unable to take the electrification, shrugged Thrust off of its back and whined as it darted away.<br>“That should take care of it,” Thrust said.<br>“Gracias, man! You’re the best! Or our butts would’ve become a delicacy,” thanked Amigo<br>“Glad you’re here. We’re looking for Fangstriker and Fricaya, and we think that they might be in Garland’s prison cell.”<br>“Well don’t look at me. I may be Spanish, but I’m not omniscient**.”<br>Soon, they all arrived at the Fountain of Youth. Of course, that was not their destination; so they were about to continue on when they spotted two masters with their dinoz digging a hole right under the fountain. They hid themselves in the bushes and listened to their conversation.<br>“What the heck are they doing?” said Amigo, only to be silenced by Thrust.<br>“Did you get it yet?” one of the masters asked his dino, a moueffe.<br>The moueffe shook its head.<br>“The evurtium must be there somewhere,” said the other master whose dino was a feross.<br>“Evurtium?” the concealed dinoz asked themselves.<br>“Ah! There’s some!” exclaimed the first master with the gush of the first sight of water, “Enough for both, ya think?”<br>“Should be. We don’t need much, I think.”<br>“Isn’t that pure water?” Thrust asked Amigo.<br>“It is.”<br>Both masters gave their dinoz a small portion of the water to drink. At first, nothing happened. But as time stretched, some thing changed within the dinoz: the spikes on the moueffe’s arms grew larger and were now coated in venom, and the feross’ armor grew thicker and its tusks turned to steel! Both dinoz turned aggressive and ready to kill.<br>It might’ve been better for them to stay hidden, but there was always the disadvantage in that: “Hola!”<br>Yup, that was Bob... <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/nooo.gif"><br>The <em>mutated</em> dinoz spotted the group. Skora took action immediately without thinking: she <em>flew</em> up high in the air and sped downwards like a hawk, with <em>lightning attack</em>. However, the moueffe and feross combine their energies to create a wall of <em>burning breath</em> to entrap Skora.<br>Now Thrust and Azelle took action: Azelle darted for the moueffe and harassed it with <em>lightning dance</em> while Thrust <em>focused</em> with all his might and headbutted the heavy armor of the feross. The impact hurled the shelled dino a few meters away, but the blow hurt Thrust’s head as well... The wall of fire dissipated, allowing Skora to successfully land a blow to the moueffe. But the battle wasn’t over: as the three grouped together, the moueffe and feross once again combines their energies — this time, they <em>carged</em> together with <em>blowtorch palm</em>. Thrust opened <em>hermetic aura</em> just on time, but the blow was so devastating that it broke the force field around the three! <em>Burning breath</em> followed, but the three escaped the flames...barely...<br>Now Thrust and Azelle teamed up against the feross while Skora <em>flew</em> for another skydiving <em>lightning attack</em>. But the feross hardened its <em>carapace</em> — it again flew a few meters from the impact point, which did nothing to harm it, but the impact harmed both wanwans’ heads. And as Skora <em>accelerated</em> downwards at the moueffe, it used its reflexive <em>waikikido</em> skill to counter the attack — smashing Skora on the side with its bulky arms. After that the two <em>mutated</em> dinoz combines their energies for a third time. Only this time, they sent nightmarish rain of <em>brazier</em> and <em>cold shower</em>. Thrust opened <em>hermetic aura</em> to protect the three, but because of the earlier impact, he couldn’t open it at its full power.<br>As the hellish rain got stronger, Thrust <em>perceived</em> into the mutated dinoz to look for a weakness. But sadly, the only weakness they had was hard to expose. The only option left was:<br>“We need <em>lightning</em> here! The only attack powerful enough to beat them!” proclaimed Thrust.<br>“But we can’t do lightning!” Azelle exclaimed, “We haven’t reached that kind of power level!”<br>“Yea, but if we combine our energies like they did, maybe we can pull it off! Ya with me?”<br>“Heck yea!” said Azelle.<br>“Like I have a choice?” followed Skora.<br>So they packed up tightly together so that their furs touched each other. And like an electric generator, they fired up everything they could until they started glowing like a trio of lightning balls...but it was not enough!<br>“It’s not enough!” Azelle panicked.<br>But the three korgons, hiding under a whimsical orchid’s petal, offered help: “We korgons knows a little bit of lightning, you know?” said Amigo<br>“You do?” asked Thrust with a bit of relief.<br>“Si. Of course, we’re not very good at it, so it’s kind of a sausage party for us when it comes to lightning, but anyway... Let’ get in there, boys!!”<br>The korgons jumped inside the shield and added their energies to the concoctions. Despite the little energy they could provide, it was enough! A <em>lightning</em> bolt shot down from the sky, instantly paralyzing the moueffe!<br>“Great! One more!”<br>They fired another <em>lightning</em> on the feross, leaving it in paralysis and winning the battle!<br>The two masters, in shock, grabbed onto their dinoz and dragged them away. Thrust could’ve easily owned them on the spot, but he decided to go easy on the jerks. But as of the water, and the element ‘evurtium’, there was a mystery. Thrust sniffed some of the spilled water: its scent was very familiar...<br>“Whatever it was,” said Azelle, “they didn’t drink enough of it to beat us.”<br>“Indeed,” a feminine voice said from behind them. At first, Thrust thought it was Skora, but as he looked behind her, he noticed that it was someone else...<br>“Fricaya?”...<br><br><br>Hope you like it. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif">

                Sorry I didn't post yesterday. I was a little sick. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br>I also thought it would be better if I gave you guys time to catch up, so it is for these two reason I didn't post.<br>BTW, I forgot to explain the two highlighted words in the last chapter.<br><br>Exuberance* - energy, enthusiasm<br>Omniscient** - all-knowing, knows everything there is to know<br><br><br>And now for the next chapter:<br><br><br><br>Chapter 21: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"> Rammed <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"> (Special thanks to Fangstriker and Killer60)<br><br>“Yea, it’s me,” said Fricaya, rather halfheartedly, and with an unusual accent.<br>“Is it really you?” asked Azelle.<br>“Yes, it is.”<br>“But where’s Fang?” Thrust inquired.<br>“Who? Oh, uh...my hubby’s not feeling good, so...”<br>“Hubby? <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/huh.gif">” they repeated in unison. <br>“Uh...er...”<br>“Anyway, we’re on a very tight schedule and you’re just the dino we’ve been looking for,” Azelle intervened, “We thought you might help looking for this certain ship.”<br>“A ship? Depends. What kind of ship are we talking about?.”<br>“We don’t know, and that’s the problem. That’s why we need your <em>sharp eyes</em> to scout it out.”<br>“Si, we can start with the Titanic,” proposed Amigo, going off topic.<br>But Amigos’ response was, “That’s on earth. What, Dinoland isn’t good enough for ye, sicko?”<br>“Well...I can...and I can’t...”<br>“What’re you talking about? You’re a sirain,” said Thrust.<br>“No I’m not...”<br>“Yea, you are!”<br>“Oh, I mean uhh...yea, yea I am...err...”<br>“You...never mind...(dontcare)”<br>Thrust scratched his head and whispered into Azelle’s ear, “Don’t you think there’s something strange with Fricie? She’s acting weird. And how can she just change her accent like that?”<br>Azelle shrugged.<br>Nevertheless, they decided to accept her as sane. No later than that, she invited them to follow her eastward. And when Thrust asked her for what reason, she said that it was to storm to Dinotown Prison and free the wrongly imprisoned heroes. Although that was not what they had in mind, they lay their trust in her.<br>Along the way, Fricaya was dumped with a heap-load of questions, like: “How did you meet Fangstriker?”, “How long have you been together?”, “What kind of adventures did you have?”, and etc. But she answered all of those as if Fangstriker was another sirain...and her ‘hubby’. She was not making any sense at all.<br>Thrust, sensing something was out of place, asked her a teaser question: “So how is Fang doing with his studies?”<br>“He’s doing good. He’s learning a new skill: <em>master fisher</em>.”<br>“You know, he actually studies in the University.”<br>“He does? Uh...I mean he does!”<br>“Which cab?” (As in ‘cabin’)<br>“The public one, of course!” (Thinking he meant taxi)<br>O_o<br>Finally, they arrived at the western outskirt of Dinotown, where the prison was located. They hid themselves in a little cave in a small declivity* facing the prison station. The prison was protected by a large perimeter of fences. Of course, for a wanwan it was a simple task to climb them over...had it not been for the barbed wires, anyway. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br>So now they had to work out a solution of breaking in. The solution for the fence was to use Fricaya pressured <em>water canon</em> to slice through the barbed wires. Upon entering, there would be an alarm, so the options were either to fight or steal through. They chose the latter; who knew how many dinoz were defending the prison? But then they returned to the former plan about the fence. Maybe it would be better to just dig through right under the fence and steal into the prison easily.<br>They debated this issue several times without a firm conclusion, but the biggest obstacle was that they did not know anything about the prison itself. Any of their careful considerations could end up in ruin if things did not meet their expectations.<br>Suddenly, the ground began to shake.<br>“Earthquake?” said Azelle.<br>But Amigo knew better, “No...machines!”<br>Sure enough, loud motors sounded from the distance as the ground shook more violently. And then, as if out of the blue, heavily armored jeeps drove over their heads and smashed into the barbed fence! The alarm sounded! Prison guards and dinoz sprang into action to stop them, but their armor and speed was too much for them to handle. In just a moment’s time, the jeeps had crashed into the prison cells of the dinoz section: the national heroes’ dinoz were loose and were now fighting for freedom. Next, the jeeps slammed into the human section of the prison station, releasing the national heroes!<br>The work was down for them — Thrust and his team.<br>“Well, our job’s been done for us. What now, Fricie?” Thrust turned to the sirain, but she simply stood still; clueless.<br>“Wait, where’s Amigos?” wondered Amigo.<br>“I thought he was beside you.”<br>“He was, but not anymore... Gone to pee, maybe?”<br>“In public? ‘Cause there’s no privacy in this kind of situation, you know.”<br>“O he doesn’t mind anything except anything that I do.”<br>“Amigos!” Azelle called, “Come out, come out, wherever you are!”<br>“Amigos! <strong>Amigos!!</strong>” Thrust called, but he was not to be found...<br><br><br>Declivity* - a downward slope, as of ground<br><br><br>I'd also like to note that I'd like to give my regards to Fangstriker for his permission to apply his character, Fracaya, whenever I need, because hereon, I going to need Fricaya for almost all my chapters. Thank you, Fang, and best of luck with that new story of yours! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif">

                Hehe^_^. I already came up with the first two chapters in my head. I'd just need to find a way to get my laziness off enough to write it. It's summer and it's so hot that I'd rather sit in front of the electric fan or AC to keep me cool. Anyway, nice story, the plot is very thrilling.

                @Fangstriker<br>You too, man. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><br>@All my readers<br>And sorry I did not post again yesterday. This time, I had no internet connection. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"> I had to wait until the following morning. But, nevertheless, here's another chapter:<br><br><br>Chapter 22: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_door.gif"> A Zenzen’s Perspective <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_door.gif"><br><br>For me, Zenzen training was not any easier than my mission at Dinoland. It was hard to put my mind in ease and relax, as the pressure of my mission, even though I had resigned, was still squeezing me. Plus, my conscience did not leave me alone for all this time I was at the Zenzen monastery, as if I had done something wrong. Master Hydargol told to let go of everything and to be numb to all emotions by completely relaxing my body and emptying out all thoughts in my mind. Easier said than done. Was he in my shoes, he might’ve understood my position. Maybe he did, but I could not see him expressing his compassion.<br>I watched how the veteran monks meditated at the bottom of Mutant Falls with the water punching down on their shoulders. The water was colder than the ocean, but they could stay motionless for hours! Master Hydargol told me that by learning how to subjugate my body, I would be able to do as the veteran monks did. But I still had a long way to go to that stage, and my stay was only temporary.<br>That evening, as like all evenings, Master Hydargol invited us to sit around the fire as he told us a story. I had already heard many stories from him, all of which captivated my mind! But this time, he told us a story which he had already told us some time ago: <em>Rise of the Dinoz</em>.<br>It was the time when the dinoz’s fighting capabilities had not been discovered. But because of an evil fiend of a person, Honorus Arkon, this discovery was made. Because of that, the power of the dinoz fell in the wrong hands. It took time before the righteous people managed to tame their own dinoz and use them against Honorus. Even though I had heard this story already, it was still a privilege to hear it again. However, it was then confusion struck my mind: according to Hydargol, Honorus lived thousands of years ago, but according to the writing on the coffin in the Katatombs, he died not too long ago.<br>I wanted to interrupt, but I was reluctant at first. But I mustered my courage and said, “Excuse me, Master Hydargol!”<br>All eyes fixed their gazes on me. It was an awkward moment, but I was dying to know the truth.<br>“It’s not that I don’t enjoy your stories,” I continued after a brief pause, “but didn’t Honorus die not too long ago?”<br>“Who told you that?” he said.<br>“Well, I read that on the coffin of Honorus himself at the Katatombs.”<br>“That can’t be. Our records clearly say that Honorus lived many years ago.”<br>“Then how come he was the last king of Dinoland before he died?”<br>“He was king, but not right before your time.”<br>“Huh?”<br>“The inscriptions in the Katatomb may be talking about symbolic events, but we do not trust the Katatombs in terms of their accuracy. And tell me this: if Honorus died not too long ago, how recent are the demons?”<br>“So the demons came after the discovery of the dinoz...of course,” I thought to myself aloud, “demons are dinoz. And the first post war started when I was born.”<br>“Yes.”<br>“But-but...grrrrr...this is so confusing! How can I decide between two concepts that claim each one is correct!”<br>“It is your choice, apprentice. Each one of us is given a choice in life. Beware, one choice is good, the other is evil.”<br>“Master, please get to the point. First you talk about your insight on Honorus, and now this.”<br>“Indeed. You may choose to return, but face a world of agony, torment, pressure, and hopelessness. Or you may choose to stay and let everything go. The problem of Honorus is not important. Reach enlightenment, become a perfected being, and enter Nirvana*.”<br>From that point, I didn’t have the energy to argue any more, but I spent a sleepless night trying to figure out the truth. Several things attacked me from within: this puzzle, the frustration of not being able to achieve a firm conclusion to this puzzle, and, above all, my conscience.<br>Finally, when morning arrived, I made up my mind: I was going back! It had been some confusing days for me. I did not know which path to choose and which was the correct one. I was ignorant and selfish to quit on the mission like this. Though the deadline had long been passed, the mission was still yet to be accomplished.<br>While I was packing my stuff, Master Hydargol came into my room. He looked at my luggage and unpacked stuff. I paused, thinking that he would be surprised and scold me for choosing such a “foolish” decision, but actually I was the one surprised to see no expression of anger on his face. In fact, he even smiled at me!<br>The aged master slowly walked up to me and patted me on the shoulder. He nodded with a smile and then said, “Good work, apprentice — you’ve made the right choice.”<br>I was stupefied! I thought he wanted me to stay and become a Zenzen monk. But apparently, he had something else in mind.<br>“Master, I thought you wanted me to stay. You told me that just yesterday.”<br>“I was testing you to see whether you would choose to save others over receiving personal gratification, and you did”<br>“But I thought the Zenzen ideology is about abandoning all worldly desires.”<br>“It is. But there is one desire that our ideology upholds: it is to give enlightenment to <strong>all</strong> sentient** beings.”<br>“Wow...that is quite an ideology! So...uh...can I continue packing?”<br>“No.”<br>O_o<br>“Just kidding. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"> Oh, and take this with you.”<br>Master Hydargol handed me a little flute.<br>“What is it?”<br>“It’s a scorpscuba caller. Just use it whenever you want to leave this Island. Good luck, friend.”<br>“Shouldn’t that be apprentice?”<br>“Friend!”<br>And so, I summoned a scorpscuba, which arrived and opened its mouth, inviting me to step inside. I did so and waved goodbye to Master Hydargol and the Zenzen monks...<br><br><br>Nirvana* - <u><em>Buddhism</em></u>, a state in which an individual is free from the the cycle of reincarnation and its consistent sufferings; attained by Arhat as his goal, but postponed by the Bodhisattva. (I know I'm liking the Zenzen tradition to Buddhism, but don't you think they look kind of similar? <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink2.gif"> )<br>Sentient** - characterized by sensation and consciousness

                Chapter 23: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"> The MRL Warship <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"><br><br>As the scorpscuba swam, I was meditating away. Now that I had confirmed it to myself that I was on the right path, my conscience stopped bothering me and I could meditate in peace, just like Master Hydargol taught me to. Meditating was almost like taking a nap without falling asleep. And when I go up, I was full of energy. I thought I could get used to this Zenzen meditation thing. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br>I was inside the scropscuba, so I couldn’t see what was going on. But when the scorpscuba made a sudden violent vibration, and then stopped, I knew that we crashed into something.<br>The whale-like creature surfaced and opened its mouth, allowing me to go out. So I got out and dived into the water to see what the obstacle was. It was hard to open my eyes in the freezing, salt water, but I pushed myself... And what I saw down there was a shock to me!<br>Down there was an enormous martial submarine! Its length was immeasurable and missiles were equipped on every side of it!<br>I surfaced back up for some air, and then dived down again to observe more. I soon figured that it was a MRL warship (<strong>M</strong>aritime <strong>R</strong>ocket <strong>L</strong>auncher). Then I wondered to whom it belonged: Dinoland did not own any large submarines like that.<br>I resurfaced and dived again. This time, I observed the missiles. They looked like ordinary missiles to me — I wasn’t so good with things that had to do with the military. So then I spied through the portholes* of the submarine: a messy bunk. Wrong porthole... =S I looked through another one: a dining hall. Another wrong porthole...<br>I resurfaced a third time before diving down again. I looked through another porthole: this time, it was the torpedo room. Two men were there engaged in discussion. Of course, I couldn’t hear a word they were saying. But then I saw one of them fitting an oval-shaped object in one of the missiles. I couldn’t tell what it was at first, because of the blurry view through the porthole, but then I realized...a kabuki egg! The ship belonged to the Conquerors and they were about to launch terror on Dinoland!<br>A timer popped out from a screen in the torpedo room, saying: T-24:00:00. That was 24 hours to launching!<br>I briskly returned to the scorpscuba and ordered it to swim as fast as it could. But it seemed the Conquerors had noticed us — they began firing torpedoes at us! These torpedoes were freeze-rockets: they turned anything into ice at impact! Several torpedoes just barely missed us, creating large blocks of ice in the water. But finally, one torpedo hit the back of the scorpscuba, Luckily, I saw that coming and dismounted the whale as quickly as I could. But the scorpscuba was not so lucky — it struggled to free itself from the heavy ice and descended down into the abyss, never to be seen again...<br>The alarm ceased. They must’ve thought that the scorpscuba was the only intruder. So I swam alone towards Dinoland, but the task was impossible. No land could be seen in the horizon. Soon, I got tired of swimming. All my muscles were exhausted from the swimming, and I was losing heat in my body. I was shivering in the cold water, but I knew I couldn’t stop, or I would surely die.<br><em>Can’t...swim...more...</em> I thought to myself, <em>Need...a...miracle!...</em><br>And it happened! I saw a figure in the distance: a small dot that quickly grew larger as it approached. And, my, was it familiar... “You?”<br>It was the hippoclamp that I had once temporarily tamed (his name was Ricardo, but I didn’t know that; I didn’t even know he was a male <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif">). It gave a grunting noise and tuned its side to me, supposedly inviting me to hop on for a ride. I eagerly accepted the proposal. From there, Ricardo took me back to the Frish Port, and by the time we arrived, it was dark.<br>“Thanks, girl,” I said, but got bit in the heinie. I didn’t know why. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br>Having returned, I started a frantic search for the Yakuzi. Hopefully, he would be at the Frish Port doing his usual business of conning people. And to my relief, I found him doing just the thing.<br>“Hey, lady, wanna play a game of ‘Toss the Coin’,” he said to a young woman, but she slapped him on the cheek and walked away...<br>“That was kind of harsh...”<br>“Hey, Yakuzi!”I shouted.<br>“T? You’re back!...And your soaking...”<br>“I know, but where’s Thrust?” I got straight to the point.<br>“He just went looking for the ship that took the kabuki eggs.”<br>“I found it! It’s just south of here, between Waikiki Island and the Coral Mines! And they’re gonna launch the rockets, with the kabuki eggs, in less than 24 hours!”<br>“No kidding! Great! Now how are we supposed to find Thrust? He must be miles from here!”<br>“Uhh...let’s see...uhh…wait! Thrust’s collar I bought him! It has a built-in walkie-talkie! I can just contact him with my cell phone!”<br>I pulled out my cell phone and dialed the number to Thrust’s walkie-talkie...but my phone was not working!<br>“What the...! Oh, excellent! Why can’t they make these things water-proof! So much for 1,775 sterrals**! Can I use your cell?”<br>“I don’t have one...”<br><em>Oh crud...</em> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cry.gif"><br>“Do you have a car, then?”<br>“I do, but it’s a secondhand car.”<br>“That’ll work. We need to get to the University. They definitely have a phone, and Professor Eugene will know what to do in this crisis. Let’s go!”<br><br><br><br>Porthole* - the circular window of a ship<br>Sterral** - Dinoland currency (not really <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/lol.gif"> )

                Here's another chapter <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif">: <br><br><br>Chapter 24: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_1.gif"> Underground Showdown <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_1.gif"> (Special thanks to Killer60 &amp; Fangstriker)<br><br>They looked everywhere for Amigos, but he was nowhere to be found. Every one of them searched frantically, but only Fricaya seemed to be relaxed about it.<br>“Why aren’t you doing anything?” Thrust asked her heatedly.<br>“’Cause he’s lost. What’s the point of searching,” she answered.<br>The reply frustrated him more.<br>Suddenly, they heard a voice from the distance shouting, “Master! Msater!”<br>“You hear that, guys? Let’s go!” said Thrust, and the team sped to where the voice was coming from. They ran, jumped out of the bushes into front of the source of the voice...and were dumbstruck!<br>“Fricaya?!”<br>“Thrust?”<br>Right in front of Thrust’s eyes was the exact lookalike of Fricaya...or was that the real one?<br>“Have you seen my master?”<br>“What’s his name?”<br>“What do you mean ‘What’s his name’? It’s Fangstriker!”<br>“So you are the real Fric. But wait...if you’re the real Fricaya, then who’s that?”<br>“Doesn’t matter to me,” said Amigo, “’Cause, cuán romántico, Fricaya, I didn’t know you had an alluring twin sis...what the...”<br>“I don’t see any resemblance of me,” said Fricaya, “Thrust, that’s a gluon!”<br>The real culprit behind the disappearance of Amigos revealed itself: the gluon turned back into its original form and then shot fire from its mouth! Everybody dodged it just on time. Then the gluon started escaping!<br>“After it!” Thrust shouted.<br>They ran after the gluon as it caressed past tree and uneven ground like flowing water. They others had a hard time going around the dense forest; even Thrust and Azelle couldn’t <em>accelerate</em> without smashing into a tree. But finally, they traced the gluon to its nest — the same crevice in the small declivity. However, the cavern was extremely dark inside; and since it was nighttime, it did not improve the condition. Fortunately Thrust, Azelle, and Skora were lightning dinoz, so they lit themselves up to shed some light in the ‘nothingness’.<br>What they thought was a nest appeared to be a whole underground system, like a labyrinth! In a short time, and unsurprisingly, they found themselves lost and having no idea of which way the exit was. All they knew they could do walk proceed with caution, as a whole family of gluons could’ve popped up all around them.<br>Suddenly, they heard a battle cry... Abandoning their carefulness, they sped for the loud noise that got louder and louder until it was echoing off the walls of the underground corridors. And when they finally arrived at the sight, they were taken by awe! A great showdown was taking place between a whole colony of gluons and some of Thrust’s friends: Welceon and Leafblaze. Then another surprise hit them: Amigos was fighting alongside them!<br>There were horned smashrooms fighting together with them. One of them was actually the one that <em>contaminated</em> Thrust, but at least he was on their side now.<br>Thrust conducted his team around the battlefield to the rear, where the master of the gluons, a dark and mysterious figure, was seated on his throne. Thrust, seeing his opportunity to attack, use <em>flash wave</em> on the man, but he had realized that he was being ambushed and escaped. Shame, of course, but nevertheless they had friends to save. So they attacked the gluons from behind. Azelle used a combination of <em>focus</em> and a never ending series of <em>lightning dance</em> attacks. Skora <em>flew</em> up in the air and used her exemplary <em>agility</em> skills to confuse the gluons, making them easier targets for the wanwans. As for Thrust, he had his <em>hermetic aura</em> on and attacked with <em>flashwave</em>. Many times, however, he had to defend his friends from the gluons’ powerful attacks, and many times he had to use <em>leafy dawn</em> to heal them. Welceon and his team at the front did not notice Thrust’s squad, as they were too busy fighting.<br>Amigo and Bob fought too...<br>“Hey Bob! (Taking him by the legs to use him as a mallet) Let’s kick some glue!”<br>However, these gluons were no ordinary gluons. It was as if they were invulnerable to any physical damage. No matter how many times they would shoot electricity at them, they would rise again to fight. Eventually, they gained the upper hand, pushing Thrust and his team back fight defensively. This ugly situation was the same on Welceon’s side of the battlefield.<br>But just as all hopes in victory were lost, the familiar rumble of powerful motors vibrated the chamber. And then...BAM!!!...the armored jeeps, filled with fiery softpigs, slammed into the room, frightening the gluons into retreat! It was then that Welceon noticed Thrust. The three korgons ran to each other in brotherly love, but then stopped just before the point of hugging.<br>“So, how’s it goin’?” asked Amigo.<br>“I bit weird...I guess. That Leafblaze guy summoned me, so I came to fight,” replied Amigos.<br>“Oh, so you were not kidnapped?”<br>“No.”<br>Welceon thanked Thrust for and his team for their effort before departing, leaving them in an empty chamber to rest up. Thrust glared at Azelle’s wounds and started healing them with <em>leafy dawn</em>, but before he was done, the walkie-talkie turned on:<br>“Thrust...Thrust! Can you hear me?” I spoke into the phone at the University.<br>“Meow? [Master?]”<br>“Good. I need you and everybody to get to the University immediately. On the double! Move!”<br><br><br>Hope you like it. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br>Enjoy!

                The end is approaching. One of these days is gonna be the end of Thrust 2. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br>Here's another chapter:<br><br><br>Chapter 25: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_2.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_4.gif"> Thrust’s New Self <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_4.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_2.gif"> (Special thanks to Killer60 &amp; James Cameron...I guess <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink2.gif"> )<br><br>After I had said my order, Thrust and the team moved northward to the University. I was so glad to meet Thrust again; so glad, in fact, that I squeezed some of his lightning energy on me when I hugged him (I didn’t mind though <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif">).<br>Soon after that brief moment of hugging and rejoicing, Professor Eugene stepped out of his room and said, “Good, you’re here. T told me everything about the submarine and the kabuki missiles. We’ve only got little over 10 hours before they launch them.”<br>“So what do we do?” I asked.<br>“I have an idea, but I need a sample of a gluon.”<br>“Didn’t you save some of that sample from the last war?”<br>“It’s not good enough. You see, there is not only one species of gluons — there are many, and we classify them according to their strength and capabilities.”<br>“I didn’t study that in any of my lessons.”<br>“Of course not. This is a very complicated issue, and it has not even been fully researched. Anyway, I need a sample of an A-class gluon: the strongest gluon known to man. These gluons are capable of morphing perfectly into anything they wish and can imitate any element they wish. I know it might take a while to find one, but that’s our only hope...”<br>But Thrust stepped forth in front of Eugene. The dinoologist new that the wanwan did that to say something, and he was right: hidden in the fur of Thrust was a piece of the greenish ooze of a gluon. Eugene carefully retrieved it and observed it under his microscope. The result was surprising!<br>“What a coincidence! This goo happens to be a piece of an A-class gluon! How did you know?”<br>Thrust meowed.<br>“Awesome! So now what do we do with it?” I asked.<br>“Well, I’m now going to have to ask you of an unusual request. First I need a DNA sample of Thrust, Fricaya, and Skora.”<br>He plucked a thread of fur from the three dinoz and then continued, “Okay, now what I’m going to do is create a <strong>new body</strong> for Thrust.”<br>“A what?” I said. I did not see that one coming! A new body for Thrust? I didn’t know any word that could express my feelings at that point. I could say I was breathless, speechless, and a bit overrun by shock, but none of those words were enough to exactly describe my feelings.<br>“Of course, I need your permission,” said the professor.<br>“Oh, what? Uh, yea...uh, yea... Let’s do it. Thrust, are you willing?”<br>“Meow.” In other words, ‘Yes!’<br>Professor Eugene stepped into his laboratory and closed the door in front of us, meaning we had to wait until the new body was ready. I couldn’t wait! But at the same time, I was anxious and thought of the worst.<br>Meanwhile, on the other side of the door, the ambitious professor got to work. He placed the DNA samples of the three dinoz and the gluon into a capsule and then filled it with water. After that, he placed the capsule in a closed chamber and the molding of Thrust’s new body began!<br>Streams of electricity shot from the walls of the chamber at the capsule, combining the DNA of the four creatures into one and forming a zygote. The professor carefully manipulated the shape of the newly formed body as it slowly turned into an embryo. Many times, he had to modify the temperature to the exact degree required and at the same time to make sure that the embryo was growing steadily (the whole process of childbirth would normally take several months, but here, it was all happening in one night!). Now the embryo was forming into a fetus. You could now tell which what kind of creature the professor was creating. At this stage, the fetus was ready to receive its elemental powers. Eugene typed away on the supercomputer, fitting in all the skills that the developing dino would perform. Soon after that, the fetus had turned into a baby dino. From there, it grew into an adolescent. And from there, it finally reached the last stage of its development in the capsule: adulthood.<br>Professor Eugene finally stepped out of the door. We all turned our attentions on him as he said the following, “Now I need Thrust. I’m going to perform a transition operation where Thrust’s mind is going to be deliberately taken out of him and put inside his new body.”<br>AMIGO: “Man, isn’t that kind of copying from James Cameron’s <em>Avatar</em>?”<br>JAMES CAMERON (out of nowhere): “Yea, and I’m gonna sue whoever’s writing these <em>Thrust’s Tale</em> series!”<br>T200: O_o<br>Anyway, Eugene took Thrust inside and began the risky transition operation. He placed Thrust and his new body opposite of each other and started operating. The supercomputer pointed a laser beam at each of them and gradually removed Thrust’s mind from his original body. The wanwan was feeling a strange blankness as the process was progressing. One moment passed, and everything was black. Another moment passed, and he could see again! When he woke up, he could still see a body right in front of him, but he soon realized that that was his original body — he was now in his new and modified body!<br>The whole operation of creating the body and the transitioning took 9 hours! Professor Eugene stepped out of the laboratory for the last time and introduced us to Thrust’s new self, “Brace yourselves. I present to you...the first ever of a new species of dinoz...Siwan! That’s sirain and wanwan put together. Sorry I didn’t put glidewings in there...I couldn’t find any room in the name...”<br>Thrust stepped out slowly, still getting used to his new body as he clumsily walked out the door.<br>“Take it steadily now. Don’t rush.”<br>“Uh, Eugene,” I said after taking a careful look at the new body, “<u>I don’t see any difference</u>!”<br>“Ahh, but that’s because he’s in his <u>concealed form</u>. He’ll be in this form most of the time, but when needed, he can <em>mutate</em> into his true form. So just tell him to <em>mutate</em> when you want to see him in reality. And here’s a hint: this wanwan is as happy in the water and in the air as he is on land!”<br>“Awesome! But no time for testing, we have to stop those missiles in the air. We can’t stop that submarine now!”<br>“We need a pteroz,” said Amigo.<br>“Exactly, and I know just whose pteroz to use...”

                Chapter 26: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_4.gif"> Friend and Foe <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_4.gif"><br><br>I gave Thrust Azelle’s collar to sniff. He picked up another scent, and we were now on the trail. Soon, we found the house we were looking for. However, we only had 10 minutes on the clock! Having that in mind, we rammed the door open and got ourselves ready for a fight!...but no one responded; no one was in the room, to be precise.<br>“If he didn’t hear this, that means he’s still asleep,” I concluded, “Jeez! It’s almost 12:00 and he’s still sleeping!”<br>I was talking about Benroy, my x-friend. He had been a close friend of mine until he decide to become a treasonist to save his own butt. I remained a loyalist to save the nation’s butt...oops!<br>Anyway, we ran upstairs and slammed open his bedroom door. This time, the noise woke him up. But before he could fully realize what was going on, we had him under our clutches!<br>“Well, well — we meet again...” I sneered at him.<br>“What’s going on?”<br>“You know perfectly what’s going on...well, maybe you don’t...anyway, we’re not here to please you.”<br>“Yea, I can see that. But what are you doing in my house at this time of day?”<br>“It’s almost noon, dude! You think sleeping 14 hours a day is normal?”<br>“I always sleep 14 hours a day!”<br>“Well then I guess it’s time for you to get up! Now listen: we would like something from you.”<br>“What? The answer is ‘no’ anyway.”<br>“True...but what if I were to tell the world that you — like — Jenny Carpora*?!”<br>“You’re bluffing! You couldn’t do that!”<br>“Oh I am famous enough to be heard!”<br>“You wouldn’t dare!”<br>“Yes I would! I’ve even got hard evidence of you smooching a picture of Jenny in her bikini!” (I pulled out a photo of him doing that; the photo that I took when we were still friends)<br>AMIGO: “This is getting interesting...<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/surprised.gif">”<br>He finally gave in to us. I asked him of his pteroz, A.C.E., and he agreed, but not unless he came with us (because he knew how to correctly fly a pteroz while we didn’t). Amigo looked at his watched and said with an urgent tone: “The missiles have been launched! Hurry now!”<br>I, Thrust, and Benroy mounted on A.C.E. The others stayed behind to keep an eye on things (and also too much load would not get us airborne). Then Benroy gave us flight safety instructions:<br>“The number one and most important rule in pteroz-flying is <strong>keep your body low</strong>! Make sure your stomach and chest are in contact with the pteroz back, or the wind will knock you off as we fly! Number two: always wear goggles (passing us his spare goggles) to protect your eyes from the dust particle in the air!”<br>“Okay, we got the point! Now let’s go!”<br>The pteroz broke into a run to gain enough speed to fly. However, even though there were only two people and one wanwan mounted, A.C.E. was used to carrying only one person—he struggled to gain altitude.<br>“It’s not going to work this way!” Benroy shouted at A.C.E., “Give it more thrust, boy! C’mon! More thrust!”<br>This gave me an idea. I turned to my wanwan...or siwan:<br>“Thrust, would you mind?”<br>Thrust drew out one of his protracting claws and poked A.C.E. on the tail — it worked! The pteroz flew up out of shock and was now airborne! Well, I got kicked back by the wind a bit, because I didn’t take Benroy’s first rule that seriously, but I managed to save myself.<br>After a moment of bracing myself firmly on the pteroz’s back, I slowly opened my eyes to look at the view below...it was perfect! It was just like Amigo had said! I thought, at that moment, that flying would become an addiction to me. You could feel the wind caressing past you, you could see the world from a bird’s-eye view, and you could get some of that stimulating adrenalin rush that felt like a natural; it was at that moment everything felt so perfect!<br>However, we had no time to enjoy these pleasures: the missiles were in sight and were heading our way!<br>“We have to gain more altitude before the first missile passes us,” I said, “Not one missile should make a touchdown!”<br>So we flew up in the air as fast as we could. We had to hold on extra tightly, as A.C.E. was climbing at almost a 90 degree angle. Eventually, we had gained more altitude than the missiles, and the first one was now about to pass us by. And now...for the real show!<br>“Okay, Thrust!

                Chapter 27: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_2.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_4.gif"> The Siwan Revealed <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_4.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_2.gif"><br><br>The transformation took effect immediately: Thrust’s fur turned ocean-blue — he was no longer a yellow wanwan. His eyes grew larger and had an extra protective lens each, making him look like an anime character made real. His claws became sharper than before and he grew <em>diamante fangs</em> out of his regular fangs. Then, his wanwan tail turned into a flipper of a sirain and a pair of glidewing patagia* grew from his front legs to his hind legs. His ears turned into large head fins and the back of his hind legs also grew small fins. Before long, Thrust had become an amphibious creature!<br>Benroy gave a dumbstruck stare at Thrust, but I pretended not to notice. For now, I only paid attention to the first incoming missile.<br>“Thrust! <strong>Sic’ em!!</strong>”<br>Thrust jumped off the pteroz and opened up his patagia, gliding his way to the first missile and landing on it with a loud clank!<br>“Okay,” I said through the walkie-talkie, “Now find the egg inside the missile.”<br>Thrust used his <em>diamante fangs</em> to bite through the armor of the missile. After several bites, he finally found the egg.<br>“Found it?”<br>“Meow!”<br>“Good! Now electrocute the egg! That should fry the kabuki inside.”<br>He obeyed. A quick strike of electricity and one was down. Then Thrust jumped off that missile and flew to the second one and did the same to it. I just hoped the Yakuzi wouldn’t mind. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br>After the second one, the rest were taken care of quickly and smoothly. However, those were only 6 missiles! Where were the others?<br>“T! You there?” Eugene spoke from the ground.<br>“I read’ya!”<br>“Skora here has just spotted three missiles in the river. I guess the Conquerors are shooting them from all directions!”<br>“I was afraid that might happen,” I replied, and then turned to my siwan, “Thrust! More missiles in the river! You think you can jump?”<br>He was positive: without answering, Thrust jumped off and was skydiving 1000 feet (~300 meters) right for the river below. I was worried that the fall might have been too great, but amazingly, Thrust made it and was now swimming after the torpedoes! You could see him <em>accelerating</em> in the water by the huge waves he was creating! And you would be surprised to see that he was actually speeding past the torpedoes.<br>Now he was in the lead. He turned around to face the incoming weapons and triggered <em>absolute zero</em>, completely freezing the river and stopping the torpedoes.<br>“Good work, boy!” I congratulated him before switching the connection with the professor, “Eugene, status report!”<br>“Bad news... I’ve just received word that six eggs have made it and are hatched. We do not know their location!”<br>“Darn it!”<br>“That’s not all, I received a letter from Bao Bob just a minute ago. He’s reporting the Conquerors are about to attack any day now.”<br>“That’s too vague! How much time have we got?”<br>“I’d say about three days until the invasion. So what do we do?”<br>I thought for a moment about that: we could either search for the kabukis before they caused too much damage within, or mobilize an army of Dinoland loyalists and attack the Conquerors before they arrived.<br>“How does Bao Bob know the Conquerors are attacking?”<br>“Ask him. All I know is that he is the biggest truth teller in the Atlanteid Islands.”<br>“Alright. Then tell Azelle, Skora, and Fricaya to find those remaining kabukis. And if they can, they should terminate them. Are the elementals still in the University?”<br>“Yes.”<br>“Summon them too; we’ll need all the help we can get. As for me and Thrust, and maybe the korgons, we’re going to pay Bao Bob a visit.”<br>“Got it. You need help getting there?”<br>“No, I’m fine for now.”<br>Benroy agreed to escort me and Thrust, plus the three korgons, to Bao Bob’s house on the condition that I <strong>swore</strong> never to reveal his interest in his favorite actress. We picked up the korgons and flew towards our next destination...<br><br><br>Patagia* - the wings of a bat or flying squirrel.<br><br>Tell me what you guys think about Thrust's new self? <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br>Enjoy!

                I'm gald you liked it. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"> If only I could draw him so that you guys could see what he looks like.<br><br><br>Chapter 28: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_2.gif"> Bao’s Secret <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_2.gif"> (Special thanks to Killer60)<br><br>The Dark World...<br><br>“Enoch!” said the voice in the cave.<br>“Yes, grandmaster,” replied the black wanwan.<br>“How are the eggs? Have they reached Dinoland safely?<br>“Well, most died because of Thrust. But six of them have made it and are well hidden.”<br>“How long will it take them to grow?”<br>“In nature, a kabuki grows as fast as a human does. But thanks to our chemists, these kabukis will reach maturity thousands of times faster than normal speed. It’ll only take a few hours.”<br>“Ah! Excellent! And I heard that those ignorant dinoz of T are looking for them. They have no idea of our might! I also heard that Eugene fellow predicts the invasion to be in 3 days? He thinks we’re not ready right now?! Tell the army to attack <strong>immediately</strong>! We will show these people how ignorant they really are!”<br>“Yes, grandmaster! I’m on it!”<br><br>At Bao Bob’s house...<br><br>Upon arrival, I told Benroy that he could go, but he said:<br>“No way! I’m not gonna let you show everyone that photo! I’m keeping an eye on you!”<br>Okaaaay...<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/surprised.gif"> At least he’s with us, meaning I could keep <strong>my</strong> eye on him.<br>I knocked on the door of the house (it was more like a large hut). The door opened and our came a large, muscular stature of a Cyclops. He answered with a plain, yet powerful voice: “Yea?”<br>“Hello, are you Mr. Bao Bob?” I asked.<br>“I am he.”<br>“Oh, okay. Can we come in?”<br>“As long as you’re an enemy of the enemy.”<br>At first, I didn’t understand what he was talking about, but then I realized that he was referring to the Conquerors.<br>“Are those korgons here as food?” he continued.<br>“Si,” replied Amigo, “as long as you don’t chew, swallow, or put us in the oven...”<br>We were invited inside and treated hospitably with a comfy couch and some hot seaweed tea. We were also treated with one heck of a meal: clams, scallops, mussels, lujidanee groupers, and lobsters! (Alright! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif">) He especially gave the korgons a lot of food (probably to fatten their already fat bodies <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif">). But not to worry: I was there to ensure their safety.<br>After our lunch, I proceeded to discussing with him the following issue:<br>“So, Bao, I heard you somehow figured out the date of the invasion.”<br>“I didn’t figure the date, I just received a prediction of approximately when it would occur.”<br>“Wait, you received? Does that you mean you didn’t figure it out on your own?”<br>“No. You see, during the last war, I spoke with an oracle. He said that the third war is to happen somewhere around this time.”<br>“Okay, and what about Honorus and his demon army? Do you know anything about them?”<br>“Everything.”<br>“You do?” I asked in surprise, “Can you tell me?”<br>“Why do you need to know?”<br>“It’s because I’m confused.”<br>Bao took a breath when he heard that. My heart was pounding in that moment of pause, and I was wondering whether he would tell me that or not. But after that brief pause, Bao continued, “What do you mean by ‘confused’?”<br>“I’ve come across two opposing ideas about Honorus. One of them said that he was a recent king of Dinoland, and the other says that he lived thousands of years ago. I don’t know which one to believe.”<br>“Well...I don’t know... I can’t trust people with sensitive information that can be easily announced to the public. But...since you are a trustworthy person, I think I should tell you, but your friend must leave the hut first.”<br>Benroy resisted at first, but he finally left with a little hesitation.<br>“So,” continued Bao, “First of all, let me get things straight. Yes, it is true that Honorus was the last ruling king of Dinoland, and it is also true that he lived thousands of years ago. This may sound paradoxical, but let me simplify this for you. You see, whatever is written in the Katatombs is mostly symbol. Whoever wrote the biography of Honorus meant that he lived many years ago, just as the Zenzen monks say.”<br>“Oh, okay. That settles things then...I guess...”<br>“There’s more. Honorus is <u>not</u> a person. He has <strong>never been</strong>.”<br>“What?!”<br>“Yes, he is not. Honorus is a specter that appears in people’s, or dinoz’s, dreams. Usually, when a person dreams about him, Honorus grants them a trio of items called the Darkness Triad. And strangely, all of these people who had this dream, have reported that they had this Darkness Triad in their possession.”<br>“Wait, Darkness Triad...that’s something that Honorus gave Kille, isn’t it?”<br>“Yes, the Darkness Triad is a sort of key that enhances the power of one’s evil self. Once eaten, your evil side overtakes your good side, and, just like Kille d’Arkon, you become a being of pure evil. It is a very dreadful object. That’s all I can tell you. Promise never to tell anyone?”<br>“I promise. And I’ll even pinky swear it with Thrust and his several million volts of lightning, eh Thrust?”<br>“Meow,” the siwan replied, still in his mutated state.<br>All of a sudden, my phone rang.<br>“Hello?”<br>The voice of Professor Eugene sounded, “T, you’ve got to get back here! These kabukis have grown to maturity in less than five hours and they’re raining havoc on everything in their way! The girls tried to stop them, but they were severely injured in the process! You’ve got to come! Quick!”<br>Thrust jumped to his feat when he heard that Azelle was hurt. So we quickly bade Bao Bob a goodbye and flew away on A.C.E.<br><br>As we flew away from his sight, Bao Bob turned to go back into his hut when a strange noise startled him. He ran towards the edge of the cliff, on which his hut rested, and looked down: A spherical and shiny portal had formed at the foot of the cliff. He whispered to himself, as his heart started to pump uncontrollably, “Oh no... Conquerors!”<br><br>To be continued...

                Sorry for not posting yesterday. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br>Here is yesterday's chapter:<br><br><br>Chapter 29: The Totem’s Revolt (1/5): Stopping the Tide<br><br>I received another call while we were flying, and I could tell it was as urgent as Eugene’s call:<br>“Yakuzi!” I answered, “What’s going on?”<br>“I’m back on Totem Island, and it’s crazy here! Something’s gone wrong with the totem, the change of essence is driving the kabukis insane! They’re behaving a lot more aggressively than they did before — they’ve quite literally gone savage! I don’t know what’s going on with this totem, but it looks like it’s getting ready to go on a rampage!”<br>“You mean that totem’s alive?”<br>“It’s not supposed to be, but it looks like it just got a life. I’ll try to hold these kabukis as much as I can, but I won’t be able to stop them. For now, you’ve got to stop the ones that are in Dinoland!”<br>“I’m on it!”<br>I hung up and thought to myself about the following issues: first Igor went to kidnap some Kabuki eggs, then missiles with the eggs were launched, and now this — the totem coming to life like that had something to do with the Conquerors. But what?<br>The harbor of Dinoland was in sight. Thrust jumped off A.C.E. and took off as I communicated with him:<br>“Okay, Thrust. I know you don’t want to leave the girls while they’re injured, but you’ve now got to defend Dinoland. I hear these kabukis are extremely <em>elusive</em>: they can dodge attacks like water. My advice: use elemental attacks.”<br>At that, Thrust <em>accelerated</em> in the air, passing the Frish Port and making it to Dinoland in no time. There, he spotted the first two kabukis. Dino defenders were on the verge to stop them, but their attacks were useless against the potent <em>agility</em> and <em>elusiveness</em> of the strange dinoz. Thrust called upon a rain of <em>cold shpwer</em>, and not just any <em>cold shower</em>, but <strong>acid</strong><em>cold shower</em>. Then he dived down and <em>focused without mercy</em> on one kabuki, using <em>stealth</em> so as not to be noticed. BAM!!! He hit it square on the crown. Out of shock, the kabuki nearly fell to the ground, but caught itself and made a hasty retreat to an alleyway to rub the heavy pain away. Meanwhile, the second kabuki attacked Thrust. It threw a series of <em>vacuum discs</em>, but Thrust evaded them with ease. These two didn’t seem too hard for him, or so he thought. He shot a stream of <em>flash wave</em>, but the kabuki didn’t even bother to evade that — it’s strange fur was completely unaffected by the lightning! So Thrust used <em>water canon</em> instead, but the kabuki dodged it like...and BAM!!!: it countered with a <em>fatal hit</em> into the solar plexus of Thrust! Almost all the air was punched out of his lungs; Thrust opened <em>hermetic aura</em> an tried to take in as much air as he could while groping in the stinging pain. Now the first kabuki recovered and joined its partner in their attempts to break the force field. When Thrust had recovered from his own pain, he tried to take the fighting in the air, but a kabuki <em>jumped</em> and intercepted the siwan. With Thrust in their grasp, the kabukis harassed him <em>without mercy</em>, ramming him against building walls, scraping him with their sharp claws, and etc. All the while, Thrust was <em>perceiving</em> into the two, trying to find a weakness, which, he saw, were the eyes. And so, mustering up the strength he had while being hammered, he sent a fork lightning of <em>flash wave</em> into their eyes, stunning them instantly. And then, without warning, fire blazed from behind the kabuki’s backs — a fiery hand grabbed hold of the two kabukis and engulfed them in its deathly embrace.<br>It was the Fire Elemental, soon joined by the Water Elemental, who saved Thrust.<br>“Thanks for that,” said Thrust.<br>The Fire Elemental nodded.<br>“That’s 2 down and 4 to go. We’d better get the others quick.”<br>They went to the University and found two more kabukis. Only, these were stronger and more <em>elusive</em> than the last pair. The three worked together to take them down, but that proved to be a daunting task. Twice, Thrust was hit with <em>poisoned claws</em> which weakened him severely. Fire was blasted with <em>water canon</em>, instantly paralyzing him. And Water nearly fell into a <em>black hole</em>, but was saved by Thrust when he used <em>water canon</em> to push him out of the way. Thrust tried to heal himself with <em>leafy dawn</em> while in his <em>hermetic aura</em>, but the kabukis combined their powers to perform one devastating <em>fatal hit</em> on Thrust’s shield. However, this was his opportunity: the kabukis were now close enough for him to aim and <em>flash wave</em> their eyes. He zapped hard and mercilessly, and before long, they were down. Thrust was now able to cure himself and the two Elementals.<br>“You guys are alight?” he asked.<br>The two nodded.<br>Suddenly, a cackle echoed off the wall of the University’s great hall. At first, they did not know where it came from, but then they figured it out when a black wanwan stepped out of the shadow.<br>“Nicely done,” he said sarcastically.<br>“Don’t I know you?” said Thrust, taking a step forward himself.<br>“Yea, I was that guard at Dinoplaza whom you tricked. The name’s Enoch, and I just got promoted by Honorus himself.”<br>“Wait, you’ve taken Kille d’Arkon’s place as the demon overlord?”<br>“I’m not a demon, but I am the new head. Now, you’ve only got one kabuki left to face.”<br>“Isn’t there another one?”<br>“Well, I don’t think I should tell you this, but the MRL warship had a little malfunction. Anyway, minus 1 kabuki will still cause devastation to Dinoland. Kabuki,” he turned to a black and yellow kabuki, “Get rid of those two.”<br>Without warning, two <em>black holes</em> opened beside the Elementals and sucked them into their mouths, leaving Thrust alone.<br>“YOU!!!”<br>“Now, now, Thrust, no need to panic: I’ll give you the one you want, see.”<br>“What do you mean?”<br>“Kabuki, show ‘em”<br>The kabuki turned back to the shadow and retrieved something from the corner of the hall. It was Azelle! Her wounds were tremendous and she was unconscious.<br>“She’s on the brink of death, but she can be saved.”<br>“YOU JERKS!!!” <br>Thrust attacked, but the two dinoz evaded it with ease. Then Enoch turned into gas and entered into the kabuki, <em>manipulating</em> it, and said, “In case your interested, the other two are at the Dinotown Hospital untouched. Now, if you don’t mind, I have a nation to devastate!”<br>And he left. Thrust’s eyes glowed in <em>leafy dawn</em> as he tried to heal Azelle’s heavy wounds. But although he managed to close the cuts and ease the bruises...Azelle did not wake up...<br><br><br>I would also like to announce that after <em>Thrust 2</em> is over, I will post a Fools' Special for the upcoming holiday on April 1st. However, I do believe it's going to be late, so don't worry if I don't post it on time, because I will post it. <em>Fools' Special </em>will be given to you guys on this thread piece by piece for the following reasons:<br>1) It's long! (9 A4 pages, size 12 letters, on Microsoft Word! A normal chapter is 1 A4 page long)<br>2) To give you time to read without being pressured<br>3) I'll tell you later what the 3rd reason is

                Chapter 30: The Totem’s Revolt (2/5): Brotherly Rivalry<br><br>I arrived at the scene just a few minutes later and found Thrust in desperation to revive Azelle. As soon as A.C.E. landed, I ran up to the two and fell on my knees in front of the female wanwan. An explosion erupted in the distance: Enoch was causing great desolation while we were in the empty University. I checked Azelle’s pulse, keeping my finger to he neck for a long time as if I was looking for the slightest hint of life...but there was none...<br>“Sorry, Thrust,” I said quietly, with a tear forming in my eye.<br>The siwan growled at that. I could tell that he was as mad as hell on the inside and that he wished to finish the one responsible for Azelle’s death.<br>But then, surprisingly, Benroy dismounted from his pteroz and withdrew a flask of potion, which he dripped a few drops into Azelle’s mouth. We waited a few moments for a sign — for the potion to do something — and then...she was breathing again!<br>“Angel’s Potion, 5th degree,” said Benroy, “the most powerful form of this kind of medicine.”<br>“But Benroy,” I replied in astonishment, “why did you help us?”<br>“Azelle was my dino...once. It’s only proper that give her the due treatment...”<br>I could say not a word — it was as if my friendship with him was being reestablished. No matter, he was still a treasonist!...maybe...or maybe not...more or less... I couldn’t tell from that moment on. After a moment, I mustered up the words to speak again:<br>“Thrust, we’ll take her from here. You’ve got to stop those kabukis. Understand?”<br>Thrust nodded and <em>accelerated</em> away.<br>Enoch was now harassing a small stronghold of Dinoland, using <em>tornado</em> to disassemble the solid structured and scoop up the debris. But then, another <em>tornado</em> met with his own and nullified each other’s energy. This <em>tornado</em> came from Thrust...<br>“HEY!!!” he shouted at Enoch.<br>The possessed kabuki turned around to face its opponent; Enoch, inside the kabuki, stared at Thrust who stared back, and calmly said, “So you’ve decided to meet your fate, eh?”<br>“You’re going down, Enoch. You’re the only kabuki left to fight.”<br>“Oh, please! After me, there will be a whole army of Conqueror demons. And each one of them is more powerful than three kabuki. And by the way, before we start our ‘death match’, let me tell you a little something: I am...your <strong>half-brother!</strong>”<br>At first, Thrust did not care. But as time stretched, he began to wonder whether that was true.<br>“You think I care?!” he retorted.<br>“You might later on. Before your father, Kille, met your mother, he had a little relationship with another wanwan: a black wanwan, to be exact, thus giving birth to me. This female wanwan had a special skill that no other dino possessed, and it helped her lure Kille to her. That skill is called <em>manipulation</em>. With it, she could possess any dino she desired, so she possessed Kille to fall in love with her. So now you see how I inherited this skill and how I am using it right now. In this battle, you can’t kill me, but I can kill you... Boys! Attack!”<br>The four kabukis, the ones Thrust <strong>thought</strong> he defeated, sprang out to attack! Thrust blew a gust of <em>mistral</em> from his mouth to keep them at bay, but he could not do so for long. The kabuki gang pounded on him with dizzying <em>tornadoes</em> and pressurized <em>water canons</em>. Thrust tried to counter with his own pressurized <em>water canon</em> and <em>tornadoes</em> but he was outnumbered. He also tried to zap the kabukis’ eyes with <em>flash wave</em>, but his attacks were becoming more and more predictable, as the kabukis were using <em>perception</em> to learn his fighting style.<br>Thrust could not take the pressure of fighting four at once anymore. The kabukis had punch the energy out of him and he was now suffering bruises and cuts from their sharp, <em>poisoned claws</em>.<br>But then, a strange anger and sense of aggression arose inside of him that gave him energy like never before. It was strange, and yet somewhat familiar... Thrust stood up and growled hideously at the kabukis; they stepped back, uncertain about this sudden change in the siwan’s temper. At first, he did not understand what was happening, but they he realized that it was his hidden power — <em>primal state</em>!...<br>“Get him!” shouted Enoch, “<em><strong>Without mercy</strong></em>!!”<br>The kabukis attacked all at once, but Thrust’s <em>mistral</em> blast was so powerful and sudden, that it hurtled the lot into the air and crashing them all into a sturdy fortress wall! And before any one of them could get up on their feet, Thrust darted and mercilessly bashed the hell out them! He became so fast, in fact, that the kabukis’ <em>elusiveness</em> was not enough to dodge him!<br>Thrust sent another <em>mistral</em> attack at them and smashed them into another wall! Then, he picked them off one by one with a series of <em>tricky hits</em> and <em>double-hits</em> combined. Finally, to finish them off, he summoned <em>blazing twilight</em>: darkness shrouded the sun a group of meteors fell on top of the kabukis, putting an end to them forever!<br>At last, the nightmare of the kabukis I Dinoland was over!...but then a <em>Sher-Kaar beam</em> hit Thrust in the side. Enoch, the only remaining kabuki, was left.<br>“Nice work,” he tauntingly applauded, “You’ve managed to defeat four of the most powerful dinoz known to man. I didn’t think that a <em>mutated</em>, ugly pest like you would be enough to do that.”<br>“Shut the heck up!”<br>And so, the single combat began...<br><br><br>We arrived at the hospital, but what a hassle: it felt like an overloaded hospital of an underdeveloped nation! There were injured dinoz everywhere and the queuing line was as long as an unused spool of thread! However, none of these dinoz were in as terrible a situation as Azelle. So we rushed past the line straight to the doctors. Because of that, the whole room burst out in anger and shouts of “I should be first!” and the like.<br>“Sir, I know you’re busy, but it’s this dino here. She’s almost dying!” I said, but the doctors ignored me.<br>AMIGO: “Man, this sucks. Maybe if we korgons advertised ourselves as a free meal, then we’d get out attention.”<br>BOB: “La Cucaracha!”<br>AMIGO: “Man, that’s not what I meant, so shut up!” Amigo took <u>Amigos</u> by the legs and smacked Bob on the head, the first time Amigos was ever used as a tool.<br>AMIGOS: “Uhm...that was new...” O_o<br>But then, professor Eugene stepped up from the crowd and shouted with a loud voice that silenced the crowded hospital, “Who here knows T?! Well here he is! And in his hands is a dying wanwan named Azelle, the one who gave all of her heart to help T and Thrust stop the Conquerors! How inhumane of you to think of yourselves at a time when we all need each other! And T has been doing just that: giving himself up to help you!”<br>“I am sorry to interrupt you like this,” I added to the crowd, “But if you allow me to revive Azelle this once, I will repay you with my service to Dinoland, because I once surrendered, but now I am starting anew.”<br>The room fell silent, and then the first person stood up and said in a loud voice, “Let him through! We are in need of a hero! T, you are our hero!”<br>“No! We are the heroes!”<br>After those words, the room erupted in cheer! Eugene tried to calm them down as I went into the operation room, but it proved to be harder than expected. Nevertheless, I was relieved that I had made it on time to save Azelle. As for Benroy, he stayed, but he didn’t give much applause. I wasn’t sure what was going to happen between us. But for now, everything was going well...

                Chapter 31: The Totem’s Revolt (3/5): The Critical Point<br><br>During all this chaos, Bao had noticed the Conqueror portal from below the cliff where his house stood. Immediately after that, he jumped onto his canoe and paddled as hard as he could towards the MRL...<br><br><br>Thrust looked dead into the eyes of his predecessor, and he looked back. Both took a ready stance to launch themselves at the other. A moment later...and the duel began!<br>...<br>The duel ended after another moment’s pass <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif">. Enoch, of course, facing Thrust in his <em>primal state</em> did not stand a chance. He fired many <em>Sher-Kaar beams</em> but none of them hit their intended target. Thrust, with the upper hand in speed and force, evaded the beams with ease and mercilessly <em>flash waved</em> the kabuki’s eyes, thus dropping it on the ground...dead...<br>Enoch exited the kabuki’s body in his gaseous state and reformed into his wanwan self.<br>“This ain’t over, bro,” he said calmly, “Though you’ve beaten me, I still have my next line of defense: Senator Arronway!”<br>At that, Enoch turned into gas and evaporated into the air...<br>Thrust sped back towards Dinotown. He found the hospital in which we were in and darted inside. Not to mention, he was met with a round of gasps from the crowd for his <em>mutated</em> body, but that’s besides the point. He was just about to enter the operation room, but I stopped him just as he noticed me.<br>“No Thrust, you shouldn’t interrupt them,” I said quietly.<br>So he sat next to me and shared a seat with the korgons.<br>“So, how’d it go?” asked Amigo.<br>“The kabukis are down, but there is still one more left in the submarine.”<br>“What?!”<br>“Yea, Enoch told me there was a malfunction in the ship.”<br>“We can’t let that egg get here then, or we’re omlette!”<br>“Eggsactly.”<br>“We better roll it before that kabuki cracks Dinoland’s defenses!”<br>“Hold it. We can’t do it without Azelle.”<br>“It’s always Azelle, no? Aren’t you gonna kiss her already or something?”<br>“Be quiet!”<br>But just as their argument was going to get worse, the doctor came out and informed me, “Azelle is doing well. Her breathing is normal and her injuries are minimal. She just needs some rest and good food to regain her energy.”<br>“And what about the other two?”<br>“They’re up and fine. They’re basically ready to go.”<br>Thrust got up from the chair and ran into the operation room. Azelle was strapped to an IV and was asleep on the bed. He was tempted to say something, but he didn’t want to wake her up, but she was already half-awake.<br>“Thrust?” she said faintly with her eyes closed.<br>He didn’t answer, but let her lie there to gain some rest, then returned to us and meowed to me. Amigo translated: “He says that there is still one more egg in the submarine and that we should go after it before they launch it.”<br>“Then we’d better get to it. Let’s go!”<br>But at that moment, Azelle walked out of the operation room. The crowded hall was filled with curious stares as she limped her way. I immediately picked her up and was about to return her to her bed, but she refused by hissing.<br>“Thrust? Is that you?” She looked at him, wondering whether she was talking to the right wanwan. Only, he was no longer a wanwan.<br>“What are you doing here? You should get some rest.”<br>“I ain’t gonna! I’m coming with you!”<br>“None can do, Azelle. You have to be in full caliber* to do this job.”<br>“I don’t care. Besides, if I stay here, I will be taking up space in the hospital. The other dinoz need treatment more than I do now. So as a BrutForce World Championess, I demand that I come with you.”<br>So it was agreed. Although Thrust and the others were reluctant to take her with them in that state, a deal was a deal with Azelle — <strong>period</strong>.<br><br><br>Howbeit, they were unaware that Bao was already on the case. He found the MRL Warship on the surface of the water, refilling its oxygen supply. As soon as he got close, however, it made a quick descent into the ocean’s depth, but that did not stop the hardcore Bao from diving after it. He was, after all, born for the water.<br>He swam downward faster than the descending speed of the submarine. Now the MRL Warship was in his reach. He punched a hole right through the rear of the submarine, and then ripped it open to enter through it! The alarm sounded! Two men rushed to the scene, but only to be met by the might fists of Bao. And after felling the two to the ground, he rammed open the metal door that led to the corridor.<br>The water was rushing inside! Bao was proceeding on! All the while, Thrust, the team, and I were on our way...<br><br><br>Caliber* - in this sense, it doesn't mean the diameter size of a bullet. It's the degree of one's quality or ability.

So we jumped off of A.C.E.: me, all my dinoz and Fricaya, as Thrust created a <em>bubble</em> around us so that we could breathe underwater. Once we were close enough to touch the submarine, Thrust turned us <em>immaterial</em> and we were able to penetrate through the metal walls like ghosts.<br>“Good work, Thrust,” I said, “Now listen: I bet there are gonna be lots of guards in this ship. I need you to create divergence to distract them while we diffuse that last missile. Got it?”<br>Thrust nodded, turned <em>immaterial</em> again, and darted out of the wall. To that, we proceeded to looking for the torpedo room.<br>The problem was that we didn’t know the alarm was already ringing. A few guard dinoz were rushing towards to scene where Bao was, but came across us. They were quickly eliminated by Azelle’s and Skora’s <em>lightning attack</em> combination, but now we had to hurry. All the while, Thrust swam to the front of the MRL and used <em>absolute zero</em> to blur the windshield of the submarine with a thin layer of ice.<br>“What the hell?!” the pilot of the warship shouted, “I have no vision!”<br>The Admiral dashed up to the pilot to see the problem for himself. Realizing that the windshield had indeed been blotted out, he checked the scanner and saw a red dot on the screen.<br>“There’s something out there, sir. And it’s moving fast!” the pilot reported.<br>“Switch cams on!” the Amiral commanded.<br>The cameras of the warship came to life and spotted the siwan swimming around them.<br>“What the heck is that?” said the Admiral.<br>“I don’t know sir, but it looks like trouble.”<br>“Then shoot it!”<br>They launched the missiles at Thrust, but he was too quick for them. The ice torpedoes exploded and formed ice blocks in the water, but none of them could actually hit the <em>agile</em> siwan. Only one of them managed to hit Thrust and capture him in a block of ice, but he simply used <em>immaterial</em> to get out.<br>“Ice torpedoes are useless,” said the Admiral, “Switch to explosives.”<br>The ice torpedoes were replaced with explosive ones. They fired at the siwan who swam faster this time to avoid the sheer power of the explosions. The explosive torpedoes were better than ice, but they still weren’t enough to get Thrust.<br><br><br>We sped all around inside the submarine, looking for the torpedo room. But finally, we found it. The problem was it was well sealed by a thick hatch*. We needed time to crack through it, so I built traps on either side of the corridor we were in, using my rope and some canteens of liquid nitrogen that I found inside the storage rooms in the submarine. Then we got to work: Fricaya used a super charged <em>water canon</em> to slowly cut through the heavy door. A few guards spotted us and came to stop us, but they were clobbered by the booby-traps that I had set. But now my traps were used, and we were cornered by Conqueror dinoz on both sides of the narrow corridor. Fricaya stopped cutting and joined Azelle and Skora in creating a beam of <em>water canon</em> and electricity! ZAP!!! The dinoz were done in no time.<br>“Woo-hoo! Girl power!” Skora howled in joy, “Slumber party tonight!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>“’Girl power.’” mocked Amigo.<br>Fricaya returned to the door, and finally got it open. A Conqueror inside tried to defend himself, but Fricaya’s water canon knocked him down flat on the ground. Unfortunately, we were in the wrong torpedo room...<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif">, so we went back to searching.<br><br><br>Thrust evaded torpedo after torpedo with ease. After several minutes, he found the cameras of the MRL and ripped them all off with his <em>diamante fangs</em>.<br>“Sir, I’m completely blind!”<br>“Then switch to 3D scanner!”<br>3D scanners activated... Thrust, thinking that the submarine was totally blind, prepared to crack open the windshield with <em>focus</em>, but then the MRL sent a galaxy of mines all throughout the area (and nowhere near the submarine, rest assured), blocking Thrust’s path.<br>“Ok, pilot,” said the Admiral, “Take aim...fire!”<br>A torpedo darted right for a mine...hit it...and KABOOM!!! The force of one mine created a chain reaction that detonated all the other mines. Now Thrust was in deep trouble! With deadly explosions erupting from every angle, the siwan had nowhere to escape...<br><br><br>Hatch* - a thick doorway, usualy found inside a ship, spaceship, and etc.

                Final chapter before the conclusion, and it's long! More information about future lores and tales of Thrust after the <em>Fools' Special</em>. For now, take your time and enjoy. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><br><br><br>Chapter 33: The Totem’s Revolt (5/5): Gathering the Legends<br><br>We ran deeper still into the MRL. We passed door after door in search of the torpedo room with the kabuki egg...then we heard a loud thud! It was as if something massive hit the metal wall. We went to check what it was, and to our surprise — the one who was punching through a heavy door was none other than Bao Bob! He too was surprised went he noticed us.<br>“Bao?” I said, “What’re you doing here?”<br>“I was about to ask the same thing,” he answered.<br>At that, another noise echoed off the walls of the corridor, only this one was more disturbing. The next thing I knew, water was rushing in like a tidal wave! Azelle climbed onto my shoulder before the water could reach us, afraid of getting her fur wet, while Skora clung herself to the wall so as to keep her patagia dry (the rest didn’t mind getting wet).<br>“We don’t have much time,” said Bao disturbingly, “Help me ram through this door!”<br>I didn’t know whether it was the door of the room <em>I</em> was looking for, but I still helped: together with him, our combined forces managed to knock the thick metal door to the floor! <br>BAM!!!<br>The Conquerors inside the room jumped in surprise! Bao crunched his knuckles, ready to fight, but then the korgons stopped him:<br>“Wait, senor! (Picking Bob up) We can handle them!”<br>He threw Bob with all his might (BOB: “Weeeeeeeeeee!!!”) like a dodge ball that bounced off Conqueror after Conqueror and knocked them unconscious!<br>BOB: “Dodge ball!”<br>AMIGO: “Korgon power! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"> Can we join your party?”<br>AZELLE, SKORA &amp; FRICAYA: “No!”<br>AMIGO: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br>Surprisingly, to my good fortune, the room we had broken into was the torpedo room we were looking for! And not only was it a torpedo room, but it was a long-ranged missile control room. Awesome! All we had to do was look for the egg...<br><br><br>The MRL started to tilt significantly! The Admiral held on to whatever he could to keep from tripping.<br>“What’s going on?!” he demanded an answer.<br>“We appear to have an intruder near the far end of the MRL. Water is gushing in,” reported the pilot.<br>Without another word, the admiral grabbed a machine gun and rushed to the rear of the submarine. But as he left the main control room, the pilot spotted something on his 3D scanner. What he thought he had destroyed was still there — Thrust! Now the pilot began to panic. He sent more mines at Thrust to destroy the siwan. But this time, Thrust pushed a mine back with a low pressure <em>water canon</em>. KABOOM!!! The mine detonated at contact with the windshield! Water gushed in and drowned the pilot and everybody else in there! This gave Thrust a clear way inside...<br><br><br>Searching for the egg was a complete hell! I couldn’t help but panic as the water rose. The water level had now reached my hip and I couldn’t move comfortably. But then...<br>“I found the egg!” declared Bao.<br>He ripped open the metal covering of the missile, retrieved the egg, and passed it to me.<br>“You go on!” he shouted.<br>“What?!” <br>“I have something to do!”<br>“We already have what we need! Let’s get out before the sub sinks!”<br>“No!”<br>I didn’t know what he was up to — he was typing away on the computer that conducted the far-ranged missiles — but I couldn’t see for what reason. I kept trying to persuade him, but he wouldn’t move.<br>Suddenly, I heard a loud noise, like something from a gunshot. We ducked down and turned around. And sure enough, it was a gun — a machine gun! As soon as we saw the weapon, we dived into the rising water as the admiral fired at us. Azelle tried <em>flash wave</em> on the admiral, but she was still not completely well, and her attack did not have the strength to take him down (he raised him arm to block it). I took a grenade and was about the pull the trigger, but the admiral shot it out of my hand; I dodged the stream of bullets right after that. Fricaya attempted to stun his with a <em>tricky hit</em> but he knocked her unconscious with a mighty fist. <br>Thus far, he hadn’t hit anybody. But when Bao tried to attack, a bullet thrust into his right shoulder. At that, the admiral needed only one more shot to kill the Cyclops off, but then he realized that he had to reload. I took the opportunity and threw a metal tube at him. He deflected it, but then turned his machine gun at me. I quickly hid myself behind a corner as he started firing again. Azelle and Skora couldn’t fight: they were all wet, and so couldn’t discharge any lightning. My last line of defense was:<br>“Remember senor,” whispered Amigo in an Obiwan-like fashion, “Use the Bob. He’s more elastic than rubber!...”<br>I looked at the little korgon with a little sense of guilt and picked him up. He smiled back at me. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>“God, forgive me,” I said and drew the crucifix on myself.<br>The admiral was slowly approaching the corner behind which I hid. I prepared myself to face this monster-man and turned the corner. He directed his gun — I raised Bob; then he fired, indenting to shoot my, but the bullets hit Bob instead and bounced back at the machine gun, destroying it! (After that the two of us took a moment of O_o and ...)<br>BOB: “Bullets! Yay!!”<br>The admiral dropped the gun in rage and drew his knife. I dropped Bob and drew my own knife, thus commencing a one-on-one knife duel. He charged at me, but I dodged his attack. Then I splashed water into his eyes so that I could thrust my knife into him, but instead of being distracted, he slashed at me, scoring a cut into my arm. He attacked again, but I blocked (and barely allowed him to score another). I tried to counterattack, but he struck again before I could. Now he was slashing his blade at me with almost unmatchable aggression, as I dodged swing after swing. He attacked again: this time I blocked; I had to muster all the strength I had to block this attack, but I couldn’t hold much longer. The admiral pushed me down with our meeting knives. However, I finally found the opportunity to strike back. So I attacked him with the aggression that he had. I didn’t stop attacking: every swing succeeded another. The admiral kept blocking my attacks rather than dodge them like I did, since he was much stronger than me.<br>Unfortunately, I soon grew tired. And when he found <em>his</em> opportunity to strike me again, he landed a bone crushing punch to my chest. The pain was so sudden and sharp that it disarmed me! And even though the pain was not strong enough to take me down, by the time I realized that, I was defenseless. The admiral, not wasting a moment, raised his knife high in the air and... ZAP!!!<br>I was expecting my doom to come any second, but I was wrong. The unconscious body of the Admiral stood there for a moment before falling into the water. Who else could it be that saved my life? Thrust!<br>“Good work, boy! You’re a real lifesaver!” I congratulated him.<br>I noticed Bao get back to what he was doing, despite his injured shoulder. It was then I realized that he was aiming a missile to some place, but where? I further figured that he was launching a nuclear weapon!<br>“A nuke? Bao, what’re you thinking?!”<br>But he didn’t answer and set the location of the missile’s target — his house!<br>“Are you outta you’re mind?!?! That’s your house, for Pete’s sake!”<br>“I can always build another one,” he said and hit the launch button, “Now let’s get out of here!”<br>We grabbed the egg and Fricaya (who was still unconscious) and made our way out. Thrust created another <em>bubble</em> for us to escape to the surface. As we ascended to the light above, we watched sub sink to the darkness bellow, never to be seen again... And when we made it to the surface, we were surprised and pleased to see Ricardo there waiting to ferry us. We gladly mounted onto his back and sailed away...<br><br><br>One by one, the army of the Conquerors came out of the portal. It took several hours for the whole army to transfer from their Dark World into our world. But finally, the whole army made it. The head general took a deep breath of satisfaction as he smirked at the lush terrain of Dinoland in the distance, and said, “Ah, so we’re finally here. The 3rd war shall now commence.”<br>Suddenly, a soldier interrupted, “Wait, what’s that?!”<br>The nuke fell dead in the center of the army. The explosion was chaotically immense! Dinoz, men, and pieces of earth flew in all directions as a large mushroom-like shape of debris formed! Before the Conquerors knew it, their whole army was dead!<br>However, a few survived! (Survived an atomic explosion? <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/huh.gif"> ) Not to mention, that was impossible, but it happened: a demon wanwan, rocky, and glidewing combined their energies to create a shield of <em>hermetic aura</em> and <em>benediction</em> to save a few other demons and the head general himself. All that remained from the cataclysmic devastation were 14 demons — one demon for each dino specie — and the general. The general looked around, stunned by what had just happened. He gave a roaring outburst to express his hatred before turning to his demons and growled, “This will not stop us! If we cannot take Dinoland by military force, then we will take it by influence. Enoch will guide us on this new quest, and may Honorus Arkon be with us. Move out!”<br><br><br>We could see the explosion from the far distance, a marvelous and yet cheerless sight.<br>“What was that for?” I asked Bao.<br>“The Conquerors opened a portal there, so I had to stop them somehow.”<br>“Oh, I see now. So that should get rid of their whole army.”<br>“I hope.”<br>“Well, that doesn’t mean we’re finished. We’ve still got things to get out of the way and we still need to figure out the treachery of the kabuki totem.”<br>“Si, but not only that,” said Amigo, “We’re legal outlaws, remember?”<br>“Yea, and that. And I bet Honorus is plotting a new conquest plan as we talk. So we’ve got several problems to take care of.”<br>“So what are you going to do now?” asked Bao.<br>“Well, now that the police are after us, we can’t return to Dinoland. Do you think there is a secret place somewhere where we could hide?”<br>“Yes, actually. I know the perfect place.”<br>At that Thrust <em>mutated</em> back to his wanwan state as we rode away with the tide in the setting sun...

                And so, here it is: the end... It's been quite a time. But, like everything else, it all has to come to a finish...so sad, yet so true... <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br>Please enjoy our final chapter...<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>Bao led us to an underwater chamber south of the Zenzen temple. He called it the Underwater Dome, and it was more than just a chamber, but a large system of interconnecting domes with a large mother-dome in the center of this huge web. The Underwater Dome was originally built as a battle colosseum where Dinoz master would come and show off the prowess of their dinoz, but it was so unpopular that it closed down and was forgotten (unpopular mainly because of the inconvenience of travelling by scorpscuba). To us, though, it was perfect: plenty of room, hidden underwater, and also a nice old man who was addressed as the Archsage. So we agreed to stay and make our new home here (Bao including).<br>A few days later, to our surprise, Benroy and his pteroz came along. When he explained that he came to the Underwater Dome to seek refuge, since the police was after him as well, we welcomed him in as long as his ties to the Conquerors were cut. He told us not to worry about that, since the Conquerors would also be after him for his helping us in our quest.<br>Guess what happened next... As the days went by, more people came along — national heroes, who were enlisted in the Police Academy’s wanted list. I don’t know how they figured that we were here, but we welcomed them in warmly. One of them was Fangstriker! Oh how Fricaya and he missed each other. It was a warming scene to see the two together again! I asked Fangstriker how he was doing in his adventure, but he said he had quit the memoirs. But hey, no adventure is over while there are things to be done. At that, I offered him to hop on board and continue his adventures with us. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>Weeks later, more heroes came! And by the time several months had passed, we had enough people to establish our own organization. We called it the Heroes’ Anti-Conqueror Academy, or HACA for short. Benroy was in it as well, which was a pleasant surprise for most of us.<br>We had a small election of who would be the leader of the group and the result was that I and Fang would be the co-leaders.<br>Our name was soon heard by the world. Garland described us as an ‘illegal organization that must be stopped for the good of mankind’. True, we were an unofficial organization, but we here <strong>for</strong> mankind, and not against it. Some, like Garland, opposed us, but others glorified us. Nevertheless, any enemy of the Conquerors is a friend of ours! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"><br>As for other matters: the egg hatched, and a cute little kabuki emerged. This one was not dosed with chemicals like the other kabukis, so its growth rate was regular. We did not know what to do with him, so we gave him to Master Hydargol. And even though the Zenzens practice abstinence from possessing dinoz, Hydargol accepted him: not as a dino master, but as a religious master, and taught him the ways of a Zenzen monk.<br>And what about Thrust’s old body? Well...I’ll tell you that later. Thrust liked his new body more. To us as well, even if he were to turn into a gluon, he would still be Thrust, so we accepted his decision.<br>And as for the days to come, we’ll have to see what happens. But we knew one thing: if the Conquerors were up to something, we would be there to counter it. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"><br><br><br>Some time later...<br><br>Welceon dived down and reached the front entrance of the Dome. He passed through one door that led to a small chamber where the water subsided to prevent any water from gushing inside the dome. Then the second door opened that led to the inside of the dome.<br>“Who goes there?” said the sentinel in a blue vest.<br>“Welceon. I’ve comet o bring a message.”<br>“Welceon? It’s you?”<br>“You know me?”<br>Thrust revealed himself. The two gave each other a brotherly embrace and started talking:<br>“Nice vest!” said Welceon<br>“Thanks. We’re all wearing these vests to show that we’re an HACA member.”<br>“Reminds me of the Conquerors with their red vests and burning globe emblem, except yours is blue and with a green globe.”<br>“Yea. That’s to tell everybody that we’re the complete opposite. So, what brings you here?”<br>“I have a message about the demons.”<br>“What about ‘em?”<br>“I know how they’re created.”<br>“You do? How?”<br>Welceon gave Thrust the parchment with the information. The wanwan looked it through and asked someone to translate for him (since he couldn’t read human language). After hearing the translation, he was overcome by awe!<br>“We must send this to T and Fang immediately,” declared Thrust, “And pass this info to every HACA member. We finally know the weakness of the demons!”<br><br>THE END<br><br><br>April Fools' in advance! It's not the end! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br>There are still more lores and stories of Thrust and his buddies yet to come. Tomorrow, I will release the Fools' Special to help you guys &amp; gals celebrate the much loved April 1st holiday. However, as I've mentioned, I'm going to post it piece by piece per day so as to give you time to read it without being pressured.<br>More info on future Thrust's Tale stories after the Fools' Special.<br><br>@Killer60<br>Sorry for not asking permission to borrow your character. I had already written this chapter long ago, but I forgot to ask your permission. Sorry if this has offended you in any way.

                Happy April Fools' and a Happy Easter, everybody! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br>Now that April 1st has arrived I will start posting the Fools' Special. I would also like to hear your comments about Thrust 2 that has just ended, and give me some suggestions if you have any. Thank you, and enjoy. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br><br>----------------------------------------<u><strong><em>Fool’s Special</em></strong></u>----------------------------------------<br>Thrust crawled through the thick weeds and marshland plants, as if on a hunt for a prized dinner.<br>Fricaya sneaked underwater, as if she too was hunting for the same prized catch.<br>Both approached, both stalked, and in the following moment, they both jumped out into the plains! However, there was no prized catch…only the two looking confused into each other’s eyes.<br>Then…KABOOM!!!<br>Thrust switched on <em>hermetic aura</em> and Fricaya created a <em>bubble</em> around her just on time, saving themselves from the deathly blow of <em>blazing twilight</em>! When the sky cleared and the scene brightened, they were surprised to see that the cause of the attack was none other than…<br>THRUST: “Azelle?! What the heck’re you doing?!”<br>But she didn’t answer, firing <em>flash wave</em> at him, which he blocked by <em>conducting</em> the energy into the ground. He tried to counterattack, but it was no use.<br>FRICAYA: “She’s too powerful! We need to team up!”<br>THRUST: “Let’s surround her!”<br>That they did. They attacked simultaneously, but her <em>lightning dance</em> skills combined with her unexpected <em>poisoned claws</em> beat them to the ground. Immediately after that, she finished Fricaya off with a potent <em>lightning</em> bolt from the sky.<br>Thrust, seeing this carnage, was filled with rage. He got up from the ground, <em>mutated</em> and got into primal state and charged at charged at Azelle in full furry! It was an epic battle. Even though Thrust was in an extremely powerful state, Azelle always found an open spot to attack Thrust. But finally, he had her under his claws. The brutalized female lie on the ground wounded, as Thrust stood over her, about to deliver the final blow!<br>THRUST: “It’s over Azelle. Your time has come!”<br>AZELLE: “Uh, Thrust, you only have 1 hp left.”<br>THRUST: “Huh?”<br>AZELLE: “Plus you’re poisoned.”<br>THRUST: O_o … -1 hp … X_X<br>PLAYSTATION: “Player 3, you win!”<br>AZELLE: “Owned.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif">

                Well, guys, by the looks of it, quite a few of us are gonna have our accounts reset. I know it's gonna be a huge bummer, especially for those who've worked hard to raise their dinoz. But I would like to say don't be dressed if it happens to be your account. Just take a few deep breaths, sponge it away, and be happy. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/arrow.gif"> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                Okay, so apparently I was fooled -_-. It seemed that I had forgotten that it was April 1st, so my bad... Nice prank though. You've got to admit it: that was kinda funny. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>Anyway, back to Thrust's Fools' Special.<br><br><br>THRUST: “Why do you keep owning us at Mortal Combat?”<br>AZELLE: “What can I say? I’m homebred  —  I know pretty much everything about the human world.”<br>THRUST: “Well, what about me? I’m not homebred like you. I was born in a dumpster! I don’t know how to appreciate the luxuries like you do!”<br>AZELLE: “Aww, that’s okay, Thrust (patting him on the head). Games aren’t that important anyway.”<br>THRUST: “You’re right. I’ve got more important things to do.”<br>FRICAYA: “Like sleeping on the sofa?”<br>THRUST: -_- … “No, I’ve got a world record to break in sleeping hours!”<br>FRICAYA: *groan*<br>AZELLE: “Come on! Be more productive! Do something like, you know.”<br>THRUST: “Like what?”<br>AZELLE: “Aren’t you forgetting something?”<br>THRUST: “No.”<br>AZELLE (starting to whine): “Can’t you remember?”<br>THRUST: “Nope.”<br>Disappointed, Azelle left with her head down. Fricaya decided to follow her, leaving Thrust alone to think about what he had done.

                Thanks, Lolwhut, much appreciated. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>I'll have my revenge someday...somehow... <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink2.gif"> hehe<br>Ok, from this time on, I'm going to be writing this in third person. So that means I'm going to refer to everyone (and myself) as he/she.<br>Enjoy the next bit:<br><br><br>Meanwhile, T was holding a meeting with the leaders of the HACA. Everybody was present, except for Fangstriker, God knows why. Before T sat down, he checked his chair for any defect that might’ve been inflicted on that one chair. And after wasting 3 minutes on dumb trivia, he finally sat down.<br>T200: “Okay, guys. I think you all know why I have gathered you here today.”<br>PERSON 1: “To talk about improving our food supply?”<br>T200: “Good guess, but now I’d like to hear an answer form someone who’s not a complete foodoholic.”<br>PERSON 1: -_-<br>PERSON 2: “Is it April 1st?”<br>T200: “Correct, and so I would like to notify to all of you to please keep your dirty jokes clean and enjoyable. Don’t play jokes on people that’ll make ‘em want to quit this organization or offend them in any bad manner. That is all. Thank you.”<br>And he left the meeting room. On his way out, he met Fangstriker.<br>FANG: “Hey, T!”<br>T200: “Where were you? The meeting is over!”<br>FANG: “Sorry, T. I just had to run some errands. Quite important.”<br>T200: “Well, that’s ok. The meeting wasn’t important anyway. What’ya got there?”<br>FANG: “This? Oh, it’s for you.”<br>T200: “For me?”<br>FANG: “Yea. Consider it a token of our friendship.”<br>T200: “Thanks, man! What is it?”<br>FANG: “It’s a Dinopedia just like mine! With it you can talk directly with Thrust or any other dino you want.”<br>T200: “Really?! Oh, that’s sweet! I’ve always wanted to know what Thrust keeps talking about. I owe you one, man!”<br>FANG: “No need to return the favor *hehe*. Just enjoy the gift.”<br>T200: “I sure will.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif">

How could you say such a thing?!”<br>THRUST: “What? What did I say?”<br>TRANSLATOR: “<em>What? Want me to kick your fur balls instead?!</em>”<br>T200: “Thrust!!!

You see those two love-doves? Well buckle up. This is gonna be good…”<br>WOMAN: “Honey, you better get your lazy bum here right now and pay for all this!!”<br>MAN: “Yes…honey… But, honey…”<br>WOMAN: “Don’t ‘Oh, honey’ me!! If I say somethin’ you say ‘bark’!! Now get over here and get your wallet out!!”<br>MAN: “But honey, we’ve been shopping all over the place, and I haven’t any money left…” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br>WOMAN: “What?! How do you expect to invite me to dinner then, huh?! Money doesn’t grow on trees, you know!”<br>MAN (finally snapping): “That’s it, woman! I cannot stand your nagging and bossing me around anymore!! You know what? This is over between you and me! Have fun on your own!” (And leaves)<br>WOMAN: “What?! How dare you ditch me like this! I am a woman of class! This is unacceptable!!”<br>(Korgons laugh)<br>AMIGO: “Haha! How was the show, boys?”<br>AMIGOS: “Hehe, ‘I say somethin’, you say “bark’!

Wassssssuuuuuuuppppp!”<br>THRUST: “Yea, what’s up… Anyway, I’m here because of Azelle.”<br>AMIGO: “What about?”<br>THRUST: “I don’t know. She keeps telling me that I’m forgetting something.”<br>AMIGO: “You mean like it’s her birthday today, no?”<br>THRUST: “What?! Today — April 1st — is her birthday?!”<br>AMIGO: “Well, yea. Everybody in the HACA knows that.”<br>THRUST: “That’s everybody except me! God, I’m such an idiot! I, her closest friend, do not even know her birthday while everybody else does. I don’t even have a present ready!”<br>AMIGO: “No worries, man. I know just the place where you can get the perfect present.”<br>THRUST: “Okay, so where would that be?”<br>AMIGO: “Somewhere I call home.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br>THRUST: “Amigo, have you ever noticed that whatever you call ‘home’ is a mousetrap to everybody else.”<br>AMIGO: “I guess that’s why they call it an adventure.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>THRUST: “Wut?!” O_O<br>AMIGOS: “Like you have a choice, no? I may not be in much agreement with Amigo, but he’s right.”<br>THRUST: “You said it. I guess I really don’t have a choice. In return, though. I want you to do a favor for me.”<br>AMIGOS: “That can’t be good…”<br>THRUST: “Amigos, if Azelle asks where I am, think up of something. And Bob, just be yourself.”<br>BOB: “I’m myself!” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br>THRUST: “Amigo, lead the way.”<br>AMIGO: “Sure.

                You want violence? Well, sorry to say this, but that was just a joke.

We now have to cross the largest watercourse in all of the world — the Jumin River. Its current is said to be so strong, that it could take on a match with a hurricane! The bacteria in the water are deadly — any creature can die just by drinking a pint of that water. The fish living here are of the highest caliber, and if you try to eat them, you will die. This, indeed, is the bully-river of the entire world!”<br>THRUST: “You lie.”<br>AMIGO: “Well, okay, April Fools’. The current is not that strong, but everything else I said was right.”<br>THRUST: “Then this river is no problem for me! (<em>Mutates</em>) I’ll see you on the other side.” (Jumps in the river)<br>AMIGO: “Okay, man. Just watch out for the pirhanoz.”<br>THRUST: O_O<br>(Pirhanoz attack)<br>AMIGO (to himself): “Why couldn’t he just cross the bridge?”<br>He walked 10 meters upstream and crossed the bridge.

                Glad you like it. I hope I can come up with more jokes for future episodes.<br><br><br>Azelle was now coming into the party room. Fangstriker switched the light off while everybody waited to throw the surprise.<br>Azelle walked into the room, looked around in the darkness…and then the lights sprang back to life! The whole room burst in song and congratulated Azelle on her *classified*th birthday!<br>“Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday dear Azelle, Happy Birthday to you!”<br>At spotting Amigo, Azelle realized that Thrust was there too.<br>AZELLE: “Thrust! You didn’t forget!”<br>THRUST: “How could I forget? I didn’t even know!”<br>AZELLE: “What?!”<br>THRUST (lying): “Uhh…I mean…April Fools’! Gotcha, didn’t I?”<br>AZELLE: “Yea, you did. You should work on your pranks more, though.”<br>THRUST: “I got you a present.”<br>AZELLE: “Oh, thanks, Thrust!”<br>Thrust handed the gift.<br>AZELLE: … “Isn’t it an urchin?”<br>THRUST: “It’s just the wrapping paper.”<br>Azelle started unwrapping the gift as the whole room fell silent. With the first tear, a bright light shined from the inside. And when the gift was completely unwrapped, it was shining so amazingly that you could go blind if you stared right at it. The light grew brighter, and brighter, and brighter, and…Pop! The light subsided and a hologram* small fish appeared.<br>FISH: “HEY!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, AZELLE!!! Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday! Oh, wait a second! April Fools’, sucka!! Hahaha!!”<br>AZELLE: “Uh…am I supposed to laugh?”<br>Thrust shrugged.<br>FISH: “Oh, no need to laugh! Toothpick, pick tooth! Toothpick’s the name! Why did the chicken make 3 U-turns? ‘Cause the chicken was actually Triple-U! Haha!! You suck, Triple-U!!”<br>WHITE VELD: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br>FISH: “Thrust, you must be such an idiot to get her ME!!!”<br>EVERYBODY: O_o<br>FISH: “Hahaha! Oh, I love this party! You know, it reminds of Jumin River back at Grumhel. There’s a bunch a pirhanoz and korgons, all bloodthirsty. Ahem! I’m the one who’s frickin’ bloodthirsty! Now, which pirhanoz should I choose from the menu? Pirhanoz A, B, C, D E F G H I J KLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ?!?!?! Hahaha! And which korgon for dessert? A? B? C? D? E, F, asdjfhsdfsonfuh!!!! 26 times 26 equals 416 varieties!! Haha!! That’s one number for every letter in the English alphabet! Oh, and hey! The korgons are Español! Olé!! Haha!! Delicacies from all over the world! Haha!! And…oh crud! My time of existence is running out! Well, goodbye! And April Fools’, suckas!”<br>Pop! The fish vanished as suddenly as it appeared.<br>THRUST: “What was that?”<br>AMIGO: “A candiru.”

I’m outraged!” (Throws pillow aside and jumps off the sofa)<br>AMIGO: “How can you be? It was April Fools’, the day you make fun of people.”<br>THRUST: “Firstly, I didn’t like your jokes. Secondly, you got me into a lot of trouble. And thirdly, I ruined Azelle’s birthday party because of you!”<br>AMIGO: “Yea, but you got to admit it — that was definitely worth it.” <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/lol.gif"><br>THRUST: “You didn’t come to the rescue when the avengers attacked, you didn’t bother to warn me about the pirhanoz, you peed in my mouth, took me on to a pointless adventure and almost got me killed, and you set a hologram of a bloodsucking fish that sucks from I-don’t-want-to-say-from-where! Plus you named it toothpick!!!”<br>AMIGO: “Well, at least I don’t sleep 24/7 like you!”<br>THRUST: “And I don’t say ‘si’ every time I want to say ‘yes’!”<br>AMIGO: “Racist!”<br>THRUST: “Neutered!”<br>AMIGO: “Yellow!”<br>THRUST: “Poo-brown!” <br>AMIGO: “Exasperatingly nauseating, repulsively malodorous, prohibitively uncomely, and melancholy-blue frickin’ siwan!”<br>THRUST: “Why don’t you just go —”<br>LOLWHUT: “<strong>GUYS!!!</strong>”<br>AMIGO: “Whoa, where did you come from, senora?”<br>LOLWHUT: “I’m Mod Lolwhut, Queen of the Chaos Tavern.

                Alright, guys. Now that that's over, I'd like to make an announcement. The next sequel to Thrust's Tale will be a series, not a novel-type storyline, meaning each "episode" (as they will be called) will be a plot of its own. Now, I don't mean to say that the main  plot of Thrust's Tale is becoming obsolete. The focal plot is still going to be there, it's just that I'm so busy these days that I can't go on writing more "epic" novels on Thrust.<br><br>   The series is going to be called <em>The Under-Dome Series</em> and it's going to be a comedy based genre. Each episode is going to be longer than the chapters of Thrust 1 &amp; 2, but I will post them by bits, as I did with the Fools' Special. It's going to have more characters in it: Dino as well as real life people (whom I may include from time to time). I may also modify a few personalities of certain characters to make them more comical and spice up the series. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><br>You can consider the Fools' Special as the 0th episode to The Under-Dome Series, but as for now I have to get ready for my exams. Hence, the release date of The U-D Series will be some time this summer. During this time, I will introduce to you some of the new characters so that you may get to know what they are like before the series start, and I'll maybe even post a few drawings of Thrust and the gang. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><br>If you have any questions, or would like to give some suggestions, feel free to post your thoughts here or send them to me via PM. I hope you have all enjoyed Thrust's Tale so far. Stay tuned for The Under-Dome Series. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br><br><cite>Brought to you by T 'n T Productions</cite>

                I'm going to open a new thread for the Under-Dome Series, so this one can be closed.

                Ok, I think it's time I introduced some of the new characters you will find in the Under-Dome Series. The first one you've already seen in the Fools' Special episode. Take a look and enjoy. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><br><strong>White Veld (aka: Triple-U)</strong>: Triple-U is a white gorilloz with a shy personality. Because of his poor social skills, he cannot summon <em>korgon reinforcements</em>. Despite his fault, he excels at wood skills, which is why he is part of the E5 Crew*.<br>Triple-U may be shy and unsocial, but he feels comfortable around his friends and is not afraid to express his mind when he’s around them. Around everybody else, however, he’s like a tame lamb. It is only during fights that he expressed his full fury hidden deep within him.<br><br>The <strong>E5 Crew*</strong> is a small elite team of five dinoz within the HACA. Each dino is a master of an element unique to the others, thus making the E5 a prototype group of elemental diversity. (That's all I can give away to you for now.)<br><br><br><br>More characters coming soon. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                Next character uncovered:<br><br><strong>Nero</strong>: Nero is a sirain who is possessed by the ghost of a well-known Roman emperor (thus the name Nero). He is often portrayed as a bossy figure who demands things to be his way. Of course, he is not used to the public life, since he supposedly came from a royal bloodline of emperors, and thus often gets cranky and upset about his humble reincarnated life as a sirain (not to mention he has no arms). He also believes that he is the rightful leader of the E5, but tends to micromanage things whenever he does get in charge.<br>Another one of his traits is his archaic language. That adds to his annoying personality and is one of the several reasons why he has no friends (apart from the E5…sort of). His way of speech changes, however, over time, but that doesn’t make him any more less annoying. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br>Despite his faults, he excels in water skills, and is therefore a member of the E5 Crew.

                <strong>Charge</strong>: as a stalwart softpig, Charge’s character does not match his external attributes. He has a funny accent and often impersonates Kanye West. But he’s a fun dino to be around. He also possesses awesome fire skills to, which is why (yes, you guessed it) he is part of the E5 Crew.<br>Of the five dinoz in the E5, Charge is the most talkative, often telling little jokes or stories to lighten everybody’s spirits. The only time when he gets annoying is when he impersonates Kanye West. Nevertheless, Charge never looks upon anybody as his enemy, except for the Conquerors…and maybe Toothpick the candiru…

                <strong>Zendude</strong>: Zendude is the kabuki T and Thrust saved from the Conquerors and who was donated to the Zenzen monks. There, he was educated by the Zenzens of their ways. Unfortunately, he took their teaching — about letting oneself go from all the world’s worries — the wrong way. Now he’s a “cool” type of character who takes any kind of situation lightly, often blurting short phrases, like “Yo,” or “Wassup?” etc, and nothing longer than that. His original name, given to him by the monks, is Zenmon, but he changed it to Zendude to fit his personality.<br>Zendude rarely engages in a fight. When in the midst of a fighting, he simply uses his elusive agility to dodge the attacks and does not bother to retaliate. But when he <em>does</em> actually fight, his air skills are deadly. And that is how he came to occupy a place in the E5 Crew.

                Ok, so I will now post the final major/minor characters that you will find in the Under-Dome Series. Enjoy and stay tuned for the Series. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br><br><br><strong>Colonel McColonel</strong>: once a colonel for the Dinoland military, John McColonel was framed by the chief police, Garland. Now he is the head of the military department of the HACA. McColonel is the proud owner of Armstrong the gorilloz, and is a rigid character who takes orders from no one except from those above him in rank. He is a very tactful commander; inborn leader skills combined with his many years of martial experience make him a revered military veteran. He’s never failed in a mission and always shows promising results. His only downfall is that he is too stubborn to listen to anything, including rational complaints and credible suggestions.<br><br><strong>Armstrong</strong>: Armstrong is McColonel’s proud gorilloz. Like his master, he is a storehouse of military experience.<br>While McColonel leads the human recruits, Armstrong leads the dino recruits. He can sometimes be intimidating because of his big size and muscularity, but he does not consider anyone an enemy (unless, of course, they help the Conquerors in any way).<br><br><strong>Throttle</strong>: the annoying #1 fan of Thrust and his cousin on his mother’s side. Throttle is a young wanwan who has a habit of annoying people and doesn’t understand why everybody hates him. He is also an avid attention-grabber, residing to fury when he’s not the in the hub of attention. He even colored his fur in blue to snatch the public eye. (His original color is orange.)<br>Whenever Throttle gets involved in something, he always messes things up. You can expect disaster to strike any moment when he is present in an operation or other duties. If the HACA could get rid of him, they would. The only problem is he’s too young and immature to be on his own. Small dino—big burden.<br><strong><br>Toothpick</strong>: Toothpick is a candiru—a small, transparent, parasitic catfish that feeds on blood. More accurately, he is a candiru hologram, so he cannot actually suck blood. He, like Throttle, has a tendency to annoy people. Only Toothpick annoys them intentionally for entertainment’s sake. He is rude, ill-disciplined, loud, and holds no concern for anybody whatsoever.<br>Toothpick first appeared in the Fools’ Special as Thrust’s accidental gift for Azelle. Although his time of existence is short with every episode of appearance, he occasionally shows up in a few episodes of the Under-Dome Series. <br><br><br>Okay, this thread is ready to be closed. If you would like to post a comment, post them to me via PM <strong>only</strong>.<br>See ya! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/yeah.gif"><br>P.S. Study hard, you guys! We've only got a month before summer vacation!
