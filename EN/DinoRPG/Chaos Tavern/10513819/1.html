                Hi, everybody!<br><br>Luckily, I've managed to save my story. I'll post the latest chapters here. But if you haven't read some of the previous ones, just post here and tell me which chapters you haven't read. I'll send those chapters to you via private message. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"> If you prefer to have the story from the beginning to the present (or all the way through to the upcoming end), feel free to ask, and I'll send it to you.<br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>Chapter 10: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_1.gif">Enter Grumhel<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_1.gif"> (special thanks to Killer60)<br><br>Very soon, Master Hydargol got exhausted and could barely fight any more. The korgons were getting tired, too. There was nothing I could do, but expect the worst.<br>But then, I saw the eyelid of Thrust slightly open. He lifted his head, looked around...and realized the danger. Quickly, he got to his feet, and started to perform a skill I had never seen him perform: <em>Flash wave!</em> (attacks 3 enemies with a lightning power of 10: this skill is available to the French and Spanish servers)<br>Thrust electrocuted the pirhanoz from range with aggression until the fish could not take it any longer and retreated.<br>Thrust was standing on his feet alive and strong again. I threw my arms around him in gratitude for being alive and the korgons did the same, relieved to have the wanwan back.<br>“It seems Thrust had learned <em>Flash wave</em> while in his dream. I’m impressed,” Master Hydargol said.<br>After we reached the Edge of the Forest, we parted with the Zenzen master. Amigo uttered, “Home, bitter home,” at our arrival. The forest was dark — little light could penetrate through the canopies.<br>I kneeled down to the river for a drink, but Amigo stopped me:<br>“Wait! This water is full of bacteria that only korgons can drink.”<br>“So...where can we get water from?” I asked.<br>“You get squeeze the water from this moss,” he showed me a patch of moss that grew at the bank of the river. The moss was filled with special chemicals that killed the bacteria from the water, so it was safe to drink from. That Thrust and I drank from while the korgons drank from the river.<br>Then, we continued on the mission. I knew that Nicolas Mulot was living somewhere in this area, so we searched. It was then I remember in my studies of Grumhel that is was the inhabitance of the Gate Guardians. The deeper we would move into the forest, the higher risk we would put ourselves in. So I urged everybody to keep ourselves as close to the edge as possible.<br>Finally, we found it — Nicolas Mulot’s house was located in a small opening in the forest. The sunlight could beat down freely in that area, so it was a relief to step out of the mess of trees for a moment.<br>I knocked on the door to Nicolas’ house...but no answer. I knocked again, but this time, I opened the door myself...only to look upon a terrible sight.<br>The study room, in which Nicolas was supposed to be in, was completely destroyed! Papers were scattered and torn apart and bookshelves were shredded. The only thing that seemed to be intact was a cookbook with a weird name. The other thing was more gruesome, though. It was a flag, a flag that had the following written on it: “The Conquerors”! I looked to the right and noticed a blanket covering something. When we went over to take a closer look, we could not bare the scene...a fallen gorilloz...<br>Evidently, Benroy had told the conquerors about Joe’s message. They came and harassed the place, capturing Nicolas and leaving his gorilloz for dead.<br>We had to leave; get back to Dinoland and figure out a way to defeat the conquerors. So we left the house, exited from the front door, only to find ourselves surrounded by a hundred masked korgon avengers all wearing the same conqueror’s flag on their backs like a cape. Up in front was their leader.<br>“Hey, isn’t that Krogin Hood?” Amigo wondered aloud.<br>The avenger leader stepped up and announced, “I am Krogin Hood! Leader of the Merry-Korgons! Surrender your possessions and we’ll spare your lives!”<br>“But I don’t have anything you could use!” I said, but Krogin didn’t listen.<br>“Silence, liar! Prepare to face the wrath of the conquerors with my Merry-Korgons! An enemy to the conquerors is an enemy to us!”<br>“Thrust! <em><strong>Flash wave!!</strong></em> Repetition!!”<br>Thrust fired chain-lighting at the avengers as they attacked. The rest of us took part in fending them off from a closer range. Nevertheless, there were simply too man avengers.<br>“Thrust can’t you take out more than three at a time?” I asked in desperation, but Thrust shook his head.<br>The avengers drove us back into the house. We were now completely surrounded with nowhere to go. For such small creatures, they posed a big threat when in groups.<br>But then, Thrust had an idea! When things seemed to go completely against us, Thrust snatched the cookbook in his mouth and displayed its title to the lot of the avengers. They stopped attacking! Now they were yelling and panicking and making their way out the house, into the deep forest! (Amigos stole a felled avenger’s baseball bat afterwards)<br>“No wonder,” I said, taking the book from Thrust’s mouth, “<em>100 Ways to Cook a Korgon.</em>”<br>Amigo snatched the book from my hands and uttered, “That’s sick! Top 100 of the best of the best man-chow cuisines. (Opens the book) Hey look, it’s uncle Steve!”<br>That night, it was raining hard. We had left the house of Nicolas to continue our journey. The korgons were used to the rain, but I understood how Thrust hated it. So I built a humble roof made of sticks and leaves for Thrust to sleep under (it was the best I could build). But I had no time to build one for myself, so I just lied under the rain, hoping that it would stop soon.<br>But soon, I felt a soft tug on my sleeve. When I looked, it was Thrust, soaking wet, tugging me to sleep inside the hut I had built for him. I couldn’t understand why Thrust refused to sleep under the protection of his worst enemy.<br>He stopped tugging me when he realized that I wouldn’t move because of tiredness. Instead of going inside the hut, he curled himself to sleep right beside me. I was touched — I guess love had proven itself to conquer anything. I would never forget this moment...<br><br><br>Chapter 11: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif">The Sinister Path<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><br><br>After that night, we traveled deeper still and then stopped to rest for another night. Amigo told that snakes inhabited the area, so I pitched up hammocks with vines so the snakes wouldn’t eat us.<br>“Aye,” Amigo said as we slept, “we’ve also got to watch out for the batwings...”<br> “<strong>BATWINGS!!!</strong>” Bob jumped all of a sudden and caused quite a commotion until Amigos bonked his head with the baseball bat.<br>“He’s quite skittish over batwings. I remember a korgon, named Junior, who was the first to be bitten by a batwings. After that, his mind went haywire and he could never be himself again. P.S., Junior is Bob’s second name.”<br>O_o<br>Early the next morning, I brewed some tea with wild berries. Afterwards, we left our hammocks and continued north. I and Thrust, having no experience of the dangers of the forest, expected nothing as we walked the Sinister Path. Amigo halted and shushed the lot of us, “Careful, man, this is the Sinister Path. There are so many Gate Guardians here.”<br>“Gate Guardians?” I asked skeptically, but soon realized I was ahead of myself. Amigo pointed me to a cluster of rocks and dead trees resting on the side of the path, I figured that they were living beings — Gate Guardians, not doubt.<br>“They’re the evilest creatures of Grumhel. Let’s just tiptoe our way out.”<br>At that, I took off my shoes and trod like a wanwan. With every loud step, a Guardian would shift on the ground before it went back to sleep again. It took is 30 minutes just to pass one kilometer and we were getting weary of tiptoeing. Then Amigo decided to whisper:<br>“Hey, man, if we see a bat...”<br>But he was shut up by Amigos, “In front of Bob, don’t say ‘batwings’.”<br>“BATWINGS!!!” Bob screamed and woke up the Guardians!<br>Their size was unmatchable! They were like angry gods of the forest who thought of all dinoz and humans enemies. One Guardian approached us from the front while three did from the back. I could see other Guardians from afar, as well...but now we had to act!<br>“Split up!” I shouted.<br>We took three different routes. Thrust <em>accelerated</em> past two Guardians, The three korgons just barely survived an earth-shattering punch and pressed on, and I ran into the thick woods to keep my chaser from speeding towards me.<br>I could see Thrust making a huge distance between himself and the Guardians, and then he <em>accelerated</em> back at them with <em>focus</em>, punching a hole right through both at once!...but it did not affect them! Then he charged right back on the open path and attacked my chaser, trying to electrocute it, but with no affect either.<br>As for the korgons, it seemed luck favored them most. Their little legs could not deliver them quickly, but they always escaped every Guardian’s blow.<br>My chaser was now paying attention to Thrust (who was running away at normal speed). So I turned back, made a lasso out of my rope, and hurled it over the Guardian’s head and passed the rope to Thrust as he <em>accelerated</em> back past the monster pulled onto the rope with such force that it took the Guardian to the ground! Then the punctured Guardians appeared, but Thrust leaped through their holes and tied them together. As expected, the two beasts, that could not comfortably attack the wanwan, grabbed the rope and swung it (without any idea what the weight at the end of the lasso was), missing Thrust and smashed the Guardian into pieces on a huge boulder.<br>The korgons finally met their dead-end — they were surrounded. As Thrust ran to save them, the Guardians smashed the ground where he ran, but he stealthily zigzagged pas their blows and caught the korgons.<br>From there, we ran as fast as we could, having confused the Guardians with Thrust’s <em>acceleration</em> skill. We ran until we met the edge of the Jumin River. The current was too strong for any human to beat, and so was the same with wanwan. But the korgons had no problem, as they demonstrated top us. That’s when an idea struck me.<br>“You guys paddle on, then,” I ordered.<br>“And leave you behind?” Amigo objected.<br>“I have a plan.”<br>And so the korgons paddled away as I withdrew the remaining piece of rope I had and handed it to Thrust, took out my “surfing board”, and ordered, “Thrust. <em><strong>Accelerate!</strong></em>” we sped away from the river towards the two Guardians that had been bound. I timed the moment of impact...waited...readied my free hand...and grabbed the end of the lasso. Like an overcharged playground swing, Thrust’s <em>acceleration</em> boosted us into the air...and now we were flying across the Jumin River as if launched from a catapult!...and slammed into the ground to safety...<br><br><br>Chapter 12: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_house.gif">The Korgon Camp<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_house.gif"><br><br>When I finally opened my eyes, I looked upon another weird incident: first there were Gate Guardians, and now there were a thousand copies of Amigo, Amigos, and Bob! I was surrounded by a thousand korgons who meant no harm, unlike the conqueror avengers, but now I had a hard time looking for my companions.<br>“Amigo! Amigos! Bob!”<br>“We’re right here, ya muck!” Amigo said right beneath me — the korgons were tied to my leg!<br>“What happened?”<br>“Sorry, senor, but I’d like you to meet our brothers and sisters, all victims of the batwings’ bite...”<br>“BATWINGS!!!” Bob shouted, but Amigo shut him up with his words and then continued:<br>“They think that your leg is a wooden pole to which to tie us...we’re escapees from this camp, see.”<br>“Wow...so, who’s Junior?”<br>“They’re all Junior...”<br>With a broken leg and arm from the fall, I skipped through the crowd to look for Thrust. Surprisingly, he was receiving better hospitality than the korgons tied to my leg. They were shading him, giving him fresh water, and offering him meat. But at first sight of me, he dashed and jumped into my arms, welcoming me back to the solid world.<br>“Okay, everybody, coming through, coming through,” a young woman made her way towards us and gave an apologetic look, “Sorry for the korgons, poor things...”<br>She quickly untied our companions and gave them quite a scolding for leaving the camp. The korgons pretended to be sorry, but I could tell she was driving them crazy.<br>I didn’t consider Diana Korgsay such a bad person as our korgon friends had described her. She was quite hospitable towards us and all the korgons in the camp. However, she did hold a stubborn belief that our korgons, just like the rest in the camp, were victims of the batwings’ bite.<br>Miss Korgsey tended to our wounds...at least. Having a rest from the stampede of Guardians did not make up for the delay we were going to wait to get back to Dinoland. One night, at the campfire, I asked Amigo more about the Guardians.<br>“They were supposed to be protectors of the forest from intruders, as Article 7 of the Grumhel Constitution says,...”<br>(A constitution without a nation? O_o)<br>“...but they think it means they can rule the forest as they please and there is no way to stop them. At least they’re all located across the Jumin River. Or else they would always be after us to tear our limbs apart for dinner...and sometimes lunch — they’re vegetarian during breakfast time, see.”<br>“Okay...but what about Miss Korgsey, she isn’t such a bad person.”<br>“O, so thinks you, but I don’t like her much. I’m sick and tired of being treated like I’ve been bitten by a batwings! You don’t know how relieved I was when I won three tickets to Dinoland. It’s just the war wasn’t first-class treatment. Next time, I’m going to the Magnetic Steps!”<br>That was the end of the conversation.<br>A few months had passed, my bones were fixed...and it was winter. Not just any winter—it was the coldest winter I had ever experienced! Korgons huddled together to stay warm while I and Thrust stood close to the fire for all the time we could. I overheard the weather forecast on Korgsey’s radio:<br>“Hello, everybody,” said the weatherperson, “This year’s winter is extremely chilly. The average daily temperature has gone down to -60 degrees! No one knows whether this occurred naturally, or it is a man-made incident, because it’s impossibly cold. In fact, it’s so cold, that the body of the great Volcano has almost literally become an iceberg! Although the Dinoland government tells the people that this winter is survivable and that it will help slow down the conqueror’s progress, many say that this is the coldest winter for the last 1000 year! Who knows? This could be the dawn of the ice age that wiped out the first dinoz that ever walked the face of the earth...”<br>Quite agreeable, my feet were getting numb and so were my fingers. To warm up, Thrust and I decided to play tag (he kept getting away to fast). After that, I decided to teach him a new skill: <em>hermetic aura</em>. After many attempts and encouragements, Thrust finally pulled it of — it was like a whitish force field had formed around him as an indestructible barrier — and just in time, too! All of a sudden, the ground shook and we saw the Guardians just 100 meters away!<br>The Jumin River had frozen!<br>Quickly, I and our three korgons hid under Thrust’s <em>hermetic aura</em> and we clawed to the edge of the camp. As soon as we hit safety, I ordered Thrust to save as many korgons as he could and fight the wretched Guardians. But he could do little to rescue them, much less fending off the Guardians.<br>Amigo turned to me and pointed at the mountain, the foot of the great Volcano, “This is our chance! We have to run for it!”<br>I gave Amigo an angry look, answering him, “We are not leaving these korgons to their deaths! We have to stay and fight.”<br>“We have a mission, remember? If the conquerors succeed in Dinoland, they’ll succeed anywhere! We’re running out of time, man!”<br>He was right, although I was sure I’d be stoned for this. There was nothing we could do to help the korgons and we would die if we did, leaving Dinoland no hope of surviving the war. But I promised to myself that <strong>when</strong> we took care of the conquerors, we would come back.<br>I sighed <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"> and called out, “Thrust! Abort!!” and we made our way up Mt. Big All-Hot...<br><br><br>P.S.

                Yep, Killer60 and T200 are back in business. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>Chapter 13: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_mountain.gif">The Soft Shaman<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_mountain.gif"> (Special thanks to Killer60)<br><br>We climbed higher up the mountain coated in thick snow. On several occasions, I’d almost slip down, but be saved by the rope (everybody else didn’t seem to have the problem). And as we went further, the carpet of snow began to thin, but the environment also turned gloomier at the Deep Gorges. We could see goblins huddled together, staring at us with unwelcoming faces.<br>We couldn’t continue along the path of low spirits, so we descended down the steep gorges to the only part of the volcano that in which trees flourished: The Ashkapouk Ruins. There, we had a short tour of the place before we stopped by a merguez stand.<br>“Do you accept sterrals?” I asked the seller.<br>“Sterrals? Don’t know what those are. No, I don’t. But if you have gold or silver, I wouldn’t mind. It was universal value, you know.”<br>So I gave him a nugget from my pocket.<br>We took a bite form out merguez sausages, and boy was it spicy! We gasped for the cool wonter air as I asked the seller, “Don’t you have any water?”<br>“What’s water?”<br>O_o<br>So we ate the snow instead. But on a positive note, that gold nugget did get us a big lunch and even leftovers for later.<br>I purchased several small pepper grenades and a lighter (much better than a flint) at the Forges after while we left to scale the volcano to the LavaPit. I’d be lying is if I told you it was an easy journey — it wasn’t, apart from the act that it was tense going by the Venerable’s lair. The path was unsteady and steep, but we made it at the end.<br>The first thing I saw when we reached the top was the shaman Joe told me about. He was in the middle of performing a ritual...until Bob mindlessly shouted, “Hola!” (Amigos bonked him on the head for stupidity)<br>The shaman and his candles surrounding him all fell silent. He muttered, “Not again,” and turned to us. I could tell he was irritated, but he did not express it, half-heartedly welcoming us to the warmth of the LavaPit.<br>“What was that ritual you were doing?” I asked.<br>“I asking te spirits for reason of te snow...so far, they have no give me answer. If you give me one moment, I do one more ritual.”<br>So we allowed the Soft Shaman to perform his ritual, but one moment to him was a whole hour to us. We waited, dully observing his shamanic dances and incantations. Then...the sudden burst of lava from the pit blasted us aback in shock! For a second, the lava formed into a body and rhymed with the movements of the shaman...but then subsided. The Soft Shaman sighed deeply, and then turned back to us.<br>“What’s wrong?” I asked.<br>“Spirits don’t know answer...strange.”<br>Indeed it was. I thought that spirits knew everything, since they were omnipresent beings. But for them to not know a ‘trivial’ coincidence like this was unearthly. This was getting fishy...<br>The Soft Shaman stretched out his hand, asking me for something:<br>“You give me gluon sample. I had dream you come and give me sample.”<br>“Oh, yes...right...” but I didn’t have any sample — just the whole gluon, “Sorry, all I have is this.”<br>I handed him the jar, but he didn’t accept it.<br>“You supposed to bring me sample, not whole gluon!”<br>He promptly handed back the jar, in which the gluon still tried to punch its way out, and continued, “Demons getting smart.”<br>From there, there was a moment of pause. I didn’t know what to say, but I decided to break the silence, taking out the wanted poster from my rucksack and showing it to the shaman, “I don’t know exactly what this is about, but it seems to me Thrust is being framed.”<br>The Soft Shaman closely observed the details of the poster. Then he took a handful of powder and dispersed it all over the sheet. He murmured a repetition of incantations as steam rose from the powder. The steaming ceased when his murmuring came to an end.<br>I forwarded the question, “Who is this dino?”<br>“A strange power surrounded tis dino. ‘Tis not Trust.”<br>“Thrust,” I corrected.<br>“Trust, I said Trust!...No, ‘Tis not Trust...’Tis a demon wit strange name. Ahh, evil demon, name is...K...Kille...Kille d’Arkon!”<br>“Kill Darkon?”<br>“No, Kille d’Arkon. Can’t you tell te difference? (No <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif">) Ahh, fates of fire! Trust has a fate of fire—great, majestic...perilous.”<br>“What is it?”<br>“As shaman, I must not tell you. One’s destiny must be safe witin te heart. But I tell you, Trust will soon have choice to determine his fate. And tis time, he must do it alone...witout your help.”<br>Suddenly, the Soft Shaman froze. He shot his gaze up to the sky, then briskly looked back at us...“Make haste!”<br>Sure enough, a gang of Moueffes, all wearing vests with “The Conquerors” on it, had made their up to the pit.<br>Bob squeaked, “Adios!” to the shaman and we took our flight...

                Sorry for double-posting. I hope I will be forgiven...<br><br>Chapter 14: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"> Divided <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"><br><br>As soon as we hit the snow, I took to snowboarding down the volcano as Thrust ran by my side and the korgons grabbed tight to my rucksack for safety.<br>The first moueffe shot a <em>fire ball</em> at me, but Thrust used <em>hermetic aura</em> and saved us. Then a second moueffe used <em>blowtorch palm</em> — its fist was enraged in fire — and hit the ground, creating an avalanche. However, we were fast enough to surf out of the way into a dark cave where I promptly lit my lighter. I could tell the moueffes were not too far from us — the ceiling was caving us in, but we barely made it out, only to be engirded from two sides by a duo of the half-dragons. I looked at each one of them once — they each inhaled deeply, about ready to discharge <em>burning breath</em>, but as soon as they blew, I fell on my stomach to the board, dodging the attack. Afterwards, Thrust <em>flash waved</em> them our of our way.<br>2 down, 3 to go. All of a sudden, the remaining moueffes roared and a rain of <em>meteors</em> showered down on us. I covered my head and crouched on the board as low as I could. The vibrations of every rock quaked the earth...I could barely keep standing! I knew I wouldn’t be able to hold on like that much longer...but fortunately, to my left, I spotted smoke rising in a chain-like fashion from a hole in the ground. I snatched a grenade from my pocket and hurled it over to the cave from which the smoke was escaping…<strong>BOOM!!!</strong><br>The Venerable angrily roared out of his cavern.<br>“WHO DARES?!?!” he blasted and raced down the mountain to harass the lot of us.<br>Quickly and easily, he took out the moueffes...but then charged at us, as I suspected.<br>“DIE, INTRUDERS!!!” he roared again and discharged an avalanche of fire, but we steered into a narrow crevice between two glaciers. By the time the Venerable blasted another breath of fire at us, we had exited the crevice into Basalt Slope.<br>However, across the glacier we came across more conquerors. This time, I heard a familiar shriek of an airborne dino flying over our head.<br>“Pteroz riders.” The same ones that had chased us off Dinoland. They never seemed to have enough. That blabbermouth Benroy must’ve memorized the whole letter to Nicolas. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twisted.gif"><br>They slowed down, giving way to the conqueror’s hippoclamps that shot <em>petrifaction</em> rays at us. (Amigo uttered, “Man, they remind me of my dinner,” at the sight of them.) My heart jumped with every spell that missed us. Up ahead, I could see the end of the gorge...I could not afford us to fall over that one...<br>I turned around while snowboarding backwards. Through the downpour of <em>petrifaction</em> rays, I targeted at an invisible pinpoint spot in between the pteroz and hippoclamps and threw a grenade as hard as I could...<strong>KABOOM!!!</strong> — Several things happening at once: the grenade produced an avalanche, the hippoclamps lost control and were taken prey by the snowslide, the same pteroz rider who threw us off the sand gorge commanded, “<em><strong>Combustion!!</strong></em>”, and I was fashioning a lasso with my rope.<br>I threw the lasso at a protruding rock...the pteroz crashed its beak into the ground...I grabbed unto Thrust and the petrified korgons as we swung away from the avalanche, losing my snowboard in the process. The hippoclamps fell off the gorge, and then the <em>combustion</em> of the pteroz destroyed a huge landscape! The ground beneath us began to crumble as we ran along the edge of the gorge. But as soon as the Venerable came around the corner and discharged fire, the ground beneath us could not support our weight...and we stumbled down, catching onto what remained of the ledge. I lost my rucksack in the stumble, but managed to save the jar of gluon. The unlucky pteroz ran into the Venerable’ fire and fell into the abyss below.<br>“Luck won’t save you this time, intruders!” the Venerable growled.<br>We thought we were seeing the end of us, but we were wrong...the clouds darkened in red and brown suddenly. Even the ever feared Venerable paused to look. Then, a lightning flashed scored the dragon’s side! Then hellish vines wrapped themselves around him! We were witnessing it again! — demon winkses, gorilloz, and many other races surrounded the Venerable...but that was all I could see...<br>The next moment, I felt myself lifting up in the air by a pair of claws. Thrust and the korgons were diminishing in my sight!<br>“<strong>Thrust!!</strong>” I shouted for help, but he could not do anything. As if I could linguistically understand Thrust, his long and distant meow seemed to shout <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/nooo.gif">.<br>The pteroz rider above me turned to Thrust, and in chaotic joy shouted, “Victorious be conquerors! You’ll never see your master ever again!”<br><br>To be continued...<br><br>Uhh, I noticed in the game that they write 'petrification'. Actaully, the correct way of spelling it is 'petrifaction'. Look up the dictionary. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/chart.gif"><br><br>If you would like to give me some feedback on the story, feel free. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"> I could always do with improvements.

                Ok, guys. Now that I've been kidnapped, Thrust's Tale is going to be a 3rd person story from this chapter on. Moreover, you'll now understand Thrust linguistically. So fasten your seat belts and enjoy the tale. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><br>Chapter 15: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_cavern.gif"> The BrutForce Championness <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_cavern.gif"><br><br>“NOOO!!!” Thrust’s yell echoed off the gorge wall as he let go and sped down the steep cliff. He darted down the foot of the volcano and chased the pteroz, but he was too exhausted to <em>accelerate</em>.<br>“Master!” he shouted and tried several futile attempts to <em>accelerate</em>. In the end, his lungs started to hurt and he couldn’t run anymore. He stopped in his tracks, staring at the fading pteroz and uttered deep in his heart, “I will find you. I will find you!”<br>Thrust returned to the korgons and shook them out of <em>petrifaction</em>.<br>“Man, saving this guy’s rear is so hard!” Amigo hoarsely uttered, “Where is he?”<br>“Kidnapped,” explained Thrust in a low and dangerous tone.<br>“What? Already? Why didn’t you tell me his abduction date?”<br>The wanwan didn’t answer. Debating whether to search for right away or first find a supplement to their team, to do the job, they agreed on the latter. Thrust picked up the fallen rucksack with his teeth and the lot progressed through Dinoland, being cautious not to fall into the hands of passing conquerors (Bob was used as a broom to erase the footprints in the snow). <br>A few days later, they arrived at the cave entrance where they had met the weird Madam X. Only this time, there were two guards at the grotto’s mouth.<br>Piece of cake, though — the four covertly made their way around the guards until they were on the roof of the cave entrance. Like a wanwan (which he is), Thrust landed soundlessly on the pads of his feet just behind the two sentries. The korgons dropped on top of him afterwards and they quietly proceeded deeper into the cave (Bob stuck his tongue out at the unsuspecting guards).<br>They made their way to the other side of the tunnel. When Thrust looked upon the scene before him, he could not believe his eyes! It was a mega-arena! The audience of people and dinoz alike were all over the place as they watched the duel between two competing dinoz.<br>“Whoa!” gasped Thrust, followed by Amigo:<br>“This is so <em>impresionante</em>!”<br>The four made their way up the stairs to the back row that mostly had vacant seats. Thrust put the rucksack on a neighboring seat as he and the korgons shared one.<br>“Now, all we’ve got to wait for the perfect participant to show up. He’s gonna be our guy,” Thrust stated.<br>“We’re gonna kick his tush!” Bob exclaimed excitedly.<br>“No, Thrust said we’re going to make a proposal,” Amigo explained.<br>“We’re gonna marry him?”<br>“Amigos, please explain.”<br>“Bob, how can I explain this to you in such a way that you’ll understand? (Amigos bonks him on the head with the baseball bat unconscious) No how!”<br>They spectated as new competitors got in and out of the ring. But then, something caught Thrust’s eyes. The following pair of duelers was a rocky and a wanwan, and it was that wanwan that caught Thrust’s attention. She was a light-pink wanwan, pretty and refined, and her <em>lightning dance</em> almost instantly floored her opponent to defeat...she left the ring victorious.<br>“Man,” Amigo whispered to Amigos, “He can’t take his eyes off her.”<br>It was only when she left the arena did Thrust say, “I think we should sit somewhere closer.”<br>They moved down and chose the middle row, passing through spectators and finding two vacant seats. Then they watched more matches until she appeared again. This time, she was dueling with a sirain. Thrust would not dare blink — he was too intrigued by her speedy assaults as she obliterated the sirain after an intense match.<br>“Ladies and gentlemen,” the tournament organizer announced, “we have finally come to the conclusion of this year’s Brutforce tournament! I give you the World Champion of the Year — <strong>Azelle the wanwan!!!</strong><br>The audience roared in applause as Thrust’s eyes followed her leaving the ring back to her master...Benroy!<br><strong><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"> O_O <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"></strong><br>Thrust shook his head...She was one of them! So she would definitely know where Thrust’s master was. He promptly gave the order, “That’s the one! Let’s go!”<br>They followed her into a vacant room where she was alone, drinking from a stone sink. Thrust and the korgons were around the corner of a wall behind her, but they couldn’t charge just like that — there was a mirror at the sink which she could look at any moment.<br>“You guys distract her,” Thrust told his buddies.<br>“No problem.”<br>Azelle stopped drinking and was grooming herself when a trio of masked korgons popped right in front of her.<br>“Surrender! We’ll spare your life if you come along quietly,” Amigo demanded (after which Bob said, “Hola!”).<br>“Yeeaaaa,” she yawned, “And who were you?”<br>“Who are we? Isn’t it obvious, senorita? We came to kidnap you!”<br>“Right, good luck with that. If you don’t mind, I’m going to be leaving now.”<br>But she barely took a step when Thrust charged in and shoved her to a wall, hollering, “You’re coming with us!”<br>“Ahhhh!! Wild dino! Wild...”<br>But Thrust stuck his paw into her mouth. When he took it out, she started shouting for help again.<br>“Stick a cork in it!” he commanded (and Bob was the cork: the korgons stuck him into Azelle’s mouth so that she couldn’t make a noise.<br>That done, Amigo and Amigos tied Azelle to Thrust, back to back, so that he carried her like a knapsack — and they slipped away before any help could arrive...

                Thanks, Killer, you keep up the good work too! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>Chapter 16: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_fj.gif"> Incidents <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_fj.gif"> (Special thanks goes to Killer60)<br><br>By the time Bob was plucked out of Azelle’s jaw (after which he said, “Gracias.”), they had arrived at the Fountain of Youth. The korgons untied her from Thrust, but then made a leash on her so that she couldn’t run away.<br>“Stop struggling and get used to the wilderness,” said Thrust after listening to all her complaints.<br>“Easier said than done. I mean, do you want me to become something like you: all scruffy and...and feral? Look at you! Don’t you ever groom yourself?”<br>“Ha, don’t need to!” But then Thrust turned to Amigo and whispered, “What’s grooming?”<br>Amigo raised his shoulders (and Azelle rolled her eyes at that).<br>Suddenly, Amigos called everybody together when he spotted a hole right at the foot of the fountain. In that hole was water frozen by the winter weather — but even so, Thrust could sniff it out and identify the liquid. Its properties were definitely dissimilar to the regular salt water from the fountain itself.<br>“Pure water,” Thrust deduced, “I’ve never scented such a thing. Strange...”<br>Then Amigo pointed at a cluster of frozen footprints of various dinoz. Thrust sniffed the nearest one to him...it was a gorilloz. He scented the one further away...and it was the same gorilloz. Only this time, the footprint seemed to have expanded in size and had the scent of the pure water, whereas the former lacked that scent.<br>Thrust inspected some more, finding foot prints of a young sirain, humans, and a rocky. For a moment, he couldn’t put the puzzle pieces together. Everything seemed bizarre and unnatural. But then, pictures of the past flashed back through his eyes! He started vigorously sniffing the ground of each footprint, speaking as he scented, “Gorilloz drinks water (sniffs)...gorilloz attacks sirain (sniffs)...sirain fights back (sniffs)...gorilloz too fast (sniffs)...gorilloz strikes again (sniffs)...rocky appears...and defends sirain (sniffs)...rocky defeats gorilloz (sniffs)...that’s it.”<br>“So...what happened?” Amigo asked.<br>“A gorilloz is given the pure water by his master. Afterwards, it attacks a sirain situated not so far away. The sirain tries to fight back, but the speed of the gorilloz was too much, so it knocks the sirain down. But before the gorilloz could perform the final blow, a rocky stands up for the sirain and wins the battle for him.”<br>“Strange...then there is something wrong with this water.”<br>“Exactly. I don’t like the scent of it. It’s giving me the heebie-jeebies...It’s getting late, though. We should set camp and rest up.”<br>They found a hollow spot of a large tree caused by the fighting. In there they lit a fire and sat around it. Of course, the evening wasn’t a quiet one because of Azelle’s never-ending grumble and sulking.<br>She demanded, “I command you release me at this instance!”<br>“If I do, are you going to escape?”<br>“Well, duh! After all this treatment you’ve given me, I’m going back to Benroy!”<br>“Yea, very unlikely,” Amigo entered the conversation.<br>But surprisingly, Thrust protracted a claw and severed the rope binding Azelle. The bewildered female looked a bit astonished at Thrust’s action, but then said, “You must be dumb...”<br>She made her way outside while speaking to herself, “Okay, which way should I go? East...right, east. Okay...it’s this way...”<br>The four watched Azelle disappear through into the forest. Amigo turned to Thrust and asked, confused, “I thought east was that way (pointing to a different direction than where Azelle went).”<br>“It is,” answered Thrust with a snicker, “And she thought we were dumb.”<br>“Well, we think she’s dumb, so...I guess it works out!”<br>A few minutes later, Azelle returned: she made a full circle without knowing it. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"> She went into other random direction, but always landed at the same spot, back to the fountain. She did that four more times until she finally gave up:<br>“Alright! You win! Give me some food!”<br>She snatched a few of the merguez that they were dining on, but Thrust tried to warn her, “You might want to be careful with those...”<br>“I am a BrutForce world champion!” she interrupted, “And I don’t need anyone’s advice!”<br>But as soon as she took her first bite, the spiciness of the merguez punished her tongue! She ran towards the Fountain of Youth and sucked up a mouthful of water, but then spit <em>that</em> out. She writhed in spicy pain for a while...until Thrust duly offered her snow...<br><br>---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- ----------------------<br><br>I was thrown in a cell by the conquerors. Fortunately, my cell mates were the people I was looking for: Grandfather Joe, Professor Eugene, and Nicolas Mulot!<br>“So how was your journey?” asked Joe, but I just nodded. He continued, “Did you get the gluon sample?”<br>“I did, but Nicolas has been long captured by then.”<br>“Yea, they barged in quite spontaneously. I wasn’t suspecting anything,” Nicolas sighed.<br>I gave the jar of gluon to Nicolas, but he couldn’t do anything, now that we were lacking lab equipment.<br>“I can’t do anything with this. I’m going to need advanced equipment to retrieve a sample.”<br>“Actually,” Eugene said, “there is a technique to do so.”<br>Nicolas handed him the jar as Eugene attached a piece of string to a small plastic bag. Carefully, he separated an iota of the gluon, trapped it inside the plastic bag, and spun it by the string’s end.<br>“The idea is to allow gravity to surface the heavier molecules to the bottom of the bag. It’s those molecules that we need,” Eugene explained.<br>But Joe was a little doubtful of that idea, “You need a very strong machine to do that. Human power is not good enough.”<br>Eugene wasn’t listening; he kept spinning...

                Here's another chapter:<br><br>Chapter 17: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_mountain.gif"> The Burning Hills <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_mountain.gif"> (Special thanks to Killer60)<br><br>They continued west towards Dinotown, much against Azelle’s desire. But she was at their fingertips, so she had no other option.<br>The first thing they saw when they arrived was horrendous! What was once a prosperous and lush town harmonizing with nature now was nothing but a trash heap of debris. Thrust strode slowly past the razed buildings and abandoned homes: it was as if a stone fell on his heart.<br>Then, he found the one place he remembered the earliest of his youth. There the alley was, the walls still stood, but just. The trash bin he used to have trouble climbing up was still there (Azelle showed a disgusted look at it). Thrust looked at the corners of the alley and recalled the time his master took pity and adopted him.<br>They continued north...<br>They got to the University, now finally fallen to the conquerors. Its pillars could barely hold the massive structure, but Thrust took his chances. He strode into the building, looking for the dormitory of his master...and there it was. Thank goodness it was the least damaged room in all the University’s chambers! He spotted the coat his master caught him with at the alley, and snug himself into it for a time of remembrance. Nobody said a word: nobody could interrupt Thrust recalling his bittersweet memories.<br>They continued north...<br>They had arrived at the Precipitous Hills...but it wasn’t precipitous anymore! There were no trees! No grass! No, nothing! The Precipitous Hills had become a hell on earth. The korgons, experts of plant life, examined various spots on the ground where the trees were supposed to be.<br>“These roots aren’t makin’ any effort to grow back!” Amigo felt alarmed.<br>Thrust sniffed the flattened lands and then abruptly shook his head.<br>“<em>Toxic cloud.</em>”<br>“Poison!” grunted Amigo, “These conquerors are going to pay for their crimes!”<br>Thrust recommenced sniffing, spotting footprints of various dinoz, but mainly those of <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_2.gif"> &amp; <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif">.<br>“Moueffes attacked these hills. Water dinoz tried to defend...but failed.”<br>That was the last that anyone said. Knowing that they could do nothing to revive the hills, they left...<br><br>Meanwhile...<br><br>A demon made its way through the gates of the conqueror’s base, being covered by two moueffes on his left and right. His size was massive! Even the conquerors’ dinoz, whose side he was on, crouched to a submissive position so as to avoid his wrath. The demon was a wanwan, dark-yellow and was as large as a fully grown lion!<br>He finally made his way to the conference room: he opened the large doors and entered the chamber, becoming the center of attention for a moment.<br>“So,” the commander-in-chief uncomfortably said, “you have come, Kille?”<br>“Forgive me,” said the demon, “but it seems there had been a planned drawback in the operation, if you know what I mean.”<br>The leaders at the conference stared to murmur to each other, raising the anxiety in the air. The commander-in-chief, sitting between the admiral and the aerial commander, tried to hide his worries and carried on, “Well, we’ve just been discussing the invasion on the eastern coast of Dinoland.”<br>“And?”<br>“Kille d’Arkon, as the only dino and demon to be a dinoz master, you have done an excellent job conducting your moueffe army, especially in the Precipitous Hills. Also, your dinoz are the only ones who do not carry the vests of our symbol, making them the special force of our army. But this time, to annihilate east Dinoland — we have decided to assign this mission to our head admiral (indicating the person to his right), the finest naval officer we have.”<br>“What, you don’t trust a direct siege from land?” Kille challenged the commander-in-chief.<br>“Well...we do, but we will not have the water as much as they will if we attack by land.”<br>“That is as incorrect as much as you are trying to ban me...”<br>The atmosphere froze. Every leader looked at the ambitious Kille d’Arkon and then looked at their head leader for a solution. But he couldn’t move his mouth as well.<br>“First of all, the Dinolanders are experts of land navigation; quite the opposite on water,” Kille continued, “If you attack them by sea, you give them the land, so you give them the biggest advantage on us. And if you drive them westward, then they can find this hidden base, no doubt about it. Second of all, you already know this; you were discussing a siege on land before I entered. Without the permission of His Majesty, Honorus Arkon, you have no authority to ban me from being a conqueror. Now, that’s all I wanted to say; I must be going.”<br>Kille left the conference room, leaving the conqueror leaders troubled.<br>“He’s getting too rebellious. He could turn around on us any moment,” said the command-in-chief, “Admiral! Kille will try to launch his own siege by land to collect the credit for himelf. We must stop him, even if it means by water!”<br>“Yes, sir!”<br>On the other side of the door, Kille commanded his moueffes, “Vex! Thwart! Ready the troops!”<br>The moueffes saluted and dashed to the job...<br><br>Plot explanation: While Thrust investigates the ruins left by the conquerors, the leaders of the terrible army plot to expand their influence through eastern Dinoland, and at the same time get rid of Kille d'Arkon, as they fear he could turn around and try to overthrow their commander-in-chief. But Kille has other plans...

                Will I be banned for triple-posting on my own thread?<br><br>Chapter 18: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"> The Dreadful Skill <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"><br><br>I drew my knife and stuck it into the lock. But only after several attempts of unlocking it, Nicolas said, “You can’t open it that way. The door needs a rare two-way key.”<br>“Then somebody give me a pin or toothpick,” I replied, but nobody had anything.<br>Finally, Professor Eugene was done. He detached the darker, heavier molecules that had grouped together at the bottom of the bag and began to study them.<br>Then, I remembered Eugene telling me about abandoned wanwans becoming feral. Thrust was out there without me, so I feared he could return to the wilderness. My only hope was that he would remember me...<br><br>---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- ----------------------<br><br>Thrust led the others deeper into the forest until they were lost. He sniffed the ground for a clue to find his master, but he found nothing.<br>All of a sudden, for the first time, Thrust was disoriented! Suddenly he didn’t know where north or south was! (The same goes for east and west.) He didn’t know from where the sun rises or where it sets! He started to feel angry...the kind of anger he had never experienced before, as if he wanted to abandon everything in the world. The korgons and Azelle were starting to get worried.<br>Then, a wolf appeared in the distance, glancing at him. And as it did, Thrust could hear voices, something like the wolf was talking to his mind.<br>“You are free...” the voice hissed, “Do you really want a master?...Do you really want to be a slave?...”<br>Thrust promptly <em>focused</em> on the wolf, knocking it down, but then another wolf rushed out from a bush...and the voices persisted.<br>This time, Azelle <em>focused</em> on the wolf in aid of Thrust, but more appeared.<br>“Be free...” the voices haunted him, “Free from slavery...Master yourself...”<br>Now they were surrounded by four wolves: Thrust <em>flash waved</em> them, but more came...<br>Thrust and Azelle were now fighting vigorously: Thrust zapped as many as he could with <em>flash wave</em> while Azelle harassed them with <em>lightning dance</em>. The korgons did their part too: A wolf threw a <em>bite</em> at Amigo, but he grabbed Bob and used him as a shield. The wolf had the little korgon in his jaw, but couldn’t crunch him down, which gave Amigos the time to bang the wolf unconscious. Amigo plucked Bob out and coolly said, “Nothing gets more elastic than Bob.<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif">” <br>Eventually, the five were surrounded by the whole pack — a super-pack! There were wolves everywhere! At least thirty of them were engirding the korgons and wanwans. Thrust could hear their voices hissing in him, “Be free...Look at you, you are better without your master...You have the world at your fingertips...Nature calls you...She wants you near...Leave everything behind and go back!...”<br>“Guys,” said Amigo to his fellow korgons, “I just want you to know that if I die...you’re coming with me! (Amigos bonks him on the head) Ouch!”<br>Thrust shook his head to drive away the devilish voices, but they wouldn’t leave. Now he was seeing things! As if the sunlight was killed, the whole scenery was blacker than night! The wolves were glowing strangely, making them look more monstrous and evil. Feral anger coursed through his veins...<br>A wolf launched a <em>bite</em>, Thrust tried to counter it, but he was too late — it locked its jaw on the wanwan’s neck. The others tried to help, but they were blocked in by the rest of the pack. <br>Thrust struggled, but the wolf’s teeth were slowly crushing him. He was starting to lose air, everything was blackening, his energy was depleting...until the voice finally hissed an order, “<em>Primal state!!</em>”<br>The wolf let go after being zapped harshly. Thrust was at his full fury, a feeling like he had just become the most powerful and terrible being on earth!...and it was so! His <em>flash wave</em> chain lightning extended to almost all the wolves! The power of his <em>focus</em> blasted in all directions with every hit! And his <em>hermetic aura</em> was like a forceful gust that rammed all the wolves away.<br>The super-pack slowly got to its feet, in pain and exhaustion. But it was evident that the battle wasn’t over when a green giant appeared. The wolves gave way to it as it approached Thrust and his team. Both beasts charged at each other, only one would make it alive! But Thrust’s <em>primal state</em> gave him the edge...and he <strong>finished</strong> his opponent in a flash...<br>Finally, the pack gave up and ran away. But to Thrust’s friends, they were unaware of what to feel. Even Azelle showed worried sympathy as Thrust growled like a heated lion...<br><br>So, anyway, as I've said in the second chapter that if a wanwan is left in the wild, it will eventaully returned to its feral state. This is exactly what's happening with Thrust. His beastial instincts are slwoly taking over. To be continued, baby<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/lol.gif">

                Chapter 19: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"> Rage of Vengeance <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"><br><br>The Frish Port was burning under the mercy of flames. Kille watched from afar his moueffe army annihilating the defender dinoz. His intention was to cut off all imports of supplies from other nations to starve Dinoland to submission. Either way, he thought to himself, he was going to progress towards eastern Dinoland.<br>A defender gorilloz found Kille who was accompanied by Vex. Vex protracted the spike from his fist and charged, but the gorilloz used its shear power to knock the moueffe out of the way. But Kille showed no fear at all. The gorilloz launched an attack: it sent <em>vines</em> to hold the demon down, but Kille’s swift reaction zapped the gorilloz mercilessly with <em>flash wave</em>.<br>Vex got to his feet and limped towards Kille, bowing in repentance for not getting rid of the defender.<br>“Never mind,” hissed Kille, “you’re not the strongest dino anyway.”<br>After a while, Kille decided to participate in the battle himself. By that time, most of the defenders had been taken care of. A sirain shot <em>water canon</em> at him, but he evaded it and bit its neck with <em>diamante fangs</em>, leaving it for dead. He slowly strode to the end of the battlefield, where the remaining <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_2.gif"> dinoz gathered.<br>The defender masters shouted to their dinoz, “<em>Cold shower!!</em>”<br>So the rain poured. It quenched the flames on the houses by only a bit. But the conqueror moueffes were not affected! Kille halted his army and approached the remaining dinoz himself. There were 20 defender dinoz left, and the rain drenching the demon wanwan’s <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif">-conducting fur...but he didn’t need <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif">. The <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_2.gif"> dinoz attacked with various skills, but Kille evaded them all, one by one biting the life our of their necks with <em>diamante fangs</em>. It was an intense fight. Elemental powers and spells flew all over the place, but none of them could find their way to their demon target. Soon, the battle was over...the Frish Port had fallen.<br>Kille called upon Thwart and ordered, “Send word to Lord Honorus and occupy the area until the hippolamps arrive. Next stop: BrutForce. And take these humans captive...except those two.”<br>Thwart grunted in reply and chained the humans. The two that Kille had indicated trembled in fear as he approached them. The demon began with the boy:<br>“Name?”<br>But the young Zenzen monk was too frightened to answer.<br>“Children...” Kille taunted, then turned to the larger man and asked him, “You, chubby. Name?”<br>“Joveboze,” his voice shivered from fear.<br>“Occupation?”<br>But Joveboze didn’t understand the language.<br>“I’m not talking your language?”<br>Joveboze lifted his shoulders.<br>“Never mind. You two are going to be quite useful to me. Come, prisoners.”<br>Kille went forward and had the two follow him. But before Joveboze walked away, he looked at the water bellow the deck he stood on. A creature stared at him from the water. Silently, Joveboze took a small flute from his pocket and passed it to the creature. It swam away with the instrument...<br><br>Enjoy! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>P.S. To whom are my chapters too long?

                Alright then, I'll stop using symbols for elements. Thanks for the feedback <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>Chapter 20: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_door.gif"> Back to the Alley <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_door.gif"><br><br>At the Market Place...<br><br>Thrust snuck beneath a wooden stand full of fish. The merchant was cooperating with one of his customers, and so didn’t notice the wanwan nicking a pair of his lujidanee groupers. Thrust stole away with them...<br>The korgons and Azelle were waiting in a vacant alley. Amigo searched in the rucksack to find the goblin merguez, but there was nothing left.<br>“This guy’s got an impossible appetite!” Amigo referred to Thrust. Ever since Thrust had met his wild side, he had had a ferocious craving for meat.<br>Thrust returned with two lujidanee groupers in his mouth, dropped them and said, “Dinner is served.”<br>Sadly, the korgons weren’t used to eating raw fish; even Azelle, the home-bred wanwan, showed hesitation to eat it.<br>“What? Haven’t heard of sushi?” Thrust said testily.<br>“Thrust, aren’t we supposed to be looking for your master?” Azelle asked, but Thrust didn’t answer. She continued, “I thought this mission was important to you.”<br>“Yes, it <strong>was</strong>.”<br>Everybody fell silent. His words had just punctured a hole in their minds.<br>Then Amigo, to ease the anxiety, announced, “Well, we are now the wild guys!” with an artificial smile.<br>Thrust, however, did not notice that Amigo was faking the happy-talk, “Yep, welcome to the alley.”<br>“Woo-hoo! Maybe we should give ourselves a name.”<br>“Si, but let Thrust think of one,” replied Amigos.<br>“Oh, come one, how hard can it be? Let’s call ourselves the Second Order of Krogin Hood!”<br>“Or how about the Wilderness Team?”<br>“No, no, how about the Alley Cats?...dumb name.”<br>After they had finished eating, Azelle requested that she be given some private space. But Thrust sent Amigo with her to act as a ‘chaperone’, saying, “Keep an eye on her.”<br>However, it wasn’t total privacy that Azelle needed. And as Amigo was on her side, and Thrust lying around in the alley, they arrived at another alley in the Market Place and started discussing.<br>“What’s wrong with him?” Azelle said.<br>“It’s his wild side. You see, senorita, Thrust was born in the wild and was adopted when he was really little. So he is really a born-to-be-wild spirit.”<br>“But I don’t understand. He seemed to love his master so much.”<br>“I can’t understand that either, senorita. But I do remember a shaman telling us that Thrust would have to face a choice. I guess he was talking about this.”<br>“Amigo, you’re not making yourself clear. Sorry to be so rude, but please tell me plainly.”<br>“Easier said than...how I shall say it...<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/huh.gif"> But I think that his instincts and conscience are fighting each other. His instincts tell him to be wild, but his conscience tells him to find his master. So far, it looks like the instincts are winning. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif">”<br>As much as he was worried, Amigo was surprised to see Azelle showing concern for Thrust.<br><br>---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- ----------------------<br><br>It felt like I was wasting away in the cell with a bunch of old timers with me (except for Nicolas). Professor Eugene was still working on the sample. He had been doing that for 72 hours straight already (if you doing count the length of the breaks), and I was getting bored!<br>Then Grandfather Joe broke the silence, “Did you get my letter back?” he asked me.<br>“Huh? Oh, yes! I think I have it with me...here.”<br>“Read it.”<br>So I read the whole thing through. Okay, it was understandable, but the post script did not make any sense.<br>“What does ‘<strong>EEloz azaldouip</strong>’ mean?” I asked him.<br>“Turn the letter upside-down.”<br>So I turned it...and was shocked at the reading!<br>“<em>dinoplaza 20133!!</em>”<br>“That’s the address of main camp-base of the conquerors in Dinoland and is where we are now,” said Joe calmly.<br>“So...you didn’t send this message to tell Nicolas about me, you sent it because you knew what was coming?”<br>“They say wisdom comes with age. I knew we’d all be stranded in this cell sooner or later. And whether or not had I sent the message to Nicolas, they would’ve seized him anyway. And so to fool whoever would intercept the delivery, I wrote that tall letter that was a phony all along. The real message is in that insignificant post script. I was hoping that you’d understand that, but unfortunately, the only thing I didn’t expect was that you would join us here.”<br>Joe sighed deeply — my capture must have been a gunshot at his hope. But thanks to him, mine was still up and running.<br>I wrote ‘upside-down’ near the post script of the letter and then folded it into a paper plane and gave it some minor adjustments so that it would fly upwards in high winds. Sure enough, the wind was blowing hard that day, so I stuck my hand out of the window and gave the plane a gentle throw...<br><br>A little extra:<br>EUGENE: “Wait, if that letter’s a phony, then the gluon’s just a scam? I’ve been wasting my time?!”<br>GRANDPA JOE: “I couldn’t stop you — you were having so much fun.”<br>EUGENE: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/surprised.gif">

                Sorry for the delay.<br><br>This one is the longest chapter I've written so far, so take your time, guys. Enjoy! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>Chapter 21: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"> Burning Down the House <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"> (Special thanks to Killer60)<br><br>A week  had passed, they were still at the alley, and the korgons were getting more concerned than ever — now Azelle was becoming the victim of her instincts. She stopped grooming herself and was ‘too attached’ with nature.<br>“Oh, senorita! Look at you! All scruffy like Thrust! When was the last time you groomed?” Amigo asked after Azelle returned from hunting.<br>“Come on, it’s the alley,” she replied, “Who needs grooming?”<br>It wasn’t long, though, until they heard a bombarding sound from somewhere nearby. Then, Thrust could scent the smoke of fire. The five went to observe the Market Place...and their hearts raced! A whole lot of moueffes were on a rampage of the market! Fire spewed from their mouths and fists into houses and stalls and defender dinoz. Then, an assault from the sea joined in the chaos, blocking all of the Dinolanders escape routes. Thrust growled furiously and wanted to fight, but then his instincts told him that he wouldn’t win.<br>And so, they snuck away past charging moueffes and made their way into the forest. A few days of travel, and they were now safe.<br>Azelle climbed a tree and started playing in the canopies while Thrust and the korgons trod forward. Suddenly, Thrust found a paper lying in a bush. He retrieved and opened it and asked Amigo to read it for him (he couldn’t read human language).<br>“dinoplaza 20133...that’s where your master is! Look!”<br>In that instant, Thrust felt a longing for his master. He felt guilty of how he listened to his instincts rather than his conscience. And now that the letter clearly described his whereabouts, he could finally see him again.<br>“Azelle,” he called, “get down from there. We’re going to look for my master.”<br>“What? But I thought we were wild.”<br>“Yea, well, I have to find him. Now get down or so help me.”<br>“Ain’t gonna!” She sat still on a tree branch with her back facing them and chin way up. But the branch was weak...and snapped!<br>Thrust dashed to her aid, falling on the ground where she would land on to act as a cushion...and...THUD!!!<br>“OOOOUUUUUUUCCCCHHHH!!!!!!!!” The impact had cracked Thrust’s spine. The korgons then tied him to Azelle back-to-back so that she could carry him.<br>AMIGO: “Nice save, man, nice save.”<br>THRUST: “Whatever...”<br><br>A few hours later, Thrust’s pain had eased enough so that he could walk again (besides, Azelle was struggling to carry his weight). But just as they untied him, a pteroz landed at the site... Benroy...<br>“Azelle? There you are!”<br>But Azelle hissed at him as a reply.<br>“She says she doesn’t want to be part of the conquerors,” translated Amigo.<br>Benroy tried to make an innocent smile, but failed. “Look, I...I did my best to raise you.”<br>But she hissed more.<br>“She said that for all these years, you lied to her. She doesn’t want to be your slave any more.”<br>“But Azelle...I...I...please...”<br>She still wouldn’t change her mind.<br>“Fine then,” Benroy gave an irritated look and then called someone from behind, “I need help.”<br>BOOM!!!...A rocky trampled its way to the pteroz side. Its master was a conqueror and friend of Benroy, Ardown.<br>“You still can’t win!” said Amigo, “Look at us: two wanwans, three korgons — full house, baby!”<br>“Then I’ll just burn down the house!”<br>“Eternity! <em>Lightning!!</em>” commanded Ardown, but Thrust triggered his <em>hermetic aura</em> over the five (the lightning was continual).<br>“On my command,” he said, “Run out of the shield and attack...Now!”<br>Azelle <em>accelerated</em> out of the aura and charged at Eternity, but was blocked by Benroy’s pteroz, A.C.E. The korgons charged at Eternity, but their little arms were too small to even turn the attention of the rocky.<br>Azelle used <em>flash wave</em> but missed A.C.E. In return, A.C.E. threw a <em>fire ball</em> but also missed.<br>Thrust was still under the curse of <em>lightning</em>. He couldn’t hold on for much longer. He timed the moment to attack, “3...2...1...Now!” He ran out of his own aura, charged with an <em>acceleration</em> and <em>focus</em> combo, but Eternity triggered its own <em>hermetic aura</em>.<br>“Thrust!” shouted Azelle, “You handle my master, I’ll take care of the rocky.”<br>So they switched places. Eternity used <em>lightning</em> on Azelle, but she used <em>lightning conductor</em> to channel the energy and <em>focused</em> on Eternity, bashing a huge crack into its body. But it healed the crack with <em>leafy dawn</em>.<br>A.C.E. hurtled <em>fire balls</em> all over the place whilst in the air, but Thrust easily evaded them with <em>acceleration</em>. But then A.C.E. summoned <em>lava flow</em>: the snow melted and lava started boiling from the ground, restricting Thrust’s <em>acceleration area</em>.<br>Eternity was giving the BrutForce championess a hard time. It fired <em>lightning</em> and even <em>blazing twilight</em> at Azelle. Plus, it had more initiative than Azelle because of its <em>hazard </em> skill. And every time Azelle scored a hit at the rocky, it would use <em>leafy dawn to heal itself</em>. But the most irritating thing was its <em>hermetic aura</em> — Azelle could not break through it! Finally, the korgons gave up on their little punches and drew back. A lamp started to glow over Amigo’s head: he implanted Bob into the ground and tied a rope to his arms. Then, he took a small pepper grenade nocked it on his ‘rubber band slinger’, whispered, “Let’s see whose house burns down first,” and fired!<br>The explosion shocked Eternity into closing its <em>hermetic aura</em>, thus giving the chance for Azelle to perform <em>lightning dance</em>. She attacked its eyes mercilessly, the weak point of any rocky, until it could take no more and finally collapsed!<br>Benroy could not tolerate the intense duel anymore. He commanded, “A.C.E., it’s win or bust! <em>Kamikaze!!</em>”<br>A.C.E. came diving down beak-first towards Thrust. The impact was a massive blast, throwing dirt and sand in all directions!...but A.C.E. missed by a single inch! Thrust turned off his <em>hermetic aura</em>, gave the pteroz the touch of his paw, and electrocuted it.<br>A bunch of flags with blazing earths and ‘The Conquerors’ written on it fell from Benroy’s sack, but he didn’t notice. Angrily, he got up form the ground, and turned to Thrust, “This isn’t over, wanwan! Your master will suffer! I’ll be sure of that...”<br>Benroy and Ardown retreated with their fallen dinoz. The korgons paraded with joy, shouting, “Woooooo!! Our first PvP battle! Yea!”<br>Then Thrust turned to Azelle and quietly said, “So you really didn’t know anything about the conquerors up until now?”<br>Azelle truthfully shook her head.<br>“Then you have my trust,” he finished...<br><br>A little extra:<br>AMIGO (to Azelle): “Looks like you got Thrust-trust. Get it? Thrust-trust?”

                Chapter 22: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_church.gif"> Breaking Free (1/2) <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_church.gif"><br><br>After the raid on the Market Place was over, Kille d’Arkon and the Admiral got together in the midst of the burning ruins. It seemed all that was needed to conquer the eastern coast of Dinoland was a peaceful agreement. Kille made a compromise with the admiral to share the credits.<br>But then, something caught the demon’s nose. The scent in an alley was familiar, as if he knew the creature that had been there...“The nuisance...”<br>Kille <em>accelerated</em> westward as quickly as he could.<br><br>---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- ----------------------<br><br>Thrust detached five flags from their poles and gave one each to wear as a vest or cape. Then they proceeded westward to Dinoplaza. A few days later, they arrived.<br>It was a marvelous area and would become a popular tourist attraction. But for the time being, it was under construction. Only a few people and dinoz were there...but the five knew that they were all conquerors.<br>After a bit of searching, they found the address that they were looking for. It was probably the largest building in Dinoplaza! Yet the atmosphere was gloomy and dark when they entered. Inside were two guards to the second door of the main entrance: a dark-blue wanwan and a night-sky black gorilloz.<br>“Halt!” said the wanwan, “Address yourselves.”<br>The five were a bit confused at the beginning and didn’t know what to say.<br>“Names?” asked the wanwan (with a hint of irritation in his voice).<br>“Azelle,” promptly replied the female.<br>“Amigo, Amigos, and Bob,” stated Amigo.<br>But Thrust thought that he had to think one up: “...Throttle.”<br>“Master’s name?”<br>Azelle immediately and boldly spoke out, “Benroy.”<br>“Check if there’s a Benroy in the membership list,” the wanwan told his co-guard.<br>“... There is...and I do see he has Azelle.”<br>“Then maybe they must be telling the truth. Access approved!”<br>They were allowed to go in (Thrust was passing the guard wanwan when he said, “Jeez! Don’t you ever groom?”)<br>The entrance hall was empty. Various corridors were connected to it with boards saying, ‘Sectors A-F’ or ‘Sectors J-O’, etc. They were about to go through a corridor when the guard wanwan called out, “Hey! All wanwans at sector B for a membership gathering. And you, korgons, sector P.”<br>At that, Thrust whispered to Amigo, “Find a way to master.”<br>“Si.”<br>They split up from there with the rucksack in the korgons’ possession. The korgons stopped in the middle of the corridor where no one could see them.<br>“I have a plan,” said Amigo.<br>“Out of all your plans, how many actually worked?” doubted Amigos.<br>“No, listen to me. We go in to the room where korgon avengers are and then use our secret weapon.”<br>“Bob?”<br>“No, something else.”<br>Meanwhile, the wanwans found their sector and entered. It was a room full of their own specie, but they received little attention when they entered. Azelle turned to Thrust and asked, “What now?”<br>“We’ve got to distract everybody so that master can escape safely.”<br>“And how do we do that?”<br>“We wait for the signal.”<br>The korgons arrived at their sector. Almost immediately after they entered, Amigo, quite foolishly, announced, “Buenos días! As all you guys are avengers, I’d like say on behalf of my tribe — we’re not!”<br>And now the three were surrounded by many sharp edges of spears. Amigo wasn’t moved, though, but took out the <em>100 Ways to Cook a Korgon</em> book and displayed it. The avengers all dropped their javelins in fear and all ran out of the room!<br>“I never thought korgons would be so skittish over a book,” said Amigos.<br>“Wait till they see Uncle Steve!”<br>The korgon avengers ran into the entrance hall, causing a commotion with their panicking. The guards ditched their duty to see the situation for themselves.<br>“We’re dinner!” an avenger grabbed onto the wanwan’s leg, but he shook him off and then pressed the button on his collar.<br>“Intruder alert! I repeat, intruder alert!”<br>The alarm sounded through all the radios of the building. The wanwans in sector B all ran out the room in search of the intruder, who was actually right under their noses. To Thrust and Azelle, this was the signal. They went along with the stream of wanwans, pretending to be on the chase for the ‘mole’.<br>“Keep them busy,” Thrust told Azelle while he waited for an ambush opportunity.<br>After everyone had left the corridor, the dark-blue wanwan ran through to inform the humans, but he didn’t suspect that the intruder was there with him. Thrust stalked him from behind, leaped on him, and the two started wrestling. However, the wild wanwan had the upper hand; winning the fight, he used his teeth to detach the collar which started beeping once it left its wearers neck.<br>Thrust dashed into an empty sector, knowing that the human conquerors were coming for the tracking device in his mouth...perfect!<br>They ran after the red dot on the radar. But they were totally unprepared for the intruder...<br>ZAP!!!

                You'll find out soon enough. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>Chapter 23: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_church.gif"> Breaking Free (2/2) <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_church.gif"><br><br>The korgons were now in the ventilation system. Though it was a maze in there, they managed to find what they were looking for.<br>I, in the cell, had had a conversation with Eugene. He told me that there had been studies on wild dinoz. Wild dinoz tend to be stronger than those born in captivity, because their inherent primal instincts are better developed in the wild. That also means that a wild dino could learn a skill that doesn’t belong to its element.<br>Still, I had little hope for Thrust returning. With the time that had passed, he was probably deep in touch with his feral state.<br>“You?” a voice with a Russian accent called from behind...I was shocked to see it was really him.<br>“Igor?” I said, half surprised, and yet half aggravated.<br>“So, eet’s nameless, eez it?” he taunted, “Ha! I never tought you’d be a pest.”<br>“What the hell is going on, Igor?!”<br>“Nofing. Just making shur dis winter vill last forever, tanks to moi ingineeus machina! Oi, I also forget! Vat could be more delightful than to get help from zeese conqererz to fulfill my dream.”<br>“It’s never gonna, pinhead! You’re goin’ down sooner or later!”<br>“You don’t even know dream!”<br>And he left, cackling piercingly as he disappeared from sight. In my resentment, I tried to bend the bars to our cell open, but was futile in my attempt. All I could do was focus my anger on the guard standing in the corridor of our cell, even though it was only a bitter stare.<br>Then...SMACK!!!...a baseball bat, sticking out of the ventilation system, knocked the guard unconscious!<br>It was the korgons! Boy, was I as glad to recognized them! Without wasting time, they jumped onto one another, forming a korgon ladder with Bob at the top — and in no time, Bob poked his tiny hands into the lock to our cell and opened it! Then the really happy news sounded:<br>“Thrust is out there dealing with the conquerors!” Amigo said.<br>I was shocked! Thrust was a born-wild wanwan, yet he had returned for me, “He’s...he’s here?”<br>“Why wouldn’t he be?”<br>After all this time of Eugene telling me that wild dinoz return to nature after a few weeks of solitude, the Professor pat me on the shoulder and with a big smile said, “I think this is the first exception ever to be recorded.”<br>Thrust obliterated his enemies that were isolated from the whole army. Some conqueror dinoz he could stalk and electrocute them from behind, but other required a little fight before he <strong>conquered</strong> them. The night-sky black gorilloz that guarded the door was one example. The gorilloz charged at the intruder from behind and opened his <em>wide jaw</em>, but Thrust’s <em>adrenaline</em> rush propelled him to make the firs assault. The gorilloz fell back and got electrified.<br>Thrust was now at the door of the laboratory.<br>I and everybody else (except Azelle) were at the other door of the same chamber.<br>Thrust entered.<br>We entered.<br>“Thrust!” I shouted across the laboratory in relief and he meowed back. The problem was: the lab was filled with conqueror dinoz...and the tubby.<br>“Vat?!” shouted Igor, “How could you escape?”<br>“It’s over,” declared Eugene, “Surrender now and calmly come with us.”<br>IGOR: “Not eef I have all zeese deenoz wiv me. Everybody, attackuite!!”<br>ME: “Thrust, sic ‘em!!”<br>And the battle commenced...<br>Not only Thrust did, but we all fought hard. My wanwan fought with great valor against the many conqueror dinoz that outnumbered him, the korgons did their best, I fought with my knife, and the rest with their fists (Joe, the retired warrior, still had his fighting skills with him). <br>It was a complete riot! Shouts and battle cries roared inside the chamber. You could see the spells of all five combat elements spraying in all directions, creating a firework effect.<br>“Tanya!” Igor shouted to a wall, which crumbled with a loud BANG at the punch of a gorilloz. He pressed a button that made Tanya intangible and continued, “Attackui!!”<br>But Thrust charged directly at her, <em>focused</em> with <em>perception</em> and knocked the gorilloz unconscious!<br><em>Perception?</em> I thought, <em>I didn’t see that one coming!</em> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink2.gif"><br>But we eventually realized that there were way too many dinoz to handle. Thrust had already received some hits and the rest of us were getting tired. The sound of Igor mockingly cackling was irritating to my ears.<br>The korgons drew back and withdrew the ‘cloudoz-in-a-jar’ from my rucksack. Amigo tried to pen it, but, “Man, these humans put the lids on so tight these days. Bob, smile.”<br>Bob displayed his teeth and allowed Amigo to use him as a can opener. As soon at the jar was open, the cloudoz steamed out into the air and fogged the lab, shooting <em>lightning</em> bolts at anything and anybody it could (which resulted in Igor’s winter machine bursting)!<br>Fortunately, it didn’t hit any one of us, so we dashed out of the lab and exited the building. A trio of conqueror dinoz surrounded us as we ran, but then Azelle, almost out of the blue, zapped them down with <em>flash wave</em>.<br>We ran away from Dinoplaza, safe and sound...<br><br>Kille finally arrived and was inside the laboratory, but was too late.<br>“What the...” he hissed silently, “What’s going on?!” But he received no answer. The scent of the nuisance, however, was fresh. He could immediately tell that it was the doing of that pest.  <br>Kille zapped the cloudoz alive! The electrolysis caused the water molecules of the cloudoz to split into separate atoms, thus killing it...<br><br><br>P.S. My wanwan, Thrust, actaully has 2 water level-ups (perception and mutation). <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/surprised.gif">

                Chapter 24: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_5.gif"> The Katatombs <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_5.gif"><br><br>As soon as we arrived at the Fountain of Youth, we hid ourselves in the hollow tree where Thrust and his team had rested in while I was in confinement (and it seemed to me that Thrust had made himself a friend — Amigo introduced me to Azelle).<br>But the thought lingered in my head of the war issue. Now that we knew the gluon was useless (I released it earlier that day), I didn’t know what we could do, but Grandfather Joe gave me instructions:<br>“You must go to the katatombs.”<br>“The kata-what?”<br>“Katatombs. It’s an ancient cemetery where the corpses of the Dinoland kings rest. Up until recently, its gates have been closed to all mortals, but now are open. Go to the katatombs and find the Demon Scroll, the manuscript containing the history of the demons. The conquerors’ power is dependent on their demons, and to destroy a demon, we must first know how it’s created.”<br>“Where do I go?”<br>“East of the Frish Port.<br>He gave me his holy symbol which he used to fight evil in his early days. After that, we headed out the next day. It was easy to find the vicinity of the katatombs, but hard to find the gateway itself. I even began to wonder whether the gateway was actually a metaphor. We searched for several hours until Thrust found it. It was a gateway, but a very unusual one. It was a door leading underground with deathly-looking hinges and a doorknob that I could try to explain to you, but I wouldn’t be accurate (something like a spike with runes, I guess, sticking out of a sculptured...thing that looked like nothing you could find on earth). Carefully, I opened it...and we entered the abyss below.<br>It was pitch black, so I took out my lighter and used it as a torch. It didn’t give us enough light to look straight ahead, but at least we could see the ground at our feet.<br>Suddenly, the gateway closed tight! And at the same time, a strange chill ran down our spines as I tried to protect the lighter fire from the winds inside. A few moments later, they stopped...<br>We listened carefully for whatever might have been in there, but the air was dead silent. So we proceeded with caution, knowing that every one second of us was precious.<br>The underground tomb was a whole labyrinth! It took us hours of searching, and some could even say wasting our time. We did not know where to go or whether we are going in circles. We even lost track of the entrance! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/eek.gif"><br>“Guys,” I said, “Bear in mind that we might not make it out of here.”<br>“How many coffins should I order?”<br>But I didn’t answer — Amigo was being the joker, anyway...again.<br>By now, it was probably night, and the fuel in my lighter was running out. but then, Amigo called out when he found a coffin of a certain king. I moved the fire near the inscription and was baffled: <em>Here lies Honorus Arkon, 147th king of Dinoland</em>. I remembered the name from Master Hydargol’s story, but Honorus was a conqueror! Why would he be king of Dinoland?<br>But then Amigo solved my confusion reading the inscriptions below, “<em>Honorus Arkon (original name Castinius Aaro) was born in Dinotown in 1945 A.D. Having ambitious dreams unaccepted to the government, he was banished for an attempted overthrow of the king. Later in his life, he joined the conquerors, seeing them as his ticket of vengeance, and upon discovering the use of dinoz, he quickly became an honored monarch of the vile army, which is the most likely reason he is known as Honorus Arkon today. After successfully overthrowing the Dinoland government, he established himself king of Dinoland and ruled it for 3 weeks, but right after his death (by poisoning), the Dinolanders raised a rebellion and won back their nation. Honorus is the last king of Dinoland. After him, the government decided to form a democracy.</em>”<br>“Nobody told me this!” I said, “He ruled Dinoland while I was a babe!”<br>“Si, it’s amazing how these things get to interact with each other...it’s just gruesome, kings die out so fast these days.”<br>We anticipated that the scroll would be in the coffin and we were right. However, the stench of the corpse in it was horrifying! So we grabbed the scroll and closed it, operating with as little time as possible.<br>But when we were about to leave, a whizzing sound of the wind sounded behind us. We stopped and looked everywhere, but there was nothing...or was there?<br>“Going somewhere?” a deathly voice sounded. I could feel the strange chill running down my pine again. From what I could tell, this was no human’s voice.<br>“Who’s there?”<br>“Me...”<br>A pair of red eyes flashed at us, lighting the whole chamber inside! We couldn’t see clearly through the light. The voice continued, “...Kille d’Arkon. You’re not going anywhere with that scroll, pest. It belongs to Lord Honorus.”<br>“Your king is dead,” I said, trying to make a bold impression.<br>“In body, yes. But he is not dead.”<br>“What are you?”<br>At that, Thrust growled and hissed and made a defensive stance, but Kille retorted, “Be quiet! No one told you to be born!”<br>“What do you mean?” I asked.<br>“I never thought my cousin would be such a nuisance.”<br>That struck a stone in my heart! I didn’t know how Thrust felt, but it must have been painful. Without my commanded, Thrust launched himself on the demon, but Kille put him under an agonizing <em>flash wave</em> curse. Azelle attacked in aid of Thrust, the chain lightning reached her as well.<br>Quickly, I took out the holy symbol from my pocket and raised it in the air — and it worked! The demon writhed in pain and shouted agonizingly. This gave time for my two wanwans (and the korgons) to counterattack. All five of them worked in a harmonized team: Thrust and Azelle tackled the demon on its side and the korgons tripped it to the ground. After that, Thrust zapped him with <em>flash wave</em>, followed by Azelle’s <em>lightning dance</em>. Amigo and Bob then threw Amigos in the air with his baseball bat; he fell on the demon’s crown (the top of the head) with a crashing blow. Kille fell unconscious...<br>Victorious, we quickly tight the demon and bound it with some chains we found in the Katatomb.<br>By the time we got out, it was morning. We were all tired, but glad to have captured the demon. Kille awoke, but was too week to break free (because I was holding the holy symbol close to him).<br>Astonishingly, after a few minutes outside the Katatombs, we found Madam X! She looked surprised to see that we had caught a demon. I took out the wanted poster that I had kept throughout our journey, handed it to her, and said, “I think this is your culprit.”<br>She took a good look at the poster and then at Kille. She nodded to us as we gave her the bound demon.<br>“Good work, but I don’t think this will clear your Thrust’s name.”<br>“What do you mean?”<br>She didn’t answer, but did the most astonishing thing that I did not see coming!<br>Click...<br>The demon was free!...<br><br>Happy reading! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                Thanks guys. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"> I'm glad you enjoy it. Here's another chapter:<br><br>Chapter 25: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_5.gif"> The Deterred Hope <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_5.gif"><br><br>Madame X had released Kille d’Arkon!<br>“See, I told you she was a spy!” Amigo shouted.<br>The demon turned around, seemingly unaffected by the holy symbol any more.<br>“My powers have outshone the symbol’s luster, fool,” he growled at me. And the next moment, he let a terrifying roar. So great was its power that it knocked us all unconscious. Everything turned black...<br><br>I woke up in a hospital bed with Thrust and Azelle right beside me and the korgons on another bed. My whole body ached and I could hardly stand on my two feet. Then a voice from the corner said, “Don’t, you still need to rest.”<br>It was Grandfather Joe.<br>“What happened?” I asked, “First, there was the demon, and now I’m here.”<br>“I saw everything. I wanted to help, but then an angry scorpscuba attacked Kille by surprise. Well, he defeated the whale, but that gave me enough time to get you here.”<br>Made sense. But the thought of the demon lingered in my mind. If I hadn’t had the holy symbol, I would’ve experienced its full rage. Furthermore, it was Thrust’s own cousin! It made me feel a little angry that such a hateful relative would exist.<br>“Joe,” I asked another question, “do you know anything about Kille d’Arkon?”<br>Grandfather Joe did not utter a word for a while. He was lost in thought after I asked him, and I regretted a bit that I did. But soon, he spoke:<br>“It’s a long story, but I do know him. Kille was a wanwan of a pride in the Magnetic Steps. Back then, he was a simple dino. His parents were killed in a fight with another pride. And so, because of that, he looked upon the world as a ‘dungeon of selfishness’ where every creature existed for its own sake. That became his ideology.<br>“Then one day, a man who wandered the lands found him and adopted him. They gradually grew close to each other because of the experiences they shared. This man, then, named his new dino Par-Sentio, because of the experiences they shared. But the wanwan did not like the name, and even though he was attached to his master, he was still a wild wanwan.<br>“Par’s master was an ambitious person. After Par had grown up, he entered the BrutForce tournament and quickly became a World Champion favorite*. With his stunning abilities, he took down his opponents without breaking a sweat. That year, he became the first ever BrutForce competitor to win all duels in a row without a single loss in the regular fights**. Outside of the ring, he had no competition, because every dino feared him.<br>“However, he didn’t become the World Champion. In the final battle, he faced a female wanwan, comely*** to his eyes. And after a very brief showdown, Par willingly stepped down and gave her the victory. Of course, his master disapproved of that and gave him a scolding, after which Par resented his master even more.<br>“Par fell in love with the championess and wanted to know her better. So they became close friends. I could imagine every bit of hatred in him melted away when he was with her. But he still sought to take revenge on life. And when his love found out who he really was inside, the two went through a painful breakup.<br>“Now Par was more hateful than ever before. He wanted to separate from his master and become one himself. The problem was that all dinoz who have gotten close to their masters have no way of separating. It’s like a subconscious religion that forbids the dino from separating even when it wants to. And for wild dinoz, like your Thrust, it may follow its primal instincts once, but if it’s reminded of its master, it’ll find him no matter what.<br>“But one night, in his dream, Par came across Honorus Arkon. Honorus said that Par would become a great leader in his army. Par, reluctant to cooperate at first, gave into the bribe of the Darkness Triad, a magical object that allowed dinoz to kill this psychological barrier and separate from their masters.<br>“But Par knew better than to separate from the beginning. You see, his master wanted Par-Sentio to become the greatest BrutForce World Champion in history. And to do that, he turned Par...into a demon.”<br>I couldn’t catch up with the old man, so I interrupted, “How did Par become a demon?”<br>“That I don’t know. But having been turned into a demon, Par used the triad and killed his master. Now he was all demonic in heart and soul...no trace of goodness was left in him. And to be known as an evil overlord-to-be, he renamed himself Kille d’Arkon, or Kill of Lord Arkon.<br>“He did go back to the BrutForce tournament, but not to become a champion, although he did. He went there to test his new powers. To do that, he morphed himself back into his original state and dueled. I watched the battle — it was...amazing, and yet terrifying... Every attack he performed was like a typhoon! He knew every elemental power of the lightning branch that has been discovered! And he did not just defeat his opponents — he finished them...<br>“Well, after that he joined the conquerors of Honorus and pledged his sincere allegiance to him. The rest you know.”<br>I needed time to take it all in. During that time, Thrust woke up, followed by Azelle. I stroke their fur as I thought. There were many things that overfilled my mind, and eventually I needed a time off of thinking.<br>“I can’t believe such evil is Thrust’s cousin,” I said.<br>“He’s not.”<br>“Huh?”<br>“The demons have their own complicated language. In fact, it’s so complicated that not even a talking demon like Kille can translate it perfectly into our own language. Cousin refers to anybody of one’s family member. However, between a brothers, sisters, spouses, or parents and children, it becomes an offensive language.”<br>“So...Kille is in truth...Thrust’s father?” I stopped stroking Thrust’s fur without noticing. Things just got from bad to worse. But Joe did not want the subject to persist any further. He promptly said:<br>“You have the scroll?” asked Joe.<br>“Oh, yea...one moment...” I searched through my rucksack, eventually scurrying through it, but... “It’s gone... What the... No, no, no! It’s gone!”<br>“What?! You lost it?!”<br>“Kille must’ve stolen it after he knocked us down. And...the holy symbol is gone too!”<br>Grandfather Joe walked to a window and sighed. I could not help but feel sorry for ruining his hope again.<br>“Then all is lost,” wise old warrior breathed, “Without the scroll, we will never know how to destroy the demons. Evil will prevail.”<br>Those were the last words that rang through my ears. A few hours later, he left the room. And I muttered to myself, “Not all is lost, not all is lost...” and I knew it was true.<br>Destroying the main camp of the conquerors would be enough to send them back where they came from. I also knew that it would only be a temporary victory, but it was better than being conquered.<br>That midnight, when all six of us had regained our strength, I told the korgons and wanwans to ready themselves for the ultimate attack:<br>ME: “Rope?”<br>AMIGO: “Check!”<br>ME: “Grenades?”<br>AMIGOS: “Check!”<br>ME: “Bob?”<br>AMIGO: “Check!”<br>ME: “Flint?”<br>AMIGOS: “Check!”<br>ME: “Knife?”<br>AZELLE: “Meow!”<br>ME: “Thrust? Ya ready?”<br>Thrust eyes glowed in lightning and his fur let loose a few sparks, the sign that he was ready.<br>And we were off!...<br><br>Favorite*--a competitor whom most people want to and believe will get to the finals of a game.<br>Regular Fights**--fights that are not the finals, semi-finals, or quarter-finals.<br>Comely***--pleasing or attractive to the eye.

                Chapter 26: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_4.gif"> Observations Before the Sunset <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_4.gif"><br><br>We made haste to reach Dinoplaza, and by the time it was the break of dawn, we had arrived. I kept in mind that we were risking our lives every second there. Luckily, the conquerors were still asleep.<br>“So, how are we going to destroy this thing?” said Amigo as we stood before the building I had been captured in.<br>I saw smoke rising from behind the building. The answer to Amigo’s question was given for me when we went to check what it was. Just as I had thought, it was a whole gear room deep in the ground. The thing was humongous! And whatever it was consuming (and producing for that matter), it was consuming a lot of it: condensed smoke was rising from the smokestacks, blackening the sky with its pollutant properties.<br>“The ultimate energy producer,” I said, “If we can destroy it, it’ll devastate the conquerors power supply.”<br>“Well what are we waiting for? Let’s do this!”<br>“Hold it,” I stopped Amigo, “After we destroy this, we have to encourage the Dinolanders to launch an assault on this area. I need all five of you to scout that building and observe everything. I’ll scout this gear pit. Report back to me once you’re done.”<br>So we split up.<br>The five, then, split into three groups: Thrust, Azelle, and the three korgons so as to cover more area in the least amount of time. The korgons scouted the individual sectors. Each sector had a different dino in it. There were gorilloz, wanwans, ferosses, pteroz, you name it (except kabukis). However, some of them were injured, and some of those injured were because of the recent attack. Injuries included fractured bones, deep cuts, concussions, and contusions (and maybe even some missing parts). Then, the korgons overheard a couple of conquerors, passing the corridor, who had gotten up early to start the day: “Listen, we can’t go on with the invasion when nearly half of our dinoz are injured,” said one.<br>“But if we don’t go on, the Dinolanders will start getting suspicious and too bold.”<br>“Either way, we must not let them know that our dinoz are unfit to fight for the moment.”<br><em>Hmm...</em> though Amigo, <em>this sounds like a party to me.</em><br>Azelle scouted the infrastructure of the building. The building was so big that it took her 20 minutes to get from one end to the other by running! From that, she could tell that the structure was a planned mall until the conquerors took it over. There were cameras all over the place, but at least the guards were asleep. Briskly, she took to searching for the monitors...and found them. But no later after she had located those rooms, the conquerors were beginning to get up from their beds. So she swiftly, but silently, ran out to scout more.<br>On several floors near the window were the heavy artilleries. Azelle suspected that those were for defending the base in case of an attack. Although her mission was just to scout, she decided to play a little trick: One by one, she sabotaged the weaponries by stealing the electrical power out of their batteries. She continued on her mission.<br>Thrust made his way through the long corridors of the would-be mall. In a few minute’s time, he had reached the only tower of the building. The tower structure was fancy and it had a ‘stylish’ façade. Some, though, may call its architects ‘sloppy’, because of its mushroom-like appearance — a mushroom with a large cap and slender stem. Thrust made his way up the elevator and reached the top of the tower. But the moment the doors opened, he his heart jumped! Right before him lay a demon glidewings: red as blood and with patagia of a devil! Thrust dared not gulp down his breath, in fear that the demon could awaken. So he slipped past the demon and decided the take the stairs. On every floor of the ‘capped’ top of the tower slept one demon each, and on some floors two or three (but in separate rooms far apart from each other). Thrust gradually grew bolder to explore further into the demons’ chambers. They were all the same: bones were littered all over the floor and dried up blood was stained on it too. Each demon’s room also had a porthole for them to jet out into action. At that, Thrust began to feel grateful that the demons did not intervene with his rescue attack. It seemed like he saw every demon the conquerors threw at Dinoland (except for those still at home), save one...his wretched father, Kille. But he did not want to stay there anymore. Thrust artfully made his way down the tower and passed unsuspecting conqueror guards.<br>As for me, I had made it to the bottom of the ledge, the foot of the machine. It took me about an hour of searching before I finally figured a way of destroying it. I took my dry Atlandeid coral flint and forced it in between two adjacent gears. The first attempt failed to show me what I wanted to see. That was the same with the other succeeding tries...until it finally showed result! When a tooth of each gear met, they rubbed themselves against the flint, which threw sparks around until a fire started. And as the gears of the machine had been oiled not too long before...the fire would be good. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/keepcool.gif"><br>We rallied up together and I got the report from everybody (Amigo translated for Thrust and Azelle).<br>Suddenly, we heard the alarm ring! Conqueror dinoz and humans were out of their beds and arming up. Things were happening too quickly — not as I had hoped! Had we had another hour at our hands, we would’ve sent a message to the Dinolanders to attack the sleeping conquerors. Now I feared that that would not come to pass, and I feared for the protection of all the citizens of Dinoland, including its defenders. And that meant one things — we were taking on the conquerors...alone!...<br><br>Voila! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                Prepare for the ultimate showdown, guys. Have fun... <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"><br><br>Chapter 27: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"> Blazing Twilight (1/4) <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"><br><br>I immediately knew that we were doing this alone. But we weren’t doing it without knowing how...<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"> There were traps set everywhere for us, even though they were not meant to be traps. The metal rail leading to the foot of the machine was one. As the water dinoz of the conquerors ran towards the fire, I commanded Thrust to electrify the rail, thus zapping down the dinoz. Then I dipped my rope into a barrel of water and tied it around the main entrance of the building before the humans could come out. As they tried to climb over the rope fence, Azelle electrocuted them. After that trap, I tied Amigos’ legs with the rope to a sculpture so that when the rope was disturbed, it would send the korgon swinging towards the unsuspecting ‘prey’. Sure enough, a ferocious gorilloz, probably the biggest and vilest of them all, came pounding the ground with every step as it ran...but into our trap. The impact swung Amigos towards the gorilloz...and bull’s-eye! He used his bat to hit the very sensitive part of the beast (I don’t know if it would be polite to tell you guys which spot that was <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif">).<br>“Hit from downtown!” paraded Amigo.<br>However, I knew that this method of combat could not last long. And I was right. As soon as the conquerors were all out of the building, they surrounded us. Among them were the fat and annoying Igor on his hover-pod and the ever so devious Madam X.<br>“You’re quite a nuisance, are ya, T200?” she uttered.<br>But for a reply, I simply said, “Shut up.”<br>“You know, I’m so glad you’re a brave lad...too brave, in fact, that you decided to take us on single-handedly. How quaint — for a hero...except that you’re not a hero.”<br>And then the final words I thought I  would ever hear sounded, “ATTACK!!!”<br>... But it wasn’t a conqueror bellowing. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/eek.gif"> It was Grandfather Joe! A whole army of Dinoland defenders and their dinoz were behind him! They struck the conquerors behind with a huge blow, sending them back towards the building.<br>“Joe?” I asked in astonishment, “You came for us?”<br>“No, we came for our nation!”<br>“But I thought you lost hope.”<br>“I have. We’re gonna die anyway, so let’s give it our best, lad! Come on!”<br>Ole Grandfather Joe could never stop inspiring me! The conquerors, however, were making a U-turn and were starting to fight back, thus the ultimate battle commenced.<br>It was an epic battle! You could easily get disoriented in the battlefield! And if you were lucky enough not to attract any attention, you could see all elemental attacks and others being performed. <em>Lightning</em> rained down from the heavens accompanied by <em>cold shower</em> and <em>mistral</em>. <em>Meteors</em> hammered down on the ground as <em>lava flow</em> turned parts of it into volcanic pools. <em>Marshes</em> were also formed, creating a chaotic harmony between fire and water. And just before you think the tables are turning, the fallen dinoz are given the <em>breath of life</em>, ensuing the battle.<br>The three korgons stood at the edge of the battlefield for a time. Finally, they decided to join in the fight.<br>“Guys, today is a good day to die,” said Amigo, “Any last words?”<br>AMIGOS: “No, I’m fine.”<br>BOB: “No.”<br>AMIGO: “Okay, ATTACK!!!”<br>“Thrust! <strong><em>Accelerate</em></strong> &amp; <strong><em>flash wave</em></strong> combo!! Azelle! <strong><em>Lightning dance!!</em></strong> Repetition!!” I commanded the wanwans.<br>It was an even battle. For as long as the demons did not appear (and I didn’t know why they didn’t) and some of the conquerors dinoz were injured, the battle would stay that way until someone gained the upper hand... And I wanted to make sure it was us!<br>I called my wanwans and korgon friends back and we (with some allied reinforcement) cut through the lines of conquerors until we got inside the building. We closed the door behind us and bound the handles together to block our enemies out.<br>“Okay, Amigo,” I said while panting, “What else did Azelle observe while scouting?”<br>“She said that there’s an underground chamber where the conquerors store some kind of machine.”<br>“Meow!” Azelle corrected him.<br>“A self-destruct machine?”<br>“You mean something to make this place blow sky high?” I inquired<br>“Yea...something like that.”<br>“Then find that machine and self-destruct the place.”<br>“Aye-aye, senor!”<br>The korgons went. At the same time, I spotted Madam X in the upper floor.<br>“After her!” I commanded the wanwans and the two defenders accompanied by their dinoz.<br>The battle ensued...

                Chapter 28 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"> Blazing Twilight (2/4) <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"><br><br>We dashed up the dysfunctional escalators, chasing after the madam. She was fast, to tell you the truth. We had a hard time catching up with her. But we finally surrounded her at a dead end.<br>Suddenly, the front door fell open — the conquerors that broke through were heading towards us in aid of Madam X.<br>“You guys, fight them off!” I commanded my comrades and the wanwans, “I can take her on.”<br>But I was underestimating the madam... I threw my first punch, but she professionally deflected it and answered with a lightning-fast counterattack! I launched a second assault, but she grabbed and threw me over her shoulder and I crash-landed next to the wall! It was apparent that she had a finesse* in waikikido! But I continued fighting...much to my misfortune, however. Her stunning moves were graceful, yet deadly. I was no master in martial arts, but I gave it my best, anyhow. I drew out my knife out and started fighting with that, but it proved to be not much help.<br>Finally, she knocked me out with a perfect roundhouse kick to the pterion** (lethal area). I fell onto the ground, dropping my knife. The pain was stinging like an abnormally large bee had stung it. All my body parts could not function. I was lying on the ground with only my eyes working as I watched Madame X walk over to the window and onto the balcony. Though I was on the ground, I could see huge artillery weapons installed onto the balcony in a row, and I was beginning to worry that she was going to use them to fire at the defenders. She loaded the barrels with lightning capsules, pressed the fire button...but nothing happened! She tried to fire them several more time before she realized that the artillery had been sabotaged.<br>“You!” Madam X turned to me, picking up my knife from the ground, “This is your doing, eh? Well, die then!”<br>She raised the blade over her head and was about to strike...when a staff, as if out of the blue, disarmed her! Guess who it was...Master Hydargol! With his <strong>supreme</strong> martial arts skills, he outmatched the madam’s prowess of waikikido and deafeted her in no more than 5 seconds! She fell from the balcony and out of sight...<br>Hydargol tapped a spot on my stomach, and immediately my nerves returned to me.<br>“Master Hydargol?” I exclaimed, “How did you get here?”<br>“By scorpscuba. Joveboze gave me his caller.”<br>“And you came here even though you are no match for the dinoz?”<br>“Wait and see,” he put his hand on my should and then led my to the roof of the building where eight other monks stood in a line. Then he continued, “We have also discovered the ways of the elements!”<br>At that, in an instant, he was blazing in fire! The other monks readied their elements, and the next thing I knew — they were bombarding the conquerors’ army with their amazing elemental skills!<br>During this time, the korgons were searching beneath the building. Most of the corridors there were dark and gloomy and they often found themselves going around in circles. However, when they started to hear footsteps of human patrolling, they knew that they weren’t far. The underground patrollers were the only conquerors who didn’t participate in the battle, because the machine was too precious to take for granted.<br>There was one patroller guarding the door, and the korgons could hear more people behind it. Once the patroller left the door, the korgons proceeded: Amigo and Amigos grabbed Bob from side to side and used him as a ram to take the door down. And after 5340 hits (@_@), they made it!...But then there was a bigger door! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/nooo.gif"><br>“Bob, you okay?” asked Amigo.<br>“Si-i...” he replied and fainted.<br>“I think we should give him a rest,” requested Amigos. But how were they going to open the door? The answer smacked them in their faces:<br>Boom! “Ow!” The patroller was on the ground, bound in ropes, in front of them. The cause: it was Dian Korgsey and the trio’s fellow korgons!<br>“Miss Korgsey? Wow!” Amigo fell in awe, “What brings you here? I thought you were mad at us.”<br>“I was, but then Grandfather Joe told me the reason you had to leave. So now I’m here.”<br>“But what about the Gate Guardians?”<br>“We’ll tell you later. Now, it sounded like you need a ram?...”<br>Boom! The door fell open like the former, and the patroller (whom they used as a ram) — unconscious.<br>The korgons and Dian snuck inaudibly past the hall before hiding behind a corner. Two guards, with no dinoz, were at the entrance to the machine.<br>“Okay,” announced Amigo, “On my mark, we attack those guards.”<br>But before he could say ‘go’, Bob woke up, saw the two conquerors, and launched a premature attack, yelling like a caffeine-dosed macaw. The guard, whose leg Bob was futilely punching, picked him up in his hand.<br>“Awww, look at the little guy!” he said (the guards couldn’t see the korgons around the corner).<br>“Put him down. We’re on duty.”<br>“Oh come on, who could interrupt us down here? Tell me what you know about korgons.”<br>The second guard hesitated a bit, but then told him a small fact, “You saw how he’s struggling to bash your leg?”<br>“Duh.”<br>“That’s why they only attack in groups...”<br>(Wait for it...) BASH!!! They all attacked!<br>Guards aside, they entered through the door...<br><br>Finesse*--excelent skill; artfulness; craft; cunning.<br>Pterion**--the soft part of the head, located on both sides of it, next to your eyes and above your ears.<br><br>I guess you guys already know what I mean by 'twilight' in the chapter topic.

                Chapter 29: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"> Blazing Twilight (3/4) <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"><br><br>The monks fought valiantly, and I fought alongside them with Thrust and Azelle at my side. It occurred to me...we were winning! I couldn’t believe it!<br>But then, I saw my shadow in front of me surrounded by crimson light. I knew it — the demons! The monks turned their heads to look at what was behind their backs, but a second later, we were blown off the roof! Master Hydargol managed to catch me and land on his feet, but the other monks were less skillful in doing that. Some fell on their backs or sides and a few bones were broken from the impact.<br>Then, a familiar voice shouted through the battlefield, ceasing the fight, “I was expecting you!” said the dreaded one — Kille — and a whole horde of demons were behind him.<br>“I thought you’d come, Hydargol,” he continued, “thanks to your blabbermouth kid here.”<br>The young apprentice monk struggled in the demon’s grip — he was hanging onto dear life from the ground 80 feet below.<br>“Cease the fighting, and the kid will survive,” Kille snarled.<br>A monk tried to throw a fireball, but Hydargol stopped him, saying, “Don’t! He’ll kill the child!”<br>The lion-size demon, Kille, let loose a small cackle before summoning the fire demons into action. Demon moueffes, softpigs, and pteroz stood at the front of the building and created a wall of fire that slowly closed in on us.<br>We couldn’t move a muscle, because our motivation for this victory was too great to let slip away. We were already very close to winning this, we couldn’t give up now!...<br><br>But meanwhile the korgons were inside the room of the machine they were looking for. The problem was, out the millions of buttons on it, they didn’t know which one was the right one. There was a simple solution to it, though: Amigo grabbed Bob by the legs and smacked him everywhere on the broad keyboard. And guess what — it worked!<br>“<em>Warning! Warning! Self-destruct in 10 minutes!</em>” the alarm sounded.<br>“Ten minutes?! Why not ten seconds, for crying out loud?!” Amigo shouted angrily, but then Amigos whispered into his ear to explain why.<br>“Oh...good point,” Amigo blushed over his mistake <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/redface.gif">, “Let’s get out of here!”<br><br>The wall of fire was getting too close. I could feel the intense heat upon my face and hands.<br>Suddenly, an explosion came from behind the demons and the wall of fire cease! It was the energy producer that I had lit with the flint — all that remained was an inferno devouring the broken parts of the machinery.<br>Kille growled at the loss and threw the apprentice off the roof. But luckily, Hydargol was fast enough to run and catch the child.<br>Then, the second explosion erupted — the building itself! The timer in the self-destruction machine had reached 0 and sent the structure flying sky-high along with the demons!<br>Kille survived...but when he looked all around him, in the rubble and fire that was left, all the demons...had died!<br> “RRRAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”  he roared at the top of his voice.<br>Along with him, four other demons had survived: a softpig, a gorilloz, a sirain, and a santaz. Tremendously angered for the <strong>huge</strong> loss, they charged at us at full force. We tried to counterattack, but the power of just five demons was enough to fell more than the size of our army! We had to retreat!<br>Now we were running back through the forest whilst being chased by the demons. Most of us did not survive. The speed of the demons was too great to outrun. And with Kille felling the most dinoz and humans out of the five, there was no way even one of us would make it back to Dinotown alive!<br>As everybody ran for their lives, I and Thrust hid ourselves under a thicket for a temporary cover. And as if by instinct, I was giving Thrust the very command I never thought I‘d give him:<br>“Thrust! <em><strong>Primal state!!</strong></em>”<br>The wanwan gave me a peculiar look, but I was very sure about what I was saying, “Do it!”<br>And so, Thrust closed his eyes and listened to the voices surrounding his head. He started interacting with them, and a moment later...his fur was conducting electricity like I had never seen him before! His eyes became yellowish and intimidating and the tone of his growl was nothing less than violent! However, he did not let the internal voice overtake him completely — he was still my wanwan!<br>“Now sic ‘em!”<br><br>The demon softpig scanned the area for us. It just started looking in the thickets when, to its misfortune, Thrust sprang at it and electrified the demon mercilessly until he put the softpig’s suffering to an end! Three other demons heard the commotion and rushed to the rescue, but were too late. And when they got to the ambush site, Thrust attacked them too. The fight with the three was extreme! The demons’ powers were unmatchable to any dino, but Thrust in his <em>primal state</em> could outmatch that! He tackled the santaz hard in the neck, <em>focused</em> on the gorilloz with <em>accleleration</em>, and harassed the sirain with a series of multi-hits. After that, the fight prolonged — but the demons, even though managed to score a few hits, were no match to Thrust! Finally, he zapped them down with <em>flash wave</em>. They fell dead on the ground, leaving Kille the only surviving demon.<br>Having sensed the peril befallen on his companions, Kille stopped chasing after the fleeing defenders and turned around to face his very son...and enemy. They were now facing each other: father and son in a fatal duel.<br>“You’re more of a nuisance than I thought, cousin,” snarled Kille.<br>“Where’s the scroll, Kille?” Thrust snarled back.<br>“You won’t find any use with the information if I divulge it. After I’m done with you, there will be no one to protect Dinoland.”<br>“You conquerors all want to claim Dinoland as your own. If that’s your goal, why kill its citizens?”<br>“You don’t know us. If we can’t possess Dinoland, then we will vow...to <strong>destroy it</strong>!”<br>At that, Thrust’s rage was beyond his control. Kille, however, attacked first, but the intuitive Thrust leaped over the demon and harassed him with continuous <em>accelerated</em> multi-hits. Kille, after the oppression of the attacks, regained his orientation and started <em>accelerating</em> throughout the forest. Thrust <em>accelerated</em> as well; they created a deadly ballet between two powerhouses of speed and lightning. Every one of their electric attacks missed its target. Even the dead-accurate <em>lighting</em> bolts of Kille missed Thrust every time. The same went with Thrust’s <em>flash waves</em>: every discharge created a chain lightning that stretched from tree to tree, but he could not extend it long enough to the super-swift demon.<br>They fought in this fashion for a while until they made it back to Dinoplaza, when Thrust <em>perceived</em> the direction Kille was <em>accelerating</em> to and tackled him there. The demon landed on his side next to the ditch where the energy producer used to be. The inferno was still going, and it rhymed perfectly with Thrust’s boiling anger. Every part of him wanted to kill his evil father and then destroy his empty body to shreds...But d’Arkon had other plans...<br>When Thrust approached the lying body of the demon, he was suddenly blown backwards! Looking up, it was Kille. And this time, he was in his <em>primal state</em>! Thrust could not believe his eyes! And before he could even complete a blink, Kille <em>accelerated</em> into him and tackled him as hard as nothing he could imagine! There was nothing my wanwan could do! D’Arkon was too fast; too powerful! He smashed Thrust on the ground, on trees, on building walls, and etc. The demon’s enormous fists locked around Thrust neck and squeezed it slowly, punching the air out of his son, before smashing him onto the ground again!<br>Thrust, semiconscious on the gorund, battered and bleeding, was too tired to move a muscle. There was a moment of pause in the fight between him and Kille d’Arkon. He could still feel the heat from the nearby inferno, however, and then drops of rain splashed down on his face. He could see a crowd gathering around him and Kille, as the light shower turned to a downpour. I was in the crowd along with the korgons, Azelle, Dian, Grandfather Joe, Professor Eugene, Nicolas Mulot, the monks, Joveboze, and a few survivors. Even our enemies joined us to witness the fight: Professor Igor, the admiral, the aerial commander, the commander-in-chief, and their survivors.<br>“You Dinolanders have been nothing but trouble!” exclaimed Kille, “These lands belong to us. And any one of you ho dare challenge me like my fool-hearted son, this is what you get!”<br>The lion-sized demon turned to Thrust, who was struggling to keep his balance when he stood up. Bob ran to Thrust’s side, not wanting to see his dear friend go without a companion. Kille triggered <em>focus</em> to finish his son off: his fur gained glow until the point were he was radiating in yellow light. Thrust knew it: this was his final chapter. He thought of all the people and dinoz he loved, fixed his gave upon me, the korgons, and lastly Azelle, and felt the grip of Bob’s tiny hands around him. He closed his eyes so as not to see the end coming...<br>The first spark of lightning spurted out of Kille’s fur...but as soon as it did, the spark backfired at the demon! From that spark, a whole net of electricity was formed, zapping the demon as he roared in agonizing pain! The next moment...it was all over!<br>The rain was undoubtedly the cause of the backfire. Kille had overlooked that fact for being too obsessed with bringing Thrust’s end. What was more, he was standing at the edge of the inferno ditch. The soil beneath his hefty weight was giving way — he was about to fall into the fiery abyss below.<br>But before he did, in his last dying motion, he suddenly snatched Thrust with his teeth and pulled him and Bob down!<br>As soon as we saw that in action, I and Azelle ran to save Thrust...but we were too late. And although Bob had tugged onto him to prevent him from falling, he too was taken down.<br>“THRUUUUUUUUSSSST!!!!!!!!!!” I yelled as I watched the very wanwan I had raised and nurtured fall to his death.<br>My shout, it seemed, would be the last human voice that would every matter to me...<br><br>Enjoy, guys!

                Chapter 30: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"> Blazing Twilight (4/4) <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"><br><br>The sirens of fire engines roared through the air, but I could not hear them. I could not even feel the tear trickling down my cheek as I watched the fire blazing in the abyss. My only hope was that Thrust would survive...but that hope was fragile...<br>“Don’t worry, son,” said a firefighter, “We’ll get him out of there.”<br>And so I gave him my trust; it was the only thing I could do...<br><br>Thrust slowly got up on his four feet, limping as he tried to take a few steps to check whether he was still alive. Sure enough, he was, but only just. The dense smoke of the fire limited his visibility to almost nothing, but he could still see the body of Kille d’Arkon lying not to far from him — dead. Bob lie right next to Thrust, but was unconscious from the impact.<br>Despite the sharp pain that cursed his side and leg, Thrust knew that they had to get out of the inferno. He took Bob with his paw and mounted him on his back, then proceeded slowly to a random direction.<br>However, the smoke was too dense. Thrust couldn’t even breathe properly, let alone sniff the air to find his way. He struggled to find some pockets of good air in the midst of the fog, but then realized he was wasting his time doing so. And so, he just pressed forward, coughing along the way.<br><br>The rescuers found the entrance into the inferno, but couldn’t proceed deeper into it: a gear engulfed in flames fell right in front of them, blocking the entrance. The firefighters had to extinguish the flames, but it was taking too long.<br>Azelle stayed aboveground right above the entrance and called out, “Thrust! Thrust! Over here!” in hopes that Thrust would steer his course towards her voice. Amigo and Amigos followed suit. They cried out continuously for the two stranded in the abyss.<br>Although I could not understand Azelle, I was sure she was calling out to him, and I did the same along with everybody else.<br>By now, it was late in the evening. The rain was still going, but it could only quench the flames a little bit.<br>“Sir,” I asked the firefighter, “Will he still make it?”<br>The expression was his face was all but confident. I could tell immediately that Thrust’s survival was a questionable issue. I took that as an answer and started cursing myself. <em>How could I allow such a thing happen to Thrust?! Please live, Thrust! Please!</em><br>“Oh Thrust...” Azelle sighed. Her jaw ached until she couldn’t shout anymore. After a brief rest, she continued to shout out, forcing herself...<br><br>Thrust couldn’t take it any longer. The heavy smoke was beating him down and he was beaten down. Carefully, he sat down and rested his head.<br><em>This really is my last chapter</em>, he thought to himself, <em>I guess my time has come to pass.</em><br>Then, he looked at the unconscious Bob and realized that he couldn’t take the korgon with him to the next world just like that. He had to press forward, at least to allow the korgon to live. But now he was too weak to even get up!<br>But then, he heard the voice of Azelle meowing, “Thrust! Over here! Thrust!”<br>This gave him a new energy to press forward! He conquered his weakness, forced himself to get up, and carried Bob in his mouth as he went towards Azelle’s voice. All of a sudden, he was thinking to himself, <em>I can make it! Must make it! We will survive!</em><br>But then a portion from the burning machine fell from above them, surrounding them and blocking their way with fire and more smoke.<br>Now it really did seem like the end, but there still was something he could do: Putting Bob on the ground, he erected his legs and back, triggered <em>focus</em> to glow his fur in yellow light...and then collapsed.<br><br>I saw the yellowish glow amidst the smoke, immediately recognizing it as Thrust. At that instant, I rushed down to the entrance and ran past the flaming blockage that the firefighters dared not pass through!<br>“Kid! What’re you doing?!” the firefighter shouted to call me back, but to no avail.<br>I rushed past the smoke and flames, covering my mouth and hoping that I would have enough air to retrieve Thrust. But thanks to the temporal light he gave me, I could find him easily. I grabbed onto the unconscious Thrust and Bob and then raced back, using Azelle’s meows to find my way.<br>“There they are!” another firefighter shouted upon spotting us, “Give them some way!”<br>They started spraying water on the flames that were in front of us. I could see clearly the way out and I began crying tears of joy, for all those dear to me were going to be alive and well!<br>Suddenly, the archway to the entrance collapsed as we were running through it!<br>The firefighters, Azelle, the korgons and the whole crowd watch in anxiety as the smoke coated us from their vision. It was uncertain to them whether the archway had fallen on top of us, or we had survived...<br>...But then...we emerged out of the smoke! Like a tidal wave, we were met with embraces from people and dinoz alike. Thrust, regaining his consciousness, was hugged and even squeezed by Azelle and the two korgons out of their love for him. We could hear shouts of joy and tears forming on everybody’s eyes! This, I thought, was truly a heaven unmatchable by any paradise in the world!<br><br>---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- ----------------------<br><br>The firefighters had defeated the flames soon afterward. We were sent to the hospital and treated like heroes. And with the conqueror’s main camp destroyed, an unusual sense of relaxation spread through my veins. I could tell that it was the same with Thrust, Azelle, and the korgons, as they huddled up together into one cluster.<br>Finally, after our great adventure, toils, and tribulations, we could finally rest in peace...and a warm bed...<br><br>Final chapter next week! Enjoy!

                Final Chapter (special thanks to Killer60 &amp; Fangstriker)<br><br>It was a beautiful late afternoon in the autumn time. I and Thrust gazed upon the setting sun reaching its zenith in the horizon. You could almost imagine that in such a precious moment you were being watched and protected by someone out there. I could imagine the pinkish façade of setting sun to be the face of that protector who kept us alive during or adventure.<br>“Hey! What’re you out here for?” a friend of mine shouted from behind, “We’re late for the ceremony!”<br>And so, we dashed into the Dinotown palace (Dinotwon was reconstructed) and arrived at the ceremony. And just in time too! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br>“Your attention please, ladies and gentlemen,” the announcer spoke, “Thank you. Firstly, I would like to thank you all for coming here to congratulate our three newest national heroes whom we will nominate on this very special occasion. National heroes, I will call out your names and you may come up to the stage to receive your title.<br>“The first is Fangstriker and his ever so loyal Fricaya!”<br>The room burst in applause as the two made their way to the stage and each received a medal promoting them to that rank (Fricaya performed a summersault out of joy).<br>“Our second national hero is the youthful, yet noble Welceon!<br>Another round of applause burst from the audience as Welceon made it to the stage and received his medal.<br>“And last but not least, it is...uh...anonymous?” (The crowd laughed a bit) The announcer himself let loose a small giggle before continuing, “It’s Thrust and his master!”<br>Another round of applause sounded through the air as w made our way to the stage. I blushed at seeing all the people looking up at us from their seats, and so I kept my chin low all the way to the stage.<br>“How shall I call you?” the announcer asked me.<br>“Just call me ‘T’.”<br>“Alright. Last but not least, we would like to nominate T and his trusty Thrust as a national hero of Dinoland along with the former two! Let’s give it up, everybody!”<br>We were presented with a medal each, on which was written, “National Hero of Dinoland.”<br>After receiving our rewards, we sat back down at our seats as the announcer gave some final words and then closed his speech.<br>After that, the tables in the room with filled with platters of snacks and jugs of beverages. I saw Thrust, Azelle, Welceon, Leafblaze, and Fricaya in a group talking together. It was truly touching to me to see them in a friendly discussion, sharing testimonies of their adventures.<br>Fangstriker and I introduced ourselves to each other and realized that we were students of the same university! We also realized that our rooms were contiguous to each other! His room was 369 and mine was 370! What a coincidence!<br>On the other side of the room, a kid wanted to buy Bob from the korgons, but they kept refusing:<br>KID: “I’ll give you 10 sterrals.”<br>AMIGO: “No.”<br>KID: “I’ll give you 20.”<br>AMIGO: “No.”<br>KID: “I’ll give you everything I have!”<br>AMIGO: “No, because to us Bob is everything!”<br>AMIGOS (sobbing): “That’s so touching!”<br><br>All in all, this is the conclusion: Our attack on the conquerors was not the only one that caused them to retreat. There were other major attacks that devastated their plans to rule Dinoland. The conquerors retreated back to their safe haven, wherever it was. The blow they had received was so great that it would take some time for them to recover. By the time they would be ready to attack again, we would have been ready more than every before.<br>Dinoland was restored and Dinoplaza was reconstructed. The mall that was taken by the conquerors was reconstructed and made bigger than ever! They opened it to the public soon after its completion. I and Thrust have been there several times. And believe me, it was a shopper’s paradise! Though I’m not a shopping fanatic, I couldn’t resist buying some things there, including a new cell phone and a collar with a built-in walkie-talkie for Thrust. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"><br>I returned back to the University to continue my studies. My grades have improved tremendously due to the experience I had gained in the adventure. Getting an A+ was a lot easier than was it was before all this started.<br>But the most important thing for me was the peace that Dinoland was in now. The tribulations I had gone through helped me appreciate this priceless time more. And that is, what I call, a happy conclusion...<br><br>The three korgons climbed up a tree and watched the peaceful valley of Dinoland from atop it. But Amigo was not pleased:<br>AMIGO: “This was supposed to be a happy ending!!”<br><br>THE END<br><br>That's all, folks! I hope you all enjoyed Thrust's Tale! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"> Stay tuned for the Christmas Special that I and Killer60 are working on!

                Here are the first 9 chapters that have not been posted on this thread:<br><br>Chapter 1:  The Stray Wanwan <br><br>It was some time ago in a town that was the Capital of the land, Dinotown. There I was, in the busy streets of the town and was buying some meat from the butcher's.<br>As I headed for home, I stopped while walking past an alley where a group of stray wanwans scavenged in the garbage for food. I was fond of wanwans, so I stopped for a moment to watch them. Then, something caught my eye...<br>As the group made its way out of the alley into the streets, I saw a yellow baby wanwan, about 2 weeks old, trying to climb into the trash container. But no matter how hard it tried, it was just too young to make it up there and instead fumbled onto the ground clumsily. The adults seemed not to care at all as it meowed, probably crying...I felt pity towards the little critter.<br>I approached the wanwan, about to reach my hand to it, when it took a defensive stance and growled unwelcomingly. Its instincts were probably saying that I was danger . So I threw a piece of meat I bought on the ground and took a few steps backwards.<br>Confused, it looked at the meat, then at me, then at the meat again and cautiously approached it. As if it never saw a chunk of meat before, it slightly touched the food and jumped backwards at that instant. It did that a second time before it felt no danger and lunged itself for the meat and thrust its little teeth into the meal.<br>I could not help but laugh at the sight of a baby wanwan clumsily trying to tear a morsel from the steak. That's when I decided to give it a name. Because he was thrusting his teeth into its given meal, I called him Thrust...<br><br><br>Chapter 2:  The Lightning Dino <br><br>Thrust was too cute to leave him to fend for himself. I had to adopt him, but I also had to be careful about his electricity-conducting fur.<br>I took off my jacket and carefully timed the moment to approach. Luckily, it was too distracted by the meat, so I seized the opportunity and threw the jacket of the wanwan. Then I plunged on top of him and wrestled a little. For a baby, Thrust packed quite a punch (I accidentally touched his fur).<br>"Ouch!" I yelped in feeling the electrical punch on my hand, but I won in the end.<br>From there, I traveled to the University, where I was a student, and got to my dormitory. Thrust was calmer, now that I showed I meant no harm, but I was sure he didn’t me, either .<br>Eventually, I took him to my dinoologist professor, Eugene, and bragged a little about adorable the wanwan and its  skills.<br>"And...you caught this baby wanwan in the alley?" Eugene questioned me rather skeptically.<br>"It was the only wanwan in the sight...after the adults left anyway...I just had to adopt him, see."<br>"You might want to be careful. Wanwans born in the wild tend to give their captors a hard time. That's why dino masters prefer adopting wanwans that are born in captivity. Wanwans are wild animals by nature and it could take years to domesticate them. And even when they are domesticated, once they are released, it only takes them a few weeks to revert back to their primal state."<br>"I'm sure I can pull it off." I bragged confidently.<br>"I hope you're right. Dino World War 1 was the cause of the wanwans losing their masters. That was the reason for the sudden burst of wild wanwan population. It's threatening farmlands and agriculture, apart from wolves and smashrooms."<br>A sudden shadow fell upon my spirit. Even though I was only a toddler during DWW1, the event has left a scar in my memory. Many seers were telling of DWW2 to come very soon. Just thinking of that made me want to throw up.<br>I looked out the window into the valley and Perspicuous Hills. The second was fast approaching -- conquerors mastering demon dinos were on the ready for their second assault on Dinoland, a fire ready to consume and satisfy its impossible appetite.<br>At the brink of midnight, I crept out, with Thrust, and made the run for it...<br><br><br>Chapter 3:  The War <br><br>3 years later...<br><br>"Ready the fire balls! Fire!!!" hollered the conqueror general at his softpigs.<br>It was the 2nd war. Villages were being leveled, families separated, even lives lost...<br>By now, Thrust had become almost a fully grown dino and had learned the skill focus. Alongside us were three travelling korgons, Amigo, Amigos, and Bob (they all had Spanish accents). Sadly, they came to the wrong place at the wrong time.  <br>"Amigo, I told you not to go on vacation!" Amigo argued as the three trailed after us towards Dinotown.<br>"Si, si, and stay home with Miss Korgsey. Better be man-chow than Korgsey-chow!"<br>"Shush!" I silenced the argument as we ran forward.<br>The sky was blocked by clouds of soot and a blazing furnace could be seen in the horizon. We stopped and ducked behind a rock at the edge of Dinotown and saw dino defenders of all races fighting off the more powerful dino conquerors.<br>"So, smarty-pants," Amigo turned to me, "what's the plan?"<br>But I had no plan...All I could tell was Thrust struggling to keep himself from plunging into action without my order.<br>"Oh, no plan? Good plan! No plan is good plan. Is that right, Bob?"<br>Bob nodded ferociously and laughed awkwardly like he had just had five glasses of beer.<br>"Sorry, man, he's a little koo-koo in the head (sighing), but still family..."<br>I paid no attention but spotted an abandoned family being cornered by a large moueffe.<br>"Thrust! Focus!"<br>At that, the wanwan's fur grew brighter until Thrust was a ball of lightning that charged at the moueffe and hit it hard on the head. The korgons followed suit, except that they used mockery as their weapon, jeering at the fallen moueffe as it struggled under the  of Thrust.<br>I had Thrust fight as much as I could allow him until the five of us finally had to fall back. The attackers were now outnumbered as the defenders grouped up. Wanwans, winks, glidewings, and rockies gathered in one spot and...<br>A defending master roared, "Lighting!!!" and jets of bolts flashed down angrily on the enemy. Victory was favoring our side, but not for long...<br>Suddenly, a huge pillar of fire broke through the clouds above and restricted the lightning bolts. Its power was so great that I could feel the heat from a large distance. It was a demon softpig, its burning eyes lighting in the night in ruby. And behind it a hoard of demons growled and snarled as they covered the horizon.<br>I had no choice but to flee, taking Thrust and the three korgons along with me and dashed as fast as I could so as not to hear the sound of devastation behind me.<br>There was now only once hope in winning this war to reestablish peace. The only light that poked the darkness was in a hut past the University and at the foot of Big All-Hot. The former warrior, Grandfather Joe...<br><br><br>Chapter 4:  The Retired Warrior <br><br>We were making our way north, waking up early every morning so as to stretch the distance between us and the now metropolis ruins. We passed by the University. Thankfully, it was still standing and completely unharmed. But when I went inside to check, no one was present. Sheets of paper and notebooks were scattered all over the floor in Eugene's room. Evidently, he had escaped. All I could see was a rucksack, a buoy, a coil of rope.<br>Those I took: I stuffed the buoy in the rucksack, wrapped the rope around my shoulder, and proceeded to the next cabin.<br>This was Professor Igor's cabin. There was nothing much I could find of use in the wilderness, but I did find a knife and a pair of leather gloves which I collected, and then exited out the University.<br>As we walked northwards, it came into thought about Igor. He wasn't a bad teacher. In fact, he was elected "The Professor of the Year" by the University students. But he had an obsession for this place called Totem Island, whatever it was. He had posters of that place all over his wall with a weird-looking creature posing a ninja stance.  For that I thought he was a little weird.<br>It drove me crazy, sometimes, hearing the korgons blabbering about their "vacation":<br>"I always said, 'Bad idea, Amigo.' We should not ha' gone on vacation. But nooooo, you 'won a trip to Dinoland'!"<br>"Shut up!"<br>And another thing was Thrust. Although I had made it clear to him that I was his master, he still did not favor me that much. Eugene was right, wanwan born in the wild are very hard to tame...completely.<br>Just when I thought we were lost, we came across a shabby old hut and heard an ancient voice singling the old songs grandpa used to like. Sure enough, it was Grandfather Joe.<br>I did not know how to greet myself in front of him, but then Bob quickly yelled, "Hola!" and blew our cover (it was the first time I heard his voice; rather squeaky, I should say).<br>"Hey, my boys!" he approached us with open arms (although I would have gladly offered him a stick, if you know what I mean), "Welcome to my house! Is this your first time in Dinotown?"<br>"No." I replied.<br>"Are you sure? You could be with all that travelling equipment."<br>I tried to give a small laugh, but found it hard to do. Either way, the old man invited us warmly to his house and gave me a cup of tea, smaller cups for the korgons, and a portion of his sausages to Thrust with a bowl of water. Thrust seemed to show his liking for the old man from the start and purred whenever Joe stroked the wanwan's back. I asked him what his secret was. He answered, "If you treat him with love and compassion, he will naturally give in to you. Treat him otherwise, and he will never forgive you."<br>"Good tip." I thought, but I didn't know if I could bring myself to love. It just didn't feel to manly for me.<br>To waver myself from the love topic, I asked the serious question: "Grandfather, have you heard about the world?"<br>It looked as though his heart had stopped. With shaking hands, he put his cup back on its saucer and thought for a few moments.<br>"The demons are back?"<br>I nodded.<br>"The conquerors have still not had enough. They will stop at nothing to take dominion over these lands."<br>"What happened in the last war?"<br>"We had to call for all the help we could get. We've summoned Bao Bob of the seas, the water and fire elementals of the University, and even asked for help from the Venerable, agreeing to pay him a monthly tribute of food for his service, which lead to mass starvation.<br>"We won at the end, but at the cost of a national financial meltdown. We can't afford to do that again."<br>But I spotted that he feared another thing: "Is there something else?"<br>"Yes, seers have rumored of demon that stand above all the other demons in power. They say he would lead them to victory in conquering Dinoland that they had failed previously."<br>"But there has to be something we can do. I mean there's still a chance we could win."<br>That was a stupid question. I wanted to bonk my own head for that, but surprisingly Grandfather Joe showed a lift of spirit.<br>"There is a way. But you have to do me a little favor."<br>"I'm listening."<br>"Find me a gluon?"<br>"Gluon?"<br>"It's a shape shifter. People have rarely seen them because of that ability. But if you find it, it will look like a greenish, shapeless life form. Here...I have picture."<br>He retrieved a photo of the most unearthly creature I've ever seen. Even Amigo exclaimed, "That? It looks like the stuff that came out of the sphinx's nose!"<br>"You will have to contain it in this jar," Joe continued, handing me a pair of jars that I stuffed into my rucksack. Then, out of the shadows, a glidewings came out. Joe tied a small parchment to it containing a message he wrote to a professor in a distant land.<br>"I don't feel right doing this. The conquerors will want to take caution of all the postages come to and from Dinoland. They'll try to intercept anything they find. But in any case, if you find the gluon, go to Grumhel Forest and find a man named Nicolas Mulot. Give him a sample of the gluon and then bring the results to the shaman and elementary teacher at the Lavapit of the Big All-Hot. I will send Skora, here, with the message to Nicolas to expect you."<br>I nodded duly, and then the five of us departed. I waved my hand to him as he hollered, "Good luck, traveler!"<br>And so, our adventure began...<br><br><br>Chapter 5:  Strange Coincidences <br><br>Skora the Glidewings soared over the forest of Dinoland. The coast was visible in the horizon and she new which way to head.<br>Suddenly, something struck her from bellow, something large and powerful, and ripped her patagium (the "wings" of bats and flying squirrels). It was a pteroz...<br>The beast encircled poor Skora as she fell helplessly towards the ground...and crashed dead. To this, the pteroz loosened the note from Skora's dad body and took off as soon as its mission was accomplished...<br><br>---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- ----------------------<br><br>We headed southward for the Fish Port (I don't know why they called it a Frish Port; I think it should be Fish Port) in hopes of finding the ever rare gluon along the way. But my water container was empty and the three korgons would never stop complaining (and, man, were they experts at that  ).<br>It felt like Eden when we came upon the Fountain of Youth. We raced up to it, caring only about the goodness of water, and not who were we shoving out of our way. However...<br>"YUCK!!!" I gasped when the fountain's water touched my tongue. The rest reacted accordingly and spat it out. How could such water be saltier than the ocean?<br>"Tastes like roncivore pee!" complained Amigo, but Amigos retaliated:<br>"Roncivores don't pee."<br>Thrust disliked it no less than I did, seeing him rubbing his tongue on his shoulder in disgust. The water was not fit to drink and there was no way I could filter it. Things felt down to us all, even the hovering rock over the water seemed dull without drinkable water.<br>But just then, I saw something shifting in the water. As I leaned forward, I perceived its greenish appearance...and then a form: I could tell, as I was moving towards me. Then, an emerald, smooth surface jutted out of the water...and a pair of eyes popped out! I jumped back from the shock, but then realized that it was what we were looking for.<br>"Thrust," I whispered, "Electrify the water."<br>But he hesitated. It irritated me: Thrust was taking too long to obey my order. And by the time he made an attempt, the gluon attacked!<br>Thrust fell backwards as the gluon advanced, giving no room for my wanwan to retort!<br>"Guys! We've got to help!"<br>"No worries," said Amigo, "We've got ze universal weapon."<br>The gluon kept pressing Thrust backwards, until he was right in front of a tree. About to deliver the crushing blow, Bob crashed into the slimy creature (he was hurled as a dodge ball).<br>Angered, it turned on at Bob and swalloed him like an amoeba, but it gave Thrust the slack to charge in.<br>I yelled, "Focus!!", and he knocked Bob our of a gooey death...only to get enraptured himself. Now I was really afraid. The wanwan I had raised for the past three years was under death's mercy: The gluon was absorbing his energy, sucking him dry.<br>Before I knew it, all four of us plunged onto the formless creature, but its unheard strength threw us aside and bruised my abdomen.<br>But strangely, we were winning...Thrust was, out of no perceptible reason, was illuminating within the gluon. As soon as his light almost matched the sun's he escaped with a lightning fast jolt, reaching incredible speeds and harassing the gluon.<br>I seized the opportunity, and sealed the gluon inside the jar. But what fascinated me more was the new skill Thrust had learned. It seemed as though he had learned accelerate, an ability that allows for hypersonic speed (and something I made up). I could tell my wanwan was content with its day's work: it meowed proudly with its head stuck to the sky.<br>The korgons applauded and even I didn't bother to clap, but I wasn't the only human clapping.<br>"Nice, man. Who couldn't do better?" a familiar voice taunted from behind.. Sure enough, it was my former friend, Benroy. Former since he joined the conquerors to save his own neck.<br>"Long time no see," I taunted back, but with more hatred in my voice. I could not stand the sight of him and his dreaded pteroz, especially when he was mounted on it to pose a brave knight...yea, right.<br>"Is my little buddy still a being patriot?"<br>"Is the jerk a traitor?"<br>"Now, now, what did your mommy tell you about calling names? And what are those three dogs doing with you? They look like steak to me!"<br>"Hey, hey, kido!" Amigo growled, "I know, we korgons may not be much of a match! But let me tell you, korons are ze most ancient intelligent creatures of all times. Thus, I have proven to you that korgons are very and will forever be edible creatures!!!"<br>Amigos whispered into his ear.<br>"Endurable... "<br>"Enough chit-chat! What are you here for?" I continued.<br>"Oh, just to see how you're doin'. You know, wish ya misfortune, the worst of luck, and break a leg, if you know what I mean."<br>"Guys, ignore him." And we started to walk away.<br>"I wouldn't do that if I were you."<br>"Ignore."<br>"I have a message for you."<br>I stopped. I knew it from those words immediately. He had intercepted the parchment of Joe.<br>I knelt down to the wanwan's side, still pretending that I did not pay attention, and whispered, "Thrust, Accelerate."<br>But Benroy did realize that I was at him: as quick as he could command his pteroz, the two took to the air, but Thrust's new skill rammed Benroy off his steed and onto the ground.<br>"Good job, boy! Retrieve the parchment!"<br>But he had no parchment. It was in the pteorz, as he indicated, trying to look innocent.<br>"I'll deal with you later." I sneered, and took off after the pteroz with the rest...<br><br>To be continued...<br><br><br>Chapter6:  Wanted <br><br>Benroy's pteroz was too fast and had more space in the air. Even when Thrust accelerated to match the beast's speed, when we reached Thrust, he was clueless and sniffing the air, but found nothing.<br>I breathed out depressingly. I should've persuaded old Joe not to send his glidewings, and now she was dead.<br>"Well this sucks!" Amigo shouted at the top of his voice.<br>"You suck!" Amigos accused, and the two korgons broke into an argument. This time, even Thrust seemed to join in, seemingly feeling as down and angry as they were. Only Bob was the one with the smiley face. I couldn't take any of this any longer:<br>"Quiet!!!"<br>The lot ceased and fell dead silent. Thus, I continued, "We can't solve anything accusing one another. All we can do is keep it calm and search until we've found the letter."<br>"And if it's too late?" Amigo questioned.<br>"Then it's too late. If we can't pull this one off, the we still have a mission and a whole journey to make."<br>I looked at Thrust at this point, surprised to see him showing a hint of approval on his face. Boy, did that feel good.<br>But then we heard someone calling "Psst!" in a feminine voice. Sure enough, a woman appeared at the mouth of an underground cave. But I could tell her apart from a normal woman, because she wore a mask and a straw hat and wore an apron that stylishly did not harmonize with the former.<br>"Over here!" she invited us to come closer, which we did.<br>"And who would you be?" I questioned.<br>"Madam X, youngster."<br>"Madam X? 'X' as in 'find the X in an equation'?"<br>"That's classified information. And who are you?"<br>"T200."<br>"You think I'm stupid? That's not your real name!"<br>"My parents never told me my real name -- they said it was 'classified information'." I replied sarcastically.<br>"Haha, you're funny, from what I can tell. And look at your wanwan! Oh, how cute it is!"<br>She reached for Thrust, but he got defensive with lightning sparking from his fur.<br>"Anyway," I interrupted, "what did you call us for?"<br>"Oh, I was just wondering what the commotion was all about."<br>Amigo stepped forward when she finished, "O-ho-ho! I know what's goin' on 'ere! You're a spy! Si, I know you know that! You're one disgusting conqueror's worm! But all in all, hubba-hubba!  "<br>Bob laughed out like a drunken maniac loving every second of all the humor until he fainted. X-|<br>"Okay, madam, did you see a pteroz fly somewhere near hear?"<br>Madam X looked at me and then took a moment to think.<br>"Is it a red-brownish pteroz with a straight beak?"<br>"Yep, that's the one."<br>"I did! In fact, it landed not too far from here. It seemed to be in a hurry."<br>"Great! Pleasure doing business with you, madam."<br>"Business? No business is business without cash, you know."<br>Just to be grateful, I handed her five sterrals (Dinoland currency), and then we parted, Amigos now accusing Amigo that "You drool over every girl in sight!" in the background. (I had to carry the unconscious Bob)<br>And it didn't take long to find Benroy's pteroz. In its time of brake, we surrounded the dino and Thrust electrified the letter out of its beak. Mission accomplished, we turned southward for the Frish Port...but stopped at a notice sheet hammered to a tree by nails. The dino illustrated on it looked exactly like Thrust. But the most unwelcoming part was the topic of that notice: "WANTED"<br>"Ooh, man," breathed Amigo, "We've become Dinolands top criminals number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5!"<br>I promptly snatched the notice off the tree and rolled it tight, about to destroy it until I was interrupted...<br>Three softpig riders approached us in uniforms. The cops, who they were, made their way towards us with serious eyes that showed no mercy.<br>"Are you Thrust's master?" they asked.<br>"Aye."<br>"On behalf of the government of Dinoland and the reinforcement of the law, you are under arrest for commanding the demons."<br>Nothing made sense. Clearly, some conquerors did not want me mingling in their business, but I had no idea that they'd have influence over the cops.<br>Without thinking, we ran, ran as fast as we could through the thick forest (which, thankfully, slowed the softpigs down). The cops trailed behind us, on several occasions barely reaching us with their softpigs horns. We ran until we saw a cliff in the near distance. We jumped, we tumbled down, and crashed into an old, wooden house, dealing a large hole into its wall. The softpigs could not trail us from there. They were simply not meant for steep terrains.<br>We all took a breather while the korgons did their usually routine after a victory (making fun off them). But I and Thrust looked more carefully. All of a sudden, they weren't cops anymore.<br>"Wait a second," I said, "Those aren't cops! Those are conquerors!"<br>I was confident of that because I could tell their uniforms were not correctly donned on them. Some aspects of a real Dinoland cop were missing.<br>"They must have taken over the police station, as well."<br>"but before I could start appreciating my little break another danger, as I should've expected, flew down the cliff..."Pteroz riders!"<br>I had to act swiftly...I grabbed a wide plank of the old house,, stepped onto it, ordered the korgons to grab tightly to my neck or rucksack, and handed Thrust one end of the rope I carried.<br>"Thrust, accelerate!!"<br>And the next moment, we were sand-surfing! We must've been the first ever in history to and-surf, and at such speeds that the pteroz struggled catching up on us! But even so, each pteroz had a wanwan, all of which landed on the ground and accelerated after us. These conqueror’s wanwans had vest with small gadgets on their backs -- tracking devises -- so that the wanwans could report to their masters of anything they had found.<br>More importantly, however, we were being chased. Thrust nearly received a bite from an enemy wanwan, just dodging it by an inch. Two of the dinos cornered Thrust by two sides while the third was harassing me (only survived because the korgons formed themselves like a chain and interrupted in as many of the wanwan's attacks as they could).<br>In sight of another cliff that lay in front of us, the wanwans backed down and we stopped just shy of the edge, and for a second time I saw the fear expressed on Thrust's face...the water...a wanwan's greatest fear. But my greatest fear was this: the whole cliff was made entirely of sand! Formed somehow by nature, the cliff of sand could only mean one thing -- danger -- and we were at its edge!<br>Thrust climbed up to my shoulder, trying to keep as much distance from the water as possible while we saw the pteroz approach. How foolish it was of me to take a defensive stance and prepare to fight when it wasn't the conqueror's intention. I should have run for it.<br>The master of the middle pteroz ordered, "Combustion!" and it dived down, it's bill pierced into the soft sand, and a loud boom sounded...followed by cracks and slipping noises of rocks and sand. The water started to come close to us fast as we felt the wind blow from beneath...<br>SPLASH!!!<br><br><br>Chapter 7:  A Watery Welcome <br><br>“You think we ought to check to make sure?” a pteroz rider asked.<br>“Nah, who could survive a 100-foot drop?” the center rider spoke, “Let’s just report and get back to our posts.”<br>They left without knowing if we were at our watery graves. After about a minute underwater, the buoy in my rucksack floated me to the surface where I started looking for Thrust and the korgons. As soon as I found all three korgons, Thrust found me climbed on top of my head, shaking off the water and holding on tight.<br>I paddled with my hands hard, still unaware that the conquerors had left me for dead in this ocean. Four hours had past by the time we reached an island, not caring what it was called. We were all exhausted: all three korgons nearly fainted with their first steps of dry land and Thrust ran up the tallest hill of the beach to dry off. I also lied down to sunbathe and rest my tired limbs.<br>After I felt rested up, I looked around. I could not make up much of the desert island, except for a few twigs that lay randomly on the sand, which I could use to light a fire. But when I scurried in my rucksack, I realized I had forgotten to take a flint! Out of all the tools needed for survival, I didn’t bring the most important tool!!  <br>Before venturing off this nowhere, I spotted a hippoclamp on the water gliding just off the shore, which I slowly approached, armed myself with my rope, and then wrestled with it until I succeeded in tying its mouth shut (so that it couldn’t use its water cannon).<br>“Oh wow, look at that hippoclamp!” said Amigo, “Aww, isn’t she a cutie?”<br>“Si! Si!” shouted Bob.<br>“Si, for the first time, I agree with you,” followed Amigos.<br>“Si-i, what a natural beauty… Let’s eat her!”<br>“No, we’re gonna need this hippoclamp. The Atlanteids is consisted of 5000 islands. This hippo must be a mature 10-year-old, so it can navigate us through the islands.”<br>“Hey, can’t we just have a leg?” Amigo complained, “Just a little nibble, please? Look at this (showing his stomach), it’s crying out. Can you hear it? Can you, Amigos?”<br>“No.”<br>“Can you, Bob?”<br>“No.”<br>“Can you, Thrust?”<br>But Thrust just yawned.<br>The hippoclamp obediently followed my orders as we left the island as fast as we could. We rode on its back, the korgons sat in front of me…and Thrust grabbed tight onto my neck, looking down at the water with wide eyes. But all in all, we arrived at the next island with little effort, this time. This island was larger, and seemed to be populated, as I could tell from idle pickaxes lying near a cavern.<br>We walked towards the cavern entrance with caution while I tugged the wild hippoclamp by the rope. It was very dark when seen from outside. I couldn’t see anything inside and decided it wasn’t worth answering the temptation of adventure. <br>But slowly, a light shined from inside that cave… It got brighter and brither until I had to cover my eyes with my eyebrows to see what it was…and then I creature half as tall as I was passed by and making the lot of us jump.<br>“Excuse me,” it said politely.<br>And then another of the same creature passed by with “Excuse me.” And then a third one passed by, and then the fourth…until a whole hoard of the beings were passing us with a load of “Excuse me”s.<br>They were Atlanean miners, workers of that area. They were half man and half fish creatures with one common hobby: work, work, and work.<br>I asked the last passing Atlantean who was in charge. He explained that no one was really in charge of everything, teamwork was their innate character. But he did point out the top miner of the island, an Atlantean who had high ambitions to become the best minor in their history (although he didn’t look like much of a match, even to the korgons). So I approached him, apologized for interrupting his work, and asked for a flint.<br>“A flint? Who needs a flint when you can have a dry Atlanteid coral?”<br>He generously gave me a piece of his coral stones, and then continued, “Is that it?”<br>“Well, yea, that’s all we really need.”<br>“Oh, come on, you’re too nice! Come, you and your buddies, we’re having a big dinner tonight! It’s already getting late, and you don’t want to be swimming in the ocean at dark, believe me.”<br>I refused several more times, but he finally persuaded me to join them. I guessed Thrust and the boys (and also the hippoclamp) had deserved a well-earned meal and rest for going through all the things for me (for most part of the journey, I felt I was giving orders all the time).<br>We sure did eat well. The Atlanteans were so generous people that I could almost not tell them apart from my kind. After we ate, they showed us our room where we could sleep for the night, and there we rested. The next day, I asked the same miner who invited me to stay with them about how to navigate through the islands to get to Gumhel Forest.<br>“It won’t be so easy,” he explained, “But you must keep going east from here until you reach the Mutant Falls. Beware, though, the swamp standing in between poses a threat to those who cross it. There are even rumors that tell of a creature that dwells in the quagmire, devouring the brave and foolish. I suggest you go around it; there are plenty of islands to take a pit stop.<br>“Once you reach the Mutant Falls, talk to Master Hydragol, the senior Zenzen monk. He will help you get to the forest. Head north from the Falls and you will reach the Edge of the Forest! Sorry I can’t tell you anything more. I’m limited to these islands.”<br>“That’s okay.”<br>I thanked him and gave gold nugget of the few that I had, and we proceeded eastward. We all felt refreshed and merry. The watery path was peaceful and smooth and we could easily make our way to the next island. The Coral stone proved itself useful to making a fire to cook our lunch (pirhanoz) and to dry the two letters I had.<br>We were ready to go forward again…but this time we were not alone…<br>As soon as we mounted on the hippoclamp, a strange stir caused ripples in the water. A moment later, something jetted up from the water and flipped us over! The creature roared and slashed its raptorial legs (the claws of a mantis) at us, but its eyesight was only good underwater.<br>“Trust! Focus!!” I roared as soon as we made it to solid ground.<br>He stood ready and his fur slowly collected glow. The first spark of lightning blurted our, but when it did, the lightning attack Thrust was generating backfired immediately at the drenched wanwan…and he fell unconscious!<br>“Thrust!!”<br>The eeloz slashed again…<br><br><br>Chapter 8: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_default.gif">The Swamp<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_default.gif"><br><br>The eeloz slashed its raptorial leg again; we dodged it and fell back further out on land. But it followed us, using its claws to crawl, something I had not expected, at which point a snatched a random stick and started fighting the best I could.<br>The korgons dragged Thrust to a safe distance…and stared arguing again about how to revive him.<br>I, however, was struggling in the fight. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"> As soon as the eeloz had learned my moves, it caught the stick when I attempted a strike and disarmed me. All that came to mind was to dodge the creature’s attacks. Then, I remembered in my dinoology studies that an eeloz’s weakest point is its lungs. Those I grabbed and tugged onto fiercely, drawing my knife, and about to stab it, but the eeloz electrified me before I even could. The shock left me paralyzed on the ground. I couldn’t move a limb, but could only see the sea monster close up on me and open its jaws.<br>The korgons looked at the situation and started to get desperate.<br>“O man, what to do?!” Amigo looked at random direction until his eyes stopped at the hippoclamp, “I have an idea!”<br>The three sped up to the hippoclamp and took the rope off of it. Unaware of what was going on, it stared at the three korgons climbing onto it back.<br>Amigo continued, “Okay, on my mark: one, two, <strong>THREE!!!</strong>”<br>All at once, they jumped and landed on the hippoclamp’s back, causing it to cough out a gust of <em>mistral</em> and blew the eeloz off of me.<br>“Yea! We’re deadly!!” cheered the korgons while jumping on our ferry (it must have been hard on the hippoclamp).<br>I recovered at that instant and ran towards the hippoclamp, commanding it to aim at the eeloz and shouted, “[b]<em>Gel!!</em>[/b]”<br>The hippoclamp pelted a jet of liquid from its mouth that hit the eeloz with bull’s-eye accuracy. The liquid quickly hardened into a jelly and then hardened even further as the creature tried to free itself from it. A second later, and the jelly was rock-had and froze the monster inside of it.<br>I ran up to the unconscious Thrust, almost weeping, shouted, “Thrust! I’m so sorry!”<br>I picked him up in my arms and attempted to shake him awake, but he didn’t. My heart pumped as if it was ready to stop, but the korgons tried to comfort me:<br>“He’s not dead. Don’t worry, man. We can revive him.”<br>I tried my best to hide my tears. Amigo’s words did comfort me a bit…if not completely. But if I hadn’t made the mistake of telling Thrust to <em>focus</em> while he was soaking wet, none of this would’ve happened. It was no wonder a wanwan’s worst enemy was water.<br>We continued eastward, following the morning sun that was almost over our heads, indicating noon was approaching. Finally, we could see the Sticky Swamp in the horizon. Out of curiosity, I lead the hippoclamp to swim closer…until we arrived at its edge. Amigo was against it:<br>“Have you gone mad? Turn back while you still can!”<br>But I didn’t respond.<br>“Listen to the Atlantean! Remember what he said? Remember what they say: ‘Curiosity killed the cat’…wanwan…knocked unconscious…God, I’m stupid!”<br>“There are all sorts of plants in the swamp. One of those could help revive Thrust. We just need to hind it and get out.”<br>“<em>You’re</em> stupid!” shouted Amigo and supported by Amigos.<br>But in the end, we proceeded forward, with every muscle in our bodies on the ready. We searched and search…and searched some more. I gave my best efforts to finding the plant needed for Thrust, but everything was not right. The korgons searched too, but with less enthusiasm.<br>We had to spend a night in the marsh. There was nothing we could find edible there. To relieve some of my boredom and fear, I looked through the two papers. I looked through the wanted list, but the dim firelight did not give me brightness to observe it carefully. I looked though the parchment from Joe, which I tried reading with difficulty, but managed:<br><br><em>Dear Nicolas,<br>Long time no messages! You haven’t written to me so often every since you graduated from my courses.</em><br><br>So Nicolas Mulot was Joe’s former student.<br><br><em>You may or may not have heard of this, but the second war has already started. Do you remember the costly victory we obtained then? Well, we cannot afford to suffer a larger debt this time. It is my fear that Dinoland will fall in the hands of the conquerors.<br>However, if you meet a young lad, roughly in his 20s with a yellow, wild wanwan, then I sent him. I want you to take a sample of the gluon he will bring you and research its properties, for I believe that there is a substance in the gluon that makes it powerful and indestructible until it fades of age. I would love to do it myself, but I am far too old to do such work anymore.<br>But I fear though, unless this message has somehow found its way to you by miracle, it is very possible to be intercepted. If you do receive Skora, please keep her with you until the war is over. You know how precious she is to me.</em><br><br>And then from that sentence, the words became sloppy and hard to read, but this is how I interpreted it:<br><br><em>If she is intercepted, know <strong>eeloz azaldouip</strong></em><br><br>Whatever that was… I felt sorry though for the ole timer. What would he feel if he found out?<br>The next morning, we searched again…hour after hour, but soon I realized: I wasn’t a botanist. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/nooo.gif"><br>Amigo stepped forward to, seemingly freaked out of the mushy ground and foggy view of the quagmire, “What do you think you’re doing? Guessing is so not going to help, man.”<br>“You’re right,” I sighed, “I’m a dinoologist, not a botanist.”<br>“Oye, let’s just quietly made our way out by following our footprints.”<br> But the problem was the footprints we left had vanished! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/eek.gif"> What was more, Thrust, the other korgons, and the hippoclamp had all vanished!<br>Amigo gave an irritated glance and uttered, “I hate it when we have to play hide-and...WHOA!!!”<br>“Amigo!!!”<br>A gust of mist swallowed Amigo into its body. Before I could break into a run to find him, the wind hurtled me of my feet, as well. I landed onto the soggy earth, covered in the stinky mud as mist twirled around me. I felt scared, to tell the truth, as I could tell from my legs twitching uncontrollably as I stood up.<br>Then the mist ceased twirling. I ran to and fro in search of my comrades, but without success. Every time I thought I was close to one of them, the mist turned aggressive and threw me off to a random direction.<br>I didn’t know if I could control any part of limbs. All my muscled seemed to go haywire as I struggled just to stand up. And as soon as I did, the winds howled and encircled me like a cyclone. The range of my vision became so limited that the mist only let me see the ground beneath.<br>“Guys! <em>Guys!!</em>” I shouted, but no one responded.<br>And then the worst I could possibly imagine happened: I started seeing small sparks of <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"> in the air. These sparks grew to become lightning bolts, interconnected by the slenderest molecules of air. Now the bolts encircled me until they created a ring of lightning that slowly closed on me.<br>And in front of me appeared…a pair of bright, transparent eyes…<br><br><br>Chapter 9: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_fj.gif">The Monks of the Lily Pad<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_fj.gif"><br><br>The bloodcurdling eyes flashed at me at that moment...and the next, they vanished. Still, the lightning walls were getting closer. I was too stunted to think straight...what that creature could be. Adrenaline rushed through my veins and into my brain...and that adrenaline helped! It was a cloudoz! We were inside a cloudoz! That explained everything. I knew what to do:<br>“Hippoclamp!” I shouted in hopes that it could hear me, “<em><strong>Absolute zero!!</strong></em>”<br>Fortunately, it did hear me: the air grew colder and then icecaps formed on the puddles and streams of the swamp; the <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"> walls that surrounded me diminished to nothingness. I started feeling chilly, since I did not wear heavy clothes, but I wasted no time — as soon as I felt the first drop of water from above, a withdrew the second jar and collected the drops that fell one by one, until the once mist was completely in my container. (One cloudoz-in-a-jar coming right up! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif">:lol<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br>“What just happened?” asked Amigo.<br>“It was a cloudoz,” I explained, “and a cloudoz is living water in the form of gas. So when I ordered the hippo to <em>absolute zero</em>, the water condensed to form liquid...and condensed everything else into ice, as you see.”<br>Amigo nodded at that, then seemed amused about something. It was Amigos, having accidentally jumped into a pond, he was stuck on the wrong side.<br>“Haha! Man, I’ve never had such a laugh for long!” Amigo laughed, “And he probably thinks it’s the other way around. Anyway...Bob, smile.”<br>Bob’s smile a bit repulsive, his upper-front teeth were pointing forward. From that, I could tell he needed the dentist.<br>Amigo grabbed him by the legs and torso, and smashed him on the ice where Amigos was stuck like a pickaxe (Bob fainted from the impact). Job done, we searched for the hippoclamp and Thrust, but they found us instead after roughly a minute of looking. Then Amigo presented to me something he had found:<br>“Look what I found: pelinae leaves!”<br>“Yes, great, but how are we going to revive Thrust of his comma?”<br>“You know, if you grind pelinae leaves and mix with hippoclamp stomach acid you get the angel potion.”<br>“What?! You knew this all along?! Why didn’t you tell me?”<br>“Sorry, senor. It’s just that I didn’t have the time. We were having too much fun being chased, bounty hunted, and being tried to have our limbs torn apart. We had the sensation of almost drowning several time, being burned at the stake, being thrown around like rag dolls, etc, etc. And then I thought, ‘Should I tell him?’ or, ‘Should I not tell him?’ or, ‘What would he say?’, blah, blah, blah, so forth, I thought of home, I thought of away, and I thought about being Korgsey-chow again; I thought of my mother, I thought of my father, and then I thought, ‘What the heck, let him ask first!’”<br>Okay...<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br>We got to work: tying Bob with the rope, we descended him down the hippoclamp’s throat to retrieve the acid. Then I took the pelinae lives from Amigo, crushed them in a cup and added the acid to it.<br>“What’s the reaction?”<br>“No reaction. It’s just the strong acid that’ll wake Thrust. The pelinae leaves just weakens the acid so that it won’t digest his insides.”<br>I poured the potion into Thrust and closed his mouth. Three seconds passed, and he awoke with a huge surprise! He gasped for water and drank from a small puddle that wasn’t frozen. The next moment, he fainted again.<br>“It’ll now take 24 hours for him to wake up. He’ll be perfectly fine then.”<br>And so, we got out of the Sticky Swamp as fast as we could and entered the waters again. We arrived at a strange waterfall. The water from all directions was flowing down it, like a pathway to hell. It was Mutant Falls.<br>We stopped at the Island neighboring the falls, where we met the Zenzen monks. And just like the Atlanteans, they were very hospitable and gave us shelter and food (the food was vegetarian; monks were forbidden to eat meat).<br>Then the headmaster, Master Hydargol, took interest in my stupefied wanwan:<br>“That’s a big wound,” he observed the battle scar on Thrust’s chest, “We’re going to hold a healing ritual this evening for him, if you’d like that.”<br>I couldn’t thank him enough. He did not accept my sterrals or gold, so all I could give him was a standing bow and all the thanks in the world.<br>While they were performing the ritual — praying to the Zenzen spirits for healing powers — I took out the wanted poster and read it though again. In the bright candlelight, I looked at the editing date and realized that it had been printed before Thrust was even born! I then looked closer into the wanwan’s eyes, and it wasn’t the same as Thrust’s either. Thrust had bright green eyes, this one had darker green with a hint of red — we were being framed!<br>After the ritual was over, we all sat down under the midnight moon and listened to the stories Master Hydargol gave us. One of them, <em>Rise of the Dinoz</em>, particularly stole my attention:<br>“...For as long as our history can remember, the rise of the Dinoz was the dawn of a new age in human history.<br>“Long ago, we were the people outsiders paid most attention to and sought the most help from. And in the time of the pre-wars, when the use of dinoz in combat was not discovered, the kings of Dinoland knew they could depend on us to ward off the conquerors. 13 monks could defeat 10,000 conquerors. In payment for our service, the kings gave us their trust and we became close friends, sharing our religions, holding feasts together, and attending their weddings.<br>“But then, a dark man, named Honorus (pronounced [onorus]) Arkon, king of the conquerors of his time, discovered the dinoz’s fighting abilities as he observed them in battle. Having successfully tamed them, he waged another pre-war. We failed, for we, as primitive as we were in technology and knowledge at that time, did not know the powers of the five elements Honorus discovered. We fell to the might of the dinoz...the Zenzen monks became forgotten. The Dinolanders had to depend on their own dinoz to defend their homeland.”<br>I was surprised at how Master Hydargol showed no resentment towards the dinoz. Instead, he encouraged me to raise Thrust and guide him to fight the conquerors.<br>The next day, we released the hippoclamp back into the wild (at which point Amigo shouts, “See ya, seety! Eat ya later!) and Master Hydargol took us on his lily pad (it was huge, man!) to get to Grumhel Forest. With his long staff, he paddled the steered the pad as we sat watching the incredible view of the Mutant Falls.<br>But suddenly, a pirhanoz attacked, but Hydargol deflected it with his martial arts skills! Then another one attacked, back by a second one! And all of a sudden, we were surrounded by tens of hungry pirhanoz! Master Hydargol fought his bravest, deflecting all the pirhanoz in sight, as Amigo used Bob as a baseball bat for the same purpose. But because of the monk’s age, we could not depend on him forever...and the pirhanoz were increasing in number!<br>Thrust lay in the mercy of a hungry death...

For now, I'll give you a little commercial.<br><br><em>In a world of wonders beyond our imagination, there is a land where peace and harmony take root in its people.

But this is not his first time...<br>Join Thrust, Azelle, Skora, and the three korgons as they commence a new mission to find and expose the weakness of their enemy. Follow along as they adventure to new places, learn new skills, make new friends, and face the challenges of <strong>the Treacherous Totem</strong>...<br><br><strong>Thrust 2: Threacherous Totem</strong></em><br><br>Watch in 3D.
