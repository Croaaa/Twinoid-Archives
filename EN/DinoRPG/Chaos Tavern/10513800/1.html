                It's finally here! Merry Christmas, everybody!! As you Welceon and Thrust fans all know, I and Killer60 have been working on a Christmas Special for you all. So now it's ready and the day has arrived. It may be long, so take your time reading it and enjoy our story! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br><br>It was a Christmas Eve on the 24th of December in the Korgon Camp. Every korgon was merry and danced under the Jingle Bells music. Even the Guardians were wearing Christmas hats and were hover-dancing in the air. The night was surely magical…<br>   Amigo, Amigos, and Bob were spending the holiday home. During their stay, Amigo had been constructing an intriguing machine that attracted crowd of korgons. Finally, on that Christmas Eve, he was done.<br>AMIGO: “And now, ladies and gentle-korgons! I present to you the Kingdom Come Christmas Success-Boom Machine! (the crowd roared in cheer) One press of this santaz’s-nose-red button, and all your Christmases will be better than the last!”<br>All the korgons shouted for joy and even overrode the loud Jingle Bells music.<br>AMIGO: “Whatever you do, be the first to press the button!”<br>   The air was filled with the sounds of ‘Me first!’s and the like. But as they did so, Amigos whispered into Amigo’s ear:<br>AMIGOS: “These calculations aren’t correct.”<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cry.gif"><br>AMIGO: “STOP!!!” he shouted after Amigos had finished his brief report, “New plan! Whatever you do, do NOT touch the santaz’s-nose-red button!!”<br>   Now the air was filled with sad and long “Aww…”s.<br>A KORGON: “Why not?”<br>AMIGO: “You do not want to know. It seems that the Kingdom Come Christmas Success-Boom Machine is now the Success <em>Kaboom</em> machine. Don’t believe me? Well, you better! ‘Cause if St. Nick wanted this button to be pressed, he would have dropped a wanwan on it by now!”<br>   And a wanwan was dropped!…<br>   It was a black wanwan that fell from the night sky, so nobody saw it coming.<br>AMIGO: “Whoa, senor, what just happened?” Amigo asked halfheartedly.<br>BLACK WANWAN: “I don’t know,” replied the wanwan, “Some big, fat geek in red pajamas and a kooky towel on his head, riding a caboose pulled by sorry-looking santaz, yanked me by the tail and chunked me away!”<br>AMIGO (uninterested in the story): “Si, si, now get off my machine! Unless, of course, St. Nick really wanted me to push that button, he’d be raining wanwans on us!”<br>   And so it started raining wanwans!…<br>   Amigo was smacking his head in embarrassment when one of the wanwans fell square onto him — and what a coincidence!…It was Thrust!<br>AMIGO: “Oh mi Dios! What happened?” Amigo gave a concerned look.<br>THRUST: “I don’t know…Some big, fat geek in red pajamas and a kooky towel on his head, riding a caboose pulled by sorry-looking santaz, yanked me by the tail and chunked me away!”<br>AMIGO: “Didn’t the black one just say that? By the way — hey, black guy! How long has your paw been on that red button?…”<br>   KABOOM!!!…<br><br>Thrust &amp; Welceon: <strong>C</strong>h<em>r</em>i<em>s</em>t<em>m</em>a<em>s</em> <strong>S</strong>p<em>e</em>c<em>i</em>a<em>l</em>!!!!!!!!!!!!! (by Killer60 and T200)<br><br>Every dino was covered in soot from the explosion. Thrust coughed once before shaking himself off. Then a red glow shot through the sky, followed by a loud and merry “Ho-ho-ho!”<br>BLACK WANWAN (angrily): “It’s the towel-head!” But he was pushing his luck (if he had any <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif">)<br>   Thrust looked carefully up, perceiving that Azelle was up there as well.<br>AZELLE: “<em>Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!!</em>” she trumpeted.<br>   A glidewings accommodated her for her flight down to the camp. To Thrust, she was acting a little strangely. She was wearing the ‘kooky red towel’ and she seemed to be in an upbeat mood.<br>AZELLE: “Woo-hoo!!! It’s not like every day you get to hitch a ride with Santa!”<br>BLACK WANWAN: “Oh, so it was Santa Claus? For a moment, I though it was the red pajama geek.”<br>THRUST: “Hold your horses!” he interrupted interrupted, “Who’s Santa Claus?”<br>AZELLE: “You don’t know Santa Claus?” She gave a skeptical look, but Thrust’s mouth told the truth. And if he didn’t know who Santa Claus was, he didn’t know what Christmas was.<br>THRUST “Why is everybody so unusually happy on this day every year? It’s just so unnatural!”<br>AZELLE: “Oh, for goodness sakes, Thrust! It’s Christmas! The day of joy! You know, when everybody gives presents to each other and be together!”<br>TRHUST (not convinced): “They have a special day for that? Why can’t they do that any time they want?”<br>AZELLE: “No, no! See, Christmas is…Christmas…God, if someone can convince you, he’ll convince every Joe on earth!”<br>THRUST “Okay, say I believe in Christmas, but what’s the big deal?”<br>AZELLE (to the korgons): “Boys, demonstrate.” <br>AMIGO: “On a Christmas Day, what could be better than for my Kingdom Come Christmas Success-Boom Machine to WORK?!?!”<br>AMIGOS: “On a Christmas Day, what could be better than to hit the beach and get a tan?”<br>BOB (squeaking): “I like Christmas!”<br>THRUST (scratching his head): “So, Christmas is about getting what you want?”<br>AZELLE: “Well, the boys didn’t give you the perfect example…Okay, here’s how I’ll explain this to you.”<br>   Azelle drew out a small box covered in wrapping paper and pushed it into Thrust’s paws.<br>AZELLE: “I need you to send this present to a certain somebody.”<br>THRUST: “What? Why can’t you or this Santa guy do it?”<br>AZELLE: “Come on, Thrust, it’s only one delivery! Besides, all you do is lie around the couch 24/7.”<br>THRUST: “I’m a wanwan — it’s my job.”<br>AZELLE: “But you didn’t used to be this way.”<br>THRUST: “Well, that was during the war. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Now that that’s gone, I’ve got time to myself. Oh, and thanks for introducing me to that grooming thing (and started grooming himself).”<br>   But Azelle popped a Christmas hat on Thrust, much to his disliking.<br>THRUST: “Hey! You can’t do this to me!”<br>AZELLE: “Sorry, just did, can’t undo.”<br>AMIGO: “Hehe, looks like you’re off on another adventure, guy!”<br>AZELLE: “And you’re going along for the ride.”<br>   She popped a Christmas hat on all three, all of which were outsized for them.<br>AMIGO (to himself): “I think this is korgon rights violation…”<br>   Even though Thrust tried to talk Azelle out of it, she was too stubborn to cooperate. And therefore, the four finally decided to head out and attempt to find this ‘certain somebody’.<br>BLACK WANWAN: “Good luck, towel-heads!!”<br><br>Attempt 1: A little somewhere in the Big All-Hot<br>AMIGO: “Man, are you sure this ‘somebody’ is in this cave?”<br>THRUST: “You never know unless you try.”<br>The four were ready to go inside, but it seemed that whoever was in there was already coming out.<br>AMIGO (to the other korgons): “Hey, maybe we should sing a carol to set the mood, no?”<br>ALL THREE KORGONS: “<em>Jingle Bells</em>…uh-oh!”<br>The one living in the cave made himself visible.<br>VENERABLE: “Merry Christmas,…DINNERS!!”<br>The Venerable chased them down the mountain as they snowboarded with a piece of bark…<br><br>Attempt 2: Dinoland<br>They asked the smashrooms — but they weren’t expecting any gifts…<br>They asked the wolves — they weren’t expecting any gifts…<br>They asked the University elementals — they weren’t expecting anything…<br>They asked the green giants — bad idea!…<br><br>Attempt 3: Dinoland Police Station<br>Thrust helped <em>accelerate</em> the lot of them to safety, arriving at the Dinoland Police Station.<br>Thrust knocked on the door, asked the police, but they gave him a speeding ticket…<br><br>Attempt 4: Waikiki Island<br>They swam the long distance from the Firsh Port to Waikiki Island.<br>Thrust, all drenched in salt water, asked an eeloz, but it electrified him (quite an ouchie when you’re soaked in salt water)…<br><br>THRUST (panting): “This is the worst Christmas ever!”<br>AMIGO: “Maybe we should go check at the Atlanteid?”<br>THRSUT: “For the love of Pete, if we see another eeloz, you’re giving me 10 of your acorns!”<br>AMIGO: “Come on, man…bet something too!”<br>THRUST: “5 fish.”<br>AMIGO: “I’ll raise you 5 more acorns.”<br>THRUST: “Fine, that’s 2 fish and a half. Plus, if I win, you’re gonna do the housework for the next 6 months.”<br>AMIGO: “And if I win, you lose!”<br>O_o<br><br>Welceon got a note at his hut from and gildwings. It was from a relative of his saying Happy Christmas!<br>The weirdest thing Welceon that it was raining Wan-Wans a few minutes ago. Though Welceon’s home was on Waikiki Island and then he heard something. Then Welceon saw a Wan-Wan with a few korgans running, it was his old pal Thrust. Welceon said “Merry Christmas” to Thrust and Thrust told him about the present and Azelle. Welceon offered to help so Welceon follows Thrust on his Christmas Adventure…….<br><br>Attempt 5<br>They went to Master Hydargol, but he lulled them to sleep with his stories...until they fell off the waterfall. Welceon had to swim and bring Thrust and the three korgons back to land.<br><br>Attempt 6<br>They asked a fellow korgon, but he appeared to be an avenger! The whole bandit group surrounded, but then started laughing their tiny korgon ears off because of Thrust’s Christmas hat. Welceon used cold shower. Dark clouds moved up ahead and a drenching intense rain storm started lowering visibility to 0. But Welceon had the eyes of a sirain which could see through the rain storm as clear as day.<br><br>Attempt 7: Back at Korgon Camp<br>AZELLE: “Get your rears back into it!!”<br>ALTOGETHER: “Awww…”<br>And they left…<br><br>Attempt 8: Somewhere in the Big All-Hot…again<br>VENERABLE (upon seeing Welceon): “Ooh, you brought me desert?”<br>No one could answer…<br>BOB: “Jingle bells!”<br>And so they were chased back down to the Precipitous Hills.<br><br>THRUST: “That’s it! I hate Christmas!”<br>WELCEON: “You can’t hate Christmas. Christmas is a time of love.”<br>THRUST: “I can love any time I want! Why do I need this retarded Christmas?!”<br>AMIGO: “Calm down, man! I have an idea. Why don’t we just give it to somebody?”<br>THRUST: “That’s a plan! Why don’t we do that?”<br>WELCEON: “Hey! That’s no way to behave during Christmas!”<br>THRUST: “Christmas-isthmus! Who cares?”<br>WELCEON: “Maybe you should look at the tag first?”<br>A tag? They looked at the tag: “To Leafblaze”.<br>THRUST: *-_-<br>So it was finally clear to whom the gift was. But just when Welceon was going to lead them to Leafblaze’s home, they found two baby dinoz: a wanwan and a sirain — all alone with no love or presents. At that, Thrust began to feel guilty. He knew something was wrong and he had to do something about it.<br>The two babes looked at them with their large and sad eyes. Thrust and Welceon looked at each other and then looked back at them. But finally, they gave the present, which was originally going to Leafblaze, to them. Out of joy and excitement, the baby dinoz opened the gift and were as happy as if they were given their first gift in life.<br>Thrust, at that, felt a warm and tingly feelingly inside of him. A smile unnoticeably cracked on his face and he could sense that what they had done was a good deed. He started to understand the meaning of Christmas. It was a day of love and compassion to those close to him and even to those whom he did not know. And whoever the man was who created Christmas, he was definitely a great man!<br>Suddenly, they saw Santa riding overhead. Welceon <em>perceived</em> with his keen vision where St. Nick was heading and saw that he had purposely dropped a present on an island in the Atlanteids.<br>WELCEON: “I think that’s meant for us. I’ll get it.”<br>THRUST: “Take the boys with you then. I’ll go to pay Leafblaze a visit.”<br>So Welceon told Thrust how to go to get to Leafblaze and then left with the korgons southwards (all the while Thrust was having tea with Leafblaze and talking about things other than the surprise).<br>They arrived at Waikiki Island.<br>AMIGO: “You know, Welceon, this is where I met my true love.”<br>AMIGOS (correcting): “True dinner.”<br>AMIGO: “Si, that’s what I meant.”<br>Welceon used his <em>perception</em> skill to track down the gift, but it was harder to do than they thought. After they had confirmed that the gift was not on Waikiki Island, they moved onto a different island. It wasn’t their either. So they moved to many other islands, but found nothing.<br>Then, while they were swimming to their next destination, Amigo felt some strange static shock in the water.<br>AMIGO: “Eh, Welceon, what do eeloz sing for Christmas?”<br>A school of eeloz rose up from the water in a perfect circle around them.<br>EELOZ: “Jingle lunch, jingle lunch, jingle our meal!”<br>ALTOGETHER: “Sod it!!!”<br>And they swam as fast as they could, running into some kazkadines who also broke into song.<br>KAZKADINES: “Dashing through the water, in a three-korgon-open sirain…!”<br>AMIGO: “Leave us alone!”<br>They swam further, this time hiding in the Sticky Swamp.<br>AMIGO: “Okay, I don’t know why we are such a popular Christmas treat.”<br>AMIGOS: “We’re korgons and there are more than 100 ways to cook us.”<br>AMIGO: “Oh yea, tell that to the avengers.”<br>WELCEON: “Calm down guys. The Atlanteid is my home, so don’t worry.”<br>AMIGOS: “Oh yea? Even when we’re stranded because a hundred eeloz are surrounding the swamp?!”<br>It was so. A hundred eeloz were encircling the Sticky Swamp to capture their ‘Christmas dinner’. But Welceon knew better: They sped deep underwater where the eeloz had least expected them to go through. They arrived back on Waikiki Island to recheck the place, because Welceon was sure that the gift had fallen there.<br>Then Amigo spotted his ‘true dinner’ — the hippoclamp!<br>AMIGO: “Hey! It’s you, sweetie! Long time no see! How is my dinner, eh?”<br>HIPPOCLAMP (in a man’s voice): “My name is Ricardo!”<br>AMIGO: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif">O_O<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/exclaim.gif"><br>AMIGOS: “Well, at least he’s Spanish…”<br>WELCEON: “Hippo…I mean Ricardo, have you seen a gift fall from the sky?”<br>RICARDO: “Si, si… But then it got moved away.”<br>WELCEON: “How?”<br>RICARDO: “By some strange, long, big, eléctrico fish-creatures.”<br>AMIGO: “Eléctrico means ‘electric’.”<br>WELCEON: “Eeloz…”<br>At that, the same school of eeloz that sang the wacky ‘Jingle Bells’ sprang out from the water and encircled them again. Now Welceon and the three korgons had completely nowhere to go. The starving eeloz wanted their Christmas dinner badly and they were determined to get it.<br>1ST EELOZ: “Looks like it’s a quadruple chunk of ham in one!”<br>2ND EELOZ: “No, it’s better! They’re korgons — my favorite!”<br>3RD EELOZ: “And the sirain looks like a tall tower of ice-cream scoops to me!”<br>4TH EELOZ: “Let’s hurry up and roast ‘em!”<br>Welceon <em>perceived</em> into one of the eeloz stomach…and there it was — inside its guts!<br>But the eeloz’s raptorial legs lit up in lightning. It would only be a few second before the four would feel their guts being fried. But then, vines from the ground attack half of the eeloz, squeezing them down to the sand and allowing Welceon and the korgons some room to move away. It was Leafblaze and Thrust! Thrust electrocuted the remaining eeloz with <em>flash wave</em>, and then the two joined in with the group. Again, more eeloz appeared. And this time, by the hundreds! Thrust, Welceon, and Leafblaze fought bravely against as many as they could. They could fell some down from range before the battle turned melee. Luckily, Ricardo the hippoclamp was also on their side. He triggered <em>absolute zero</em> on the eeloz who were in the water, eliminating about half of them. But there were still too many to encounter in close-combat.<br>AMIGO: “<em><strong>Primal state! Primal state!!</strong></em>”<br>Thrust answered Amigo’s commandment and zapped all the eeloz at once in his special state. So the good news was they didn’t have to fight hand-to-hand after all!<br>WELCEON: “Now, how do we get the gift out?”<br>AMIGO: “Well, you know how distance equals the product of speed and time?”<br>EVERYBODY ELSE: “Uhh…yea…”<br>AMIGO: “So it’s the same here! Angel’s potion equals the product of pelinae leaves and going down into the guts of a hippo.”<br>RICARDO: “Hey! You’re not doing that again!”<br>THRUST: “So what’s your point?”<br>AMIGO: “The point is to get down one’s gut, you need to get down into the guts of a hippo equals the division of angel’s potion by pelinae leaves.”<br>EVERYBODY: <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br>AMIGO: “Don’t you see? We need pelinae leaves!”<br>AMIGOS: “And do you have any?”<br>AMIGO: “Yep, always carry an extra batch of ‘em!”<br>So they forced the pelinae leaves down the eeloz (not the hippoclamp) which then regurgitated the gift into Thrust’s paws. Surprisingly, it was totally identical to the original gift for Leafblaze. And the tag said the same thing too! Thusly, Thrust presented the gift to whom it was going to:<br>THRUST: “Merry Christmas…”<br>LEAFBLAZE: “Ugh…thanks…Wow! This is exactly what I wanted!”<br>WELCEON: “What is it?”<br>LEAFBLAZE: “The <em>Learn New Skills: Wood</em> book! Thanks, guys! You’re the best!”<br>Leafblaze snatched everyone into one big hug and squeezed them as tight as he could (which wasn’t a very good idea).<br>Mission accomplished, they decided to head back home when the sound of Santa Claus filled the air.<br>SANTA: “Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas, everybody!”<br>EVERYBODY: “Santa?”<br>SANTA: “I was watching you every step of the way, and I am impressed. So as a treat, who’d like a ride home?”<br>Nobody could resist.<br>Santa invited them all on his sleigh and off they went. They dropped Leafblaze off at the Precipitous Hills, but everybody else was sent to the camp. Upon arriving there, Santa was greeted with a warm welcome from the surprised korgons there.<br>AZELLE: “Well, how was it?”<br>THRUST: “Not bad… You put in quite a hassle, but it turned out to be good.”<br>AZELLE: “I was talking about the ride with Santa.”<br>THRUST: “Oh…”<br>SANTA: “Good work, Thrust… Azelle told me everything about you and that you didn’t know what was Christmas. So I requested her to give you a mission. And because you all did it well, I’m going to give each of you a gift from me. Bob, please accept this Christmas hat I knitted just for you.”<br>Bob jumped from joy and donned the hand-woven hat that fit him perfectly.<br>BOB: “It fits!”<br>SANTA: “Amigos, for your present, this summer will be the warmest summer you’ve ever had.”<br>AMIGOS: “Banzai!! I promise I’m going to celebrate Christmas every year!”<br>SANTA: “Amigo, my present to you is none other than you machine.”<br>AMIGO: “What about it?”<br>Santa waved his hand at the destroyed mechanism and it re-erected itself to its perfect state.<br>SANTA: “I threw that wanwan, because I knew that your calculations were correct all along. Every Christmas will from now be better than the last.”<br>AMIGO: “Yes!! Ha! Amigos, take that!”<br>SANTA: “Welceon, for being a very sincere helper of Thrust, I’m giving you a new skill: the <em>sher-kaar beam</em>.”<br>WELCEON: “But I’ve already received many gifts from my friends and family.”<br>SANTA: “But not form me…”<br>Welceon tested it on some trees that stood nearby. BAM!!! The beam blasted through them (and one beam accidentally hit Amigo, covering him in soot).<br>SANTA: “Use it wisely, though. Be like a lighthouse to those who are lost in this world and protect them from the harms of this planet.”<br>WELCEON: “Yes, Santa. Thank you, Santa!”<br>SANTA: “Thrust, to you I also give a gift.”<br>THRUST: “But Santa, how can I deserve anything? I’ve disbelieved in you all this time.”<br>SANTA: “But you haven’t been naughty; just a little lazy after the war, that’s all. To you I give the <em>leafy dawn</em> skill. Use it to heal and be like a fountain of life to those dependent on you.”<br>So Thrust tested it on Amigo. A radiant light emitted from his eyes and the korgon was no longer covered in soot.<br>At that, Santa mounted on his sleigh and took off with this santaz. And they could him exclaim as he drove out of sight, “Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!”<br><br><br><br>AMIGO: “Thrust! Where’s my fish?”<br>But Welceon shot him with his new beam…
