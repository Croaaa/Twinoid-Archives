One of thé six is coming to Waikiki?”<br>“Yea, quickly, come on you sloth, this is our big chance!” And he runs back to the village. I hesitate no second and follow him as fast as I can.<br>Inside the village it’s a lot more crowded than usual. Somewhere in the middle I see a brown, tough-looking Sirain which I recognize as Chorrys, one of the six Sirains that left years ago with a young human master known as Luiaard. After that many stories about their heroic actions have reached Waikiki, making them the biggest heroes of our tribe since Tholapsys, grandfather of Tholapsyx.<br>Especially the latest stories, about how they almost gave their lives defending the Sanctuary in the last war, has inspired many. Every child in our tribe wants to become just like them and today, I feel it, will be mine and Zeus’ lucky day!<br>“Come on Hydra, we need to get closer!”<br>With a lot of pushing and slipping we reach a spot in the crowd of only 5 feet from Chorrys.<br>“Hey Chorrys, over here!” Zeus shouts, but Chorrys doesn't notice him, turns his back and walks away.<br>“Where’s he going, Zeus?”<br>“How should I know, come on, we have to follow him!”<br>As the crowd slowly dissolves it gets easier to go into the direction Chorrys went, but… where did he go?<br>“Where did he go?”<br>“Wow, Zeus, I was just thinking the same thi-“ “There he is, Hydra, run!”<br>And again I follow Zeus as fast as my little legs can, out of the village to the north-west side of Waikiki.<br>“Chorrys, Chorrys!” Zeus shouts.<br>Chorrys slowly turns his head and mumbles: “Hmm?”<br>“We wanna come with you!”<br>“Come with me? Do you even know where I’m going then?”<br>A small moment of silence as Zeus and I look at eachother questioning. “Eh…”<br>“Well, you can come with me, but you first have to ask your parents for permission.” Chorrys continues.<br>“We already asked them, they were ok with it.” Zeus lies.<br>A smile appears on Chorrys’ face. <br>“You remind me of myself… I never asked my parents either hehe.”<br>“But, but…” Zeus stumbles.<br>But I interrupt him: “Come on Zeus, we’re gonna create our very own story!”
