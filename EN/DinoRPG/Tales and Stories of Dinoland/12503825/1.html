                <p>If you've watched my films, you'll know who Aidan is. If not, he's the orange SIrain I own (I'll change his name.) Anyway, Aidan came from I-don't-know-where and is hunting for his family, who were captured.</p><p>In my films.</p><p>However, here, Aidan is with his family, when this happens. Oh, and the Ben is the hippoclamp I own. He took Aidan's family in my films.</p><p>Here's Chapter One:</p><br><p><img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/chart.png" alt=":tid_chart:" class="tid_ico"> Chapter One: Wanted <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/chart.png" alt=":tid_chart:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><br><p>Oh, boy! This is the life! Pizza, Coke, popcorn, you name it, was spread out on the table. Well, we weren't going to eat the pizza - that was going to be our dinner. But at this 1 'o' clock, we were watching a horror movie. 'Night of the Living Fat-free Cloud Burger'. I was so exited!<br>Well, you may be wondering who I am. Well, I'm Aidan Druesedau, and I have a brother, sister, mum, and dad. We live on Totem Island, but Klutz invited us around to his house. I'm telling you, he may be fat, but he's, like, the coolest guy EVER. I've already started following him on DinoBook! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"><br>'Aidan! Do you want to watch it or not?'<br>That's my dad. He doesn't like Klutz because he thinks he's really silly. Well, my dad's a bank manager. He's a very respected individual in the Sirain Department of the Dinoland bank.<br>'Coming, dad!'</p><p>'WOW! That was great!' cried my sister two hours later. 'I loved the bit where the Cloud Burger laughs evilly in the night and then this guy says, "Keep the noise down! Some of us are trying to sleep here!"'<br>Well, in MY opinion, it wasn't as good as I thought it'd be. I mean, what kind of Cloud Burger laughs when it doesn't even have a mouth? And how on ear- BANG.<br>BANG.<br>BANG.<br>BANG.<br>'LET ME IN!'<br>Klutz opened the door.<br>There stood the biggest Moueffe I've ever seen! He had a yellow tatoo of the letters D.C.<br>'Mr. Slope, the head of Dinoz Catchers,' he said. 'I've come to see if you've seen this Hippoclamp.' He held up a WANTED poster:</p><p><em>WANTED<br><br>Ben the Hippoclamp<br>Appearance: White<br>Reward: 1.000.000 gold coins and 1.000.000 gold coins worth of treasury notes.</em></p><p>'You're a bounty hunter?' asked my dad.<br>'No,' said Mr. Slope. 'I'm not in it for the money. I want to spread justice.'<br>'Well, let's find him! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico">' cried Klutz.<br>'I'll give you 3 weeks,' said Mr. Slope. 'I got a tip-off he's planning to do something on 3 weeks.'<br>'Thanks, Klutz. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico">' said my brother.<br>'Hey, cheer up!' cried Klutz. 'It'll be fun! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico">'<br>'Any idea where we can find him?' asked my mum.<br>'No idea,' said Mr. Slope. 'But you could try asking Bao Bob. He's not far from here.'<br>'Thanks.' we said, and walked out of the door (except for Klutz; he danced).</p><p>And that's how our journey started...</p><br><br><p>I'll post one chapter a day, and when the holidays are over, only one Saturdays.</p>

After all, he must have learnt from his mistakes after 4999 attempts.<br>‘Oh... dang it!’ cried Klutz. ‘I need energy! A simple Lightning Energy would do, but you’re water dinoz...’<br>‘Klutz, I’ve got the skill.’ I said. ‘Where’s the closest place to get one?’<br>‘Brutforce, the Underwater Dome, Basalt Slopes, Blacksylvia Door, Devourer of the North, Nirvana Falls.’ he replied.<br>‘<strong>The closest.</strong>’<br>‘Oh, that would be the Underwater Dome.’<br>‘Where?’<br>‘I’ll tell you the story.’<br>‘Is it short?’<br>‘No.’<br>‘So can I go?’<br>‘No.’<br>‘*groan* <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico">‘<br>‘Here’s the story! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico">’</p><p><em>After the Great Cataclysm, Jazz Island split up, and one place was called the Underwater Dome. It is, of course, underwater. However, diving in the sea to get to the entrance could be fatal. Creatures called Scorpscubas could break in through the walls. 500 years ago, a man called the Archsage rode one inside. He cast a spell to make the walls repair themselves when broken. But he was also casting a curse. He would never leave again.<br>His young apprentice found him when just 600 years old. He defended the Underwater Dome from Scorpscuba attacks and was known as the Atlantean Guard. He sent a letter to his friend, Joveboze, telling him to make Scorpscuba Callers – to call tame Scorpscubas who could take young Masters to the Underwater Dome. Joveboze set up in Frish Port and learnt the language of the Frishers. However, he found he needed Scorpscuba bone to make a caller. He told Masters to fight Scorpscubas, and made them callers.</em></p><p>‘Well, thanks for the story,’ I said. ‘But got any tips for fighting the Scorpscuba?’<br>‘Take this water charm.’<br>‘Thanks. Anything else?’<br>‘The Scorpscuba has 60HP. He is also very strong in water. That’s all.’<br>‘Thanks, Klutz.’<br>We left for the Frish Port...</p>

It was huge! It had a big blue body and it dealt 14 damage to all 4 of us simultaneously (Joveboze chickened out and stayed in his hut. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico">)! I dived into the water and appeared behind the Scorpscuba – without him noticing. I signalled for my brother to come to me and the rest of my family to attack. While they attacked from the front, we attacked from the back. Before long, we had defeated him.</p><p>‘ya f’nshed? ‘erygud!’ exclaimed Joveboze as we showed him the bone.</p><p>After 2 long hours working, he had finally finished!</p><p>‘Let’s go to Mutant Falls.’ I said.<br>So off we went...</p><p><strong><em>Day Two</em></strong></p><p>We arrived at Mutant Falls the next day. We saw an old man and one that looked like a fish. We talked to the old man first.</p><p>‘Please... get me...’ he said.</p><p>‘A pad... of waterlilly...’ he continued.</p><p>‘From where? I asked him.</p><p>‘Find... my apprentice...’</p><p>Then we talked to the fish-like man.</p><p>‘I’m the Atlantean Guard,’ he said. ‘But who are you?’</p><p>‘We seek the Underwater Dome.’ I said. ‘We have the Scorpscuba Caller.’</p><p>‘You must blow in it,’ said the guard. ‘That will attract the Scorpscuba.’</p><p>I thanked him and took out the Caller (even though I had no hands <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico">) and raised it to my mouth. I blew a note into it. Nothing happened. I blew again. Still nothing happened. I blew as hard as I could. My face went red with the effort – a useless one.</p><p>‘Um, why isn’t this working?’ I asked the guard.</p><p>‘Because you must blow it underwater. The sounds attract the creature.’</p><p>‘OK, thanks!’</p><p>I dipped the small end into the water and blew. I heard a low sound grow larger as a Scorpscuba rushed towards us. The horn was making a sound like a foghorn and I struggled to keep it still in the water. If it lost the sound for just one second, it would go away.</p><p>It was only a couple of minutes, but it seemed like it was taking forever for the creature to come. It was soon here, though, and I climbed onto its back.</p><p>‘No,’ laughed the guard. ‘You must ride inside its mouth.’</p><p>I dived into the sea and my ears were immediately clogged with water. It rushed up my nose; it got into my eyes; it repelled me away from the mouth. I struggled to reach the mouth and the water pushed me down into the water. I hit the seabed and was so shocked I took in a breath of water. It got into my lungs and I lay down. While all this was happening, my family and the guard were sitting in the mouth, waiting for me to appear, completely oblivious to the fact I was drowning underwater...</p>

Then the guard sensed something was wrong. He dived into the water and grabbed my leg. He pulled me up into the Scorpscuba’s mouth, but I was unconscious. He panicked. My mother burst into tears.<br>‘Oh, my baby! <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":tid_cry:" class="tid_ico">’ she sobbed.<br>‘There, there.’ said my father.<br>The guard tried everything. He called out to the Scorpscuba, ‘Vacuum Disk!’ The Vacuum Disk made a Vacuum inside the Scorpscuba, but then I ran out of air. ’Mistral!’ cried the guard. The air blew on me – but it was too cold – I had frozen. ‘Burning Breath!’ cried the guard. It then got too hot. ‘Flood!’ cried the guard. When it had put out the fire, he said ‘Celerity!’ at himself. He dashed to me and brought me out of the water. He gave me some bread and water. The bread was nice Authentic Warm Bread, but the water had been taken out of the Fountain of Youth – it’s salty taste made me feel even more sick. By now, my mother was sobbing hysterically.<br>‘OH! MY BAABBBYYYY! <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":tid_cry:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":tid_cry:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/cry.png" alt=":tid_cry:" class="tid_ico">’ she cried.<br>‘Um... there, there? <img src="../../../../gfx/square/huh.png" alt="O_o" class="tid_ico">’ said my father.<br>The guard made a healthy Aqueous Clone of me to make my mother happy, but she hugged it so tight she suffocated it, and she was convinced she had killed me.<br>The guard gave me some more bread. I opened my eyes and saw the guard’s face sway above me. He gave me a Cloud Burger (Fat-free! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) and I started to recover. He gave me a Meat Pie, and my vision started coming in to focus. I got up and walked out of the Scorpscuba and into the Underwater Dome.<br>‘When you’ve all put your eyes back in, you’ll see we’ve arrived.’ I said impatiently. We all came out and I set to work finding a Lightning Energy. I found it in my second square. We climbed back into the Scorpscuba and soon got back to Mutant Falls before getting to Klutz.<br>‘Hello! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/yeah.png" alt=":youpi:" class="tid_ico">’ he said upon seeing us. ‘I’ve just been adding some finishing touches. And when you give me the lightning energy, I’ll get you there and it will have been two days. And via the Sticky Swamp Route, it would have taken three! So you’ve saved a day!’<br>I handed him the Lightning Energy and he placed it in his Klutz 5000.<br>‘Not a bad Klutz.’ I commented.<br>‘Oh, no, I changed the name. It’s now the Flying Klutzo 5000!’<br>‘Good to know.’<br>We all climbed in. It was a tight squeeze, but we managed. I managed to get pushed to the back and my brother sat next to Klutz. He pressed a button. A voice spoke. It was neither male nor female. It was inhuman.<br>‘Launching in ten...’<br>‘Nine...’<br>‘Eight...’<br>‘Seven...’<br>‘Six...’<br>‘Five...’<br>‘Four...’<br>‘Three...’<br>‘Two...’<br>'One...’<br>‘Zero...’<br>BOOM! The Flying Klutzo 5000 shot off like a rocket. We sped towards Bao Bob’s House and we landed there... we broke through his roof!<br>‘WHO ARE YOU? <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/mad.png" alt=":tid_mad:" class="tid_ico">'</p><br><p>Thanks to the Cookies for listing the skill that were in this chapter and also for their maps which helped me in Chapter Two.

Ben the Hippoclamp.’ said Bao Bob, stroking his chin. ‘A fight against him would be unpredictable.’<br>‘What do you mean?’ I asked him.<br>‘Well, he’s a Hippoclamp. Though they come from the Atlantean Islands, they have as much chance as getting Air as getting Water. He may have a range of attacks from all elements. He might have many skills from one element. If you ever have to fight him, be prepared.’<br>‘Well, where is he?’<br>‘Why do you want to find him?’<br>‘That still doesn’t my question.’<br>‘I’m guessing you’re bounty hunters. I do not help bounty hunters.’<br>‘We have no choice.’ said Klutz. It was the first time I’d heard him speak since we went inside the Flying Klutzo 5000. ‘Mr. Slope said we must find him – or else.’<br>‘You are not bounty hunters?’ asked Bao Bob, raising an eyebrow.<br>‘NO!’ I cried.<br>‘Very well. I will tell you what I know.’<br>‘Which is?’ I said impatiently.<br>Bao Bob raised his eyebrow again (he only had one.). ‘Maybe...’<br>‘JUST TELL US WHERE HE IS! WE’VE GOT THREE WEEKS UNTIL HE TURNS US INTO MINCEMEANT!’<br>‘Hey, hey, don’t get in a rage.’ Bao Bob said, looking surprised. ‘As I said, I’ll tell you what I know – but you must learn to be patient.’<br>‘OK. It is said there is one book that contains every fact ever known to mankind. If you know something, and it is not in the book, you must write it down. It is known as the Book of Knowledge.’<br>‘So Ben will have written down where he is?’<br>‘Yes. You must find the book and Ben.’<br>‘Oh, er... thanks.’<br>We left. We had no idea where to find this book, but Grandpa Joe might know. He looks so old he must know everything. He has a long beard which he never cuts because he once lost a bet.</p><p><strong><em>Day Three</em></strong></p><br><p>The next day, we were at Grandpa Joe’s house. I knocked on the door.<br>‘Yes?’ enquired Grandpa Joe, popping his head out of the door.<br>‘We were wondering if you knew where the Book of Knowledge is.’<br>‘Oh, come inside.’<br>We entered the small hut. I saw a door at the back of the room we were in. It seemed there were only two rooms.<br>‘You must have some tea.’<br>We refused his offer. We asked him a question:<br>‘Where is the Book of Knowledge?’<br>‘Oh, that...’ said Grandpa Joe. ‘Well, you might be surprised to find out...’</p><br><p>Come on!

                <p>Sorry, forgot about this story. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So I'll do 3 chapters today. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><br><br><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_home.gif" alt=":hordes_home:" class="tid_ico"> Chapter Nine: The Hotel <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_home.gif" alt=":hordes_home:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>I lay on my bed. Boy, those Caushmesh hotels sure were good! I knew this was the Lap of Luxury: the best hotel ever! I didn't like the food though. Moueffe Mustard? Sirain Spread was all right, but I can't imagine anyone who'd like Pteroz Pizza. Softpig Snack was baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad, and Cloudoz Choclate or Rocky Rumble tasted of spit. They were not, of course, made out of Dinoz - only certain Dinoz can eat certain foods. I, for instance, can only eat Sirain Spread. That's the only good one. I've seen other Dinoz spitting their food out.</p><p>My brother voice brought me back to Earth. 'Um, bro? You can't sleep or whatever. We've got that Hippo to find, remember?'</p><p>'Yeah,' I grumbled, trudging down to the lobby. There, I met someone I never thought I'd meet again.</p><br><br><p><img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/arrow.png" alt=":tid_arrow:" class="tid_ico"> Chapter Ten: A Steep Slope <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/arrow.png" alt=":tid_arrow:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><strong><em>Day Four</em></strong></p><br><p>It was Mr. Slope!</p><p>'Look, you only have three days left,' he panted. 'You need to find Ben!'</p><p>'How did you know we were here?' I asked suspiciously.</p><p>'Look, that doesn't matter,' he said. 'You need to find him! He's on the summit!'</p><p>'How do you know these stuff?' I quizzed him.</p><p>'Bo-er, boy, you don't need to know these stuff.' he said. He made sure noone was listening. 'I need you to find Ben and bring him to me. Use this.' I held out a hand, but he gave it to my father. I couldn't see what it was. Mr. Slope ran to the tower, while we ran to the tower.</p><p>It was a tough climb. Even worse, we were used to the sea. The thin air made us light-head and dizzy, and it wasn't like Caushmesh wasn't inhabited by monsters. We had to fight Air Elementals (similar to their Fire and Water counter parts, but with twice the hp and a common monster), Dark Cloudoz and Pteroz, and even 'Fog Monsters!'</p><p>We eventually reached the summit, and there we saw...</p><br><p><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/icons/r_heal.gif" alt=":drpg_healpv_500:" class="tid_ico"> Chapter Ten: The Potion <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/icons/r_heal.gif" alt=":drpg_healpv_500:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p><strong><em>Day Six</em></strong></p><br><p>Mr. Slope!</p><p>'But you ran to the tower,' I said, confused. 'How did you get here?'</p><p>He sighed. 'The 'Mr. Slope' you just saw was Ben. <em>I</em> am the real Mr. Slope. I came here - I knew you would - while Ben went to the tower. Ben is, if you're wondering, my master. He told you he was here - where we are now. He knows that once I beat you, there will be nothing to stop him. It's taken you two days to reach here!'</p><p>'WHAT?!' I cried. But he was right. There was one day to defeat Mr. Slope and Ben.</p><p>'Battle time!' I cried.</p><br><p><em>Mr. Slope: 750 HP; 100% speeded<br><br>Aidan &amp; his family: 500 HP; 100% speeded<br><br>FIGHT!!!</em></p><p>Move 1: Aidan uses Invocation - <em>'Ondine!'</em> deals 68 damage.<br>Move 2: Mum uses Skill - <em>'Gel!'</em> slows by 5%.<br>Move 3: Dad uses Double Skill - <em>'Electrolysis!'</em> speeds all his party by 5%.<br>Move 4: Bro uses ??? - <em>'Look, can we just get this over with?'</em> deals 682 damage.</p><p><em>K.O.!</em></p><p>'But how did Ben make himself look like you?' I asked.</p><p>'Potion...' Slope breathed. He gave it to me. (That was easy. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">)</p><p>I drank it. Suddenly, I felt a sense of euphoria. The taste of... something magnificent trickled through my body. It went through me. I felt joy... I liked it! I wanted more. I drank the whole bottle. JOY! I LOVED IT! It overpowered my senses; all I could feel was joy. The potion was sweet... the best drink ever! I drank another bottle. My whole body was overwhelmed with happiness. I wanted to stay, and drink that lovely potion. It was so joyous; that was the only way to describe it! No, it was impossible to describe in words! I drank all the bottles, and stood there drinking it for hours! But my family knew something I didn't.</p><p>If I drank one more bottle....</p><p>I might die.</p>
