                <strong>Small introduction-</strong><br>Let's blow some new life into these forums.<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br>For some people this is just a game with some random dino's, while others like me imagine a whole personality behind almost every dino they own, mostly based on their looks, strength and how well their training goes. I guess for those people this section of the forum, though barely alive, has been made. Now imma make use of it and bring my dino's to life, as well as putting my creativity to good use.<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"> The stories don't have to be taken too seriously, but besides that I hope you enjoy them.<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"> I'll update them from time to time. Also, feel free to give comments in this topic.<br><br><br><br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"> <strong>The Dethronement</strong> (Part 1)<br><br><strong>Narrator:</strong> Sangui Tempestas (Luiaard)<br><br><br><br>It’s been a long time ago that I ever felt so excited…<br>Before me, I can hardly believe it, is an actual artifact of The Dethronement! And for being around 100 years old it’s still in a very good shape!<br>I quickly blow off some dust and ashes from the ancient stone, uncovering vague writings. Probably –hopefully-  an old dialect of the Cyzarian tribe. This is what I was looking for!<br>Ever since my grandfather told me about The Dethronement when I were still a little Moueffe I’ve been eager to find out everything about it. I’ve searched the libraries in the University, asked old hero’s like Bao Bob and Joe for information and searched everywhere on the Big All-Hot for artifacts, mostly here in these ancient ruins.  The story of a once great king of all Moueffe’s has always inspired me. It’s the main reason why I joined Master Luiaard’s trainingdojo. But after all the training I went through, I still feel I’m very far from achieving my goal. This is why I’ve been searching these ruins for so long, I need to know everything about this old king Tyrax and how he became so strong.<br>In contrast to humans, the Moueffe throne  isn’t just passed on from father to son. Even though it’s been said that it used to be the same Moueffe family that kept the throne, the king of Moueffe’s is decided on who’s the strongest. In this way the family of the once great Tyrax had always been merciless. The exact training that made them so powerful was a family secret, passed on from father to son. Then after their training was complete they would challenge their own father in a fight to the death, a fight for the throne.<br>As merciless as they were in killing their own family, they were in killing anyone that opposed them. They respected no one, except their own father, who’s skull was placed above the throne.<br>But despite being so cruel, they actually were great leaders. In every war the Moueffe’s went, the king would stand on the front line. His appearance, a size of around 20 feet, flames surrounding his body, and a merciless look in his eyes, would frighten any opponent before the battle had even started. Many wars were ceised because the enemy instantly gave up, intimidated by the huge power the Moueffe forces embodied. But one day…<br>One day a new enemy appeared. A powerful creature, terrorizing the Moueffe tribes. As more and more tribes got slaughtered by this creature, king Tyrax came to act. On top of the Big All-Hot, near the crater, he challenged this new enemy to a fight. This enemy, once known under a different name, is now known as: The Venerable.<br>An epic battle commenced, a fight that lasted for days, with volcanic bombs being thrown all over the battle field. Eventually, The Venerable won through a sneaky trick, and Tyrax got defeated, making The Venerable the new ruler of Big All-Hot.<br>After that it went downward with the Moueffe’s, tribes got divided and the Moueffe race never were as mighty anymore as back in those days.<br>Many Moueffe’s have challenged The Venerable afterwards, but none has been victorious. The Tyrax’ family secret has been carried with them into the grave. Or well… that’s what they say… but I think it’s nothing but a lie, brought into the world by The Venerable himself, afraid that one day there will stand up another Moueffe like Tyrax again.<br>I’ve got high hopes that this artifact will lead me closer to the Tyrax’ family secret. <br>I quickly cast a small fireball, slowly covering the stone with ash again and I silently depart. Hopefully no one noticed me. Now off to the university, I need a dictionary…

                Still have to work on the other story, but had this one finished already.<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"><br><br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_0.gif"><strong>Part 2</strong><br><br>Finally, I arrived.<br>In front of me is a huge white building, the libraries of the University. Somewhere in it I should find a dictionary of the ancient Cyzarian language. Now only to find out where…<br>I step in silently, last time I went here wasn’t much of a success, so I’m probably not really welcome anymore. It’s a good thing that I already know in which part to look, had to get a dictionary for something in the Ruins before, for that weird Shaman. It’ll probably be somewhere around there.<br>I take a slightly longer route to avoid getting caught by that ugly, old librarian who’s hair I set on fire last time. She’ll probably not appreciate seeing me again.<br>Ok, here’s the line in which that other dictionary was, now let’s see…<br>A… B… C… there!<br>Awesome, now let’s sneak out and return to the Ru- “Hey, what are you doing here!”<br>A small, yellow Glidwings is floating in front of me. I really can’t use that little tell-tale right now…<br>“I just need this one book, Alengo, I was just about to leave.”<br>“Well, after what happened last time I can’t just let you walk out of here, Sangui, the librarian must be informed of your presence as you still have to be punished for what you did last time.”<br>Ok, now I’ve lost my patience. I grab the little Glidwing by its throat and angrily whisper:<br>“Look, you flying rat, you’re gonna keep your mouth shut or I’ll set this entire library on fire, you understand?”<br>He looks at me frightened, and nods carefully. But suddenly I notice some steps at the end of the hallway.<br>“Alengo, where did you- OMG, it’s him! Guards!”<br>I quickly throw the little Glidwing into a bookcase and spread my right arm at the librarian. With a loud crack some vines come through the floor and grab her tightly.<br>“Guards!”<br>Oh man, I could kill her so much I hate that woman. Now I have to leave quickly- wait…<br>I run to the librarian and with a small puff I set her hair on fire. Sorry, couldn’t resist doing that…<br>Now to get the hell out of here! One Gorilloz is already on my heels. I throw down some bookcases to slow him down, but it doesn’t really seem to help. Just as I reach the exit something grabs me by the legs. I fall down and instantly get surrounded by vines. Now I’m screwed…<br>From the corner of my eye I see the green Gorilloz walking towards me. I hate Gorilloz’, they always walk as if they’re big shots. As I think of a plan to quickly burn these vines and take down that stupid monkey the library door suddenly cracks out of its joints.<br>“Cuckook!” A white Sirain stands in the door opening and runs as fast as a lightning bolt towards the Gorilloz. He kicks him back into a bookcase with a swift backflip and lands on his feet again. In less than a second later he’s standing next to me, while the sound of falling bookcases fills the building.<br>Burning the vines off my body I ask: “Tymo, why do you always have to follow me?”<br>“Because I know  you have a tendency to get into trouble… and I love trouble!”<br>Oh man…<br>“Don’t you have anyone else to bother?”<br>“Nope, Poseidon’s busy training some new Sirain that Chorrys brought in. And come on, I just saved you there, show some graditute!”<br>“Pff, I could’ve handled it myself easily… now come on, let’s get out of here before more guards show up!”<br>“Oh come on Sangui, can’t we stay? It’ll be fun!”<br>“No, come on damnit!”<br>I run back towards the hills but… where’s Tymo?<br>I look back at the library and still see him in the door opening.<br>“Tymo, what the hell are you doing?! Come on!”<br>“Just a minute Sangui, I just thought of a brilliant idea!”<br>“What?!”<br>“Well, have you ever seen a tornado in a library?”<br>Oh hell no!<br>“No, don’t!”<br>“Too late!” he shouts, while casting a tornado.<br>I facepalm as I hear the roaring tornado demolish the library.<br>“Look at them fly, Sangui, look at them little books flyyyyy!”<br>“Come on you nutcase!”<br>And suddenly he’s standing next to me again.<br>“Last one at the Ruins is a Gluon!”<br>“Hey, how’d you know I was going to the-“<br>But he’s already gone…
