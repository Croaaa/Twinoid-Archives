                <p>Out of 11 eggs, a <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/dinorpg/7/a/142507c3_215643.jpg">single duck</a> was born in an incubator. Several chickens were hatched with it the same week and they all grew up together.</p><p>Drunken Duck (DD) does not thing she is a duck. She will not get in the pool with the other ducks, and roosts in the nesting boxes with the chickens at night. <br>DD pecks the ground in the same fashion as chickens when they forage much unlike the other ducks who hunt insects.</p><p>Not long ago, DD was in the pen content with being a chicken, when a hawk swooped down and killed one of her friends. DD ran into the hen house and hid under the nesting boxes. When her human tried to coax her out later that afternoon, DD would not budge.</p><p>-</p><p>Human has several dogs. One in particular, Ming, has taken enjoyment in patrolling the chicken pen daily finding duck eggs for the human. They tend to lay in curious places, and Ming noses them out easily. <br>Ming gets lots of attention, and more importantly, treats for finding eggs.</p><p>Over time, the flock has grown accustomed to Ming and pay little attention to him. They seem to enjoy his company, and can often be seen laying in the sun with Ming when they are let out into the yard. Even the Guinea hens seem to like Ming as there is no frenzied "alarm" sent out when he enters their domain. Ming became the self-appointed <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/dinorpg/9/3/66abb17e_215643.jpg">guardian of the flock</a>, and he takes his job very seriously.</p><br><p>On this one day, DD hid under the boxes and would not come out. 2 days passed, then another. Human pulled DD out and much quacking and barking ensued; Ming does not like hearing his flock cry when they are frightened and run to DD's aid when human released her.</p><p>Ming led DD to an old abandoned dog house sitting in the corner of the pen. It had been used as a rabbit hutch briefly until it was overrun. <br>Human did not realize how quickly 2 adult rabbits would seemingly overnight become 11, then soon 25, then soon again and again until there were 72.</p><p>When human cleared the pen of rabbits one day, Ming was more than happy to help. There was no love lost between Ming and the bunnies because they had scratch and bitten him before. <br>When some of the meat was used in the homemade dog food, Ming and the pack were very happy.</p><p>DD spent 5 days hiding in the dog house, and many times a day Ming would go and lay with her. They became the odd-couple.</p><p>-</p><p>DD was not always her name. She was at first fondly referred to as Retarduck, but now we always remember her as DD.</p><p>Humans had a BBQ one afternoon and in-laws and some of humans neighbors came to the feast.<br>Rabbit, chickens, and a few ducks were on the menu. People had a grand time and bellies were filled. <br>Neighbors in particular enjoyed giving the pack little handouts of the feast. The Pack rejoiced and befriended all.</p><p>One neighbor noticed that DD was coming up to him when Ming was getting treats. Correctly guessing that ducks normally do not eat meat, he instead offered DD some of his beer.<br>Ducks love puddles. They wait until the liquid seeps into the ground and makes mud, then they root around in it filtering out edibles and dog knows what else they find.<br>When the neighbor tried to pour a little out, Ming licked the bottle. Apparently this did not sit well with the neighbor and he poured the beer out behind his chair not thinking anyone would notice.</p><p>A few minutes pass. The neighbor is about halfway thru his replacement beer when he sees DD rooting in the mud. Neighbor cheerfully pours the rest of his beer into the puddle. DD waddles off, but returns a few moments later and continues rooting. Other ducks arrive, but leave DD alone to her spoils.</p><p>We forget about DD and continue our get together feasting, drinking, and telling the occasional funny tale and then the human notices something.</p><p>DD is in the duck pool, swimming madly in circles, diving, weaving, and bobbing and generally looking like she is having the time of her life. She becomes noisy, quacking loudly when surfacing and staying underwater longer with each dive. Finally she slows, and settles to the center of the pool and just floats.</p><p>She has become a duck after 2 years, and <a target="_blank" href="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/dinorpg/6/8/3b18e6f6_215643.jpg">Ming is satisfied</a>. He has done his job.</p>
