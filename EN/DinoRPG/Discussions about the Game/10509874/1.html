                <cite>Hi T'im A good Dinorpg player but in the french version  here is a  Guide of game that i did but with traductor (sorry for Faults<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/redface.gif"> )</cite><br><strong><u>The Technique of the Merguez sausage:</u></strong><br><br>A big classic, but however very effective to limit the loss of Life. You know all the Salesman of Merguez sausage of Ruins Ashpouk! This nice pyrocuistot which offers you generously 5 Merguez sausages of Tapestry every time you speak to him(her) having eaten everything. And indeed the Technique consists simply in leaving one of your Dinoz permanently with Ruins Ashpouk, so that he(it) provides regularly all the others with Merguez sausage! Because if the maximum of Merguez sausage in the inventory is 5, once 5 Merguez sausages equipped in Dinoz, we can then ask for more of 5, and so on. With 2 slots basic object by Dinoz, 1 with Storeman, that makes you 3 Merguez sausages permanently. In fight a Merguez sausage regenerates you between 1 and 4 lost Life, or can even restore you 1 Life more if it is used while you did not lose Life. Used regularly, Merguez sausages of Tapestry can considerably limit the losses of Life, and  Save thus on the objects of care, Tart and the others Warm Bread..<br>" But celà paralyze Dinoz! " Mrs will say yourselves. And you will be right, however, Dinoz can always make its daily fights, AND, the must is then to put it Dinoz possessing a maximum of skills of Search(Excavation), because as we can Search in Ruin Ashpouk, you can so scratch 3 compartments every day, and with 1 Crown in 40 000 by railing that can be worth <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br><br><strong><u>The Law of the groups:</u></strong><br>Indeed, one of the BIG LAWS of this game(set,play), is the Progress in group!<br><br>Why?<br>Because we so increase the earnings(gain) of Gold and Experience of more than 50 % by dinoz and because we dininue of so much the loss of Life, and thus, the time(weather) of récupération/la frequency of the days of recovery.<br><br>On the other hand we lengthen(stretch out) for certain Mission the time(weather) of the Mission of more than 50 %, but celà still very profitable rest!<br><br>To show you by the example. We are going to take the collection of " The Hunting in Wolves ", experimented with dinoz of level 6 (Moueffe, hyppoclamp and nuagoz):<br><br>For this collection it is necessary 4 movements and to kill 2 Wolves every time (2 to Forcebrut, 2 in the Fountain, 2 to Dinoville and 2 at the University).<br><br>1st CASE: 3 Dinoz level 6 in parallel, each individually.<br>In individual he(it) appears at this level, that a single Wolf in the fight. It is thus necessary to stay 2 days on every site: total 8 days to finish the bag.<br>- Earnings(gain) in Gold: approximately 150 Every day is 1200 Gold in 8 days by Dinoz.<br>- Earnings(gain) in Experience: 8 Experience by Dinoz thus 64 Experience in 8 days by Dinoz.<br>- Loss of Life: approximately 1 to 4 PV a day (according to if Wolves make or not "Bite") thus 18 Life on average by Dinoz.<br><br>- Total for 3 Dinoz: 8 days of collection, 192 gained(won) Experience, 54 consummate Life and 3600 gained(won) Gold.<br><br>2nd CASE: 3 Dinoz level 6 in team.<br>In group there are 2 Wolves by fight. We thus have to stay 1 day by dinoz, that is 3 days on every site for a total of 12 days to finish the bag.<br>- Earnings(gain) in Gold: approximately 900 every day (without counting the possibility that allows of group of 3 to obtain + from 10 000 Gold in 1 fight in 1 % of luck(chance)) is 10800 Gold in 12 days for the team.<br>- Earnings(gain) in Experience: 12 Experience a day and by Dinoz is 144 Experience in 12 days.<br>- Loss of Life: 1 Life by site for every leader thus 4 Life by dinoz at the conclusion of the Collection.<br><br>- Total for 3 Dinoz: 12 days of collection, 432 gained(won) Experience, 12 consummate Life and 10800 gained(won) Gold.<br><br><br>There is nothing to repeat(criticize): 4 supplementary days crossed(spent) in team bring back(report) 7200 Gold and 240 supplementary Experience! (Compared with 3600 Gold and 192 Experience in 8 days) and an economy of 24 Life.<br>He(It) is worth it thus widely more to drag little because we get back this time(weather) by advancing(moving) more in Experience and by gaining(winning) much more Gold (with, once again, the activation in groups them of 3, the 1 % of luck(chance) to gain(win) more than 10 000 Gold).<br><br>And when there are no enemies to kill (Collections of the "mongrel", the " fresh(cool) fish ") it is even more profitable because the time(weather) is the same that if you made him(it) individual (because every Dinoz can validate the same day the discussion with Madam Seyche or Madam Ducraft).<br><br>It is possible that you have different results(profits) according to teams of 2 or 4, levels and collections (in case of levels Different the opponents correspond to Dinoz of the highest level, thus attention on Life of your weakest level if it is him who leads the team because it is always the leader who drinks in 1st!).<br><strong><u>The Sticky Swamp:</u></strong><br><br>Check we often speak about it, and we find that almost everywhere, but as we say, it is better to repeat than to take the risk of not having been heard(understood), thus here is the Phases of the Swamp, according to days:<br><br>On Monday: normal <br>On Tuesday: normal <br>On Wednesday: no fight (Fog) <br>On Thursday: no movement (Flood) <br>On Friday: normal <br>On Saturday: no movement (Flood) <br>On Sunday: no fight (Fog) <br>The Movements can thus be made there on Monday, on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.<br>The Fights (Missions in particular) can be made on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, there Friday and Saturday.<br><strong><u>The Tournament of Forcebrut:</u></strong><br><br>Craftiness to gain(win) many Experience is the Tournament of Forcebrut. Indeed, successful Experience is not received by defeated Dinoz but at time when " Reward for Victoire ", and the same if he is posted on the screen of fight as any common reward.<br><br>But what that changes then?<br><br>And indeed for example, that changes totally the interest of certain skills such as Black Hole, which normally, annihilates the enemy in 1 blow, but does not give you Experience. And very there YES!<br>The Tournament is not evident for Dinoz which begins, and as it is simpler to make Grandpa - Joe's missions for Experience, it is better to dash into the Tournament, near the level 28-30, when Experience begins to miss, and when we made almost all the Missions (except Magnetic Steppes), and when to kill tiny creatures classic brings back(reports) only rarely more than 10 Experience, there we can take then easily more than 30 Experience by fight, what is very interesting at this moment there of the game!<br>OK, but, I reach it how in this Tournament?<br><br>And indeed for celà it is necessary first of all the Shovel, which we obtain in the Appearances(Mines) of Coral, on Islands Atlantéinées. Then we use him(it) to go to dig in Ruins Ashpouk, in the Any Big Warmth. What has the effect of digging up an Old woman Pierre.<br>There, we amènne the Hurdy-gurdy Pierre at The University and we show her(it) to the Professor Eugène, by asking him the question " This old stone ", it turns out while it is about "Totem Ashpouk", while the Professor puts back(hands) us then. And has to leave from there, it does not more remain than to go(surrender) to Forcebrut to join with the Organizer of the Tournament, and it left! With the rhythm Irma's Action Journalière/Potion by fight.<br><br><em>To be Continued...</em>
