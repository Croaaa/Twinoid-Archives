                After reading subject on new tamer market, I think it would be a good idea for DinoRpg to see how funding is working. Now, with needing ingredients for notes, it leaves it less desirable to join a clan because I am guessing you are expected to give your ingredients to the clan. Conidering that when you are in a clan you are buying <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> for warm bread and battle rations, I would think its a bad fiscal move for them. Looking at one comment of the thread, it still doesn't make sense. You can't give money to another account so even if you were to have 3 or 4 accounts,not one of them could transfer the earnings to the next..get me? What does it stop except not making it possible to get rid of say lvl 16 cloudoz and then using the funds to buy a level 15winks or a levl 16 winks and adding your own gold to it..see they stil get thier cut, noone is making money off the site. Ingredients had their place allready..for clans. This way takes the fun out of trading..it makes it a money deal Most gamers are into cards or like Magic you trade cards or 3 ok cards for 1 good card. Ther comes a point where one has to say 'Jeez I could pay $300 for a top video card and a  dope RPG/mp game and be ahead than this"

                God! (me!), three threads in one day.<br><br>lock this one too please.<br><br>It's probably not going to change, their are reasons its the way it is. <br><br>1. It's a good system to make money, anyone who wants to use the market needs to buy notes from MT. <br>2. It's stops a few ways people can multi.<br><br>However 1. Is more likely the main reason, Bot's could simply be put in place to stop multi'ing. IP Ban's and Ban's of Original Account's not just Multi Accounts would also go a long way to improving any Multi Problems their are.<br><br>History, Once upon a time you could change gold to notes directly, but people abused it to multi and now the system has been removed and MT allows Paying players to take full advantage of the market now. Everyone else is gimped a little, and its their own fault.

                I saw the example and there still lie the question HOW can you give your money/stuff to your  other account YOU CANT. if thatsthe excue it poor becaue you still need to get the coin to buy the note to buy the item. You sell you get the money and you cant give it away..see? So that leave only profit, but I believe it will take away clan membership and therefore be a LOSS to MP see my point? It also taeks away interest. you cant play,save coin and sell say a sirain so you can get a santaz egg. It allready is a burden wtih the time out, but for this to be a money game, leave much to be desired then. Plus if they had announced this, more peole would have bought notes during snowplough time,or at least not cashed in xtra notes. I mean think about it if you knew ahead of time that you were going to have to spend probably $50-_$100 to get every monster would you have even started playing? NO you probably would go to the game store and bought a top mp game. That alot of money for omething you cant even put in your hand. I almost did it for a kabuki and i ha to stop and go..$80 for a picture on my screen of a kabuki that doesnt even make noise when it does its thing?

But the changes suggested would open many ways to abuse the system again, so it wont change. Of cause MT also can make a little more money the way it works now, but who can blame them. <br><br>Also I dont really think many peaple eally considder changing ingredients for <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_tix.gif"> with this exchange rates and therefore it is not hurting the clans. I have accepted, that i wont be able to buy anything at the market, as im not spending money, and im fine with it. In nearly every browser game there are things you can only do when spending money, because the producers want to earn something, and im glad about how much you can do, how much you can achive in DinoRPG without ever spending money.

                Just because this is a "game" it doesn't mean this is a "hobby" for the creators of the game. It's free for people who don't want to pay to play. . .but it isn't just a site that exists for free.<br><br>There are costs involved. So it is "natural" that the game would be set up so that playing would have more appeal if you spent some money. That's just business. If you can't wrap your head around that. . .then you will never "get it."<br><br>Someone designed and spent time and effort on every graphic you see on this site. Someone is maintaining the servers, databases, tweeking code and adding more content. They are programmers, graphic designers etc. Should they spend hours on this for free? Maybe have a "real" (sarcasm here) job during the day and only work on this site on their "free time?"<br><br>This *is* their job and they have a right to expect that their efforts will somehow turn into profit. Otherwise, they'd shut this down and start on a new project.<br><br>This is most likely why the site will have a positive slant towards the money spending people. Justifiably so. You probably wouldn't do *your* job gratis either.<br><br>So no, it wouldn't be in their best interest to make it easier for people to "get out of" spending real money. <br><br>If you can't deal with it, you and all the other people who take issue with this should form a co-op of programmers, designers etc to do this for free so profit wouldn't be in issue. Also find someone who will give you the software needed to create a site like this for free. And maybe someone will throw in some free servers and talk to your ISP and see if they will give you unlimited free bandwidth for your site.

                Look, I'm sure theirs a game out their somewhere for you, where you don't have to pay anything to play it and you get as much of a lead as someone who does pay or someone who spends a lot of time playing it.<br>But this game isn't it, if you don't like the fact go play one of those rare game that meet your standards.<br>In fact why don't you learn everything about coding you can and make your own and then run your finances into the ground paying to keep your game running and keeping it updated.<br>Good Luck.

                Why dont you F-in READ before making accusations? Did I say everything us for free? And if you werent so pig headed, the last 2 of you to make comments, you would have shut the f up and read..I HAVE PAID BEFORE RETARD. Never said I hadnt, I read about treaury notes before  snowplough ever came around and I read about tarding for<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> I diodnt have that much<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> and I have put $ to get gold to play. What I said different that the other board poster is that ingredients are for clans, and would logically remove palyers who want to play the market from joining clans, unless you want to spend ungodly amounts. What 1st poster said is what i agreed with, would spent money on Notes during snowplow,had I known that I woul not be able to trade my $for notes.  Go ahead and go back in the NEWS , nothing about the change from cash to ingredients. YOu act if I was trying to get something for free your a dork that believes you can read minds. A market should be a place for trade and its not now, why read abunch of other crap into it?

                Your problem is with the fact that people who spend lot's of money of the game can use the market unrestricted where as you can not unless you spend lots of money on notes. If you want to change this you obviously have a problem with current process as you admit. You admit this and yet deny it. You are one confused individual. <br><br>If you want to play a game where you can trade without paying for the privelege I repeat even though it falls on deaf ears, Go play somewhere else. It has been explained time and time again. Let the matter drop. Mod's lock this repition thread that was locked twice already.<br><br>Also enjoy the ban when the mods get around to reading your swearing.
