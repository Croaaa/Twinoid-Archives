                <p>I decided to open new thread because this discusion may be quite off topic for Etherwasp thread. Also it may be interesting topic overall.<br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_895738 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="895738">sendos</span></span><cite><br>Highly debatable. The main uses for moueffes is lots of <img src="http://es.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_life.gif" alt=":drpg_vie:" class="tid_ico">, counter-attack and force control. With softpig, it's torch, lots of <img src="http://es.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_life.gif" alt=":drpg_vie:" class="tid_ico"> and counterattack. Quetzus are rather variable though. As for hippoclamps, I don't see them often in pvp, so you might be right there. As for glidwings, from experience, they rely solely on getting as much <img src="http://es.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif" alt=":drpg_foudre:" class="tid_ico"> as possible and hoping to deal as much damage as early as possible. Flight will enable them to divert tough assaults away from them and raijin, third to werewolf and fuijin, is still a reasonable invocation skill.<br><br>You could also add pteroz as one of the weakest dinoz around, too. I still field mine because it specialises in lots of initiative, hopefully doing as much damage as possible.</cite></p><p>I can't agree with some of these statements.</p><p><strong>Opinion1:</strong>Even though moueffes rely on high <img src="http://es.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_life.gif" alt=":drpg_vie:" class="tid_ico">, Softpigs may have nearly the same amount of<img src="http://es.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_life.gif" alt=":drpg_vie:" class="tid_ico">. Also if you manage to get 5 levelups in air before lvl 50, you will get the same amount of counterattack chance. But softpigs have much higher chances to build right way, because of quite high CP chance, especially it matters on 50+. Because of that, you can manage to get Force Control on softpigs so you get dinoz with slightly lower <img src="http://es.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_life.gif" alt=":drpg_vie:" class="tid_ico">, but much higher passive damage and atack power.</p><p>Actually the main con of Mousffe is low CP chance, so you can't customize your build at all. Because of that, higher air chance may be a problem too(especially in 50+ where there are no useful spells on low lvls in air). So potentially Softpigs are better, because their only con is low air chance and it can be countered by cube and cp(at least for top players).</p><p><strong>Conclusion1:</strong> Softpigs are potentially better but Moueffes still may be decent choice for newbies(even if they go wrong, they won't lose a lot of power). What about Quetzu, they are more like double element softpigs, but without counterattacks. Instead they have Acid Blood.</p><p><strong>Opinion2:</strong> What about Glidwings, they may be ok, but now they are still weaker than Rockys and Wanwans because of very high Air chance, that wastes too much lvlups. Even though invocation is quite strong, but in most cases it can't outdamage wanwans and rockys. Also if <em>Maradona's Feint</em> is good, there will be one more decent choice to build Glidwings so they are not <em>that</em> bad.</p><p><strong>Conclusion2:</strong> For now Glidwings are weaker than Rockys or Wanwans. But they may be good with new lightning spells.</p><p><strong>Opinion3:</strong> I agree pteroz are weaker than other dinoz in their original state, but they potentially can become the strongest one-vs-one dinoz if build right. They are one of the dinoz who can get max multihit chance and max counterattack chance along with torch. If you manage to get force control, pteroz may become <strong>deadly massacre machine</strong>. The only real problem is getting Sumo.</p><p><strong>Conclusion3:</strong> Pteroz still might be a good option since they may become perfect duelists thanks to high multihit and counteratack chance. Why they are risky team dinoz is because one lorie can destroy their teammates. Even though pteroz are not the best choice, but still they have their unique abilities. Moueffes/Hippoclamps don't have those unique abilities, since Moueffes are weaker version of Softpigs and Hippoclamps became just useless because of 50+ spells. What about Glidwings, their potential is not fully discovered, but now they look weaker, and adding some unique ability would be nice, even if it won't be too strong(maybe maradonas feint can become those ability).</p><div class="tid_sideNote"><strong>P.S.</strong>To clarify my statements, I talked about lvl 70 builds here(since it was proved that lvl 70 would exist).</div><p><span class="tid_strike"></span><span class="tid_strike"></span><span class="tid_strike"></span>--<br><br>I created this thread to answer Sendos post, but then I decided that it may be a good idea to create thread like this where people can discuss which dinoz are weaker and why or, maybe, why they are still strong.<br><br>To start with, I will argue about gorilloz.<br><br><strong>Opinion4:</strong> Gorilloz may become good dinoz with new spells. You can get a lot of wood rolls and make a quite strong dinoz with high initiative and speed(I would even suggest to get Brave, even though it may sound strange). <br>If you manage to get Sumo, you will get 400 hp dinoz with strong assaults, 20+ ini and high speed. In addition, if you get CP you can try rushing +30% multihit in fire so you will get 55% multihit chance with strong assaults. And the last but not least, you can get Berserk or even lvl 15 spell behind it(still nobody knows what it does) and double strength of your assaults, which will provide insane autoatacks damage and gorilloz cons(too much wood) can become their pros. <br>Since Berserk is E, Gorilloz still would be weak in TM-battles(but if you manage to get CP, Burning Fever and Sumo they will be stronger than average wanwans), but in classic battle they might become a huge threat(a lot of usefull e-spells, strong assaults, high speed and ini, tons of hp). And after using Berserk wooden assault may reach 500 damage(I think it's like 45+ damage from assault). Also since you would get a lot of wood rolls, you will need to get archeology to avoid slowing spells, so it will also provide high utility.<br>That's why I think gorilloz CAN be strong dinoz and challange with other dinoz pretty well(for now they are just as strong as wanwans considering they both get Sumo).<br>The main cons are: <br>1)very high wood chance and low water/lightning chance so getting Sumo can be a problem; <br>2)because of that it's very hard to grow up pre lvl50(if you won't get a Sumo, it will be totally useless in tm-battles and quite weak in classis battles).<br>I strongly appreciate if you will write here your suggestions about different dinoz that considered to be weak and suggestions why they are not that weak. Also you can ask here how weak dinoz can be turned in decent and quite strong dinoz. Will be glad to read your reviews about this.</p>

                <p>Well, there's a difference between "lucky" and "get Cp with a Feross". Lucky means get CP with it around level 40, but "get cp" means "get it soon enough that you have a significant control over it's path", like around level 20. Since every dinoz has at least 5% to get a lightning level up, if you are like "if you get cp with a feross", you can make any race become great, as you can get CP with any race then.</p><p>It is really hard to build a Feross, as it usually gets flooded with wood and some air (but not enough for bubble or vendetta). Building a Quetzu already has its tough choices and a well-built Feross is really similar tot that, except it has an even greater risk of getting overwhelming wood level-ups. I wouldn't even know what an "optimal" or "best" Feross build looks like...</p><p>I would probably call a race weak if even the best what they can do or get is way worse than another race's optimal (but not exceptional) build.<br>For example if you want a Pteroz, you can try as hard as you want, but you'll end up with a half-witted Softpig. It's also getting just like that with Kabukis, as try as hard as you wish, you'll either end up with a bubblewinks with more air and less water (which is bad), a cloudoz without Fujin (which is bad) or an Etherwasp without Hazard and a strong wood assault (which is not bad, but less powerful).</p><p>I would have been so happy, if demon Moueffes got an additional 5% counterattack chance, demonkabukis got an additional 5% chance to dodge, but no...</p><p>I can imagine a Gorilloz to be powerful, but it would need Sumo, Self-Control, CP and probably 0 air (or ET, but that's really stretching it) and that is a really hard to get build, even with a cube.</p><p>Castis became great with WW, Wanwans are great, Rockies are great, Winks' are the most durable and ancient choice (of mine <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> ), Cloudoz are now strong and Glids are too one-sided. Tofufus focus on too many things with little HP and Mahamutis are awesome but lack immunity to poison, are expensive to get and can be overwhelmed with wood-rolls. Finally, even the best Santaz possible is not nearly as strong as an Etherwasp can be on average.</p>

                <p>I think the air element is the weakest element, so the weakest dino should be a monochrom air -heavy dino: <strong>Santaz</strong><br>Even with CP, Earth tremor, sumo, invocation, immaterial form and new tree, Santaz is weak. Maybe if MT would change the poison -thing a bit, it could change. Monster hunt is the only reasion to keep Santaz IMO.</p>

Maybe if MT would change the poison -thing a bit, it could change. Monster hunt is the only reasion to keep Santaz IMO.</cite><p>Actually it's quite possible to get bubble on santaz(at least with Cube) so it may be very good dinoz, but I agree etherwasp is still better choice. I think poison rework may make santaz more usefull, but now even his invocation is bugged. Also immaterial form is bad choice for fighter santaz, because it weakens your dinoz too much. But santaz still may be good if they are not over-aired too much(I think they may be just as strong as Kabukis potentially).</p><p>I almost totally agree with Raynors post, his statements mostly similar to mine thoughts. But I can't agree with a few points.</p><p>As I already said pteroz may be built as max multihit-max counterattack machine, which may become strongest 1v1 dinoz so it's quite unique.</p><p>On my point Kabukis also need some buffs(maybe at least demon Kabukis, 5% dodje will be perfect, but something more unique will be great).</p><p>Also I agree that good gorilloz is very hard to get, but potentially it can be even stronger then wanwans or rockys so it can't be considered totally bad using your definition of bad dinoz.</p><p>What about feross, I've worked on it's build a lot and the best thing I managed to make is balanced feross(slightly higher fire, even water and wood with least possible air) with CP pre lvl 50 which would be used as leader for 6 dinoz group(it can get wooden leader spells and water lvl 50+ spell as well if it would have cp). But I agree it is VERY situational so only a few feross can totally follow it. Even though most of them can get core of this build(leading spells) that's why it's not that bad. Still I agree feross are not very good fighters.</p>

                <p>I also whant to notice that better way of improving game is not nerfing strong dinoz(like bubble winks) but buffing weaker dinoz(such as moueffes or hippos) and adding some unique stuff to every race (in addition to invocations). For example pteroz may be quite strong if built proper way, but Moueffes and Kabukis will anyway be weaker than Softpigs and Cloudoz/Etherwasps as Raynor said. So adding at least little buffs will help a lot and make them more popular. And adding unique ways of building them will be just perfect.</p><p>For example for Kabukis it may be a variant of Tofufu/Kabuki teams for max dodje but it's so unstable and very risky so nobody tried to make it(as I know), while dwinks are one of the easiest to build and one of the strongest dinoz for now. So who wants to risk trying to get phantom team while there are a lot of strong team compositions.</p><p>For Moueffes and Kabukis the best way in my opinion will be buffing their demon forms(maybe adding some unique skills like quetzu racial skills).</p><p>Also I think dinoz who need buff the most are Hippoclamps. With adding Invocations and 50+ spells they became so much weaker(since they have weak invocation and can't reach highest 50+ spells). Also force control makes them useless.</p>

                <p>I think adding items could be good for improving weak dinoz (I think there was a topic somewhere with great suggestions for new items), but as time goes, the number of items is the same and instead of adding some, we get skills that replace them. We had nimbao potions -&gt; skills and then caushemesh -&gt; nothing.</p><p>So if dinoz is weak, why not make an item, that will improve them in a way, that people would buy it and other dinoz would only get a small buff, so it won´t be worth it.</p><p>Anyways I can´t really hope to get a good dinoz, maybe decent one, because I´m a nonpayer and what I get is what I´ll have, so it is better for me to buy item, rather than training a new dinoz, because he gets a lot better, for example casti.

Your 5 really bad dinoz.</p></cite><p>It is not about bad dinoz but about hard ones.</p><p>There are quite a lot of Pteroz and Goriloz with Sumo in dinorpg. Also chance of getting bubble/sumo with Santaz is the same as getting Sumo with Gorilloz. During the time I playing that game I noticed that some dinoz lvlup in certain elements much more often then they should. So answering question about what is bad dinoz (at least for me) I will say that bad dinoz is dinoz that can't potentially be stronger than average dinoz in any role(moueffes are potentially weaker than softpigs and kabukis are potentially weaker than dwinks or cloudoz).</p><p>Using Venar's defination of bad dinoz Hippos are perfectly good now. But they are not.</p><p>What about percentages, I think "possible" number of levelups without CP is doubled percentage number. With Cp it's like tripled percentage number(for low percentages).</p><p>If you don't agree with this, tell me how then Sumo+Clones wanwans were grown? That's why I disagree with definition based on "how possible to get sumo/cp on this dinoz", but I offer definition "how strong will dinoz be if he get what he can get".</p><p>As I already mentioned for lots of players the game goal is not playing with mainstream dinoz(now those are dwinks) but to grow up strong dinoz that were considered to be weak(like strong pteroz or gorilloz or maybe santaz). Because it will be your own unique dinoz and you will be the only(or one of the few) owner of such a dinoz. This feeling is awesome.</p><p>I started this thread to find out dinoz that nobody wants to grow up so it may(and should) be buffed once in some way. Also I started it to help people find strengths of weaker dinoz to inspire utilising those strengths and growing up really unique and strong dinoz which they will be proud of.</p><p>But of course I don't force anyone to grow up those dinoz, you may just skip this and grow up a few more dwinks.</p><p>P.S. The only thing I don't understand is why Venar has lvl 60 pteroz and goriloz as well as lvl 51 santaz if they are so bad? Honesty I was inspired by him to grow up pair of dgorilloz when I saw them in his dojo. As well I was inspired by other top players to make such a dinoz as max-multihit-counterattack pteroz(Angurva) or Bubbled santaz(i'm sorry, but I don't remember where I've seen one of this). I discovered their potential only when I saw them in top players dojos. This is one more reason why I started this thread, I hoped to hear some statements from top players why growing up those dinoz may be good. But I also was glad to confirm my information why it is bad(low lightning/water chance).</p><p>In conclusion I want to provide my list of weakest races:<br>1.Hippoclamp(overall weak, became useless after caushmesh launch).<br>2.Moueffe(overall weaker than Softpigs, in addition have low CP chance).<br>3.Feross(maybe hardest dinoz to build, BUT they are one perfect race for new generation of leaders).<br>4.Glidwings(they look much weaker than Rockys/Wanwans for now, but they might be quite good(unique) pure lightning casters(still they don't pierce through bubble)).<br>5.Kabukis(they are not very weak and still used in competitive matches but the only pros they have over other bubble dinoz are their outfit and slightly higher dodje chance; but they got nothing unique with 50+ launch and got no power increase at all).<br><span class="tid_sideNote">Almost the same problem with wanwans but they got force control at least which made them quite competitive.</span></p><p>About glidwings. I need to say that those updates(new magic items/invocations/caushmesh) have done what it should've, I mean made some weaker races stronger, but it also made some races that were OP(lightning based dinoz in particular) too weak in their original state because from 4 discovered skill trees lightning tree is the worst and have no really unique spells. In addition, lightning casters were already weaker than bubble dinoz so it made them even more weaker. But Wanwans and Rockys may get more fire and wood instead and become quite strong. Glidwings have low fire and wood chances and air tree have no good spells at all(at least on low levels) so Glidwings are forced to get as much lightning as possible(and all those useless e spells).</p><p>The reason why I consider Kabukis, Santaz and Glidwings not that weak as Moueffe or Hippos is because they still have their unique builds and there are some unknown spells that MAY make them a little bit stronger(such as maradonas feint that perfectly fits on glidwings and all those air lvl 15 spells for Kabuki and Santaz). But if all those spells are useless, you can freely consider them as weak dinoz.</p><p><strong>Thank you all for feedback on that topic, will be glad to read even more<img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></strong></p>

Sure you shouldn't try to build bubble on santaz if you got first water on lvl 20. But there seems to be tendency when some dinoz "like" certain elements and they get higher chance to get it. Maybe I'm wrong but it's only my observations from hundreds dinoz I've seen.</p><p>Talking that you never do what they can't you gave wrong examples. Clones are totally real on castivorous(but simply pointless due to TM).

I agree with you in most cases but just want to find out full potential of those "weakest races". That's why I will be glad to hear from you and anyone else some ideas how they can be utilized and built as truly unique and usefull dinoz worth levelling. Also it will be nice to hear ideas how those dinoz may be improved.</p>

My Pteroz Luka has 26% of the counter-attack, but I rarely see them<img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":tid_sad:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>About pterozes: Firstly when I started playing, I liked their look. And I thought they were strong dinoz, till I knew that in the game against other dinoz your life is important. Pteroz difficult to get a sumo, but in addition to this complexity they have a plus - variants of growth. You can come up with different directions in all the elements, except water. For example, to take or not Waikikido on fire, try to take Sprint, in lightning you can choose way to Overload or Blazing Twillight or take only Career Plan and Hazard (or only a career), in wood you can go to Wild Instinct for Earth Tremor, or choose more classic way.<br>And yes, growing less popular dino gives more fun if you can get a good result<img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":tid_razz:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Just because they are rare I guess no one really bothers with them, but it seems like mahamutis could be decent in PvP. Wipeout penetrates bubble, they have 10% lightning for CP, easy sumo and life source + force control in the new skill tree. I guess they aren't so good because of lack of antipoison, but if in an environment with items poisonite could fix that. It is possible i'd say to get bubble on them, but who wants to spend hundreds of notes on mahas to have that chance? If you go for Life Guard and Acid Blood you could get 3-4 damage depending on more or less water. Now, the thing with wood is that they would be decent having vines + primal state + summoning skills if you like in a no-item fight, he wouldn't have poison potection unless primal state triggered a lot (I don't know how often it does). They have the potential to penetrate bubble with Rock Thrower and Acorn Thrower. Abyss helps against non-more-than-10-water dinoz like softpigs and pteroz (affects force control?) and marine vitality is there to have more HP.</p><p>Now because this isn't about strong races, i'll ask about Tofufus. Their problem is shared with wans, sumo. Lots of air means definite Life Breath. I don't know what else to go for in air, maybe dodge, or go for vendetta because of 10% fire and CP. Maybe overload as well, try to make him a countering + multihit dinoz? I've also seen some vivacious wind tofufus around. Looks like a lot of possibilities on lightning, leafy dawn+shock, overload and CP, or try to just go for career plan to put as much damage into Earth Tremor as possible. Other than acrobat+growth and maybe earth tremor, I don't see much else to go for in wood until new skill tree for force control (interesting idea, force control + vendetta + overload and double hit) I really just want to know what other people think about tofufus.</p>

Also bubble chance is not that low, most of top Mahamutis I saw had bubble. But even without bubble they are still very strong dinoz with biggest aoe damage in the game. In addition they have tons of HP and quite high passive damage from acid blood and life source. Also there are perfect magic item just for Mahamuti and Dwinks named Antidot.</p><p>What about Tofufus, for now they look just like weaker versions of wanwans. But they have advantage of Earth Tremor and their god that can be utilized well with Kabuki teams. But for now there is no such teams on this server so we can't speak about how strong they really are.</p>
