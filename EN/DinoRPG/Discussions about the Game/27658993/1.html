                <p>Hello all. I'm breaking my forum hiatus to talk and launch the discussion about what I believe that can be beneficial for the growth of this server. I also play in french and spanish servers, and what I see in there is a much bigger community than ours. This sounds odd to me, since english is the most spoken language in the world. This can be because of marketing reasons where only MT can help themselves. But I believe there is some we can do, and today I want to speak about what we can lobby to happen and help this community grow. This is just my opinion about just 2 matters, but please feel free to add more, if you feel like it.</p><p>First and foremost: wars. What I'm currently seeing in spanish server is a total dedication by most clans that are participating in the mana war, even if they are weaker and don't have much chance for a "napodino prize" position. I'm talking of about at lest 50-60 clans actively participating in the war. To be sure, our server doesn't have this numbers of clans (or players) to be equal to this, but I wonder of how many clans have been destroyed for the rules of our wars, where only top20 is properly rewarded with napos. This forces players that outgrow their clan to leave their weaker clan in order to keep evolving, this forces clans to merge together, I'm sure we all know examples of this, but bottom line, we are reducing our "war community" to 25-30 clans (cotc may have some more), and I believe this is forced right away by the long-term prizes structure that we have. Big clans keep getting bigger, and weak clans remain weak, unless a big effort (€€€) is done to change that. Some clans could still be operating if they had a better growth perspective than they have at the present, but instead they were forced to merge with some other clan or just get absorbed by another. And players that left their weaker clans so they could keep growing, would all still do that if they could get a decent prize in their clan?</p><p>So, I think we can lobby to change this. Even if only top30 at first, even if the clans that do get a top30/top40 seem "unworthy" of a napo, Rome wasn't built on a day and I think we can call it a long term plan, to give time for clans to be created and grow and have a better long term perspective. There are more ideas that can be given for there to be more clans (reducing number of members, change some war rules, etc), but I believe this wouldn't be one of the easiest and most effective ways.</p><br><p>Secondly, I would like to ask the moderators to rethink the forum they have "created". I see a much more participated forum in the other servers, and again, more players obviously means more participation, but in my opinion you also are responsible for the forum, and you keep locking newbies threads and telling them to use other threads with pages and pages of information that they may not understand or need at all. And some do use them, but not all, or else that page would be overcrowded and impossible to follow. Why don't just let people create their own threads and get their own personal attention? Why is that so bad? If they ask a thing that has been questioned a thousand times before, well, they have the doubts everyone had, what is the big deal? Just let someone answer it for the thousandth time and incentive them to put up more questions they might have, not locking them out and telling them to use a page that is overcrowded with discussions which half of newbies won't get. People need to start with baby steps in a new game, and you're just shutting them up, and in my opinion that is not good. And it's not only them you're shutting up, but also other people, moving and editing their threads, locking because from your perspective isn't worth being open... Well, I say any discussion is better than none and what isn't interesting to you can be to someone else. I prefer a more lively forum with some "disorganization", than having everything "perfectly" placed, but no one paying them much attention. And then there are bans, bans, and bans, bans for everyone and everything, and I can just feel that you do it because you just feel that because you can then you have to. No. Don't drive people away from the forum.</p>

                <p>The first issue is a complex problem. I wouldn't have a problem extending the prize structure to get smaller clans involved, but the real problem is that probably 75% of the top players are stacked in 3-4 clans.</p><p>As for the 2nd point, I agree 100% and have been thinking the same to myself for a while. The search function is aweful, and 90% of previous threads are locked or unbearable to read through anyways. I check the forums a couple times a week, but there is really not much being said. Anything to breathe some life into these forums is a plus, in my opinion.</p>

It is too constricted and mods give very little space for a thread to not be locked. In my opinion a forum should have less intervention from mods, who should be there only to edit/erase forbidden words/topics (spoilers, politics, religion, porn, something about a mineral agriculture...), disrespects, non-english posts and not much more. Not to say the general questions and other similar threads can't be kept, but still other smaller ones could be more tolerated.</p>

                <p>The nail on the head Hugo... The question is, what can be done about it? About the first issue: making big monster clans less attractive could be one way to do it I guess. Allowing people to grow faster is another way (the elite would crumble away, more or less, as they still have the means for that 'perfect' build).</p><p>About your second part: the mods have a hard time to stay friendly at times I think, but I never really think much of it, as it probably comes from thoughts being' lost in translation', be it French or German. There is also the cultural barrier, as some things can be seen as rude in a French culture, but not at all in a Russian or Scandinavian culture. That being said, we had a guy in my clan that gave up on this game because he felt he was bullied by a mod.</p><p>Mods have a difficult 'job', as they do this voluntarily. We should all thank them for the good job they are in fact doing. Some take themselves a tad bit to serious though, the community isn't that big that it needs the severe police-ing it sometimes is subjected to (only refering to newbie question in this instance).</p>

Mods just do the job they think they are supposed to be doing, which is good in some places. If you want this game to grow with more people and a bigger community, you can't just tell people to shut up. Think about it, a lot of people don't like reading long lists and as the search doesn't work very well, they might try to look at General Questions. All they see is a bunch of words that new people will not understand. Is there something wrong with having a topic that has been answered before brought back? I'm sure some people want to have lively discussions about builds and leveling guides outside of their clan or that specific topic. I'm not trying to accuse the mods of doing a bad job, just offering an opinion to change how they do it.</p>

                <p>FR/ES forums have a different forums structure which separated newbies from (more or less) experienced players.

And when they do the same on the "experienced" players forum, they got trolled/bashed too...</p><p><span class="tid_mod">Clarification:<br>- A topic which leads to debate stay opened (occasionally locked due to severe trolling).<br>- A topic which is only one question, and also only one answer possible. That topic get locked since Q&amp;A is a whole topic about one question being answered by one answer.<br><br>Being newbie or not have nothing to do with this.</span></p><p>By the way, check which player(s) tried to heavily structured the forums before crying on the mods do this, do that. I know we're an easy target, but frankly, I don't know by how large you miss that one.</p>

Or, maybe they don't know if their question would cause debate or not. True, they should use the Q&amp;A. They could not know about it. And maybe, like I was a while ago, they were trying to be helpful and report spelling mistakes, where the rightful place to do so HAS NO TITLE. It's confusing at first especially if this is the first time they have been around a forum. Again, why is it bad if they create a topic and we answer? The question could have multiple answers, it could have one answer and it could cause a debate they have no idea and neither do we until they ask it. Them starting a new thread and posing a question isn't hindering us, and it's helping new people figure out the game.</p>

                <p>Not sure I agree about the war thing. The number of active clans is a direct function of the number of active players. Each top clan can only have 50 members. If players are constantly jumping ship to the top clans, that's a sign that the top clans are losing players.</p><p>As for the forum - 100% agree. This forum is so over-moderated it's unbelievable. I don't know who is to blame. Maybe it's the moderators, or maybe it's the people creating the rules that the mods are following, or maybe it's a combination of the two. Whichever way you look at it, all the fun, all the life, all the interest has been completely sapped out of the forum.</p>

                <p>My 2 cents about community size:</p><p>- this game's salt and pepper are war and championship<br>- championship is more successful because of the leagues. there is room for small clans in the mid and small league to fight on their own level.<br>- war would be the other best thing, but there is no perfect rule that would protect the small clans from being massacred by bigger ones. the most annoying thing is when a clan is in fight with other 2-3-5 clans on their level, then a bigger (not even a top1-5 but, one from about 5-6 places higher) come, and ruins their efforts. that's really demoralizing and killing the game on the long run..<br>- sadly this community have this much attention only from MT. if there would have been much more players, a bigger community, then it would be worthy for MT to take attention, but I dont see this coming.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>-d2k-</p>

                <p>EN server isn't populated the way you're thinking it is. It's more an international server than an entirely English-only one.

                <p>Kayin, you may not have been the creators of the rules that keep the forum this way, but you sure are the keepers and enforcers of those rules, and would I be wrong to say you could change it if you agreed to?</p><p><cite>Not sure I agree about the war thing. The number of active clans is a direct function of the number of active players. Each top clan can only have 50 members. If players are constantly jumping ship to the top clans, that's a sign that the top clans are losing players.</cite></p><p>This is a good perspective, indeed a reason why people keep moving from weaker to stronger clans is also because those stronger clans keep having spots available, but that's because there are 50 spots available and it's only natural that out of 50 someone quits the game eventually. 50 is very big number to fill all with very active players that will never leave. The other reason in my opinion, is that accustomed to this, top clans mostly only accept strong players, because they know they can. Until there were not much more stronger players incoming from weaker clans, and thus some clans started accepting newbies. That's what I think that could happen eventually in most clans if stronger players remained in their original clans: stronger clans would have to start recruiting newbies to fill their spots. It would either be that or no one. And that would also be good for the community, in my opinion... Because right now, unless you have some connection to some player, you need to start on a low clan (unless you join the 3-4 top clans that accept newbies, but they don't have infinite spots either) and your growth perspective will be very slow, and that can only give a tendency for new players to get bored and leave. Especially when they see their clan getting crushed by clans above, like Druid said. But if we start rewarding top30 properly (not just some demon tickets like last time, but a napo), that would give them more satisfaction, make all the defeats worth it, basically feeling better about the game. In the first few wars with this prize structure maybe people would feel that some clans didn't quite deserve such prize, but I think this can have some impact on the long term to help clans grow and attract more players (to stay and not quit).</p>

                <p>I consider myself one of the "newer players" having only played for almost 3 years (I'm the 5th newest account in my clan). One of the things I found most intimidating when starting this game, was reading about these events called Clan Wars and these fabulous gold coins called Napodinos, and then discovering they were only available for Clans that scored 20th or better.</p><p>Doing a bit of further research, I found out that the Top 20 almost all had requirements like high tier gatherers, or at least 3 level 30's. The hill just seemed too steep. When I do reach a higher clan, how am I supposed to compete the first few events without this so-called Antichromatic item that is required for PvP?</p><p>It may be better now, because there are some Top 20 clans that have very low requirements, as well as requirements being easier to teach due to new released content, but this was how I felt coming into the game. Giving an extra 10 spots Napos would immensely help the game seem more welcome to newcomers in my opinion.</p>

                <p>I can also confirm from the perspective of a newer player at the time, I left a smaller clan (Umpa Lumpa) to join LOoT purely becuase of the Napo situation. Back then I was the strongest player in Umpa and no matter how many coins I spent on Wars we just couldn't win any Napo's, finishing 21st even in one War that I recall. The frustration of not being able to compete with players who had numerous magic items was too great and I left the clan.</p><p>Now don't get me wrong, I'm very happy in LOoT and so glad that I did move on. Things are much more fun when you're winning prizes and have fellow like minded and active members. But my point is I wouldn't have even thought about moving clan if it wasn't for the fact that we never won any Napo's. I still think lowering clan sizes (20 members) will make a huge difference to the fun levels of clan events, but too many people are against it. Maybe when/if the game becomes an app for smart phones (readthe latest news before bashing this statement) it will help us increase active player numbers <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> There are LOTS of pay to win app games that have thousands and thousands of paying players, lets steal some of them onto drpg!<img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>On the other issue of forum moderation, I've gotta say I agree to an extent. It's a personal example to follow sure, but I had a thread locked that was created to advertise being at the superdome looking for fights. I recieved a warning and was re-directed to post in a thread that hadn't been used in well over 1.5 years! That's the sort of pedantic moderation that is frustrating and discourages posting on the forum. Starting a new thread is surely better than necroposting from over a year ago? Anyway I digress as that is a personal issue like said, just overall though things do seem a bit strict to the extent I rarely post anything to avoid the hassle of locked threads and deleted posts....</p><p>These are of course my opinions only <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Drunkenbob gives the perfect example of what I mean. In english server i was lucky enough to be in one of the first and good clans, that almost always got top20. But I remember a period of LBT that was less good, where we had to spend tons of gold on CW3 to get top20, and didn't participate at all on CW4, just to save coins to evolve, since top20 was unreachable without a huge cost, and below there just wasn't a good enough prize. I can understand the frustration that could be fighting over and over and not get that napo, it's the kind of frustration that make clans avoid clan wars.</p><p>But on Spanish server, since it gives a good prize for top40, you can be in a "smaller" clan (let's say some masters on levels 40-50 and little to none above 50) and still hope for a good prize, and so you can enjoy clan wars without fear of being outclassed by all clans with many level 50+, and be left out of a prize. I just think this could be an incentive for more clans to be formed and grow, and not force good players to leave those clans into others.</p>

                <p>I think that most english dominated country (england, US and Canada)'s population have better computers and internet access and connections. And thus players are more prone to play online on the PSNetwrok or XBox or regular intenet MMOs then play Flash Games.<br>I'm sorry, but Flash Game base games are the poor child of video gaming, and are usually reserved for work or an internet too laggy to play real time.</p>

                <p>I don't know why other servers are more populated exactly, but I need to say that English server is much more polite than others(maybe I'm wrong). So forums on English server are much more enjoyable to discuss things then other server forums.</p><p>The only bad thing about those forums is <strong>bad </strong>search system. I mean really bad. <strong>So the best way to improve forum system is improving search system</strong>.</p><p>Also it may be good to make a huge ingame FAQ system(the original help is very poor and uninformative, and now it seems to be broken), which will have the information about all the events and maybe even quests that were launched long time ago.</p><p>But the problem is, that for MT it's not best choice in terms of money, because it's better for them when players make mistakes and spend more money for additional irmas to correct those mistakes(like with Mandragora in Dinoplaza, etc.). That's why something like that would never be introduced. And that's why every good clan has it's own information system and forums to provide players with information and prevent them from wasting their time and money.</p><p>What about how to improve clans participation rate, I have an idea about complexive alliance system, and soon I'n going to describe it in additional thread(because it may be slightly off-topic). The main idea is decreasing clan size to 30, but instead adding solid alliances and leagues to war. In addition, it should be added Alliance Rankings, where the main prizes would be given and separated league rankings with lower prizes. In this way little leaguse clans in alliance with stronger clans will get almost the same amount of napos as bigger clans.</p><p>Now I need to go, but in a few hours I will explain my full vision of this system.</p>
