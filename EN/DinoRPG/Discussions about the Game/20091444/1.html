Switch off all A- , E- skills with strength under 90 or under strength of your strongest assault. <br>Switch off Detonation, Stumbs, Good Whack and Flood if it does small damage, all those skill eat your energy out very fast in solo fight and you get few attacks from Venerable in raw after that. <br>Vaporous form dinoz beware, triggering of VF negates all refrigerator shields bonuses. So switching off sapper and/or taking more shields can be useful.<br>Low level dinoz can try to use monos and pills. Vines helps. Not forget to switch off other not needed skills that can eat your energy like primal state.<br><em>Best time to kill</em> Better to do this before lvl 51 cause it was reported the xp drops a lot (from around 1k to 500). It is also a good way to get additional lvl on dinoz that are supposed to be sacrificed or on dinoz that should be reincarnated.<br><em>XP</em> 1k before lvl 51, 500 after lvl 51?

Usually group of 3 lvl 43 dinoz has no problems with Morg. <br><em>Best time to kill</em> As soon as you hit lvl 43, when you stop grinding on Summit and change to upper Nimbao.<br><em>Best possible group size</em> unknown<br><em>XP</em> 3x43 without prof and intelligence 900 xp</p><p><strong>Mutated Morg</strong><br><em>Second encounter</em> Path to the palace. During the second part of Nimbao quest (Quetzu Quest).<br><em>Attack</em> aoe<br><em>Immune to</em> Petrification<br>Not poison immune not immune to slow.<br> <em>Hints</em> equip 3 BR or survival kits and pill. Mono if you have problems, fight in group. Switch off all A- , E- skills with strength under 90.

But since that was only one dino, that could've been coincidence. Exactly 143 hp to my not fully healed wanwan does seem a bit suspicious though... And when my Gorilloz with 270hp was attacked, he also got hit for exactly 270 hp, but i cannot remember whether that was by belius or taurus...</p>

Switch off all A- , E- skills with strength under 90 or under strength of your strongest assault. <br>Switch off Detonation, Stumbs, Good Whack and Flood if it does small damage, all those skill eat your energy out very fast in solo fight and you get few attacks from Venerable in raw after that. <br>Vaporous form dinoz beware, triggering of VF negates all refrigerator shields bonuses. So switching off sapper and/or taking more shields can be useful.<br>Low level dinoz can try to use monos and pills. Vines helps. Not forget to switch off other not needed skills that can eat your energy like primal state.<br><em>Best time to kill</em> Better to do this before lvl 51 cause it was reported the xp drops a lot (from around 1k to 500). It is also a good way to get additional lvl on dinoz that are supposed to be sacrificed or on dinoz that should be reincarnated.<br><em>XP</em> 1k before lvl 51, 500 after lvl 51? (lvl 49 with prof without intelligence got 1050)</p><p><strong>Morg</strong><br>You will encounter Morg 2 times.<br><em>First encounter</em> Summit of Everwest.

Since he has usual attack it is a good idea to equip up to 4 flamelets and one BR. Usually group of 3 lvl 43 dinoz has no problems with Morg. Do not forget to switch off other not needed skills that can eat your energy like primal state.<br><em>Best time to kill</em> As soon as you hit lvl 43, when you stop grinding on Summit and change to upper Nimbao.<br><em>Best possible group size</em> unknown<br><em>XP</em> 3x43 without prof and intelligence 900 xp</p><p><strong>Mutated Morg</strong><br><em>Second encounter</em> Path to the palace.

Mono if you have problems, fight in group. Switch off all A- , E- skills with strength under 90 or under strength of your strongest assault. Vines helps. Do not forget to switch off other not needed skills that can eat your energy like primal state.<br><em>Best time to kill</em> Unknown, maybe before you go to Caushemesh. At lvl 45-48. Or earlier if you want to buy qeutzu. <br><em>Best possible group size</em> unknown<br><em>XP</em> 3x45-47 without prof and intelligence got 1125 xp</p><p><strong>Rapacarapace</strong><br><em>First encounter</em> Sticky Swamp<br>Attack usual and aoe<br>Immune to petri?<br>Can be poisoned.<br>Can be killed by trio of lvl 35 dinoz.<br>XP poor (9xp for 3x45 lvl)</p><br><p><strong>Encounters with Dark Dinoz</strong><br>Switch on only strong A skills and use 3-4 lories and 2-1 flamelets.

Switch off all A- , E- skills with strength under 90 or under strength of your strongest assault. <br>Switch off Detonation, Stumbs, Good Whack and Flood if it does small damage, all those skill eat your energy out very fast in solo fight and you get few attacks from Venerable in raw after that. <br>Vaporous form dinoz beware, triggering of VF negates all refrigerator shields bonuses. So switching off sapper and/or taking more shields can be useful.<br>Low level dinoz can try to use monos and pills. Vines helps. Not forget to switch off other not needed skills that can eat your energy like primal state.<br><em>Best time to kill</em> Better to do this before lvl 51 cause it was reported the xp drops a lot (from around 1k to 500).

                <p>So here it is, the final information I can give on the MI Guardian, as I attacked and beat him today on Spanish server:</p><p>His AoE does not pierce immaterial. He cycles the elements in his claw attacks and will finally hit air, removing you from immaterial.</p><p>He will curse you at the end, whether you have self-control or not, and it does not "bug" the fight requiring Epoq to fix things.</p><p>All-in-all, he is actually a fairly tough boss fight for level 30ish dinoz. I hope that this helps with the final description for the summary.</p>

                <p>I am going to do a new info tab for our clan and put there hints for different boss fights. Please share your knowledge on subject.</p><p><strong>Venerable</strong><br>Beware it is always 1 vs 1 fight.<br><em>Location</em> Venerable's lair<br><em>Immune to</em> Petrification<br>Not immune to poison.<br><em>Attack</em> aoe<br><em>Hints</em> equip 3 refrigerated shield (Can be bought in shop by Forges) and 2 BR or survival kits. Switch off all A- , E- skills with strength under 90 or under strength of your strongest assault. <br>Switch off Detonation, Stumbs, Good Whack and Flood if it does small damage, all those skill eat your energy out very fast in solo fight and you get few attacks from Venerable in raw after that. <br>Vaporous form dinoz beware, triggering of VF negates all refrigerator shields bonuses. So switching off sapper and/or taking more shields can be useful.<br>Low level dinoz can try to use monos and pills. Vines helps. Not forget to switch off other not needed skills that can eat your energy like primal state.<br><em>Best time to kill</em> Better to do this before lvl 51 cause it was reported the xp drops a lot (from around 1k to 500). It is also a good way to get additional lvl on dinoz that are supposed to be sacrificed or on dinoz that should be reincarnated.<br><em>XP</em> 1k base XP before lvl 51, 800 base XP at lvl 51 <a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/d98O0g/44">source</a></p><p><strong>Morg</strong><br>You will encounter Morg 2 times.<br><em>First encounter</em> Summit of Everwest.

Since he has usual attack it is a good idea to equip up to 4 flamelets and one BR. Usually group of 3 lvl 43 dinoz has no problems with Morg. Do not forget to switch off other not needed skills that can eat your energy like primal state.<br><em>Best time to kill</em> As soon as you hit lvl 43, when you stop grinding on Summit and change to upper Nimbao.<br><em>Best possible group size</em> unknown<br><em>XP</em> 3x43 without prof and intelligence 900 xp</p><p><strong>Mutated Morg</strong><br><em>Second encounter</em> Path to the palace.

Since being cursed is mandatory, don't go there with self-control dinoz or else getting stuck and have to PM Epoq to get the curse on.<br>Alternative: Recent info from .es server: <br>He will curse you at the end, whether you have self-control or not, and it does not "bug" the fight requiring Epoq to fix things.</p><br><p><strong>Encounters with Dark Dinoz</strong><br>This fight can be done in group (group leader and other dinoz should have an active turn and group leader initiate the fight).</p><p>Switch on only strong A skills and use 3-4 lories and 2-1 flamelets.

Switch off all A- , E- skills with strength under 90 or under strength of your strongest assault. <br>Switch off Detonation, Stumbs, Good Whack and Flood if it does small damage, all those skill eat your energy out very fast in solo fight and you get few attacks from Venerable in raw after that. <br>Vaporous form dinoz beware, triggering of VF negates all refrigerator shields bonuses. So switching off sapper and/or taking more shields can be useful.<br>Low level dinoz can try to use monos and pills. Vines helps. Not forget to switch off other not needed skills that can eat your energy like primal state.<br><em>Best time to kill</em> Better to do this before lvl 51 cause it was reported the xp drops a lot (from around 1k to 500). It is also a good way to get additional lvl on dinoz that are supposed to be sacrificed or on dinoz that should be reincarnated.<br><em>XP</em> 1k base XP before lvl 51, 800 base XP at lvl 51 <a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/d98O0g/44">source</a></p><p><strong>Morg</strong><br>You will encounter Morg 2 times.<br><em>First encounter</em> Summit of Everwest.

This attack removes immaterial status dealing 1 damage and penetrates bubble doing full damage.<br><em>Hints and info</em> equip 3 refrigerated shield (Can be bought in shop by Forges) and 2 BR or survival kits. Switch off all A- , E- skills with strength under 90 or under strength of your strongest assault. <br>Switch off Detonation, Stumbs, Good Whack and Flood if it does small damage, all those skill eat your energy out very fast in solo fight and you get few attacks from Venerable in raw after that. <br>Vaporous form dinoz beware, triggering of VF negates all refrigerator shields bonuses. So switching off sapper and/or taking more shields can be useful.<br>Low level dinoz can try to use monos and pills. Vines helps. Not forget to switch off other not needed skills that can eat your energy like primal state.<br><em>Best time to kill</em> Better to do this before lvl 51 cause it was reported the xp drops a lot (from around 1k to 500).

The Relaxative Pill really helped a lot since he made only 6 attacks all against korgons that I had called up.</p>

                <p>I dont see anything wrong in getting defeated with such a team (average below 45), against <strong>the</strong> highest top tier boss avaiable so far, in a quest that ultimately aims for lvl 50-60 dinoz. Its not like this is a hardcore ladder in some hack and slay game. You die but can try again. I dont think that there needs to be a warning, reminding you that you are doing a high level quest and are about to fight a "overly strong" boss.</p>

                <p>Actually I was referring to the characteristics of Taurus, a bad demon that no one realized he can be so strong. The 1st Taurus encounter was when Bao Bob takes him out after ones dinoz were killed in the Atlanteid Island area. So a player cannot measure his true power. Now Sofia another Guardian puts just a mediocre fight against the same opponent that the 1st Guardian took out like blowing away a lighted candle.</p>

                <p>I understand, and in that case, you are right. But still, the first encounter is a tutorial where you even get ressurected when you die. The next (2) are during the games endgame-content, so i think this is ok, once you think about it. But i understand that it feels strange to get "trashed" by the one who got "trashed" before.</p>

                <p>I fought mutated Morg today. Team of 3 with levels 48/48/47. They got 378/378/370 base <img src="http://es.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_xp.gif" alt=":drpg_exp:" class="tid_ico">. I'm sure if they all had been either 47 or 48 they would have gotten 375 each.</p><p>It seems to me there is a mechanism installed by MT that gives a bit more XP to higher levels and a bit less to lower levels if there is a difference in a group to avoid high level dinos 'dragging' lower levels through high XP locations (like I have seen in Diablo 2, a low level character leveling like every 15 seconds because of being dragged by a high level group).</p>

                <p>Idk if anyone has asked this, what happens if you beat the Korgon Avengers before they can curse you? Any information on exp or if Immaterial status blocks the curse effect. I assume that by the time you can 1 hit kill the big korgon the exp will be almost minimal but it'd be nice to know if anyone ever killed the thing. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>It is possible not to get cursed, but the xp isn´t worth mentioning even on the level you normally do the mission. Or at least I already killed them once without getting my dinoz cursed. I fought 3 times (for all dinoz in my group) and managed to get only 2 of them cursed from all 3 fights, so it´s not that hard.</p>

I also made an extra page for so called "minor bosses". Those are the ones that don't give much XP, but are unique enough to be of interest (at least to me). You can either meet them once during a quest (like Nox) or with every dino (like Elements or the Tower Guardian).</p><p>The document is read only, but you can copy all data as you like. If you want to contribute and help gathering XP data, please either post here in this thread, or - in case of minor bosses - send a PM to me, so that this topic does not get too cluttered.</p><p>Please report only XP for either a fight with a single dino or with groups of the same level. Groups with mixed levels are too bothersome to keep track of, as there are almost limitless combinations. Don't forget to include any applicable XP modifiers you had in the fight (Prof, Int, Encyclopedia) and make sure you did not hit a level up border.</p><p>Here is the link to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zkEC42sU1SiV-SnhkCVanLovFjN_2bGG4a72QorvNP4/edit?usp=sharing">Boss Fight XP doc</a>. It will be updated from this thread, my own little data base, and any input I get from contributors. For some opponents there is no info yet, because I once had it but then deleted it after the XP boost.</p>

                <p>So while the fight info about bosses should still be valid, you can scratch all the XP data collected so far. All servers (with the possible exception of the DE server) had another XP boost with the introduction of the new content. It seems not as big as the first one was, but still its enough to make all the old XP data obsolete.</p><p>While this is good news for levelling dinos for me personally it means that I will not continue to collect XP data. Since the first XP boost when I had to delete all my old data, I collected boss fight XP, hundreds of values for the BFT tourney and over 12k data rows of normal fights. I will certainly not put any effort or energy into doing the same again.</p><p>I took off my boss fight base XP table so noone will get wrong/old data. Also I will discontinue to collect data for gathering grids as MT seems prone to fiddle with the contents and chances there too, lately.</p><p>For me part of the fun of DinoRPG was finding out stuff like the above, but I guess I will continue with just playing the game now.<br>Thanks again to all people who contributed to my projects in one way or the other.</p>

                <p>I guess it's enough time now. Here comes the <strong>Steel Alchemist</strong>. Looking like the combination of a Tower Guard and a Lower Guard he seems actually to be weaker then both. He does not have the elemental protection the Tower Guards have and the only 'bossy' thing about him is his 1000 HP. He is slow and does a normal void attack that hit my level 53 dinos for 1 point of damage. He has no perception and can be poisoned.</p><p>What a whimp!</p>

Additionally buddy skills are valuable, as each hit with the correct element does 29-31 damage (so 40-41 hits are needed to defeat him) no matter how strong or weak a dino/buddy is. I would advise to turn all A skills off (maybe apart from flood), as they might trigger over an assault in the right element.</p><p>XP was 3174 for a group of 3*78 (with int and prof), so 960 Base XP for each dino.</p><p>This boss seems slow and his attack on one of the dinos did 1 point of damage. So far I see no reason not to grind this mission, maybe grouping with lower level dinos pays of too. On the way to renew the mission you can kill dark smogs in the island area.</p>

                <p>Kind of a boss, too: the flying FAT spaghetti monster. It appears during the Hendeson missions together with 2 normal spaghetti monsters. It's twice as big and has 1000 HP instead of 500. Not sure if it does more damage than the normal type of monster, it died too fast. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>
