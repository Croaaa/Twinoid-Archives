But I have had a few napos from wars so that helped.<br><br>Also a yes on this one. Cant get a demon with out it and theres the napo <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br><br>As for the demon I cant say yet but I think it will be worth it.

                <strong>Question 1</strong>: was it worth it doing the kabuki quest?<br><br>Definitely, that quest is probably the best DinoRPG has to offer. Fun story, fun fights, worth doing it, just for that. But the Kabuki is quite cool itself ^^<br><br><strong>Question 2:</strong> was it worth it waiting for, and paying for, the extra kabuki egg(s)? <br><br>I checked only when I had dinos around, but then almost every hour. I haven’t spawned my 2nd and 3rd egg quite yet, but I surly hope that they will be worth it *g*<br><br><strong>Question 3:</strong> was it worth it doing the strange alien quest?<br><br>Well, you can do that quest over a long period of time. So unless you rush this quest, using Irmas, it is worth it. You basically get stuff for free, how can you complain about that?<br><br>Although the new forum is quite dead, and the presentation tab is not that important, but a extra nappo is always good to have.<br><br><strong>Question 4:</strong> was it worth it doing the katacombs?<br><br>Oh the catacombs were a mayor pain. Click, load, click load, click load … gnarf<br><br>Healing was the worst, when you would go all the way back and then inside again. Very bad usability. But again, a nappo is a great reward and the demon scroll gives you an aim to work towards to. <br><br>sooo… worth it but really annoying. I was a bit sad, that there was no real story involved. Some (undead/monster hunter) NPCs and more Scrolls with messages on them, to find would have been nice.<br><br><strong>Question 5:</strong> was it worth it getting a demon dinoz?<br><br>I don’t have one, but… nope ^^<br><br>Considering the price of a demon it is just not worth it. To me this is an achievement when you have finished everything else and there is nothing else left to do. Or if you really want to spend some money :p

                <cite>Question 1: was it worth it doing the kabuki quest?</cite><br>Yes, definitely.  The quest itself is quite fun, not too much hastle and explores different parts of the game and the reward is excellent.  One of the best parts of the game IMO.<br><br><cite>Question 2: was it worth it waiting for, and paying for, the extra kabuki egg(s)?</cite><br>I guess this comes down to how much you want extra Kabukis.  But there are several opportunities in the game to 'grind' at totem island with no real loss, so I would say yes.<br><br><cite>Question 3: was it worth it doing the strange alien quest?</cite><br>Hmm, it's borderline this one.  It's a lot of running around and the pen is pretty pointless.  The napo is good, but of course 1 is useless, so it's only worth anything if you are active in clan wars in a clan that can make T20.<br><br><cite>Question 4: was it worth it doing the katacombs?</cite><br>Haven't done them yet, but it's next on my list and I'm looking forward to it.  Something a bit different at least and the rewards are good.<br><br><cite>Question 4: was it worth it getting a demon dinoz?</cite><br>I think it's difficult to quantify.  As someone previously said, it's something to do when you feel you have done everything else.  An 'endgame' if you will.  It also gives a use to those dinoz you really have nothing better to do with.  For 99% of players though it is probably never worth it.

And I will go later with my fav dinoz to clear all the place and also get the Napoz.<br><br><cite>Question 4: was it worth it getting a demon dinoz?</cite><br>It depends. As my goal is to have fun and interesting time and to try out all the possibilities this game has to offer, than everything new for me will be worth it. Atm I am w8ing for cute and strong Demon Winks to buy.
