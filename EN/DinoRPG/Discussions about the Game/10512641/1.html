                <span class="tid_mod"><cite>From epoq - Thursday 12 January 2012 at 15:30 (Added by 0ver2</cite><br>Clans can face off against each other in the great Manamana wars! Here is how it works, and the rules:<br><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>The king needs Mana , a rare form of energy, in order to bring stability to the dark world, and he is ready and willing to reward the clans that bring him the most mana. This is the resource which is to be collected and protected during the war. However, to increase their stocks of Manamana , clans only have one solution in this scenario: shake the very foundations of their enemies' castles!<br><br>To participate in the war, a clan must build their castle.<br>The registration fee allows you to build the castle and gets you 100 Mana points.<br><br>Do you have your eye on your neighbour's mana stocks? Get your hands on it by going to WAR! By making their castle quake, you generate energy Mana which will become yours if you win the war. The clan who destroys the enemy castle gets to have a quick look around their treasury, and pockets 5% of their Mana stock. The more Manamana a castle contains, the more Mana there is to be earned by attacking it.<br><br><strong>Wars</strong><br><br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> War duration: 40 hours.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Wars can only be declared against clans with the same or less honour than you. (see Honour)<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Wars are two-way events. A clan which is under attack can also attack their assailant's castle.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Do you have allies? Don't hesitate to call on them for help, but be warned, that could cost them valuable honour points, you will most likely need to make it up to them!<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Transferring Dinoz Masters will no longer be permitted during the last 15 days of the War (only participating clans are affected)<br><br>Winning a war means you can keep the Manamana generated by breaking the castle's walls, and whoever delivers the killer blow will earn 5% of the defeated clan's Manamana stocks. There is no limit to the amount of Manamana that can be stored, your castle is big enough for everyone!<br><br>A war is lost if the attacking or defending clan's castle is destroyed. Rebuilding the castle is not automatic! You can leave the castle in that state until you gather your thoughts, or better still, come up with the best possible battle plan!<br><br>Be careful not to leave your castle in ruins for too long, as that will cost you honour points. (see Honour) You can rebuild your castle at any time by paying the rebuilding fees.<br><br>Do you fear the worst? Is this war going badly? It's a shame, but this time it is not possible to give up. So grit your teeth, defend your stronghold and wait for it to pass (or your walls to collapse)!<br><br>Have patience! you will have a short wait of 10 minutes between declaring war and being able to launch your first bloody attack.<br><br>If victory is not claimed by either clan (attacker(s) or defenders) before the war is over, the costs of the war are lost and the Manamana generated will vanish, never to be seen again.<br><br><strong>The Castle</strong><br><br>Unlike Clan Wars, the castle has no spells and no buildings.<br><br>However, there is one solution to regenerate the castle's hit points, repair crew Dinoz!<br><br>Have you got some great little Dinoz, but whose knees tremble at the sight of battle?<br><br>No worries! They can still be of great help to your clan: they can join the castle repair crew. Every Dinoz positioned at the castle will see the "Repair the Castle" option. As soon as they select this action, the dinoz will be attributed 'repair crew' status, and every hour, they will add 1 hit point to the castle. If the castle is destroyed, repair crew dinoz will no longer have this status.<br><br>To ensure that everyone isn't tripping over one another, there can only be 50 repair crew dinoz per castle.<br><br>When you add a dinoz to the repair crew, they will begin a repair task which will last 1 hour. When the hour is over, and the castle is still standing, 1 hit point will be restored and the Dinoz will continue repairing.<br><br>The castle can hold an unlimited number of defenders.<br><br>This time, the war has spread to formerly peaceful lands. Your castle can be build anywhere in the Kingdom of Dinoville, but also to the west of Dinotown: Dinoplaza and the Cinema Paradino.<br><br><strong>Declaring Wars</strong><br><br>In order to be able to declare war:<br><br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> the attacking clan must not have declared more than 3 wars already today.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> the attacking and defending clans must have castles (not ruins).<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> the attacking clan must have sufficient funds to declare war.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> the attacking clan is not currently involved in another war they have declared.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> the defending clan cannot have more points than you. (see below: Honour)<br><br>The cost of declaring war depends on the Manamana stocks in possesion of the attacking clan.<br><br>These fees will be paid using the ingredients in the clan treasury.<br><br><strong>Honour</strong><br><br>getting covered in dust and brick is all well and good, but the King wishes to reward only those who do it with class!<br><br>Each clan begins with 100 honour points and can accumulate up to 200. Every day, at midnight, the King goves 5 honour points to every clan whose castle is still standing. A Clan cannot declare war against a clan which has more honour points than they do. if they wish to attack this clan, they must regain honour points or be patient and wait a few days.<br><br>Actions affected by honour points:<br><br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Declaring war against a clan which is higher ranked than you will earn you honour points! (1 point per 5 places in the ranking, with a maximum of +10 points.)<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> in the same way, declaring war against a clan with a lower raking to you will cause you to lose honour points! (1 point per 5 places in the ranking).<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Declaring war against a clan which is already under attack (helping an allied clan, for example) will cause you to lose honour points. The number of honour points you will lose will depend on the number of attacks currently in progress against the castle.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Declaring war against the same clan several times in one day will cause you to lose a lot of honour points (especially if you won the previous wars).<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Declaring war against a clan you have already faced in the last 4 days will be considered as a grudge held against the opposing clan and will negatively affect your honour point score.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Every day that passes without declaring war will cause you to lose one honour point (cumulative). This also applies if the castle is left in ruins.<br><br><br>Honour point gains/losses will be stated when war is declared but before confirmation.<br><br><strong>Battles</strong><br><br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Battles are "to the death". There is therefore no need for a fight timer.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Survivors will leave the combat with the same number of health points as they had at the start. However, defenders only have one reduced means of recovery (see "Defending").<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Survivors can re-equip with objects before attacking or defending again.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Attcks on a castle itself always cause 10 points of damage when inflicted by a Dinoz and 5 points for clones and reinforcements.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> A 30 second delay is enforced after each attack to allow for injured Dinoz to be removed and healed.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> The attacking group must wait 1 minute before attacking again.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> There will always be a minimum of 3 defenders against any attacking group. (Even one solo attacker will face 3 defenders, and a group of 5 attacking Dinoz will face 5 defenders)<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> The defending group will consist of dinoz selected via the clan page. It will be made up of living Dinoz, in the order specified.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Battles earn for attackers.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Dead dinoz (attackers and defenders) are transported to their clan's castle and are healed to 100% of their . They will be given the status of recovering, which blocks all actions until the end of the current war (whether it is abandoned, won, or lost). If a Dinoz is recovering, they will be given an Irma's Potion disguised as a daily action.<br><br>At the end of a war, any Dinoz which dies in it will be healed to 100% and the recovering status will be removed. Any Dinoz killed while defending will be assigned to defend their castle. Any attacking Dinoz which are killed will be moved to their own castle.<br><br><strong>Defending</strong><br><br>A player can put an unlimited number of Dinoz in defence. However, during an attack, the player can only have 2 of their DInoz in the defending team on any given day.<br><br><br>Defenders have limited recovery potential. Each defender has 8 recovery points. When the defender participates in defending the castle, they will lose a recovery point. To regain this recover point, the defender must not participate in any battles for the following 2 minutes.<br><br>Once a defending dinoz has no more recovery points, they will progressively lose their ability to recover at the end of a battle in the following manner: 100%, 90% etc. etc. right down to 0% if they are on the receiving end of several consecutive attacks! If, between 2 atacks, 10 minutes elapse, the dinoz will recover 10/2 = 5 recovery points.<br><br>In short, as long as the defender isn't attacked almost constantly, they will continue to regain 100% of health lost at the end of the battle. However, if there is a massive invasion, little by little they will lose their ability to heal themselves at the end of the battle.<br><br>There is an obligatory 10 minute wait between removing a Dinoz from the defending team and being able to add it again<br>Enjoy the Mana War!</span><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>oldest post:<cite><br>As most of you you know, the developers have been working on both a new war and COTC system. I hesitated to announce what the next big event would be, as I didn't want to announce something that wouldn't be ready. <br><br>After a meeting with them this morning, they told me that a new type of war is available, and that after a primary test on another server, the war system has once more been upgraded and should result in a really exciting war (rules to follow).<br><br>The help file will also be updated soon to reflect the changes.<br><br><strong>SO...The FIRST MANA WAR will begin on the 14th of December and will last approximately 1 month. </strong><br><br>There will be a Championship of the Clans (hopefully with the new system) around the end of January/ start of February. <br><br>I'm looking forward to seeing if there will be any more breakaway clans / clans downsizing / new alliances in this war which actively encourages clans to fight their equals. Down with bullying smaller clans! This is a war you can all get stuck into!<br><br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_3.gif"><strong>Epoq</strong></cite>

                Call to arms I say. I'm one of those players who support the community and want our voices to be heard when it comes to the game. It seems the promise made by some devs that the community would have a bigger influence on what is happening on this server was lie.<br><br>The majority of players who voted in the survey did NOT want Mana wars, but cash is king and greed is obvious. The system with the Mana wars force clans to spend more gold to keep up with the top or they will fall down the ranks. So players will have to chose if they want to spend more money on the game or tumble down in the clan ranks. The answer to this choice is fairly easy and most players will spend more. MT are not stupid and they know that this will happen and it will result in more profit for them.<br><br>Of course MT are entitled to make money on their game, it is after all a company. But MT should not have surveys or try to convince us that they listen or value the thoughts of the community when they clearly do not.<br><br>I'm tired of being rolled over all the time, there is a limit to how much crap a player and the community can take.

                Well i have to agree bit with zapp, the major part of the comunnity told that they dont want Mana Wars, and now we will have mana wars.<br><br>Even in this thread <a href="http://en.dinorpg.com/forum/thread/174269/" target="_blank">http://en.dinorpg.com/forum/thread/17426 9/</a> we can see people dont want war <strong>YET</strong>, they all want cotc.<br><br>Even more, I dont think the date for the war will be the best one <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"> Because epoq will go on holidays and if the war dont work as it should it we will be on troubles <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"> <br><br> Epoq told on one of the chats that our server was not ready for get mana wars, and now we will get it without any advise or at least a talk with the comunnity about what we all want?<br><br>And for last, The game is having alot of troubles lately and bugs, plus the comunnity is still waiting for the prizes of  the  2nd Film Contest ,Halloween Contest Entries among other things, so i personally think all problems that our server have right now should be solved   <strong>first</strong>, before think on a new War/COTC system for what<strong><u> we are not ready</u></strong> and what <strong><u>we dont want yet</u></strong><br><br>So even if we are required to get the new War and COTC system without matter what all comunnity think, at least we should  wait until next year after epoq and devs are back of his holidays <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"> So if something goes bad on the event he can work with devs and fix it.<br><br>And adding another thing... We had been told we were going to get an advise of<strong> 2 Weeks before the WAR/COTC beging</strong> with all rules and more so we all can be ready for it.<br><br>We will get a new War System with only <strong>1 week in advance</strong>, and even without the rules <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif">. I think it will be really hard for Mid and Small clans to get on this war. Only clan with French formed members will know how the war work. So for me this is really unfair.<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/chart.gif">

                How about we call Fusion war instead, or something else? It's still just war with other rules anyway and mana being as a theme for points and story.

                I think at this point everyone is just anxious for a clan event. Even though I must agree that a new Mana War wasn't what most people wanted, I'd take it over a broken or unfinished COTC any day <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">.

                In the last official Epoq chat, Epoq said something like "probably won't be a mana war as nobody seems to want that". But the survey didn't mention anything about mana wars, and anyhow, I think most people on this server don't even know what a mana war is or how it works (apparently it is different from the war with spells that require mana).<br><br>Now, with all that being said, Epoq said this would be a different/upgraded version of the mysterious mana war, so for people who already know about it, maybe we can wait and see what the new version looks like before complaining.<br><br>We <strong>were</strong> promised 2 weeks. It is always nice to have some advanced warning so clans can get organized. Which is also why it would be nice to have the rules ASAP.<br><br>Also, when the rules are posted, can we please get ALL the rules posted (I'm only mentioning this because it has not been the case in the past). Also, there will undoubtedly be lots of questions, hopefully Epoq will check in the forum to answer as many as possible where the rules will be unclear. As previously suggested a chat once the rules are posted might also be helpful. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                I would love to see a well designed new event. So I am glad this will happen. However, as we know from the experience everything new comes with some bugs and other stuff that is left out or not entirely understandable. So everyone start working on your complaints already <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"> as the Bible say's "let he who is without sin, cast the first stone".

                I think we're ready for an event, it has been awhile... A new type of event sounds fantastic, I just hope they really listened and adjusted things that the French disliked.<br><br>I think we all  can for the most part agree that:<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/arrow.gif">We want rules and descriptions so we know what the event is and how it works, allowing us to make strategies. If we are uncertain about things, we want to have time to get these things clarified by our admin. <br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/arrow.gif">We want no bugs (obviously). In the inevitable event that there are bugs, we want the developers to not say "wait until next time" but fix them in a smart way without an unreasonable wait. <br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/arrow.gif">We want everything translated. Often, when something new is brought to our server, big parts of it are left in French. Even more frequently, bringing something new over from the French server leaves us all with French for things that were translated prior... a perfect example being "level" on the account page has reverted to French.<br><br>These few simple things will make the community more excited for the event and less likely to assume this will be another rushed cluster____ for money.

                A cotc would have been more entertaining. Well well, mana war is better than normal war at least.<br><br>Imo the clan score should not only be the amount of mana in your clan's storage at the end, but also a part of the mana you had at every day.<br>Example:<br>@ the first day you have 100 mana. At the end of the day 10% of your days mana will be stored at an "untouchable" mana score pool (your clan's mana will stay at 100, but you will get 10 manascore points for that day). At the next day you have 150 mana and 15 get added to the score. At the end of the war your total score would be (current mana)+(mana score points). <br>Result: encourages every clan to gain as much mana as he can throughout the whole war -&gt; more action.<br>Now if chaining isn't possible either, passive play won't be promoted anymore in the mana war and the fun can begin imo.

                Bring this war on, just hope to see a new and improved awesome CotC afterward.  I love the new content and everything I think is improving nicely on the server and it is as active as I can ever remember right now. Think everyone is just so disappointed because it has been so long since we had CotC as long as some fun is to be had in the war I say there is no harm done playing it first.<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                <strong>Epoq - Monday 12 December 2011 at 15:29</strong><br><em>Hey everyone, I know you're all keen to get a look at the new rules for the impending war...<br><br>I'm just waiting for the devs to send the final official version across (and for this we shall need a crossbow, an hourglass, three goats, one of us must learn to play the trumpet, whilst another one goes like this...) then I'll get it posted here asap.<br><br>Thanks for your patience...<br>Epoq</em><br><br>We are all still waiting for the final official version of the rules. It has now passed 23 hours and 30 min since your post. Either the so called "final version" was not that final or perhaps its only one poor person working on this "final" version.<br><br>This is certainly not how things should be. But the sad thing is that I doubt much will change since the DinoRpG community dont seem to care. In the previous posts it has been like 6+ people who has been irritated, annoyed or upset about MT and their constant behavior towards the community. The rest of the people seem to be happy and are putting up post like;<br>"<em>YES, we want to fight now. We dont care about the rules. We only want to have fun</em>" <br><br>How can it be fun not to know how and what to expect from the new Mana war? <br>Lets say that you enter the war and seconds later all your dinoz are dead and cant fight for the remaining time of the war due to that you did not know the rules. Would those people still say things like "<em>Well, I had fun while it lasted</em>" <br><br>Clan wars and COTC are a lot about strategy and planing. Kinda like any war or group event. If you lack planning and intel things will usually not go well.<br><br>Just my thought!

                <cite>Clan wars and COTC are a lot about strategy and planing. Kinda like any war or group event. If you lack planning and intel things will usually not go well.</cite><br>I agree that it is very tough to plan and get organised when we do not know what we are planning for.<br><br>imo, when creating anything new it usually is better to spend the time to get it right rather than rush to have 'something'.<br><br>And while you can never please everyone, right now there is a lot we do not know - here are just a few:<br>1. Is there a registration process?  Can only registered clans participate?<br>2. Is there a fee to enter?<br>3. When does it start? (there are 24 hours in Dec 14th <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif">)<br>4. Can players join a clan once the war is in progress?<br>5. Are there restrictions on who / how many clans we can attack?

                So it doesn´t affect you! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/chart.gif"><br>But there might be others that wanted to participate in the war from the beginning! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/dontcare.gif"> It´s not about "hey I´m not affected in a negative way, so who cares!" it´s about evening it out! THe war got announced and there should be a compensation which fits the situation. If we just get like aticket again, all of us, that´s not appropriate compensation in my eyes, because it´s for everybody, not just the people affected negatively by the delay and that wouldn´t be compensation then!

There has been a lot of talk over supposed changes in other servers over here and people whom do not play at those servers are bound to reach some sort of conclusion, no matter how misinformed. If you are more in touch with the issue you should probably inform us about it instead of questioning a perfectly valid concern.

                @ Pilaf, i'm talking about the "complete" rebalancing<br>including the initiative balancing that is still on test on french dome/dojo<br>there was something like 3-4 different seting trying to avoid initiative skil chain (detonate, flood, vine, flood, detonate oops sorry you're dead without mooving)<br>but none was really succesfull (they try to lower thoses initiative skills without making them too weak)<br><br>and yes mial it's a REbalancing<br>as, at start, the game was close to balanced, but double and spheres skills make it unbalanced, so it need to be balanced again -&gt; rebalancing <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/idea.gif"> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br><br>even re-re-re-balancing as there where some other try to balance a few things (some monsters, scales, other monsters... but maybe it was before the english server <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/question.gif"> )

                this really is starting to be annoying... i am patient, and usually think zap overreacts(well, with his vocabulary atleast <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif">), but come on... first, war is announced at a totally unreasonable time considering it's a new format and the admin will be on vacation... then we can't get any notice, whatsoever for 2 weeks(was it more? probably?) and it ends with a quick announcement just so we keep up with the other servers... i'm sorry but that's forcing things, becouse the others servers were getting some info atleast a few days ago... personally, a week difference doesn't really matter to me, but rules, rules, rules... come on... for once give us some rules in advance...<br><br>the logic of going to the other server for info is failed logic, we are a sepparate community, and until that changes(if it ever does) we are entitled to get our own info ON TIME... <br><br>usually, whenever i'm whining it's directed at MT, becouse usually it's their fault not epoq's(well, it's their fault this time as well), but this time, imo, epoq holds a bit more responsibility. he isn't entitled to tell us he goes on vacation. when, where, and for how long, but a short msg in the news, "war will be postponed for atleast 2,3 weeks, save your money, prepare your dinoz, blablablabla..." would've been enough for me to not complain at all, and probably for most of the community...

                It is not nice that after a half month shifting  of the war we don't have rule s still. I mean for some clans that want to get some fun without using a big amount of money it is important to know the rules in order to adjust the strategy especial if it is a brand new system that wasn't tested at this server yet. So please post the rules asap.

                Clans can face off against each other in the great Manamana wars! Here is how it works, and the rules:<br><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>The king needs Mana , a rare form of energy, in order to bring stability to the dark world, and he is ready and willing to reward the clans that bring him the most mana. This is the resource which is to be collected and protected during the war. However, to increase their stocks of Manamana , clans only have one solution in this scenario: shake the very foundations of their enemies' castles!<br><br>To participate in the war, a clan must build their castle.<br>The registration fee allows you to build the castle and gets you 100 Mana points.<br><br>Do you have your eye on your neighbour's mana stocks? Get your hands on it by going to WAR! By making their castle quake, you generate energy Mana which will become yours if you win the war. The clan who destroys the enemy castle gets to have a quick look around their treasury, and pockets 5% of their Mana stock. The more Manamana a castle contains, the more Mana there is to be earned by attacking it.<br><br><strong>Wars</strong><br><br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> War duration: 40 hours.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Wars can only be declared against clans with the same or less honour than you. (see Honour)<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Wars are two-way events. A clan which is under attack can also attack their assailant's castle.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Do you have allies? Don't hesitate to call on them for help, but be warned, that could cost them valuable honour points, you will most likely need to make it up to them!<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Transferring Dinoz Masters will no longer be permitted during the last 15 days of the War (only participating clans are affected)<br><br>Winning a war means you can keep the Manamana generated by breaking the castle's walls, and whoever delivers the killer blow will earn 5% of the defeated clan's Manamana stocks. There is no limit to the amount of Manamana that can be stored, your castle is big enough for everyone!<br><br>A war is lost if the attacking or defending clan's castle is destroyed. Rebuilding the castle is not automatic! You can leave the castle in that state until you gather your thoughts, or better still, come up with the best possible battle plan!<br><br>Be careful not to leave your castle in ruins for too long, as that will cost you honour points. (see Honour) You can rebuild your castle at any time by paying the rebuilding fees.<br><br>Do you fear the worst? Is this war going badly? It's a shame, but this time it is not possible to give up. So grit your teeth, defend your stronghold and wait for it to pass (or your walls to collapse)!<br><br>Have patience! you will have a short wait of 10 minutes between declaring war and being able to launch your first bloody attack.<br><br>If victory is not claimed by either clan (attacker(s) or defenders) before the war is over, the costs of the war are lost and the Manamana generated will vanish, never to be seen again.<br><br><strong>The Castle</strong><br><br>Unlike Clan Wars, the castle has no spells and no buildings.<br><br>However, there is one solution to regenerate the castle's hit points, repair crew Dinoz!<br><br>Have you got some great little Dinoz, but whose knees tremble at the sight of battle?<br><br>No worries! They can still be of great help to your clan: they can join the castle repair crew. Every Dinoz positioned at the castle will see the "Repair the Castle" option. As soon as they select this action, the dinoz will be attributed 'repair crew' status, and every hour, they will add 1 hit point to the castle. If the castle is destroyed, repair crew dinoz will no longer have this status.<br><br>To ensure that everyone isn't tripping over one another, there can only be 50 repair crew dinoz per castle.<br><br>When you add a dinoz to the repair crew, they will begin a repair task which will last 1 hour. When the hour is over, and the castle is still standing, 1 hit point will be restored and the Dinoz will continue repairing.<br><br>The castle can hold an unlimited number of defenders.<br><br>This time, the war has spread to formerly peaceful lands. Your castle can be build anywhere in the Kingdom of Dinoville, but also to the west of Dinotown: Dinoplaza and the Cinema Paradino.<br><br><strong>Declaring Wars</strong><br><br>In order to be able to declare war:<br><br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> the attacking clan must not have declared more than 3 wars already today.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> the attacking and defending clans must have castles (not ruins).<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> the attacking clan must have sufficient funds to declare war.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> the attacking clan is not currently involved in another war they have declared.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> the defending clan cannot have more points than you. (see below: Honour)<br><br>The cost of declaring war depends on the Manamana stocks in possesion of the attacking clan.<br><br>These fees will be paid using the ingredients in the clan treasury.<br><br><strong>Honour</strong><br><br>getting covered in dust and brick is all well and good, but the King wishes to reward only those who do it with class!<br><br>Each clan begins with 100 honour points and can accumulate up to 200. Every day, at midnight, the King goves 5 honour points to every clan whose castle is still standing. A Clan cannot declare war against a clan which has more honour points than they do. if they wish to attack this clan, they must regain honour points or be patient and wait a few days.<br><br>Actions affected by honour points:<br><br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Declaring war against a clan which is higher ranked than you will earn you honour points! (1 point per 5 places in the ranking, with a maximum of +10 points.)<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> in the same way, declaring war against a clan with a lower raking to you will cause you to lose honour points! (1 point per 5 places in the ranking).<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Declaring war against a clan which is already under attack (helping an allied clan, for example) will cause you to lose honour points. The number of honour points you will lose will depend on the number of attacks currently in progress against the castle.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Declaring war against the same clan several times in one day will cause you to lose a lot of honour points (especially if you won the previous wars).<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Declaring war against a clan you have already faced in the last 4 days will be considered as a grudge held against the opposing clan and will negatively affect your honour point score.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Every day that passes without declaring war will cause you to lose one honour point (cumulative). This also applies if the castle is left in ruins.<br><br><br>Honour point gains/losses will be stated when war is declared but before confirmation.<br><br><strong>Battles</strong><br><br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Battles are "to the death". There is therefore no need for a fight timer.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Survivors will leave the combat with the same number of health points as they had at the start. However, defenders only have one reduced means of recovery (see "Defending").<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Survivors can re-equip with objects before attacking or defending again.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Attcks on a castle itself always cause 10 points of damage when inflicted by a Dinoz and 5 points for clones and reinforcements.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> A 30 second delay is enforced after each attack to allow for injured Dinoz to be removed and healed.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> The attacking group must wait 1 minute before attacking again.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> There will always be a minimum of 3 defenders against any attacking group. (Even one solo attacker will face 3 defenders, and a group of 5 attacking Dinoz will face 5 defenders)<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> The defending group will consist of dinoz selected via the clan page. It will be made up of living Dinoz, in the order specified.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Battles earn for attackers.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> Dead dinoz (attackers and defenders) are transported to their clan's castle and are healed to 100% of their . They will be given the status of recovering, which blocks all actions until the end of the current war (whether it is abandoned, won, or lost). If a Dinoz is recovering, they will be given an Irma's Potion disguised as a daily action.<br><br>At the end of a war, any Dinoz which dies in it will be healed to 100% and the recovering status will be removed. Any Dinoz killed while defending will be assigned to defend their castle. Any attacking Dinoz which are killed will be moved to their own castle.<br><br><strong>Defending</strong><br><br>A player can put an unlimited number of Dinoz in defence. However, during an attack, the player can only have 2 of their DInoz in the defending team on any given day.<br><br><br>Defenders have limited recovery potential. Each defender has 8 recovery points. When the defender participates in defending the castle, they will lose a recovery point. To regain this recover point, the defender must not participate in any battles for the following 2 minutes.<br><br>Once a defending dinoz has no more recovery points, they will progressively lose their ability to recover at the end of a battle in the following manner: 100%, 90% etc. etc. right down to 0% if they are on the receiving end of several consecutive attacks! If, between 2 atacks, 10 minutes elapse, the dinoz will recover 10/2 = 5 recovery points.<br><br>In short, as long as the defender isn't attacked almost constantly, they will continue to regain 100% of health lost at the end of the battle. However, if there is a massive invasion, little by little they will lose their ability to heal themselves at the end of the battle.<br><br>There is an obligatory 10 minute wait between removing a Dinoz from the defending team and being able to add it again<br>Enjoy the Mana War!

                The most honorable clan (not the first ranked) can't be attacked by anyone. But that's no problem in itself. If that clan attacks anyone, the defender can fight back without losing honor obviously. Besides: The clan can only attack other clans higher in ranking (and probably won't win many of those battles) or it loses honor again.

                I very much like the idea behind the honour system, but the way i read this one means that it's much easier to lose honour than it is to gain it. As a matter of fact, the only way to gain honour is by attacking a higher ranked clan (if i understood correctly from Epoq's post). But what if all those higher ranked clans have more honour than you? Then you will lose honour, no matter what you do. And if you end up with 0 honour, there's no one left to attack accept for other clans with 0 honour, which everyone will probably end up at. Or can you gain honour by defeating the clan that attacks you? That would solve a lot of issues, although it would still put the strongest clans at a serious disadvantage since no one would be stupid enough to attack them.<br><br>Apart from this little issue i really like these new rules. Well done ^_^

                <cite>so if a clan is attacked by 2 other clans, is each attacking clan considered a separate attack for who can defend (so defending player can have 2 dinoz * 2 enemy clans for 4 defending dinoz total from that player for that day) ?<br><br>Or is it 2 per day regardless?</cite> As fights are separated by 30s magic fog, there's no possibility of having two fights of two clans at a same time. And if you read the honour system, the second clan will lose honour for attacking an already attacked clan.<br><br><cite>Clan A attacks clan B.<br>Later clan C join in and attack clan B too.<br>If a dinoz of clan B dies during an assault launced by somebody from clan A, when will be that dinoz available again?</cite> For clan A, B and C Dinoz will be available when clan B castle is destroyed, thus finishing the war instantly, or when war duration for those clan is finished.<br> In case of several clans, I suppose if Clan A get its caslte destroyed, Clan A dinoz get revived, but as Clan C war continues, Clan B and C dinoz didn't get revived until war end.

                True, that way they´ll probably manage to take down clan B´s castle, but it´ll give both clans honor penalties.<br>Plus the dinoz involved will be revived to full health after the war is over, so once clan B rebuilt it´s castle it can immediately launch a counter attack on the two clans if their honor dropped by enough.

                @ Loxagon: true, i missed that one. But still i wonder if that's going to be enough. It does balance the scales a bit since stronger clans have less trouble keeping their castles up, but we'll see how it'll work out.<br><br>The choice of when to join the war has become a lot more interesting though. It's no longer just a matter of how much ingredients are available.

                I have a big doubt. Is there a differentiation between the attacking clan and the defending clan?  Since they can attack each other and war ends on one of the castles falls?<br><br>Because let's say clan A attacks clan B. My clan, if it attacks clan A, we are attacking a clan already at war, right? We have to be the ones to take down the castle to get the 5% mana, and we will have a honor penalization. Do you think this is how it will work?

                Hugo:<br><br>My impression from reading the rules leads me to think that both clans become "locked-in" and cannot follow a chain like you are talking about. Clan A can only declare on Clan B if Clan B is not fighting anyone else. Once they start the fight, it is to the death (or time runs out). That kind of thing, I think.

B can still launch wars without dinoz alive and winning either.<br><br>Clan A ranked 100th, honour 150, mana 200.<br>Clan B ranked 50th, honour 120, mana 300.<br>Clan C ranked 75th, honour 140, mana 250.<br><br>1st stage:<br>Clan A attacks clan B on Day 0 at 00:01, A being 100th, it will gain +10 honour.<br>Day 1:<br>Clan A ranked 100th, honour 165, mana 200.<br>Clan B ranked 56th, honour 125, mana 300.<br>Clan C ranked 69th, honour 145, mana 260.<br>Day 1 at 15:01, Clan C attacks Clan B, Clan C lose, let say 3 honour points for attacking an already attacked clan. But being 13 ranks from B, C will gain 2 honour points. Total: -1 honour.<br>At 16:01 Clan A will do its 3 daily wars.<br>Day 2 at 00:01:<br>Clan A ranked 72nd, honour 170, mana 232.<br>Clan B ranked 62nd, honour 130, mana 300.<br>Clan C ranked 70th, honour 144, mana 260.<br><br>2nd stage:<br>Day 3 at 00:01:<br>Clan C couldn't attack on Day 2, it gets -1 honour. Clan A launch only one war.<br>Clan A ranked 71st, honour 175, mana 254.<br>Clan B ranked 65th, honour 135, mana 300.<br>Clan C ranked 70th, honour 143, mana 260.<br>Day 3 at 06:01, clan A attacks clan B, clan A loses 3 honour points, being 6 ranks away from B it gains 1, but having re-attacked within the 4 following days it loses another 3 points. Total: -5 honour points.<br>At 07:01, clan C do its 3 daily wars.<br>Day 4 at 00:01<br>Clan A ranked 72nd, honour 175, mana 254.<br>Clan B ranked 67th, honour 140, mana 300.<br>Clan C ranked 58th, honour 148, mana 372.<br><br>3rd stage:<br>Day 4 at 21:01, clan C attacks clan B, C loses 3 honour points, being 9 ranks above B, it loses 1 honour point, but having re-declared the 4 following days it loses 3 honour points. Total: -7 honour points.<br>Day 4 at 22:01, clan A do its 3 daily wars.<br>Day 5 at 00:01<br>Clan A ranked 63nd, honour 181, mana 354.<br>Clan B ranked 68th, honour 145, mana 300.<br>Clan C ranked 59th, honour 146, mana 372.<br>Day 6 at 00:01, clan C couldn't attack, -1 honour points. Clan A launched one war.<br>Clan A ranked 58th, honour 186, mana 380.<br>Clan B ranked 70th, honour 150, mana 300.<br>Clan C ranked 61st, honour 145, mana 372.<br>Day 7 at 00:01, clan C couldn't attack either, -2 honour. A launched its war.<br>Clan A ranked 56th, honour 191, mana 401.<br>Clan B ranked 72nd, honour 155, mana 300.<br>Clan C ranked 64th, honour 144, mana 372.<br><br>At this point Clan C cannot attack clan B. In practical case, clan B can ask clan D to finish him or crush clan A or C to deliver him. As ganking would be obvious tactics, clan A and C will be probably trashtalk and ganked by the whole server.

                2. I believe wins don't really matter to the points here as in previous wars, the points you get are for attacking (every attack gives mana, unless you don't finish the war) and you get 5% of the clan's mana supply if you destroy their castle (so if another clan makes the last hit instead of you you only get the mana for attacking, not the 5%)

                It would make sense if Black Hole did the same thing it has always done: it removes one dinoz from battle, but without killing it. So long as there is no announcement that says otherwise i assume the rules surrounding skills are the same as with the previous war(s).

                Another question today... I'll have more soon, but today my doubts are:<br><br>-Let's suppose 3 clans with distinct power: A&gt;B&gt;C.<br>B attacks C: C is weaker and is not even going to attempt to retaliate. Now A attacks B, and we have the same situation, B won't even try to attack back. B's castle is destroyed before C's castle. Does C take the win over B? Even if C made no attacks on B? Or if it did, is there a minimum for it to win the generated mana?<br><br>-The honour will serve only to make this war work, or will it also matter for the ranking as a multiplier, like reputation used to be? Will we have an incentive to have a high honour, or have an incentive to have honour just higher enough than the clans we want to attack?

                Thank you, Kayin. So a clan that declares a war is safe from attacks while the war lasts, that's correct? <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                After talking to Kayin in the chat, the citation is apparently a mistranslation/mistake - you can't attack a clan that's declared war on someone else (to prevent chains).  What it currently says (a clan can't declare 2 wars at the same time) is also true (as it has been in the past), but I don't see that stated anywhere else in the rules.

                I also think so, what I said makes more sense and I understand the same from spanish help page.<br><br>I think there will be a penalty on attacking a clan that is at war, regardless of who declared. Or nor, we'll see. I also think the situation I described is possible, C defeating B because of A. What I'm hoping for is that the generated mana from clan C is so low that the win doesn't really matter. I think the more attacks, the more mana is generated. At least I hope it's that way.

                Ok after re-reading.<br>Every clan can attack any clan, with these limitations:<br>- Haven't done its 3 wars (attackers only),<br>- Haven't a declared war (attackers only),<br>- Have the castle built (attackers and defenders),<br>- Have more honour or equal to defenders,<br>- And have enough in treasury (attackers only).<br>Sorry for the confusion.

                prolly damage to castle walls...<br><br>on a sidenote: how come <a href="http://en.dinorpg.com/clan/860" target="_blank">The New League</a> have 0 rep/honour?

                sorry for this chat-like discussion, I'll try to get a little more detailed...<br><br>of course they should have more than 100 honour, but IF they started with 100 mana, they can't have had a ranking difference big enough to get them this amout of honour points, can they? (1 honour per 5 places)<br><br>The same thing seems to apply to other clans as well... MK for example gained 10 honour by attacking a clan that is only 7 ranks above them.<br><br>I might be wrong here, but I either expect there to be an error in the initial Mana distribution when a clan builds its castle or in the "honour per ranks above" ratio.

This also applies if the castle is left in ruins.</cite><br>There's 14 clans who built their castle. So it doesn't explain how LOoT get 115 points in honour. Or else, the ranking is based on the initial clan creation. An older clan will gain easily reputation, huh?

                @Wobby:<br><br>Yes, this system is utter shit. Because you can't declare wars, you will start to lose honor daily with increments, leaving you stunned even more. I think this needs to be fixed.<br>Clans not starting at the first day will have very big problems on the german server because it is so tiny. <br><br>The only thing this system leads to is 1 fight per day to keep honor high and you are out when you lose some honor and can't come back from it.

                2 questions:<br>- The rules say we have to declare at least one war every day to not lose honour points. We've won one war today which was not declared by us, but was a defensive war... does that mean we will still lose 1 honour point at the end of the day if we don't declare a war ourself or does this one count as well?<br>- You will lose 1 honour point for declaring a war on a clan every 5 ranks lower than you... does that mean we can attack clans that are less than 5 ranks from us without penalty?

                <cite>Following unexpected events in the great Mana War, we have made a minor adjustment to the configuration. From now on, counter-attacks will generate less mana than a normal attack. That is to say that you will earn more mana by adopting an offensive strategy than by simply relying on counter-attacking your enemies.</cite><br><br>Well with that fixed I guess war can carry on as planned.

                If you add repairers to your castle after it is down, it will get rebuilt by them starting at 1hp and going at the usual repair rates.  This was a bit confusing at first as it's not clearly stated in the war rules.  If you don't want to do this "free" method, you should always use the 10k treasury to rebuild it with 400hp.  This is why they eject the repairers when the castle goes down, so as not to automatically rebuild the wall.

                Forgive me Martock but this IS stated in the rules, or more precisely the opposite is posted:<br><cite>A war is lost if the attacking or defending clan's castle is destroyed. <strong>Rebuilding the castle is not automatic!</strong> You can leave the castle in that state until you gather your thoughts, or better still, come up with the best possible battle plan!<br><br>Be careful not to leave your castle in ruins for too long, as that will cost you honour points. (see Honour) <strong>You can rebuild your castle at any time by paying the rebuilding fees.</strong></cite><br>To me, "not automatic" means that getting the castle back up is independent of the Repair Crew. As well paying the rebuilding fees seems to indicate the same.

                Sorry, but you've completely lost me.  Getting a castle back up CAN be independent of the repair crew, or COMPLETELY dependent on them.  Your choice.  Either way, as I said, it's not clear the effect of adding repair people when a castle is down.  This is why I think some have complained about castle automatically rebuilding because there's also no control to remove a repair person that a clanmate added other than contacting them and getting them to remove it.

                @Violator - we would have rather had the fair fight. We moved several dinoz to fight you guys and were disappointed that you were a second castle with only 1hp - Not your fault. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"> But taking the points from us isn't a solution either since we spent irma / ingredients / one of our declarations. <br><br>@Epoq The rebuilding needs to be fixed. Clan leaders have the option to choose who can rebuild the castle. The builder system is ruining this.

                Apologies Martok. Let me try again.<br><br>First, my 2 citations were from page 12 of this thread (the Epoq announcement of how the war was to proceed.) From that we can glean that<br><strong>The castle can be destroyed.<br>The castle can be rebuilt.<br>The castle will not be automatically rebuilt.<br>The Clan can leave the castle destroyed, and will have to pay to have it rebuilt.</strong><br><br>From further down Epoq's post we get this message about the Repair Crew:<br><cite>As soon as they select this action, the dinoz will be attributed 'repair crew' status, and every hour, they will add 1 hit point to the castle. If the castle is destroyed, repair crew dinoz will no longer have this status.</cite><br>From this we get:<br><strong>* Dinos are assigned to the Repair Crew.<br>* If the castle is damaged they can shore it up at +1 hit point per hour per dino.<br>* There can be 50 Repair Crew dinos (so up to +50 hit points per hour<br>* If the castle is DESTROYED, any dino with Repair Crew status will lose this status.</strong><br>From this last point it is understood that the castle at zero hit points (destroyed) can ONLY be fixed by someone in the clan with the authority. Whether the castle is repaired to full 400 hit points or 1 hit point is unclear.<br><br>This is what I believe the rules state. Also, this is not what is happening in practice. If i have this wrong please correct me.

                Okay, I have a problem! It's been about... I dunno 20th time we've build our castle, and we always keep looking for Clans to attack, but there is none! ALWAYS!!!<br><br>We've only managed to declare war 3 times, in the 1st and in the 2nd day of the Mana War! After that, once castle has been repaired, we searched for a Clan to attack, but nothing there! One minute later, we were attacked!<br><br>This happens ALL THE TIMES! How come we can't NEVER attack a clan, but EVERYBODY else seems to be able to attack us?<br><br>We declared 3 wars in these 4 days, and we received about 10 times as many wars!<br><br>This Mana War is e-Xtremely imbalanced!

                Daniel, all I can say is try to hang on, be patient, try to win your 5 honour per day. For that, you have to have castle (not sure if at midnight or any part of the day is enough), and declare a war per day. If you don't declare a war you only win 4, next day 3, and so on. So be patient and try to hang on, maybe your honour can go back up and you start finding some more targets whose honour falls. Falling in the rankings like Veren said can be a good idea to find new clans to attack. And absolutely look at your honour cost for attacking a clan, don't let yourself lose more honour. Good luck <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif">

The rules claim:<br><em>Declaring war against a clan you have already faced in the last 4 days will be considered as a grudge held against the opposing clan and will negatively affect your honour point score.</em><br><br>So does this mean full days, as in you have to wait until 5th day at 0:01 am. Or is it 96 hours. Like it works now, it is 96 hours, and then it would better be worded like that.

                There has been more misinformation (which I think has given with the best intentions! but still semi-correct or even wrong) on this war than any game i've ever played. And i'm an old guy. Played a lot of games <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>A lot has to do with the "rules" being simply wrong. Other with bugs. Really at this point the "why" it is wrong is sorta moot.<br><br><cite>Hell no. 1 honor values more then 1000 mana, if the lack of that 1 mana will keep you out of the war for 2-3 weeks.</cite> I found this interesting. It is really two points. I agree that <strong>right now</strong> 1 Honor is more important than 1 Mana, but this axiom is incomplete!!! It is situational. On the last day of the war is 1 Honor more valuable than 1 Mana? No. The last day of the war Mana is everything, not even 1000 Honor would = 1 Mana. What about the 2nd last day? The 3rd?<br><br>As for the other argument made in the citation, I think we will all agree that any move that keeps you out of the war (i.e., an offensive war) for 2-3 weeks is bad. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>But where the Honor thing will get <strong>really</strong> interesting is when a bunch of clans are all up around 200. For any solid mid-sized clan (situation #2) you WON'T want Honor, at least not 200 Honor. Maybe 185, just enuf to poison the taste of your clan to say the top 5 who want to poach your Mana.<br><br>No, at some point the middle clans are going to want to shed off their Honor like clothes at a nudist convention. And who cares if the castle is down? you'll just lose more Honor, not be able to be attacked, and hopefully still retain enuf Rank (Mana) to get good prizes.

                Jakey, I think you've misunderstood. In your second scenario, where the midsize clan wants to dump honor... If there are lots of clans (presumably stronger clans) with 200 honor, no amount of honor will save you. At that point the amount of honor you have has no bearing on whether a mid size clan will be a tasty target, only how far below the other clans they are in the standing. If a clan is at about rank 25 the top clan might only lose 5-6 honor by attacking you. That is determined by your mana ranking, and not all by the amount of honor you have.

                And also a Rank 1 Clan can attack down to Rank 30 at 200 Honor, since they get +5 at midnight.  While it's better to do -0-3 wars, it's possible for them to do so, so not even low Mana can protect you once clans reach 200.<br><br>This is an interesting aspect of Mana War. Two phases... The "SAVE ALL THE HONOR" phase, and the "SPEND ALL 5 HONOR (or less) BEFORE 00:00" phase.

                How is a holiday going to affect whether or not clans reach 200 Honor? <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/lol.gif"><br><br>What am I assuming again?  I think I was assuming that 200 was the magic Honor number, correct me if if I'm wrong though.  And yeah, it was an estimate, might be more like 1-3 Days.  Or am I not allowed to make educated guesses/estimtates either?

                OK, I have to say, that it was on de.server. Maybe its different there.<br><br>And maybe could a GC-Member join the discussion because it was them who killed us and lost 3 honour points. And I think we were not that far away from each other in ranking, but I cant remember the correct positions.<br><br>I thought they lost the 3 honour points against us because of the counters of clan B.<br><br>Maybe GC can confirm that their honour loss came from somewhere else.

                Imo: with lower clan numbers they would need to start the honor closer to max honor. I am pretty sure that we will see 2-3 wars by each (trying) clan each day once they have reached the 200 honor to not waste the +5 each day. Imo then we will have enough action. So if all were able to reach this state faster it would mean we'd see more wars faster.<br>Imo the strategic behind this is not bad - to have two phases: one where you have to be very picky at chosing your opponents to maximize your honor and then the other phase where you try to make the most out of your daily honor income. It is just that the first phase drags on for too long, it would be better to shortcut it, mby even decrease the war duration to 4 weaks and adjust the values so that we will see about 1,5 weaks the honor buildup phase and 2,5 weaks the all out phase.<br>Well just my thoughts on this...

                Just want to agree that the update about saying you must have a castle up at 0:00 server time makes the game worse. I know it changes the mechanics to fit the rules, but the rules make it difficult for clans with large populations in Asia, the Americas, and Europeans with early jobs/classes. Plus it would have been alot easier just to rewrite the rules to fit the mechanics. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/chart.gif"><br><br>Also, I want to know, what does the following really mean? It's kind of ambiguous when we think about repairers... <br><cite>Castles will, from now on, be rebuilt with full HP.</cite><br><br>Does it mean that if there are repairers, the castle won't be built until the ingredient cost is paid or the castle reaches 400 health?

                <cite>Thanks Epoq!<br>But you still haven't addressed the two most important glitches, the first one I'm sure you know about, The Cookies losing 31 Honor and some other clans gaining 30 Honor, and I've sent you a PM about the other one.<br><br>Those two should be top priority fixes right now! </cite><br>Wobby:<br>As I was very surprised that we gained 30 honor on the first day I've read the War rules, which says every 5 difference in ranking gives the clan +1 Honour. At that time MK was 1040th on the ranking by age and the clans we attacked were above us with 60-80 ranks or more. So the honour gained was because of this. Are we sure this was a bug? If not, only one bug remains, your clan's (if the clan you attacked was not below you by 50 or something in that ranking).<br><br>If this is not a bug than MT should learn how to communicate the proper starting conditions for the events because this could be just the begining.<br><br>If not the intended ranking was used than this is a bug indeed and the whole above post is in vain. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                <cite>Also what screws these small clans is having their castles built in dinoplaza when many of their dinoz are too young to get there or are not old enough to handle the giant smashrooms. </cite><br>I don't think I've ever lost more than 10 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_life_en.gif"> from Giant Smashrooms, even with a level 10 solo dinoz.  It sucks more that Cinema Paradino is so isolated that you have to spend up to 12k just to get to enemy's castle for just a group of 3 (Cinema to Marketplace)... Phills is also terrible.  MT didn't think things through when they kept random castle location spawning along with dead attackers spawning at castle.

                So I explain to you what happened last wednesday, because I was who pushed the declare war button.<br><br>I was sitting at the front of the computer and waited to get somebody at least 5 spots over us.<br>That time LOoT already had 110 honour, so<br>I tought it is just written wrong in the rules and we got +10 for attacking 5 spots higher.<br>When I saw that the clan on the first position has a castle(we were on the 6-7th position) I pushed the declare war button. We did 2 more attacks right after the first, so that way we had 130 mana at the first evening.<br>Later on I came to the forums and read it here that something wrong with the ranking.<br>MT fixed that on the second day.<br><br>I wrote a letter to Epoq, to keep a maintenance and correct all the honours manualy, because that time less then 30 clans has entered the war.<br>Looks like this is more complex than I tought <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br><br>What I don't understand, how did a few clans lost that many honour?<br>The person who pushed the declare war button didn't saw that big number with a minus in front of it?

                Wobby:<br>The game watched an initial ranking where all clans count (not just the ones who built their castles), that ranking was based on the age of the clan, the older a clan the higher ranking it had. MK is a relatively old clan so it was the 1004th (sorry previously I wrote 1040th) we attacked the 923th, the 600 something and the 578th clan.<br><br>Now this could still be a bug because we have a ranking based on clan treasure which would be better for initial ranking because it shows a correlation with power.<br><br>But the main problem is MT didn't tell us what will decide the initial ranking (an initial ranking was necessary because of the Honor system and the equal amount of mana each clan had at the beginning, as the amount of mana decides the rank now and the rank decides if an attack cause the clan to gain or lose honor).

The Cookies attacked a clan which was displayed higher in the chart<br>3. It was the first attack of the first mana war. Nobody knew that -31 was gonna affect our honour like that, especially when you put it together with the above 2 points.<br><br>Impossible to change it now? Seems quite easy to me. Log in to the database. Add 31 to honour. Save changes. Done.<br>If the initial ranking was based on the age of clans and not random, then based on the war history it is totally possible to find out where to add and where to remove honour points!

                Wobby,<br>As I wrote two times already the game viewed an initial ranking <strong>which had nothing to do with the number of clans who joined the war</strong>, just the age of the clan. As the ranking updates only at midnight our ranking was not changed after the first attack.<br><br>The question is: What was MT's plan with the initial ranking (which was needed because the Honor system depended from the ranks)? We still don't know if it was a bug that they used the one based on age or they wanted to use another but they failed.

This was stated very clearly in the rules. However we went DOWN in honour. Now there are 2 possible bugs:<br>- either the rules were wrong and one should go down in honour when attacking a higher ranked clan, so 'the big number with a minus in front of it' is correct.<br>- or 'the big number with a minus in front of it' was bugged, and the rules were correct.<br><br>How the hell is anyone supposed to know which of the two was a bug????<br><br>In hindsight, the second possibility was not the case, while the first possibility is what happened. Our honour decreased according to the big negative number... <strong>while it was stated very clearly in the rules we should have gone UP!!</strong><br>This bug was only the case for the first day, but a -31 honour drop (and I'm sure you can't disagree with this) affects every day from the war, from the first to the last.<br><br>So I'll sum it up again: we LOST honour while we should have GAINED honour, which means this bug (so motion twin's coding, so motion twin itself) screwed us from day 1, and is still screwing us by not fixing our honour.

                Ramza,<br>1.) As I said I think MT failed to communicate this because an initial ranking was <strong>needed</strong> because every clan who built castle had the same amount of Mana and Honor and you can't make ranking between equals. <br><br>2.) I'm not saying anything about the problem with Cookies. That was a bug I'm sure (nothing can explain a 31 point of Honor loss, not even the above initial ranking theory, because you can lose only 10 Honor) but I'm not sure if the rapid Honor gain of some clans was also a bug.

                BLAAT: in your perspective: your action would caused two different thing based on the two opposite information (rule wording vs. displayed number in brackets)<br><br>1. total disaster (if you thought that the big negative number in the bracket is correct), - (and if you understand how the honor system works)<br><br>2. almost nothing (if the one positioned about a few places higher (+1 honor).  (again, if you understand how the honor system works)<br><br>3. and you would have the option to do nothing, until this is cleared out - on the forum, for example (as it had been) - this is the best option if you dont understand how the honor system works<br><br>1 out of 3 options you had chosen far the worst. AND (almost) all of the other clans had the seam opinions. - and as I read the forum, only 2 clans made this error.<br><br>so, it is ok, that you got in a situation that was not in the intention of MT's rules, and you dont like it, and this can be a bug, but man, based on LOGIC and UNDERSTANDING you could avoid the situation (you have just explained that you had the options to choose from). <br><br>and yep, you are right, the best one would have been a complete reset asap, (in the first hour of the war). and it is strange, that when MT developers programs code like this, they didnt think it over? the starting situation IS crucial! they simply forgot that? and what about testing?? I would fire a programmer for less..<br><br>-d2k-

                what you say has nothing to do with the point d2k.<br>granted, there is indeed always the option of doing nothing... but it is also stated in the rules you need to do one war a day if you don't want to lose honour <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"> + maybe only 2 clans were affected because the others then could see what could happen. It is very easy to say what we should have done. We at cookies now know, with the benefit of hindsight, what we should have done... but at the time we did not have the benefit of hindsight <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br><br>but... AGAIN (!)... the point is (and FFS, why do I have to repeat it over and over again): we should have gained honour but we lost a shitload and now the only fair thing to do is to give what we lost due to a bug back.

                Re: small clans<br>Perhaps they are not expected to do well against larger established clans with current numbers and levels, but maybe they should at least be able to have fun with clans their own size. If they can't build they can't war. No war = less fun = why keep playing the game = no new players = slow death for DinoRPG. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/chart.gif">

                @TSEETAH<br>It's seems that after last change you cannot repair from ruins. You have to spend 10k each time. That's why I said small clans are kicked out.

                I must say that 10k is a ridiculous amount of ingredients. It used to be point dependent if my memories serve me correctly. And even then 10k would have been a pretty high price, even for the bigger clans.

                i guess its their fixes.<br>By not forcing people to war each day, they allow clans that are stuck with low honor and no target to gain honor and get out of their situation.

                What was wrong on the first day: <strong><u>after you built your castle the rank wasn't update so the system would count the rank difference based on creation dates</u></strong>.<br><br>This is not how it was supposed to work. If we declared a war on the 1st clan at the time the honor said: 106 (-107). That made the rule very clear... not. Everyone who declared wars had to make his own guess on how it would work.<br><br>As you have noticed, honor is almost the most important thing in this war so far... and yet they haven't fixed the glitch that made a difference of 60 honor points between 2 equally honorable clans...<br><br>The worst part is, they ignore us and if/when they change something it's something that could wait until next war.<br><br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twinlove.gif">

                lol, and what about if you are attacked by two clans, who has their castle at the same location? <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"> will there be two counterattack button? and yep, you have to guess whom it is? <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br><br><strong>Cookies</strong>: <br>1. you made a wrong 'guess'. accept it. you should not guess if you risk that much (it seems that you do understand the meaning of honor)<br><br>2. stop saying that you are out of this war. this war lasts 90 days. about at the half of the game you will have 200 honor, so you can attack anybody. the mana collected that far will be nothing compared to the stealing of 5% from the top 3-15 that you will do 3 times, each day for the rest of the war. think over the system again, please. <u>you will be positioned top 3-6 this war too - regardless of the error you suffered at the start</u>.<br>(ok, I see the current situation is boring for you, but trust me: it is boring for us either.. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>3. yes, MT does not care about your posts. please stop flooding Epoq - it does not lead to anywhere. I personally a little bit surprised, because I hadnt saw Cookies posting this many posts/mails during the cotc2, where 2 or 3 clans (yep, MK is one of them) were excluded from taking ANY price (well, we had the option to face LOOT, C&amp;D and BBC for sure, no matter what we do) - and this was because of the pairing system (well, without offense I think that system ,where the clan like Empty (sorry to blame you guys, no problem with you) can have first prize (7 victories) and MK, a sturdy top10 clan can have nothing, whatever they do is 'a bit' worst, than the current situation, where NOTHING IS LOST FOR YOU!<br>so, if your feeling about righteousness is so high, then I dont understand your cotc2 reaction. if not, then what is your problem now? <br><br>you will be back to business in no time, stealing sugar, flour and honey from everybody.. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"> just be patient..<br><br>-d2k-

                In my opinion, the rule that the castle should standing at midnight is weird. It's better select another time, say 16:00 when almost all time zones are in active state (why to force people to play at deep-deep night?), but even better to let clan to choose when it wants to build a castle during the day like it was.<br><br>For the small clans I also vote that they should be able to build castles at low cost.<br><br>For the honor I believe there should be some plus when you attacked by high ranking clan. May be you should gain 1/3 of the difference in case of win or attacking clan should lose honor like if defending clan declared war to attacking (if it should negatively affect such declaration). And even more, the honor must be positively affected only in case of win, while negatively in either case.

                A common clan can expect to get destroyed every day. If now repairing is only available by paying the ingredient costs it will lead to clans needing to spend about 420k worth just for repairing their castle. Imo that is too much, especially for small or medium clans. It could easily be in the range of the declaration costs and many wouldn't complain. Or enable repairers to repair the castle but "activate" it only after 400 HP have been repaired.

                ... or activate it right after getting 1HP. It's up to clan members should they spend 10k and have full HP or use free repair and have vulnerable castle which can fall after one attack. Previous system was the best but activation after repairing 400HP would be still decent.

                What make them more creative in last week, day by day? I want to taste it too <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"> <br>But how does this affect the fact that in a week the first 30 clans get to 200 Honor? And then everyone will be able to attack anyone. And will always win the big clan. Small clans haven't in this war no one chance. We are looking on rankings, rules, other clans and thinking: why do we continue to play in this Great Mana War?  <br>All war is reduced to the fact that higher in the rankings will be the clan, who has more high level dino with full complect of spheres. Tactics? Strategy? Nonsense. Just 5-dinoz team 50 lvl with spheres.

                wow, this throws the Honor out the Window.<br><br>Now, it becomes a regular bash for anyone.<br><br>Basically, Honor prevented strong clan to attack everything and everyone.  It was a restriction.   Don't attack the same clan too often, don't attack lower clans, etc...<br><br>But with 10 honor at reset?   It means, in 4 days, when most top 5 clans will be at 200 honor, they can, daily, kill 10 low clans for fun and still stay at top honor!<br><br>Honor protected mid-clans.  Now, there is no real honor since it's given easily and hard to lose, some clans are gona get pummeled.

                I.<br>About the 5k castle building rule which right knocks small clans out for the war.<br>Why not introduce a score limit, so small clans which are lower than 5.000 score points (as in tamer ranking score points) altogether are excepted of this rule.<br><br>From a certain score on the players should have some gatherers and collectors and should be able to contribute to the clan treasury.<br><br>For sure this rule might not be the smartest solution, but this way the small clans can rebuild when they want. Since 10k coins makes no difference for bigger medium and high end clans at all, the same nuisance should be granted to the small clans before they are fully fledged and working.<br><br>II.<br>Why has the rebuilding castle rule disabled anyway? If people did rebuild unintentionally, they should have learned their error after a while. Since you are very vulerable to enemy attacks the first hours. If this is the problem, it is overprotecting behaviour by MT and counters the intended effect by shutting the small clans out.

                This recent update has just turned the mana war into a free-for-all (big clans) hunting season. Any lower clan is fair game now. <em>"Why should we care it costs 3 honor to attack that lower clan? We'll have 10 more after midnight"</em><br><br>Naturally middle level clans will turtle back to protect what mana they achieved so far. So from now on the only castles we'll see standing are top 10 or 15 clans. It's their <strong>private</strong> event now, and any middle clan doesn't stand a chance of reaching top 20. Strategy or member participation doesn't matter anymore. Rebuild and you'll get a war declared within 30 seconds and be killed 10 minutes later.<br><br>Thanks for nothing, MT. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/chart.gif"><br><br>But hey, at least the Cookies* will be sent back to their rightful position. And all you had to do was turn a cool but buggy event into a boring <em><strong>and </strong></em>buggy event. <br><br>*(Not complaining against the Cookies. I believe they deserve a better position than what they were heading to because of a bug.)

                Oh well, i take that everything as a promising start into a new era of warfare. The bugs suck big time, but if it werent for them, the mana war would be awesome. Please stick to it, sort out the bugs, and make some minor tweaks ( defender healing )<br><br>What i dont like, is that the rules got changed without a warning, meaning you might miss out on VERY important informations, just because you dont reread the manawars thread in that certain situation it might have come in handy lol<br><br>whats funny, is the fact that actually people now argue that bubble is worthless because of the non-existing battle timer <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"> Well, it shows that ini-nerf and bubble nerf should have been made together .

                I can confirm that.<br><br>This happens almost only, when you are under attack, and/or some rearranging the Deff.<br><br><br><br>I just wanted to know, what people think about the change for repairs crews.<br><br>With the update, I get the feeling the they are pretty useless, unless a you can defend the attack, and the attacker had a "lucky punch".<br><br>I see that it is to dangerous to allow one unattanded dino in the repair crew having build up the castle with 1 <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_life_en.gif">, so an update was needed.<br><br>But I believe it would be more fun, to have the repair crew have some successful moments.<br><br>So here my suggestion:<br>If a castle is down, you can assign dinoz to the repair crew.

Communication between the administrators and the players is of utmost importance for a happy server, and it's one of the largest problems with this war right now.

                <cite>Abusing means, when you find something which doesn't work as the rules says and you using it</cite>I would like to think that we don't need to have our lawyers present when discussing this issue on the matter of terminology interpretations. You know where I stand, we know where you stand. THE ONLY one who can make this clear is someone from administration. So I guess we will have to wait on Epoq to clarify. <br><br>This is called a WAR for a reason. But I see it more as a competitive sport. I wonder if F1 (or any other competitive sport) has similar problems when a <u>competing</u> team is helping another team (their supposed enemies) to score more points.<br><br>So let's be completely honest. If you think that what you are doing is considered a fair play, then I wonder who are you trying to deceive - us or yourself.

                I was waiting for this subject to explode for some time now <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/keepcool.gif">.<br>Is not MK fault, but again MT (wishing to improve chooses the wrong feature)....created the useless <strong>repair crew</strong>. By adding this feature gave this opportunity of producing "friendly" mana. <br>I think <strong>repair crew</strong> is a useless feature, because: <br>- for top 25 clans, if you enemy break your +40 dinoz defense, all is gone....within minutes. Strange thing is that you can produce even "hate" mana (same thing like friendly one, but with a enemy), because if your enemy has "repair crew" it will take few hours, even a day, to remove them .....<em>only the player who added them can remove them</em> (so if they are from different time zone it will last until they will see the message to remove them)...they will just sit quiet and wait for you to finish taking mana;<br>- for clans below 25 it might change a bit the outcome...since a war can last more than a day....not sure they can post if due to repair crew they came back and won a fight <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/eek.gif">.<br>Guess the repair crew is good only for small clans with less than 20 members fighting each other <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink2.gif">.<br><br>But again, you should not complain about MK trying to exceed their status, because is normal to wish a higher position in final ranking...the problem is the useless feature ...<strong>repair crew</strong>. <br><br>MT?

                Please accept that <strong>this war is</strong> not about who beat Rakshasa/LOoT/Void Allieance/BBC/etc, and how many times. It is <strong>about collecting mana</strong> - <strong>as the rules says</strong>. The last war systems used the previous things to determine rank - we had different strategy (yes , this is the word that means that we think, use wits, instead of strength, because we have to compensate it: there are many stronger clan out there than MK)<br><br>we have the brain to put 3-4 things together and the outcome will be better than if we would play "push the button to destroy the weaker clans". this is called strategy. using timing, organizing things, working with allies, etc. I know its strange, but quite a few times it worth to think. this is the difference between the dojo and the war. In the dojo, you use strength and tactics. In the war, mostly strategy, diplomacy, and only then strength and tactics.<br><br>But it seems that you guys are always offended if we (MK) have better position than <u>you think we deserve</u>. isnt that strange?<br><br>what I call '<strong>abuse</strong>' is the position of a <strong>moderator</strong>, who is a member of a competitive team <strong>posting </strong>into a closed forum a <strong>rule-interpretation from his clan's point of view</strong>. That looks like "official thing", but the moderator is responsible for the forum rules only. So trying to show something that is not your favor (or havent got into your mind) as a thing against the rules is what bothers me more.<br><br>And when you say "<strong>unsportsmanlike war</strong>", then I suggest you to <strong>read Sun-tzu</strong><br><br>anyway, <strong>we have asked Epoq too</strong>: <u>let him decide</u> if what we do is against the rules, or not, is this 'unsportsmanlike'  - or not, and shall we have to fight in the war like attaching at that time and that opponent and with those dinoz with a given method what the "wise council" (a collection of our opponents in the competition) decides we have to.<br><br>-d2k-

Is there a solution?<br>I'm not sure.<br>One thing is clear: aside from Honor, nothing stops an unhappy clan to attack the "friendly castle" and stopping the mana farm.<br><br>Maybe a solution could be to lower the honor penalty of the second attacker by 1 honor per hour.<br><br>So: if you join a war already started 6h ago, you only lose 4 honor...

                Could we maybe just once not get personal? Every one complains about lack of players, but if I were to join this game right now, one look at the forum would convince me to spend my time elsewhere. And that is no ones fault but our own, the players (I include myself in that).<br><br>@Topic<br>See it as you will, it will always depend on your position. Some things of a clever strategy that others didn't think of or can't use themselves and ofc the will get angry. Was the same for me often enough in this game.<br><br>Most of us should stop trying to appear high and mighty when so many of the older players in the bigger clans did things that were against the rules or could be considered abuse, and there is a lot of that, that isn't even publicly known...<br><br>Discussing problems is alright, but we won't get anywhere if we employ the good guys and the bad guys sides in those arguments.

Because it is easy <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif">, and not against the rule, a good and practical leader will use it. Why should not? Because our enemies has moral or ethical problem about it? <br>This possibility was find out, all clan could use it. Everybody knows this war is a test war. <br><br>So MT please fix it or leave it. We will find another way to prove we are the best   <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/cool.gif"><br><br>It is quite useless to talk about is it fair or not, well-use or abuse.

                Who is right and who is wrong? Exploit? Bug? Flaw?<br><br>I can agree on that the system is flawed with the bouncing off walls attack strategy. But there is nothing in the rules about not being able to attack allies, wings or friendlies or use diplomacy to gain a advantage over other clans. This has been used for years and is not a violation of the rules.<br><br>The main question is how will MT address this if they thinks its a exploit? Right now if your in the honour range you can attack the same clan over and over every third day or so. So what is going to prevent clans from attacking their allies, wings and friendlies back and forth every third day to get more mana? MT cant issue a rule or cap that prevents clans from attacking each other at all. Then there would be no wars to fight <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/chart.gif">

                This is very easy to stop, if you don't want to be farmed don't use repairers. You also can declare a war and be countered to try lower your farmer honour...<br>Using this tips the clans trying to farm other clans will have it more difficult and risky.

                druid2k, Epoq already received a lot of mails about this.

It is a sweet addition for all comunity but players are abusing it. It costs items to the defense for some free <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_life_en.gif">. Not really fair for the defender. I have already talked to Epoq about this anoying issue.<br>I am asking all the clan leaders, to stop there members to do it and why not creating a 'war chart'?

                Whatever way it is put, the use of these "glitches" is not "honourable" imho, but it is up to each clan to decide to take advantage of it or not. And so is to be the best with or without honourable behaviour.<br><br>I, for one, am against it, but it is just an opinion like any other.

                You guys are looking at it the wrong way.<br>Btw, what i'll say here is a personal opinion.<br><br>This is a War, and a War is a show of strenght, strategy, and domination.   Stronger clans will finish over weaker clans, etc etc...<br><br>When 2 clans decide to use an alliance to make Mana, like Magyar are doing, you can stop it.    If you don't like it, just put an end to it.  How?  Attack them and break their castle.<br><br>"But we are not strong enough!  We can handle their defense!  They will counter-attack and kill us!  <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/nooo.gif">"<br><br>Well, if that is the case... it means that they are stronger then you, will rightfully end up higher in rank then you, and, well, err... shut up.<br><br>The clans that are affected by this are clans that are actually in the fight over ranks with Magyar, and thus strong enough to break them.   <br><br>And yes, we are back to War: a show of strenght.   Magyar are using their strenght to farm mana.  You are either strong enough to stop it, or not.   If you are not, it does not really concern you, as they will finish higher in rank anyways.   If you are strong enough to fight them, well, put your foot down and do it.<br><br>Once again, i am only speaking for myself.

                Magyar's "strength" is their Honor (I'm sure they are very formidable without it, but that's beside the point.)  The only reason other clans don't kill MK is because of Honor.  The Honor comes from a glitch.  So err...<br><br>Anyway, I found that you CANNOT declare a war on a clan that has declared war on you when you both have the same amount of Honor points.<br>Pity, means you get less Mana for the counter attack.

                So, it was a nice "mini dojo" before our walls. Lvl 50 dinoz vs lvl 50 dinoz. Fair "head or tail" game. Always win the side who cast the first flood+vines+liquid/detonate. Nice job Dino rpg testers. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/chart.gif"> Next time I just throw up a cent and play with myself.

                IMHO this event was not even close to be prepared from far starting... it would be better not to give players option to use glitches, b'cos im not even sure that i wouldnt use it too... <br><br>To Adm. Next time just think about game mechanics and so on before making event that ruins all the teamplay ingame, because as i can see doing nothing (like leading clans) is better than sitting 24h/7 and fighting in a real war... but, hey, its only my opinion...

                Wobby, no. We would wait until we get to 200 honor, and would blast them, if they are weaker then us. If they are stronger, then it doesn't matter anyhow if they are 2000 or 2000000 mana before us.<br>It isn't only about the mana farming though. If you read through this thread, you will find complaints about everything from sending scouting dinoz to attacking higher ranked clans for honor. <br>In the previous war, I was in an other clan, which was top10-20. Guess what? People complained that we rebuild our castles too seldom, so they can not take revenge attacks against us. That was also an abuse.<br>Basically nothing should be allowed according to some people, except maybe attacking the weaker enemies over and over with level 50 dinoz. And if I take into consideration complaints from previous wars, that shouldn't be allowed either, according to some.

                @RatKillah  actually reset at 16:00 would suck.  It would require all american waking up early instead of you europeans staying up to an hour most people stay up to anyways.

                That issue would be solved easily if the rule would be:<br>- rebuild you castle that day (meaning the actual rebuild action, not an already standing castle) or don't lose your already existing castle at daychange through the whole day<br><br>Or add a rule:<br>- you castle must be up x minutes during the day or be destroyed at least y times<br><br>There are a lot of better solutions. Making one minute during the day important is the best way to kill off all players who usually sleep through that minute.

                I think the rule where you lose honor for not attacking a clan should be in play for clans over 100 honour. The problem with this rule was the loop hole that clans with the lowest honour would get into, but if the rule doesn't apply when the clan drops below 100, then we also have the advantage of this rule, which is to force top clans to keep participating in the war. And avoids strategies like Hun Horda's.<br><br>I also think 5 honor a day was enough. Now clans at 200 can spend their daily honor in attacking the same clan every 2 days, or 2 clans attack the same clan if one is willing to spend the 10 honor. Honor penalties become relatively cheaper.<br><br>I also think despite it being a bug, repairers' construction of the castle should be a real alternative for a clan, with the difference that it only comes up when you want with the hp you already got so far with the repairers. It'a a trade-off: you either pay 5k/10k in ingredients to get a full castle fast, or you are patient and use your dino's actions to get the castle up. Would be good for lower clans.<br><br>But this are details, mana wars overall gives way more fun than a normal war <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

You have to figure out better ways to go trough that clans. Lower ranked members have to figure out other ways to help, or wait till they are better. If they want to participate so badly, there are two choices: spend some honour and attacks a lower ranked clan for more members to participate, or those members have to look for a new clan.

                Except it's easy to abuse the counter-attacks.  Just get ghost clans and/or allies to attack you (especially if you have low honour) and you can counter them without any real threat to your castle.  That supposedly happened on the ES server, which lead to the reduced mana for counters.

                The air element has been nerfed to much already:<br>- poisonite injection made a 3rd(Toxic Cloud) and two 4th(Life Breath and Fetid Breath) level skill almost useless<br>- bubble got nerfed, which is good, but not the way they did(it should be fix %, either 50 or 66)<br><br>So only one skill remained why we still see some air dinoz in wars and this is blackhole.

                From the other hand the <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_2.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_4.gif">-dependence does make it a more Kabuki-exclusive skill (on kabuki's it's the strongest, almost as strong as before the nerf) and so it makes Kabuki's stronger in comparison with f.i. bubble winkses than before, which should kinda be right as Kabuki's are exclusive dino's... I think that might be the reason the gamedesigners chose for this solution <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/rolleyes.gif"><br><br>Still sucks for the people that invested time and money on special builds though...

                I think it'd be a good idea to keep 3 vs 3, but fix the Mana formula and reward more Mana to 5 vs 5 attacks. That way players with no good leader dinoz won't struggle, and players with leaders will actually be encouraged to use them. Right now 1 vs 0 or 1 vs 1 generates the most Mana.

                Another suggestion... Don't make Mana gains grow exponentially as the war goes on.  Starting wars early will earn you more points, but if you start much later, you might be able to win 3/4 of the Mana in a couple days compared another clan has gotten from doing wars everyday because the Mana earns (not the steals) are based on the Mana stock of the opposing clan.<br>It'd obviously be a bad idea to make all clans earn you the same amount of Mana, but the Honor system could be tweaked to work more like Reputation.  There might be better solutions, but I'm too lazy to think of anything right now.

                Wobby: I agree, but finding a balance needs a lot of thought and consideration. <br><br>Adding to that, I think that changing the "grudge" rules would be nice. <br>Without asking to bring reputation back, I'm saying it'd be a good idea to bring back the limit for the number of times a clan can be attacked by another clan (in future wars). <br><br>In the past, people have said that a month is plenty enough time for a war. I think even shorter... It starts to feel super mechanical.

                <cite>What's the DinoRPG community think about a clan staying on an attack loop to hide another clan under -10 honour? Unfair, isn't it? </cite>It is a loophole in the rules that MT should close by making it "mana prohibitive", like -500 Mana or something like that. But really, why rebuild at all?<br><br>The same loophole is true for members switching clans to help their buddies, wing clan, etc. There should be a moratorium on clans accepting new members for the ENTIRE event, not just the last 15 days. Clearly MT saw this as an issue (hence the band-aid rule of the last 15 days), but we all know there is no penalty for having the walls down, so any clan that has borrowed players can keep their walls down after the players leave on Feb 14 and hope their mana store is good enough to get them a prize.

                Timeshielding will become more and more common, since the increase of the daily rep gain to 10 has led to an neverending loop of topclans crushing whomever they like, so to just talk about the numbers: I dont see a difference between declaring MK with -10, or declaring 3 top 20 clans with 3*-3 (or whatever you like to ). Like anskar said: The problem will come along with 2 or more timeshielding clans.

It was ALWAYS like this: allies give points, advantage or other ways to help each other.. Like bringing allies to an opponent, and then breaking their walls. Every time, in every war so far!!<br>When a clan (f.e.) makes non-attacking-agreements then that clan is manipulating the results. Of course!<br><br>Wake up, please!! <strong>This is WAR!</strong> (not SPARTA! <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">) It is about having allies, opportunities, laying down, forging pacts,even backstabbing each other!! <br><br>The rules are the same for everybody. But the opportunities, clever ideas, faithful members, activities, allies are not present for everybody. Some of them needs thinking, some of them diplomacy, same of them just luck.. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"> <br><br>-d2k-

                Well, I think a lot of the problem is that MK has used multiaccount ghost clans in past wars so people see Hun Horda the same way.<br><br>Either way, Epoq doesn't care (or he would have spoken up by now? prove me wrong!) - so it doesn't matter whether it is cheating or tactics.

                Now, this is funny that everybody said pro and contra arguments about HH's (un)fair playing style.<br><br>Funny, cuz nobody asked HH, why do we do this.<br><br>I tell you some reason about HH's attacks:<br><br><cite>Dead dinoz (attackers and defenders) are transported to their clan's castle and are healed to 100% of their . They will be given the status of recovering, which blocks all actions until the end of the current war (whether it is abandoned, won, or lost). If a Dinoz is recovering, they will be given an Irma's Potion disguised as a daily action.</cite><br><br>This rules said to me, that my clan members' little dinoz could heal with a suicide attack. So I dont see problem, if i attack a bigger clan. This rule is very good for our small playas, who hasnt RL money for buy healing. I thought this isnt unfair step from us. <br><br><cite>Do you have allies? Don't hesitate to call on them for help...</cite><br><br>This rules said to me, that every clan could make an alliance to help each other. I dont see the problem, why wont ask help from another clan, if that is free. <br><br>I never heard before that any guild keep the rules that would be unfair.<br><br>But... hmmm... ok, then I wait every offer to my clan about manawar-cooperation. (Maybe this was my mistake that I didnt public my thinking about mana-wars, and I didnt cross-check all guild in this server.<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif">)<br><br>So finally every clan-member has free to give an offer to my clan.<br>I wait answers about this questions in offers:<br>- What position can you garantee to my clan?<br>- How many treasury would you pay into my clan?<br>- Why would I choose your clan for cooperation?<br><br>fyi: There are lot of mercenary-clan in other online-games. In this game HH could give -10 honour penalty to your attackers, but what would you pay to HH for penalty?

                We had 35 offensive wars, won them all. We had 2 defensive wars against the number 1 clan (by far), lost once and got a draw once (which to my knowledge nobody else managed to do).<br>Yep, i am sure that -10 honor is stopping everybody from attacking.<br><br>There are a lot of clans with 200 honor around right now, an attack for them at the moment is free, as they would get back all honor at midnight. Same goes for quite some days now. Why are you not attacking at this moment?

                Since MK is -10, it means that if we were to declare war on MK, we have to forfeit all other wars for the day except for neutral.  So either we have to wait for HUN's 40 hours to be up and declare right when it ends, or we have to declare on MK as 3rd war of the day and the previous ones have to be neutral.<br><br>I am not saying MK is top 3 because of use of HUN Horda and Mana farming, all I'm saying is that MK's tactics are unhonorable and making the war less fun for everyone else.  MK has the power to possibly place top 3 without ghost clans or Mana farming. I would respect you guys more for placing top 10 and no farming or ghosts than placing #1 with them.

                Ok, let's take a simple example: while we were fighting Rākshasa, when most of their top attacking dinoz were dead, PL attacked them.<br>Rākshasa won the counter like going through butter in a few minutes, even though most of their hard hitter were dead.<br><br>So there are 2 explanations:<br>1) PL took a stupid decision, they have gone after an alliance they know they can not beat =&gt; in this case they indirectly helped Rākshasa, by giving them free many<br>2) this was a try to get Rākshasa's dead dinoz revived by ending a war; of course it did not work, but it was worth a try<br><br>So anyhow you take it, PL willingly or unwillingly influenced the end result of this war.<br>Where are the 3 pages of complaints about this?<br><br>(no offense of course to any of the 2 alliances, whatever happened is according the rules and a thus valid tactic)

                Let's be honest here, MK, GC and HH have done nothing wrong at all.  This is war, and as the saying goes, ALL is fair in love and war <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"><br><br>It might not be in the full spirit of what was intended, but all 3 clans are fighting fairly within the rules of the war.  If you want to blame somebody for this then blame MT!  It is there poorly thought out rules (yet again...) that have allowed for this situation to happen.<br><br>Where loopholes exist but are not illegal people will use them, and this is true of everything in life.<br><br>As was said earlier I don't think the whole community are against MK on this, just the only people who will post often on the subject will obviously be the ones who have a problem with it.

                So let's make this clear: if one clan asked 10 other clans (with real players of course) to attack it each day, and it will attack back and win every war, then it is totally ok?<br>If the rules allowed it, and there would be a way to revive your dead dinoz all the time, that would be totally ok?

                <cite>I am not saying MK is top 3 because of use of HUN Horda and Mana farming, all I'm saying is that MK's tactics are unhonorable and making the war less fun for everyone else.

I would respect you guys more for placing top 10 and no farming or ghosts than placing #1 with them.</cite><br><br>Mana farming? LOL. Is there MK win against HH? No, so there wasnt mana farming.

                I did get a mail in the mean time that LooT took down PL back then, so the discussion is theoretical only. Even though the attack from PL did happen, and if LooT did not intervine, one of the 2 points would have happened.

                Let's calm down a bit, would you? There's no real point about discussing about Hun Horda covering for MK, GC and others, nor about MK farming on GC, while being unreachable for a while, where still in middle of the war.<br><br>On a side note, PL didn't change anything by attacking Rakshasa, and PL mana <em>supply</em> wouldn't have changed anything if we didn't have taken it.<br><br>No need for anger, nor for brainless speaking either. I understand some people might not love the way these clans do their war business, but better remind you about this:<br><cite><u>Epoq said</u>:<br>If a player is found to be exploiting a bug, whether to gain extra turns/objects/money this is considered cheating and will result in the immediate closure of their account.</cite><br>Loopholes are illegal, no matter what people say... if legal, it wouldn't be called a loophole. Let's MT sort out what is considered cheating or not.<br>In the worst case, clans could be disbanded... but if nothing happens, you only dried your throats for nothing.

                <cite>Loopholes are illegal, no matter what people say... if legal, it wouldn't be called a loophole.</cite><br>The thing is it is hard to say what is a loop hole and what not.<br><br>One theoretical example:<br>Clan A attacks clan B, but can not go through the defences. Neither can clan B on the counter. Clan C attacks clan A, but clan C is a weak clan who had no business being there. Clan A has neither the resources, nor the will to take down clan C, but will wait out the end of the war with clan A, and will take down clan C then. All this time, clan D, ally of clan B, wants to attack clan A, but can not do it without significant honor lost.<br>Now who is abusing? Clan A, because they don't take down clan C right away? <br>Clan C, because they did an attack without hope. Maybe even willingly to block out clan D? By the way, good luck proving something like this.<br><br>Another one:<br>Clan A know clan B will attack it during the day. So it lets it's ally, clan C, take his wall down to 10HP, so it will fall down giving clan C minimal mana. Clan C will wake up with a nasty surprise and a wasted attack. Is clan A abusing with this, is clan B abusing with this?<br><br>Yet another one:<br>Clan A is a very stong clan and attack Clan B. Clan B askes clan A to wait until they take down the wall of clan C, and promises to remove all defense in exchange.<br>So clan B gets some extra mana, which is unfair to his direct competitors, both clans spare some items and clan C gets destroyed in an attack that should not have happened, or even worse, which they would have indirectly won and received a little many from clan B.<br>Who is abusing?<br><br><br>The solution is actually simple, and here I agree with you: let the admins decide. From my point of view everything is fair until said otherwise (except real bugs of course, like mana appearing in your account while you do nothing, or your defence being invincible to do a bug), or nothing except everybody attacking everybody, putting in 100% effort every time is allowed.

Some other clans seemed to think there was a pact among some of the top clans, and I promise you, there is no such pact.</cite>Because of course Wobby is privy to every conversation that happens between every single top clan. No need to reply, I with draw my comment.<br><br>In the [OFFICIAL] Bug Exploitation topic there are 2 posts by Epoq:<br><cite>If a player is found to be exploiting a bug, whether to gain extra turns/objects/money this is considered cheating and will result in the immediate closure of their account.</cite><br><cite>As the rule goes, if something is too good to be true, it usually is. If you find a way to acquire a mountain of gold coins quickly by forcing something to happen that wouldn't naturally, then there's a good chance you're not supposed to be doing it.</cite>I guess it is up to someone else to determine whether these "buddy-wars" fall into Bug Exploitation or not, but consider this: replace 'extra turns/objects/money' with 'mana'.

                There is not enough casttle for attack nowdays. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"><br>Because most of the clan fear to rebuilt their casttle. This situation is not fun for the top clan either. <br>Would you think if we increase the honor penalty attacking lower ranked clan could help a bit?<br>f. e. honor penalty could so high, that f. e. my clan could attack once every week a same clans between top 10-20. <br>but then I would give a (mana or honor) penalty a clan who do not rebuilt their castle every 24 hrs (but I do not force to rebuilt at midnight).<br>The cost of rebuilt should follow the clans' mana point, of course. If you have few mana, you should pay less. Or if you rebuilt your casttle within 24hrs, it could be free of charge...<br>The problem now is the same like in the last clan war: is it esier for us to hunt down smaller clan than fight clans with our lvl. Because it esier we do it, but i don't like it.

                The honour penalty for not attacking after a day shouldn't have been removed. To avoid the downwards loop for clans with the least honour (not being able to attack and being punished by it further increasing their inability to attack), could be fixed by simply having this rule in play only for clans with over 100, for example. Can be another number too, like 130 or 150.

                Jakey, I left CB early to escape your profanity and extreme insults towards me.  Seems pretty pointless when you continue it in the forums.  I have not blocked you like you have done to me, so if you ever have anything to say to me, do it by PM.<br><br>Thanks for the reply Epoq.  So in this case, a clan could make multiple ghost clans and get declarations to -30 and this still wouldn't be any infringement of the sort?  Awesome. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif">

                +1 more suggestion because stronger clan could not find castle easily, they attack every single clan what they find, immediately. So maybe the smaller clan could not attack anybody, because their castle crash down too early. <br>So I would recommend to introduce a time shield: <strong>If a clan rebuilt their castle, nobody could attack it for 60 minutes.</strong> This give enough time for all clan to do at least one attack. <br>Uff<br>sorry for <em>off topic post</em> <br>now you could continue your pholisophic argue about argument.

                I was thinking about another solution for the problem of Clans not rebuilding their castle, which woul also somehow fit into the setting of this war.<br><br>An intact castle could be neccesary to tame the immense forces created by this aggregation of more than 5000 Mana at a single place.<br><br>Therefore, every 24 hours the castle is not being rebuilt, the clan will lose 1% of his mana cumulatively (2% next day, 3% the day after, and so on)<br><br>But alas the war is getting into it's final stages, I doubt there will be a lot of changes anyway.<br><br>Yay, Beta-Testers. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"><br>Perhaps next time the Mana-War will be more thoroughly thought through.

                <cite>Thanks for the reply Epoq. So in this case, a clan could make multiple ghost clans and get declarations to -30 and this still wouldn't be any infringement of the sort? Awesome.</cite><br>Making ghost clans is illegal.<br><br>However, of course you could use this tactic with your real, allied clans.<br>A clever opponent in this case would ask his own smaller allies to take down your allies.<br>A little less clever opponent would attack the your allies on his own, then he would attack you.<br>People who have no other tactical ideas then "look, me have stong lev50 dino, me crush castle" would sit around and complain.

                I think a better rule than honor penalty is to just make clans unattackable by number of days for every difference in position.  So if a clan attacks some clan 10 spots below them, they can't attack them again for 10 days.  If they attack a comparable clan next to them in position, they are free to go at each other every day...even tho this will be a difficult battle and not always winnable.  There's too much top feeding like always.  The system they have with mana already shows that number of wars is not a deciding factor of rank, so why encourage it?

                Wow.<br>Must be hard to try to develop a set of rules for this game, even more this server.<br>Basically, how do you create an event for a group of players where most of the top players are all stacked into a handfull of clans, and yet make it fun for the entire server?   <br>If you just make it a normal war based on strenght and ressources, then the final ranking will reflect the usual ranking, and so the war is predictable.   If you make more constraining rules to protect smaller clans or create upsets, then yes, people will be upset...<br>It doesn't help that top players are so little spread out, but then again, if you are in a clan that finish with top rewards each event, why would you leave?<br>A league system would be more logical, but we know that our server can't handle leagues, because no one would want to be in top league with the big canons.<br>So, back to square 1.  I think MT is trying.  I think the war was not so bad.   <br>In fact, i think the <em>initial rules</em> worked pretty well, and the problems are created by the new rules: the +10 honor at reset, and the removal of the no-attack penalty.   The only trouble with the initial rules was the DAY ONE blunder that should have gotten addressed pronto.<br><br>Anyways, here is for positive thining, what rules i like:<br>1- death is permanent for the war: makes it important to remove dinoz, gives power back to Scale, etc...<br>2- Full heal for defenders.  Now defenders make a difference.

                After a war we should have a feedback thread, where everyone can post his/her opinion on the war rules, how good they worked, where the problems are, etc. Would be nice if someone knowledgable then distilled the main ideas/complaints to a short notice and send them to the devs. If this is not possible: sad, but then all the discussing here is useless as well.<br><br>I think Venar is correct, imo the old rules + some kind of forgiving mechanic that would enable clans to stop losing honor even when having low honor would work best (mby something like: a diplomacy option (nap) -&gt; you can't attack a clan (and gain no mana when countering someone) but also do not lose honor by not attacking). Also it would be good, if everyone started at 150 honor or the max honor was at 150 (when we talk about 5 honor each day). This way the first phase of honor gathering would be shorter. It is interesting for some days, but gets repetetive after mby 8 days.

                @Venar: the main problem MT has that they can not upset those spending RL on the game.<br>Otherwise, the solution would be pretty simple: register dinoz before the war, and have a cap on how much one clan can register based on level (not a sum, a more complicated formula). And of course give prizes only to the members who actually participated in the war.<br>But if this happens, people who bought themselves many high level dinoz will complain since they can not use them all or have to spend even more money to compensate for their weaker clanmates not being able to register enough dinoz (and in a way, they are justified to do this).

                If small numbers of clan will rebuild it is not important if they put repair teams or not. Big clans will simple not have 3 wars per day. And middle clans that rebuild in order to have fast war will try to kill you asap before somebody kill them. So the top 5 clans maybe will give you some more time if you put repair crew and write about it. But all other clans under them not.

                The reason the midclans are being attacked as soon as they rebuild (currently anyway) is that for the most part all the castles are down.  There really isn't anything to attack.  The last time we declared war there were only about 6 castles up for 50 clans.

                And the reason why most of the time mid clans have their castle down, is because they got attacked by the big clans - sometimes even before they could make more mana than a takedown would cost them. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br><br>In addition, the clans midclans are able to attack to gain mana, are also targets of the bigger clans.<br><br>It's not easy to be in a mid clan. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"><br><br>Wonder how low level clans must feel, since they have much more clans on their back. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/eek.gif">

                Well as it stands some clans are staying down so long that the rep penalty disappears. If clans would just keep building then at some point they would stop being attacked. if you built say 7 times in a row that would give all top clans -10 rep to attack.  Then it allows 4 days before any would probably attack again.<br><br>Just a thought.

                If you look at page 2 of the declaration page, about 90% of them time, none of those clans are up, and on page 3 the only clans that are ever up are Lost Cause and HUN (about 100% of the time lol).  <br>So yes, fairly boring for ranks 15-25...  The only clans on 2nd page that actually rebuild are ranks 21-27 (Death's Enclave to Unicorns), so essentially, the weaker of those like DDR and Guerros only have 2-3 targets...<br><br>One of the issues here is prizes.  If Epoq changed them so that 21-30 were actually good, and maybe added some small prize for 31-35 or something, maybe we'd see some more clans rebuilding.

                Yeah, there is no reason to fight if you won't get into top20.<br><br>Top25 or top30 — doesn't matter, the only interesting thing there is an epic item. Fighting more for 25 demon tickets? I'd rather sacrifice one of my gatherers and it won't cost me a penny.<br><br>Constant rebuilding to protect yourself against top clan for a few days? It will cost 5,000*N gold in ingredients plus (0.95^N)*X mana. If there is 20 clans stronger than you, it will cost 100,000 in ingredients and will reduce your amount of mana to 35%!

                wow....the war is starting to be so boring <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/evil.gif">. A good MT initiative was turn into nothing by (almost all) the many wise players who always complain (about the rules, about the players, about the tactics one is using....and will criticize my message). Now some of you just made a new very good tactic....kill the war.<br>I intended to write to all clan leaders form <strong>first 6-8 clans </strong> and ask to stop hammering us, but maybe I will just change our goal and <strong>ask them public to use a lower level defense, we could attack them, win and the next day they should win ....ROOT wants to have some fun.</strong><br>Enjoy!

                There are a lot of complaints about the new Mana war, but there are also a lot of god ideas about how to improve it for next time.<br><br>Overall I like the idea with the Mana war and I think that many clans do the same. If we look pass the bugs and other issues with the rules this could have been a great event.<br><br>But as I see it the main problem is that there are by far not enough active clans on this server to make this system flow as it should be. To make this system work in a decent way there need to be at least 100+ active clans. There are now 63 clans in this war and I feel that its only the top 25 that are trying to find wars to fight while the rest has pretty much give up.<br><br>So with only that few active clans and the heavy farming at 00.00 it obvious that this war has become pretty boring. But the clan farming at 00.00 is nothing new, so we cant complain about that since farming has been used in all the previous clan wars that I have taken part of and that is now 7.<br><br>I think that MT overestimated themselves and thought that their new system would attract much more clans the the previous events. But it did not.<br><br>I would not say that this war and system is a major fail since MT cant force more people to start playing the game and create serious clans. But I would say its a somewhat fail and that MT should by now know better and should know more about their own game and how to make things flow.<br><br>I dont have any constructive criticism or any great ideas on how to improve the system for the next clan war, I leave that to those who are brighter then <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif">

                <cite>Well as it stands some clans are staying down so long that the rep penalty disappears. If clans would just keep building then at some point they would stop being attacked. if you built say 7 times in a row that would give all top clans -10 rep to attack. Then it allows 4 days before any would probably attack again.<br><br>Just a thought.</cite><br><br>Yes of course if ALL clans rebuild. Cause if not with this nice +10 honur per day you will be raped again and again. And for clan with a strength around 18-19 it will end with at least 10 attacks or even more. Losing every time 5% of mana and 5k for rebuild is not very good for ranking.<br><br>It is classical Prisoner's dilemma <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                The war was ill conceived, and even more poorly executed. 19 days to ride out.<br><br>As I and other predicted, it would not be the last 2-4 days of the war that nobody would rebuild. Rather, it is the last 26 days that most clans would not be rebuilding their walls.<br><br>And for those who think this is "mid-level" clans or clans on page 2, at this moment:<br>Top 20 rank -- 5 castles up<br>21 to 40 rank -- 1 castle up (DDR)<br>41 to 60 rank -- 2 castles (HH &amp; LC)<br><br>The ennui pervades from top to bottom.

                lol i feel sorry for MT.. <br>whatever they do- people complain.. <br>I think this war is much better than the other wars, although some changes need to be made as some of you pointed out (to keep more clans with castle up). hope they figure something before the next war..

                I would say the honor system is good, but needs some changes:<br><br>1. <strong>those, who have a built up castle gain +1 honor for every 5 hours</strong>. - this would remove the quick rebuilds just before midnight<br><br>2. <strong>no honor gain for simply attacking somebody</strong>. honor is generated by time, and by won war. if you win a war against a lower ranked: 0 honor. if you win against a higher ranked (either by attack or counter attack) : you gain some honor. and if you was attacked and can defend yourself for a higher ranked: gain some honor<br><br>3. <strong>increase the penalty for attacking lower ranked clans</strong>: for example -1 for every 2 positions. (and this time the declaration of the war will give the honor penalty immediately!<br><br>4. the penalty for <strong>attacking the same clan</strong>: I would change to -20 for 3 days and -10 for the 4th day.  <br><br>5. I would give a (maybe cumulative) penalty of -5 for <strong>attacking ANY clan, that lost a war in the last 24hrs</strong>.<br><br>these would be fair, but <strong>would lead to LESS war</strong> between the clans (0-1 for each day), and those would be fought between the same blocks (Every clan would fight with those are positionoed 3-4 higher and 1-5 lower, I think)<br><br>so those, who would like to fight LOTS would became bored..  but war would be again about planned attacks, not the opportunity-hunting..<br><br>-d2k-

                Our clans in 3xth ranks kept rebuilding castle at mid-night to hope to get 30th rank by beating others, but when  we rebuild our castle, we are attacked by the first ranks clan &amp; lose mana &amp; get lower ranks...<br>It is non-sense to rebuild the castle, nor motivation to do so.<br><br>It can solve the problem (of only a few battles) simply by making some punishments for clan not rebuilding (e.g. mana reduces), or even better, bonus after rebuild castles (+ve reinforcement has greater motivation impacts than punishment), e.g. reward some mana per hr within the day (so that spread the attack time by not only the server 0:00 time)<br><br>Otherwise, the dev. effort for the war is lost by only very few battle occurred &amp; very few castles rebuilt until the mana war ends.....

                so if loot attacks us, and they are failing to defeat our defense (in 1 of 1000 wars this <u>could</u> happen, at least technically^^), because we are putting in everything we got, we should be punished for that?<br><br>this would be a bit unfair, don't you think?

                I think that a forced auto build feature could work pretty well. To not take away strategy your castle will be rebuild after 72h. More clans up for all the war, you have to calculate a bit more when to stay down and when to build up and so on. Last three days of war no one will be up, but hey... Not much of a change there ^^<br><br>Make it free of cost and the smallest clans won't have to waste their precious treasury, they only need a bit patience.

How about a different approach.  <br><br>Example new rule(s) as I see it:<br><br>If an attack is abandoned, the clan keeps the right to attack that same clan again after 4 days. <br>They are not allowed at all to attack that clan again until 96 hours expire (disable the attack entirely).<br><br>THEN if another attack is abandoned against the same clan, they cannot attack for 6 days ect... make it cumulative.  At this time the attacking clan begins to lose honour by abandoning wars, 15 points each time.<br><br>If the attacking clan does not abandon an attack at any time, they lose the right to attack that same clan for the ENTIRE EVENT.<br><br>There would be no honour loss in either case, the ability to attack would instead be punished.<br><br>This will make them think about thier actions and how it affects them.<br><br>Would that not make it "fair"?<br>Would that keep "honourable" clans honourable, and "unorthodox" clans out of the war more days?<br><br>Again, if I see it wrong feel free to explain why.  Ive no problem with that.

                I wonder why it is always 5000 in ingredients to reconstruct the castle. Where is the logic in that? It should be proportional to your mana, so low ranked clans have to pay less and feel more at ease to do it. Isn't that how it was? That was a bad change, mid/top clans probably don't feel it but since this clans have to endure so many defeats, having to pay 5k for every time is non sense.

                <strong>What happen if nobody rebuilt their casttle? </strong>They could not find any target right now. if they rebuilt it, they will attacked immediatly by a strong clan before they could do anything, and lose some mana. If just wait for the right moment (f.e.till the end of the war), they could save their mana, and their postion as well. So I think there is no reason to rebuilt their casttle which ruin the war. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif">

                the mana gain for attacking a small clan is already proportional to its mana (less mana from walls), and thus doing so is very unattractive even with the current rules. so there's no need to connect the mana loss for defeats to rank in any way. just get rid of the whole 5% loss thing, which will also solve the problem of not enough clans rebuilding. <br><br>i know (or at least i think i know) that it was implemented to give an incentive for attacking neighbouring clans and adding some strategic aspects, but from what i've seen so far, it's not really necessary and just makes the war VERY boring.

                If you stop the 5% loss altogether, that would make attacking someone with lots of mana less appealing.<br><br>What I meant by my previous post was, the mana STOLEN from a clan is less if they are ranked X amount of positions lower than you.<br><br>That way if position 15 kills position 40, position 40 would not lose 5% of the little mana they already have. In fact in that example, position 40 shouldnt lose ANY mana. The higher ranked clan still generates mana and if they chose to "bottom-feed", that should be all they get.<br>You should not be faced with rebuilding just to give your mana away before another beatable clan rebuilds.<br><br>Maybe if you could steal 10% or more from a clan 15 positions higher than you, lower ranked clans might be inclined to give it a try.  <br>There NEEDS to be a danger for the highest ranked clans, because the lower ranked clans face certain death every day with no penalty to the bigger clans.  Honour penalty?  Please... that has proven to not be a penalty at all.

                There is no real incentive to get a place in the 7th - 10th ranking. It is pretty much the same as a place in the top 15. 100 Demon notes aren't really worth fighting for.<br><br>And handing out demon tickets for the lower ranking clans is just plain wrong ^^

                i would not mind seeing spheres handed out to clan members...the market value is still very high for spheres..so if lets say each clan member in the top ten got a random sphere that would do many things:<br>1) incentive to finish in one of those places due to the value a sphere could have<br>2) lower the market value of certain spheres<br>3) incentive to remove inactive clan members and bring in active members <br><br>i also think the spheres should be random..so someone who does all the work may get a wood, where someone who does nothing gets a water (again going back to the pursuit of active clan members).<br><br>I know you all might think this is weird, but i rather see prizes that are randomly valued base. (IE you could get a prize worth 300k or a prize worth 50k)

                here is something to discuss:<br><br>1. the new war system is better than the old one: it is worth to defend, so there are fights (not only empty walls) everywhere<br><br>2. but because of the defense is as week as its weakest part, <u>the defending dinoz will be from the top3-5 strongest member of the clan</u><br><br>3. there is no way that these dinoz can be defeated other than with an equal strong dinoz (<u>this means the attackers will be from the top 5-6 members too</u><br><br>4. other than playing scouts/lemmings: <strong>how can the 90% of a clan participate in the current war system</strong>? - I think this is a very important question! In the old system lots of players combined could take out top defenders like 1 to 10 by ganging up. now this is not an option (if that was good or not is not the subject of my post)<br><br>So, <strong>without being able to fighting in the war, what can  the not so strong, but very active members do for their clan, and how could they enjoy the game</strong>?<br><br>thank you<br><br>-d2k-

                I think one option is to limit the number of automatic heals for defenders. Currently it is 8 + some other amount where it declines each time (is it 9 more?)? What if it was reduced to 4 heals + 3 declining amounts (75%, 50%, 25%).<br><br>This way, lots of smaller dinoz could still overpower some strong dinoz. Not as easily as before, but it would still be possible (assuming the defender is not online and rehealing with breads and such).

                I agree with you druid2k. On all points here. <br>Bace, I think it would make sense for that also. 17 attacks to reduce the healing just isn't practical. <br><br>Also, I think it would be nice for some disincentive to be added for attacking teams. For example, if an attack team survives a fight, don't let it reenter to attack again with full health. I'm not sure if this can be implemented or not (you'd have to freeze the group together after it attacks or something so leaders cant be changed for workaround? I'm not really sure, but I'm willing to bet someone could creatively troubleshoot this).<br><br>But, I'm guessing re-attacking disincentives would be unpopular.

                just a thought, not  asuggestion: back in summer I've discussed with Jeno76 what would be a good war system (long before the current rules came out<br><br>- we've agreed that defense is the key part for this. it must be worthy to defend (and not by getting more  <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_xp.gif"> <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br><br>- the current system is good in that: dinoz not really die, so they can defend: if they are lucky, even repel some attackers!<br><br>- we were thinking about a system, where <br><br><br>1. the <strong>castle's defense limit</strong> could be set by the clan's owner<br><br>2. the level of the clan's castle would be a number between 20 and 50 <br><br>3. this would be a value visible to everybody<br><br>4.<strong> the clan cannot put dinoz into defense with level greater than the level of the castle</strong><br><br>5. <strong>the clan cannot be attacked by any team, that contains a dino with level greater than the castle's level</strong>!<br><br>(this value can be changed only a few times, f.e. once per week, and not be in effect immediately: like a 1 day cool-down, while there cannot be attacks or defenses involving the clan - so no quick changes would be possible) - rules like this (and others, I didnt think of) are have to be set/cleared..)<br><br><u>what would be the result of this?</u><br><br>- the war between the top clans wont be affected, I think. everybody would set their limit to 50, and all dinoz could take part as usual.<br><br>- the war between the mid clans are only affected by a bit: they would choose a number less than 50, so a weaker one could attack the stronger (mid clan) with full strength, but a clan that has 90% level 35 dinoz wont use its all-powerful top player to crush its equal level opponents with his 3 level 50s<br><br>- the war between top clans and mid clans would have the biggest difference: the weaker clan is unaffected, but the stronger clan would be limited to attack only with lower level dinoz.  this would mean that either the top players would develop decent mid level dinoz too, or the not-so-top members of the clan would have to handle the mid clan's<br><br>so in this system:<br><br>- <u>there will be much more interesting combats between mid clans and top clans</u> (mid clans would have a chance against top clans, because their top dinoz (level 30-40) wont face full sphered level 50s<br><br>- <u>there would be some strategy involved</u> (setting the limit would need a wise decision)<br><br>- the mid members of the clans would have biggest role (now their role is "doing nothing"<br><br>this is just an idea, I think it never be coded in this game, I (we) were just wondering what would be a good system.. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br>(<strong>for me the definition of the "good system" is the system, that makes the most player take part in the war</strong>)<br><br><u>+1 more idea to think about:</u> (<strong>castle repairers -&gt; healer dinoz</strong>)<br>- I think the castle's repair team was a good idea (something that involves dinoz, that cannot fight in the war)<br>- What would be if these dinoz would affect the healing of the defender dinoz? not auto healing, but (quick) healing based on the "healer" dinoz (like healing the defenders 1 HP / 30 seconds for every healers)<br>- I would maximize the number of defenders put in per player too (like 3  max)<br>- and this would be the max number of healers to (so a player could put maximum of 3 dinoz in the castle: either to heal the defenders or to defend<br>- a 50 member castle would have about 30-50 defenders and 100-120 healers maybe?<br>- the current delay of 1 attack / 30 seconds would work fine with them, and if somebody needs, there would be still                   opportunity to heal the wounded by bread and like..<br><br>these are - again - <strong>just ideas to try to make the clan war not to be a war between 5 member of a clan against 5 different player of an other clan</strong>.. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br><br>what do you think?<br><br>-d2k-

                I would add to druid2k's proposal that when attacking a higher ranked clan, the strength of the castle is ignored.<br>This would stop a lot of possible unorthodox tactics, it would still allow strong clans to beat down weaker clans that infiltrate themselves before them, but would protect weaker clans, who don't want to play in the upper leagues, against the monster clans out there.<br>Personally, I neve liked or understood people spending 100s of euros on a game, but you can not simply take away their level 50 dinoz like that. That is simply not fair.<br><br>To sum up my opinion, the game has 3 major problems right now:<br>1) medium and small clans are bored of the events, as they are cannon food for the big clans and nothing more =&gt; they need protection from clans much stronger then they are<br>2) medium players in big clans are bored as well, since they are practically useless for their clans; yeah, there is scouting and such, but is that really fun for anybody? =&gt; a clan attacking always with the same members and/or dinoz must be somehow punished for doing this, this should not be a valid tactic<br>3) the same clan (or it reincarnation) is winning every single event for quite some time now. This is never good for a game, if somebody can be so strong, the game needs changes or the competition will get bored and leave. This is again a tricky thing, as I said before, it isn't fair or productive to screw these guys out of their effort and/or money. Honestly, I can not come up with a good solution for this either

                hmm.. id like to disagree that the def part of this event is too OP atm. this game is VERY much luck based and from watching VA fights I have seen countless times we lost/won just because of that. but i agree that with this system its more impossible for a 30s clan to take out a 40+ clan - as you said before, they cant gang up - i am hover not sure if that is actually a BAD thing. come to think of it.. those with the 50s have played this game A LONG time before those with 30s - so it's only logical that they are stronger and thus not in the same "league".

                @Druid, you might be right. At last COTC it was actually interesting to watch the waves of small dinoz that went after the big guys. Win or Lose but they still had a better fighting chance than in this mana war - but there was a different upset for the big guys there - as only few of their masters could enjoy the event due to their cap number being VERY limited.<br><br>I think its pretty impossible to make a fair fight between some e.g. 25 masters of 40+lvls and 25 masters of ~30lvls. In any case their dinoz will die out faster. So imo the only way to have interesting fights is between somewhat similar strength opponents - maybe that could be addressed somehow. I still hope one day there will be a non-clan related event with much smaller groups of masters and a big competition. Because let's face it.. our server has it's limitations from the audience size and strength disproportion.

It is no fun for smaller clans to get repeatedly stomped over by clans they have no chance against.<br><br>2.  It is not fair to penalise clans for getting stronger by forcing them to fight tougher opponents while lesser clans get easier fights and walk off with the prizes.<br><br>In the past we have had several attempts to solve #1 which have ended up as a fail because of #2.  CotC1, CotC2 and CW5 (to an extent) are all examples of this in various ways.<br><br>There is only one idea I have had that manages to solve both of the above simultaneously.  Have a war split in two halves, where the first half is fought as a regular clan war and the second half is divided into divisions depending on where you finished in the first half.  But everyone in division 1 gets a better prize than everyone in division 2, who get a better prize than everyone in division 3 and so on.  Not perfect, but might end up approximating a fair and interesting war.

                <cite>look at the WAR tab: <br>- only about 10 clans are fighting hard <br>- only about 30 clans fought more than a few times<br>- and only 65 clans registered at all<br><br>I think these numbers are alarming.</cite><br><br>I wouldn't say that's a huge problem.  30 clans potentially represents 1500 players, which would actually be quite a large proportion of the active player base.  Obviously not all clans have 50 members and most clans don't have 100% participation in PvP events (or even close to it) but my point is I don't think you can draw too many conclusions by looking at the raw numbers like this.

                just to point out: The names i listed were just examples to let other guys know, who also witnesed the BH-OPnes, what happened to us. No hard feelings, they didnt do anything wrong, but this is certainly not what it should be about. And there i´ve been, laughing at some suggestions to limit Blackholes per fight... hahaha<br><br>on a side note: Is it REALLY just because of the fight-timer, or did they increased the probability of blackhole triggering somewhen in the recent past ?

                I like druid's idea about castle leveling, that should introduce more fun and action.<br><br>Another suggestion is that repairing dinoz should accumulate some repairing potential (say, 0-20 per dinoz, 1 per hour) and that potential could be unleashed by the dinoz master whenever he wants to (so it is controllable and may significantly affect the war). The potential is lost when dinoz is removed from the team but while he is in the team it keep growing.

                In the united states prostitution is illegal. When I see things like this happening a joke comes to mind.<br><br>The joke went. <em>If cops raided a hotel room were a known prostitute is working that <strong>EDITED </strong>will be arrested. To prevent that from happening, the <strong>EDITED</strong>carries around a video camera with her at all times. When the cops raid the place she can tell the officers that they were making a <strong>EDITED </strong>and the money offered was her payment for the movie.<br><br>It is not illegal to video record a porno.</em><br><br>Moral of the story. Calling something by a different name may make it legal, but that does not mean it wont be frowned upon. In my mind a strategy is being played out and I do not see how it breaks any rules. I just would not want to be the people caught doing this.<br><br>Another example is this post lol. The rules say  <em>Any kind of racist or pornographic topic: directly a definitive ban.</em> I am not trying to be graphic in my joke I am trying to make a point... nor am I going into specific details about anything "graphic". However as gray areas are known in this game it is not up to the players to decide what is legal or what isnt.<br><br><span class="tid_mod"><cite>4. Rude or insulting posts are unacceptable.

                Another little story I have for you.<br><br>At an old church the priest would turn up or down the thermostat every weekend. On Saturdays the first group of older women who came in would turn the thermostat up while the second group of younger women who came in would turn it down. On Sundays the first group that came in would turn it up and the second group would turn it down. This was just repeated non-stop each weekend, irregardless of the season.<br><br>One day the priest asked the congregation what is the ideal temperature of the church? A large portion of the group replied you should turn it up since warmer temperatures are better for older people with brittle bones and aching joints, and the older people make up the majority of the congregation. The rest replied that you should turn it down since it is far easier to put a coat or sweater on when it is too cold then it is to shed layers of clothes during the summer when you had no layers to shed.<br><br>The priest decided the best alternative was to leave the parish so he did not have to hear all these women whine all the time.<br><br>Take this game as this situation. You will never make everyone happy. It is impossible when the groups are so different.  So I do not believe there are any real right or wrong answers.

                poqemon, the MT reply on those actions gave the green light for friendly war tactics to be used as they are much more easier, cheaper and effective than going the hard way. So there is nothing more left to add from the community as the views we discussed before are the same for this situation.<br><br>Atm I am not sure weather to be proud of being a member of VA as the brave clan who is continuously trying to take down RAK, LOOT and other strong clans - without any arrangements, or to feel like a fool for punching my head against their castle wall (Id actually be glad if that was the case, if my dinoz were able to punch their wall). Still it's more fun and interesting to not grind the numbers but make some actual fights. So I don't regret our clans policy.<br><br>Still, rewards are also important.. as we have to think of our dinoz. They deserve good things. So in conclusion, I am sure that the war is far from over and we will definitely see more arrange/non-arrange fights.

                ROFL...nice stories, Slyfox, and I agree that they're good examples about this game. <br><br>Still, the mana war is a remarkable improvement from the original clan war, but is still vulnerable to exploits. I mean, if Rakshasa doesn't mind, I wouldn't be surprised if some clan asked Rakshasa to give a clan a piggie back ride worth about 7000 mana + the attacks on the castle. Yet again, we return to Slyfox's 2nd moral, nothing is perfect. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                @ HugoMVP:<br>1. since I am on Dinorpg I sow allies helping each other and I believe there is nothing wrong in doing it. Allies need to do that. Loot did it also for other clans during the time and nothing to be ashamed there <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif">. And believe me I would have been silent if that as your case...even if yu di that3- times during this war.<br>2. my post was looking for the reaction of this server "so-called" community against another way of farming...<br><br>The only problem when you do that is that some will never forget that. They might forget the great LBT defence, but they won't forget the low way you guys get into top 10. So congrats for the great achievement!<br><br>Too bad that even if they had so much experience from FR server, MOTION TWIN did change so little to prevent this things.<br><em>my last post on the farming thing</em>

                I for one would like to see that for the next war:<br>1. mana gained from hitting walls is gone =&gt; should stop farming<br>2. clans should lose mana based on how many successfull defenses they have done, with a minimum(5%) and maximum(50%) =&gt; would force you to put up some defence, would reward you for holding out for a long time and would reduce the uber-usage of scouts/item drainers<br>3. auto-heal needs to be reduced; have a max number of free health points per dino that can be recovered in one war =&gt; reduces few stong dinoz based attack and defense<br>4. if more clans attack the same clan, no honor is lost, but the won many is shared between the involved clans according the number of attacks =&gt; should limit friendly blocking attacks, would encourage offensive alliances, but would limit the gain (thus you would use it on strong clans, but not week ones)

                good ideas, i like all of them.<br>especially number 2, since right now, lets be honest, most members of our clans are "useless" (despite scouting).<br>Sounds harsh, but its the truth, this is more or less a topplayers war.<br><br>topplayers meaning the strongest of eachs clan. This lead to even more expensive wars for the stronger guys, why the weaker guys cant even help properly, even if they desperately liked to.

                of course, but since theres the bubble nerf, they are taking more than just 10 hp damage per fight. Their tier 1 defensive ability, and thats why we all trained them, remain, but they wont last as long as they do now, depending on your BH luck.

                How about losing mana for losing an attack? I think this might have been mentioned before. In that case, it is courtesy to the person who said it before me. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/redface.gif"> <br><br>Returning the honour gain to +5 a day is recommended. Or lift restriction to 300. <br><br>All these ideas should be discussed via mibbit chat to Epoq. Most of them are pretty good and we might expect those rules in another mana war. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                Congratulations all. I would like to add some <strong>more suggestions</strong>:<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_default.gif"> If there are mana<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> gains per war, they should be capped at something like 20% of the clan's current mana<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif">.  The war should be a marathon and not a sprint.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_default.gif"> If there are mana<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_mana.gif"> gains per battle, make them based on <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_xp.gif"> earned... and not based on wall kicks.  This would mean a successfully defended wall can earn mana too.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_default.gif"> The number of attacks on undefended walls should incur an honor penalty (or something) if there are not enough dead dinoz on defense.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_default.gif"> End the bonuses/penalties for castles being up or down <strong>at reset</strong>... change it to a 6 hour castle auto-rebuild countdown from the moment the wall falls... this would spread out the wars throughout the day, add new strategic opportunities, and reduce the server load around reset.

                Silly me... I forgot two <strong>suggestions</strong>:<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_default.gif"> The second attacker penalty should expire after 6 hours, and not last the length of the war.<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_default.gif"> The 4 day honor penalty for attacking the same castle, should be greatly increased if the target clan is in the most recent 6 clans in the attacking clan's win list.

                Really enjoyed this mana war.  It wasn't perfect, but the free healing really allowed for a lot of battles to take place.  We won many tough battles, and lost some tough ones as well.  I just hope there is some recovery time before CotC starts up.

                I like druid2k's idea changing how clans get mana:<cite>also, mana is generated in every built up castle (some constant, like 50mana, or 0.5% in every hour)</cite>However, I think the idea could be tweaked... especially with the idea that clans don't lose mana for losing wars.<br>How about:<br><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/map_default.gif"> Clans could convert ingredients into mana, but it takes time and their castle has to remain up during these mana conversions.<br><br>This would make collecting ingredients more valuable again... and would make the war about keeping castles up for as long as possible.<br><br>I would combine this with my previous suggestion of getting mana ~equal to XP gained in wars (to encourage good battles and defense)... and have <strong>XP and ingredient conversion being the only way of getting more mana</strong>... and no way of losing mana.

                Go Umpas! <br><br>We have made a drastic improvement and it's mostly thanks to mtp85 and champ. Their defences were at most times so impenetrable that even the big clans were scratching their heads at what to do! By that, I mean see mtp85's videos. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"> <br><br>Also, well done to Rakshasa for overkilling the 1st result. They are indeed the new Cloak and Dagger clan now, which used to dominate quite a few past events. <br><br>Lastly, well done to all clans who contributed. Thanks to this mana war system, we all could have a go at launching attacks and seeing how effective our dinoz were. <br><br>Loppermann is indeed impatient suggesting that the COTC begin next week. Give us all about 1-2 months break. Add a few mini-events in that time, too...or new content. It's about time Carushmesh was seen. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif">

                This war was an improvement in many ways and a step in the right direction overall. Many players have been waiting for a long time for penalty-free wars, where putting up dinoz to defend was a net gain for the clan and not a detriment to its growth.<br><br>Druid2k, Husaurus and others have made some excellent suggestions on how the new war mechanics could be improved. The one sentiment I feel must be highlighted is that <strong>the wars should be enjoyable for as many participants as possible.</strong> Without this, the strain on few members and boredom for most will severely impact the growth of this game in the long run. As a clan leader, one of the most difficult aspects of this game is to find suitable, meaningful and above all enjoyable roles for each clan member regardless of their level. So I implore MT to implement game mechanics and functions for these smaller members that make them important to the overall strategy, if not crucial. A clan will always have its smaller members, whether they are top 30 or top 3.<br><br>The second concern that needs mention is of course the viability of gaming the system versus the benefits of playing "normally". This will always be an issue with new systems, but I hope MT takes the suggestions in this thread and the strategies demonstrated during the war to develop a system in which the incentive for fun outweighs the efficiency of using unorthodox tactics. Not to say that coming up with those strategies isn't fun, but they shouldn't necessarily become a focus.<br><br>Speaking of strategies, we had a great time coordinating our bloc actions this war. Our intent was to make our presence known, and we accomplished that with good results. In the end, oldguard MK, GC and FETE had to show us upstart pups how it's really done, and I am glad you did not allow us to push you from your rightful spots. Our three clans got the spots we deserved this war. A heartfelt thanks to CoG's partners in crime, LBT and Voodoo. We have grown so much since we first started this bloc. I am proud to stand beside you. And the same to our friends elsewhere, you know who you are.<br><br>This has been a great first event for us. CoG would like to thank PL, Axie, DR, RA and FETE for the great fights. A special mention to Umpas for rejuvenating their fighting spirit, and standing strong alone. GDJ, you have and will always be our friends. ROoT, we'll give you a better fight next time around. DE, CB, thanks for the support. BBC, thanks for the surprise takedown, even though you accidentally finished us too early. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"> VA, thanks for making our second to last operation exciting. And last but not least, congratulations to Cookies for their strong finish despite unfortunate early setbacks.<br><br>Here's to a nice long restful break for everyone.

                It say in history: "We have been noticed during the 7th Clan War, finishing in position 8! All the clan members have obtained an epic item: Mana Capsule"<br><br>So this will count as the 7th war? I thought MT was trying to sell this Mana Wars as a separate event from normal wars. Not that I mind, I just thought that we would eventually have a 7th Clan War (hopefully with some of the improvements of mana war).<br><br>As for improvements to mana war itself... I would propose that after one clan declares and defeats another, they can't attack again at all for at least 2 days. Then even some more honour penalties for 3-4 days. I would like to see more ways to win honour, more incentive to stay with castle constructed, Mana generated reformulated (or removed and substituted by something, but at least give more mana for attacking with more dinoz).

                Positives:<br>-Choosing your own ingredients. (and avoiding accidentally declaring war in one click, due to going through the process of picking the ingredients)<br>-Shorter war times (1d15h) <br>-Impossible to undeclared. <br>-Hypno is better.<br>-1-3 vs 3 is a nice measurement against overpowered brave attackers<br><br><br><br>Negatives:  <br>-When you click to declare war, there should be a warning/notification if there is a change in the honor cost from when you click ‘declare’ to when you pay for the war.<br>-the way the mana war is designed, it becomes less about fighting and more about a mana collecting competition. This isn’t fun. There are some ways I can suggest to fix this, but I’m sure others can come up with better ideas. <br>	1: bigger punishments for attacking the same clan. The four-day wait isn’t a long enough wait. Make it longer. (For example, we attacked umpa lumpa several times, which is no fun for them and left a bad taste for us, but because of the way mana war is designed, it was the smart choice for us at the time).  <br>	2: Less honor earned for staying up.<br>	3: Shorter overall length. This is also a disincentive to attack the same clans repeatedly, as well as more fun in my opinion. How short? 3 weeks should be plenty of time and doesn’t allow people to sit at full honor long or at all.<br>-Clearly, no bugs. Start the event on a Monday and have the devs prepared to fix whatever bugs pop up during the day/week. At this point, we all expect bugs.<br>-I’m not sure I like the counter system as it is. It gives little desire to take a risk to try attacking a clan higher than you in strength, but lower than you in reputation. It is already disincentive enough by being stuck at war with them.<br>– Maybe make wars ending automatically at 0:00 no matter when it was declared. This changes the longest wars to lasting 24h. <br> -Black hole is too strong now. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif">

                I hope the topic of war doesn't become the topic of skill Black Hole. I don't have  dinoz with this skill but I know that it rarely works, so I'm against it changes.

                seems like you havent paid attention to the difference between fights with timers and fights to death... in the latter,its only a matter of time until 3 bubbled dinoz start using blackhole. the situation changed... as we had timers,you could count yourself lucky triggering blackhole. Without the timer,you can count yourself lucky if you manage to kill even one kabuki before it starts using Bh (and we all know how broken the rdm generator is... as soon as something triggers for the first time, its much likely to see it getting spammed.)<br>So if you've got an even situation ( e.g. both facing off teams with no or lots of spheres), the only chance to not get BHed over and over is triggering BH yourself, ohr beeing more lucky with ini-spells. And as you might know...something will change regarding initiative very soon... no stacking ini ( if...) and fights to death = blackbole war. easy as that.
