Here it is!</p><p>Please be upstanding for 3 of the toughest competitors the IDT has ever seen:</p><ul><li><strong>Sjefke</strong>, winner of IDT XXXI</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Druid2k</strong>, winner of IDT XXXII</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Bengeldorn</strong>, winner of IDT XXXIII</li></ul><p><img src="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/f/7/a657583c_14.jpg" class="tid_img tid_parsed" style=""></p><p>Without further ado, let me pass you over to the masters themselves for a few words.</p><p><strong>Sjefke</strong><br><cite>I never thought I'd be able to win this one, considering some people that came on my path.<br>It started with picking the team: I was sure about picking my etherwasp and 2 clouds, they all have a good bubble ratio and great invocation skill. The good old kabuki would be useful with his high initiative, spheres and poison. The winks was the hardest to pick, because he isn't poison immune. I've picked him anyway because he had the most HP of the team, a lot of players use the 'no mercy' skill on their dinoz nowadays, so he would be picked last for enemy assaults.<br><br>The original goal was as always, to go for a napo and see where it would end. Maniatiko was the first real test, but he had problems dealing with poison. Luigiemma was the opponent for the group win. His huge torch dinoz looked impressive, but nonetheless it became an easy win for my team. I've fought Jen√∂ 2 times before in IDT and won both matches, but his team was stronger than ever this time. B1onic was the one waiting in the quarter final. A great start from my team triggering early fujin and sveral floods sealed his faith quickly.<br><br>McHalls was the opponent in the semi final, having a pretty much equal team with also 2 fujin clouds. I decided to buy antidote and equip it on my winks now I got this far. My team won again and for the first time they were in the final, where Norbert (SUMMR) was the opponent.<br><br>The start of the fight was horrible, for the first time this tournament double face on my kabuki fell the wrong way. Norbert's team started furiously, my only luck was that his cloud didn't trigger fujin. Halfway the fight, while my team appeared to get beaten, came the reversal. After 2 floods and fujin quickly after each other, my team was back in the race and didn't give it away anymore.<br><br>Of course there was luck involved in a few fights, but everybody knows that's part of the game! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br></cite></p><p><strong>Druid2k:</strong><br><cite>My choice was simple: I won the 30th dojo, and because the format didnt change, I selected the same team (do not change a winning formula). And it worked! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>The same format, same team and they won again!! I could do some deep analysis about 'why', but I'd surely miss something, so I'll leave it to others, or as a mystery <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> <br>I love fights between teams of 4-5-(6?). It seems chaotic, but it's actually more strategic than it seems.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br></cite></p><p><strong>Bengeldorn</strong><br><cite>In a 5 vs. 5 tournament, I believe Fujin and Flood are the strongest skills. With consumables not being allowed, immunity to poison is very important. Especially when poison can't be canceled and magic items (Temporal Manipulator) are allowed.<br>With these parameters, I picked my rocky Rune Walker and my kabuki Hairy Copper (as usual), because those two are my only dinoz that are immune to poison and have Flood.<br>My two cloudoz are picked for Fujin. I usually pick my demon softpig Baby Longtooth, because it's immune to poison, can deal good damage (active and passive), has a good amount of hit points and I don't have other poison immune dinos with Flood. With Baby Torch and Baby Longtooth both being red in color, and both starting their name with "Baby", I (un-)fortunately had Baby Torch selected.<br>In the end, this IDT will stay in my memory, because of my "mistake" in the team selection, but turning out in winning this IDT. <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":tid_happy:" class="tid_ico"><br></cite></p><p>Congratulations to everyone who participated in the Dojo Tournament and congratulations once again to our champions! We take this opportunity to announce the format for IDT 36 and 37:</p><p><img src="http://imgup.motion-twin.com/twinoid/8/c/8487fde9_14.jpg" class="tid_img tid_parsed" style=""></p><p>Loads of time to perfect your team! Good Luck!</p>
