                What is going on here?! Everything is delayed, postponed or omited on our server! There is no war, no message summing up last dojo, no missions which are availible on French server for a long time. There are many mistakes in translation. To cheer us up we get 2 irmas and a French-speaking gnome, whose quest is not even ready yet! I've been playing this game for 2,5 years, and the organization now is the worst ever. I'm just speaking for myself, but I think many players think the same way. I've put some money in this game, so I think I can demand efforts from MT. Looking at the accounts of top players, they must have spent few THOUSAND EURO. So you should better try harder, because this Snowplough I'm not buying coins. And I think I'm not alone.

                As someone who has purchased in every Snowplough event and had my limit removed for the past ones because of wanting to spend a lot of Snowplough, I too will be abstaining from this one. <br>I've had a mail unanswered since July 8th. On November 7th I got this response: <cite>We got to the bottom of this via PM, didn't we? I hope so, otherwise I owe you a massive apology for not replying for so long!!!<br><br>Speak soon,<br>Epoq</cite> I brought it up in chat several times and I still have yet to get a response. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"><br><br>Communication seems to have improved somewhat with Epoq, but 5 months of waiting and the only response I get is a sad apology... it is going to mean I am not a paying player anymore. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"> This lack of response is fine for a game that is free. So I will just treat it as such. <br><br>I also asked if we could start a DinoRPG/MT group on Kiva in either September or October. I also never received a response for that.

                We on the english server always draw the short end of the stick... Epoq is great but he's got a lot on his back taking care of so many games at the same time, it's impossible for him to run things smoothly and it won't happen. I think it's absurd  to have this prices in a game that only has 1 person taking care of it and you're opinion is not heard, you get what the french users decide and shut up, so my last coins were bought a long time ago as well. <br><br>At least until they decide to do something and not always throw Epoq to the wolves to hear and bear with our complaints...

                Well, why I don't like either how this game is run, this might be the best period ever. We got a lot of new contents, some of them at the same time as the french, that never happened before.<br>There is a lot of reason to complain, but less then before. And that is an improvement.

                I think we have it pretty good in DinoRPG.<br><br>A lot has happened in the past few months.  You choose your level of involvement, so theres plenty to do no matter who you are.<br><br>The biggest problem I have is my limited understanding of the game mechanics, and my inability to buy <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> as of late to extend my fun learning. <br><br>I'm not in it for glory, or to be the first or best.  (I've had enough of that elsewhere...) I'm in it to enjoy seeing it evolve. If it didn't change once in a while, most of you wouldn't be here anymore.<br><br>Sure there are problems, nobodys gonna argue against that.  But at least we get something new often enough to keep it entertaining.  Epoq is the messenger at the mercy of the developers.  I wouldn't want that job.<br>Thats just my perspective of course. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/wink.gif"><br><br>You want a huge disappointment?  Turn back the clock a few years, and play my account on Formulawan only to see it completely abandoned by the developer after spending hundreds of $ on it.<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/evil.gif">

                I would strongly disagree that this is an all time low. <br>I see that the management is not brilliant to say the least and I agree that Epoq has too much on his plate to do maintain a stable and quality service of this game.<br>I think that this overkill of new stuff or what not is a huge flaw from MT's side. If you want to expand, get new ppl to do that. Not at the cost of losing your trusted customers in hopes of gaining new ones.

                Sorry guys, but I have to disagree with the first post:<br><br>- we have communication (forum-responses and chat with Epoq). even answers by PM sometimes..<br><br>- we have tons of new contents (nimbao, nimbao2, chen, gluom, monster hunt, <br><br>- we have fun contents/contests (halloween (which had a surprise prize for every participant (and I missed it <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/nooo.gif"> ), film contest, war-video contest.. the goblins..<br><br>- we had survey about what we would like: what kind of dojo we want, when and what kind of war shall be...<br><br>- modification on the forum rules about spoilers (something that even the FR server dont have) - which make this site's forum even better..<br><br>- etc<br><strong><br>so I think this site works great, Epoq do his best, and this site was never this good in communication</strong> - the problem is that he is only one person, with to much things to do..

                Are things good or bad? It depend on who you talk to and what perspective that person has on the game.<br><br>One big problem I see is that the community seem to rather content with most things. But content is not the same thing as <u>very content</u>. In most dictionaries that I looked in the word <u>content</u> is mostly used when you actually are not happy about things <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"> Content is kinda like saying that something is decent, but it could be much better.<br><br>DinoRpG is both a free play game and has the option of buying gold from MT. Since you can buy stuff for real money MT are obligated to follow what is called <u>The Consumer Act</u> or <u>Consumer Law</u>. This law protects the consumer (us) and gives us the right to complain about a product that is not up to standard. <br><br>The stronger the community are the better. A strong gaming community has the ear of the devs. DinoRpG has a rather weak community, hence MT dont tend to listen much to what we have to say.<br><br>When you offer a service you must consider the consumers happiness. A happy consumer is a happy spender, while a unhappy consumer is a pain in the butt (<strong>Thats me</strong>) <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/biggrin.gif"> <br><br>As a company that is providing a service its totally unacceptable that the consumer has to wait for several months before they get an answer to a mail that they sent the support or the devs. Its totally unacceptable that when such answer arrives its often not even a answer to the question you sent them to begin with.<br><br>Either MT has one poor employee that is handling the support and he gets flooded with work and cant deal with that, hence the late replies. Or MT just ignores the majority of mails and questions that we ask about.<br><br>As a consumer we have the right to make demands. Demands such as being told about changes in advance, be given straight answers and not have to wait for months, to be able to rely on the information that we are given, rely on the game itself.<br><br>I have played this game for a fairly long time, and there are players who has been playing much longer then me. And I must say that the above statement has never been followed by MT during my years as a DinoRpG gamer.<br><br>* We are often told about changes rather late or we hear about it from a second hand source.<br><br>* We are seldom given straight answers, we usually have to wait a long time without any decent explanation to why.<br><br>* At times the information that we are given is wrong or changed after a while.<br><br>* The game itself is not stable due to all the updates.<br><br>These are just some of the things that MT is not handling in a mannered way.<br><br>I feel for Epoq, he has a very difficult job and some people are upset. But dont be upset, its not Epoqs fault. He is just MTÂ´s messenger boy/scapegoat and he is the one who is forced to bring us bad news or apologize on behalf of MT.<br><br>I think MT is in dire need of someone who can handle their public relations with their customers....

                Having played a lot (and I do mean a lot, probably 25+) MMORPGs and browser games down the years I have come to the conclusion that in the long term the players are never happy.  There will always be complaints about bugs, or the slow pace of new content, or that the players aren't listened to, or game imbalances, or cheaters etc no matter what.  If the devs improve in one area, they will get praise in the short term, before players move onto the next thing on the list.  Some games tend to have more vocal and demanding players, while others have more docile and accepting ones, but this seems to have little to do with the actual quality of the game.<br><br>I have no idea if any of you play Runescape, but that is probably the most stable, bug-lite, massive and progressive game I have ever seen yet the community is one of the most bitter out there.  On the other hand I have played games (that I won't name) that are fundamentally flawed, but every hint of a complaint on the forum is immidiately shouted down by a chorus of fanboys.<br><br>In the long term, if players are truly happy then they will keep playing, if they are not happy then they will stop playing.  After all, this is something we all do for fun.  The minute I stop enjoying the time I spend on here my activity will start to drop dramatically and soon I would likely stop playing altogether.  Players that rant and rave about everything under the sun, but a year later are still playing are just kidding themselves to be honest.<br><br>For the record Runescape has over 10 million active players after 10 years whereas most of the unnamed bad games are usually dying or completely dead if I check back to them several months after quitting.  In the end, if the devs want to see how good a job they are doing, that's the best measure they can use.

                I think things are looking up in this server. Things could be worse, but overall I'm pretty satisfied. We don't seem to be lagging behind the French server so much, and there is more communication now. Epoq is doing a very good job IMO, it's just a pity there's only one of him to be admin for several MT games... it's impossible for him to cover every little issue that arises.<br><br>I don't see the war delay as a big problem really, I'd much rather wait a couple of weeks and play something that works than have a rushed version now.<br><br>I'm struggling to think of a time when this server has had it better really.

                Are you sure? Do you remember ANYTHING introduced recently, which didn't have bugs in it? 2v2 Dojo, Dino Fight, new content... Not ot mention that always when something is revealed to us it is partly in French. I'm just saying MT should treat us with a little respect. I don't say it is Epoq's fault (maybe axcept not responding for PMs), he is doing great job and trying hard, we all can see that.

                <cite>Do you remember ANYTHING introduced recently, which didn't have bugs in it? 2v2 Dojo, Dino Fight, new content</cite><br>There is no software without bugs. This is the first thing you learn in software development.<br><br>Well, to my knowledge Mahmuti quest had no major bugs reported. Neither had celestial island, nor monster island.<br><br>The dojo had a bug that caused a reset. I was really pissed off about it (stopped playing one of their other games as a sign of protest, and will most likely not buy christmas tickets neither this year). But it wasn't the first time this happened, it was the second. Were you complaining when that happened last year? Why is it a low point now and not then?<br><br>If anything, my main complain at this moment is that they gave us too much to do. I was almost done with the content the game was offering, now I have a lot of things i haven't done yet again. This puts me at a bigger disadvantage towards paying people, as it is much easier for them to finish everything (and gain the bonuses involved).

                Get some initiative, don't wait for something to pop-up and say that isn't in your tastes after that. Like the goblins event, on FR server it's a player initiative, only helped by admins for NPCs (and rewards). Did you ever have done that? I guess no, coz you're satisfied in waiting and be surprised or disgusted.<br><br>I'm not a paying player, but I can still keep up with the updates. Some are flawed, some are not. But it's all about fun, not about the right to direct the game structure. Frankly when you pay for ingame gold or notes, you get what you desired, gold or notes. There's no bug there, the so-called paid services stop here.

                I am thrilled, not disappointed. B4 I started Dinorpg, I played its predecesor Dinoparc, that game was just a trial for this one. It too had many faults, however it just shows how difficult it is to get the idea, program it, and let the public use it.<br><br>Without letting us use it as is, the programmers would sit on the change for maybe months, years and maybe never to be seen by the players.<br><br>I really have seened this game move along in a positive way.

                Piemaster is somewhat right: there will always be complaints.<br>And B1onic is right: there will always be bugs.<br><br>I think Epoq has too much work to do, especially now with Twinoid integration (it seemed like a major work hour drainer for the german admin, but mby that's also because he had to translate some muxxu games). Still he manages to launch actions like the Halloween Contest, the community chat etc. and imo those positive points make it easier to forget about some flaws that occur here and there.<br><br>Contentwise we can't complain. The biggest issue I currently see for DRPG is to establish a good balance, especially in respect to Lvl60. DinoRPG has never been a top-competitive game, but it would be nice if we could at least see some variation and mby interesting new viable builds.

                Epoq, I felt that you weren't going to reply at all, that is why I made the decision to post it here. And after waiting since July 8th - you did. If your intentions were never to reply, then why send an apology and continue to lead me on in chats? Well, that is reason enough to expect a reply. I think you have somehow tried to make the situation look unfavorable toward me because of posting the details of the message. Something I didn't do. I even mentioned in chat to just, "could you reply to my support mail - I don't think it should be brought up in chat"<br><br>I guess IP evidence &amp; such does not prove to be IP evidence if coming from me, however, I am glad that you finally answered me. <br><br>As far as Kiva, I figured by the way I read it and my limited understandings of business, MT would have had a meeting within the past couple months. My assumption was wrong, my apologies for that.

                I'm not a big spender by any means, but personally I am really enjoying the game at the moment, and I think all the new content has given the game a big boost. <br><br>The main thing for me, is that the community numbers continue to grow. When you log on and there are only around 200 online at a time, and when the forum is relatively inactive, you get the feeling that the game is not thriving as much as it deserves. <br><br>However, the newbie boosts and DinoFight were definitely a step in the right direction. Just hope to be able to draw in more players. Probably one thing putting people off is the cost; too expensive imo, especially if you want to participate in wars, etc.<br><br>I love all the new content as well. Really adds to the game. The only thing I feel is really missing, is if the game were a bit more balanced so that there are more variety of strong builds. But it seems that they're working on that.<br><br>Anyway, I should say that I'm not a gamer, and this is the only game that I've paid anything for recently (except for Angry Birds and the like!). I've only played one other mmorpg (Ogame), but this one has really drawn me in. I love the graphics and the rate of play. The only thing holding me back from spending more, is that the numbers of players doesn't seem to be growing, so I don't want it to be a wasted investment.

                I also think that this is the best time so far in dinorpg. There are decisions I don't like as much, but that's all right, never can make everyone happy.<br><br>Also glad to see that epoq pulls through with things. I think back in the day a new war would have been started, if it works or not. And if it doesn't well sucks if you are a player. Postponing an event, even if it won't make you popular, to give everyone the best possible experience in the long run, that's the kind of guy I want in charge.

                I think it is obvious that Epoq is really trying hard to make our user experiences as good as possible with the EN server. As others have noted, things like the Halloween Contest, and the war video contest, and advocating for us to bring us more content quicker have really made the game more fun and give more of a community feel for the game.<br><br>However, in his zeal and excitement to bring us new stuff, sometimes not all the "i"s are dotted and the "t"s crossed. This leads to hiccups and false starts which can be frustrating for the players (think dojo players who won and then lost after the reset). I think the issue is not in effort but in execution and implementation. At times like this communication is most important. Sometimes the communication has been good and at other times we are left wondering and waiting. Things go wrong when rolling new stuff out. I get that and I can accept that, but just please don't leave us in the dark when it does. Let us know what is happening, even if you don't have concrete information, telling us even that is better than nothing at all.

There has been a couple of attempts to strengthen the community and also several attempts to push out good suggestions, but overall it has not been a success.<br><br>Main issue is that there is only a handful of players who are venting their thoughts and bring up things that could be improved, while the majority are hanging in the background and is cheering for the game and says that the only important thing is to have fun.<br><br>So as long as the majority are shooting those who try to make changes in the leg there will be no changes what so ever. As long as MT knows that the community is weak and that only a few is fighting for "justice" then they dont need to care. The change will only come when the bigger masses start to make their voices heard, only then will MT understand that its thanks to the community that their paychecks are not bouncing when they try to go to the bank <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/chart.gif">

                Strange things may occurs, thanks to Roblnhood initiative, Epoq is doing IRC session with us. Thanks to other people initiative, we got other sort of contest (and the halloween epic item is really unique to ENG server).<br><br>So stay there, don't take initiative and please don't complain about nothing is happening from our community side.

                you dont even know what a "majority" is, dinorpg-wise, neither do i. WeÂ´ve seen that recently in the dojo x vs x polls. <br>We need to stop thinking that our opinion has a higher importance just because we voice it and post here. As long as theres not everybody posting here, we cant judge anything. <br>Imho, epoq has been too soft already... he reached us his hand, we grabbed his whole arm. HeÂ´s been listening MULTIPLE times to our feedback, but now people think that every idea has to be implemented, every voice has to be heard, every complaint has to be satisfied. Thats just NOT how it works. We are one of multiple servers, MT is a company that has the last word of wich direction is beeing choosen for the developement, thats it.<br>I think pie is right, we just have to continue taking initiative, and eventuelly, one or two things will not be unheard. Thats all we can ask for, we cant change the whole game just because 1,5, or 100 players out of multiple thousands dont agree with certain decisions. Complaining about beeing unheard and continuing to try helping this game develope, are 2 different things.

                The good, the bad and the ugly... Its all here in the En.DinoRPG. Come one come all for compliments, complaints, whining and applauds of gratitude. You will surely find it all here <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>Personally, my experience has been bitter sweet. everything from losing my main account that I spent money on, to never getting replies to PMs sent. From spending money and getting quick replies to almost quitting, but instead vowing to never spend another cent on the game so I can stay active. Don't forget not receiving event rewards, then getting it taken care of only 2 months later. there were roll backs during clan events and sad apologies once they were corrected with a lame bonus that didnt cover even half the <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif"> wasted nor <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_xp.gif"> lost.<br><br>In the long run, My opinion is that everyone will never EVER be 100% happy. I am happy with 85% of all that the EN server has o offer. My expectations aren't that high for 2 reasons:<br>1 - I'm no longer a paying member.<br>2 - I'm not also on french server like so many people that are complaining about us not having the content that they already have.<br><br>Simply put... either play there and be happy to work out the majority of the bugs for us here n the EN server and stop complaining OR play here and deal with fewer bugs and minor translation issues from time to time. All in All, many of the people that complain about how much more the French server has over the EN server: pick one and stick to it Or stop complaining and continue to use the advantage you have of knowing what is next here on EN server and continue to take advantage of having knowledge many of us do not have or care to join several servers to get.<br><br>Two things keep me playing:<br>1 - Axie Force<br>2 - McCafeClanCrew<br>The members of both clans are awesome and I'm happy with clan events that go along with the things that can be done while waiting for the next clan event.<br><br>if you read all this: here's your scooby <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_1.gif">snack<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/elem_1.gif"><br> now go find something to do <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"><br><br>Thanks Epoq for all your hard work.

                Just read through all the comments and its pretty different to what i was reading a couple of weeks ago on a similar subject, as to be honest i think the game and support has got better. I mean in the last year we have had invocations, two monster hunts , the dojo, bonfire event, halloween contests, Nimbao, a Clan war, dinofight, a cotc, a 4th of july event, an Easter event, monster island, birthday event and a paper toy contest. Its a lot compared to the days with phantom and biwig, as really it was only a few major events a year. However no mmorpg is perfect and what would you rather have, a game with the best customer support that goes under in a year after it is abandonded(eg formulwan) or game that continues  to run with a limited amount of moderation, and is still competitive (eg dinoparc).  I mean alot of what your saying is true but really the game is running pretty good compared to others

                I'm fairly satisfied with this game. There are definitely better-supported games on the web but this has nothing to do with a lacking Epoq brings to the table (although he could use help). One of the best courses of action MT could take at this point would be to give Epoq an attractive assistant. Otherwise I feel like the poor guy will burn himself out.

                <cite>Plenty of people have tried to take initiative and it led to nothing. Take for instance Nyphanilith's (spelling?) attempt to figure out a community concensus on magic item prices for the EN server... it was summarily ignored and we got the FR prices as hand me downs.</cite><br>Plenty of People = Loam and Nypha.  <br>Maybe another person or two, but I might have forgotten. Ignored suggestions like certain game interfaces don't count, as most MMORPGs ignore those anyway.

                If i was really unhappy i wouldn't be playing still.<br><br>Content wise this last year has been great for the English server. Yes there will be bugs and it does take MT a little longer then most to fix them. But all games will have bugs of some sort or another<br><br>Community wise things have always been about the same. Both complaints abound and Fanbois who will be there to defend. But with Epoq things have def got a lot better in replies from our Admin and such. He really has tried to be helpful and that's really hard seeing MT doesn't want to hire a reasonable amount of help that can cover things better. So they force a whole bunch on very few, which I'm sure is super stressful.<br><br>Now this is where i'll get to my complaint about MT/DinoRPG....MONEY! The gold in this game cost way too much. I'm sorry if you don't think so, then you have too much money i would say. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"> But when the English server come out and i finally jumped over so i wasn't having to translate all the time, i spent a few hundred Euro on trying to keep up with every one and it was fun and i enjoyed being on the top page of ranked players for a while...but then i noticed i was spending a ton just to maintain my position and stuff. So i decided i should stop and try playing for free. It's been fun still have i have really fallen behind, but i do every once in a while spend a tiny bit during an event like the snowplough. BUT if MT was to drop the prices down, i bet a lot more people my be enticed to spend some real cash on the game. This could actually be a good thing for MT as it can be more profitable for a company to lower prices on a product to try and pull in more potential customers. 100 people buying something for $15 is good, but 200 people buying something at $10 is even better. Esp when the item for sale is just some digital code/pictures to use up in a web based game. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"> Nothing physical.

I did have multi accounts for myself back then but the rules say per player and not per computer<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"> I am also afraid of having my accont (richiedude) erased because my computer keeps telling me that there is another computer with the same ip address as mine <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"> and gold does cost way to much<img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/sad.gif"> I have no multiaccounts now they have been erased
