                <p>So as I understood the next Cotc will be the 9th one for us, not the 10th like announced. The one writing those new posts should really get someone to proofread for him (and with that I do not mean the 9/10th thing).</p><p>Anyway, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.dinorpg.com/clan/battleRewards">prizes</a> were announced and they look close to what we had last time. Let me share my thoughts with you about what they might mean for the individual leagues.</p><br><p>ELITE:<br>Nice prizes, 2-4 Napos, a maha egg and the life stealer item for all clans that reach the final round of the last 8. This is pretty much guaranteed, as we saw in last cotc that even with 6 clans there was a quarter final in the starter league (though mismatched to place 1st and 2nd against each other in the semi final). The prizes for 1/8th and 1/16th final round don't matter as we will not see them anyway. Even if 16 clans would register I'm quite sure only the top 8 would be rewarded as there would be 2 pools with only the best 4 of those advancing. The 1/8th and 1/16th prizes are likely more tailored to the FR server as there are more clans competing in each league. How many clans need to register to actually get a final round of last 16 MT again does not tell us. Maybe players familiar with the french clan events are able to enlighten us regarding that point.</p><p>So my advice to clans thinking about registering for elite: Only do that if you think you have a real chance to get into the top 8! If you know you will end up in 9-12th place or even lower only register if you are out for pure fun and don't mind being the punching bag for the others without getting anything back for your enrolement of 50000.</p><br><p>PRO:<br>Prizes for the 2 finalists are nice, 2 Napos, a wasp egg, the life stealer item and not to forget the 100 notes that are especially appealing to the non payers of medium ranked clans. This is almost as good as the prizes for 5-8 in elite and there will be hard fighting for it. For those on place 3-8 the prizes are not attractive: 20/50 notes, a tofufu (that often is offered at min cost on the market) and maybe a napo if you reach the semi final. Like in elite league it is 99% sure we will have only 8 teams in the final rounds, maybe less (with bye mechanics).</p><p>Advice for clans thinking about registering for pro league: to reach the final and get the life stealer you will need to show very good activity and have dinos optimized for level 50. If you don't think you can reach top 2 of this league consider to dive into starter league to take a shot at the life stealer there. The prize for winning starter is better than reaching semi final in pro.</p><br><p>STARTER:<br>Bad, bad, bad decision from MT here, if you ask me.</p><p>Naturally prizes for the starter league are low, but this time the prize for semi finals here is better than for quarter finals in pro, and the winner prize even trumps the semi final prize of pro. I know some people asked for better prizes for starter league after last cotc here, and surely the same happened on the french server, but people should be careful what they wish for. <br>While having nice fights in the preceding cotc the clans that did starter last time now may be comfronted with clans that dive down one league to get the life stealer! Clans that have access to better items (steppes, monster island, nimbao), clans that have more magic items to play with, clans that may have more routine in about everything from battle planning to point running, area defense or intercepting.<br>With multiple turns per day for low level dinos and 2 XP boosts already its not that hard to power level dinos to level 30 or close especially for cotc (expecting to see a lot of sirains in this league).</p><p>Well you got what you asked for.</p><p>Not sure what advice to give. Maybe for some to try pro league to fill those open spaces left by the divers?</p>

For paying players napos are usually worth more than notes (and can actually be 'bought' in a monster hunt, though not unlimited). <br>For some players that are non-payers actually notes are sometimes more important, as they often need to buy some things on the market and cannot use the event income of a top clan for that.<br>Also the 'worth' of Napos has a bit diminished by the monthly dojo, but that I consider a good thing, as it seems to at least partially close the gap between top and other clans napo wise.</p>

I mean, will there be new magic items? Will it be too complex and risky for MT to do a 2nd napo refund, so they can re-arrange the magic item prices? Sure, they've removed the magic item inventory limit, but that only delays the inevitable decline in the value of the napo.</p><p>Whereas with <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_tix.gif" alt=":drpg_bon:" class="tid_ico">, you can do a whole lot more. You can buy spheres, dinoz, ingredients, anything from the tamermarket. It's as flexible as real currency in a way. If you have nothing to buy, you can transfer them into <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/s_gold.gif" alt=":drpg_gold:" class="tid_ico">. For really advanced players, it's probably no difference.</p><p>The prizes should shift the higher napo prizes to lower leagues, where newer players have a good chance of getting them, while in elite league, the prizes should be arranged according to vast amounts of <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/small_tix.gif" alt=":drpg_bon:" class="tid_ico">. I am certain this would drive a lot of competition in COTC.</p>

                <p>Well Kayin thanks for info.<br>And i really did press this button to check if we were in the Elite ligue(and there was confirmation if i want to press this button - so it was no misclick). And we were in Elite ligue - so after that i did nothing - probably i needed to repress Elite ligue button.<br>Anyway thanks for support and feedback.</p>
