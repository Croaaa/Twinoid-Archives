If you have spent even 5 Euros here, you deserve some security regarding your Account, and some say regarding the future of this game.<br><br>If you have spent over 500 Euros, then surely you must agree. How would you like to wake up one day and log on, only to find that your Account has been reset, all the dinoz you worked so hard on have been eliminated, all the items you have accumulated have vanished from your Inventory, and all the time and money you spent here has been for naught? <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/eek.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/huh.gif"><img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/twisted.gif"><br><br>All those Euros you spend pay the salary's of MT's Staff, which as we all know is at a bare minimum right now, keep MT's Servers running--not only here but also for the other games under the MT umbrella--and allow MT to turn a profit and stay in the Black.<br>In addition, the amount of daily traffic we provide to this site allows it to be ranked and valued at over $700,000 according to several Online Website Analysis Systems.<br><br>In return, we expect more than just a flawed and mediocre PvP system, a flawed and unfair Market/Auction System, an under-staffed Administration that is unable to handle it's workload in a timely manner (through no fault of their own) and perhaps most importantly, we deserve the safety and security of knowing that our accounts will never be 'reset,' 'deleted,' or otherwise altered in any way without our express written consent.<br>We would also like to be more involved in the decisions made which affect us all, and which determine the present and future state of this game.<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><strong><em><u>And now, to wit, this 4th Day of April, 2010 come the Members of the Official DinoRPG Players Union, who demand safety,security,assurance, flexibility, the hiring of more Admins and other qualified Staff, and a more direct role in the daily decisions made about the present and future of this game.<br>Let it be known that any arbitrary deletion of any part of any players Account is wholly and completely unacceptable.<br><br>Let it be known that we want to be informed of plans for the future of this game, in advance, not a day before such changes might occur.<br><br>Let it be known that we demand that Motion Twin LLC hire a proper Staff of Developers, Administrators and moderators, in numbers sufficient to handle the workload to which they are assigned, and with the ability and qualifications to handle said duties.<br><br>Let it be known that we desire a more efficient, fun and fair PvP system, without loop-holes, exploits and cheats, and which includes a broader, more inclusive and more intricate method of Player vs Player Content.<br><br>let it be known that we are unhappy with the present Market-Place/Auction System, and that we would like to see some of the ideas that have been mentioned in previous threads implemented, and we would like the current system to be tweaked to be more fair. Some ideas that are to be considered are a Timer, the removal of the 3-day automatic waiting system, the removal of a minimum price,the ability to sell directly to friends and clan-mates at prices agreed to prior to any actual sale,a SELL NOW option for Masters who wish to accept an offer before the 3-day waiting period ends, and a silent auction-style system.<br>Yes,some of these ideas would allow for multi-account abuse, but security measures could be implemented to help avoid this.<br><br>Let it be known that we demand a guarantee of security of our Accounts,and that such a guarantee should include but not be limited to <br>A. Extra back-up Servers to preserve all data in the event of a virus, system failure or other malicious attempt to manipulate data stored on MT Servers<br>B.

                <cite>All this time and real money, and we have no guarantee, no security whatsoever.<br><br>The LLC Motion Twin could fold tomorrow, and none of us would receive any compensation.<br>MT could reset our accounts tomorrow, a bug or virus could wipe the Servers clean..you get the idea.</cite>This is the same with really any other service that exists today, whether it be subscription based or not. Like any other company M-T has protected itself by means of their <a href="http://support.motion-twin.com/cgu" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a>.<br><cite><u><strong>Article 3 – Access to services</strong></u><br>Motion Twin guarantees the correct functioning of its services except in the case of material faults. By this, Motion Twin refers to technical problems which are not under its control; such as the loss of hardware, blocking by a server or any incident which could damage the data stored in equipment.<br></cite><br><cite>In addition, the amount of daily traffic we provide to this site allows it to be ranked and valued at over $700,000 according to several Online Website Analysis Systems.</cite>This doesn't really make a case for you really. Maybe they make enough money from this game to employ 1 or 2 permanent admins while more content comes to us as the community as a whole is prepared for it and not just when the top paying players are. That figure of $700,000 has no real bearing on the amount of money this site actually makes. Maybe M-T as a whole could claim to be worth $700,000, but I seriously doubt it even makes or has that much worth as an entire company if you were to take into every single property it owns and the revenue it makes annually from them. This site has no ads from which to make traffic from and it really only points to itself so unless you're giving them money, I don't see where they're making their money unless they're selling our information to data miners or something.<br><br><cite>In return, we expect more than just a flawed and mediocre PvP system, a flawed and unfair Market/Auction System, an under-staffed Administration that is unable to handle it's workload in a timely manner (through no fault of their own) and perhaps most importantly, we deserve the safety and security of knowing that our accounts will never be 'reset,' 'deleted,' or otherwise altered in any way without our express written consent.<br>We would also like to be more involved in the decisions made which affect us all, and which determine the present and future state of this game.</cite>You have a lot of concerns, but what you want is just a bit outlandish. Game Design is a choice and a flavor. You might not like what's here and you're right to feel that way if you do, but like any product, you have the choice not to continue to use it. The money you spent was your mistake in this case. Now don't take that the wrong way and think that I'm just attacking you, I'm not. This is how legal works. You didn't have to pay to play this game, but you did because you wanted to. Now you are unhappy and there's really nothing they <strong>have</strong> to do to rectify that. It'd be in their best interest for them to do so probably, but you can't try to force them to.<br><br>Also, as mentioned above in their T&amp;C, sometimes there might be data loss that you can't do anything about. M-T has stated that they will guarantee as much security as they can, but there's nothing they can do if their systems get wiped and all of their back-ups get swallowed up by the earth or something. It's not in their best interest to reset the game and lose a bunch of their community including paying customers and your paranoia seems to exclude that logic.<br><br><cite><strong>FinalCutz's List of Demands</strong><br>*snip</cite>I think you are just taking this too far in the end. It's not that I don't understand your problems, but it's more of a paranoid rant rather than anything that's logical.<br><br>I have spent more than a hundred bucks on this game and still, I wouldn't have paid for it if I did not enjoy this game. What you want requires something different than what you think this game really is. You want full support for a game that doesn't charge you a subscription and you want guarantees that nobody on earth can give you. There's always a chance data can get corrupted or disappear. No company can guarantee this for you without giving you restitution for your loss.<br><br>Sure the game could be better, sure we could have more content and some things that disliked by some of the community could be changed, but at the end of the day we are getting a translation of a game that is still much further ahead of where we are right now. Our Admin has no power in changing content rather they can help us as much as they can to make our experience as enjoyable as possible.<br><br>The most you can really hope for is to ask the Admin(s) if we could have a list of future updates or even just or next update that we can all look forward to (and prepare for, for some of the further along players). It's a bit crazy to think you can have more than just that.

                MT will have copies of everything in their servers so i think we have security with our accounts. what i am worried about is MT thinking that they want to keep making more games and leave this one in the dust. obviously this game produces a lot of profit for them, and they could make more and more servers for newer crowds instead of new content.<br><br>im not exactly signing this petition, but i think that the point of us knowing this will be an ever expanding game is more important than is our account backed-up... which it really must be

                Aye, wel all agreed to those crappy T&amp;C of the game. Yepp i do think they are crappy, but not for the support so much.<br><br>After all the most support i find for this game has been the support of the players, but then again i have never had anything more serious than the flash not working and that i could sort out myself.<br><br>However the one thing i would say that we who chose to pay anyway have a right to get, is the right to actually get heard about suggestions on how to improve the game. The official word from MT is that they won't listen to players suggestion of new things to the game, only in the rare exception that it can improve gameplay in some pretty major ways or the like.<br><br>Now for them to listen and think about new content that is out of the question which is odd seeing as we are still paying freely and all we ask is that they listen and think about it. They get free ideas from us which they can build on and we don't ask anything else in return.<br><br>Any of you feel this is to much to ask? To have a developer be around to actually listen to some of these ideas and if we can use it to evolve the game to the next level. Not asking for anything fast growing here, just something that can help them maybe put up a little more content and maybe just a teeny weeny bit faster than they do right now.

                what i know about Union is,<br>if i work on some company, i get <em>paid</em>.<br>and when i got abused in work, by it physically or mentally, i can get to workers union and sue the company.<br><br><strong>But</strong><br>if i go to some restaurant and im eating there.<br>they might give some free coupont or free cookies.<br>if i want a better food, i have to <em>pay</em>.<br><br>so, if at the 10th come back, i dont like the food, or the taste somehow bland, i can sue them and ask for my 10 times spent money back?<br><br>if i know that i dont like the food, why should i go back to the same restaurant?<br>because i already spent some money there?<br><br>lmao...<br><br><br>1st of all, this is a <strong>Free RPG</strong>.<br>no one force ayone to pay.<br><br>i dont think u can sue something that meant for free rite?<br>anyway, the cost to maintain a world wide game isnt cheap either <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br><br>as for Phrometeus post, i agree.<br><br>rather than making a union, what we really need is some kind of <em>Selected-Players-Committee</em> that can bring some of <strong>Useful Suggestion</strong> to the Devs team.<br><br>i dont think if any Devs roaming in forum will do any good.<br>there will be too many PM and only result on unread message <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>the <em>Selected-Players-Committee</em> can sort out the unuseful suggestion or unreasonable suggestion and only bring the most important one to the Devs team.<br><br>and Devs team or Admins can give some hints on change-on-game to the Committee and the committee can give something like a rumour about it.

                One thing that all unions tend to have in common is that you have to pay membership fees to join them - perhaps someone is just looking to fund his DinoRPG habit.<br><br>There is nothing "official" about this suggested union and I object to the suggestion that there is. It will have no more power than anyone already has.

                The selected-player-committee idea is a good one, as for who is to sit on it. Well i have an idea how that could work too.<br><br>Seeing as we have some moderators on here and they are involved in the game, i am sure they got some ideas who could sit on this committee. It doesn't have to be all paying members either, but more of those that perhaps contribute to the game in a good way, like helps out on the forums when someone has problems, knows a bit on how to deal with problems that might arise or generally has some solid and well supported ideas on how this game can be changed for the better <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif"><br><br>Of course these would also have to be somewhat good at english seeing as they have to understand all our gibberish <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/razz.gif"><br>A positive and polite attitude would also be a good asset <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                The fact that we all agreed to the terms does not mean that we are all happy with them and that we cannot and should not change anything.<br><br>I'm not an expert of law but I think we can at least ask MT to give us some more security. Maybe they will see that we might spent more money if we can be sure that our accounts won't be deleted under any circumstances. For me there is always the law: "Spend only as much as you can affort to completely lose." Still it would be much more enjoyable not lose anything.

                I know people don't like to assume, but many companies, online or not tend to have multiple backups. There are also paid services that allow you to backup your systems whenever you want for a nominal annual fee that's pretty cheap. The fact of the matter is that whether or not they do this, it will probably never be discussed and the information will probably never reach us due to NDAs protecting the company.<br><br>Even with every measure taken, there's still a chance we could lose all of our data and that's just how it is. If you know anything about computers, you know that sometimes crap just happens and there's really nothing you can do about it. It's been a year and for the most part, the game has been good to me at least and I just hope that it continues to.<br><br>I don't know what people expect when they say they want more security. Is this some sort of sugar pill experiment? If M-T came out and openly admitted that they understand our concerns and are searching for further methods of back-up and making sure that our information is safe in the case their main servers get corrupted or wiped somehow? We don't really know how much they invest into backing up the servers or how they do it and M-T has no obligation to tell us and you can't expect that they should have to, no company needs to do that for their customer. Shareholders on the other hand...

                I think Final was just a bit too emotional about things. There's really no reason to quit and even if he does, nothing really comes from it except some sad farewells. I think we should just stop bumping this thread and let it fade away so that people don't bug him about it further.

                Well I'm happy people are at least taking notice.<br><br>I never said I was going to quit..Nyphanalith is perhaps using a bit of persuasive wishful thinking there.<br><br>Yes I know the T and C, yes I spent money of my own accord. So that means I don't have the right to make suggestions, request changes, try to create a safer environment and a channel through which we can appeal to the Developers?<br><br>Siky you miss the point, and Nypha, I really dunno what your trying to say.. except maybe that you'd be happy if I did quit.<br><br>While this may be a 'free' game with no download or subscription costs, the only way to make any progress before your 8o years old is to spend real money.<br>The 700k Site Analysis was just to give players an idea of the value that DinoRPG has in relation to other Websites, and that value is a direct result of not only the free traffic, but also the thousands of Euros many of us have spent here.<br>Many factors go into that analysis.<br><br>Do you really think MT is just barely scraping by? They are making a nice profit,because people like me and many others spend real money here often. <br><br>My 'demands' are really suggestions, aggressively stated. We are not employees, but we have a vested interest in this game and this website, because we spend a great deal of real money here.<br>Nothing I wrote was a result of emotion, but rather a carefully considered philosophy in relation to Companies and Websites that make money from the players/subscribers--be it from download costs, monthly subscription costs or buying coins and notes.<br><br>Just because we don't pay a subscription or DL fee does not mean we don't financially support this Company and, in fact, it is all the real money we spend that allows MT to hire staff, provide content and keep the Servers running.<br><br>Sure you don't have to spend real money to play, but due to the painfully and intentionally slow turn-system, among other things,if you want to compete and make any real progress, you are going to have to pony up.<br><br>Take a look around. Everything from the super-slow turn-system to the Yakuzi Kabu Egg waiting period is intentionally geared to slow your progress. You can only rest to %50 ,you have to wait an entire day to make another move, and healing/Irma potions are the only way around this.<br><br>This is no accident. The reason is two-fold: 1. to encourage you to spend real money and 2. to slow progress not just to make you spend money, but because the developers are either unable or unwilling to expand this game in an acceptable way.<br>If it takes you forever to clear the available content, then they don't have any pressure to provide new content.<br><br>If your happy with being forced to spend money and still not getting the content and communication you deserve, then that is your preogative.<br><br>I however find it unsatisfactory.<br><br>I am not bitter. I play this game because I enjoy it, and I spend money because it's the only way to be competitive. If it was possible to make progress without spending money, then you would have an argument Siky, but it is not. You simply don't have a choice, unless your very very patient and don't mind waiting until your 80 years old to have a decent account.<br><br>So is it really a free game? One could look upon it as actually consisting of two separate games- 1 for the real-money spenders like me, and one for everyone else.<br><br>Check the Top 100 rankings and find me a master that hasn't spent a significant amount of money. Find me a clan that has had any real success without big-spenders among their ranks.<br>In fact, one of the first things leaders and recruiters look for in a player is how deep their pockets are.I have seen it stated directly, and also in a more subtle form.<br><br>A Union by definition is a group of people united for a cause,it doe not have to be a group of employees that work for an employer. In this case, it would be a group of players that desire security for the accounts they worked so hard and so long for, updated content in a reasonable time-frame, and a direct channel for communication with the developers.<br><br>I'm not threatening anyone or asking anyone to pledge allegiance to my flag, nor am I suggesting that anyone threaten to quit should our requests not be met.<br><br>All I'm asking for is that MY consider hireing more Staff so that the existing Staff is not over-worked, that they provide a channel through which we have direct contact with the Developers so that they will take our suggestions seriously, that they don't move on to something new and leave DinoRPG "in the dust,' as someone else put it.<br><br>I am quite satisfied with the progress I have made in the short time I have been playing this game, but I am also not disillusioned that such progress could be made without the use of cold hard cash.<br><br>You don't have to pay to play, but you do have to pay if you want to play with the big boys and girls, and the big boys and girls deserve something in return for all the money we spend--something beyond the bare minimum.<br><br>I would think that many of the people that don't spend real money would also be interested in account security, updated content and dialogue with developers, because they too have  made an investment, in the form of time and effort.<br><br>A Union is not only for the money players, it is for everyone.The money players , however, do have a greater stake in the future of this game.<br><br>Since so many of us do spend real money, MT IS now in a position to make some changes, and that is all I am saying.<br>We allow MT to make a profit, and if they are in a position to give some of that profit back to us in the form of better content, then I think they have a responsibility to do so.<br><br><strong><em>Would it be so hard to add sound effects and music? Maybe some new and more varied Mobs and Dinoz races/classes. Maybe race/class specific buffs and spells that only certain dinoz would have, that could be used on allies and friends to make PvP more enjoyable--like HOTS and DOTS and health buffs and Skill buffs etc etc just like other MMORPG games have.Maybe an improved Market/Auction System--including a cross-server global marketplace--which would allow for more options, better deals and a broader economic  environment.Maybe some new areas besides the Steppes, that could be added more often than once every two years. maybe a new transportation system that would allow players to move around more rapidly, like warps, mounts, portals etc... If a dinoz has FLIGHT, should it not be able to traverse water and move faster?</em></strong><br><br>But nooooooo, that would allow people to make progress WITHOUT spending real money, and we just can't have that now can we...<br>Anything that has the potential to accelerate movement and acquisition of power is automatically  discarded, because it would discourage the use of real money.. or so MT thinks.<br><br><br>In reality, these improvements would, in the long run, bring in even more real money, as players would be having more fun, making more progress and would be able to see the light at the end of a very long and at present dark tunnel that is ultimately a dead-end.<br><br>The ratio of profit to expenditure is greatly distorted, and as long as everyone acts like sheep and just goes along with it, it will stay that way.<br><br>If we band together as a unified group, not to make trouble or cause problems or to try and  bankrupt MT, but rather to encourage the creation of new content, which could include not only new areas,Mobs and dinoz, but also music, sound effects, group buffs/spells and alternative modes of transportation, then maybe the developers and powers that be would be forced take notice, and then take action.<br><br>There is simply no reason not to try. be it a selective-player group, Union, Board of Players--whatever you want to call it--the goal is the same.<br><br>It would not be an elitist group restricted to leaders and moderators and big-money spenders. This Union would be open to anyone and everyone that plays this game, and that would like to encourage the implementation of positive changes and open lines of communication.<br><br>Players like nyphanalith resist this because she is already 'superior' to most everyone else, and would like to keep it that way. leveling the playing field is not in her best interest. I however am unbiased. I am strong, and getting stronger. I do spend real money, and quite a bit of it--and still, i would like to see a more level playing field, and a more enjoyable one.

                You know, most serious online communities or companies trying to develop communities around their products would crap their pants to have so much passion and interest by members as is shown by the DinoRPG community. Almost all would jump at the opportunity to allow members to participate more, knowing that it will breed more loyalty to the product. Conversely, MT at best ignores it and at worst scoffs at it, from what I've seen so far. Of course they don't <strong>have</strong> to do a damn thing, but an opportunistic and smart business would be all over this. <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/smile.gif">

                First of all, I do not work for M-T though I do not see the relevance of that. Aggressive "negotiation" doesn't work the way you might think it does. What kind of aggressive negotiation are you trying to organize? You plan to boycott M-T products or maybe get every paying player to stop spending money in this game? What leverage do you have other than threatening to leave the game?<br><br>Secondly, I haven't really spoken badly of you, rather I've more or less been speaking sympathetically while others have been telling you to just quit if you don't like it. I can only assume you skimmed through my words angrily and decided to rant further. Nowhere in my posts did I even mention for you to quit so you're just blindly accusing me of stuff to continue your <strong>rant</strong>.<br><br>Third, suggestions are ignored probably because there's some update in the future that addresses our current problems or they just don't want to make the change. We haven't really gotten anything different from any other version of the game except for our <em>New Turn timer</em>. All new content we'll have is based on what came before us in the French Server and like I said before, it comes when a certain amount of the community is ready for it, maybe not when the top 50 or top 100 are ready for it. Is this not logical for you? Maybe as a "high roller" in this game you assume that they should just release everything so that paying players can just get further and further ahead of everyone else? Maybe they don't want to do this? You think alienating new players from joining wars or creating new clans to try and compete in wars is a good idea?<br><br>I understand you can be bored, but doing it like this? Look through your thread and find someone who's signed it. Forget being nice since you don't seem to care for niceties. There are <strong>none</strong>. There are ways to get your point across and writing a rant post is not it. How about talking to every person in the top 100, discuss and have a real representative talk to one (only?) admin on this forum and see what options you actually have. I don't know what world you live in, but I don't know any <strong>online</strong> union that's not recognized by anybody that has done anything of major notice ever. It's not the same as Worker's Union.<br><br>Anyways, this post will probably just rile you up some more so I'll just end my point. I don't think you have any idea how to represent yourself or your ideas and that I strongly believe that what you think you're doing is right and the only way to do things. It's a joke and I won't bother to chime in anymore since nobody here seems to fully agree with you enough to even virtually sign this thread and side with you anyways so why try to have a discussion with someone who can't fully read, comprehend and think before writing a reply?

                I have just seen your dinoz. I don't don't think you have  seen all of the steppes either, so why complaining about not enough new content? Also you haven't finished the catacombs ...<br>I'm also missing Brute Force trophys, Underwater Dome trophys, Skully Bone, Venerable trophy on your account. So what's wrong with the amount of content in DinoRPG?

                Without offending anyone, some just can never get enough, some are impatient and some just expect something more than what is provided even though nothing is promised (as that would ruin the experience of seeing what the game has to offer)<br><br>With that said, the only thing that can really be changed on a positive manner without the use of a union, is to get MT to consider making a panel composed of players that have some well rounded experience with the game, has a good attitude and of course good ideas on how to change the game for the better. Said ideas could go to these players from the ones outside the panel so that they can evaluate and sift through stuff for MT to consider themselves. It would be of no cost to MT, advanageous to us players and "fair" for all (fair being a relative term in this context)<br><br>So i again vote, close this thread as it is already moving away from what it was initially opened for.

                You are right on this points Finalcutz (not on the other)<br><br><br>But you probably need to extend that on your clan i think:<br><br>EC, who demand safety,security,assurance, flexibility, the hiring of more Admins and other qualified Staff, and a more direct role in the daily decisions made about the present and future of this game. To let English connection win against their allies, to avoid strong clan like DC being so strong!!!! To avoid member like Plib do the same strategy of ten of your member (Dinorama, Over2, Ziriel, Wikid...)  in some Clan (Dinotopia, Niasa...), to avoid that strong player quit EC but let them join EC...<br><br>Safety,security,assurance, flexibility for EC to win all the wars, it's unfair if it's not the case <img src="http://en.dinorpg.com/img/forum/smiley/confused.gif"> The best clan in the world!!!! With no liers and no master who manipulates people... Long life to an unbrackable clan, and to you Finalcutz!!!!

                I propose that we form a players union, to discuss issues, suggest changes and to ask for help. It would be open to the first 500,000 people who are interested. We will have a forum that we can use for the discussion, with some members who can moderate the forum. We can expect the MT representatives to watch the forum, and comment as they see the need.<br><br>Wait! We already have that! Why would anyone think we are better off with a small elite crowd when we can all take part?

                in all reality we have been progressing in our needs as the english server. im not sure if any other server has 2 admins working on it. obviously it has been an improvement, just because MT doesnt openly say (anything) doesnt mean there isnt progress coming our way. i am happy with what we've got, a great game and an ever growing population of players.
