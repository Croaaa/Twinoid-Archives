                <p>Minitroopers has recently made a number of people very angry, including me. However, as anger serves no function in a successful rebuttal, I will simply state objectively that Minitroopers's hastily mounted campaigns are all too often clad in the mischievous garb of antinomianism. Perhaps before going on, I should describe Minitroopers to you. Minitroopers is snooty, puzzleheaded, and unruly. Furthermore, it yearns to encourage the acceptance of scapegoating and demonization. Minitroopers always tries to rationalize its soliloquies with compelling gobbledegook about some "greater good". So what's the connection between that and Minitroopers's views? The connection is that all the deals it makes are strictly one-way. Minitroopers gets all the rights, and the other party gets all the obligations.</p><p>As for the lies and exaggerations, Minitroopers has a natural talent for complaining. It can find any aspect of life and whine about it for hours upon hours. If Fate desired that Minitroopers make a correct application of what it had read about quislingism it would have to indicate title and page number since the petulant, linguacious loblolly would otherwise never in all its existence find the correct place. But since Fate does not do this, there'll always be some uncivilized grammaticaster who's eager to complain about my use of English in this letter. He'll probably tell me that it's grammatically incorrect to use the word "picayunish" when writing, "Minitroopers is a picayunish lamebrain." Well, the fact is that Minitroopers is a picayunish lamebrain, and I can defend each and every point I've made so far. For the benefit of any doubting Thomases I will prove that point via an explanation of how Minitroopers is entirely mistaken if it believes that it does the things it does "for the children".</p><p>I once pointed out to Minitroopers that out of all of the anti-democratic, pushy scammers I've ever known, it is clearly the most callow. All I could garner from its ensuing mussitation was some nonsense about how anyone who disagrees with it is a potential terrorist. It's this sort of stinking response that leads me to believe that Minitroopers insists that its jibes are a breath of fresh air amid our modern culture's toxic cloud of chaos. Although I've already discussed the abject fallaciousness of that argument, the fact remains that in this world, there are fatuous, infernal smart alecks. There are splenetic, misinformed backbiters. There are rats who walk like men. And then there is Minitroopers. Of those, I avouch that Minitroopers is the most nugatory because its cronies are unified under a common goal. That goal is to render unspeakable and unthinkable whole categories of beliefs about power. We must stand united against the forces of intolerance, against the forces of violence, and against the forces of warlordism. Never forget that and never let Minitroopers blend together absolutism and statism in a train wreck of monumental proportions.</p>

I read the first paragraph and immediately got confused. What are you talking about?</cite><p>If you're confused by Minitroopers's mind games then I'll simplify it for you. First, Minitroopers's utterances stink to high heaven. Minitroopers thinks that it's above everyone else. Of course, thinking so doesn't make it so. In closing, it hardly need be said that the views expressed above are tentative and suggestive. You should now go off and perform a thorough study of your own. Of course, this will be an exercise in futility unless you accept the fundamental premise of this complaint, namely that Minitroopers has a deficiency of real goals.</p><p>I want to share some facts with you. These are hidden truths that affect us all. First things first: A central point of Minitroopers's belief systems is the notion that skin color means more than skill, and gender is more impressive than genius. Perhaps it should take some new data into account and revisit that notion. I think it'd find that whenever it attempts to do everything possible to keep scary sluggards crime-stained and hidebound, it looks around waiting for applause as if it's done something decent and moral rather than directionless and mingy. My purpose is to think outside the box. Most of the battles I fight along the way are exigencies, not long-range educational activities. Nevertheless, if Fate desired that Minitroopers make a correct application of what it had read about interventionism it would have to indicate title and page number since the apolaustic, bloody-minded fanatic would otherwise never in all its existence find the correct place. But since Fate does not do this, I believe I have found my calling. My calling is to ensure that we survive and emerge triumphant out of the coming chaos and destruction. And just let it try and stop me. Because Minitroopers is so caught up in trying to taunt, deride, and generally vilipend its rivals, I'd like to conclude this letter by quoting to it the last line of R. M. Rilke's poem, "Archaic Torso of Apollo": "You must change your life."</p>

That's a reasonable term to use, I insist, but let's now try to understand it a little better. For starters, it has repeatedly indicated a desire to teach the next generation how to hate—and whom to hate. Is that the sound of rarefied respectability that Minitroopers's cringers so frequently attribute to Minitroopers? The malignant blathering of a prurient, ugly duffer is more like it. In fact, what I have been writing up to this point is not what I initially intended to write in this letter. Instead, I decided it would be far more productive to tell you that it is not uncommon for Minitroopers to victimize the innocent, penalize the victim for making any effort to defend himself, and then paint the whole stolid affair as some great benefit to humanity.</p>

                <p>Funny how There IS an argument generator i just found searching on google.lemme post my argument:</p><p>Jonas1's fulminations are utterly disgusting—so much so, that if there are any children or sensitive people reading this letter, I suggest that they stop now and not read what I am about to describe. Before I start, however, I should state that to understand what Jonas1's particularly drugged-out form of tammanyism has encompassed as a movement and as a system of rule, we have to look at its historical context and development as a form of disingenuous politics that first arose in early twentieth-century Europe in response to rapid social upheaval, the devastation of World War I, and the Bolshevik Revolution. More concretely, I overheard one of Jonas1's goombahs say, "Jonas1 can change its irascible ways." This quotation demonstrates the power of language as it epitomizes the "us/them" dichotomy within hegemonic discourse. As for me, I prefer to use language to shield people from Jonas1's tetchy and sullen deceptions.</p><p>Given the tenor of our times, Jonas1 holds onto power like the eunuch mandarins of the Forbidden City—sterile obstacles to progress who create a beachhead for organized absenteeism. I am shocked and angered by Jonas1's disgraceful improprieties. Such shameful conduct should never be repeated. Jonas1 may inure us to furciferous antagonism right after it reads this letter. Let it. By the next full moon, I will point out that the emperor has no clothes on. Jonas1 predicted long ago that it'd go straight to Heaven after it dies. I see a different, warmer eternity for it, especially when you consider that it has been known to "prove" statistically that everyone and everything discriminates against it—including the writing on the bathroom stalls. As you might have suspected, its proof is flawed. The primary problem with it is that it replaces a legitimate claim of association with an illegitimate claim of causality. Consequently, Jonas1's "proof" demonstrates only that its squadristi believe that national-security interests can and should be sidestepped whenever its institutional interests are at stake. It should not be surprising that they believe this, however. As we all know, minds that have been so maimed that they believe that the world's salvation comes from whims, irrationality, and delusions can believe anything, especially if it's false.</p><p>I won't lie to you; Jonas1's obstinate bromides are in full flower, and their poisonous petals of triumphalism are blooming all around us. My fantasy is to immerse myself in the grandeur and greatness of the pre-Jonas1 world, a world in which it was unfathomable that anyone could desire to fuel the censorship-and-intolerance crowd. As you've no doubt gathered, realizing such a fantasy requires addressing the legitimate anger, fear, and alienation of people who have been mobilized by Jonas1 because they saw no other options for change. If you can make any sense out Jonas1's spineless principles then you must have gotten higher marks in school than I did.</p><p>Jonas1 once had the audacity to tell me that it is patriotic to construct the spectre of a terrible armed threat. My riposte was that it twists every argument into some sort of "struggle" between two parties. Jonas1 unvaryingly constitutes the underdog party, which is what it claims gives it the right to pose a threat to personal autonomy and social development. The worst classes of contemptible stuffed shirts I've ever seen are born, not made. That dictum is as unimpeachable as the "poeta nascitur, non fit" that it echoes and as irreproachable as the brocard that Jonas1 motivates people to join its terrorist organization by using words like "humanity", "compassion", and "unity". This is a great deception. What Jonas1 really wants to do is create a factitious demand for its unambitious slurs. That's why Jonas1 uses big words like "phenomenalistic" to make itself sound important. For that matter, benevolent Nature has equipped another puny creature, the skunk, with a means of making itself seem important, too. Although Jonas1's activities may reek like a skunk, psychotic Bourbonism and Jonas1's surmises are one and the same. That said, let me continue.</p><p>To have the audacity to say that "amoral adolescents"—and let's be clear that Jonas1 is referring here to its opponents—are incabable of making technical preparations for the achievement of freedom and human independence is, in my opinion, nothing short of insincere. Jonas1 is a stiff-necked, predaceous loblolly. I use that label only when it's true. If you don't believe it is, then consider that I think I know why Jonas1 is so intent on transforming our little community into a global crucible of terror and gore. Jonas1 uses such behavior as a hollow, saccharine palliative for a soul wrenched by serious internal contradictions. This explains why if we don't soon tell it to stop what it's doing, it will proceed with its cocky prophecies, considerably emboldened by our lack of resistance. We will have tacitly given it our permission to do so. The bottom line is that insane defeatism is merely a symptom of the disease called "Jonas1-ism".</p><br><p>dunno if its the one he is using.</p>

All kidding aside, I don't know what makes Minitroopers think that divine ichor flows through its veins. Maybe it's been sipping cuckoo juice. The fact of the matter is that Minitroopers is the embodiment of everything petty in our lives. Every grievance, every envy, every gormless ideology finds expression in Minitroopers. I am sick of hearing Minitroopers intone with an authority reminiscent of Moses descending Sinai that cocky lobcocks are all inherently good, sensitive, creative, and inoffensive. That being the case, we can infer that it might operate in the gray area between legitimate activity and slovenly diabolism faster than you can say "roentgenographically". What are we to do then? Place blinders over our eyes and hope we don't see the horrible outcome? The moral of the story: I disagree both with Minitroopers's point and with the way it makes it.</p>

How many people have goodness in the heart in our days? We all doesn't have not a little of notion of the reality of other people, other countries, other cultures! We just know our town's reality, maybe of our country. We are bound with our little existence. We just don't care if anyone is dying, hungry, tired, sad... We just want money and comfort.

                <p>Ok, maybe I should not say what is right and what is wrong when it comes to Minitroopers's philosophies. But I will say one thing: Minitroopers parrots whatever ideas are fashionable at the moment. When the fashions change, its ideas will change instantly like a weathercock. It's easy for us to shake our heads at Minitroopers's foolishness and cowardice. It's easy for us to exclaim that we should listen to others. It's easy for us to say, "I am highly critical of those who tolerate or apologize for people who work with Minitroopers." The point is that it's easy for us to say these things because Minitroopers's obiter dicta will have consequences—very serious consequences. We ought to begin doing something about that. We ought to champion the poor and oppressed against the evil of Minitroopers. We ought to spread the word that it has declared that it's staging a revolt against everyone who dares to get the facts out in the hope that somebody will do something to solve the problem. Minitroopers is revolting all right; the very sight of it turns my stomach. All kidding aside, it is absolutely uncouth, as it has proved to my complete satisfaction.</p><p>Minitroopers is an indefatigable spokesman for pharisaism. That proves that on this subject we get only a lot of blather and obfuscation from Minitroopers and its votaries. To top that off, griping about Minitroopers will not make it stop trying to combine, in a rare mixture, bestial cruelty and an inconceivable gift for lying. But even if it did, it would just find some other way to form the association in the public's mind between any homilies it disagrees with and the ideas of hate and violence and illegality. When it comes to Minitroopers's initiatives, I suspect that we have drifted along for too long in a state of blissful denial and outright complacency. It's time to help you reflect and reexamine your views on it. The sooner we do that the better because I admit that I'm not perfect. I admit that I may have been a bit patronizing when I stated that Minitroopers should stop lying about how it is a spokesman for God. Still, that doesn't justify its obstinate, rudimentary fatuousness that it invariably finds so necessary. Nor does it justify Minitroopers's displaying an irreconcilable hatred toward all nations.</p>

                <p>While there are probably a lot of people out there who would be quite content never to read another letter about Jonas1, Jonas1 serves as a conduit that carries the élan vital of statism. You see, I clearly believe that by showing a clear lack of respect not just for those brave souls who fought and died for what they believed in but also for you, the readers of this letter, Jonas1 has forfeited its claim to be morally superior to Attila's Huns or Hulagu's Mongols. And because of that belief, I'm going to throw politeness and inoffensiveness to the winds. In this letter, I'm going to be as rude and crude as I know how, to reinforce the point that Jonas1 gets particularly concerned whenever someone indicates that posterity will have little occasion to glorify its "heroic" existence in a new epic. It should realize, however, that such negative opinions of it simply come with the territory. Rather than try to suppress the unflattering things people say about it, Jonas1 would do well to consider that I'm not a fatuous person. I'd like nothing more than to extend my hand in friendship to Jonas1's helpmeets and convey my hope that in the days to come we can work together to find more constructive contexts in which to work toward resolving conflicts. Unfortunately, knowing them, they'd rather create a Frankenstein's monster because that's what Jonas1 wants.</p><p>I receive a great deal of correspondence from people all over the world. One of the things that impresses me about all of it is the massive number of people who realize that Jonas1 wants to exploit the feelings of charity and guilt that many people have over the plight of the homeless. Alas, that's a mere ripple on the snotty ocean of nonrepresentationalism in which Jonas1 will drown any attempt to protect the interests of the general public against the greed and unreason of debauched schlubs. Someone needs to pull back the curtains on Jonas1's campaigns of malice and malignity and show them for what they really are. Who's going to do it? Jonas1? I think not. When one examines the ramifications of letting Jonas1 turn the world's most civilized societies into pestholes of death, disease, and horror, one finds a preponderance of evidence leading to the conclusion that its gofers say, "Education and open-mindedness are some kind of liability." Yes, I'm afraid they really do talk like that. It's the only way for them to conceal that a clever liar can use the truth to tell a monstrous lie. Sad, but true. And it'll only get worse if Jonas1 finds a way to usher in the beginning of a niddering new era of Jacobinism.</p><p>While Jonas1 insists that it has mystical powers of divination and prophecy, reality dictates otherwise. Actually, if you want a real dose of reality, look at how it's astonishing that Jonas1 has been able for so long to get away with pitting the haves against the have-nots. I can't think of anything that better illustrates the failure of our justice system to deal with such quarrelsome fugitives. The space remaining in this letter will not suffice even to enumerate the ways in which Jonas1 has tried to foment disagreeable forms of political tyranny. Jonas1 is extraordinarily brazen. We've all known that for a long time. However, its willingness to palm off our present situation as the compelling ground for worldwide classism sets a new world record for brazenness. Jonas1's disciples form a brazen organization devoted to harassment and barratry, but what makes matters utterly intolerable is knowing that Jonas1 proclaims at every opportunity that it'd never suck up to the worst sorts of choleric pissants there are. The organization doth protest too much, methinks. The last point I'll make is this: The encroachment of quisquilious, filthy warnings into the social fabric of our politics, our institutions, and our laws would give credence to my claim that Jonas1 is the hands-down, flat-out, bar-none most audacious scamp I have ever seen.</p>
