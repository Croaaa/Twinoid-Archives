                <p>Okay, so I've been thinking about making this thread, and I'm finally doing it.</p><p>I understand that perhaps making a whole new thread for this is not necessary, but it's not a choice of what to take, and not a question or two, but plenty.</p><p>I've been thinking of doing a major overview of my main army, Dawnblade. As it is right now, it's not too bad, but it feels like it can be more than that.</p><p>So, without any more pauses, here's the trooper, in order they deploy, what I expect him to do, what I want to get him and a few questions.</p><br><br><p><a href="http://i48.tinypic.com/1040snc.png" target="_blank">http://i48.tinypic.com/1040snc.png</a></p><br><br><p>Orlaley Jr is pretty much my main shock trooper. Packing a double-barreled shotgun, explosive and toxic shells and sprinter, he's able to quickly run up to an enemy group and blast them for a heavy amount of damage. The glue grenade helps not get murdered before that, and interception helps to soften up the enemy before hand.</p><p>I'd like to get him some survivability-enhancing abilities, like camouflage or tuck 'n' roll, for as it is right now, he tends to die way too quickly. Some initiative boosters would be a major boon to him as well.</p><p>2 questions about Orlaley:<br>1) If I have a chance of getting him another weapon, should I take him, or should I just stick with the double-barreled which he has right now?<br>2) If I get offered a piece of equipment, would it be better switching out the glue grenade or the toxic shells if I found that what I got is better than what I have.</p><br><br><p><a href="http://i45.tinypic.com/16kw47a.png" target="_blank">http://i45.tinypic.com/16kw47a.png</a></p><br><br><p>Kevo is my one and only doctor, as well as my newest addition to the army. I expect him to do 2 things:</p><p>1) Use sprinter to heal up allies<br>2) Use Frenetic, Gatling Gun and Eye of the tiger to slaughter enemies.</p><p>The one ability I'd like to get him above all is Battle-Ready, for ammo shortages are the main problem as it is right now. Some doctor-only abilities (Anatomy, saviour, amphetamine shot) would be nice bonuses as well.</p><p>I don't really have a question associating with him.</p><br><br><p><a href="http://i50.tinypic.com/9awfok.png" target="_blank">http://i50.tinypic.com/9awfok.png</a></p><br><br><p>Hulkey is my lone munitions and one of my two anti-spy troopers. He's only got an assault rifle and a knife for a weapon, but he's got some good weapon-enhancing skills. Unforgoving, barrel extension, covering fire and laser sights all work well in unison to, if anything, make his lone weapon actually something dangerous. I leveled him to level 11 to try and get him a weapon, but, alas, Crybaby and Bulletproof vest were the choices of the day. In hindsight, perhaps the vest would have been better because he tends to be my first casualty.</p><p>What I want from him? I think it's obvious: Another weapon. Either to protect from sabotage or to enhance his firepower, I really need something else than the basic assault rifle.</p><p>One question about him:</p><p>If I expect to have to deal with spies, should I equip him with the knife before going in, or should I have him stay with the assault rifle?</p><br><br><p><a href="http://i47.tinypic.com/208z2w5.png" target="_blank">http://i47.tinypic.com/208z2w5.png</a></p><br><br><p>Mooll is my main anti-tank in both senses of the word: Anti-high health enemy trooper and anti-vehicle. The twinoid helps with getting the infernal tube shot out, or, if used after, to get into position to use the M16. Unforgiving and Hydroshock shells help with that.</p><p>I really need to get him something that enhances his health. All he has is the lucky charm which doesn't help too much, though it does protect from killshots.</p><p>1 question:<br>Should I use the loader or the lucky charm? The loader would be a major boon for the M16, but I find the lucky charm's added survivability something I can't ignore.</p><br><br><p><a href="http://i49.tinypic.com/2agjgad.png" target="_blank">http://i49.tinypic.com/2agjgad.png</a></p><br><br><p>Ederg Hunter is my other amti-spy and, to be hinest, the better of the two. The revolver has a high chance of knocking the enemy down, leaving the spy on the ground and paralysed, a sitting duck. 2 "Fully loaded at start of battle" weapons means he doesn't really have a need for reloading, and the high weapon quantity means he isn't as susceptible to sabotage as some of the others. However, 2 heavy weapons and no speed enhancers means that, well, he's slow. I mean, really slow. It's not too bit of a problem when he's using the revolver as it has good range, but when he switches to the HMG...</p><p>Speed and health upgrades. He's got firepower, in a way anonimity (He's a pilot, not exactly a priority class <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">), but he's vulnerable. He's basically a glass glacial cannon, glacial as in "He moves at the speed of a glacier", he can dish it out, but he can't take it.</p><p>I wanted to ask about sacrificing his anti-spy property and use the bazooka, but I think that him being anti-spy is too valuable when the only other viable anti-spy is too vulnerable to sabotage.</p><br><br><p><a href="http://i47.tinypic.com/2j3p89z.png" target="_blank">http://i47.tinypic.com/2j3p89z.png</a></p><br><br><br><p>Melando, what I consider to be one of my star troopers. He uses the rocket launcher and is effective with it. He reloads it, e's got camouflage and take cover which help with survivability. On the other hand, when he uses the FAMAS, he uses 2 other abilities: Heartbreaker and Toxic Shells. Survivor and Invincible are nice bonuses.</p><p>Something to enhance movement speed would be nice to give him.</p><p>No questions.</p><br><br><p><a href="http://i48.tinypic.com/2ez6vx3.png" target="_blank">http://i48.tinypic.com/2ez6vx3.png</a></p><br><br><p>Joni hunter...aside from the fact that he's a comms. officer which means he's a high-priority targer, he's a very powerful trooper. He's one of my 2 snipers, he has Dawnblade's only tank, decent health, invincible...he's very powerful.</p><p>Camouflage is something I'd like to give him, to make him less likely to be the first target.</p><p>One question: Should I use the Lizaro Jungle, or should I have him use the Gatling Gun, because when he uses up the Lizaro Jungle he switches to the shotgun, not the gatling gun?</p><br><br><p><a href="http://i48.tinypic.com/2qbeu7a.png" target="_blank">http://i48.tinypic.com/2qbeu7a.png</a></p><br><br><p>Mooney Brow has high firepower. The Thompson, couples with Heartbreaker allows him to deal heavy damage, while Huge Calves and Tuck 'n' Roll allows him to survive longer. Also, he's my main grenadier, for he's packing 2 grenades.</p><p>I'd like him to get a 3'rd grenade and King of Boules to make him a true grenadier.</p><p>No real questions about him.</p><br><br><p><a href="http://i50.tinypic.com/net455.png" target="_blank">http://i50.tinypic.com/net455.png</a></p><br><br><p>Finally, Samield. He's my other sniper, and my final trooper. He uses 4 weapons, and uses them: CK-Magellan, Revolver, Semi-Auto shotgun, Shotgun. He's quite fficient with the weapons, and he manages to actually pull off a win from time to time. Camouflage helps if he's not alone, due to spies/retreat.</p><p>He needs something that enhances health, otherwise he's all set.</p><p>I'm not gonna ask him questions.</p><br><br><p>Finally, 2 questions concerning the whole army:</p><p>1) What would be the best order for me to level the troopers now?</p><p>2) Is it necessary to change the order my troopers deploy and if so, what would be a good move to make?</p><br><p>I thank anyone who had the patience to read through everything I wrote here and I thank all the answers I get, as long as they're actually answers. I apologise if I wasted your time, but I hope I did'nt really waste time.</p><p>P.S. This forum needs an image feature.</p>

Orlaley Jr - it's aweful. Hasn't any speed and aim, accuracy improvers, has useless for these shotguns Battle-ready. Both shotguns - most slowest in their class. DBS's (double barelled shotgun) shoots are so powerful, that need not explosive or poison ammos. And even if use explosive ammos, damage so big, that poison shells don't work, because usually after shot from DBS with EA (expl. ammo) any normall foe will be die. Think, this trooper usually kills one enemy and after that dies (if, of course, he had time to take aim, because his shotguns very slow in handling).<br>Interceptor doesn't work too, right? Because Orlaly goes forward, where grenades fly rarely - troopers rarely throw grenades under themselves. <br>Soldier skill, GG (glue gren) and Take cover (and Interceptor, but rarely) - his most powerfull sides. With battle-ready he need any semi-automatic weapon - magellan, dual berettas, famas or machine gun or any else (but not shotguns). About poison ammo - it's useless, he kills or misses, there is no place for a poison.</p><p>3 Hulkey - if you need a spies killer - choose knife. He has great speed of using, and with onpoint it will be cool (and much cooler will be next - knife can't do friendly fire)</p>

Stick with the Revolver first, it has good range so moving into position won't be a problem. Too many Sniper and Bazooka units clustered together is a Spy's dream situation, a Revolver has good properties on it's own that make it good(and my personal favorite weapon) such as single-target(team target friendly), good range(assault friendly), knock-down(anti-unit), and fully loaded(kill streaks). What you should note is how your units cycle through weapons, which do they tend to reload and which do they skip once they use up the clip. Try changing up the favorite weapon to see if it's efficient for him to shoot a bazooka then see if he wastes time reloading(bad) or cycles to the revolver(great) and then see if he switches to the other weapons(fine), switches to bazooka and reloads(bad) or reloads revolver(okay), or if he starts with revolver if he cycles to the bazooka(good), etc. see where I'm going with this?</p><br><br><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_523239 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="523239">Xtremekiwi</span></span><cite><br><br><br><p>Joni hunter...aside from the fact that he's a comms. officer which means he's a high-priority targer, he's a very powerful trooper.</p><p>One question: Should I use the Lizaro Jungle, or should I have him use the Gatling Gun, because when he uses up the Lizaro Jungle he switches to the shotgun, not the gatling gun?</p><br></cite><p>Stick with Lizaro, keeping him alive is important but making him useful is just as important.

Level them as you see needed, whether it be preference or favoritism. Actually a few levels I wish I never took on some of my units because it drastically changed their effectiveness and strategy(Better: Wizard, Hero, Cleric, Bard; Worse: Barbarian, Sorcerer, Rogue)</p><p>At this point I would actually look into adding another unit, offset the large amount of heavy weaponry into a spread of the 3 waves(4-4-2).</p><p>2. From what I've seen, there's a large imbalance of long range units in your force, making you pretty easy for clustered deaths. Even if you change to short range weapons you still have the heavy weight slowing you down. But to make the best of a bad situation:</p><p>At time of making this my bias is actually pretty high so don't take everything too literally. Many of what I say can actually be offset because I don't watch matches outside of my own that often so my personal strategies will conflict my judgement.</p><p>Total Units: 9<br>Maximum Waves: 3<br>Spy Threat: High (Many heavy weapon units, even with movement speed they'll still either be next to them(Snipers) or be team kill threats(Machine Guns))<br>Survival Options: Low-Mid [D+ to C](Thanks to higher HP Units, doesn't dissuade 1HKO)<br>Offense: Mid [C+ to B](All units have useful supplementary weapons SAB issue is minimal)<br>Synergy: Mid [C- to C+] (While you have selected optimal skills and options it's a shame you were dealt the classes each of your units have in that order, luckily you have a good mix and pray that you get a Spy and a Sab. You also seem to lack a comeback unit, once your formation falls there's no one in your unit that combines livability and offense, considering your Comms. are snipers which would be fine if your last wave had another unit to support it with my suggestion you won't have an initiative comeback option, which is why I suggest getting a 10th unit because the last wave is very important IMO.)</p><br><br><p>Wave 1:<br>1. Melando (Rocket Launcher, Soldier *Survivor*)<br>2. Samield (CK-Magellan, Comms.)<br>3. Hulkey (Assault Rifle, Munitions)<br>4. Kevo (Gatling Gun, Medic)</p><p>I've considered 3 things in this formation, Range, Light Tank deployment, and 1 Spy deployment. In this I've combined 2 Long Range(1 fast, 1 slow) to cover Kevo's assault. Of course Hulkey will contend with shock troopers and spies and support Kevo as another striker.</p><p>What I also note that if Joni Hunter does deploy Light Tank he will have Melando and Samield in long-range support while they are being protected by an armored Light Tank in front(This is exactly my own Light Tank deployment strategy, however executed differently because of my Bait and Spy options).</p><p>With either the Tank being launched or a spy being deployed, I placed Kevo last in this wave because in worst case scenarios you first wave is immediately wiped. This is where Kevo can balance out the battlefield by coming in with the deployment initiative bonus on 2nd wave and support a survivor Melando.</p><p>Wave 2:<br>0. Melando<br>1. Mooll (Infernal Tube, Comms.)<br>2. Ederg Hunter (Revolver, Pilot)<br>3. Mooney Brow (Thompson, Soldier)<br>4. Joni Hunter (Lizaro Jungle, Comms.)</p><p>I have considered 1 thing in this wave, 1 Spy deployment and Melando taking up a deployment slot for wave 2 with Survivor aka if Joni Hunter isn't deployed in this wave nor as a tank. Revolver is a good ranged weapon already so having him as a long range attack is important so you are not encroached while Mooll is preparing to fire.</p><p>Wave 3:<br>1. Orlaley Jr</p><p>What sucks about this is that his interception skill may be highly wasted in this position. However he is the only unit that shows any promise to clean up a confrontation other than Kevo, but he's needed for early suppression and support.</p><p>However the optimal situation is that Joni Hunter is also deployed in this wave, where he can maintain a clutch Comms. bonus and provide long range support to Orlaley Jr.</p><br><br><p>This entire proceeding has my own personal bias written through it. If you find these strategies and opinions invalid, by all means criticize or ignore it. But it was kinda fun looking into this, in terms of weaponry our armies are almost the same, minus the 3 spies and class synergy. So my overall message is make your army bigger, more bodies means more targets that can live and more damage you can deal.</p>

                <p>Let me know how the wave formation works, post battles etc. I want to compare the similarities between yours and my armies. Like I said before you have pretty much the same weapon layout as me in the main loadouts, we only differ in survival skills, the size of our armies, classes, and that I have 3 spies that make my army effectively different. I can observe my strategy in a neutral state, even with a tank deployment and survivor luckily.</p><p>I put a lot of emphasis on the large amounts of heavy weapons you held, but I only made that observation because your army is smaller than my own. In reality half of my army carries heavy weapons.</p><p>Wave comparison</p><p>Wave 1:<br>1. Melando (Rocket Launcher, Soldier *Survivor*) Long<br>2. Samield (CK-Magellan, Comms.) Long<br>3. Hulkey (Assault Rifle, Munitions) Mid<br>4. Kevo (Gatling Gun, Medic) Short</p><p>A. Wizard (DBS, Spy) Short<br>B. Rogue (PAS, Spy) Short<br>0. Paladin (AK-47, Spy) Mid<br>1. Fighter (Infernal Tube, Comms. *Survivor*) Long<br>2. Bard (CK-Magellan, Munitions) Long<br>3. Ranger (M16, Comms. *Survivor* *Talky-Walky*) Mid<br>4* Cleric (PAS, Medic) Short<br>5* Druid (CK-Magellan) Long</p><p>As you can see how many variables I have to consider compared to you, but if you look at our 1-4 it's very much the same. From what I can tell you I have had much success with this formation. I can observe your application of my strategy and hopefully I can compare the effectiveness of it solo and the true impact my classes and spies really have on my army.</p><p>Also if you care to know...</p><p>-A and B represent possible spy deployments if I'm dealing with an average opponent with 8-11 units.<br>-0 represents a deployment if I'm dealing with the same situation, he will deploy into first wave making this a completely different kind of wave.<br>-I denote that Ranger carries a Talky-Walky because it vastly changes my later waves' dynamics as well as effects first wave effectiveness. Which leads into 4* and 5*<br>-The most interesting variable I made sure to account for was against enemy spies and deploying tanks aka having only 3 units to account for. In either case, whether him being in wave 2 or being called in by Ranger via Talky-Walky, having Cleric come at a later time gives him ample opportunity to support my survivor units and offset his short range. Druid on the otherhand comes in when I already have the upperhand in numbers in which case he effectively supports long range for my closer ranged spies and Ranger and carries higher life and survivor while being supported by my slower Cleric.</p><p>On paper if we were to fight I'll give us an average carry out with the possibility of you winning.</p><p>Wave 1:<br>1. Melando (Rocket Launcher, Soldier *Survivor*) Long<br>2. Samield (CK-Magellan, Comms.) Long<br>3. Hulkey (Assault Rifle, Munitions) Mid<br>A. Wizard (DBS, Spy) Short -Weakest-</p><p>0. Paladin (AK-47, Spy) Mid -Weakest-<br>1. Fighter (Infernal Tube, Comms. *Survivor*) Long -Biggest Threat-<br>2. Bard (CK-Magellan, Munitions) Long -Easiest-<br>3. Ranger (M16, Comms. *Survivor* *Talky-Walky*) Mid -Closest-<br>4* Cleric (PAS, Medic) Short -Closest-</p><p>Already you can tell you are at a disadvantage (6 vs 3). This is the very scenario I depicted for your wave 1 order, however you won't always be fighting someone as strong as me, this is just to show how strong this can be.</p><p>Let's say in this case Cleric Saviors a unit(Bard) and both our waves die (Thanks to the next wave).</p><p>Wave 2:<br>0. Melando [He takes up a deployment count]<br>1. Kevo (Gatling Gun, Medic) Short<br>2. Mooll (Infernal Tube, Comms.) Long<br>3. Ederg Hunter (Revolver, Pilot) Mid</p><p>0. Fighter [He takes up a deployment count] -Biggest Threat-<br>0. Ranger [He takes up a deployment count] -Closest-<br>1. Druid (CK-Magellan, Soldier) Long -Easiest-<br>2. Barbarian (Infernal Tube, Munitions) Long -Biggest Threat-</p><p>I don't include weapon ranges on Survivor units because they always lose the weapon they are using so it's too variable to really account for.</p><p>This is the case in which Kevo can shine and press an advantage for your team. On an average army you won't deal with squishy units like mine, however Kevo can still be effective because of the initiative bonus for an incoming wave. However let's see our last waves assuming we both our waves die. This is assuming Wizard and Rogue don't flat out destroy you.</p><p>Wave 3.<br>1. Mooney Brow (Thompson, Soldier) Mid<br>2. Joni Hunter (Lizaro Jungle, Comms.) Long<br>3. Orlaley Jr (DBS, Soldier) Short<br>A. Rogue (PAS, Spy) -Weakest-</p><p>1. Sorcerer (Lizard Jungle, Medic) Long -Easiest-<br>2. Hero (Minigun, Sab) Short -Closest-<br>3. Monk (SAS, Comms. ) Short -Weakest-<br>4* Bard (CK-Magellan, Munitions) Long -Easiest-</p><p>So other than the fact that 12 vs 9 is obviously in my favor, there are plenty of armies that can get me down to this last wave, which reflects my main points, the last wave is very important and get a bigger army. Unless an army dominates in the first wave you will have to outlast one another. Typically spies will be exhausted in effectiveness during the early waves(except in this scenario, we can easily assume most opponents will only have 1 spy) so they shouldn't be accounted for(It's just easy for me to make this scenario because I know my army like the back of my hand). Hopefully you can see exactly how effective the waves I made for you, and in effect you can get me down this far if you were to fight me(and survive Wizard's onslaught). Just imagine how it works against armies nearer to your power.</p><p>In all the waves you'll note that you have a mixed assortment of ranges, it's important that you always aim for different targets, specifically longer ranged units, so you offset time wasted once a target is dead since all long range weapons take forever to aim. I noted exactly how my army aims for targets and hopefully I won't have to explain my pattern to you.</p><p>Please do post your bouts so I can make notes and adjustments. <img src="http://fever.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/rec/item_15.gif" alt=":fever_fice_1:" class="tid_img tid_parsed" style=""></p>

                <p>Ah, Moncappy's is a strange opponent, he effectively shuts down his enemies by overwhelming them in number. I mean I counted 9 vs 2 and on incoming 2nd wave he has a Reverse Attack. It is an effective early all or nothing strategy. So damn he needs a different strategy involving using up more useless units first and pushing back late game as his 2nd wave is nothing.</p><p>How about facing a not so complicated opponent. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Also note that you're dealing with a full army 60 power stronger than you. My strategy deals with armies more around your level, I can only consider higher level opponents because I too have a full army.</p>

                <p>I forgot to note that Druid has Survivor also, so in our scenario vs I would have a 4th wave with Bard instead of him being in the 3rd wave.</p><p>I would honestly be scared to face Moncappy's myself. He has 3 spies and 2 scouts so my only early advantage is that my spies are better than his and that his scouts will allow my spies to spy deploy very early.</p><p>In my best case it would be.</p><p>Wave 1:</p><p>A. ML Spy 1<br>B. ML Spy 2<br>1. Fighter<br>2. Bard</p><p>A. Wizard<br>B. Rogue<br>1. ML Unit<br>2. ML Unit<br>3. ML Unit<br>4. ML Unit</p><p>4 Against 6, however I have the advantage in terms of initiative and Frenetic spies and a Bait unit making my job much easier. My army is also deceitful in that 3 of my units have Survivor and I have a doctor with Savior effectively making my army size 16. Also this is where a comeback unit would come in most handy, but putting him in 2nd wave would be great instead of last wave. But of course that is an army specific strategy. I have comebacks in terms of my spies and Hero and Monk duo. Unlike Moncappy's all or nothing blitzkrieg my strategy and the one I gave you concentrates on dragging out the battle in a balanced and more zoned spacing. It works out for me, without taking account of the spies, because my individual units have survivor options that allow them to outlast many opponents.</p><br><p>My units are level 11-12 so it's not that much stronger than you, but that of course could be the difference, in reality get more defensive skills.<br>Wizard: Tuck-n-Roll, BPV, Take Cover<br>Rogue: Take Cover, BPV, FMB<br>Paladin: Camouflage, First Aid, BPV <br>Fighter: Lucky Charm, Survivor<br>Bard: Bait, Bounce Back<br>Range: Tuck-n-Roll, Survivor<br>Doctor: Tuck-n-Roll<br>Druid: Soldier HP, Survivor, Unshakable<br>Barbarian: BPV, Camouflage, Suspicious, Tuck-n-Roll<br>Sorcerer: Lucky Charm, First Aid Kit<br>Hero: Zig-Zag, BPV, Bounce Back, Take Cover<br>Monk: Tuck-n-Roll + Being insanely fast</p><p>Compared to your units:</p><p>*Looks through the list again*<br>Well never mind you have "plenty" of survival, I mean high HP and at least 1 dodge skill. I'm probably much luckier than most armies so I can't expect the same things.</p><p>I just think you need a bigger army before you contend with stronger armies, consider halting your progress in CC until you have a bigger army. Get some confidence and watch where your army shines with wins.</p>

                <p>This is going to be tough for me, considering I always think about the larger army metagame instead of the newer folk. I always keep an eye on things like speed, initiative, and survival which are important to large armies. In smaller armies though it seems the quicker trigger i the winner. So I'll try my best not to be too biased on the metagame that I have to follow.</p><br><br><br><p>Unit Overview:</p><p>Yuri<br>Class: None<br>Weapons: PAS, Shotgun<br>Equipment: Toxic Shells<br>Skills: Trigger Happy, Survival Instincts</p><p>Unfortunately Trigger Happy doesn't these shotguns. Luckily not carrying a heavy weapon and can advance to a place to unload poison goodies.</p><p>Bowman<br>Class: Doctor<br>Weapons: CK-Magellan, FAMAS, Shotgun<br>Equipment: Gas Grenade<br>Skills: On Point, Sprinter</p><p>This shows promise in your army. Medics as sniper units allow him to be further from assault close range units and be close to your army. Definitely helps that he won't aimlessly charge first in your field since he is your fastest unit.</p><p>GhostSpectre<br>Class: None<br>Weapons: Gatling Gun, Shotgun<br>Equipment: FMB<br>Skills: Survival Instincts, Commando, Huge Calves</p><p>I noticed that this is your 2nd wave unit, honestly you don't have much of a better choice there.</p><p>Francis<br>Class: None<br>Weapons: Knife, Shotgun<br>Equipment: None<br>Skills: Battle-Ready, Nimble Fingers, Cold Blooded, Survival Instinct</p><p>I hope you start with Shotgun over Knife. He isn't fast enough to be real effective with a Knife.</p><p>Jay<br>Class: None<br>Weapons: Bazooka M25, Sniper<br>Equipment: Loader, Hydroshock Shells<br>Skills: Tuck-n-Roll</p><p>This is leading to a more balanced unit.</p><p>It seems you don't need much in terms of critique, you've optimized as much as you can.</p><p>Offense: You have a balance in terms of range, you actually have the starting setup(save the knife -&gt; shotgun that I suggest) that I would have selected.<br>Survival: Save for Jay and Ghost, you have little in terms of outlasting your opponent. Guess that's to be expected.</p><p>Synergy: Surprisingly you covered your units correctly in my opinion.</p><p>Overall: Too early to tell where this army will stand.</p>

                <p>Great job on the vid for Freeze!<br>Only watch part two so far, just about to hunt up part one.<br>Really awesome to look at that army through someone else's eyes... especially the eyes of someone who so obviously has such a strong grasp on this game and what works.</p><p>As a point of note regarding the snipers, Moran was set to target the easiest while Palmasino was drawing a bead on the biggest threat.<br>Just chance that they ended up being the same guy, I suppose. Probably more likely with equal HP and levels for the enemies.<br>I usually put all my frenetic troopers to target weakest - I'm sure there was a reason I went for easiest this time around, but I don't remember what it was.</p><p>I sincerely hope that you've gotten a taste for this and keep making more videos now <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>A note on some of the decisions I did end up making. I'm not happy with all of them but I've played this army since I started mini troopers and didn't get a firm grasp on what exactly was good/bad until about 4-5 troops in.</p><p>Starting wave is usually 6 as I think I have another out of bounds trooper... Again early decisions with not much thought on the effects ended up with me regretting out of bounds as choices. Works very much against me against a bad rocket <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>I'll work on getting some replays up for you to get a better grasp of the crap that can and does happen.</p>

                <p>Also, as a side note for out of bounds. It only works on that particular trooper so yes its a scout affect but you have to set it up differently as it only works for that one trooper. It's a little tricky and I think I'll be moving those 2 troopers all over to see exactly how it will work out... So far I've been ending up with 1 trooper coming out on 3rd wave which I'm not liking at all.</p><br><p>Thanks for the ideas though, it has actually made me think about switching around the order so I'm not so first wave heavy (I never wanted that and don't like that). Also, got me to switch where tanks come in which is more of a wave 1 and 2 or maybe he comes out on his own for the 3rd wave with a tank... Could be good after all the rockets have flown for wave 2.</p><br><p>How does survivor work for deployment points? Cause that seems to be throwing me off... If I look at my army on paper I should now have a 4 (5 if spy deploys) man first wave then 5 (6 if spy deploys) man second wave... I seem to be getting 4/5 then 4/5 then 1 which doesn't make sense with 2 out of bounds troops.</p><br><p>Trust me, I made it to 8th in the CC yes but I'm in a rut atm and can't get too much farther further so I figured input might gimme a push or at least give some direction. Also, if all the armies in the CC were actively pursuing moving forward I would probably be closer to 15th... Just sayin.</p>
