                <p>Ok before I go HAM all on this, this is just another idea. I need input on scoring (how much for each value and additional criteria). Once again I will also be in charge of organizing, however this idea will require tons less work from people, but probably more thought input.</p><p>So yeah many of my ideas are convoluted and require lots of work. But this one I think everyone can appeal to.</p><p>So for anyone who doesn't know what a Fantasy League is basically take different members of different teams and create a team. Depending on the sport, statistics of each player are gathered and evaluated, then converted into a total point value for the created team.</p><p>I've wondered a little bit which members of which teams statistically are better, of course we won't know 100% and team synergy does play a lot of role in a successful army, but in this way we can see a little how in our eyes which units together would make the strongest MT team.</p><p>The only effort I need from people is to post replays from the other game threads into a single forum with participating troopers so I can organize data and creating their own draft picks. It's better this way so that people fighting each other end up fighting armies around their skill level and have a chance to showcase units(most of the time).</p><p><strong>Here's how I would organize this:</strong></p><p><strong>Team Draft</strong></p><p>-Each participant selects units from active forum players' armies. An active army must have a posted replay on the forums within at least a week of their last replay.<br>-Each player will compose their team of...</p><p>An "active" Comms.<br>An "active" Sab.<br>An "active" Doctor<br>A Spy<br>4 non-spy units</p><p>-"Active" units will have an additional individual scoring card while all 8 units will have a universal scoring. These individual scores will add points based on additional things these units can do.<br>-Each participant can only select up to 2 units from an individual army.<br>-Keep in mind that things such as Sab% and Comms. Points, while communal among whole armies, will still count as an individual score. I will justify this because the units put forth their contribution. Keep this in mind when selecting these units from teams.<br>-Use of Vehicles is something I'm unsure of still. I'm more inclined to include a special scoring for vehicle use, or null and void replays involving vehicles for all participation.</p><p><strong>How the league will work:</strong></p><p>After drafts have been made participants will be organized into a tournament or round robin bracket(depending on interest). Once replays are organized in each bout Iâ€™ll tally up points for each individual units and then they are totalled together on each made team. Whoever has the highest score for that scoring timeframe will get the win.</p><p>Replays used to create a score will be taken from active forum threads. Keep in mind that an armies overall Victory or Defeat will not matter, what matters is the performance of the individual units.</p><p><strong>Common threads to look for strong units.</strong><br>-Continuous Championship<br>-Championship Sixes<br>-The Belt Series/King of the Hill<br>-Tournament Cups<br>-Challenge the Person Above You<br>-Share Your Fights Here</p><p>You may also look in other threads, but these are the most common.</p><p><strong>Scoring Criteria:</strong><br>(Point values TBD)</p><p><strong>Universal Scoring:</strong></p><p>Accuracy:<br>(Hits vs Miss and 0s divided by total bullets/fists/kicks/throws/stabs fired, does include grenades that cause damage)<br>Vitality Ratio:<br>(Life Left divided by Total Life, 0 Value on unit death)<br>Kills:<br>Team Kills(Minus Points):</p><p><em>Things I may consider adding</em><br>Use of equipment:<br>Kill Streaks:<br>Team Kill Streaks:<br>Vehicle Involvement:<br>Important Plays/Skill Usage:<br>(Such as Interception, Covering Fire, Frenetic, and more)<br>Wave Multipliers:<br>(If a unit appears in a later wave I may increase their point value. Unsure of the true impact based on this though)</p><p><strong>"Active" Comms.</strong></p><p>Comms. Command Activates:</p><p><em>Things I may consider adding</em><br>Higher up commands having more or additional value.</p><p><strong>"Active" Sab.</strong></p><p>Sabotaged Weapons:<br>(Value per each weapon Sab'd)</p><p><strong>"Active" Doctor</strong></p><p>Doctor Heal and Savior:<br>(Value per each time a unit is healed with Doctor command and Savior)<br>Doctor Remove Debuff:<br>(Value per each time the doctor removes a debuff)</p><br><p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p><p>I'm looking for input for importance and values and other scoring criteria.<br>The only thing I ask of people for participation is in creating draft teams and posting replays from the other threads. Everything else I can do.</p>

                <p>This sounds really interesting. I'm amazed that you're prepared to take on the work of stat. keeping for individual troopers... amazed and a little bit frightened!</p><p>I would certainly like to get involved, either as a team-manager-player or perhaps just sending some interesting challenges with one or more of my armies, if my troopers are chosen by other managers.</p><p>My only concern is the variation in activity level between players, and how this might affect the balance of the scoring.<br>For example, there are many days when I don't actually do any fights with my army at all other than to collect the Raid coins. So, maybe my troopers might not be the most reliable scoring prospects!</p><p>I'm hoping to have some free time over the weekend for Minitroopering. I'll do my best to have a more thorough read of the ideas you've already set out, then see if I can offer you any useful feedback or suggestions for the scoring architecture.</p>

                <p>To work with some things I was considering keeping an average of all unit performance within a time frame and use that. Like a weeks worth of replays. Cause I'm sure like you said plus my concerns about picking units in later waves that may not get to perform at all. It really doesn't take much effort to calculate these things.</p><p>And it won't take much work for participants either, just make a draft a team and then find replays from the day to day active threads and repost them here. If anything it will incline people to select active armies to score a better average total. And since the Big 5(or 7 depending on how you look at it) are always competing with one another their units average may be lower than someone curb stomping in Championship Sixes. It's things like this that I can't take note by myself, but if people put an interest in those units then I'll know what to look for rather than having to scan every single army.</p>
