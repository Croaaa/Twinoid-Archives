                <p><strong>Replay in Words 1</strong><br>Since this is the first week, I will analyze this replay from pickupsticks:<br><a href="http://knife-fighters.minitroopers.co..." target="_blank">http://knife-fighters.minitroopers.co...</a><br>I will start with the lineups:<br><strong>KNIFE FIGHTERS (RED side):</strong><br>Zen Warrior (Munitions 11 )<br>Bull (Comms. Officer 9 )<br>Pinpoint (Comms. Officer 8 )<br>Rabbit (Scout 9 )<br>Gremlin (Saboteur 9 )<br><strong>DR. FRENETIC (VIOLET side):</strong><br>Burterg Jr (Soldier 9 )<br>Bomba Samer (Doctor 8 )<br>Yull (Spy 8 )<br>Rickiham (Saboteur 7 )<br>Keverg (Pilot 8 )<br><strong>PREVIEW:</strong><br>Knife Fighter goes for the “knife-themed” build which involves speed and timing. In addition, he has equipped Loader on two of his troopers, so that in case the knives don’t work, they would be able to use their weapons efficiently even at close range. A possible weakness would be the “shotgun-HMG strat”, which involves having lots of shotguns and firepower to take down the otherwise melee-based army.<br>In the meanwhile, Dr. Frenetic goes for the rather standard “Spy+Speed+HMG” and “Launcher+HMG Abuse” strategies, which work because of the intense firepower and area of effect (AoE) damage at hand. A notable thing to note is that he has speed buffs on his army; maybe he wants to engage his opponent quickly. He should be vulnerable to the "Spy+Twinoid+HMG+On Point" combo.<br>Both sides have Poison Grenades in addition to standard ones; although this will not have much of an impact on the game (as Knife Fighters has only one Munitions trooper). On the other side, both of them have Saboteurs which will surely make an impact in this game...In what way will it be? Let's find out together!<br>Will the knives win? Or will the classic “metal rain” take this game? Let’s find out!<br><strong>MATCH:</strong><br>In the first part of the match, all of Dr. Frenetic’s troopers get deployed. Pinpoint is put into the reserves, and as of the moment, Yull’s HMG is sabotaged, as well as minor weapons from both sides.<br>Yull and Zen Warrior go into a practical 1v1 match as the rest of the cast watches…Both of them dodge and take some damage; however, Gremlin has knifed the spy to the death.<br>Bomba Samers throws a poison grenade which hits all of Knife Fighter’s troopers except Bull; the Red side has its hands full right now.<br>Both sides start to shoot at each other; Zen Warrior rushes in with his shotgun and reduces Burterg Jr’s HP by half, and Keverg throws a grenade that sends Rabbit flying into the air…dead.<br>With only one charge, Bull kills Burterg in a flash, and thanks to a solo mission buff, he is able to do one more and knock Rickiham to the ground. He dies after a few more blows, and the tanky Comms. Officer has started to wreak havoc all over the place. All this time, Zen Warrior has suffered from the poison, and he quickly dies hereafter.<br>It took two revolvers and some fists to knock down Bull, and all of a sudden, only one remains: Pinpoint. While he comes into the field, Frenetic’s Doctor healed Burterg Jr, and it just means more trouble for the Red side: With weapons and fists at the ready, they can overwhelm the Comms. Officer in a matter of moments!<br>But then, a surprise happens: Pinpoint activates his solo mission, and Keverg goes down after three shots! Burterg follows thereafter, and only the brave doctor remained…Moments later, he died, and it was GG for Dr. Frenetic.<br><strong>POSTVIEW:</strong><br><strong>Man of the Match:</strong> Bull (for helping Knife Troopers maintain a presence throughout the game)<br><strong>Flop of the Match:</strong> Yull (since his HMG got sabotage, he wasn’t able to do his work. And it is well-known that Frenetic’s spies are deadly when they do their job.)<br><strong>Breaking Point:</strong> When Rickiham missed that Infernal Tube shot, he lost a chance to secure a very large advantage.<br><strong>Final Notes:</strong> Even with Yull’s failure and Bull’s presence, the match could have gone Dr. Frenetic’s way. However, it seemed that the Violet side’s firepower did not come into play in this game, which meant that he has lost control of an important part of the game.<strong><br>The replay was fun, so I’m giving 8/10. Lots of things to learn too from this game.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Replay In Words 2</strong><br>Hi guys!<img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>This is &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams churning out another “Replay In Words” section. This week, we’re gonna have a classic final match between Dime and 971marSu!<br>As usual, we’re gonna start with the lineups:<br><strong>DIME (RED Side):</strong><br>Armor King (Soldier 10)<br>Bryan Fury (Comms. Officer 11)<br>Marshall Law (Saboteur 12)<br>Raven (Munitions 11)<br>Paul Phoenix (Saboteur 11)<br>Jin Kazama (Saboteur 10)<br>Gun Jack (Soldier 11)<br>Bruce Irvin (Munitions 10)<br>Eddy Gordo (Doctor 12)<br><strong>971marSu (GREEN Side):</strong><br>Cool : ] (Saboteur 10)<br>Story <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> (Scout 9)<br>Bro (: (Scout 10)<br>Wazzup ? (Munitions <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"><br>marSu =) (Saboteur 11)<br>971 (Saboteur 10)<br>All in! (Pilot 12)<br>BAMBAM ! (Comms. Officer 11)<br>Wazzaaaa x) (Spy 13)<br>9GAG (: (Soldier 10)<br>SUMAR ) (Comms. Officer 12)<br><strong>PREVIEW:</strong><br>Anyone can see immediately that both sides utilize “Twinoid+Saboteur+Magnet” strategies in their lineups. Considering that these are very good seeded players, one can assume that the builds they use are “standard” in the Minitroopers world.<br>Twinoid is a very effective skill: It gives a trooper the ability to contribute to the player’s momentum, while Saboteurs are very strong for obvious reasons. Both sides equip Loaders, Lucky Charms, Coffee Thermos, and Scavengers in their armies, and it is quite interesting to note that while the red side equips Laser Sights and Barrel Extensions, the green side equips Heat Sensors, which indicates these things:<br>1. Dime will try to engage his enemy from afar and suppress him within a distance. However, this will leave him vulnerable to launcher-type and area of effect (AoE) weapons; he tries to compensate for this with the Thermos to make his troops spread out.<br>2. 971marSu, on the other hand, will try to use “grenade abuse” before going in and cleaning up his opponent’s army. A Walky-Talky would really help to call in more firepower; in any manner, he will try to engage his enemy in a standard infantry fashion.<br>So the question is: Will Dime’s “distance tactic” work? Or will 971marSu’s “precise firepower tactic” bring him the championship? Let’s see!<br><strong>MATCH:<br>RED Side:<br>1st Wave: Marshall Law, Paul Pheonix, Armor King, Raven<br>GREEN Side:<br>1st Wave: Wazzup ?, All in !, Wazzaaaa x), marsu =), SUMAR )</strong><br>Sumar starts opens the battle with a Twinoid, and with Wazzaaaa x)’s tank in the field, it is clear from the very beginning that Dime will be in big trouble. While the saboteurs’ effects start to make their presence, All in ! uses his Walky-Talky, and Story <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"> comes in to provide more long-range fire. Immediately afterwards, the tank opens fire, but only manages to reduce Armor King’s life by 25 points.<br>Meanwhile, Raven lobs a Frag Grenade that hits everyone on 971marSu’s team. Story dies from the shrapnel damage, and both sides are on a long-range battle with each other. Paul Phoenix rushes and tries to knife everyone to the death, and in the heat of the battle, Armor King goes down. marSu =) punched the Red rusher six feet down the grave, and Wazzup ? throws a frag that did not do any substantial damage.<br>The tank becomes a real problem, as it took down Raven with a shot from its cannon. Wazzup shoots Marshall Law, and the wave ends for Dime.<strong><br>RED Side:<br>2nd Wave: Eddy Gordo, Bruce Irvin, Gun Jack, Bryan Fury</strong><br>This is the chance for Dime to destroy that light tank; if he is able to do it, he will be able to have a shot at beating 971marSu’s army (considering that there are no rockets on his team), but if he doesn’t do so, then the tank will practically roll over him and his remaining forces.<br>Gunjack takes the Twinoid and knives marSu =) down; then he proceeds to melee the tank! In the meantime, someone threw a frag and did substantial damage to the rest of the Green side; however, the tank just glanced it off!<br>It took SUMAR ), All in !, and the tank’s machine gun to take Gun Jack down. However, with Dime’s HMG team sabotaged, it would be very hard for him to take the Green armor down.<br>Commando comes in for 971marSu’s squad, but it does nothing. Eddie Gordon takes the Twinoid and kills All in ! and SUMAR ) in succession. Only Wazzaaaa x) and his troublesome tank remains, and he starts his rampage by taking out Eddy Gordo, then Bruce Irvin, and then finally Bryan Fury.<br>Only one guy remains for Dime: Jin Kazama. By then, it was basically GG for Dime, and it took only two Tuck n’Rolls, a miss, a salvo, and then a Faceboot to kill Jin Kazama down.<br>With that end, 971marSu takes the trophy with him.<br><strong>POST VIEW:</strong><br><strong>Man of the Match:</strong> Wazzaaaa x) really did a great job at maintaining the Green side’s dominance throughout the game. ‘Nuff said.<br><strong>Flop of the Match:</strong> Though I’m tempted to say that the two rushers (Gun Jack and Eddie Gordon) cost Dime the game, it is actually Bruce Irvin and Bryan Fury who should be blamed for not being able to open up that opportunity for Dime to claw back his way into the match.<br><strong>Breaking Point:</strong> When Marshall Law’s launcher got sabotaged, Dime lost two options:<br>1. To dish out damage on the tightly-packed Green side<br>2. To have a chance at destroying the tank<br>By losing these options, Dime had to resort to his last option: wait for his HMG-Twinoid mix, and they were not able to do their job tooo in the end.<br><strong>FINAL NOTES:</strong><br>971marSu lost only a couple of troops in that game. In addition, Dime has faced his army’s weakness: launcher-type weapons. However, the game could have just gone his way if he was able to have his Infernal Tube and HMG teams with him. In fact, 971marSu’s troops were vulnerable to AoE damage (the two frag grenades from Dime have showed it), and he could have capitalized on that.<br><strong>Overall, 7/10. Great match, great viewing value, and certain things to learn:</strong><br>1. Tanks should be taken out ASAP if they exist in an enemy’s army.<br>2. Twinoid does not work 100% all the time, thanks to the not-so-smart behavior of the troops.<br>3. They are examples of how an army should be: NO friendly fire!<br><strong>That’s all guys! Hope you enjoy!!!</strong><img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>REPLAY IN WORDS # 3<br>Once again, this is &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams going in for another Replay In Words session! This time around, it’s not gonna be a classical tournament, but nevertheless it will be a pretty fun replay!<br>Here’s the link:<br>http:<a href="http://dawnblade.minitroopers.com/b/fview/10288487" target="_blank">http://dawnblade.minitroopers.com/b/f...</a><br>Apparently, it’s a normal match between Dawnblade and Donatelo, and we’re gonna see it in a few moments! Here are the lineups:<br>DAWNBLADE (Left side)<br>Samield (Comms. Officer 9)<br>Mooney Brow (Soldier 9)<br>Hulkey (Munitions 9)<br>Ederg Hunter (Pilot 9)<br>Mool (Comms. Officer 9)<br>Orlaley Jr (Soldier 9)<br>Melando (Soldier 9)<br>DONATELO (Right side)<br>Smithenser (Saboteur 10)<br>Melakins (Saboteur 10)<br>G.I.Huffney (Soldier 10)<br>Harrenser (Scout 10)<br>Harrones (Saboteur 9)<br>Bronnell (Spy 10)<br>Harru (Spy 9)<br>If you’ve noticed, I’ve used the “left” and “right” for naming instead of calling them by theircolor. This setup would be implemented in later Replay in Words portions as well!<br>THE PREVIEW:<br>Dawnblade seems to rely on his Comms.Officers to make his launcher-heavy army deliver the goods. As for their equipment, it is clear that he is going for the common “launcher+AoE” strat, thanks to the presence of automatic weapons and grenades all over his army. There is one Twinoid, First Aid, and an assortment of shells and other gear; this army is just one heavy juggernaut.<br>But it does NOT come with a price. This buildup is well-known to be weak to spies, which IS JUST the kind of ARMY that he is about to face!<br>Donatelo also relies on the “Launcher+AoE” strat, but with a twist: Saboteurs will try to disable the main weapons of the opposing side, while his spies will either soften them up or set up the rival’s army for some launcher abuse!<br>This is gonna be an explosive match! Let’s watch the game!!!<br>THE GAME:<br>FIRST WAVE:<br>Dawnblade: Orlaley Jr, Mooll, Hulkey<br>Donatello: Bronnell, Harrenser, Melakins, Smithenser, Harrones, G.I. Huffuney<br>Absolutely NOTHING to watch there. Donatello just wiped out 1/3 of Dawnblade’s army, with only the spy paying the price! Let’s watch the second wave!<br>Dawnblade: Ederg Hunter, Mooney Brown, Melando, Samield<br>This is where it all starts! Samield takes down Harrenser with a headshot, then Mooney Brown lobs a grenade toward the other side, then Commando gets activated…<br>Both sides shoot each other, with Mooney Brown rolling into the ground…Samield fires a nasty gutshot and kills Smithenser! G.I. Huffuney avenges his teammates by killing Melando and damaging Mooney Brown critically…then Harrones throws the coin at the soldier to throw him out of the game.<br>Melakins fires and misses; Samield goes on a solo mission and shoots, but a Glue Grenade (GG Grenade) stops him! It’s now time to bring down Ederg Hunter, but he tucks and rolls! He shoots Harrones to death, and it’s 2v2 right now on the field…<br>Samield throws a grenade that makes G.I. Huffuney kiss the face of the earth; and Ederg Hunter gets a solo mission that almost kills Melakins. He is killed by Samield afterwards, and the tank GI kills Ederg Hunter!<br>After a short gunfight, Samield kills the soldier, and only Harru remains! Despite Harru getting the first shot, another solo mission and three shotgun shots kill the spy…and it was GG!<br>POST VIEW:<br>Man of the Match: Samield really worked hard like a mule to bring the game to the end!<br>Flop of the Match: It is hard to select one, since everyone fought really well! But since I have to choose one, I will choose Harrenser for the following reason: He made ZERO impact on the match.<br>Breaking Point: When the second spy did not appear in Dawnblade’s ranks, Samield was able to claw back into the game rapidly.<br>FINAL NOTES:<br>This match clearly shows how Comms. Officers can change the tide of the match with the things that they bring to the table.<br>In addition, I enjoyed the game thanks to its fast-paced, high-action, roller-coaster content, even though the strategies were pretty standard.<br>VERDICT: 7.5/10. Very good comeback there!<br>That’s all guys! See you next time!!!</p>

                <p>REPLAY IN WORDS#4:<br>PART 1!!!<br>KoF vs. SilentPinoy<br>Once again, this is &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams, and this replay comes from Kill League C (the place where the big boys have fun), and so I’ve decided to “cast” this match!<br>Just a few weird things: Out of curiosity, is SilentPinoy a Filipino (or has Filipino blood?) Or much beter, is KoF a Korean?? (Take note that Korea is well known for its super-imba SC2 scene!)<br>This is the battle of the armies from the virtual East! Let’s get it on!<br>PREVIEW:<br>KoFKorea (Left side):<br>KOREA, Sab 11<br>DRAGON, Soldier 10<br>RICO, Sab 10<br>CHANCE, Doctor 10<br>TEO, Comms. Officer 10<br>TUCO, Scout 10<br>LIGHT, Soldier 10<br>KITE, Spy 10<br>MORROW, Comms. Officer 10<br>FACE, Pilot 11<br>SilentPinoy (Right side):<br>Fighter, Comms.Officer 11<br>Ranger, Comms.Officer 11<br>Rogue, Spy 10<br>Wizard, Spy 10<br>Cleric, Doctor 10<br>Monk, Comms. Officer 11<br>Paladin, Spy 10<br>Bard, Munitions 10<br>Barbarian, Munitions 10<br>Sorcerer, Doctor 11<br>PREVIEW:<br>Anyone can notice that both armies use launchers, snipers, and shotguns in their lineups, with the main difference stemming from the fact that while KoF opts for a heavy-firepower spread (this has been proven in the rest of the replays I’ve casted that this is a classic here), SilentPinoy uses precise power strikes to overcome the opponent without the risk of friendly fire.<br>As for the class builds, the Red side tends to rely on Sabotage to bring down the main/vital weapons of their rivals, while the Blue side uses spies to create havoc on the enemy side.<br>No one cares about having their troops spread; in fact, it seems that they only want war! Both sides utilize grenades liberally, while SilentPinoy goes for a tanky-damage equipment build, Kingdom of Korea uses the Loader-Shell equipment build.<br>I guess it’s time to watch the match!<br>THE GAME:<br>WAVE 1:<br>Red: DRAGON, KOREA, LIGHT, FACE<br>Blue: Rogue, Bard, Fighter, Wizard, Cleric<br>SilentPinoy’s spy quickly appears on the other side of the field; however, LIGHT quickly disposes him away with one shotgun blast! In the meantime, Wizard takes the Twinoid, and he kills LIGHT afterwards. Fighter fires his launcher and fails…<br>FACE shoots Wizard, but the erudite spy acts quickly; the Red sniper tries again and fails miserably, and the rest of the troopers start to fire at each other! DRAGON finally takes the poor sky down with two Explosive Shells; and with his Solo Mission buff, he tries to take the Doctor down, but he fails badly. Cleric uses Savior to save Wizard, and the Doctor goes back into the field.<br>DRAGON takes out the Doctor with one headshot, and after a few seconds, Fighter sends KOREA flying with his Explosive Shells, and the impact kills the unlucky Sab. Both sides try to take out each other, with Bard’s solo mission sending DRAGON to oblivion! Bard kills FACE within a few seconds, and KoFKorea starts to send his second wave in.<br>2ND WAVE A:<br>Red: DRAGON (Survivor), TEO, MORROW, CHANCE, TUCO<br>Blue: Paladin<br>The blue spy brings DRAGON six feet down, and he starts wreaking havoc! MORROW has put an end to his troublemaking, though CHANCE died in the process.<br>Support comes in for the Right side: Barbarian and Ranger comes in, hoping to bring more options for the Blue side. The new Comms.Officer uses a walky-talky, and surprise!surprise! KITE comes in!<br>The Red spy kills Fighter with one charge, then kills Bard with two shotgun barrels; MORROW lobs a frag, while Barbarain throws a Shock Grenade! With one shot, Ranger and Barbarain kiss the face of the earth, and SilentPinoy’s second wave comes in!<br>2nd WAVE B:<br>Blue: Fighter &amp; Ranger (survivors), Monk, Sorcerer and Wizard (Saved)<br>This is the make-or-break wave for the Blue Side. If they win through this one, then they will have a very big advantage. And if they lose, then it’s simply gonna be GG!<br>Wizard takes the Twinoid once again in this resurrection, and he kills KITE with three shots! TUCO says goodbye to Monk and Fighter with a grenade; MORROW makes Wizard go to the grave again, and by then it was absolutely GG even when the brave Doctor remained in the field.<br>POSTVIEW:<br>MAN OF THE MATCH: Kite, for simply doing his job…and more!<br>FLOP OF THE MATCH: I’d say it must go to Cleric for doing almost nothing except to save Wizard…<br>BREAKING POINT: When Ranger called KITE into the field, it started the doom-clock for SilentPinoy.</p>

                <p>REPLAY IN WORDS#5 (WEEK 2)<br><a href="http://team-jay.minitroopers.com/b/fview/7862747" target="_blank">http://team-jay.minitroopers.com/b/fv...</a><br>This is WEEK 1’s best replay, and it has lots of action and twists in it!<br>I’ll start with the lineups, as usual:<br>DIME (Left side, Red)<br>Armor King (Soldier 10)<br>Bryan Fury (Comms. Officer 11)<br>Marshall Law (Saboteur 12)<br>Raven (Munitions 11)<br>Paul Pheonix (Saboteur 11)<br>Jin Kazama (Saboteur 11)<br>Gun Jack (Soldier 11)<br>Bruce Irvin (Munitions 10)<br>Eddy Gordo (Doctor 12)<br>TEAM JAY (Right side, Green)<br>Ol’ Painless (Scout 9)<br>Boomstick (Pilot 10)<br>Newbie (Saboteur 9)<br>Boggy B (Soldier 9)<br>Shaarpshoota (Pilot 10)<br>Penfold (Munitions 10)<br>Cnut (Soldier 10)<br>Sweep (Comms. Officer 10)<br>Pepper (Saboteur 9)<br>Thay (Munitions 9)<br>Slig (Doctor 9)*<br>NOTE: He has a 12th trooper atm, Shikari (Spy 9), but since it did not exist at the time the battle occured, I’m not including him into the lineups!<br>PREVIEW:<br>It is obvious that Team Jay has a numerically superior army; but on the other side, unlike other people, they use launchers only liberally!<br>Team Jay utilizes a shotgun-HMG heavy build; in addition, he tends to use diverse builds on his troopers that range from Binoculars to Heavy Armor, and as usual, he has Shells and Grenades on his army. This is a very diverse build that focuses on having firepower and survivabiliy (shown by the rather numerous healing devices equipped).<br>On the other hand, Dime goes for the “all-distance firepower” build; this is supported by the existence of Twinoids at all range levels (knife=melee, double pistols=long range, CK=long range) and the existence of Thermos and Scavengers.<br>Since both sides have NO SPIES at the moment the skirmish was fought, it is evident that the army with a higher rate of organization will win the game.<br>But surprises happen…and this is a game where lots of them happen!<br>Let this game begin!!!<br>MATCH STRIKE:<br>1st Wave:<br>Dime: Marshall Law, Armor King, Paul Phoenix, Raven<br>Team Jay: Boggy B, Shaarpshoota, Ol’ Painless, Boomstick, Newbie<br>At the first opportunity, Raven takes the Twinoid and starts wreaking havoc on the other side. Both sides have their main weapons sabotaged, and in the meantime, Shaarpshoota has called a Walky-Talky for Penfold. The shooting starts and a well-placed grenade from Paul Phoenix hits everyone (except for the rusher) on the other side and Newbie dies in the aftermath of the godlike explosion!<br>Bullets and kicks flew all over the battlefield, and Shaarpshoota was the first to kiss the face of the earth! Boggy B and Paul Phoenix went to the grave afterwards, thanks to a badly-timed Explosive Shell from Marshall Law. Armor King shoots Ol’ Painless in the head, and he falls lifeless to the ground! Another explosive shell takes the life of Penfold the rusher, and only Boomstick remains.<br>Thanks to a Solo Mission and a Scavenger, the green pilot takes Raven’s pistol and shoots Raven and lobs a Shock Grenade in quick succession! Boomstick takes the shot; however, three shots from the Red side have brought him six feet deep into the earth.<br>This is just the first wave, and lots of things are already happening! Let’s watch the 2nd Wave!<br>2nd Wave:<br>Part A:<br>Team Jay: Cnut, Pepper, Sling, Thay<br>Thay quickly avenges his fallen comrades with a launcher shot; he fires once again, but the tanky Armor King just simply refused to bow on his knees! However, a Loader and a Solo Mission joined together to arrange for the brave soldier’s death.<br>Only Marshall Law remains…and the action goes to another level!<br>The Saboteur kicks poor Cnut in the face; in the meantime, Thay once again fires his tube…and goes way off mark! In the meantime, fists and bullets killed Marshall Law…and he goes away for good.<br>Part B:<br>Dime: Bruce Irvin, Jin Kazama, Bryan Fury, Gun Jack<br>Gun Jack takes the Twinoid (as his comrade did at the first part of the match), and he runs and Scavenges Pepper’s shotgun! Then he rushes with his knife and starts to stab Pepper down…After a couple of stabs, Pepper rolls into the ground, and the rest of the cast move in!<br>Bruce Irvin’s well-aimed grenade has got the better of Cnut and Slig, allowing for easy cleanup by Bryan Fury; Pepper and Gun Jack continue their one on one: it is as if they have personal grudges against each other! Bruce Irvin kills Slig finally, and Gun Jack has finally disposed Pepper to the “death bin”! Gun Jack shoots Thay in the heart, and…only one man REMAINS:<br>SWEEP!!!<br>With a Solo Mission, the Comms. Officer kills Gun Jack, then sends Bryan Fury flying to the sky; in the meantime, Bruce Irvin scavenges Sweep’s gun and starts to rush! Sweep acts quickly and stomps Bryan Fury to his death. Bruce Irvin shoots and misses; and in return, the Comms. Officer punches him!<br>Another Solo Mission appears, and Sweep is left free to pound Bruce Irvin to death…then he runs towards Jin Kazama…and he rolls into the ground to dodge a lethal shotgun barrel! Then the punching and reloading…<br>AND I’m out of breath! For the second time, SWEEP dodges it AGAIN!!!<br>The Solo Mission appears for the third TIME…and after six punches…Jin Kazama says goodbye to life…<br>Restless gets activated…the Doctor appears and shoots him with a toxic shell!!!<br>WHO will win??<br>A high-damage punch from the Comms.Officer ends the Doctor’s short stay…<br>AND IT’S a Great Game FOR TEAM JAY!!!<br>POST VIEW:<br>Man of the Match: Sweep deserves a standing ovation for this match!<br>Flop of the Match: That uselsess action by Shaarpshoota (i.e. that walky-talky) was a turning point in the game.<br>Breaking Point: I guess there’s no need to say that THREE Solo Missions and the Restless from Sweep decided the game.<br>FINAL NOTES:<br>Superb execution by both armies, excellent match, and totally fun!<br>Nothing much to say.<br>8.5/10!!!</p><p>This is &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams happily signing off!!! Bye!!! <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":tid_lol:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":tid_lol:" class="tid_ico"><img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":tid_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>REPLAY IN WORDS#6<br>Good day guys!<br>This is &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams casting this week’s replay between SilentPinoy and Dime! Actually, it’s a pretty old match…<br>LINEUPS:<br>SilentPinoy (Left side, Blue):<br>Fighter, Comms.Officer 11<br>Ranger, Comms.Officer 11<br>Rogue, Spy 10<br>Wizard, Spy 10<br>Cleric, Doctor 10<br>Monk, Comms. Officer 11<br>Paladin, Spy 10<br>Bard, Munitions 10<br>Barbarian, Munitions 10<br>Sorcerer, Doctor 11<br>DIME (Right side, Red):<br>Armor King (Soldier 10)<br>Bryan Fury (Comms. Officer 11)<br>Marshall Law (Saboteur 12)<br>Raven (Munitions 11)<br>Paul Pheonix (Saboteur 11)<br>Jin Kazama (Saboteur 11)<br>Gun Jack (Soldier 11)<br>Bruce Irvin (Munitions 10)<br>Eddy Gordo (Doctor 12)<br>PREVIEW:<br>From last week’s Replay in Words, we have seen what kind of strategies they could have on the field already.<br>So instead, let’s focus on who will bring the goods for them:<br>The BLUE SIDE will obviously rely on its spy-heavy trio, Paladin, Rogue, and the ever-dangerous Wizard to deliver the goods, while the RED SIDE will rely on practically EVERYONE on the team to take the game for him!<br>So…who will win? Will SilentPinoy and James Bond take the game? Or will it be Dime’s “integrated strategy” that will decide the match?<br>Let’s find out together!<br>FIRST WAVE:<br>SilentPinoy: Fighter, Wizard, Bard, Cleric<br>Dime: Bruce Irvin, Raven, Marshall Law<br>Dime has appeared this time with a helicopter!!! However, Wizard takes the Twinoid again, and he starts wreaking havoc at the helo! Meanwhile, Marshall Law has placed a well-time shot, killing Fighter and inflicting mortal damnation to Bard in the process.<br>Raven takes the Twinoid afterwards; he gives Bard his passport to another dimension, and he throws a Frag Grenade, inflicting quite a large amount of damage to Cleric! Afterwards, he shoots Wizard, and the Red doctor uses Savior to send back Fighter to this dimension! Cleric goes back to the battlefield to lob a Frag Grenade, hitting the enemy side in the process. Meanwhile, the helicopter starts to shoot, and lo and behold! Cleric rolls into the ground and survives!<br>However, Bruce Irvin kills the doctor with a second salvo from his Apache Cannon, and Raven also shoots Wizard…it is as if these two people have their personal debts to settle! However, before Raven could give him another bullet in the torso, Wizard runs away from the field!<br>SECOND WAVE:<br>SilentPinoy: Ranger, Barbarian<br>Obviously, this is the result of a Reverse Attack inflicted by Dime…but Ranger takes out a walky-talky, calling Sorcerer in to even the odds a bit! Ranger takes the helicopter with one salvo from his M16 rifle, and Bruce Irvin dies from the fall…<br>Sorcere and Ranger rush in, while Barbarian gives the other side a warm Shock Grenade, causing Marshall Law to drop his weapon…Sorcerer almost kills Marshall Law, while the ever-troublesome Raven gives Ranger a headshot…<br>Then Barbarian shoots his Infernal Tube and misses! Raven shoots the Red doctor, and the latter charged towards Marshall Law and kills him…then disposes of Raven immediately afterwards!<br>Silent Pinoy: Rogue, Ranger (survivor)<br>Dime: Paul Phoenix, Armor King, Bryan Fury<br>Rogue wreaks havoc as usual, killing Armor King and Sorcerer in the process…then he sends Bryan Fury to the next life…then Paul Phoenix uses Crybaby…and calls in Paladin along with his three remaining allies: Eddy Gordo, Gun Jack, and Jin Kazama!<br>Gun Jack starts to stab Paladin to death, and the poor spy went six feet down afterwards…Rogue followed him, and Ranger went down for the second time…all thanks to Eddy Gordo! Then he takes the Twinoid, and while Barbarian dodged the shot, Gun Jack took the Twinoid and scavenged the Blue munitions’ sniper rifle!<br>After a couple of shots…he too drops down to the ground…<br>FINAL WAVE: Wizard, Fighter, Monk<br>Wizard comes in his second incarnation and kills Eddy Gordo with one shot! Afterwards, he takes his trademark Twinoid and all three of them gun down Paul Phoenix to death…then lots of Tuck n’Rolls are seen around…lots of shots too…and Monk sends Jin Kazama flying toward Death’s cold hands! Gun Jack avenges his teammate by killing Monk, and with only one explosive shell, Fighter takes the Red soldiers life…<br>And it’s GG!<br>MAN OF THE MATCH: Wizard<br>FLOP OF THE MATCH: Bruce Irvin<br>BREAKING POINT: When Ranger takes out the helo<br>MATCH NOTES: 8/10<br>Lots of action…<br>Anyways, I’m in a rush..see you guys!!!</p>

                <p>REPLAY IN WORDS#7<br><a href="http://pedped.minitroopers.com/b/fview/11079899" target="_blank">http://pedped.minitroopers.com/b/fvie...</a><br>Hey guys!<br>This is &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams signing in for another replay cast! Last time, we’ve seen SilentPinoy take on Dime in a very action-packed match!<br>Today, we’re gonna see two players: pedped and nazi2011. While we know pedped from Kill League D, nazi2011 is practically a ghost in this forum…unless I’m mistaken!<br>We’re gonna go to the lineups this time, since this will be their maiden replay:<br>pedped: (Yellow, left side) PR 97<br>Burtoff (Munitions 9 )<br>Broberg (Soldier 8 )<br>McMelo (Doctor 8 )<br>Melotor (Melotor 9 )<br>Jazilone (Doctor 7 )<br>Andertt (Soldier 8 )<br>MaxMelach (Soldier 9 )<br>Maxeed (Comms. Officer 7 )<br>nazi2011: (Orange right side) PR 97<br>Jigglyjagoof (Pilot 15 )<br>Nig (Pilot 9 )<br>BLKPOWR (Comms.Officer 9 )<br>SOFAKNGSTPID (Doctor 9 )<br>Boo Yah (Spy 9 )<br>No Match! (Doctor 9 )<br>Killwhitey! (Spy 9 )<br>PREVIEW:<br>1. Common Loadout:<br>Left side: Heat sensors, Grenades, Shells, Armor, Twinoid, Barrel extension<br>Right side: Walky-talky, Thermos, Twinoid, Amphetamine, Grenades, Shells, Rucksack, First aid<br>2. Strategic Viewpoint:<br>Based on their weapons and loadout, it seems that pedped’s gonna go for an integrated style of play, which means that each wave from his army can go for the extra mile. nazi2001, on the other hand, relies on a spy-heavy build despite his lack of numbers; in addition, he uses the time-tested launcher strat to wipe out his enemies.<br>There’s one note though: If one faces an integrated style of play, then the only thing that one can do is to pray that the preset strategies work. Because if they don’t…they it will be GG for the one who has run out of cards to play!<br>3. Men to Watch:<br>I’m gonna watch out for Burtoff and Maxeed for the left side, and Jigglyjagoff and No Match! for the right side.<br>Since pedped does not carry any machine guns or launchers, he should rely on some other form of firepower to carry the game.<br>On the other hand, since nazi2011’s spies and launchers will be busy, someone must carry the gme for him all along the road.<br>4. Other things to say:<br>Let’s watch the replay!!!<br>MATCH VIEW:<br>1st Wave:<br>Yellow side: Burtoff, McMelo, MaxMelamack<br>Orange side: Nig, No Match!, Jigglyjagoff, BLKPOWR, Boo Yah<br>The battle starts with a Rush from MaxMelack, and he quickly sends the spy away to the fifth dimension with one torso-shot! Jigglyjagoff throws a poison grenade, hitting Burtoff and MaxMelack. Nig takes the Twinoid quickly afterwards, and he fires his Infernal Tube and misses! Meanwhile, Jigglyjagoff and BLKPOWR sell the two poisoned guys to the vultures with a sniper shot and a launcher hit, respectively. <br>BLKPOWR gets his Solo Mission up, shoots McMelo, fires a GG Grende at him, and Jigglyjagoff dispatches him off to the hands of Death! <br>2nd Wave:<br>Pedped: Melotor, Andertt, Broberg<br>nazi2011: Killwhitey!<br>The Orange side’s spy quickly created a mess; after a few moments, poor Broberg is shot in the heart, while Melotor lobs a Frag Grenade towards the enemy side, hitting only No Match!<br>Jigglyjagoff kills the grenade-thrower afterwards, and then he gets a Solo Mission and starts to shoot Andertt in the face! After using a lot of ammo, the soldier finally goes down.<br>3rd Wave:<br>Maxeed, Jazilone<br>The killer pilot calls backup from a Walky-Talky, and SOFAKNGSTPID comes into view!<br>Just after going into the fray, the action started to heat up with BLKPOWR throwing Frag tht causes the death of his teammate, Killwhitey!<br>And then Maxeed takes the Twinoid after being healed by the doctor and starts to clean nazi2011’s army like trash! He throws a poison grenade, gets a Solo Mission in, and in the meantime, No Match! Kills Jazilone…it’s 1v3!!!<br>No Match! gives SOFAKNGSTPID an amphetamine shot, but it was totally useless. By then it was GG for the Orange side, and pedped takes the game!<br>POSTVIEW:<br>Man of the Match: Maxeed, for he did his job just as expected from him.<br>Flop of the Match: Boo Yah!, for doing zero impact on the game.<br>Breaking Point: When Nig missed that shot, he lost the chance to create a very large advantage for his team.<br>FINAL NOTES:<br>This just shows how strong an integrated strategy could be when done properly. Even the most feared strategies could be beaten using this tactic, and I hope that people will learn more and diversify their strategies!<br>By the way, there were no Saboteurs in this game, which is a welcome change of air, considering that a lot of armies tend to use Sabs in their armies…<br>So…I’m giving 8.5 out of 10 for this one!<br>Thanks for being here guys!<br>This is &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams, saying GL HF to all!!!</p>

                <p>REPLAY IN WORDS#8:<br>Hello everyone, this is &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams here once again for another “Replay In Words” talk!<br>Today, we’re gonna see together Team Jay against tratatalol (LINK: <a href="http://team-jay.minitroopers.com/b/fview/9680777" target="_blank">http://team-jay.minitroopers.com/b/fv...</a>) which is one of the deadliest dark horses around!<br>Who will win? Will the Undertaker take the game from Team Jay? Or will Team Jay be able to survive tratatalol’s deadly strikes and win it?<br>Let’s find out together!<br>LINEUPS:<br>Tratatalol: (Left side, Yellow)<br>Rogenser (Comms. Officer)<br>Yupp (Saboteur 10)<br>Lukenser (Spy 13)<br>Melito Khan (Munitions 10)<br>Jeffemiller (Pilot 13)<br>Kevater (Soldier 10)<br>Team Jay: (Right side,Green)<br>Ol’ Painless (Scout 9)<br>Boomstick (Pilot 10)<br>Newbie (Saboteur 9)<br>Boggy B (Soldier 9)<br>Shaarpshoota (Pilot 10)<br>Penfold (Munitions 10)<br>Cnut (Soldier 10)<br>Sweep (Comms. Officer 10)<br>Pepper (Saboteur 9)<br>Thay (Munitions 9)<br>Slig (Doctor 9)<br>NOTES: <br>*These levels are at the time of the battle.<br>**He has a 12th trooper, but it will not be included again here (it would be misleading to the readers).<br>PREVIEW:<br>1. Common Loadout:<br>Left side: Shells and Grenades, minimum Twinoid and other stuff<br>Right side: Binoculars, Armor, Grenades, Shells, Walky-talky, First Aid, Healing Grenade<br>2. Strategic Analysis:<br>It is well known already from previous casts how Team Jay wants to play his game, son o new surprises to be expected from him!<br>tratatalol, on the other hand, seems to rely on a pin-down strategy; it is apparent that he’s gonna use motorcycles or some other form of rush to put his enemy into a tight space, where his grenades and Shotguns+Exploding Shells would take care of the job. The spy would also do the same job for him…<br>Whoever owns tratatalol is not known as of this moment here in the forums…MYSTERIOUS!<br>3. Men to Watch:<br>tratatalol will rely on his heavily-leveled pilot and spy to bring the goods for him, while Team Jay will rely on every single wave to get through this nightmare!<br>WHO is the MAN? WHo will come out on TOP? Let’s find out together!<br>MATCH VIEW:<br>1st Wave: <br>tratatalol: Melito Khan, Yupp, Kevater, Jeffmiller<br>Team Jay: Newbie, Sharpshoota, Boomstick, Penfold, Ol’ Painless<br>Jeffmiller appears on the field with a motorcycle…and kills Ol’ Painless, Penfold, and Sharpshoota with two shots, as well as inflicting a high amount of damage to Newbie and Boomstick! The green pilot Scavenges the rapier of Death, but is soon killed afterwards by Jeffmiller’s friends.<br>Very short story!<br>2nd Wave:<br>Team Jay: Boggy B, Pepper, Cnut (Lukenser as spy for tratatalol)<br>Boggy B starts by Charging the Pilot and making him a martyr…Lukenser fires his shotgun, hitting Pepper and killing Cnut…Boggy B also ends his trouble making-activities…and they start to advance!<br>Kevater takes a Twinoid, and kills Boggy B with one clip from his assault rifle! Afterwards, he proceeds to kill Pepper, and his friends complete the job…<br>FINAL WAVE: Slig, Thay, Sweep<br>Thay begins by trying to send the Yellow soldier to the grave; but he fails to do so, and Sweep finishes Kevater off! Meanwhile, Yupp misses…and Melito Khan fires a grenade, causing damage to Slig and Sweep! Meanwhile, Thay fires and misses too…and Melito Khan focuses him down, but is saved by a SPLIT-SECOND Healing Grenade by Slig! He cures Sweep of his poison, and starts on a solo mission, taking Melito Khan down in three shots! Then he kills Yupp with only one shot…and Slig kills poor Rogenser just upon entering the field!<br>GG and well-played (WP) for tratatalol!<br>Team Jay gets the game.<br>POST VIEW:<br>Man Of The Match: Slig, for taking down half of tratatalol’s army and saving his teammate’s life.<br>Flop of the Match: Yupp could have won the match there. But after he missed that Infernal Tube shot, tratatalol lost a very great advantage.<br>Breaking Point: When that rocket shot by Yupp went way off mark…<br>OTHER NOTES:<br>Team Jay should have been really happy over that win…tratatalol has just almost WIPED his army out!<br>To be honest, tratatalol has a future. If he continues like this…then he will have one of the most powerful armies in Minitroopers!<br>This was a totally fun replay!!<br>FINAL SCORE: 8.5/10. Gut-wrenching match!<br><br>This is once again &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams signing off! Have a good day everyone!</p>

                <p>REPLAY IN WORDS#9<br>Ladies and gentlemen, a good day to you all!<br>This is &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams here today with you, and we will see together another epic battle!<br>Last time, it was Team Jay and tratatalol...Epic war!<br>This time around, we’re gonna watch Dawnblade vs. Doomsday Brigade!(WANT TO WATCH IT? <a href="http://dawnblade.minitroopers.com/b/fview/11163227" target="_blank">http://dawnblade.minitroopers.com/b/f...</a>)<br>Doomsday Brigade is well-known for being the “gatekeeper” in the Continuous Championship...while Dawnblade is renowned for his explosive style of fighting!<br>Who will win? Will the Gatekeeper win bar Dawnblade from completing his quest? Or will Dawnblade be able to break through the odds?<br>Let’s find out together! Here are the lineups:<br>Dawnblade: (GREEN, LEFT)<br>Samield (Comms. Officer 9)<br>Mooney Brow (Soldier 9)<br>Hulkey (Munitions 9)<br>Ederg Hunter (Pilot 9)<br>Mool (Comms. Officer 9)<br>Orlaley Jr (Soldier 9)<br>Melando (Soldier 9)<br>Joni Hunter (Comms. Officer 8 )<br>Doomsday Brigade: (VIOLET, RIGHT)<br>Joneiber (Scout 8 )<br>Chriney Jr (Doctor 8 )<br>Rickunoff (Saboteur 8 )<br>Samiws (Comms. Officer 8 )<br>Georgers (Comms. Officer 8 )<br>Smitheves (Munitions 8 )<br>Jopp (Saboteur 8 )<br>Don Samukins (Soldier 8 )<br>Jazimes (Munitions 8 )<br>Meleves (Pilot 8 )<br>Rogenser(Medic 8 )<br>PREVIEW:<br>As I’ve said in the previous casts, Dawnblade’s style is pretty explosive and effective against armies who like to mass on the field. Apparently, he’s not gonna face spies on the field, so that will make his life much easier…It will all depend on how he executes his strategy!<br>Doomsday Brigade, on the other hand, focuses on a skill-heavy army, with lots of Loaders and Armor on his team…and he relies on a very heavy-weapons based strategy! Only Samiws and Meleves don’t carry big guns…<br>MEN TO WATCH:<br>Apparently, I’m gonna put my bets on Melando and Don Samukins to bring the goods for either side. I guess it’s gonna be an explosive match!<br>Army-wise, Comms. Officers and Saboteurs will be an important part of the Gatekeeper’s strategy; that goes for Dawnblade too! If the Comms. Officers fail to provide him…then it’s gonna be an easy day for Doomsday Brigade!<br>FINAL WORDS:<br>One…two…and three! Fight!<br>MATCH VIEW:<br>1st Wave:<br>Left: Orlaley Jr, Mooney Brown, Mooll, Hulkey<br>Right: Don Samukins, Georgers, Meleves, Jopp, Smitheves<br>OH MY GOD!!! Hahaha!<br>The action starts with people rolling…and a Glue Grenade that hits four of the Gatekeeper’s guys! Whew! Everyone…I mean everyone starts shooting, and Orlaley Jr kills Meleves with a headshot! Meanwhile, Smitheves fires and misses!<br>Mooney Brown lobs a frag…Don Samukins fires and misses! Mooll gets a solo mission, runs, and Jopp sends the fragger to the grave!<br>Don Samukins takes the Twinoid…and almost kills Mooll! Hulkey did some effort with that Covering Fire before that…and finally, the Twinoid-packed Soldier kills Mooll…Hulkey avenges his teammate…everyone runs toward each other…and the Rush from Smitheves misses…then Orlaley Jr fires a poison-tipped barrel!<br>Jopp and Hulkey start to settle their debts…and Smitheves dies from the poison shot! Another shot from Orlaley Jr ends the first wave!<br>2nd Wave:<br>Violet: Joneiber, Rickunoff, Samiws, Chriney Jr, Jazimes, Smitheves (survivor)<br>The pack starts to get hot-wired…and everyone just wants to kill poor Orlaley Jr! After some time, Jazimes sends both Smitheves and Orlaley to Death’s hands…All this time, Hulkey was dodging every shot that the Doomsday Brigade sends!<br>Then Hulkey makes Rickunoff kiss the face of the earth in a gunfight…gets a solo mission and almost kills Samiws! Chriney Jr sends him six feet down the edge…<br>That was the end of the wave for the Green Side!<br>FINAL WAVE:<br>Samield, Joni Hunter, Ederg Hunter, Melando<br>The firing goes non-stop…and Ederg Hunter almost kills Samiws for the second time! The doctor was also heavily struck…and Joni Hunter ends Samiws’ long life…Samield follows up with a headshot…and Joneiber goes to the next dimension!<br>Ederg Hunter takes the Solo Mission and tries to take Jazimes’ life…In return, he retaliates with an Infernal Tube shot that missed! The violet pilot answered with another well-placed shot and finally gets rid of him for good!<br>Samield gives the poor doctor a shot in the heart…and Rogenser tried to make amends by making Samield and Ederg Hunter fly to their deaths! However, a well-placed Solo Mission and rocket ends Doomsday Brigade’s hopes…and Dawnblade takes the game!<br>POST MATCH:<br>Man of the Match: Orlaley Jr secured that window of opportunity for Dawnblade to take the game.<br>Flop of the Match: Despite taking the Twinoid, Don Samukins failed to deliver a lot on the table…it might just have decided the game!<br>Breaking Point: When Rogenser fired that killer rocket and fails to take down Melando!<br>FINAL NOTES:<br>8.5/10. Too much action…I could not keep up with the pace of the game!</p><p>Hope to see you again guys! Bye!</p>

                <p>REPLAY IN WORDS#10<br>A good day to all!<br>This is your very own Lost In Dreams, and I’m about to cast this replay from Team Jay (who, by the way, submits very wonderful replays!)<br>HERE’s the link for those who want to watch it: <a href="http://team-jay.minitroopers.com/b/fview/11350109" target="_blank">http://team-jay.minitroopers.com/b/fv...</a><br>So, what are we waiting for? Here are the rosters:<br>PAUSE: (Left side, Violet)<br>Harrill, Munitions 11<br>Russe, Spy 10<br>Melield, Comms. Officer 13<br>Smithers, Pilot 12<br>Lukotor, Soldier 8<br>Goldill, Soldier 9<br>Jeffenser, Pilot 9<br>Edall, Pilot 8<br>MaxRogium, Soldier 9<br>TEAM JAY: (Right side, Green)<br>Ol’ Painless, Scout 9<br>Boomstick, Pilot 11<br>Newbie, Saboteur 9<br>Boggy B, Soldier 9<br>Shaarpshoota, Pilot 10<br>Penfold, Munitions 10<br>Cnut, Soldier 10<br>Sweep, Comms. Officer 10<br>Pepper, Saboteur 9<br>Thay, Munitions 10<br>Slig, Doctor 9<br>Shikari, Spy 10<br>PRE-MATCH ANALYSIS:<br>Since I have pointed out in previous sections how Team Jay and his troopers play, let’s go quickly to Pause’s equipment, troop composition, and expected strategies!<br>1. EQUIPMENT:<br>Shells, Barrel Extensions, Grenades, Rucksack, Loader, Laser Sights, Armor, Thermos<br>2. TROOP COMPOSITION:<br>It is clear that he wants to survive through the so-called “execution stage” (the stage after most of the action and strategies have been done) from this Soldier-heavy lineup. On the other hand, he want a “contain” (evidenced by the existence of a spy) and “buff” (Munitions and Comms. Officer), respectively.<br>3. EXPECTED STRATEGIES:<br>He will try to fight and engage his enemy at all ranges with all kinds of weapons and strategies possible. It will be only a matter of organization and luck!<br>So what are we waiting for? Let’s rock and load guys!<br>MATCH VIEW:<br>WAVE 1:<br>Violet Side: MaxRogill, Smithers, Harill<br>Green Side: Shikari, Boomstick, Shaarpshoota, Pepper, Newbie, Penfold<br>Boomstick quickly begins with a Poison Grenade, and Sharpshoota takes the first blood by killing Harill! Meanwhile, Shikari tastes the power of the Faceboot, and Smithers dispatches him with a slow salvo from his HMG afterwards. Shaarpshoota and Boomstick work together to take down Smithers, and after a few moments, he sees the Angel of Death taking his soul violently! Meanwhile, Penfold rushes and Shaarpshoota uses the cursed Walky-Talky once again! Boggy B comes into the field, and then they start taking care of MaxRoguim, who died after receiving a combination of Solo Mission, gunfire, and poison!<br>WAVE 2:<br>Violet Side: Lukotor, Goldill, Edall, Jeffenser<br>Jeffenser quickly avenges his teammates by making both Penfold and Boggy B kiss the face of the earth, with the former unable to rise again! Lukotor uses a Gas Grenade and hits both Boomstick and Newbie; Goldill has killed Pepper with one powerful charge! But he does not stop there; he kills Newbie in the same manner, and dispatches Boomstick afterwards! It seems that he’s going on a rampage, and Boggy B dies from a slow salvo…all thanks to the Violet charger! Shaarpshoota uses CryBaby to call for help, and that will be the second wave for Team Jay. The question: Will they be able to stop Goldill’s rampage?<br>WAVE 2: Thay, Ol’Painless, Slig, Sweep, Shaarpshoota (Cry Baby)</p><p>Just as Team Jay’s forces enter the field, Goldill gives them a very warm welcome: Thay goes to the hands of Death thanks to the violet charger’s explosive shells! However, Ol’Painless puts a timely end to it…and everyone just starts advancing like hell!<br>Sweep takes down Edall in a gunfight, while Ol’Painless uses Binoculars to spot Russe and bring him into the field, and Sweep goes six feet down thanks to a stream of fire from Lukotor! Meanwhile, both sides exchange shots, and Jeffenser gets a Solo Mission, using it to make Slig fly back towards the other side of the field! Then Russe kills Ol’Painless with a HMG, and just as Slig stands up, he is made to lie down forever by the advancing troops of Pause. Shaarpshoota takes down Lukotor with a single shot, and then Jeffenser gets another Solo Mission and lobs a frag grenade, then starts to chase the Green sniper; and after a little while, Russe and Jeffenser manage to kill him together!<br>FINAL WAVE: Cnut, Sweep (Survivor)<br>Cnut welcomes Jeffenser with a withering rain of bullets, but he dodges them all! Jeffenser gets a Solo Mission and starts to punch…then Cnut gives him again a load of fire, only for the Green pilot to dodge it once more! Meanwhile, Sweep shoots Russe in the back, and then the machine gunner fires back…though brave Sweep dodged it, he has finally succumbed to the poison, and Cnut was all that was left…Jeffenser dodges Cnut’s attacks for the third time, and after a few moments…it was GG!<br>POST MATCH:<br>This is one of the hardest replays that I have ever casted so far…it was hard for me to decide the Man of the Match, the Flop of the Match, and the Breaking Point in this game…<br>So here they are:<br>Man of the Match: It is really tempting to give Goldill the title, but I decided to give it to Jeffenser for two reasons:<br>1. He opened up the gate for Goldill to do that rampage (remember that Penfold and Boggy B were in position to take down that wave?)<br>2. He really worked hard to clean up the last wave (it is very obvious from the replay…)<br>NOTE: However, Goldill should be also given credit for the rampage that he has done…<br>Flop of the Match: Boggy B did not do anything. Enough said.<br>NOTE: Cnut was also a close candidate for this one…<br>Breaking Point: Goldill’s rampage was the breaking point in that game. Team Jay lost a great chance to break down Pause’s army afterwards!<br>SCORE: 9/10. Lots of individual action, team fights, and superb execution from both sides! Not to mention that the battle was down to the wire, and that the winner of the match was not clear until the last second of the game!!!</p><p>Guys, I need to go to class now...I'm late! Hope to see you again! Whew!</p>

                <p>REPLAY IN WORDS#11<br>Good day!<br>This is &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams here once again for another episode of Replay In Words!<br>Today, we’re gonna have an explosive match between Dawnblade and Depress!<br>Here’s the link for those who would like to watch it on their own:<br><a href="http://dawnblade.minitroopers.com/b/fview/11482695" target="_blank">http://dawnblade.minitroopers.com/b/f...</a><br>So, what are we waiting for? Let’s go to the lineups!<br>DAWNBLADE:<br>Samield (Comms. Officer 9)<br>Mooney Brow (Soldier 9)<br>Hulkey (Munitions 9)<br>Ederg Hunter (Pilot 9)<br>Mool (Comms. Officer 9)<br>Orlaley Jr (Soldier 9)<br>Melando (Soldier 9)<br>Joni Hunter (Comms. Officer 9)<br>DEPRESS:<br>Depress (Soldier 9)<br>Hemingway (Munitions 9)<br>Tentackle (Comms. Officer 9)<br>Diablo (Doctor 9)<br>Kick-Ass (Scout 9)<br>Big Daddy (Comms. Officer 9)<br>Ripper (Soldier 9)<br>standa (Soldier 9)<br>Smith (Soldier 9)<br>UgandaPWN (Soldier 9)<br>SoulEater (Pilot 9)<br>PRE-MATCH ANALYSIS:<br>Dawnblade:// He’s gonna go for the “AR+launcher+grenade” strategy once again. This strategy is proven to be effective against tightly-packed units…including friendlies!<br>I have already pointed out the rest of Dawnblade’s tactics, though I may add that the addition of a Comms. Officer to his ranks will help him in doing a lot of damage!<br>Depress:// Equipped with all sorts of equipment (and without any launchers), this army’s just one hell of a classical “commando squad”. Apparently, he’s gonna try to engage his enemy at all ranges…but there’s a problem: He’s got a Scout, which means he’s gonna just be fair game to the opposing army’s strategy!<br>The question: Will his soldiers be able to withstand the “frag rain” and get a classical Russian charge to win the game? Or will Dawnblade’s explosives prove too much for him?<br>Let’s find out together!<br>MATCH VIEW:<br>Wave 1:<br>Left Side: Orlaley Jr, Mooney Brown, Melando, Hulkey<br>Right Side: Depress, SoulEater, UgandaPWN, standa, Smith, Ripper<br>The action starts too quickly…both sides start shooting at each other…Hulkey uses Covering Fire…Melando takes the Twinoid…and makes standa fly to Heaven with one launcher shot! Mooney Brown lobs a grenade that hits almost everyone on the other side! Meanwhile, Depress kills Hulkey, and Orlaley lobs the hated GG Grenade, hitting a lot of people on Depress’ army! He should be so depressed right now…Orlaley Jr fires a barrel, and kills whoever goes on his path!<br>Mooney Brown takes the Solo Mission and throws a frag, kills UgandaPWN, and loads his gun…both squads advance and Ripper shoots a nonsensical frag…Mooney Brown kills the fragger and Orlaley Jr fires a poison-tipped barrel! Depress gets a Solo Mission and almost kills Orlaley Jr…then changes to a pistol to kill him! Mooney Brown kills Depress finally, and the second wave comes…<br>Final Wave: Tentackle, Kick-Ass, Hemingway, Big Daddy, Diablo<br>The second wave cleans the remnants of Dawnblade’s army…<br>Final Wave: Ederg Hunter, Mooll, Samield, Joni Hunter<br>Ederg Hunter fires and misses…then he fires again, hitting a great part of Depress’ tightly-packed squad! Then Mooll fires and kills the poor doctor on the other side…Samield throws a grenade…then Tentackle goes on a Solo Mission, killing Ederg Hunter and injuring Samield! Joni Hunter changes into a HMG and kills Hemingway…and by then it was over…<br>GG?! Loled at the game!<br>POST MATCH:<br>Man of the Match: Mooney Brown maintained a presence throughout the early and middle stages of the game, and did a great job while standing on the field!<br>Flop of the Match: Goes to the poor Doctor. LOL!<br>Breaking Point: When Orlaley threw that GG Grenade, he provided the ground for the rest of his team to take out that wave…<br>OTHER NOTES:<br>This game exactly shows the characteristics of “centralized strategy”; they only function until the end of the execution stage. Depress’ second wave just cleaned up everyone like no problem; this should serve as a reminder for the ones using this line of battle to think carefully on how they execute it inside the game.<br>Going to the match, it was explosive (expecting it from Dawnblade), and well-played, though I wished that I had seen more of Depress’ play.<br>FINAL VERDICT: 8/10<br>Signing out…Bye!</p>

                <p>REPLAY IN WORDS: REVENGE MATCH<br>Hi guys, this is your very own &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams, and today I’m gonna skip the lineups and the preview…for this is practically a match against Pause and Team Jay!<br>THE REVENGE MATCH IS HERE: <a href="http://team-jay.minitroopers.com/b/fview/11051811" target="_blank">http://team-jay.minitroopers.com/b/fv...</a><br>Will Team Jay defend it well this time? Or will Pause’s rage get the game for him?<br>Let’s get it on!<br>MATCH CAST:<br>1st Wave:<br>Pause: Edall, Smithers, Jeffenser, MaxRogium<br>Team Jay: Pepper, Shaarpshoota, Boomstick, Newbie, Penfold<br>Both sides start with the rush…but Team Jay takes the extra mile ahead! Boomstick begins with a poison grenade, then Shaarpshoota uses the cursed Walky-Talky, Boggy B comes in…and the shooting begins! Pause takes the first shot, and Pepper rolls into the ground! Boggy B charges and kills Edall! Smithers kills Boggy B…but a shot from Shaarpshoota makes the Violet pilot drop his HMG! And here come the rocket from Boomstick…and it kills Smithers! Everybody’s just avenging somebody!!!<br>MaxRogium sends Pepper six feet down; people are just shooting each other like hell…MaxRogium kills Penfold…and the action…I can’t see who’s killing who!<br>Boomstick just scavenges Jeffenser’s shotgun from a long distance…and after intense fire from both sides, Shaarpshoota finishes MaxRogium off! Jeffenser gets that Solo Mission, and he kills Boomstick…then it seems the action has just decreased in intensity…everybody’s reloading something!<br>Jeffenser was the one to finish first…and he disposes of Newbie in great style! Shaarpshoota just cries like a 6-month old baby…and that’s the 2nd wave for team Jay!<br>2nd Wave: Thay, Sweep, Ol’Painless; Russe (spy)<br>Thay quickly reacts by shooting the Violet spy; he returns the welcome with a stream of poison shells! Ol’Painless uses his binoculars…and lo and behold! It’s Shikari! Russe sends another scatter of bullets…only to have Sweep finish him off with a deadly barrel!<br>Ol’Painless uses his binos for the second time, and Goldill comes out! Meanwhile, Shaarpshoota kills Jeffenser with a poison shell…and Sweep rushes in! However, Shaarpshoota and Sweep both die from the poison…and Shikari shoots Goldill…but the coward retreats!<br>Final Wave: Goldill, Melield, Lukotor, Harrill<br>The coward soldier returns with his friends this time…for revenge! Lukotor mows Sweep into the hands of Death, while Goldill does a great job this time by charging and killing Ol’Painless! Shikari just stood there to die…<br>Final Wave: Cnut, Slig<br>It’s 4v2!Cnut kills Goldill, takes down Harrill, wipes out Melield from the face of the earth, and…what? He kills Lukotor! Ultra kill!<br>GG WP for Team Jay in this fast-paced match!<br>MATCH REVIEW:<br>9/10 for this wonderful match!<br>Man of the Match: Almost EVERYONE from Team Jay’s team deserved this title, but I believe that this time it should be given to Shaarpshoota, the cursed walky-talky and crybaby guy! REASON? He maintained a presence in the game, assisted his team on many occasions, and even killed some enemies!<br>Flop of the Match: Edall? Zero impact on the game. Not unlike his deadly brethren.<br>Breaking Point: When Jeffenser was unable to rush into the enemy ranks, Pause lost a chance to initiate the momentum of the game!<br>Too much action from both sides!<br>See you guys!!! Thanks for watching!</p>

                <p>EPLAY IN WORDS: MAY MELEE<br>Hi guys, this is your very own Lost In Dreams, and I’m here today after a 5-day hiatus to cast this wonderful replay from the May Melee!<br>The May Melee is where the big boys blast it out, and today, I’m gonna show this replay, where the Swarm goes against the Commando! Will the Russian horde win? Or will the Philippine-style guerillas take the day?<br>If you still don’t know what I’m talking about, here’s the replay: <br><a href="http://smithz.minitroopers.com/b/fview/11567773" target="_blank">http://smithz.minitroopers.com/b/fvie...</a><br>And…let’s start with the lineups!<br>smithz:<br>Baby Rocket (Comms 7 )<br>Mclaine (Sab 7 )<br>Two Gun Kid (Sab 8 )<br>Bullseye (Comms 7)<br>Predator (Sab 7 )<br>Sgt. Rock (Soldier 8 )<br>Toxico (Comms 7 )<br>Sniper X (Comms 7 )<br>Sitting Duck (Pilot 7 )<br>Moncappy’s Legions:<br>Harreley (Munitions 11 )<br>Maxold (Sab 10 )<br>Rogones (Spy 10 )<br>Kevie (Comms 10 )<br>Edimes (Soldier 10 )<br>Malcolm (Spy 10 )<br>Broberg (Scout 10 )<br>Maxiwen-X (Munitions 10 )<br>Jazito (Spy 11 )<br>Maxater (Sab 11 )<br>McJeffoff (Scout 11 )<br>PRE-GAME:<br>Equipment-wise, number-wise, and level-wise, the Russian horde carries an immense advantage over smithy’s side. However, it seems that the guerrilla guys will rely on their skills to get over the swarm, and launchers+shotguns would be a very good counter to this strategy, which he does not have…<br>The other side does not have launchers; it seems that he wants precise firepower at all ranges…and with the Voodoo Staff at his call, it seems that he’s gonna just steamroll his enemies…<br>Let’s watch the game!<br>MATCH VIEW:<br>1st Wave:<br>smithz: Two Gun Kid, Predator<br>Moncappy’s Legions: Harreley, Maxold, Rogones, Kevie, Edimes, Malcolm, Broberg, Maxiwen-X, Jazito<br>What the hell? Hahahaha!<br>Moncappy starts with his swarm, and Rogones starts with the first shot, damaging his enemy and killing his teammate! Then the spy kills Two Gun Kid, the army advances, and Harreley takes the Twinoid! He throws a grenade and kills Predator afterwards.<br>One wave down!<br>2nd Wave:<br>smithz: Bullseye, Baby Rocket, Sgt.Rock, Sniper-X<br>Bullseye starts with a Scavenge, kills both the spy and Sniper-X, while Sgt.Rock shoots at Edimes, and everyone’s focusing fire at him! Meanwhile, Baby Rocket’s projectile goes way off mark…and in the ensuing gunfire, Edimes goes to the next dimension…Kevie lobs a Poison Grenade…and Bullseye does the same thing! These people are just crazy!<br>Maxold also misses that rocket shot, and Harreley rushes to kill Bullseye, then Maniwen-X takes the Twinoid and makes smithz’s squad kiss the face of the earth!<br>Two waves down!<br>Final Wave:<br>smithz: Karlewis Lee, Mclaine, Toxico<br>Just as they enter the field, they start avenging their teammates! Broberg goes six feet down, Toxico sends Maxiwen-X to Death’s hands, Karlewis takes Harreley down, and Jazito shoots down Mclaine…Meanwhile, Kevie dies from the poison, and the firing continues…then Toxico gets a solo mission and rips Jazito’s soul off! Finally, Karlewis and Toxico work together to take out Maxold! One large wave has been wiped out! Whew!<br>Late Game:<br>Moncappy’s Legions: Maxater, McJeffoff<br>Maxaters calls a voodoo curse upon the brave troopers, but Toxico replies with a Solo Mission, killing the shaman! Meanwhile, McJeffoff kills the poor pilot, and it all comes down to the last man! Toxico gets a Solo Mission, guns McJeffoff down to 1 HP, and lo and behold! He gets a headshot!<br>What the heck???<br>GG WP for both sides!<br>FINAL NOTES:<br>Man of the Match: This is the most tricky part of the game…After viewing that replay for ten times, I decided to make Harreley and Maxiwen-X share the title!<br>Flop of the Match: Edimes did almost nothing there!<br>Breaking Point: When Baby Rocket missed that shot…It could have changed the course of the game!<br>SCORE: 8.5/10…Very entertaining, tricky, and crazy!<br>Guys, thanks for watching! See you again!<br>&lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams</p>

                <p>REPLAY IN WORDS#12<br>For those who want to watch it: <a href="http://team-jay.minitroopers.com/b/fview/12161202" target="_blank">http://team-jay.minitroopers.com/b/fv...</a><br>Ladies and gentlemen, this is your very own Lost In Dreams, writing on a dark cloudy spring afternoon!<br>Since it’s dark, let’s just watch a replay from Team Jay, who goes up against Zen Warrior in this match!<br>Obviously, everyone who is reading the commentary should have been familiar by now how Team Jay likes to play! But if you still want to know, refer to the previous Replay in Words sections!<br>Uhhh…so let’s go to the lineups…omitting Team Jay’s army, of course!<br>ZEN WARRIORS: (Red, Attacking Side)<br>Church, Comms. Officer 9<br>Campbell, Doctor 8<br>Hobbes, Dcotor 9<br>Nash, Comms. Officer 10<br>Holsten, Sab 10<br>Soldier, Soldier 11<br>Camber, Munitions 8<br>Gaskin, Soldier 9<br>Armitage, Comms. Officer 9<br>Kulusuk, Comms. Officer 8<br>PRE-MATCH SUMMARY:<br>Zero-launcher army, weapons of all kinds, hydroshock &amp; explosive shells: Zen Warriors will try to kill off the vital enemy troopers before they are able to execute their strategies. Once again, we see Dr.Twinoid, as well as grenades, loaders, armor, and a cursed Walky-Talky; this army is pretty strongly built.<br>However, judging from Team Jay’s general performance, one can safely say that he can get through this one…Unless he makes large-scale mistakes, of course!<br>So here’s what we are waiting for…Will the Red army get its Zen moment? Or will Team Jay prove once again his determination to wipe out his foes?<br>Here we go!<br>MATCH POST:<br>1st Wave:<br>Red Side: Gent, Gaskin, Kulusuk<br>Green Side: Shikari (spy), Ol’Painless, Shaarpshoota, Boomstick, Newbie, Penfold<br>Even as his friends get into the field, Shikari starts wreaking havoc with his shotgun! The action is too fast…the spy gets killed, and Boomstick strikes his enemies in revenge! Penfold rushes, and Ol’Painless uses his binoculars to scout Hobbes…Shaarpshoota uses again the cursed Walky-Talky, and he calls Thay in!<br>Gent kills Penfold and Boomstick scavenges Gent’s gun! Everyone vents their anger at Gent, and Ol’Painless gives him a passport out of this life! Boomstick gets a solo mission, and he throws a Shock Grenade…Ol’Painless uses the Binos again to scout Camber, and Newbie lobs a frag, hitting everyone except the doctor! Hobbes starts a mess by charging the scout…then he follows up by making Newbie kiss the ground! Boomstick throws a Poison Grenade...then Boomstick says goodbye to his comrades, thanks to a couple of HE shells, and the doctor stomps Newbie to death!<br>Thay shoots Camber in the heart, then the doctor heals Gaskin, and kills everyone with a stream of explosive shells except for Shaarpshoota, who is now crying for help…<br>2nd Wave A:<br>Pepper, Boggy B, Sweep<br>Pepper starts with peppering his foes with shotgun barrels, then the whole squad advances…and Sweep gives the last word for Hobbes!<br>2nd Wave B:<br>Holsten, Church, Armitage, Campbell<br>Everyone starts a shootout, and Holsten takes a Twinoid…then tries to kill Pepper with his fists! Then everyone on Team Jay’s side shoots at him, and when two Green troopers approached him, lo and behold! He commits hara-kiri!!!<br>LOL.<br>No one is killed, except for that suicide sab!<br>Church calls Nash in, and then they start shooting; everyone gets a Commando, and they send Sweep, Pepper and Boggy B in quick succession towards Death’s hands! Church throws a Poison Grenade that hits Shaarpshoota, and Nash shoots Slig in the lungs!<br>It’s just a matter of clean up for Zen Warriors, and the final wave (?) comes in the form of Cnut!<br>And what the heck? Cnut takes down everyone in a matter of seconds…Campbell, Armitage, Church, and Nash all go down!!!<br>Zen Warriors should be thinking…or pickupsticks should be saying to himself:<br>“WTF?”<br>Hahaha! That’s the end of the game!<br>POST-MATCH SUMMARY:<br>Man of the Match: Goes to both Boomstick &amp; Cnut; the former did a wonderful job at carrying the game, while the latter just amazed everyone with his performance!<br>Flop of the Match: I also have two people in: Camber and Holsten; they did not do anything good in the game!<br>Breaking Point: When Boomstick got that rocket shot against his foes…Team Jay got a small advantage that enabled him to get through the “execution stage”!<br>Score: 8/10!<br>GG WP!<br>This is &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams, signing off…Goodbye!</p>

                <p>REPLAY IN WORDS#13<br>Well, long time no see!<br>Hahaha! Hi guys, this is &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams here, taking a break from all those monstrous exams and projects that I need to do!<br>Seriously speaking, there were a lot of events in the last few days: server maintenance, server shutdown, May Melee, Scrap Metal, Kill League C, and so on and so forth!<br>It is very good to see an active community like this!<br>Anyways, let us go to the replay that Xtremewiki has submitted. Though it features two of his armies, it’s a special request, so let’s get to it!<br>REPLAY’S HERE: <a href="http://nightblade.minitroopers.com/b/fview/12418666" target="_blank">http://nightblade.minitroopers.com/b/...</a><br>So without further ado, let’s introduce Nightblade quickly!<br>Moonoff (Munitions 7)<br>Hulkamiller (Doctor <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"><br>Harri (Spy <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"><br>Don Harrapp (Comms <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"><br>Lukewis Lee (Scout <img src="../../../../gfx/square/cool.png" alt="8)" class="tid_ico"><br>If you wonder why in the world I DID NOT introduce Dawnblade, it’s pretty obvious that he does not need one!<br>PREVIEW:<br>This army is one hell of a lucky army! Very good equipment and weaponry at such an early stage of the game! It comes with a price though…this army must take out its enemies quickly; otherwise, its total combat effectiveness will be dampened…On the other hand, if this army is left to last for a long time on the field, it’s gonna be GG even for higher-leveled armies!<br>This army gonna face an enemy who will rely on grenades+explosives and a set of Comms.Officers to finish the game before it goes towards the “post-execution” stage…and Dawnblade is a proven veteran of the field!<br>Who will win? Will the time-proven soldiers of Dawnblade take it? Or will fresh blood under Nightblade get through the test?<br>Let’s find out!<br>GAME VIEW:<br>Wave 1:<br>NIGHTBLADE: Hulkamiller, Moonoff, Lukewis Lee, Don Harrapp<br>DAWNBLADE: Orlaley Jr, Mooney Brown, Melando, Hulkey<br>Hulkamiller takes the first shot, while Moonoff, lobs a frag grenade that hits 3 troops on the enemy side! Don Harrapp takes Hulkey down for a first blood! Moonoff throws a HE greande this time, but is intercepted by Orlaley Jr!<br>The real shooting begins here, and Melando has missed a long, long way off…Don Harrapp throws a green greande, Lukewis Lee kills Orlaley Jr, and Mooney Brown dodges everything that the yellow scout sends at him!<br>The two green cowards retreat and the 2nd wave starts for Dawnblade:<br>Wave 2: Mooll, Joni Hunter, Ederg Hunter, Harri (spy)<br>Harri takes the Twinoid and quickly starts wreaking hell on everyone in Dawnblade’s team! After a couple of seconds, he was able to send two of Dawnblade’s troops back to where they belong! Meanwhile, Joni Hunter takes down Lukewis Lee, and Moonoff quickjly avenges his friend’s death afterwards.<br>Wait. Did Dawnblade’s 2nd wave just said goodbye to this world?<br>Whatever! Let’s watch the last wave!<br>Wave 3: Samield, Melando, and Mooney Brown<br>Seems that Samield finally convinced his deserter friends to go back to the field to atone themselves…Mooney Brown gets a Solo Mission, throws a grenade, and honors his vow by killing Harri! Meanwhile, Samield misses another shot, and the yellow Comms. Officer shoots Mooney Brown in the heart! Finally, Hulkamiller gets a Rush, and Don Harrapp finishes him off...only one remained and then it was GG for NIGHTBLADE!<br>POSTVIEW:<br>Whew! That was an interesting game. It took only one wave for Nightblade to kill a larger army!<br>So, here are the guys!<br>Man of the Match: In an upset game like this, everyone deserves to be given the title. However, I decided to give Don Harrapp the title, for he took out vital enemy troopers that could have ended their bid.<br>Flop Of The Match: Samield ate up all his credits by missing two VITAL rocket shots. God bless him.<br>Breaking Point: When Harri appeared in the 2nd wave, it was only a matter of time before Dawnblade was beaten.<br>SCORE: 8/10. Very good replay overall!<br>So, I guess this I’m gonna sign out. Bye!</p>

                <p>REPLAY IN WORDS#14<br>Hi guys…this is &lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams, and I’m about to cast a replay between two of the strongest, if not the best, players on the English MT server!<br>Put up your bets!<br>It’s Caine vs. Nevermore! REP: <a href="http://caine.minitroopers.com/b/fview/12447556" target="_blank">http://caine.minitroopers.com/b/fview...</a><br>Let us not lose time, let’s go to the pre-game analysis!<br>PREVIEW:<br>To start with, Caine has a lot of Explosive Shells and First Aid kits on his team; not to mention the rather standard Twinoid build for his spies! In addition, he has a good assortment of grenades and Loaders! It is weird that he does not have shells on his super-imbalanced spies though...In addition, he has only one Sab and no Doctor at all…And finally, he does not use any launchers at all, though he has been seen using tanks!<br>On the other hand, Nevermore is well-known for his vehicles and he seems to have a lot of Wife Beaters; on top of that, he’s got a lot of Explosive and Hydroshock Shells! He has two launchers, and in contrast to the former’s CK-based team, Nevermore opts for a lot of firepower through his HMG team!<br>So let us go to the battle history and see what people say about them!<br>BATTLE HISTORY:<br>As Pause has pointed out, there are certain factors to look for in every Caine vs. Nevermore match:<br>1. Caine’s spies in=Auto DL for Caine<br>2. Caine’s spies out=Auto DL for Nevermore<br>3. Nevermore’s tanks in=Auto DL for Nevermore<br>4. Nevermore’s tanks out=Auto DL for Caine<br>This is considered to be one of the highest-level rivalries in the English MT server, and it is expected that these two teams will fight at their best!<br>LINEUPS:<br>CAINE: (BLUE ARMY, LEFT SIDE)<br>Caine, Spy 12<br>Harko, Comms 12<br>Flash, Munitions 12<br>Volga, Comms 11<br>Drovia, Comms 13<br>Imptigo, Soldier 12<br>Purgamen, Spy 13<br>Storm, Sab 12<br>Nalieva, Pilot 12<br>Tsores, Munitions 12<br>NEVERMORE: (YELLOW ARMY, RIGHT SIDE)<br>Nevermore, Soldier 11<br>Lust, Spy 12<br>Gluttony, Spy 11<br>Envy, Spy 10<br>Wrath, Comms 11<br>Greed, Doctor 11<br>Pride, Sab 11<br>Eddy Edi, Comms 11<br>Melust, Spy 12<br>Samonnell, Sab 11<br>Chripp Brute, Pilot 12<br>Hulko, Doctor 10<br>So, I guess the pre-game analysis is over. Only one question remains: Who will win?<br>Let us find out together, ladies and gentlemen! This is the 1st match of the May Melee grand final!<br>Cross your fingers…and go!<br>MATCH VIEW:<br>1st Wave:<br>CAINE: Caine, Harko, Flash<br>NEVERMORE: Lust, Melust, Chripp Brute and Wrath<br>Flash starts the battle with a shot from his CK, making Melust drop his feared HMG; Caine starts topump his shotgun against the tank, but to no avail! Lust starts shooting, and Caine takes the Twinoid! Once again, he aims for the tank, but it’s just too tanky! Meanwhile, Lust took out Flash and Harko in a blink of an eye using his explosive shells, and Wrath decided to shoot Caine; finally, the tank driver decides to send the crazy spy to the ground!<br>2ND WAVE:<br>CAINE: Nalieva, Impetigo, Harko (Survivor)<br>The blue pilot lobs a flash grenade, hitting Nevermore’s spy team, and then Harko throws a well-placed HE grenade for the kill! Nalieva takes down Melust with one shot, and then Impetigo takes the Twinoid and destroys the tank!<br>Fortunately for Nevermore, his driver had Fall Guy on him! Meanwhile, Harko has got a Solo Mission, and he does not permit Chripp Brute to stand up again! Wrath avenges his friends too late and too little to be able to do anything, and it’s only a matter of cleaning up for Caine…<br>NEVERMORE: Pride, Envy, Gluttony, Hulko<br>Pride is very eager to avenge his friends’ losses; he throws a Shock Grenade, shoots the pilot, and all this time, both sides have been throwing grenades and exchanging blows! Finally, Nalieva dies from a combination of Poison and gunshots, and the coward quickly retreats like a woman!<br>3rd WAVE:<br>CAINE: Tsores, Volga<br>Pride once again lives his name by taking down Volga, and it’s 1v4!<br>Tsores throws a Shock Grenade, then makes Envy kiss the ground, loads his gun, lets off a stream of bullets, then the doctor goes six feet down the edge, Gluttony bites the dust, and Pride goes down!<br>It’s a rampage by Tsores!!!<br>NEVERMORE: Greed, Nevermore, Eddy Edi, Purgamen (SPY)<br>Purgamen takes the Twinoid, plays a while with Eddy Edi, and then kills off the entire wave! Then Samonnell comes in only to fly to the heavens!!!<br>GG WP for Caine here!<br>POST-MATCH ANALYSIS:<br>Caine seemed to be dead after Volga died, but Tsores has put up a good fight, enough for Purgamen to appear and finish things off!<br>MAN OF THE MATCH should be given to Tsores; without him, Caine would have been destroyed very, very quickly.<br>FLOP OF THE MATCH goes to the tank driver, Chripp Brute, who did not live up to his reputation and remained idle for the rest of the match!<br>BREAKING POINT was the time where Tsores threw that Shock Grenade; it gave him enough time to stabilize his weapons!<br>SCORE: 8.5/10! A very good comeback by Caine, as well as a pretty good performance by Nevermore!<br>NOTE: This game has shown that if the tanks and the spies appear at the same time, both teams have a chance of winning. In this case, Caine had the better game plan, so he won the game!<br>I GUESS THAT’S ALL! HAVE A GOOD DAY GUYS!<br>&lt;IcS&gt;LostInDreams</p>
