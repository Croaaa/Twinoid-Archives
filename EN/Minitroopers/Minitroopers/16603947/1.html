                <p>Alright I have a general idea of a game I'd like to run by you guys. Similar to the RISK World Domination I'd like to expound this playstyle to see the interest of players. Participation in this game will also be strict at times so fair warning.</p><p>First off this would be a team game. I will divide you based on several factors, hopefully making the teams balanced. If anything the game will be either short or long depending on participants. Being included into a game in progress will require my direction. I will run moderation(therefore participation by me will not happen to limit bias), and so there will be no confusion to my judgement calls.</p><p>Also to peak interest I will be posting highlights on youtube. You'll see that the time I put into this idea will work out.</p><p>So as I stated, this is a team game. Even weaker members will have roles in this game.</p><p>Basic Rules</p><p>Starting<br>-The objective of the game is for your team to control the entire board.<br>-The board will be either made or set based on participant number. Territories will be assigned for each team by the moderator. There will be no neutral lands(unless stated otherwise for special rules).<br>-Once teams are made each player may place themselves on any territory their team owns, team mates may and are encouraged to be together on lands to harden defense on lands.</p><p>Game will go...<br>Setup<br>Target Phase<br>Combat Phase<br>Capture Phase<br>End Turn Phase<br>Revival Phase<br>Strategy Phase<br>Reset Phase</p><p>Game Setup<br>-At the start of a new turn players attack bordering lands that they are stationed on in an attempt to conquer their opponents' land.<br>-All lands need not be occupied for the land to be on a teams territory.(See Capture and Revive Phases)</p><p>Target Phase<br>-Any unit still alive may combat as many times as they are able until a single defeat.(You may limit your battles to play other games on the server, etc.)<br>-When targeting a bordering land, you are to choose a target posted on the land and engage combat, multiple armies on a land means.</p><p>Combat Phase<br>-Battles between opposing teams go on individual basis.<br>-Everyone has 1 life so be careful choosing targets.<br>-All battles(won or lost) must be posted. Only "infiltration" combat will count.<br>-Winner lives, loser is put into reserves.</p><p>Capture Phase<br>-In order to conquer a land, every member defending the land must be defeated.(ex. 5 people are posted on a single land, each one of them must be defeated in order to capture)<br>-All units who assaulted the targeted land are relocated on to the lands they capture.<br>-If you can continue fighting after a capture you may, as long as you target lands you still border.<br>-In the case of a successful defense(and only defense) see End Phase.<br>-In the case above, if both parties attack and defend from each other, all living members will be moved.<br>-All living units that participate in the capture also earn 1 capture point. This only applies to captures that require a battle.<br>-To capture an unoccupied land you must illicitly state you are capturing the land during Combat phase, and you leave your current position. You may continue combat same afterwards. This action costs 1 capture point and may not be done if you do not have a capture point.<br>-All land captures are first to post basis unless moderator discovers a mistake. It is then their call to see who is the owner of the land, or if a bomb goes off and the land becomes neutral and conquered by a rough band of mercenaries or is a barren wasteland.(It will be explicitly stated during Reset Phase).<br>-ALL CAPTURE POINTS ARE LOST UPON DEATH.</p><p>End Turn Phase<br>-This phase immediately begins the following server reset.<br>-All combat will cease for a whole server's day worth of time to allow for the next phases. No battles will count during this time for this game.</p><p>Revival Phase<br>-Each time an army is defeated they are put into their team's revival pool.<br>-The first people to die in combat will be the first ones available to be revived.<br>-Each army has a limited number of revives per active turn. There will be a set minimum based on the number of players, and this may increase based on the team's number of owned territories.(ex. The minimum of a game would be 2 armies revived. The ratio for the game for additional revives would be 4 lands for 1 extra army. A team owns 8 lands, therefore they have 4 people come back for the next turn.)</p><p>Strategy Phase<br>-During this phase, players may reassign themselves to lands own by their team as long as they are bordering them.<br>-They will not publicly state where they will assign themselves, but PM the moderator, who will keep track of who is who. This is where communication is very important.<br>-Any army land locked away from friendly lands will not be able to change locations.<br>-A unit who is revived, but does not state where they want to be place will automatically be placed on the land with the most friendly armies. In the case of a tie I will flip a coin or roll a dice(not to be posted here).</p><p>Reset Phase<br>-The moderator will then post the new standings of locations and current living armies, as well as dead armies waiting to be revived.<br>-This will happen as soon as every participant has sent the moderator a PM or on the next server reset.<br>-It will not be exactly on time, but the game will not be declared open until the post has been placed. All battles before the Reset Phase is complete will not count.</p><p>Additional Rules<br>-It is the moderators discretion to remove players, and call disputes on all game matters(which is why I won't participate in the game to minimize bias).<br>-Special Rules may be put into action, such as limited amounts of battles. All rules such as those will be explicitly stated at the beginning of the rounds. Additional rules and objectives will not be added per round till next round.</p><p>Reference Vid(Still being uploaded)<br><a href="http://youtu.be/8Tze67A-zq0" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/8Tze67A-zq0</a> (part 1, parts 2 and 3 will be on my channel)</p>

                <p>Alright I did say before that I wanted to include a use for the random number generators, namely the dice.</p><p>So I'm taking an inspiration from one of my other favorite games(and making this idea crazy complicated) Settlers of Catan.</p><p>Now before anyone busts a nut, I'll be in charge of organizing resources so everyone will accurately know what everyone has.</p><p>So those who don't know, Catan is a game of playing probability and planning routes based on how you want to win the game(using resources and playing the odds). What I want to include is a resources system(which guarantees the use of a life and movement system in this game) which will provide bonuses and tactical capture and defense of resource points needed in battle.</p><p>I would have to add...<br>-Equipment Phase<br>-Resource Phase A<br>-Resource Phase B</p><p>Each territory would have a resource and a number. Collection of different resources would provide players(or teams depending on number and how I tweek the system), which they would be able to convert into special abilities such as...</p><p>-Artillery taking life points from targets<br>-Reinforcements regaining life or revive points<br>-Morale boosts additional movement or capture during combat phase<br>-Barricades temporary additional defense for all units stationed on a territory (Will be limited in number per team)<br>-Minefields to protect unguarded territory and damage/kill the opponents who attempt to capture(Will be limited in number per team, and does not distinguish friend or foe)<br>-Minefield Detection to disarm minefields<br>-Mercenaries/PMC, I can't let you guys have all the fun(may or may not be myself).<br>-I'm open to ideas and I'm bound to come up with more</p><p>There will be resource trading available also, whether it be with a neutral bank, team mates, or other teams.</p><p>So at the beginning of your bouts(this would be after Combat Phase, Resource Phase A). The player declaring an attack would roll a 6 sided dice(may change based on ideas). I probably will make it allowed to have 1 die roll per bout you put in(afterall I want to give motivation for players to play). Each territory will have a die roll number and a resource. All players(or teams) who are on the the rolled number gain the corresponding resource(which I will calculate and come into play only in Resource Phase B) in their cache.</p><p>At the end of the turn of the day, starting at End Turn Phase, Resource Phase B is where I will count up the days rolls and captures(I will be very careful to take into account of moving units, captures, land exchanges, and deaths) exactly in order from start to finish. Then along with the standings I will post resources in the listings and during Strategy Phase you must publicly post what you are purchasing. However, if you buy minefields you must PM the moderator to where you want to set them up after your team's Strategy Phase(if no mention of using the minefield is said then they will not be on the field). Trading will be only allowed during Strategy Phase also, you may freely give items and resources to anyone as well. Items may be used freely during Strategy Phase also, however...</p><p>Every player will have one Equipment Phase during turn. Players will be able to activate their Equipment Phase anytime while they are still alive, but only once. They do not have to fight to post that they are using an item, which can be before or after their combat posts.</p><p>I hope this complete idea will have some following, I'll be posting a full and correct rulebook around the time signups will begin.</p>

                <p>Here's an example of how I would list the players during the Reset Phase. This will assume that the base will be 1 movement point, 1 capture point, and 3 lives given at the start of the game. Also assumes that you can only have 3 maximum of each resource(I will not yet reveal the costs of each ability, but you should get a general idea.</p><p><strong>Player Profile Examples</strong>:</p><p>Name:SilentPinoy<br>Team:Red(The Crimson Conquerors)</p><p>Lives(HP): 3<br>Movement Points(MP): 1<br>Capture Points(CP): 1</p><p>Resources(Not final draft):<br>Number of Resource Cards(Seen in Public): 9<br>(This list will only be seen in Private Group Chat, handled and organized by myself)<br>Reinforcements: 1/3<br>Rations: 2/3<br>Armaments: 0/3<br>Morale: 3/3<br>Materials: 0/3<br>Medicine: 3/3</p><p>Equipment on Hand(Not final draft):<br>Items on Hand(This is seen in public): 8<br>(This list is only seen in Private Group Chat)<br>Artillery (x1)<br>Movement (x1)<br>Life Up (x2)<br>Revive (x1)<br>Command: Paratroopers (x1)<br>Command: Recon (x1)<br>Command: Retreat(x1)</p><br><p>Name:*Example Army*<br>Team:Green(The Emperors of Victory)</p><p>Lives(HP): 4<br>Movement Points(MP): 0<br>Capture Points(CP): 2</p><p>Resources(Not final draft):<br>Reinforcements: 3/3<br>Rations: 0/3<br>Armaments: 0/3<br>Morale: 1/3<br>Materials: 1/3<br>Medicine: 3/3</p><p>Equipment on Hand(Not final draft):<br>Artillery (x2)<br>Life Up (x2)<br>Revive (x1)<br>Command: Recon (x1)<br>Command: Decoy (x1)<br>Command: Raid (x1)</p><br><p><strong>Team Listing Example(End Turn Phase):</strong></p><p>The Crimson Conquerors(Red)</p><p>Members:<br>SilentPinoy (HP 3/MP 1/CP 1) POS: C5<br>Army 1 (HP 1/MP 2/CP 0) POS: C5<br>Army 2 (HP 0/MP 1/CP 3) POS: DEAD<br>Army 3 (HP 0/MP 1/CP 1) POS: DEAD<br>Army 4 (HP 3/MP 1/CP 2) POS: Awaiting Redeployment (Was on top of the Death Queue, this team has 1 team revive)</p><p>Death Queue (Can be hidden/revealed if item is used)<br>Army 3<br>Army 2</p><p>Team Equipment (Can be hidden/revealed if item is used)<br>Minefields: 0/2<br>Barricades: 1/2<br>Mercenaries: 0/2<br>Field Hospital: 1/2<br>Black-Ops: 0/1</p><br><p><strong>Team Listing Example(Reset Phase):</strong></p><p>The Crimson Conquerors(Red)</p><p>Members:<br>SilentPinoy (HP 3/MP 1/CP 1) POS: B4 (Repositioned)<br>Army 1 (HP 3/MP 3/CP 0) POS: A1 (Used movement up and hp up cards)<br>Army 2 (HP 1/MP 1/CP 3) POS: B4 (Revive was used on him)<br>Army 3 (HP 0/MP 1/CP 1) POS: DEAD<br>Army 4 (HP 3/MP 1/CP 2) POS: C3 (Selected Position)</p><p>Death Queue<br>Army 3</p><p>Minefields: 1/2<br>Barricades: 1/2<br>Mercenaries: 0/2<br>Field Hospital: 0/2<br>Black-Ops: 1/1</p><br><br><p>Edit:<br>Upon noticing this idea, I will not force the public note of purchasing items(depending on my rules standing on start of game). Resources and individual items will still be semi-revealed, however team items will not be posted(I may also force revives to be team items), unless certain items are used(to be revealed later). This is just to tease more ideas I've come up with. Also since I will be moderating the use of items and resources I will have on list, and I will make private chat rooms for your entire team along with me so I can deliver your things so everyone can see what resources you share.</p>
