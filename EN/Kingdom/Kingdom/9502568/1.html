                Q 147: I have a question regarding the collection of rare resources.  There is a village two points away from my territory that has a meadow controlled by another player.  The connecting village between my territory and the other player's is a savage village.  I am considering offering an exchange of resources with the other player (my outermost territory there has an Iron mine).<br><br>Here is my question, though. If I made the deal, and the territory remains savage, would I or the other player be able to collect resources from each other if the village remains neutral territory and we only grant each other collection rights?  I was granted collection rights by another player, but that also included the right of passage as well.  The deal I am mulling over would not include passage rights.<br><br>I should also note that the player I am planning to propose this deal to has a master.  Would I need to ask the player's master for collection permission, or can the follower grant it irrespective of what his master may want?  Here's an additional question.  Does the permission of a master  to travel their territory also include being allowed to travel in their followers territory?

                Savage villages have nothing to do with it. It just means it'll take bloody ages to travel through it. Unless you mean that the resources are at the savage village, in which case one of you will need to capture it before you can extract the goodies. Either way, you should do so anyway before anyone else does <img src="http://data.muxxu.com/img/icons/forum_lol.gif"><br><br>If you have at least a level 1 wall and don't give him right of passage, he won't be able to move past the first village of yours he arrives at. Looking at the map, it would probably take him so long to go all the way around that it probably wouldn't be worth the hassle.<br><br>A master has no control over who his followers enter into diplomatic agreements with (well, aside from bullying at least hehe), nor can masters give others access to their followers' land. Only the direct owner can grant such a privilege.

                No.  The savage village is between the borders of our kingdoms.  His meadow is at the edge of his territory and my mine is at the edge of mine.  The savage village is between us.  I would consider taking it myself, but it's four points away from my Capital and it would take ages before I would get a positive trade value from it.<br><br>That is why I want to know if I can collect if there is a savage village between our territories.

                There are actually <em>two</em> savage villages between your kingdom and his: <a href="http://kingdom.en.muxxu.com/map?c=26072" target="_top">Barnaton</a> and <a href="http://kingdom.en.muxxu.com/map?c=26370" target="_top">Kiluchover</a>. Despite their proximity, there is no direct path between his meadow and Barnaton.<br><br>One of you will need to capture Kiluchover (the savage village next to his meadow) as there are barbarian troops there who will not let you pass.<br><br>It's a while since I played this game now, but as far as I recall, savage villages have <em>a lot</em> to do with it.<br><a href="http://kingdom.en.muxxu.com/help?h=rareres" target="_top">Help &gt; Rare Resources</a>:<cite>Each location where you find these resources must be connected to your kingdom in order for you to collect them.</cite><br>Normally, having one or more savage villages between your kingdom and the resources you wish to collect would mean that you could not collect them as there would not be a safe route back to your capital for them to take. However, in your case, your two kingdoms are directly connected further along the border, between <a href="http://kingdom.en.muxxu.com/map?c=26427" target="_top">Berkechesey</a> and <a href="http://kingdom.en.muxxu.com/map?c=26402" target="_top">Penirough</a>, so the resources should be able to find their way back to your respective capitals via this alternate route. I'm not certain, but I don't think that either of you would need to grant the other right of passage for that to work, as it's only the resources that would be travelling the length of your kingdoms, not your generals. However, I think one or other of you will have to grant right of passage for the following reason...<br><br>You, or the other player, are going to have to capture the village with the barbarian troops in any case. If he takes it, you would have to take two steps inside his kingdom to reach his meadow and would therefore need to have passage rights. His general would be able to leave his kingdom, passing through the remaining savage village, to enter your kingdom and collect from your mine without the need for passage rights (as your mine would be just inside your border). If, on the other hand, you were to capture Kiluchover - in which case, it would make sense for you to capture the village closer to you as well, providing your finances can cope with the negative trade, as passing through savage villages slows down your generals - he would have to pass through at least one territory of yours in order to reach the iron mine and so would need you to grant him right of passage. He would not need to grant you right of passage though as his meadow would be adjacent to your newly-expanded kingdom, meaning you could enter his kingdom, collect the resources, then turn around and go back the way you came.<br><br>Another option would be for you each to capture the savage village nearest your respective capitals. This would move your kingdoms' border further away from both resources, meaning that you would both need passage rights in order to be able to collect.<br><br>I hope that all made sense!

                I thought he was talking about Penarland as that only has one village in between? Anyway, you don't have to be connected to collect resources from someone else's kingdom. A lot of my resources during the first part of my game were taken from someone with 5 empty villages between us.
