                Well ,it's kinda hard for everyone to understand what's happening to you (or with you) because your English is HORRIBLE. Starting from the title: "Please help my be a bug" What does that mean? You want us to help you to become a bug? But you can't spell "me". Or is it that you want us to help your... someone to become a bug. <img src="http://data.muxxu.com/img/icons/forum_lookup.gif"> <br>And the first post? I read it like 5 times, and it's only getting funnier <img src="http://data.muxxu.com/img/icons/forum_lol.gif"> and less understandable.<br><br>If your reading is as good as your writing, then there's a remote possibility that, in fact, the game is just fine and you, uh... misinterpreted the way it works. Or it could actually be a bug, in which case we will see to help you... or the bug... or whatever

                To the last responder: the original post headline should have been "Please help MAY be a bug." The player thought he was experiencing a bug in the game, when he was attacked.<br><br>His last post suggests he thought there was a problem yesterday (Wednesday 9/14) because he couldn't log in to the game. As it was, I had the same problem, and got an error regarding an SQL problem of too many logins. It cleared up around 2 am ET this morning. So no, that wasn't your machine, that was everyone. <br><br>It seems there should be a better explanation of masters, followers and what they mean to each other, in the FAQ.<br><br>I've also in another post here, that there's a French site, <a href="http://www.twinpedia.com/muxxu/kingdom/unites" target="_top">http://www.twinpedia.com/muxxu/kingdom/u nites</a>, that displays the cost of building units, their combat odds against each other, and the levels of each building and their raw material requirements. These charts would be an excellent resource to add to any onsite FAQ here.<br><br>In English, por favor.<br><br>MBB

                <cite>Next time, be sure you select "deny right of passage" in the diplomacy screen. I think it's the default even.</cite><br>The default is that the follower <em>does</em> have right of passage:<cite><a href="http://kingdom.en.muxxu.com/help?h=vassal" target="_top">A master automatically has right of passage and the authority to collect resources in his follower's kingdom. In return, followers can move freely throughout their master's kingdom (see the Diplomacy section).</a></cite><br>You can deny your followers access to your rare resources but, as far as I'm aware, there is nothing you can do to prevent them travelling at will through your kingdom. That's just a perk of being a follower. Denying right of passage to a follower using the diplomacy options does not appear to have any effect. When you consider that your follower's capital is part of your kingdom, any movement they make from there is, of necessity, through your kingdom. If you were able to deny them right of passage, they wouldn't be able to move their generals at all.<br><br>On the other hand, a follower is unable to deny his master right of passage or access to resources, regardless of whether the diplomacy settings say otherwise. Right of passage is necessary between the master's capital and the follower's in order for the master to collect taxes. If the follower were to have control over this, they would be able to withold payment.<br><br>(I think what I've just said is correct, based on playing both as a master and as a follower under both good and bad masters, but I could be mistaken. Three games in and the various diplomacy options combined with Master/Follower/Friend relationships still leave me somewhat confused about exactly who can do what.)

                i think i understand what happened...let me see if I can explain it in proper english and you can confirm that this is what happened..<br><br>You took over his capital and left some armies there. <br>He marched to your capital and attacked it. Your defense was not strong enough and he won the attack.<br>After he took over your capital he was able to revolt.<br><br>1st off: once you take over anyone's capital they have the right to march anywhere they want in your kingdom, just as you have the right to march anywhere you want in their kingdom. This means the person you took over can move to any city they wish to in your kingdom, attack it, take that city over, and collect taxes on that city. You, however, can also do the very same to them. IE: they have a city connected to their kindom which is no where near your primary kindom. You march to that city and take it over. Even though it is not connected to your kingdom directy, as long as their kingdom is connected to yours, and the city you took over is connected to their kingdom; by defualt that city is now connected to your kingdom.<br><br>2nd off: If someone takes over your kingdom all your cities become savage villages again, and armies you have left in villages owned by other people act like they do at a savage village. They pretty much pretend you do not own them until you move to that city again and ask them to join your army again since they will reconize you. (maybe someone else can verify this). <br><br>So what basically happened was he had free access to your kingdom. He marched up to your capital and attacked it. Your defense was not strong enough to prevent him from winning the battle, but his status was too low to actually take control of your capital(IE your a marquius and he was a sir). So instead of taking over your captial, your captial remained yours, BUT your villages became savaged villages again and your armies in other peoples capitals basically became a savage army. Once he revolted he probably had to kill the savages you left in defense there at his capital, but I am sure the game would not have made it sound like he was "too scared to revolt" since the person owning his capital no longer is associated with the army you previously had left there.<br><br>On a side note most villages you have taken over right now could most likely revolt against you. So until you go back to their capitals and reclaim your armies there, dont expect any capital to be safe from revolting.

                A follower is not permitted to attack his master's territory if the master has troops defending it. I'm also pretty certain that a follower can't attack his master's capital even if it is undefended. If I recall correctly, you get a message telling you that you have to revolt first.<br><br>My theory about what happened is this:<br>1) The follower revolts - hear me out adisor! - defeating the ballistas and paladins you left at his capital<br>2) He then attacks your capital with his catapults and captures it<br>3) You see the message saying that he is revolting<br><br>If you weren't logged into Muxxu at the time he revolted, or you were playing one of the other games, or you were matching symbols on the production grid, you won't have received the notification about the revolt until you returned to your Kingdom home page which may have been quite some time after the revolt actually took place.<br><br>What I'm not sure about is whether he would have been able to attack your capital as soon as the revolt had started or whether he would have needed to defeat the troops you left at his capital first. If he was able to attack you as soon as he began the revolt then it's possible that what happened is this:<br>1) Your follower begins a revolt<br>2) Whilst the battle at his capital is going on, his general attacks your capital and his catapults overpower your defences<br>3) Your capital falls, your kingdom is destroyed, your villages revert to savage villages and your followers (including him) are freed.<br>4) His capital is no longer part of your kingdom and the ballistas and paladins you left there are no longer under your command which means that your former follower wins that battle by default regardless of how well or badly it was going for him.<br>5) You see the message that he is revolting
