                <p>Just a bit of chat with this player.

You fucking traitor.<br>Today at 10:39<br>ZLOJ<br>You :<br><br>You are greatly over estimating your potential.

This is final warning. Are you also happy with this?<br>Sunday at 23:52<br>Punnicaleen<br>Punnicaleen<br><br>I'm guessing I will be long dead by then, so no, I don't mind. I also don't mind if I am alive AND emperor. Count it as a gesture of goodwill.<br>Sunday at 23:50<br>ZLOJ<br>You :<br><br>I hope you don't mind that, right?<br>Sunday at 23:49<br>ZLOJ<br>You :<br><br>Yes, but I will have them back when I'm close to emperor if we live up to that time. As well everything I'll need.<br>Sunday at 23:49<br>Punnicaleen<br>Punnicaleen<br><br>I am happy to have reached honest agreement.

I wanted to use it as a base of operations to that guy's capital. But I have wasted hundreds of soldiers in the battle and maybe too much energy. Anyway.. Would you really call your current attitude "friendly"? I wouldn't. You tell me that I sound like giving you an ultimatum but then what is it that you are doing?<br><br>Right now I am quite close to being "emperor" and I do not want to waste anymore time battling someone else; even though it's a war that I am sure to win. My reason for battling xyck is vanishing and there's no more need for deploying hundreds of soldiers there. But still; I would rather use that force expanding 10 more villages than battle.<br><br>What do you say then? Do you want to battle and stop growth or give me Ballying and Extonia and continue to live like two big kingdoms neighboring each other? I don't see stopping communication as a way of agreement.<br>Sunday at 23:37<br>ZLOJ<br>You :<br><br>Just let me know of your decision so that I can tell my generals where to go next.<br>Sunday at 23:06<br>ZLOJ<br>You :<br><br>I would like to also remind you that being in war with that dying duke, having that pesky village that you are trying to let go of and having smaller trade than I do with almost ( actually same in 2 days ) population should convince you to consider my proposal. If, however, you still want to have both those villages - feel free to take them and I won't take any actions, but do not expect any further friendship or negotiations with me.<br>Sunday at 23:05<br>Punnicaleen<br>Punnicaleen<br><br>Well actually Extonia was already mine before "idiot" took it and I was just too busy to get there and retake it. Therefore I am negotiating you for only one town after the death of "idiot", which is Ballying.<br>Sunday at 22:59<br>ZLOJ<br>You :<br><br>I think it is fair to split those 2. You got the bigger part of the map, right? Please, be reasonable and choose one. I'm not a small viscount anymore, and your 'friendly' proposal sounds like an ultimatum.<br></cite></p>

                <p>Hello.</p><p>It is interesting that this guy has posted this conversation on forums aswell. I have heard from my followers that he also sent them this to try to convince them to revolt in favor of him.</p><p>I do not know if it is clear to the reader but at the bottom of the page I am the one who types the message:</p><p><cite>Well actually Extonia was already mine before "idiot" took it and I was just too busy to get there and retake it. Therefore I am negotiating you for only one town after the death of "idiot", which is Ballying.</cite></p><p>Where "idiot" is a player nicknamed "idiot".</p><p>I also would like it to be known that even though ZLOJ has not uttered a word about it, after agreeing my terms, saying:</p><p><cite>You are greatly over estimating your potential. But I have no other option than accept your terms <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"></cite></p><p>He went on to gather his army and attack my outlying barbarian villages, and then continued to move on to my trading villages.</p><p><strong>So he agreed to have peace, and then attacked.</strong> That's where I call him a traitor, which is the word used to describe people undertaking such behavior in the English Language. He blames me with being "arrogant" and "rude", but what then is being a liar?</p><p>Anyway, I had been on vacation, playing from the tiny screen of a smartphone, but now I am back to reclaim my land.</p><p>For those who wonder the result of his efforts, no, he could not move to my capital. Right now he is a few towns away from it. In the meanwhile I also had been able to obtain the "emperor" title with the help of the very same followers whom he had tried to make revolt.</p><p>Also, now that I am talking about it, I also would like it to be known that this guy is maybe one of the greatest griefers in this game:</p><p>I have an offensive army with cats, so whenever I attack a town, he flees the battle, making my army "defend" the location, and then goes on to attack back, putting my offensive army on the defensive side.</p><p>It may sound very smart at first, but he does it continuously, and I am sure that this is not how this game was meant to be played. I actually wanted to report him for abusing this function in the game, but could not find how to, and while I was searching for it I stubled upon this post of his.</p><p>Thanks for reading <em>my</em> side of the story.</p>

                <p>Well, he isn't exactly threatening you, is he? I think you're the one really threatening him. You agreed for peace and then you backstabbed him? You say you didn't even "read" the forum post, but I'm sure you did. You're abusing a function of the game (I think) and now you just seem angry you attacked someone stronger than you just to waste his time and you're losing.</p>

                <p>That's a perfectly legit tactic. Note that he does lose all the trade, some reputation and ~7 soldiers for forfeiting the battle, AND he has to be really active for that to work.</p><p>My advice is, don't attack a node with an enemy general stationed already.</p>
