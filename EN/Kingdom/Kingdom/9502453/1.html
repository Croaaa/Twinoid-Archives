                This is just a thought, it can take improvements and everyone can chime in. Also not sure if the developers will actually read it or put any thought in it, but I guess if many people like it then perhaps it would be possible. Anyhow, it's something I had in my head for a while and wanted to share. It's a long post I know, sorry. <strong>Cliff notes at the end.</strong><br><br>I was thinking maybe there should be a "surrender" option, with which the weak side would avoid war, keep all their areas, soldiers and trade, in exchange for added tax. In various situations this could benefit both the defender and the attacker. Let me explain.<br><br>Imagine we have an attacker with 300 troops and a defender with 150 troops. Also for the purpose of our example, suppose all units are the same. The defender represents the weak side and with such a weak army he clearly doesn't stand a chance. Why lose all of his troops, all of his trade and be left with only his capital and then have to spend quite a lot of turns (which also means get older) just to bring his army/trade back to where it was? He surrenders and keeps everything but in return he pays more taxes to his master. In our example this could be good for the attacker as well because if he had to fight this war, win obviously, but lose half of his army, then he could face serious economic crisis especially if it's a distant kingdom. So perhaps he could get away with it by not having to fight, and in return he would receive more taxes from his follower.<br><br>Now if the defender thinks he could win this war then he may choose to fight. If he loses then it's basically what happens already in the game, he keeps only his capital with no troops in it and whatever savagers are left in other areas that weren't killed, but he will be paying only the standard 20% tax to his master.<br><br>What's the procedure for this? Obviously this would be done only manually, not automatically. The defender would have to actually see or suspect or whatever, that the attacker plans to come for his kingdom BEFORE the war begins, then click a "surrender" option, attacker receives a notification and no war is happening. If the attacker has already commenced war in one of the defender's areas, then he cannot surrender anymore. Surrendering automatically gives right of passage to the attacker, who then travels quickly to the defender's capital and claims it. The kingdom now belongs to his kingdom and he starts to collect added taxes.<br><br>How much taxes? If 20% is the standard, surrendering will increase to 30% or 40% which in the long run could be a very significant increase for the master's profit, provided that the follower is good at managing his economy.<br><br>Would the attacker have an option to decide if he accepts the surrender? Well normally you would expect that he should have that option, but I'd say no, because that way the game also protects newly established kingdoms surrounded by powerful forces. That option would leave them in peace in order to build their kingdom without having to worry about rebuilding their entire army and trade. Of course the added taxes would be a little problem, but sometimes it could be a much better alternative, especially if his economy is in a good state and can take the load of those extra taxes.<br><br>Also I was thinking, something to protect the attacker as well. If the defender chooses to surrender, then he can never revolt, not even if the master leaves no army to the follower's capital. The 2 sides remain bounded together forever, until one of them dies so the bond is released.<br><br><strong>Cliff notes:<br><br>Attacker plans to attack the defender. Defender surrenders before the war begins, attacker receives a notification. There is no war happening (unless it started before defender surrendered). Attacker is automatically granted right of passage to quickly go to defender's capital. Defender is now follower, he can never revolt, he also pays 30% or 40% taxes instead of 20% which is standard. But he keeps all of his areas, troops and trade as if nothing ever happened. With surrender option the game also protects newly established kingdoms and gives them a chance to grow, so the attacker has to accept it if he wants to continue. Defender (and now follower) may take longer to grow due to the added taxes but at least it's something, instead of nothing.<br><br>In the end, defender has to analyse the situation. Does he have enough army to fight this war and if yes, how about his economy after the war is over? If he surrenders, is his economy strong enough to take the load of extra taxes? Analysing the situation and planning ahead is what it's all about.</strong>

                Interesting possibility.<br><br>I like the restriction that the defender who is surrenduring cannot revolt. Also, that the attacker can choose whether or not to accept the surrender.<br><br>Speaking as a master, there was one fellow who I did attack as punishment for his misusing my resources (more than once), so I wouldn't have accepted his surrender (I would not have trusted him afterwards, so I didn't want to leave him with a large force). But the other followers I have, I would have accepted surrenders from all of them. And I'm sure they would have gladly kept their forces and lands intact -- although, keep in mind, there are plenty of times when it's beneficial to allow someone to conquer your kingdom, especially if you have a negative trade, and being conquered would reset your trade.<br><br>So, the question is, why bother fighting a battle at all, if you're obviously going to lose? I mean, if someone arrives at your capital with an overwhelming force, there's never going to be a reason to hold out, is there?<br><br>This is, of course, only in effect for an attack on a capital, right?<br><br>i could also see the restriction being that the follower can't revolt for a limited time, say, 10 of the follower's years, or maybe 20. One of them will likely die before then, anyway.<br><br>BTW: I've been collecting some ideas I'd love to see in a Kingdom 2.0. Things like:<br>-- Being able to retain your villagers, being able to rerout a general before he arrives at a preplanned destination;<br>-- A column on the Leaders board for the Health status of each monarch, a current game time clock on each page (so I don't have to do mental calculations late at night);<br>-- My previous suggestion that Prestige be tied to a General's ability to line up his/her forces before an attack.<br><br>Maybe we should have a special thread just for suggestions on improving the game.<br><br>But yeah, I see the Surrender option as being an interesting idea, too.

                Gut feeling - no it would badly unbalance the game.<br><br>Right now, to attack another kingdom means both the attacker and the attackee will loose significant forces (unless they make arrangements ahead of time - which I have done). The looser will loose his kingdom and have to spend time reclaiming it.<br><br>With surrender, no one looses anything and both kingdoms can immediately continue plowing through the other players. The current system puts a limit on this.<br><br>I can also see ways this could be gamed to let people earn titles without working for it - say a ring of three or more duke who just sequentially surrender to each other allowing each to have a time as an emperor.

                Here's what might happen: A master might repeatedly attack a follower, in order to get as close to 100% taxes as possible. Now, I doubt any of us want that, do we?

                To Sid,<br><br>I'm sure, if the Surrender option is ever incorporated -- and it's not a bad idea -- that Kingdom rules could easily be tweaked to prohibit you from piling tax level upon tax level onto the same surrendering general or player.<br><br>It might also simply be disallowed: maybe, you can only use one surrender between players. For example: Player A can surrender to Player B only once; after that, all battles between A and B must be fought to conclusion. You could also add in a provision that once a surrender happens between A and B, no combat can be initiated for 24 hours between those two players, in order to allow the surrendering forces to get the heck outta Dodge.<br><br>Dave
