                <p>Trade will kill him, taking your village is an instant -200 which is more than half of his trade. If he survives the hit, your next village will finish him off. I would've let him take the village and the village after that, saved all my troops and holed up at my capital. If he takes both villages and his general is still with his troops, he's likely not taking turns (to avoid bankruptcy) so all you have to do basically is hold him off at your capital (assuming he's coming there next), using your wall to your advantage. That's where you'll give it all and fight for your pride. If you hold him off long enough, eventually he's gonna have to take turns and hopefully go bankrupt. If that happens during battle, a good chunk of his troops will start fleeing on their own (you'll watch that happen in the battle logs), depending on how long he remains bankrupt while taking turns. His general is considerably stronger than your army but he's alone, there's no way he's getting any reinforcements, but you will. Make as many mounted archers as you can, you know you can do this during battle right? There's no better unit to buy yourself time. On top of that, he's already in bad health. That's how I would've played. Now since you decided to fight for your village, forget about your general let him soften the enemy, let him take the next village too but don't remove your troops (removing troops gives the enemy access) just don't reinforce, while you prepare yourself in your capital. I dunno if you'll come out on top you're in a pretty tough spot but I think that's your best bet. Good luck.</p>

                <p>Not that I blame you for trying but what's bad about taking advice over the forums is that everyone can read it, including your enemy. Also, I assumed you already had a wall but I don't think you do, your enemy just went through your village, albeit undefended, but it's the same village your general was defending earlier and he just went through without taking it. Either way, I just took another look and it seems he's got a horde of soldiers probably ready to be dispatched, your allies need to step in. The way things stand, I don't see him getting anywhere near going bankrupt, so you and your allies need to hold him off hoping he kicks the bucket.</p>

                <p>In my last game, when I was still around 30 (at Viscount), I was attacked by a far away Duke and a closer Viscount. I fended them off by trade locks. I let them take my closest villages by putting just 1 soldier there, then attack their only connecting village, locking their generals in my territory. Viscount went bankrupt soon and the Duke attacked my capital, but was held off by my constant supply of ballistas and not long later went bankrupt.</p><p>That Duke and Viscount couldn't survive long-term (24hr+) trade locks.
