                So I remember long time ago someone brought this up, it's not my idea, but I thought it over and I came up with a suggestion on how I think this could work very nicely. Any other ideas, please <img src="http://data.muxxu.com/img/icons/forum_smile.gif"><br><br>Training building: hospital<br>Building requirements: gold, cotton and metal (for the equipment? lol)<br>Training requirements: cotton and metal (you know.. bandages, stitches, nails etc.)<br><br>Medical units have a very small health, say like 1/3 of that of a soldier and with no bonus. They are used in battles not to fight but to stay back in the group and heal injured units, except machines (catapults and ballistas). However as in any real war, casualties do exist so a medical unit could also be dragged into a duel. If this happens, since his health is only 1/3 of a soldier's he stands no chance (unless the other unit is already almost dead).<br><br>So you can train a soldier to become a medical unit and you can have as many as you can. You can also bring to a battle as many as you want. Each medical unit you bring to a battle can heal by 1% the health of all injured units that return from their duels. If you have 2 medical units in the battle, then injured units that return from their duels are healed by 2%, with 3 medical units 3%, with 5 of them 5% and so on.<br><br>However the more medical units you bring in a battle, the better the chance they are engaged in a duel and you don't want this. So there you have your restriction; you can't have too many medical units in a rather small army in a given battle, because you'd waste them. So for example if you bring 20 of those in a battle where your army is 40 units, that won't be too smart because you realise there is very good chance that they'll get dragged into a duel.<br><br>For their training requirements, we could make it very costly to train, say like 30 cotton 30 metal for level 1, then -5 for each next level, so one more reason to carefully choose how many you bring in a battle. Medical units cannot heal themselves, or others of their kind.

                Perhaps I raised the training cost too much and you'd rather train more soldiers to something else even if you lose them in a battle, than consuming resources to keep your current troops alive. So maybe a lower training cost would be better. Anyhow, if this thread has any chance whatsoever of actually being read by those in charge, I just presented a general concept of how this could be done. Making some changes is easy.

                I think the benefits for having the medical are outweighed too much by the disadvantages.  I would suggest a few revisions to the medical unit.  I would change life to be half that of a basic soldier and the healing ability to ten percent of the total of other troop type's health bars per medic.  If you have two medics, the percentage is 20 and so on.<br><br>I would suggest if you have a high cost to produce a medic, then the benefits of having one should be significant in order to make them more valuable.  I think with the benefits they offer as is, they are simply not worth the expense of training one.  If you go with the 30 cotton and 30 metal to train just one, it would require 300 of each resource to train ten.  At level five, it's still a whopping 100 of each resource to make ten.

                You all do realize that when you have a battle it works as follows:<br><br>I'm quoting <strong>galeru</strong> from an old thread, but since its SO hilarious it has to be reposted!<br><br><cite>When you see a battle, do you guys ever wonder what would it look like if it was real people there? I do, and I think it would be something like this:<br><br>For example, an army of 100 attacking a village (called Random-stupid-name-town) with 2 soldiers.<br><br>Colonel: Look, sir - only 2 soldiers are defending. This village and its cotton field will be ours in no time.<br>General: Right you are, colonel! MEN! GET READY FOR ACTION!! Soldiers Ralph and Kenny, attack them, NOW!<br>Jim the mounted knight: What about the rest of us, sir?<br>General: The rest? Well, we will stand here and do absolutely nothing, of course.<br>Colonel: Uh... But sir, if we all attack them we could run over them in a few seconds... This could take, like, an hour...<br>General: WHAT!! ARE YOU QUESTIONING MY STRATEGY!?!?<br>Colonel: No, sir, um... Sorry sir.<br>Jim: General, why didn't you sent me? I am specialized to fight soldiers.<br>General: THAT'S NONSENSE!! I can't do that!! I just call out names randomly, and that ones are the ones to fight.<br>Jim: But that doesn't make any sense. Ralph and Kenny could get killed, while I would defeat both enemies easily...<br>General: SILENCE!! Spare me! You youngsters and your... unorthodox ways...<br>Jim: Can we at least cheer them on?<br>General: Didn't you hear my orders?!?! We just stand HERE like a bunch of RETARDS!! Is that so hard to understand?!<br><br>an hour later, the duels are still going...<br><br>Colonel: Sir, maybe we should go help, if we had attacked all at once an hour ago, we would be back home by now. The men are getting tired and bored... And do they really have to stand this close together? Its really crowded in there, and Jerry is claustrophobic, he could get a heart attack... And why are they fighting like this, it's like they're... chest bumping each other or something... they should use their swords more...<br>General: HUH, what are talking about!?!? Do you know any BETTER way of doing battle!?!?<br>Colonel: Well...<br>General: OF COURSE YOU DON'T!! Just as I thought...<br><br>couple of minutes later, the battle was over (and, of course, Kenny got killed )<br><br>General: Well done, men!! I got new orders from the HQ, 98 of you are going to stay here, sitting on your asses. And uh... JERRY!! You're coming with me.<br>Jerry: Yes, sir! Uh... hmm... Something is wrong, I suddenly stopped getting paid..</cite><br><br>So when you've got a medicinal unit...<br>Well you get the picture right?<br>I do hope <strong>galeru</strong> would care to explain this for me <img src="http://data.muxxu.com/img/icons/forum_happy.gif">

                Yeah that story cracked me up it was hilarious. But I don't think you've actually read my post maybe you read the first couple sentences. If you read the first 3 paragraphs after "training requirements" I'm explaining everything. The randomness of duels is in fact what my plan makes use of, and while that randomness is indeed very silly I think nobody reasonable would argue, it still brings a very nice restriction to having these medical units and makes you consider and work for the balance you need to preserve between them and the rest of units; the  percentage of medical opposed to your others and the amount and type of your opponent's, is what maximises their effect and minimises their casualties, which is what you want. Otherwise if there was no randomness working for my plan then you wouldn't have a restriction and you'd be able to bring like 100 of these units in a 10-man fight, which means you'd never lose.<br><br>Randomness sucks, but for my plan it's actually they key and a necessary restriction.

                Yeah you're right, I read the first few lines and thought of this post <img src="http://data.muxxu.com/img/icons/forum_smile.gif"><br><br>I do see your point, but the chance of a medic being sent into battle, when your army is less then 30, is quite high...<br>And lets face it, most of the time your armies are that small and by the time you get to build big armies a few more dead don't really matter...

                What if you bring 3 medics alongside the 30 troops? It's your call how many medics you bring that's the key, can't have too many because you'd probably lose a lot. Even 3 medics could save some units' ass because the very small health they'll provide to injured troops after their duels can be enough to make them survive a 2nd duel even if it's barely. The more medics the higher their efficiency but like I said, it's not in your best interest to have too many in a small army.<br><br>Anyway, I think medics could be an important unit in your battles. Hey.. at least more important than some of the existing units like for instance mounted knights. 100% bonus against soldiers wow that's a sick bonus! Funny when they get to fight ANY other unit.. And let me think, oh wait.. catapults/ballistas have 200% and many times they're even easier to make like when you're lacking horses and metal, and their bonus applies to all units except mtd archers not only against the mighty soldiers.<br><br>At least that's how I see it nobody is forced to agree. And btw even mounted knights could prove themselves handy in some occasions they aren't completely useless (although they are if you can replace them with cats/bals), I'm just saying medics could be just as important as other units, if not more.<br><br>Anyway I doubt anyone in the programming team reads suggestions let alone implement any, maybe bug reports at best. But every once in a while an idea pops up in my head I wanna share it even if I know it's gonna get buried under pages of threads. <img src="http://data.muxxu.com/img/icons/forum_lookup.gif">

                Thinking it through, I believe the "healing percentage based on number of medics" would be a bit overpowered.  I think it'll result in armies where every wounded unit is fully healed, making it practically unbreakable unless chance starts putting medics into the fight.  So I'd like to suggest a slight change to the proposed medic mechanics in a battle.<br><br>Instead of healing percentages depending on how many medics you bring, how about a seperate medic "duel" system?  For example: after the first few duels are completed and the wounded units return to the army, your medics then "duel" with the wounded, one medic per wounded, starting with the most wounded.  The wounded would then be healed at the same rate a soldier would cause damage.  When the next wave of wounded comes in, the medics may move on to them even if the unit they're currently treating isn't at full health because they give priority to the most wounded.<br><br>This way, bringing many medics to a battle would be beneficial as more medics = more wounded units healed at once.  But you'd have the same disadvantage before as more medics = better chance of a medic being drawn into a combat duel and they might also sit inactive if there aren't any wounded to heal.  The balancer is it would also be just as possible that an army could end up with more wounded than the medics are able to heal and they could become overwhelmed.<br><br>Another suggestion might be that regardless of treatment, a soldier won't be able to be healed back up to full health.  The logic behind it is if a knight survives a fight but, say, takes an arrow to the knee, proper treatment might get that knight back into the battle but he won't be at full capacity until the wound actually heals.  This could be simulated by putting a cap of (again, pulling numbers out of the air) only 75% of damage inflicted on a unit can be healed.<br><br>Just a few ideas I had.
