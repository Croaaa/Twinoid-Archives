                <p>I found the help section to be missing a lot when I was starting out, so I have made my own How to Play guide for this game, with lots of details and advanced strategies i have learned playing the game. Comments and suggestions are welcome.</p><br><br><p>What the game is about :</p><br><p>You earn money and fame by renting out rooms and satisfying clients. In general, the more satisfied they are, the more money you make.</p><br><br><p>Clients :</p><br><p>Have a base satisfaction, usually 3, but can be less or more, under certain circumstances.VIP’s start 2 lower than normal, but you will get 2 satisfaction if their room is fancy enough. Research can raise some client types base satisfaction, guests with higher satisfaction will pay more, and be less likely to damage the room.</p><br><p>Likes or dislikes: Each client has two, and they could be either type. having a like, or not having a dislike gives +2 satisfaction. Not having a like, or having a dislike gives -3 satisfaction. You can have several of the same like for +2 each.</p><br><p>Effects. Each client usually has one, unless they have a special trait for their monster type. These effects are felt in every room directly touching their room, left and right side, and above and below, if there are rooms there.</p><br><br><p>Types of clients.</p><br><p>There are 13 types of clients, and you unlock different types as your level increases</p><br><p>Suspicious Package : A creature type only sent by a friend to your motel directly. They pay no money and only stay one night, but they can have their likes and dislikes set to any type and create any effect your friend chooses, so they can be used to make other guests happy. They are especially useful for a new hotel, so make sure to ask for what you need on the forums before midnight, if you are missing some effect to make other guests happy. Always ask for Likes Neighbors, its the easiest need to meet, and you can use otherwise almost useless teddy bears on them. These guests give fame as normal, and unlock special twinoid titles when they check out with 10 satisfaction.</p><br><p>Bhoring Witch : It has no unique properties. Basic guest type</p><br><p>Capitalist : They have an increased chance to leave behind something at checkout. This is a good way to get bonus items, their satisfaction plays no role in the effect. Basic guest type</p><br><p>Pyromaniac : They always destroy the room and all equipment installed at checkout. The cost of this effect can be limited by certain techs, and if they stay multiple nights. A good strategy is to use the fireworks equipment with them and no other equipment, because the damage this causes would likely happen anyway, and they would break anything else used. Best put in a level 1 room if they are not a VIP, because the cost of repair is much higher in a deluxe room. Basic guest type.</p><br><p>Abomination : They give a research bonus (40% total) when sacrificed to the institute of happiness. This only happens if your research is not at 80% complete. You might as well wait till you get these before upping your research, if possible, as it will go faster. Level 3 guest</p><br><p>Jovial Zombie : They make everyone surrounding their room +1 satisfaction, on top of any other effect. When centrally placed, these guests can rapidly increase the total satisfaction of many other guests at the same time, and are usually worth putting in a room, even if they are not very satisfied themselves. Level 3 guest.</p><br><p>Hypno-cat : If their starting satisfaction is 8 or more when they are first placed in a room, another guest immediately arrives at your hotel. This can happen if you base satisfy their likes/dislikes, and meet a like twice, or if you put them near zombies. Store items pre-placed in their room can also help trigger this, and you can move them later and keep the bonus guest. If you have the rooms empty, this is a very powerful effect, as it lets you exceed the normal limits on guests, and you could receive another Hypno-cat from the effect ! Level 4 guest.</p><br><p>Potless Blob : They only pay 50% of what other guests pay, unless their satisfaction is 10, then they pay 170% of the normal rate. Research can increase their base starting satisfaction, and is a good investment. Level 4 guest.</p><br><p>Dumb Fish : Takes 3 hours longer for your employees to give them tokens of appreciation. I usually don’t bother giving the tokens to this client type. They are fine otherwise. This guest pays the most per night, if their tech is upgraded. Level 4 guest.</p><br><p>Hysterical : This monster lowers all guests satisfaction by 3, if it is ever less than 5 satisfaction itself. This is a very dangerous guest type to have in your hotel, as unforeseen events or misplacement can catastrophically lower your satisfaction hotel-wide, and if you have two and one goes bad, they can piss off each other, and keep everyone at 0 satisfaction, trashing your hotel at checkout. A trip to the institute of happiness can be a good way to deal with trouble from this guest. Research can increase this guests base satisfaction rating, and is a VERY good investment, if you ever handle this type of guest. Level 5 guest.</p><br><p>Monstro-Plant : This monster has two effects it gives off. This is more often than not a disadvantage, but might be useful for the right guest likes. This guest pays the most per night, if their tech is upgraded. Level 5 guest.</p><br><p>Ghost : Gives off no effect, and does not count as a neighbor. This is a good ‘spacer’ guest to put between guests with lots of dislikes and other guests. Level 6 guest.</p><br><p>Emotional Bomb : This guest explodes after 3 hours if it ever reaches 0 or 10 satisfaction, destroying the room. They also disappear so you will get no more payout from them. The payout of this guest type can be improved with research. Level 7 guest.</p>

                <p>Employees</p><br><p>They are recruited at the supermarket link. They are used to repair damaged rooms, give tokens of appreciation to guests (cost, speed and success rate of this can be improved with research), and they speed up the arrival of new guests when placed at the front desk, up to six employees. Being at the desk is their most important task, although repairs are also vital. More staff at the desk is the BEST way to get more guests, as you only pay for the staff and desk space once, until you bequeath your hotel. Make sure to return them to the desk after any task during the guest arrival times, 6 AM to Midnight. No guests arrive between Midnight and 6 AM, so this is an ideal time to give tokens of appreciation, assuming you can be online to return them to the desk at around 6 AM (game time) If you decide to pay real money on this game, employee 5 and 6 are where you will want to spend it first, once you have a decent number of rooms. More employees at the desk is the most effective and efficient way to get more guests, up to 24 free guests per day, with 6 employees at the desk.</p><br><br><p>Tax</p><br><p>A CroquEuro tax is due every week at Sunday midnight, and is based on your level, and when your hotel was started for the first level. Research can lower the cost of the tax. Paying this is very important for your hotel, at least until you reach level 7, as each level gives you new guest types and room types, and certain levels are needed for bequeathing, and leveling up can only be done this way, and only once a week in real time. There is no effect if you cannot pay it, but it will be automatically paid if you can pay it when its due. Don’t miss out on this, or you will have to wait another week to gain a level. I like to have the money ready, so random events can’t cause me to miss this. If you can get your cash balance below 300, the consortium will bring you up to 300 at tax time. Since your balance includes the nighty payment, you are unlikely to get this when you are not sacrificing all your guests to the institute. I find it useful to stay at level four for a while, since it maximizes the number of hypnocats you get (by not adding the other monster types)</p><br><br><p>Equipment</p><br><p>There are 3 types: Decorations do nothing gameplay wise, but change the look of your hotel. Special items can give satisfaction bonuses or other effects. Some of these are destroyed on use. Store items create an effect in the room they are placed in. The items that are not destroyed on use might be destroyed when the guest leaves. The tech to strengthen the room items is a great investment, as is the tech that increases the chances of having an item left by clients. You can put up to two non-instant items in a room.</p><br><br><p>Building onto your hotel</p><br><p>The expand icon lets you build additions to your hotel. These start at 0 cost, and increase generally with each piece. The cost can be reduced with a tech, and i recommend this tech, unless you are bequeathing with 20 rooms or less. Space on the first floor cannot be used for hotel rooms for guests, so i recommend not building additions there. You do not need a lobby or first floor, either to hold the guests that are waiting for rooms, or to support the hotel structurally. There are three types of things that can be built in each space, by clicking on an empty or in-use space, the list will appear. Building a guest room over something else will create a trashed room. Guest rooms are for putting your guests. Room services rooms (like laundromatrix) are for generating and satisfying room service requests. These rooms appear in green on the build list. Guests will not make such requests until at least one room that can satisfy the request has been built, and the requests are random. Each room service request met counts as a +1 satisfaction token of appreciation, and lasts until that guest checks out. Each request takes 30 minutes of room time, and gives the +1 satisfaction instantly. These rooms require the player to activate them, so they give you more to do in the game, and the bonuses stack, so they are well worth it. I recommend building one of each, as soon as they are available. Special rooms serve the likes of your guests. These room types are purple on the list. These rooms do not create an effect (disco does not make noise, etc), and do not affect guest satisfaction. Each visit takes 2 hours and makes you 5 CroquEuros. A guest will not return to that room for a second visit for at least 6 hours after visiting. This is passive, and requires no effort on the players part. These rooms increase in cost as more are added, and take a while to pay for themselves and start to make money. These rooms are not a good addition, unless you have a lot of time before your next bequeath, so they can earn back their cost.</p><br><br><p>Fame</p><br><p>Little red stars, the counter is right over your money. It cannot be spent, and cannot be lost. You get them from VIP guests, leveling up, expanding your hotel, upgrading rooms, max satisfaction normal guests at checkout, and some other things. It has no effect in the game, just bragging rights. The fastest way to get it is getting VIP guests to 10 satisfaction on their checkout. Not really worth paying ad campaigns for the VIP guests, in my opinion, but if you get a VIP naturally, might as well get the stars. A well-run hotel should make a fair amount of fame, just from normal 10 satisfaction guests and upgrades.</p><br><br><p>VIP Clients</p><br><p>These are special guests that make more fame, and pay more per night. They appear at random, or if you buy certain ad campaigns or complete quests. Any monster type can be a VIP, and they can appear as VIP from a random event after placing them, which can be bad, if you have mostly normal rooms, because they need a deluxe room. At level 3, they demand a level 2 upgraded room or they will be upset. They have a halo around their body, and their description identifies them as VIP. You will always get fame if they are over 0 satisfaction, but you will get much more fame at level 10 satisfaction. They start with 2 less satisfaction than normal guests of their type, but you get +2 satisfaction for putting them in a deluxe room, so the net effect is normal satisfaction for their monster type, if they are in the right deluxe room.</p><br><br><p>Bequeath your hotel</p><br><p>When you meet certain requirements in your office, you can bequeath your hotel to an employee. This lets you start over your game, and gets you some fame, a star in your hotel’s name, maybe a twinoid title, a new set of ad campaigns, 5 more maximum science points, and lets you rebuild your hotel with only the single square of the lobby desk set (which means you can rebuild without a first floor) You only keep items still in your inventory, your money, and one employee. You start at level 2, and also get a few ‘easy’ guests that like neighbors, and maybe some lab points. Best done on a Saturday right after 10 AM checkout, so you get your last checkout payments, and you can level up to 3 right away, and not be stuck with the base 3 guest types. My personal experience is that the ad campaigns of a never-bequeathed hotel are the cheapest you will ever have per guest, so if the titles and stars don’t interest you, you can spend your limited lab points very carefully, and have a ton of cheap guests every day in a zero star hotel, depending on your starter ad campaigns.</p>

                <p>I structured this like the existing help section, but it needs a basic strategy section.</p><br><p>Basic Strategy:</p><br><p>Build all the hotel extension segments that cost 0 Croqueuros, do not expand the first floor at first, because you cannot build guest rooms there, and you do not need a lobby of any particular size. Bring in as many 'free' guests as possible and give them rooms near the effects they like, and not next to the stuff they hate, to make Croqueuros to develop your hotel. By free guests, i mean the guests that naturally show up at the hotel, not the ones you buy with ad campaigns and with tokens. The best way to get more guests early on is to get four employees, expand the desk so they can all be put there, then put them all there from about 7:00 till 22:00 game time, to attract more guests to your hotel. No one arrives normally between 24:00 and 6:00, and you can tell when you have all of the day's guests because the next guest counter at the front door of your hotel reads 6:00. When that happens, you could use your employees for other things, as long as you can be online to get them back to the desk by 7:00 to 8:00 game time, to bring in the next day's free guests. You do not have to be at the desk immediately at 6:00, because the first guest always arrives at 6:00, even if you have no one at the desk, and there is some lag before the next one can be brought in, 2 hours for 4 employees at the desk, and you will trigger the second guest at 8:00, if the four employees get to the front desk by 8:00.</p><br><p>Employees should repair all damaged rooms after 10:00 checkout, when the rooms are empty. Make sure to put the employees back at the desk when the rooms are repaired.</p><br><p>You will also want to build enough basic rooms to accommodate all the normal guests you can bring in daily. This should be done after getting the employees and desk space, because there is no penalty to having extra guests you do not use, and having more guests makes it more likely these guests will have the natural effects you need to meet each other's likes requests. Do not build other non-guest rooms, or upgrade rooms, until you have enough basic rooms for all your free guests. The extra money the special rooms can make is related to the number of guests your hotel has at any one time, so getting all your guests in rooms should come first, then you can start earning auxiliary income off them with the special rooms, once you have all your free guests in rooms. As your level increases, you will start to get multi-day guests, and then you will need more basic rooms, because these multi-day guests will still be in your hotel when the next day's guests arrive.</p>
