                <p>Research points come from bequeathing, and completing quests, but mostly from sacrificing guests in an institute of happiness. The total research points is limited by the number of bequeaths you have made. There are four levels, and each level requires 4 points put into the level below it before it unlocks. You cannot have every tech, until you bequeath five times, so some careful choosing is required. You can reset your techs for 20 tokens, but its much easier to either plan ahead or bequeath. Bequeathing your hotel erases all your tech choices, so you have lots of potential do overs if you plan to bequeath. The first bequeaths come very fast, so I suggest not researching anything not for a quest until you have done two bequeaths, since it takes several days of guest sacrificing to get all the techs, just to have to start over relatively soon.</p><br><br><p>Level 1</p><br><p>Cheap Love 0/3: Lowers the cost of using employees to give tokens of appreciation from 10 to 4 Croqueuros each. There are three techs related to these tokens.</p><br><p>Nomadic Pleasure 0/1: Lowers the satisfaction penalty for moving a guest from 2 to 1 point. Some players do not care for this, but I consider it a must have. It makes it less costly to fix a placement mistake, and it lets you take advantage of the game mechanics easier. It can be very useful to move guests around after some depart at 10 AM, It can save one use equipment by moving out guests before checkout, it can help with triggering hypno-cats, and you can move a multi-day guest after midnight to maximise the satisfaction of a guest who checks out at 10 AM that day, then move them back. I would use this to unlock the level 2 techs</p><br><p>DIY-guys 0/3: Lowers the cost of repairing a room by ½, if you have all three levels. Some rooms that a guest checks out of will require room repair, pyromaniac guests destroy rooms, some items and builds damage rooms, and random events will cause damage. Damage to a room lowers guest satisfaction, and is not too expensive to fix, so rooms should always be repaired when empty. At level 3, this tech saves 3 Croqueuros per level of damage repaired on a normal level room. Damaged rooms are unavoidable, and you will likely have some damage every day, if any guests are checking out. This saves you money every day, and improves profit margins, so i consider this a must have, all three levels, and would use this to unlock level 2 techs.</p><br><p>Job’s a good ‘un 0/3: Lowers the time of giving a token of appreciation from 4 to 2 hours when fully upgraded. There are three techs related to these tokens.</p>

                <p>Level 2</p><br><p>Armour Plating 0/3: Lowers the chance of a client destroying a room. I assume this is checkout damage only. because that is the only time i have seen a client damage a room. I do not know if this affects the normal damage of Pyromaniacs, i will have to test this (by not getting the Mastery: Pyromaniacs tech, and monitoring the rooms of Pyromaniacs after checkout) I have my own suggestion about minimizing this damage. Do not let guests check out of your hotel with 0 satisfaction. Guests of any type will completely trash (5 levels of damage) a room if they are at 0 or less satisfaction at checkout, just like Pyromaniacs do. All guests have a chance of doing one level of damage to a room at checkout, and I believe this reduces that chance. Assuming you have DIY-guys tech, the cost of one level of normal damage is minimal (relative to the checkout payments for 7 satisfaction guests), so i consider this a lesser tech, but it does save some small amount of money every day.</p><br><p>Crystal Ball 0/1: Lets you know when the next room service request will be made. This can be useful with Blobs, since you really need that last satisfaction point before midnight or checkout. This is a marginal tech, since the room service requests are fairly predictable. You can normally expect one request from every guest that is placed earlier in the day, and about 50% chance of a room service request from a guest placed later in the day. Most players skip this. It takes lots of micromanagement to use this effectively.</p><br><p>Mad Architect 0/3: Lowers the cost of adding extensions to your hotel. At max level, it saves 20% of the cost of each extension. Every room type you can add to your hotel needs space, the higher level bequeaths need a lot of space built, and the cost of each piece increases as the amount of total space increases. Hotels going over 20 spaces will save a LOT of money over time with this tech, so I consider it a must have, all three levels, and would use this to unlock level 3</p><br><p>Padded Cell 0/3: This reduces the chance that a guest sacrificed to an institute of happiness will lower the satisfaction of the other guests. This upset effect of sacrificing guests is devastating on a full hotel. The more guests and waiting guests at the hotel, the more massive the effect. This can wipe out all your efforts to satisfy your guests, and cause current guests to trash all your rooms at checkout. I do not believe this tech lowers the chances of upsets to 0%, and I have no interest in taking risks like this. My personal strategy is to build two institutes right after a bequeath, level my hotel to level 3 (for Abominations and their lab bonus), and then send every guest to the institutes, every day, until I have all the techs I want, then i replace the institutes and play without them. Since there is only so much tech you can ever earn, doing it all at once makes a lot of sense, and lets you ditch the institutes, and recover valuable space in your hotel for guests or satisfying guests. If you choose to do this, the padded cell is a completely worthless tech, so I avoid it. If you choose to run your hotel with guests and an institute, and make sacrifices at the same time, this tech can save huge amounts of money, so it would be worth having.</p><br><p>Doctor Feelgood 0/3: Improves the odds of a token of appreciation making a client happier. There are three techs related to these tokens. You should consider all three as a unit, and if you want to pursue this strategy at all.</p><br><p>These tokens are usually not profitable to give without the upgrades, and you will usually only do them between around 11 PM and 7 AM game time, so your employees can be at the desk during the time when new guests could be brought in faster, so you should consider if you can be online to do this, as the employees need to be manually started on this, then put back at the desk before the next guest arrival time. These tokens are however very useful for getting fame, and for VIP’s and Blobs, which you will want to get to 10 satisfaction if possible. They can also be profitable for two and three day guests, since they will increase a lot of future payouts, and you can stack them for more effect (like the room service effects) If you have no interest in fame, you can increase satisfaction much cheaper with the room service rooms, and still make similar money as a heavy token giver most of the time.</p><br><p>Of the three, i consider Cheap Love to be the most important. Succeed or fail, each try costs 10 Croqueuros, and at that cost you will usually lose money on them, even if you get the effect. Bringing them down to 4 Croqueuros makes them much more viable, but still marginal. profit wise.</p><br><p>I consider Doctor Feelgood to be the second best. The chances of success at base level are not that good. I’d guess 40%. At level 3, its 80%. You can usually make money on them with both a cost of 4, and an 80% chance of success, assuming you don’t go over 10 satisfaction (although that can provide a margin of safety)</p><br><p>I consider Job’s a good ‘un to be the least useful, because it lets you make more tries faster, and without the other two, you would be losing money very fast giving 3-4 out per employee per night at full cost will low success. Also, this requires you to be online a lot between around 11 PM and 7 AM game time to fully use this tech, as each employee has to be manually re-assigned after each gift, to be able to give more tokens per night.</p><br><p>However, if you can be online, with all three techs upgraded and the tokens going out fast, you can get a lot of fame and some extra cash, by getting most guests to 10 satisfaction before checkout. I consider this tech set to be marginal, because you can get a similar effect at no additional cost (over the initial cost of the room service rooms), and 100% success rate, by meeting room service requests, and you have a larger time window to meet them, and you can do more per day, assuming you have a lot of guests.</p><br><p>One point in Cheap Love or Armor Plating gets you to level 3</p>

                <p>Level 3</p><br><p>Mastery: Blobs 0/2: Adds one base level of satisfaction to all future blobs per point. I consider this a must have, because it makes it much easier to get to 10 satisfaction for blobs, and they pay 65 Croqueuros more per night and checkout at 10 satisfaction, versus 9 satisfaction. Big money maker.</p><br><p>Mastery: Pyromaniacs 0/2: Reduces the chances of Pyromaniacs destroying the room at checkout. I would guess this reduces the chances to 50%, but I would have to test this. This will save money by avoiding repairs, but not as much as any other mastery tech, and Pyromaniacs are still the worst guests, even with this tech, so i consider it marginal.</p><br><p>Mastery: Bombs 0/2: Each level adds 50% to the payout of Bombs. You cannot get the 10 satisfaction payout normally, because they will explode if they hit that level, but at level 9, they pay much more than most other guests at level 10 satisfaction. If you do not raise your hotel to level 7 this is marginal, otherwise its a must have. Big money maker.</p><br><p>Mastery: Fish 0/2: Each level adds 50% to the payout of Dumb Fish. This tech makes this guest hugely profitable, the equal of two normal guests. You should level your hotel to level 4 for the Hypno-cats, and you will get this guest at that level, so this is a must have tech. Big money maker.</p><br><p>Mastery: Hysterical 0/2: Adds one base level of satisfaction to all future Hystericals per point. This is a very dangerous guest type, as it can ruin the satisfaction hotel wide. This tech makes them safer, but still not safe. It also earns you more cash for this guest type. If you will reach level 5, and will put this guest in your hotel, then this is a must have. If you intend to stay at level 4, I would still consider this a must have, because you might accidentally level, and then you may have to deal with this guest at some point, and its just too dangerous not to have every edge for dealing with it.</p><br><p>Mastery: Plants 0/2: Each level adds 50% to the payout of Monstro Plants. This tech makes this guest hugely profitable, the equal of two normal guests. You will probably level your hotel to level 5 for bequeathing, if nothing else, and you will get this guest at that level, so this is pretty much a must have tech. Big money maker.</p><br><p>You shouldn’t have any problem getting four points spent at level 3, as there are so many must have techs here.</p>

                <p>Level 4</p><br><p>Toughened Equipment 0/2: This reduces the chances that non-one-use equipment is destroyed by a guest at checkout. I would guess the chances of destruction are around 60% if you don’t have this, and about 30% if you do. The equipment basically solves any guest problems, and you will get some installable equipment, even if you don’t buy it with real money, so you might as well protect it as best you can. I don’t know if this works with Pyromaniacs, but I have a lot of Teddy Bears here, so I’ll test it. This is a must have tech, IMO.</p><br><p>Racket 0/3: This increases the chances of a guest leaving something behind at checkout. I would guess the normal odds of getting something are around 15%, and around 40% with this. Guests check out all the time, this stuff is usually useful, must have tech.</p><br><p>In Your Sky 0/3: Reduces your tax payment by 1/15 th each level. Sounds awesome, but you can avoid paying the tax if you want, and this makes avoidance slightly harder by reducing the levy, and, assuming you are level 3 when you earn this tech, if you only go to level 7, your total savings is capped at 1500 Croqueuros. Marginal tech, but if you plan to level higher than 7 (there are no benefits beyond fame to do this) you will save a lot of money, as the rate keeps increasing each week.</p><br><p>Good Taste 0/3: Enables you to earn decorations, at a low rate, from sacrifices at the institute. These don’t do anything in the game, so its a marginal tech. If you really want these decorations, then you should put points into this as soon as you can, so you can start racking up the decorations while you get the remaining techs. There is a small chance of a guest leaving a decoration behind at checkout, so you will eventually get these naturally without this tech. Also, do all the starter quests, they also give decorations (but don’t use them, till you get the easy bequeaths done, cause you lose all of the decorations you have used, when you bequeath)</p>
