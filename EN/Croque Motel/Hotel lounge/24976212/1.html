The most common extra in a hotel are 'effect rooms'. They work, and require no effort, but a satisfied guest in an upgraded room always pays more per day than an effect room, and potentially a lot more. To best use from one to a single set of five different effect rooms, you need about 20 guests in rooms, to hopefully cover all the different likes. Guests with two dislikes never use them, and even with all this, you will only get about 50 <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico"> per room per day, assuming 10 Two hour visits a day. A single one day, high payout guest, in an upgraded room at 10 satisfaction could yield over 300 <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico"> <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/eek.png" alt=":tid_eek:" class="tid_ico"></p><br><p>But how realistic is that potential high guest payout ? Out of my 60 guests, I currently have EIGHT one-day high payout Monstro Plants and Dumb Fish, in upgraded rooms, at 10 satisfaction, and I expect to make 320 <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico"> from each of them !!

You need what its tech does to make more money, but you don't really need the institute itself. You can only get so much tech for each star level, so you might as well get all the tech as fast as possible, then ditch the institute(s), and reclaim the space for paying guests. You can still kill guests after you have all the tech, to complete the repeating quests, and to make a little money, but you make way more money, and stars, by having satisfied guests leaving your hotel, and even with padded cell tech level 3, you will have few level 10 satisfied guests if you are using an institute, and if you are no longer using it, why have it taking up a space that could potentially have a paying guest ?</p>

                <p>How can you best get lots of guests in your hotel ?</p><br><p>The best way is to put more employees at the front desk, between 6 AM and 00 AM. You can get the first 4 employees with <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico">, and 2 more with Tokens. You can get even more employees, but only the first 6 can bring in more guests. This also requires expansion of the front desk.</p><br><p>Staying at level 4 can also bring in more guests, from the power of the Hypno-cat guests. By staying at level 4, you will bring in the maximum number of Hypno-cats and Jovial Zombies, 12.5 % chance of each (the zombies help activate the cats). By carefully placing the Hypno-cats, you can usually activate their power and get an extra guest from each cat.</p><br><p>Campaigns can be purchased every day for <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico">. The cost of each guest is random to some extent, but it stays constant between bequeaths. Because you only net what you make over the cost of the campaigns, you should also upgrade your rooms, so you can still make good money on your guests you paid to bring in. You should also have enough guest rooms for any guests from campaigns, so you can earn your money back on them.</p><br><p>You can spend tokens to bring in guests directly, but the employees 5 and 6 are much better cost per guest, and they can always bring in more guests every day. If you have paid tokens in your account, you can accidentally summon guests if you hit the Attract a Guest link on the main hotel screen, and there is no "are you sure" popup, so avoid clicking in that area or while the page is loading, if you have tokens.</p>

                <p>How can you best place guests in your hotel for maximum satisfaction ?</p><br><p>The most important thing is to get all the five effects 'naturally', basically from other guests. The easiest way to do this is step one, bringing in the most guests you can place in your hotel. Each non-Ghost guest will come with an effect. The effect is random, but the more guests you get, the more likely that you will get all of the effects. By having multiple guests with each effect, it makes it possible to win the meat of this game, the puzzle aspect of placing guests together, so they are all near their likes, and away from their dislikes. If you place a normal guest near two of the same 'like', and meet their other like/dislike, you will get them to 9 satisfaction, and be only one point from that guest's maximum <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico"> and <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/fame.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okvip_25:" class="tid_ico"> payout.</p><br><p>The second best way to get all the effects naturally is to be at least level 4. Level 4 is the first level in which you get Hypno-cats and three day guests. The Hypno-cats are the best guest type in the game, properly activated, they are so good the designers secretly nerfed them so you cannot normally get a second Hypno-cat from placing a Hypno-cat well. They get you more guests and more effects, without any cost, when they are placed right. The two and three day guests also get you more effects, and protect you from getting a really bad run of guests with the same effect, because they stick around and give you some of the effects that you had the previous day. Multi-day guests pay less per day (because one day guests or guests on their last day pay twice), but if you have enough room, they usually increase your hotel-wide earnings, by getting more guests to maximum satisfaction. The only reason to ever play below level 4 is if you are sacrificing most of your guests for tech. If you are doing that, level 3 is best, because 20% of all your guests will be Abominations, and you can maximize their double science special ability.</p><br><p>Playing at level 5 will also help generate all of the effects, because it is the first level in which you get Monstro-plants. They are the second best guest type in the game, both because they can pay double with the right techs, but also because they come with two effects. This is actually better than it seems, because they also never have the same effect twice, so you are much more likely to get any effect you need, because they each have two of the five effects.</p><br><p>You can request a guest from a friend that has any effect and likes/dislikes you need. This can be critical for a small hotel, when you can easily have none of an effect you need. This guest does not pay <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico"> directly, but can still give you a <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/fame.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okvip_25:" class="tid_ico">, and can make a lot of <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico"> from other guests that it makes happy by being near them. This guest should always have two likes, one of which should be neighbors. This guest is useless away from other guests, so plan a place for them near others that need an effect. You can request this guest type on the forums, and the sender only has to add you to their contacts to send one of these guests. It is customary to send a guest to someone that sends you one, but it is not necessary.</p><br><p>An important part of getting maximum natural satisfaction is placing the right guests together. 'Liker' guests with two likes should usually be placed in the center of your hotel, where they can have 4 neighbors. Since they can only be upset by a lack of effects, you can place any other guest next to them without upsetting them, and you will have more possible places you can place other guests with the effects they like. 'Haters' with two dislikes, should usually be placed near an outer edge of your hotel, so they have less neighbors, and less chance of being near an effect they dislike.</p>

They add +6 satisfaction, and do 3 levels of room damage. You will not need to repair the room until the guest leaves, if +3 net satisfaction is enough.

Focus first on the effect that you have the least amount of monsters generating. This is where you are likely to have the least flexibility, especially if you have a lot of guests that like that effect. In addition, try to take note of monsters that like what they generate. That could reduce your flexibility, especially if you don't have a lot of monsters that emit the effect in question. Also, try to pair guests that can fulfill each other's likes. For example, if you have a guest that likes noise and generates food and another guest that likes food and generates noise, try to put these guests together.</p><p>If you have at least two guests that like the same two effects, see if you can create a 2x2 square of guests where two diagonal corners are those two guests and the other corners are guests that fulfill those likes without reducing satisfaction of other guests.</p>

                <p>How can you get your guests as satisfied as you can before checkout ?</p><br><p>Once your guests are placed, the easiest and cheapest way to increase satisfaction is with room services. Once you reach level 2, guests will leave room service requests outside their doors, these glow yellow and red. Each room service room you build can fulfill one of these room service request types that matches that room service room, every 30 minutes, but unlike the effect rooms, you have to fulfill the request yourself manually by clicking on it. You can build more than one of each type of room service room, and I usually do. The number you need depends on the number of guests you have and placed today, and the amount of time you will devote to this game throughout the day. I have one room service room per 7 guests. Every guest placed before 16:00 will always make a room service request in 1 to 12 hours after being placed. If a guest stays long enough, they will make a second request 12 to 24 hours after you fulfill the first request. On average, you will get about 1 request per day a guest stays, so a guest with 2 dislikes who stays 3 days can be upped from 7 to 10 satisfaction just by fulfilling three room service requests alone. Assuming most of your guests are at 7 plus satisfaction when they are all placed, these last few points of satisfaction can be worth a lot of <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico">, because all guest types pay much more as they get up to 10 satisfaction.</p>

                <p>The next best way to increase satisfaction is installing items in your guest rooms. Items can be acquired from the starter quests (zero star hotel), being left by your guests when they depart, and purchased directly with tokens. The most effective items to install are the items that create an effect your guest likes. If the effect is not currently present, this adds 5 satisfaction. If the guest already has the desired effect, adding it again adds 2 satisfaction. IMO, its usually not worth it to add a second effect with an item, unless the guest has double payout through techs, or is not easy to satisfy in other ways (Dumb Fish)</p><br><p>Welcome gifts add 1 satisfaction, if the guest has not received any tokens of appreciation yet. These are best saved for Potless Blobs, which typically come into a hotel at 9 satisfaction when you have their blob mastery tech. The difference between 9 and 10 satisfaction is HUGE for this guest, and you can radically increase their payout by up to 100 <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico"> with this item, if they will not make a room service request until after midnight.</p><br><p>Fireworks Display adds +6 satisfaction at midnight, and does 3 damage to the room. The damage upsets the guest, so the net gain is 3 satisfaction for a normal guest. VIP guests are more upset by damage to the room, so you will not gain any satisfaction with them, unless you can repair the room. If they are a multi-day guest, you can move the guest, have an employee repair the room, and move them back for a total of +5 satisfaction, but its rare that you actually need the extra satisfaction, because it cannot go higher than 10. Be aware that this costs you money in repairs, and destroys any other item installed with the fireworks, so I would say it should not be used with any other item. A good use of this item is for a Pyromaniac guest, because they will likely destroy the room anyway, so the cost to repair is less of an issue. A better use of this item is for a double payout guest at 7 satisfaction, because it makes you more <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico">, The BEST use of this item, and the only thing i use them for, is one day Dumb Fish guests with two dislikes. Because it is hard to use an employee to give this guest a token of appreciation, this is often the only sure way to get this guest to 10 satisfaction before midnight, and since they pay double with their mastery tech, this is also very profitable.</p><br><p>Repair kits can repair a damaged room, but its much cheaper to do it with your employees. The best use of this item is to fix 'event damage' to a room in which the guest cannot be moved, which is the last 10 hours before checkout. This is a rare item, so I usually save them for VIP's.</p><br><p>Diamond beds don't increase satisfaction, but they increase the midnight and checkout payments by 25%, and this thread is about making <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico">. This item is always destroyed at checkout, but there is an exploit for it. A good use of Diamond Bed is a double payout guest, a better use is a multi-day high payout guest, the BEST use is an exploit where you pair this with a Matelalala and a fully upgraded room, you put a multi-day guest in the room, then you move them out on the last day before they checkout. By doing this, you keep the guest extra happy from the matelalala, make 25% more every midnight from the Diamond Bed, and you never lose the Diamond Bed, because no one ever checks out from that room.</p><br><p>This same exploit also applies to the Isolation Chamber. This item isolates a guest room from most external effects. It DOES NOT isolate a room from an institute of happiness minor upsets, nor does it block the wailing of a Hysterical guest, even if the Hysterical is inside the chamber. What it does block is the passive +1 effect of a Zombie, and the regular effects that guests produce around them, both ways, so no effects come out of the chamber either. A good use of this item is a guest with two dislikes (hater) that cannot be fit into your hotel any other way, so it gets you their normal payout, when you otherwise would have gotten little or nothing placing them. The best use of this item is paired with an Matelalala and placed along an outer edge of your hotel, this setup not only holds a hater multi-day guest until you move them out on their last day, but also creates other long term nooks around it, where a guest can only have one or two neighbors. I use this along the bottom level of my hotel to hold lots of hater guests in and around the rooms the Isolation Chambers are installed in.</p><br><p>Matelalala gives +1 satisfaction every night a guest is in the room at midnight. A good use is for a multi-day guest with two dislikes, so the +1's can just add up over time. The best use is as part of the two exploits explained above.</p>

                <p>The last way to increase satisfaction is to have your employees give tokens of appreciation directly to your guests. This is probably the worst of the three options, because it requires you to manually place the employees, manually return them to the desk when they are done, and without the proper techs, it costs 10 <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico"> just to try, takes four hours, and has very low chance of success (about 40%). At those prices and odds, there is likely no profit in doing this, and it would only be useful for VIP's.</p><br><p>If you have the time and can be online for this (the best times are around midnight until 6 AM, when no guests can arrive), you should max out the related techs (Cheap Love, Doctor Feelgood, and Job's a good 'un) Once you have all of those, the costs to do this are 4 <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico">, 2 hours (for non-Dumb Fish), and about 70 % chance of success. At those odds you can make some money, but only if the guest is at 7 - 9 satisfaction already. This is best done on double payout guests, or guests like Blobs or VIP's, but you can also make some small coin on normal guests, and get fame stars by getting them to 10 satisfaction.</p><br><p>There is a trick that can get you the maximum payout on Emotional Timebomb guests, even though they explode at 10 satisfaction. Since it takes 3 hours for them to explode, if you give them a token of appreciation that brings them from 9 to 10 satisfaction so that it completes right after 7 AM (so you put your employee on them right after 5 AM, ( with 'Job's a good 'un' tech ), you will get their full payout and <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/fame.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okvip_25:" class="tid_ico"> and they will not explode. If you do this, you can return your employees to the desk when they complete, and not lose any guests, although if you have 6 employees, it will delay your last guest by 15 minutes to do this. If you plan things carefully, a welcome gift or an effect item can also be used for this, but using an employee can save you the item.</p>

                <p>Tweeks : Lab Techs</p><br><p>Almost all the lab techs can make you or save you money, but some are much better than others, and they all cost you money initially, because you have to kill your guests to get the lab points. Ive ranked them in order of usefulness, although some of them depend on how big you will make your hotel, or other things.</p><br><p>Mastery Bombs, Fish, Plants, Blobs, and Hystericals, all maxed.</p><br><p>These techs are huge profit generators, and probably the best for earning <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico">. The first three strait up double the payout of those guest types, at all satisfaction levels. The Blob mastery makes them 2 points happier all the time, which makes it very easy to always get their +170% payout at 10 satisfaction, which makes the tech similar to the first three, although you can get their top payout without it. The Hysterical mastery is similar to the Blob, +2 satisfaction. This gets you some extra cash, but what it really does is protect your other guests from the Hysterical, by making it much less likely that something sets them off, which can cost you a LOT of money, if they get set off right before midnight or checkout.</p><br><p>Racket 3/3</p><br><p>This tech DOUBLES the chances that a normal guest leaves an item at checkout (40 %) With this, you can just farm items from your guests, and then boost up the satisfaction and payouts of the next guests with the items, without spending tokens on them. A few weeks of this tech, and you will have tons of every effect item, and a fair number of the rarer items as well. With this stock of items, you can make sure everyone starts at 7 satisfaction, even if you don't have the effects you need. The difference between 2 satisfaction and 7 satisfaction is 72 <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico"> for a normal one day guest, and much more for the high payout guests, and the effect items can be pre-installed to activate Hypno-cats, too.</p><br><p>Mad Architect 3/3</p><br><p>This does not make money, and this only really saves you money at 2 stars and above, but the amount of <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico"> you save per segment on your hotel increases radically as your hotel gets bigger, so its a must have as the star level increases.</p><br><p>Cheap Love, Doctor Feelgood, Job's a good un 3/3</p><br><p>Only if you can be online to use them, otherwise skip. They give you another option to reach max satisfaction, although their usefulness is relatively less, as your number of guests increases, because the number of tokens you can give out is limited by your employee number.</p><br><p>DIY-guys, Armor Plating, Mastery Pyromaniacs</p><br><p>DIY-guys is the best of the three, saving you on every repair, about 50 % at level 3. The other two eliminate the need for about half of your normal repairs, lessening the usefulness of the DIY-guys tech. These are more optional techs, but they do save time and <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico"> on hotel maintenance.</p><br><p>Nomadic Pleasure, Crystal Ball</p><br><p>These are only 1 lab point each, and can be helpful in the right circumstances. Ideally, you won't normally move guests, but there are good reasons to do it, and you could make a mistake, so Nomadic Pleasure minimizes the upset, and helps with hypno-cats and the item exploits explained earlier. Crystal Ball just tells you when and if a room service is coming up and when. This can save items on blobs, as getting a request before midnight means they can get to 10 satisfaction without an item. It can also help with having employees giving tokens of appreciation, because you know who not to give them to (they will get the last point of satisfaction from the room service request)</p><br><p>Padded Cell</p><br><p>Depending on your playstyle, this can be more or less useful, and it stops mattering at all once you have all your techs, so i usually avoided it when i was lower level, and just built two institutes and sacrificed all my guests, until i was done sacrificing. But if you get science more slowly, or have 6 employees (and thus cannot kill all of your guests), this can save a lot of cash from the guests that you don't kill with this tech. At level 3, it lowers the upsets from 100% to around 30%.</p><br><p>Toughened Equipment</p><p>I love this tech, but after testing it, what it actually does is rather marginal. it lowers the chance of an item being destroyed from 50% to 30%. You will still lose lots of items, but you will keep a few longer. Save all your Labyrinthian Wardrobes until you have this and racket maxed out, as they work much better if they survive a few checkouts.</p><br><p>In Your Sky</p><br><p>This lowers your taxes by 15 % when maxed, but it is actually much less useful than it seems, because you don't have to pay your taxes at all, if you don't want to <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/eek.png" alt=":tid_eek:" class="tid_ico"> Leona Helmsly, a real world hotel owner, once famously said “only little people pay taxes” That did not help her at her tax evasion trial <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":tid_razz:" class="tid_ico">, but in this game, not paying your tax only means you miss out on some stars and don't level up. Ironically, in order to properly skip out on your taxes, you actually want the tax bill to be as high as possible, so you can still earn some <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico">, just not enough to reach your tax amount, on the day it is due. I recommend even if you will eventually want this tech, that you not get this tech, and instead just hold the lab points without spending them, until you are fully built out, and are ready to really sock away money for your next hotel.</p><br><p>You will want to be at least level 4, for the double payout guests, Hypno-cats, and three day guests, level 5 and 7 are also good levels to stay at. Level 7 gets you all the room types and guests, but level 4 lets you skip out on Bombs (pay more, but can explode), Hystericals, and Ghosts (no effects), and 2 of the four room service types (less room types needed, less likely to be overwhelmed with any one of 4 types of room service requests)</p><br><p>Good Taste</p><br><p>Completely useless from a <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico"> perspective, so its the worst tech for making money, but I know some of you are into purty stuffs in ur hotel, so if you are into that, this is your tech. The drop rate is pretty low, even maxed out, and it only makes random decorations, and never the paint items (you ONLY get paint from the 0 star starter quests, so make SURE you do them when you can) <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"> Get it ASAP if you want it, you only get so many chances for it to activate, and it does not activate on the sacrifice that makes the lab point <img src="../../../../gfx/square/sad.png" alt=":(" class="tid_ico"></p>

Level 4 has 3 high payout guests out of 8 (Hypno-cat, Dumb Fish, Potless Blob), and level 7 has 5 high payout guests out of 12. when you run the fractions, it comes out to :</p><br><p>Level 4 : 9 / 24 or 37.5 % of guests are high payout<br>Level 7 : 10 / 24 or 41.67 % of guests are high payout</p><br><p>So there is more cash per day at level 7, but not decisively more, and developing at level 4 gives you 3 more weeks of low taxes to save for the next bequeath (170,000 <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico"> saved up in the bank so far by level 7 <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/eek.png" alt=":tid_eek:" class="tid_ico">) , and more total guests per day from more Hypno-cats. Also Bomb VIP's can be annoying to properly get the 30 stars, but that's not <img src="http://hotel.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/money.png" alt=":_hotel.en_okbase_25:" class="tid_ico"> related.</p><br><p>I am certain that less room service room types, the less you get overwhelmed. At level 4, i rolled with 5 Laundromatrix and 5 lustro-pumps, and was fine most of the time. Since 4 does not divide into 10 very well, I now have 3 Laundros, 2 Lustros, 3 Chows, and 2 Shambrews. Every few days now I just get killed by either shoes or alcohol requests. I suppose if I ran 12 room service rooms, the issues would be less, but even then I often have most of the rooms sitting idle, because I usually get more of one type of room service request during the rush, and more types of requests means less of each type of room service room can be available.</p>
