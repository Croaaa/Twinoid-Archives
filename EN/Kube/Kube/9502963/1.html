                So I have almost finished counting all the kubes from the last contest (and there were a ton). It has been a headache just counting them all which is awesome. I will have the results and prizes for the competitors in about a week. But in the mean time I thought there should be a more fun and creative contest.<br><br>The goal of the contest is to create a zone(s) designed/dedicated to the game Snake. This can be whatever you want as long as it contains that theme...oh and it should also have the word Popo in it some where <img src="http://data.muxxu.com/img/icons/forum_lol.gif"><br><br>You will have one week untill Fri 2/24 to find 3 areas that would work for your design and send them to me in a message. I will select one of your choices for you to work at. This is to prevent people getting a head start also I will keep these areas secret tell the end of the contest to help with sabotage.<br><br>In your area selections there cannot already be anything player built in the zone(s) this contest is about creating not destroying.<br><br>One the contest starts you will have 3 weeks to finish your areas.<br><br>If you have a rented zone and want to build there as long as it is not really developed yet that is fine. If I think what is there will give you to much of a head start that will not work.<br><br>Judging I will judge based on creativeness, effort, and just how awesome it is. There will be a 1st place and a 2nd place.<br><br>I was thinking about adding a peoples choice but I am worried all the zones will be destroyed if they are posted.<br><br>The prizes first place will recieve zone 6 -8 rented for at least a week and all the kubes in it. These kubes will be added to it starting on friday and I will keep adding rare kubes to it throughout the contest including teleportation, light, shadow, and gem kubes<br><br>Second place will receive an assortment of rare kubes including at least 2 teleportation, light and shadow kubes.<br><br>I am open to any ideas and suggestion but please don't be offended if I don't go with it.<br><br>Anyways hope some people are interested if not oh will.<br><br>Oh and the contest will start the Monday after the deadline for me to recieve your area selections, this is to give me time to visit each area and to pick one of your three choices for you to start at.<br><br><img alt="" src="http://snake.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/fruits_120.gif"><img alt="" src="http://snake.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/fruits_023.gif"><img alt="" src="http://snake.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/fruits_301.gif"><img alt="" src="http://snake.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/fruits_036.gif"><img alt="" src="http://snake.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/fruits_106.gif"><img alt="" src="http://snake.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/fruits_009.gif"><img alt="" src="http://snake.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/fruits_174.gif"><img alt="" src="http://snake.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/fruits_077.gif"><img alt="" src="http://snake.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/fruits_181.gif"><img alt="" src="http://snake.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/fruits_120.gif"><img alt="" src="http://snake.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/fruits_033.gif">
