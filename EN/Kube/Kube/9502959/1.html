                <img alt="" src="http://kube.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/decouverte2.png"> <strong>Guidelines for Kube</strong><br><br>Here are just some guidelines and information about Kube that I find useful and I try and play by.<br><br><cite><img alt="" src="http://kube.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/decouverte1.png"> 1) Most kubes are COMMON just because it is the first time you see a kube does not mean you have to grab it particularly if it is part of a player built structure. With a little bit of exploring you can find 85% of the kubes on islands full of them without having to damage someone else's work. For a list of kubes and how rare they are scroll down.<br><br><img alt="" src="http://kube.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/decouverte1.png"> 2) If you must take a kube from a bridge replace it with another one from your inventory. The destruction of bridges is annoying and it causes people to hide their bridges and sets the whole world back. If they took the time to place that kube there you can take the time to do the same.<br><br><img alt="" src="http://kube.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/decouverte1.png"> 3) If you feel the need to destroy something take your anger out on one of the many islands. When you do it to a player made construction you just create a circle of destruction where nothing cool lasts for very long and we end up with a drab boring world. Put yourself in the other players shoes, how would you like it?<br><br><img alt="" src="http://kube.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/decouverte1.png"> 4) If you are missing some kubes use the trading thread, it works.<br><br><img alt="" src="http://kube.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/decouverte1.png"> 5) Click on forum kubes and leave a message or read what is there, some contain so very cool information, and if it is the only one in an area <strong>leave it there</strong> they are not hard to find.<br><br><img alt="" src="http://kube.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/decouverte1.png"> 6) If you are traveling down a bridge you did not make and you come to an island at the end of the bridge that still has its treasure chests and dark kubes DON'T take them. You did not earn them, you did not spend the hours/days/weeks building that bridge to make it to that island to run out of energy before you could collect the kubes. Only to come back the next day to find someone has taken advantage of your work. Again put yourself in the other players shoes how would you feel?<br><br><img alt="" src="http://kube.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/decouverte1.png"> 7) Building dolmens - It is the common understanding to build them at zones divisible by 5 such as (25, 30) or (-100, 0). This is very important near the starting zones where they can overlap and zones can be lost. I find it less important further out where I would rather see more of the island or starting/exit points of bridges. If you can do both that is ideal.<br><br><img alt="" src="http://kube.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/decouverte1.png"> 8) When you get to a new island for the first time you should circle around it edges this is a good way to see if it is a bonanza island contain vertical rows of rare gem and other rare kubes.<br><br><img alt="" src="http://kube.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/decouverte1.png"> 9) There are invisible islands containing lots of rare kubes look for them by seeing a weird distortion on the horizon while building your bridge. (again if you find one of these while on someone else's bridge leave it alone they have done all the work to get there not you)<br><br><img alt="" src="http://kube.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/decouverte1.png"> 10) Build cool stuff!</cite><br><br><br><img alt="" src="http://kube.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/decouverte2.png"> <strong>Kube List</strong><br><br>Here's a list of the kubes I have found, if you have found one that is not on the list or know a use that is not listed please copy this list and add yours to it then repost that way it will stay updated.<br>Here is a key for what my descriptions mean also for the rarities this is just my opinion and might not be correct:<br><br><cite><em>(found)</em> - means this kube is found on an island<br><em>(created)</em> - mean this kube is made by putting together 27 kubes of the type listed to form a megakube which spawns this type<br><em>(chest)</em> - means this kube is found by being the first to explore an island and opening a chest found on it<br><em>common</em> - This kube is found often and should be easy to locate with very little effort<br><em>uncommon</em> - not as easily found as other kubes however with some effort/research into what island types they spawn on they should be found<br><em>rare</em> - not found easily unless you are the first to explore an island or know about a bonanza island</cite><br><br>If it says past a certain zone number it means the island they are found on is usually past that number but it can be before or after, it is just a guideline.<br><br><br><img alt="" src="http://kube.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/decouverte2.png"> <strong>The Kubes</strong><br><br>Water - (found) - uncommon/common past zone 500<br>Brown Earth - (found) - common<br>Birch Wood - (found) - common<br>Birch Leaves - (found) - common<br>Autumn Earth - (found) - common<br>Autumn Wood - (found) - common<br>Autumn Leaves - (found) - common<br>Dark Earth - (found) - common<br>Dark Wood - (found)- common<br>Dark Leaves - (found) - common<br>Dark Herbs - (found) - common<br>Blue Earth - (found) - common past zone 500<br>Heart of Clouds - (found) - common past zone 500<br>Cloud - (found) - common past zone 500<br>Light Wood - (found) - common<br>Rose Petals - (found) - common<br>Roots - (found) - common<br>Giant Wood - (found) - common<br>Giant Leaves - (found) - common<br>Jungle - (found) - common<br>Snowcovered - (found) - common past zone 300<br>Fir Wood - (found) - common past zone 300<br>Snow Leaves - (found) - common past zone 300<br>Dark Vines - (found) - common<br>Light Vines - (found) - common<br>Rotting Vines - (found) - common<br>Prairie - (found) - common<br>Light Herbs - (found) - less common<br>Herbs - (found) - common<br>Swamp - (found) - common<br>Swamp Wood - (found) - common<br>Swamp Leaves - (found) - common<br>Mud - (found) - common<br>Cold Rock - (found) - common past zone 300<br>Volcanic Rock - (found) - common past zone 300<br>Ashes - (found) - common past zone 300<br>Grais - (found) - common past zone 500<br>Antique Totem Pole - (found) - common past zone 500<br>Pasture - (found) - common<br>White Flower - (found) - common<br>Red Rose - (found) - uncommon<br>Stonedge - (found) - uncommon<br>Savannah - (found) - common<br>Dry Shrub - (found) - common<br>Zebra - (found) - uncommon<br>Elephant - (found) - uncommon<br>Sand - (found) - common past zone 300<br>Cactus - (found) - common past zone 300<br>Acorn - (found) - uncommon<br>Lava - (found) - common past zone 300 - (need suit to pick up or it kills you)<br>Dark - (found/chest) - rare - (most common rare)<br>Koala - (found) - uncommon<br>Invisible - (found) - rare<br>Ruby - (found) - rare<br>Emerald - (found) - rare<br>Sapphire - (found) - rare<br>Quartz  - (found) - rare - (the most rare of the "gem" kubes, while I have found several islands w/ the other types I have only found 1 w/ this)<br>Shadow - (created - emerald, ruby, sapphire) - rare<br>Fog - (created - quartz) - rare<br>Gold - (chest) - rare<br>Light - (created - gold) - rare<br>Teleportation - (created - light, shadow) - rare<br>Forum - (chest) - rare - (clicking on it gives you access to a forum for the zone the kube is in)<br>Spring - (chest) - rare - (jumping on it makes you jump higher)<br>Rubix - (chest) - rare<br>Case - (chest) - rare<br>MT - (created - crate, rubix) - rare<br>Christmas - (found) - uncommon<br>Concrete - (created) - need to purchase the concrete mixer<br><br><br><img alt="" src="http://kube.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/decouverte2.png"> <strong>Formed by megakubes </strong><br><br>Dolmens/Portals - formed by dark kubes - clicking on them allows you to see a 5 x 5 square on your map<br><br>"27 Teleportation Kubes allow you to hire a zone for 100 days, whether it is adjacent to another or not.

It will be harder to pick the kubes up if they are hanging in midair because you must build a stair to get them.</cite>
