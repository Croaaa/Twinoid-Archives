                <p>I think that Teacher Story is a good game but the game really needs balancing. I understand you are making these games to make money but what I am going to say will actually improve user interaction than reduce it.</p><p>Before I get into the core of what I am going to say I would like to point out that you are monetizing the wrong. When designing a game you should develop the core game first and then add on payment stuff afterwards. Right from the get go the core of the game is about making money and the game afterwards with the lack of HP recovery, long waiting periods and locked skills.</p><p>I understand that the in game cash system kinda fixes some of these below but I believe it is not enough to make the game what it can really be.</p><p>1. Waiting period: The first thing I would like to point out is that the time limit for each class is wayyy too high. I read in one of your logs it used to be 7 hours and that totally kills user interaction. I would suggest dropping it down to at least 1 hour. This way people can play more in the day and would do stuff like be forced to buy healing items and unlock slots or go on sick leave. Getting more fun for a shorter time to get them hooked.</p><p>If someone just plays a round and its like "oh you need to wait 5 hours" most people will go away and forget about it.</p><p>2. Healing / Damage: Right now it feels like I take too much damage or I am not healing enough after a class. Having the ability to only heal 4 hp after a class is really bad and forces people to buy a Glass of Farries (as much as I know that is your goal). Its not the fact that in the end we would need to buy that Farrie but the fact there is no way to sustain unless we were really really lucky and got that bonus to resting recovery.</p><p>3. Downtime: Right now there is a clear lack of things to do during downtime. You should put in some kind of event to do while we are waiting for our next class because that will retain people's attention and give them a change from the normal game. I would also like to point out that there is little reason to do anything else but rest because of the reason above (not able to rest enough) that you can never take a turn to do any of the other actions.</p><p>4. Battle system: When i played the battle the first time I really enjoyed it. It is a mashup of a RPG and stategy game. I would like to see a bit more into the mix like a few new skill (for both myself and for the kids) and some other kind of elements that can happen like maybe a thunderstorm where you need to move the kids away from the window or it is raining and the roof is leaking.</p><p>That is all for now, please give the devs your feedback and let them know if you agree with me or not!<img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":tid_smile:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>1,3: They <em>expect</em> you to play other MT games while waiting. <em>All</em> MT games have a play limit per day, which can only be got over by paying in-game money or <em>real money</em>. This is their way of making money btw, since they don't have ads on this site.</p><p>2: Using Farriers is expected and is part of the gameplay, and using as few farriers as possible while gaining exp and budget is the main point of this game. You'll still get enough budget to skip a few classes once in a while.</p>

                <p>My personal feelings</p><p>1. Waiting period: Its fine, if it is too frequent where the number of turns per day is increased there would be an increase in less need to pay to play. Let's not make this a freebie game, although I am one that plays this without investing money, I do invest time to enjoy this very pleasant game.</p><p>2. Healing / Damage: I manage to heal not 4HP but 8HP after class because there are skills that increase this amount. Seems you are too inexperienced to be making comments about this observation. By the way I have never used a Farriers, this means it is not necessary item at all.</p><p>3. Downtime: Are you sincere or has someone paid you to say such nonsense?</p><p>4. Battle system: I never thought the classroom was a battle scenario. Its filled with tender as well as rowdy students, probably too many rowdy students but this is a game that exaggerates real life situations.</p>

                <p>Your name combined with the minimal progress in the game does lead me to be biased about you and your opinion... But let's begin</p><br><p>I agree with <span class="tid_user tid_user_71616 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="71616">45424</span> about your first point</p><p>And I think they decreased the wait time <em>just enough</em> so that the casual player can essentially forget about this game, later returning to a fresh game waiting for them. The timer also trains the less-casual people to keep coming back to the site, rather than just dropping in once a day to spend their daily allotment of plays (like how most other MT games work)</p><p>The timer system breeds user behavior that benefits MT much more than letting someone binge on the game. And MT doesn't want someone to binge on this game, either. There is an "end" to the game, and the gameplay can get incredibly boring if you play too much of it. MT likely enjoys people spending money on the game, but this game is really just an attempt to get you hooked to the Twinoid network in general. There is a strong encouragement to become friends (or just interact) with people, which leads to you seeing some Nexus post from a game you don't play on your home page, and badabing badaboom you're playing a new game with new chances for MT to extract money out of you</p><br><p>The damage and healing is something that you need to strategize about. As mentioned, there are 3 skills that increase that healing amount by 2 points each. If using Farriers bothers you, keep Improved Rest lv1 (if you get it) when you hit your first vacation</p><p>I've described in other threads how I've made a build that allows me to not spend too much <img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/icons/gold.gif" alt=":ts_gold:" class="tid_ico"> on Farriers. I don't think the point of the game is to dump most of your budget into Farriers. I like being able to coast along with free healing between classes, at the expense of wasting turns on summoning my meat shield<br><span class="tid_sideNote">I have been drinking more lately, due to my high level (and tendency to get classes without any healing TP actions)</span></p><p>I am ranked #141 in the overall rankings, and I've spent only a single MTPass (roughly $2, getting me 500 <img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/icons/gold.gif" alt=":ts_gold:" class="tid_ico">) on the game. This is both a brag and a comment on how you don't need to spend gobs of cash on the game. I highly suggest scaring up a MTPass for this game, as the permanent unlocks for paying are useful</p><br><p>As for downtime, this game was teased with a <a target="_blank" href="http://teacher-story.com/mark">grading minigame</a>, which didn't end up appearing as a mechanic in the final game. I assume you could have spent time doing things to give bonuses to yourself or specific students during the downtime</p><br><p>Your idea about moving students to seats that don't have negative modifiers is a neat one... And you'll get new skills on both teacher and student sides. So don't worry about that</p>

This is both a brag and a comment on how you don't need to spend gobs of cash on the game. I highly suggest scaring up a MTPass for this game, as the permanent unlocks for paying are useful</cite><p>In fact, you can an MTPass for free from Carapass, another Motion Twin site. Although, it will take a few months of daily grinding before you get enough points too bid for one since you can (for the most part) play only one game a day there.</p>

                <p>I rediscovered the new twinoid site through this game. Not sure how it got to my attention but I played a little before signing up and realising it was motion-twin, after which i linked my old alphabounce and kadokado accounts from years ago in.</p><p>I then used an MTpass from carapass (they seem to have gotten cheaper since i first gained the points and i bought one that was in a series of 3 adjacent pass auctions) to unlock the extra skill selection.</p><p>Since then i've currently got 2775<img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/icons/gold.gif" alt=":ts_gold:" class="tid_ico"> have been mostly picking skills that i have never picked before to unlock them on my teacher page (including one run having lvl 3 critical hit and educational flick at the same time, not good <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">) and haven't really seen a problem with SC/farriers <img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/items/Badgeso.png" alt=":teacher_badgeso_1:" class="tid_img tid_parsed" style=""></p><p>Also worth noting that i only pay to skip clas timers if the cost is at or below 20... depending on the class i'm with, that can often mean 4 classes in a row</p>
