                <p>That depends what you prefer, less rewards to play it safe or not</p><p>I love extra pupils, but I also lucked out on skills so that makes things much easier, but generally speaking pupils are worth it for very simple reasons.</p><p>1 - Mission choosing always tend to go toward the ones where its 'x pupil need to have x score' but definitely not the entire class as late arriving pupils can mess planning up, this being said you can always raise the scores of the extra pupils to both fulfill mission objective and the pupil's so why not get the extra benefit?</p><p>2 - Damage can't be avoided as far as I've seen, pet skills that protect you from pupils takes a bit to be reusable so one or 2 more students doesn't make much of a difference, normally until the very last round you will still have active pupil(s) that will do you dmg, except for the very early levels I have long ceased to be able to defeat the entire class in favor of finishing the mission early and aiming for certain students rather than the whole</p><p>In your scenario where you only have to concentrate on one guy, surely in 12-13 turns you can defeat the extra pupils aswell and have time left, so why not do it? Not to mention all those tables at the front giving +2 seems wasted if you don't use it at all :p</p><p>I'm definitely pro extra pupils<img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/loc/en/notes/Plus1.png" alt=":teacher_bobj_1:" class="tid_img tid_parsed" style=""></p>

                <p>Honestly, I've never seen two students attack in a single turn, so unless the friend get's tagged with an ongoing effect not having them isn't going to stop a student from attacking any given round. (I'm also not entirely sure ongoing damage is ticked if you're hit with another attack, looks like in my last two classes a character started laughing uncontrollably, but I don't recall taking the -1 SC when another student attacked. Most likely I just wasn't paying attention, going to try to next few classes)l</p><p>True that some missions might make a side objective difficult or impossible to beat (like a mission of 16/20 x 1 with a side mission of 20/20), but most of the time they'll fall in line, worst case (for me, at least) is it takes one extra class to complete the mission than you might have needed otherwise, for example, if you have 4 classes to meet the objective and you can get the side done in 4 classes, but could have gotten the mission done in 3 classes if you weren't worried about the side mission.</p><p>All in all, unless the mission is to get every student to a minimum score, or every student but one to a passing grade, any extra student is only going to offer you more versatility.</p>

                <p>It's possible to get a score of 20/20 on a student with a main objective of 16/20 x 1, but it requres a specific skill set to do it.</p><p>First you need to get the pupil up to a score of 15.5/20 in a prior class.<br>In the final class, you need to defeat the pupil in the front row for +2.<br>You'll also need the pet ability Antiwag cast on the pupil for +1.<br>Finally, you have two available options:<br>Option A: the pupil needs to raise their hand and "understand" for +1 as well as defeat the pupil with the level-up skill "Helping Hand" for +0.5 or "Flick" for +1.5 to get a total +4.5 or +5.5 respectively for the class( and in the case of "Flick" you could have the pupil raised to only 14.5/20 from a prior class)<br>Option B: you must have "flick" unlocked and defeat the pupil with it for the +1.5 point bonus and the grand total of +4.5 for the class.</p><p>So, yeah, it's unlikely, but not impossible. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

Feel free to "attack" me with additional students at any time!</p><p>I usually select a mission which is to get a small amount of students to a fairly high score, and the player sent students usually require a fairly high score to win their secondary quest reward, so there's a synergy there. And for whatever random reason, those missions have always been the highest EXP payoff, so they are more attractive even without additional students.</p><p>If you keep your queue filled up then the player sent students arrive in the second turn of the first and second classes. If your queue isn't full then I guess you can be surprised by a student arriving on the last class, but I've never had that happen to me. There's an easy solution there, just make some friends and keep your queue full. Three students sent per day should get you enough return students to keep the queue at maximum.</p>
