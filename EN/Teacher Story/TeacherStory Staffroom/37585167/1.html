I assume Camarada_Ndomo was given the same two choices from any other summer vacation: stay at the maximum level or restart from Level 1. Since it's much easier to collect objects and earn T-S ranking points at the lower levels, restarting is the only sensible choice.</p><p>What a complete waste of time and money.</p>

                <p>It is completely unbiased. I'd like to remind you that Motion Twin is a French company with the vast majority of players being from France. Of course there's no wonder that the top 10 spots are mostly occupied by French players. Just compare how much activity this forum gets with the French version.</p><p>Just for your interest, it is easy for any player (who started from the beginning) to get in top 20 without actually paying for anything. Jumping from there to top 10 by paying is not that big of a deal.</p>

There are 26 active skills, and paying players can choose between 3 options on each level up.

You're somehow implying that my arguments are invalid just because I got a couple thousand more gold than a free player. That is not the case as I've explained before.

If I focused on ranking points I could probably do much better.</p><p>Also the reason why my score jumped in the past is because I used to skip the timer whenever I'd finish a class with 6 or more turns remaining, which happened rather often. Now before you jump in and say "see so paying did indeed put you in a major advantage!", it's not true. By skipping the timer and buying Farriers I'd have a net gain of 0 <img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/icons/gold.gif" alt=":ts_gold:" class="tid_ico">. I didn't buy anything else.</p><p>Constantly skipping the timer like that you can be a free player and also be in a top position. <em>Easily</em>. It does require effort but there isn't much skill involved, you just have to find an equilibrium, you don't wanna end up with no gold. On the other hand it takes skills to maximize <img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/icons/small_xp.gif" alt=":ts_xp:" class="tid_ico"> efficiency and if the ranking board were sorted based on Grades and Levels it would be an entirely different story.</p>

And that's with skipping the timer once or none at all.</cite><p>Do you finish classes with 6 turns leftover on average? I don't think anyone except someone with the right skill set can pull that off. A more likely scenario is there are some classes you average say 1-3 turns left and some you finish with around 4-7 turns left. Going off from 168 points, you get about 90 points for free, so you're left with 78 unaccounted for. You skip timers for two classes, you have 10 total leftover turns a day. You skip the timer for one class, that's 18 total leftover turns a day. If you play an average of 5 classes a day, that means you need to average 16 leftover turns a day. I had assumed that the classes you did not skip had 0 leftover to make the cost of skipping timers the cheapest to show even under extreme circumstances that make it easier for one to pull it off, it is still difficult. If I make that assumption now, that means you have two classes with an average of 8 leftover turns per class. Possible once in a while, but not everyday (at least, not without the right skills). Since having 3-4 classes a day with 0 leftover turns is just as unlikely to happen, I'm going to assume the two classes you paid for have a total of 10 leftover turns. That leaves you about 50 <img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/icons/gold.gif" alt=":ts_gold:" class="tid_ico"> a day, which is not that much considering how many classes you have to play a day, especially at higher levels.</p><span class="tid_preCite"><span class="tid_user tid_user_3801 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="3801">norby89</span></span><cite>You don't have to pay when skipping costs too much, that's ineffective.

In all my years playing MT games, there only two cases I know of where MT has subsidized individual players:<br>1. There was a group of players that were affected by a serious bug in Alphabounce and had to restart their accounts to get the bug fixed.<br>2. There is a YouTuber bringing in a lot of new Mush players because of his Let's Play videos.<br>Also, from my experience talking with mods and a few admins, I have no reason to believe anyone playing Teacher Story is being subsidized by an admin unless they are an admin themselves and they usually stay at the bottom of the rankings.<br>Just because you can't believe someone is spending a lot of their own money to be at the very top of the rankings doesn't mean that person must be subsidized.</p>
