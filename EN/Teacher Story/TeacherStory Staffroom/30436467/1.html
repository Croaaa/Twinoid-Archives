                <p>Should have been here a couple months ago. Timer used to be 7 hours between classes AND there was NO discount on buying off the timer (cost 50<img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/icons/gold.gif" alt=":ts_gold:" class="tid_ico"> no matter how quickly you beat your last class or how long you waited to buy it off).</p><p>IMO, be glad they give you the offer to buy off the timer. Standard MT model has been to only give 3 free games per day. That's it. No more. Actually, Natural Chemist and Caverns of Hammerheim only give 1 free game per day, so even 3 games can be considered a blessing.</p><p>The fact you can earn enough free budget in this game to never actually have to purchase any ever is already amazing, even if you do have to wait a few hours between classes. I can tell you at least that the waiting between plays in this game is still miles better than in MUSH. AP gain in that game is so horrendously slow I'm lucky if I can do anything more than once every day and a half. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So, yeah, for an independent group of friends pumping out free casual games, what do you expect for nothing? If you want a game that's going to occupy your time for hours on end, you're coming to the wrong website. MT games have always been, and likely will always continue to be, a colossal waste of time. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> It's all "hurry up and wait", log in once every so often for a few clicks and then go do something else (like play one or more of their other games <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lookup.png" alt=":innocent:" class="tid_ico">).</p><p>And if you want to see one of their games that'll really test your patience, check out Kingdoms. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/square/twisted.png" alt=":sadist:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Coro, if you'll recall a few months ago, I did mention I'd rather have the tokens to play my three daily classes a day at my leisure, but I also said that when the cost to skip the timer was a static 50<img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/icons/gold.gif" alt=":ts_gold:" class="tid_ico">. Under that model, given tokens to play the three games and then letting people pay 50<img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/icons/gold.gif" alt=":ts_gold:" class="tid_ico"> for each additional game the same day would have been a better model. Now that the cost to skip the timer can be reduced, it is possible to gain more games for virtually no cost, and using in-game money, with a little bit of skill, luck and patience, though I will concede that this model does reward skilled players more.</p><p>Way I see it, if you're wanting tokens, it's because you aren't willing to buy off the timer. If you aren't willing to buy off the timer you probably aren't willing to purchase budget. If you aren't willing to purchase budget then you aren't making MT money. From a business standpoint, tokens aren't profitable.</p><p>Way I see it, if you're skilled enough to get the cost of the timer down, then you'll be more willing to buy it off. If you're more willing to buy off the timer then you're more willing to purchase budget to do so, because you have some control on just how quickly your budget is spent. And since you're more willing to purchase budget, you're helping to make MT money. From a business standpoint, the timer is profitable.</p><p>Would it be possible to have both tokens AND purchasable classes? To use tokens when the budget cost is high (and you have tokens available) and use budget when the budget cost is low? Might work if the only thing reducing the cost is how quickly you beat a class, but how often do even skilled players get the class beaten with 8 or more turns remaining (thus getting maximum reduction at class end)? I think even the most skilled players are still going to end up needing to wait a few hours for the cost to come down to the cheapest 10<img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/icons/gold.gif" alt=":ts_gold:" class="tid_ico"> to skip. But if we have tokens to skip the class, what purpose would the timer serve other than to reduce the cost to skip it? Probably better to just remove the timer entirely, meaning it'll be less likely even skilled players would purchase the next class, meaning less likely budget will be purchased to make MT money. Kind of makes having both a lousier business model than just sticking with the timer and timer buy off.</p><p>Or maybe I just need to spend a little more time working out a model to make it work. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

It's a timer system with a bit of the benefits of a token system, while also giving skilled players a break. Any specific numbers I mention are up for debate, I'm just giving a general frame of reference</p><br><p>My idea would add two things: batteries and stress</p><p>Batteries are for your moped (if there is some solid evidence that James has a gas-powered vehicle... REMOVE THE EVIDENCE), and a single battery charge will get you to and from the school. You get a full battery charge after 8 hours of waiting. The explanation for this is that James needs a good night of sleep, and he left a battery to charge overnight. You can reduce this timer to 5 hours by way of doing some exercise. This is done by partially charging the battery via a bike generator (James is awesome enough to have that be an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/05/bike-powered-electricity-generators.html">efficient source of energy</a>). The exercise allows him to have a more efficient amount of sleep</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">And if you want to skip either timer, then you can pay budget (8 hrs. - 100 <img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/icons/gold.gif" alt=":ts_gold:" class="tid_ico"> / 5 hrs. - 70 <img src="http://teacher-story.com/img/icons/gold.gif" alt=":ts_gold:" class="tid_ico">). I couldn't think of a reasonable explanation for that cost .-.</span></p><p>Stress is a new thing to manage, which will have an effect on the damage you receive during class. The lowest level of Stress affords James a bonus to resisting attacks. The level above that is "normal", and gameplay is the same as it is now. Next, the chance of student criticals is doubled. Finally, all student attacks are crits, and you are capped at 90% of your total SC. Being at the highest Stress level does not prevent you from teaching (but you'll be quickly forced to deal with it). Stress goes up when you do not have a perfect class, or take over half of your SC in damage in a single class. Stress goes down with a good night's sleep. Exercising before sleeping negates the Stress relief. In addition to recovering SC, Farriers now lower your Stress</p><br><br><p><em>Oh hi wall of text, how ya doin'</em></p>

                <p>I frequently think they're going about it the wrong way. It's customization which players pay for. I'm on two different sites which also do daily play, and their temptations are in seasonal items which have to be bought Right Now.</p><p>Since one site has low traffic and yet has a chunk of players who put down <strong>hundreds</strong> of dollars a month just to keep up with the Joneses, it's certainly feasible. Just like gas stations and movie theaters, the profit's in the ancillary items. If they really want to milk our pockets, they'd elevate room customization from an afterthought of a status reward to an overabundance of choices, some of which have price tags.</p><p>Unless it's too much against the trope of teachers being overworked and underpaid. <em>Will the earnest samurai despise the merchant class... </em></p>

Since there is a form of leaderboard, some people are willing to pay incredible ammounts to get as close to the top of that list as they possibly can. Or to be the first to complete a set of trinkets to get the title associated with it. Or any number of things.</p><p>For me, there's also a variable work schedule, so sometimes it happens if I don't buy off the timer I'll only be able to get 2 classes that day, so sometimes I'm willing to pay a little more for that third class (and those are the days I'm most wishful for a token-based system <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">).</p>

                <p>I like the core of coro's suggestion, especially the incentive to work for perfect classes. The stress mechanic could be worked into all sorts of skills, assistants, etc., although it seems like a lot of balancing would be required to make it so that it's not too easy to stay at the lowest level.</p>
