                <p><strong><em>My first cup!</em></strong></p><p><strong>Objective</strong><br>Gain the most credits within a specific period of time. Your army power and number of recruits are fixed for fairness.</p><p><strong>Preparation</strong><br>1. Get a new army. It doesn't matter how you acquire the army, as long as it consists of <strong>one level 1 trooper only</strong>, i.e. has a power of 5.<br>2. Get at most 9 recruits. It is the cap for the number of recruits.<br>3. Train those new recruits. The strength of the recruits is unlimited, and you can get as many recruits <strong>for your recruits</strong> as you like.<br>4. Sign up here!</p><p><strong>Sign up</strong><br>Post your army /hq link and any of its recruits' /ranks page link in this thread.</p><p>e.g. Your army is "TheCCRulz!" and one of its recruits is named "Strongest", then post the following:<br><a href="http://theccrulz.minitroopers.com/hq" target="_blank">http://theccrulz.minitroopers.com/hq</a><br><a href="http://strongest.minitroopers.com/ranks" target="_blank">http://strongest.minitroopers.com/ranks</a></p><p><strong>Rules</strong><br>1. There will be a starting date and an ending date specified once the registration closes. <strong>The competition ends at 4:00pm server time on the ending date, and I'll start checking your credit count just after that time in an unknown order.</strong> I believe all of you can be online before 4pm server time.<br>2. You must not upgrade your single trooper, nor recruit another one. <strong>Your army's power must still be 5 at the end of the competition.</strong><br>3. You must not have more than 9 recruits for your army. I can check that on the /ranks page.<br>4. There's no actual gameplay. <strong>Just do your best to get most money for your army!</strong><br>5. There'll be scoring checkpoints at regular intervals throughout the competition days. I'll announce the actual dates when this competition starts. <strong>Checkpoint credit counts are also checked at 4pm server time on that day.</strong></p><p><strong>Scoring</strong><br>The scoring is based on your ranking in various checkpoints. It is progressively weighted.</p><p>1st checkpoint:<br><em>First: 9 points<br>Second: 7 points<br>Third: 6 points<br>4th: 5 points<br>5th: 4 points<br>6th: 3 points<br>7th: 2 points<br>8th: 1 point</em></p><p>2nd checkpoint:<br><em>First: 18 points<br>Second: 14 points<br>Third: 12 points<br>4th: 10 points<br>5th: 8 points<br>6th: 6 points<br>7th: 4 points<br>8th: 2 points</em></p><p>3rd checkpoint:<br><em>First: 27 points<br>Second: 21 points<br>Third: 18 points<br>4th: 15 points<br>5th: 12 points<br>6th: 9 points<br>7th: 6 points<br>8th: 3 points</em></p><p>4th checkpoint:<br><em>First: 36 points<br>Second: 28 points<br>Third: 24 points<br>4th: 20 points<br>5th: 16 points<br>6th: 12 points<br>7th: 8 points<br>8th: 4 points</em></p><p>End:<br><em>First: 60 points<br>Second: 50 points<br>Third: 45 points<br>4th: 40 points<br>5th: 35 points<br>6th: 30 points<br>7th: 25 points<br>8th: 20 points<br><strong>9th: 15 points<br>10th: 10 points<br>11th: 5 points</strong></em></p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">Note: this scoring scheme is not finalized.

The retreat and propaganda commands can only harm your recruit count. Try to scale the levels such that the Comms. Officer always appears in the last wave.<br>2. You might want to avoid Survivor and Saviour as well, but they are sometimes useful if you can keep the survived/saved trooper's life.<br>3. Attacking your rivals' army with a much stronger one to mess up their infiltrate missions is considered unsporting.<br>4. <strong>Protect your army with a password!</strong><br>5. You can reuse your army for the next ESC <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>6. GL and HF!</p>
