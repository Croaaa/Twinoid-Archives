                In commemoration of getting my 9th Unit tomorrow, I'd thought I share with anyone interested an inside look at how I see my army.  I'd like to do a smaller scale "Rate my Army" sometime in the future with this kind of in-depth analysis with other armies, but I'd like some feedback.  Is the way that I rate accurate?  Do I over/under rate my units?  Do I like to ramble a lot? I thought I'd start with my own army and I'd like to try this with someone else's army in the future.<br><br>-Personal Unit Ratings-<br>Firepower: The ability to do damage.  Being able to deal massive amounts or quickly dispatch opponents.<br>Survival: The ability to take damage and live.  Being able to take a hit in situations and continue to fight.<br>Mobility: The ability to move.  Being able to get into position and being timely about it to initiate in combat.<br>Usefulness: The abilities that help the team.  Being able to contribute to the improvement of the team’s overall performance that may not necessarily involve combat.<br>Overall: The complete thought of the unit.  Special notes about each unit also included here.<br><br>ID: Fighter<br>Class: Comms. Officer<br>Description: Anti-Vehicle/Anti-Personal Specialist<br>Favorite Weapon: Infernal Tube<br>Other Weapons: Revolver, Pump Action Shotgun, Assault Rifle<br>Equipment: Explosive Shells, Toxic Shells<br>Skills: On Point, Hurry, Survivor<br>Bio: Fighter started as an experiment.  He has amassed a variety of weapons during the early age of the unit’s creation as a response to his encounters against saboteurs.<br><br>-Rating-<br>Firepower: Has the most weapons in the unit as well as the only user of a rocket weapon.  With the inclusion of his shells he packs quite a punch. (5/5)<br>Survival: Other than the fact that he has Survival he does not have any sort of defence or extra fortification. (2.5/5)<br>Mobility: Hurry and On Point are easily cancelled out by holding and operating a heavy weapon. (2/5)<br>Usefulness: A given is that he is a Comms. Officer, however nothing too helpful other than killing things. (2/5)<br>Overall: I’d say he isn’t special, but is very integral in the coordination of the team offensive. (3.5/5)<br><br>ID: Ranger<br>Class Comms. Officer<br>Description: Jack-of-all-Trades<br>Favorite Weapon: M16<br>Other Weapons: Shotgun<br>Equipment: Motorcycle, Explosive Shells, Hydroshock Shells, Talky-Walky<br>Skills: Huge Calves, Take Cover, Tuck-N-Roll<br>Bio: As the second trooper in the unit, Ranger was designed to compliment Fighter in combat.  Motorcycle was selected as a viable option to have a gap closer for Ranger to assault against long range assault while Fighter was to follow up as back-up.<br><br>Firepower: While only holding 2 weapons, he uses them with high proficiency with aid of his high damaging shells, he definitely hurts when it counts. (4/5)<br>Survival: Has a good set of agility skills to dodge bullets, stays in the fray longer than many of my other troops. (4/5)<br>Mobility: Second fastest and capable of dodging, I’d say he can get around (3.5/5)<br>Usefulness: His Comms. Assistance and his Talky which has done some nifty combos, nothing much else. (3/5)<br>Overall: As my average man, he actually performs quite well as a go to guy. (3.5/5)<br><br>ID: Rogue<br>Class: Spy<br>Description: Assault Trooper<br>Favorite Weapon: Pump Action Shotgun<br>Other Weapons: MOS-Teck, Sniper<br>Equipment: Full Metal Balaclava, Bullet-Proof Vest, Compesator<br>Skills: Frenetic, Charge, Trigger Happy<br>Bio: Rogue began as a long range specialist and was very successful in that aspect.  But at the selection of his class I had recalled the perversion of my army by a spy and thought a spy would work great on my team.  Sadly at the time he had not achieved anything useful at all for spy usage.  It was afterwards when claiming his trademark Pump Action Shotgun did he begin to achieve top spy potential.<br><br>Firepower: My top shocktrooper when it comes to killing everything not inside a thick hull.  With his trusty Shotgun countless foes fall continually. (5/5)<br>Survival: Wears pretty much a full suit of Kevlar to survive an onslaught.  However being immediately in firing range of the enemy is a 50:50 fight. (3/5)<br>Mobility: Originally designed as a sniper, mobility was not selected at all for his work as a sniper or as a spy. (1/5)<br>Usefulness: All my spies work as aggressive distractions. (3/5)<br>Overall: So many of my matches have been single-handedly won by Rogue alone.  And if not won a good amount have been killed, unless of course he is taken out very early. (4/5)<br><br>ID: Wizard<br>Class: Spy<br>Description: Tank Pilot/Bait<br>Favorite Weapon: Sniper<br>Other Weapons: N/A<br>Equipment: Light-Tank, Twinoid, Bullet-Proof Vest<br>Skills: Smart, On Point, Frenetic, Take Cover, Tuck-N-Roll<br>Bio: Seemingly started as a throw-away unit to experiment with certain combinations of skills, Wizard’s beginnings were mediocre.  What intrigued me was that he was the first trooper to attain Smart and Twinoid the uses making Wizard a viable member of the team despite his major weakness, his lack of weaponry.  Before Monk, Wizard was the hand-to-hand combat specialist of the corps having been frequently sabotaged.<br><br>Firepower: Without counting the rare tank occasion, Wizard is the weakest member of the unit. (1.1/5)<br>Survival: Has some gear and skills that allow him to leave a fight without much pain. However the self-poisoning if not treated simply let’s him die. (2.5/5)<br>Mobility: With the use of Twinoid and other bonuses, Wizard can get around if he wants to. (3/5)<br>Usefulness: Save the tank and the occasional Twinoid punch barrage, Wizard does little to provide anything to the crew. (1.1/5)<br>Overall: Wizard has the most potential in the unit to be something amazing, however that potential is only obvious when he’s riding in his tank. (1/5, 5/5 if he is in the tank)<br><br>ID: Cleric<br>Class: Doctor<br>Description: Combat Medic<br>Favorite Weapon: Pump Action Shotgun<br>Other Weapons: Shotgun<br>Equipment: Grenade, Fragmentation Grenade<br>Skills: Smart, Savior, Tuck-N-Roll, Covering Fire, Adrenaline<br>Bio: At this point the commanding officer has finally begun getting a grasp of combat and troop creation and Cleric is proof of that improvement.  Discovering counters against certain tactics and getting the first sets of class specializations were all new and exciting, but I still wasn’t lucky until Cleric showed me how far my luck could go. I’d say cleric has some of the best synergy in terms of skills in my team.<br><br>Firepower: Average in firepower, however he can’t aim grenades at all. (2.5/5)<br>Survival: Despite only having 1 survival tactic he lives through a lot.  His survival is complemented by an initiative bonus for better positioning. (3/5)<br>Mobility: No movement bonuses, save for the dodge and boost combo.  However when using doctor abilities he gets free movement when healing and reviving which very useful. (3/5)<br>Usefulness: I can’t get enough to how much this guy brings to the team.  Doctors are so overpowered and since he can revive it’s just incredible, probably the backbone the army. (5/5)<br>Overall: By no means bad in any aspect, outside of my spies Cleric highly defines what my team is. (5/5)<br><br>ID: Monk<br>Class: Comms. Officer<br>Description: Close Range Interference Specialist<br>Favorite Weapon: Semi-Automatic Shotgun<br>Other Weapons: Pistol<br>Equipment: Gas Grenade<br>Skills: On Point, Sprinter, Huge Calves, Hurry, Tuck-N-Roll, Faceboot<br>Bio: Something that lacked in the unit was a specific counter to certain situations, overall the unit held in balance against most armies.  Monk was another experiment in speed and interference, and somehow he was given all the tools that perfectly synergize with that concept.  I still fall victim to sabotage and second wave snipers and Monk is my very counter to that.<br><br>Firepower: Monk is very special in terms of firepower.  Before he aquired his Semi-Auto Shotgun it was important that Monk fall victim to sabotage. I started him with a faceboot and sprinter.  As you can guess the results we’re almost Chuck Norris-esqe in terms of speed and power with punches and kicks.  And now with his new toy he can knockdown everything faster and safer than any of my spies. (4/5)<br>Survival: High speed and dodge means less chances of taking hits. (4/5)<br>Mobility: 135% Movement Speed, a dodge, and some extra health. (5/5)<br>Usefulness: He’s purposely designed to chase weapon users who need a secure space to fire so that they don’t fire and knockdown everything else. (4/5) <br>Overall: Monk will mess your army up if you aren’t wary of him.  He’s made the most comebacks from losing in my unit out of anyone. However is no means perfect and has run recklessly into danger countless times.  (4/5)<br><br><br><br>ID: Paladin<br>Class: Spy<br>Description: Assault Trooper<br>Favorite Weapon: Scattergun<br>Other Weapons: AK-47, Sniper<br>Equipment: Hydroshock Shells, Bullet-Proof Vest, Fragmentation Grenade, Heat Sensor*<br>Skills: Frenetic, Camouflage<br>Bio: Paladin was to be the second Ranger of the unit, and in a sense he is.  He isn’t as defined as Fighter or Rogue by he gets the job done.  I was just excited to finally have my 7th unit to finally be on even odds against many of the harder opponents.  I originally hoped that Paladin was going to be my saboteur and Wizard and Rogue would take care of the spy stuff.  Didn’t pan out that way, but I’m not at all disappointed how he’s turned out so far.<br><br>Firepower: In terms of firepower between my spies, Paladin is actually the strongest.  However he isn’t the fastest since Wizard has On Point and Rogue has an enhancer to his reloading which is already fast. Still he carries those fatal shells and good weapons. (4.5/5)<br>Survival: Interestingly he’s a spy with Camouflage and many times he gets ignored while he gets to pop shots in the backs of the enemy.  But when he does get caught, he only has a layer of Kevlar on his chest and a 20% dodge rate. (3/5)<br>Mobility: None. (1/5)<br>Usefulness: Another aggressive distraction (3/5)<br>Overall: Quite average like Ranger, gets the job done when it counts. Doesn’t stand out like Rogue, but has very similar capabilities (3.5/5)<br><br><br>ID: Bard<br>Class: Munitions<br>Description: Long Range Support Specialist<br>Favorite Weapon: CK-Magellan<br>Other Weapons: Dual Pistols, Pistol<br>Equipment: N/A<br>Skills: Smart, Heartbreaker, Covering Fire, Bounce Back, Battle-Ready, Bait<br>Bio: Greatly lacking in my troop was the ability to make fatal shots quickly.  Although the company’s spies very capable of getting first blood, maintaining survival for them was nigh impossible.  Bard was recruited solely on the fact that he was a deadshot against hearts.<br><br>Firepower: You can’t argue with “Shot to the Heart” hovering over the heads of dead bodies.  A fully loaded CK-Magellan or Dual Pistols concentrating for that perfect shot or that counter attack via covering fire.  Very strong. (5/5)<br>Survival: Bait is a double-edged sword in terms of usefulness and survival.  The obvious is that he is aimed by everything.  The good news is that if it is explosive there’s a high chance that he will survive it (and get a bonus for it).  That extra health is good too, funny how bait worked out very useful for him. (3.5/5)<br>Mobility: None, designed as a long range fighter. (1/5)<br>Usefulness: If Cleric is the backbone of my army, then Bard has to be the heart(breaker).  As the main distraction Bard allows safe killings for my spies to sweep the enemies away with shotguns, while he himself picks off the rest.  It also helps that he restocks those easily reloadable shotgun shells the enemies sure love to take in. (5/5)<br>Overall:  Bard is probably my 2nd favorite trooper in my unit after Monk.  After taking a rocket or a shotgun to the face he gets up and shoots right back.  A good representation of strength I’d say. (4.5/5)<br><br>-Special Notes-<br>24 Points of Comms. Accessing Solo Mission, Commando, Retreat, Reinforcements, and Propaganda.<br>Even though only 8 troopers, if you include Fighter’s Survival, Cleric’s Savior, and at least 1 propaganda, that’s a minimum of 11 troopers.<br>6 of my 8 units have some kind of shotgun.<br><br>My current formation is Rogue, Paladin, Fighter, Bard, Cleric, Wizard, Ranger, Monk.<br>1. Rogue (Spy deployment, highest priority)<br>2. Paladin (Spy deployment, secondary deployment)<br>3. Fighter (Access to Survival which can not be used if there is no following unit deployment)<br>4. Bard (To assist spies) <br>5. Cleric (To revive important units, Bard for more support and my preferred choice, or Fighter.  If Fighter is selected for revival and my second wave is killed he will not use Surival.  However if fighter dies and the entire enemy wave is killed with units on my side Fighter will use survival.)<br>6. Wizard (Placeholder, to seperate Comms. Officers from First wave deaths.  Can still summon tank from this position.)<br>7. Ranger (In certain special cases, Ranger can use Talky-Walky to call in the last units, whether it’s Monk or the Savior’d unit if they aren’t already in.)<br>8. Monk (Highest comeback potential unit)<br><br>-Overall Rating-<br>Firepower: While my entire army is capable of good hits, it still falls short from other armies that I’ve seen.  Much of my army fights by isolating units and picking them off 1 by 1. (3.5/5)<br>Survival: If there’s something my army can certainly do, it is survive.  Replays of my troopers rolling out of explosions and heavy fire are everywhere.  Be careful letting Cleric living too long, he can certainly make my army last. (4.5/5)<br>Mobility: Other than Monk and my spies already being in a position of firing, not too much can be said about this other than it’s pretty good. (3.5/5)<br>Usefulness: I seem to get a lot of credit for making a very coordinated team.  Not necessarily the strongest, but definitely I think can go far in combat. (4/5)<br>Overall: I found my personal rating of my army a tad hard,  I think I give my units too much credit despite their shortcomings.  I don’t think these ratings are 100% accurate but this is how I feel now and I’m satisfied with how it’s turned out. (5/5 just to be corny)<br><br>tl;dr - SilentPinoy has an awesome army. <img alt="" src="http://fever.en.muxxu.com/img/icons/rec/item_15.gif">

                How much time did you spend making this ?? *_*<br><br><em>- Your rating is pretty accurate</em><br><br><br>Quick self rating of mt army:<br><br>-<strong>Masterchief</strong>: He is just awesome when he uses his heavy machine gun (when it's not sabotaged). The adrenaline and the dodge skills combo makes him my favorite trooper. He is my main Spy killer. I only wish he had "Tuck n' roll" to have all the most important dodge skills, "suspicious" so his weapons wouldn't get sabotaged and and death grip or friendly fire so he would stop hitting his own teammates when there are spies around. I also wish he had frenetic ^^.<br><em>Rating: 4.5/5</em><br><br>-<strong>Roy</strong>: I used to love him because of his MOS-TECK. But now I realise how useless he is. That would be a whole different story if he had a CK-Magellan though <img src="http://muxxu.com/img/icons/forum_lookup.gif"><br><em>Rating: 1.5/5</em><br><br>-<strong>Stang</strong>: I like him, It's a good thing he has a rocket launcher and not any other bazooka because it's not considered as a heavy weapon. It's useful because with the rush skill, he fires fast without aiming.<br><em>Rating: 3/5</em><br><br>-<strong>Doomys</strong>: I just wished he had more health because to me, a medic needs more than 10 hp to be really useful. He does a great job with his bazookas (+nimble fingers) but I wish he had better aim.<br><em>Rating: 3/5</em><br><br><br><em>I'll do the rest of my army later.</em>

                I didn't read your entire post, but my opinion of your army is that it's pretty good. I'm having trouble defeating them lately, but that's mainly due to the spies. In fact, I often have to reconfigure the formation of my army before I challenge the likes of you and caine because of those devilish spies. They've become a pain in the butt. However, while your other troopers are pretty good too, I do feel that if not for those spies, I'd have the upper hand <img src="http://muxxu.com/img/icons/forum_razz.gif">

                I'd agree.  SilentPinoy's spies are formidable.  I wish my spies were as good.  On the plus side, I'll soon have enough T to level up one of my troopers without going below the T required to add a ninth trooper.

                Spyless and hating it <img src="http://muxxu.com/img/icons/forum_sad.gif"><br>Anyway...<br><br><em>Ol' Painless</em><br>Being my first trooper, I had no idea what I was doing, so in my foolishness I chose Scout over Comms Officer (because he had a sniper rifle so it seemed more appropriate). However, this paid off and I now have binoculars. This trooper has no passive abilities as of yet, just equipment and weapons. He's better suited as a defender, however he occaisionally proves his worth by getting a few mid-close range kills. Overall a standard trooper, nothing special.<br><br><em>Boomstick</em><br>One trick pony, using cold blooded, on point and M1, he fires off a rocket and proceeds to teamkill everyone else with a shotgun that has explosive rounds. Has fall guy and no vehicle, fairly derp moment on my part. <span class="tid_spoil">Oh, and he's a pilot</span><br><br><em>Newbie</em><br>Named for his ginger hair (gingers suck at most things). I don't really know what he does exactly aside from being a sab, he sort of sits at the back with a gatling doing fuck all. He has first aid so if he doesn't get sniped or blown up he can be there quite a while. Has a pistol he somehow prefers to use that gets him killed 9/10 times.<br><br><em>Boggy B</em><br>Fairly tank-like for a soldier. Sucked major arse until recently when he got a famas (his only other weapon other than default assault). Has on point, vendetta (god knows why) and charge. His primary purpose is to take the hits/kill spies.<br><br><em>Shaarpshoota</em><br>How I pronounce sharpshooter. A pilot, much to my ever lasting shame, he should REALLY be a comms and I'll tell you why. He sits at the back the whole time and is almost always my last trooper to die. He has a sniper and a lizaro, equipped with toxic shells and a talky-walky. He also has crybaby. So basically he targets the stronger troopers and poisons/kills them whilst calling in back-up pretty much non-stop. He's probably causes more damage than people notice. I guess it could be good that he's a pilot <br><span class="tid_spoil">No one ever has pilots as priority targets <img src="http://muxxu.com/img/icons/forum_lookup.gif"></span><br><br><em>Penfold</em><br>Pretty decent brawler and my only smart trooper, has most things needed for a close range confrontation (charge, faceboot, shotgun etc.) and does large amounts of damage when he goes on a solo mission. Only snag is he doesn't last that long and <strong>HE'S A MUNITIONS TROOPER.<br></strong><br><br><em>Cnut</em><br>Pretty much the only trooper I can rely on to actually hit anything. Name isn't a mispelling of a naughty word, surprisingly, It's that of an old English/Scandinavian king. Has a nice little combo of sprinter, gatling, explosive shells and frenetic. Also a soldier so capable of taking a few more hits than normal. Has a grenade and king of boules too.<br><br><em>Sweep</em><br>My long sought after Comms (once I knew what they do). Like Penfold, he's better at close range which was pretty sucky for me. He has a semi auto shotgun and trigger happy, along with a pistol but let's not dwell on that. Only intresting perk is restless. Spends most of his time reloading.<br><br><em>Pepper</em><br>A sab, but should be a soldier. My designated wave 2 patsy. Is packing bait, commando and heavy armour. Has heartbreaker so sometimes pulls off a cheeky little kill.<br><br><em>Thay</em><br>Just bought him, has heartbreaker though, so let's hope for a CK.<br><br><br>So yeah, now you know when I say my team sucks, you know I mean it.

                Holmes Carne<br>Class: Soldier.<br>Description: The alter-ego of my first trooper.<br>Favorite Weapon: Comanche Auto<br>Other weaps.: Pump action shotgun, shotgun.<br>Equipment: Compensator, Laser Sights, Poison Grenade, Flashbang.<br>Skills: NONE<br>Bio: A star in Exterminating rats, as he has a jar full of them to practice with.<br><br>Firepower: If he had enough munitions, he would have been useful. With only one useful weapon he isn't really good in close-combat. Still, he makes up for it with his excellent aim.                                                                            2.5/5<br><br>Survival: Can probably take two shots on the had before getting killed, and usually is the last surviving trooper on field.<br>                                                                                                                                                                         4/5<br><br>Mobility: Doesn't move much, but that's because he is supposed to, and since he is very rarely targeted, he dismounts opposition.                                                                                                                                                      4.5/5<br><br>Overall: Is contributing a lot to team efforts, and very effective in cleaning up last troopers.                                  4/5<br><br>More troopers coming up, this is the second out of four...

                To update Barbarian has reached his class and although he can level I thought I'd share my thought process now for what I see in him.<br><br>ID: Barbarian<br>Class: Munitions<br>Description: Tactical Long Range Support<br>Favorite Weapon: Infernal Tube<br>Other Weapons: Sniper<br>Equipment: Loader, Bullet Proof Vest<br>Skills: Sprinter, Camouflage<br>Bio: Barbarian is an odd duck on my team.  I since several of my members are already speed rushers, I thought I'd change it up a bit and make a defender styled hit-n-run gunner.  By his earlier levels it seemed like there was no hope for him in specialties, however I see something hopeful in his design with the next few levels.<br><br>-Rating-<br>Firepower: Unlike Fighter who carries around his Infernal Tube quickly, Barbarian is a little more sluggish in it's usage  Sniper as a backup weapon is also a poor choice. (2/5)<br>Survival: This makes it seem like Barbarian is a coward, and it is so.  In order to make full use of his hit-n-run he literally shoots his slow weapons and runs at high speed. (3.5/5)<br>Mobility: Despite carrying 2 heavy weapons, a coward fighter can run very fast... Unless he is reloading. (4/5)<br>Usefulness: Very understated in my army's composition, he isn't quite up to par with the rest of my team.  Not as useless as Wizard but we'll see tomorrow and compare with a level update. (2/5)<br><br>-Additional Special Notes-<br>Someone has been playing my top sub armies lately.  Dunno who or why.<br>Recruit army consists of 108 troops. Capable of reaching raid 14.<br>Consists of 9 Light Tanks, 1 Helicopter, and 2 Heavy Tanks.<br><br>As of Barbarian I have this arrangement order that I'm still working on.<br><br>1. Rogue (Spy deployment, highest priority)<br>2. Paladin (Spy deployment, secondary deployment)<br>3. Fighter (Access to Survival which can not be used if there is no following unit deployment)<br>4. Bard (To assist spies) <br>5. Cleric (To revive important units, Bard for more support and my preferred choice, or Fighter. If Fighter is selected for revival and my second wave is killed he will not use Surival. However if fighter dies and the entire enemy wave is killed with units on my side Fighter will use survival.)<br>6. Wizard (Placeholder, to seperate Comms. Officers from First wave deaths. Can still summon tank from this position.)<br><strong>7. Barbarian</strong> (First wave duo Infernal Tube does not work so well, twice the danger for spies and slower when targeting and target is already dispatched.  I consider this position good in more situations.)<br>8. Ranger (In certain special cases, Ranger can use Talky-Walky to call in the last units, whether it’s Monk or the Savior’d unit if they aren’t already in.)<br>9. Monk (Highest comeback potential unit)<br><br>-Optimal Opening Strategies and Positions-<br>*In a normal 4v4 scenario:<br>Wave 1<br>-Fighter, Bard, Cleric, and Wizard are deployed.<br>-Rogue and Paladin are deployed from the enemy side with only 2 enemies, quickly killed by either before Fighter can shoot off Infernal Tube.  <br>-Bard is on constant aim with Covering Fire to assist spies while being Bait.<br>-If Bard is killed and hopefully is first one killed Cleric will use Savior on him for second wave deployment.<br>Wave 2 (If team is killed)<br>-If Fighter was not taken by Cleric Survival will activate.<br>-Barbarian, Ranger, and Monk are deployed.<br>-Ranger uses Talky-Walky to redeploy Bard.<br><br>*If Wizard deploys with Light Tank<br>Wave 1<br>-Wizard (In Tank), Fighter, and Bard are deployed.<br>-Rogue and Paladin may or may not deploy.<br>-On Point Frenetic Light Tank activates.<br>-Bard and Fighter take aim and cover from behind tank.<br>-Bard resupplies tank.<br>-Victory!
