                I thought it would be a cool idea if each trooper, upon reaching level 11, gets to choose a class specialisation with the options based upon which class they had picked at level 6. It would be good if it has some sort of visual effect on the trooper too, but I can't think of a way it would be compatable with the original helmet (much easier identifier, as there are only 8) and the wife-beater top (completely changing the uniform out of the option). Anyway, I thought up of 4 different specialisations for each class, most relate to the base class ability, though a few are generic and double up with other classes. Here it is:<br><br>Soldier<br>-Infantry: Additional damage with all weapons (1-2)<br>-Combat Sniper: 3x chance of killshot<br>-Shock Trooper: Reloads all guns up to 50% when reinforcements arrive (after munitions bonus, if any, round up)<br>-Super-Soldier: Regenerates HP over time (same rate as poison, when poisoned this trooper's health remains steady)<br><br>Munitions<br>-Quartermaster: No longer limited to 3 pieces of equipment<br>-Fire-Support: Reloads all guns up to 50% when reinforcements arrive (after munitions bonus, round up)<br>-Grenadier: This trooper can use his grenades an infinite number of times, and uses them even more frequently<br>-Weapons Technition: Doubles clip capacity of favoured weapon (does not affect no. of spare rounds)<br><br>Doctor<br>-Practitioner: Bandages cure poison, antidote heals hp, can heal troopers that have already been bandaged before<br>-Juicer: Antidote gives +500 initiative to the affected trooper<br>-Paramedic: Halved healing and cure initiative costs<br>-Battle-Medic: Will not be targetted by enemy troopers so long as there are other allied troopers on field and the enemy is not "smart" (can still be hit from area damage or missfires)<br><br>Spy<br>-Double Agent: Attacks against the spy have increased chance of causing friendly fire on nearby enemies<br>-Assassin: Additional damage with all weapons (1-2)<br>-Counter-Intelligence: All enemy spies that have infiltrated the camp lose 50 initiative when deployed<br>-Infiltrator: Fires equipped weapon instantly at start of battle for no initiative cost if possible (acts before troopers with more initiative due to on-point/suspicious or other spies)<br><br>Saboteur<br>-Sapper: Enemy grenades have a chance of exploding in hand while this trooper is on the field (hits the trooper who used it in the right hand for 1-5 points of damage as well as the usual effects of the grenade, only hits the trooper with the grenade)<br>-Specialist: Reduces the enemy's amry slots by 1 (min 1, works while trooper in reserve)<br>-Demolitionist: Able to score killshots on vehicles (Displays "fuel tank puncture" for gut, "engine malfunction" for heart, "controls broken" for head and "feul-line blockage" for right-lung)<br>-Mine-layer: 3 explosive mines are placed randomly on the field for every Mine-layer in army. Activated when an enemy trooper steps on it, dealing 6-12 damage and sending them airborne. Deals 2x damage to vehicles, does not affect helicopter/jet. (Mines have a glowing light on top that is the same colour as the owners uniform)<br><br>Comms. Officer<br>-Colonel: Whenever this trooper is hit by an enemy, a random ally within range of the attacker (not self) will immediately attack them (misses do not count)<br>-Tactition: Whenever this trooper attacks an enemy, there is a chance that a random ally within range will fire upon them immediately (only the first shot in a burst can trigger this, missed shots still count)<br>-Radio Master: All solo-missions are extended by 15 initiative per levelup, and commando 5 points per levelup (stacks with other Radio Masters)<br>-Comms. Tapper: Enemy army loses 5 comms. points so long as this trooper remains alive (min 0)<br><br>Scout<br>-Ranger: An additional army slot (20 max)<br>-Recon: 150% extra move speed<br>-Sniper: Accurracy doubled with all weapons/grenades<br>-Trapper: Reduces the enemy's army slots by 1 (min 1, works while in reserve)<br><br>Pilot<br>-Ace: Enemy vehicles may be hi-jacked by this trooper during battle, unless they also have the "Ace" ability, throwing the trooper inside on the ground. (not including bike, trooper takes fall damage, reduced by "fall guy") <br>-Mechanic: Pilot can repair allied vehicles (10 base + 2 per level) and vehicles driven by the pilot regenerate hp<br>-Engineer: No longer limited to 3 pieces of equipment<br>-Co-Pilot: All allied troopers (inc. self) have an additional 50% chance to use vehicles for every co-pilot<br><br><br>The "Fire-Support" and "Shock Trooper" abilities load spare bullets into their guns when reinforcements arrive. Weapons under 50% loaded (round up) will be reloaded to 50% using their spare ammo, only after any munitions bonus. Weapons with only 1 capacity would be fully loaded, as it is rounded up from 0.5<br><br>The "Recon" ability is kind of lame at the moment, suggestions would be good<br><br>I am aware that the "Sniper" ability is fairly useless for snipers, and would work better with a rapid-fire weapon<br><br>The "Ace" ability would have similar activation costs and range as the "Wrestler" ability, but obviously different effects. Aces cannot hi-jack each other, as that would lead to constant switching until one dies.<br><br>I'm toying with the idea of the "Juicer" ability also make the doctor's AI believe that every allied trooper is poisoned, and therefore run around "curing" them constantly to give them initiative.<br><br>Any values that aren't listed I haven't decided on. For "Tactition" I'm thinking 30-40% chance, "Sapper" around 50% chance and "Grenadier" doubles the grenade usuage, totalling up to 4x frequency due to the base munitions ability. This is completely open to suggestion though.<br><br>Anyway, tell me what you think of it.

                @doom: the reason why I chose lvl 11 is because it is 10 levelups from the start, same as why lvl 6 is chosen (5 from start). Although, most of the abilities I've got don't go up per level, as it seems rather pointless considering they won't levelup much from there on, and if they did some would get rather overpowered.<br><br>@master: I absolutely love the name "Reverse Engineer". Creeper looks like a good idea, only sometimes forcing a retreat would be beneficial to the enemy, perhaps it could give a new status effect; fear, where the affected trooper has halved accuracy because he's trembling with fear? (countered by death grip/compensator) You're probably right about juicer giving too much initiative, 300 would be better, or 150 if it can be used on non poisoned troopers too. Drug dealer looks like a good change, as that would circumvent the silliness of applying bandages to already bandaged wounds, though I don't like the idea of it using an item slot, but as it stands it would be too overpowered if it didn't.<br><br>@buzz: lol, you're probably right there, maybe I should find a way for this game to actually get revenue so they invest in making it better, because as it stands it is original and has great potential.

                I could see a version of this game eventually appearing on Muxxu.  My guess is that the version online now is essentially a beta version.  If you look at the Muxxu version of My Brute it has features the original version doesn't.
