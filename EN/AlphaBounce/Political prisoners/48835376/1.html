                <p>You are a prisoner, on a life sentence. It is unknown whether it has been decided as so justly or unjustly, as the player's actions and life before the game begins are unknown, but the ending to the game suggests a working, healthy and just society is currently active in this futuristic scenario. But I think it is safe to say that, if there are truly as many prisoners to maintain as the game introduction suggests, a fault in the judiciaire system is evident, whatever the reason for your imprisonment is.</p><p>It is also unknown whether all these prisoners are human like you are. The FURI supporters found in the game claim that the human expansion has come to encounter hundreds of thousands of planets, and, at least in the Zonkerian system to which you are sent, intelligent life is abundant and varied. It is mentioned that the ESCorp's actions specifically in the galaxy have been, for the most part, negative, and it is assumable with all context present that, most definitely, the human expansion has been incredibly relevant for any living beings in the nearby universe. The FURI liberations suggest that actually, most ESCorp prisoners aren't human. They are aliens that <em>need to be freed</em>.</p><p>The so-called <em>"Merchants' Guild"</em> includes tens or hundreds of shops in this system, and it is unclear on to whom they mostly give their services to. It could be that most of these shops sell artifacts to prisoners like you, making it evident that there are many, <em>many</em> in a relatively small area (confirmed by the FURI liberations), and/or that there is, simply, a <em>lot</em> of alien traffic in Zonkeria specifically or in most of the galaxy. Either way, this just shows just how much more significant the ESCorp's actions are, as their harmful consequences impact <em>uncountable lives of all origins</em>.</p><p>Soon after you start the game, you encounter a member of the human race, of name Douglas. This is the first, last, and only of your kind that you see in the entire game, and he dies in just a matter of days. As he told you, he had been a prisoner of the ESCorp his entire life, and his hopes for freedom had faded. He was sent to this same system more than a century ago, but near a far-away planet named Samosa. This gives the user the thought and feeling that things are definitely not exactly the way they are made to seem, and that there might be more to know about. This man was offered a chance for freedom and achieved absolutely nothing more than a life of complete solitude: Could the user really hope that he will be given more than that, or should he suspect of immoral treatment?</p><p>After you perform some mining operations for the ESCorp, to serve your sentence, you are told of an alien race that has been causing trouble recently. The ESCorp asks you to leave your mining duties, and go full on <em>attacking</em> their home planet, inducing fear on them, so that they stop being a problem. You are asked to do a very dirty job, but this time, under the <em>promise</em>, that the ESCorp will free you of all charges and send you back to Earth a free man, shall the duty be finished successfully.<br>However, this does not end up to be the case. Upon attacking the entire surface of planet Balixt, the ESCorp gives an excuse, saying that they couldn't get their lawyers to successfully appeal for your freedom. This hints at one of two things:<br>1.Your crimes are significant enough that whatever heroic and relevant actions you took in name of the human race weren't able to make your freedom reviewable.<br>2.The ESCorp wants to keep you, as you are useful to them, and they impose their interests over your quality of life and the just commemoration for your feats. They were and are basically speaking bullshit.</p><p>The ending to the game, though, in which you can choose to live a peaceful life on Earth after the media scandals at the reveal of the ESCorp's immoral "ways to do things", greatly supports the second option. Clearly, the crimes that awarded you a life sentence weren't important enough that they prevented you from freely living a healthy life on a working society next to other human beings, without you being a threat to them, or society itself. The ESCorp is then confirmed to be not just a threat and immoral to alien races and the order of the galaxy itself, but also seen as so in the eyes of normal human society, which was actually not aware of what has been taking place for decades, or even centuries. The ESCorp, clearly, has been recently or all along been working varely in, or even outside, of the laws of human order and the laws of human sense and morality.</p><br><p>It is unknown whether the ESCorp is the only one. It is unknown whether humanity is actually seen like this all over the galaxy, when such actions are only the result of a few master companies and individuals, or if this is the exception. FURI members' claims suggest that it is not the exception, but the rule: Humans have accidentally become an universal threat, and you became a workman to fulfill human objectives of explosive and murderous expansion.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><p><img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/icons/small_bricks.gif" alt=":ab_mission_10:" class="tid_ico"><br><img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/favicon.ico" alt=":ab:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>More soon.</p>
