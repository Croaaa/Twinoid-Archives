                Okay, so the PCs of AlphaBounce are prisoners. But why was yours put in prison? Make up a story here. ^_^<br> <br> My character, Destinii Reimu Haruya, was a serial killer. She took trips on people's spacecraft then, when they weren't looking, set them on course for a black hole and escaped in the escape pod. She was caught when a rich merchant caught her retracking his ship.

                So I will make RP too!<br> <br> My beginning<br> I came here from the Earth, spying Minicitys. I was playing Club Penguin, and used trainers on one of my characters. The ESCorp took a look on Earth and thinked:<br> -"He is a bad human. Maybe we will take that tiny creature to ours?"<br> So ESCorp ships boomed a lazor beam on Earth. No one except me had feeled that. I slept for a few hours. When I woke up, I discovered, that I am in a pad-like ship. Then I received instructions from ESCorp, about "envelopes". Duh? I played it, and then took a long break... but returned now!<br> <br> More RP soon.

                The planet was shaking, i knew something was not right. I opened the window. I saw a bomb, i know this could only mean one thing, the destruction of Kabonis. (or whatever the planet was.) I had to get off this planet, but i knew only one way, hitch-hiking. I got out and quickly ran to the nearest space-port, but alas, there was too much of a crowd to escape. I quickly noticed a open craft, taking off in about 10 min and i seized the opportunity, i climbed over the fence, landing face-down in the dirt as i did so, and ran into the ship. I quickly took off my spacesuit, seeing that this ship's pilots at least breathed O2. When the 10 min was up i gradually wondered what was wrong, the ship hadn't taken off! I looked at the cockpit to see what was wrong, my worst fears where confirmed, they where dead. Naturally i hid them in the closet and started up the engines, i wasn't going to be accused of killing them, was i? At Soupaline, my home planet, i stopped to re-fuel. Here's where my plan went backwards. I glanced at a Tri-D screen and saw a graphic destruction of Kabonis, the place i called home for 5 years. Seeing this anyone with the tiniest bit of sense would cry, and that's what i did. I cried so hard that when the space-port manager asked if he could check my ship, i said yes in a wobbly tone and he went in. 2 minutes later he emerged, turned the dead-lock-a key that all spaceships have that stop them from being unlocked from their key-and came towards me and knocked me out!. The next thing i remember is waking up in my envelope, at 0|0.<br> <br> Bit wordy i know but it's my history...

                Political activism against ESCorp, though the kind of that's behind-the-scenes.<br> <br> OOC: I just realized that the English Channel's (and the Spanish's one's I guess) name can imply more about the world of AB than previously thought. It will help if anyone else is aware of the political situation in Ace Combat 3, as I suspect this is a very similar one: there's no real government; in it's place, mega-corporations rule and hold political power. This could easily explain why ESCorp is so damn big a corporation and why it is allowed to even imprison people in it's own kind of prison while making a whole lot of sense at the same time.

No? Wiki it. It was a planet that blew up in 16428. Well, back then I was in charge of transferring hydrogen from Jupiter to Earth in order to power the world. Literally. Each tanker (I did 4 trips a year, and there were 5 of us, so 20/year) carried enough hydrogen to power the entire world for 3 weeks. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_keepcool.gif" alt="X)"><br> <br> While I was passing through the asteroid belt, an asteroid hit my left engine. It is possible to remain on a straight trajectory with only one engine, but I wasn't skilled enough to do that. Thus, the tanker curved to the left, on a due course for Mars. The only thing I could do was eject in the escape pod and watch as the tanker crashed into Mars, dooming it, and the colonies on it. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_cry.gif" alt=":pleure:"><br> <br> I was charged with 4,839 counts of murder, and sentenced to life in prison. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_nooo.gif" alt=":noon:"><br> <br> Since, then, unfortunately, it seems that I've forgotten my name. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P">

                I challenge you! There are 2 things I am good at: 1. Playing games 2. Telling stories. So B R I N G I T O N<strong>!</strong><br> <br> I was sitting on a chair and playing computer games. I went to a link that I thought was a game site. After clicking that link my computers screen turned black. I tried turning it back on put it was no use. Suddenly I felt that there were like some kind of pulses coming from the computer. After that everything mechanical started acting weird. Then they all shot some kind of pulses back to the computer. Then I saw that a 1x1 pixel blinking green dot came to the up-left corner of the screen. It went to the right side of the screen. Then 1 pixel down. Then to the left side of the screen and so on and on. After a few rows I saw that every pixel it had went over turned some kind of color and that a picture was forming. If I would have not been so interested of what would happen I would have ran away. So after a few minutes it was complete. It looked like the game site I was trying to access earlier. Suddenly I felt that instead of using the keyboard and mouse I could use my brain to do stuff in there. It was like this really cool game and I totally forgot those weird things before. There was this picture on the left side showing some videos of some kind of platform that bounced a ball against some bricks. On the right I saw a button register and I clicked it. It required me to fill in some fields. So I did and clicked the button register. Then the computers screen turned black again. The outlines started disappearing and it was turning circular. Suddenly it started sucking me in but so weakly at first that I did not understand it. i felt that it had gotten too weird now and started going away but the sucking got stronger. It was turning into a black hole except that instead of sucking EVERYTHING it only sucked me and my house. So when I was up in my room (My room is right above the room of where the computer is in.) I felt like gravity had gotten really strong and I could not stand up anymore. I felt like I was gonna be squashed into the floor. Luckily/Unluckily the floor started breaking and it and I went in that black hole. I saw that everything that had came in here was placed directly at the place it usually is. So some things were floating in air. More things came in and went to their right places after 15 minutes or so the whole house was complete. Out of the houses sides were coming some weird things that made the house look like a platform. I then remembered that my house now looked just like that yellow platform thingy that was bouncing the ball to some bricks. I understood that I was now IN that game. It shot my house back out from that black hole but I did not appear on the place I lived before but I was in space. I went to check the computer and that game was there so I started playing and everything I did actually happened to me. I was now the prisoner of ESCorp.<br> <br> Sorry for it being so short but I had to go to a shop with my mother right away. So I hope you like it anyway.

                RP fan reports on duty!<br> <br> <br> Earth... Yes, I still remember it. Beautifull colorfull spacecrafts flying every way they could, magnificent skyscrapers... And ESCorp so-called "police". There are organisations that has no political power, there are those which have a lot. But ESCorp... They are beyond the scale. They were the ones who discovered how to mine space. And that proved to be the greatest idea of mankind. At least in their way of saying it, without taking moral consequences into consideration.<br> Power corrupts, everyone knows that. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and that's the kind they got. Soon whole earth was at their feet, resistance was fultile. And that's also what I thought. I was doing my job, trying not to get in their way. But with ESCorp that is not an option. They started to catch people to do their minings for free. They waged wars on aliens to get slaves, but that was not enough. So they enslavend mankind. Finally they also got me. And so I am lost in space looking for ways of revange...

                I was part of a group that had every legal right to try saying goodbye to the rest of the world, but nobody else wanted to see it that way...you see, the modern world has given us the combination of global networks and staggeringly wealthy eccentrics, but a few with power and pure thought cannot overpower the many. A bunch of us with similar mindsets were invited to a single internet meeting place and then there was the one who invited us. He had told us that he was extremely wealthy and thought that we could do better outside of the confines of normal society. We were skeptical, but when we visited the small artificial island built 600 km into international waters it was impossible to keep that mindset. Few declined the opportunity to leave civilization for the new world. Life was good, though who can accept what is good if it's not theirs? To many nonbeing is better than something being another's, so the fighting began...we defended our borders as well as we could, but nation after nation, and who even knows if they were acting alone or as one entity with a greater purpose, was too much for a nation of a few thousand to defend against. I understand that those of us who survived are all ESCorp...and I could make any little conspiracy theory up at this point, but what matters is that we were and for some, some with great power, that was too much...

                Well, at first i worked for ESCorp as the janitor. Then, I  tried to refer the chairman of ESCorp to <strong>MyBrute.</strong> He didnt like it, so he fired me. <br> <br> I took it up with the union of janitors, and they sent me an attourney to file my case. She was really attractive. Too attractive. Lets just say that SHE ended up filing a case against ME.<br> <br> So there i was, between a rock and a hard place. Then I decided to join an extremist religious cult to attack ESCorp. Using my experience as janitor and knowledge of the ESCorp compound, i led a team throughout the facility, referring as many workers to <strong>MyBrute</strong> as possible.<br> <br> Security forces arrived, and i was briskly taken away and sent on the first transport envelope to [0,0]

                My name was Patrick Atres. I was game developer.<br> <br> One day, I have got an email from my old friend, Bob. He wanted visit him at Moltear (I lived in Soupaline). So I did this. He gave me some games (he was game developer too) and said that they are mine. I didn't knew that they weren't released.<br> Then, two days later, I woke up at envelope. "What the..." - I said. But then, when I was talking with one ESCorp guy by radio, he said that I had some pirate games. Then I realized that Bob did this.

                I was sent to prison in 2009. I was a pirate, tearing through rough seas day and night (this was Maytime, so I was looking forward to the calmer weather). I had just stolen a map called ye olde worlde PID map. It had a set of co-ordinates and was entitled Deviceings Terre.<br> It was a wierd thing but apparently it was valuable, so I tore it up and shared it between myself and my 43 shipmates.<br> The next day, the Jolly ESCorp ship jumped ships and stole me map, and our wonderful ship cap'n, my very self <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_wink2.gif" alt=":wink:"><br> I found myself In the centre of the universe, at 0,0.

                Well, this is my story...<br> <br> I was a merchant, travelling from star system to star system, planet to planet. But I wasn't an ordinary merchant. I was - if I remember correctly - a planet seller. I had just got enough money to buy a planet , so I did. I sold it for billions of minerals. Then, just as the buyers ship landed on the planet, I blew the planet into pieces, along with the unsuspecting buyer. Unfortunately, he was a ECorp officer, so his ship's destruction was soon heard by ECorp. I tried to flee, but they had missiles. I silently readied the hyperspace boosters, but I was too late. They fired the missiles , and I was blown away. I would have been killed if I didn't quickly use the safety pod. The next time I woke up, I was in a cell watched by ECorp guards. I saw that my cell was named, "B E N J Y 8", so I decided that it would be my name from now on.<br> <br> Wow, my story is long! The reason Benjy8 is my name is because I never actually had a name before, to help stay out of the way of the law.

                (Totally in the mood for something like this!)<br> <br> "So you wanna know a bit about what I, Azure Chocobo, did...eh?" I swiveled in my chair, chewing on a swizzle stick from my coffee I got the morning before. It was obvious I wasn't about to spit it out until I got a newer one to replace it.<br> <br> My back crackles and pops as I stretch upwards, reaching for a small pocket in the upper compartments of my desk and drag out a file. It was thick, with notes and status flyers prodding out of it. A couple of prison photos drizzle from the side onto the floor, and I hurriedly pick them up and jam them back in place again.<br> <br> "See, I was caught doing some traffick'in." I cough, pulling out a First Offense Refferral. "Illegal sales of SHC. Yeah, I know what yer thinkin', I'm some crazed merchant, right? Wrong; I was handin' 'em off to some interstellar fugitives fer free, stealin' them from a stockpile."<br> <br> I pull out another form, this time it was coated in prison sentences. "After a few months of solitar' confinement, I was let off, and this time, lived a pretty legit life, till I got into my old habits again and  I wasn't let off so easily."<br> <br> I hold up my arm, revealing handcuff marks. "These things don't get off easy, you know."<br> <br> "So after a few years, ESCorp decided to keep me around longer. Thought I would be an 'asset'." The swizzle stick gets more and more gnarled as my teeth dig into the plastic out of disdain and hate. "Feh."<br> <br> I then turn to my mocking voice, clearly making fun of an official. "SO MISS AZURE, HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR PUNY LIL' ENVELOPE." I wave my hands in an extravagant manner; I get people would think I was insane. "YOU'LL BE DRILLIN' FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, DOIN' LITTLE GO-FOR MISSIONS FOR US! I BET YOU LOOOOOOOVE THAT!"<br> <br> I calm a little, slumping into my chair. It seems that I'm just a crazed psycho who had one too many espressos.<br> <br> "So now you know." I growl, flicking my hand, not caring much to reveal the ofter offences I made. "Go away, I got clean-ups to do."

                I'm going to make a new one: What does your character do in prison?<br> <br> But for now, my story (Which, BTW, is going in the OP of that thread)<br> <br> <br> <br> <strong>I woke up one day, looking out to the oh-so-fammiliar landscape... </strong> I thought to myself, "Didn't I move house?" I then realised i had, but the landscape is so equal on Earth now that everything is basically a never ending plain extending in all directions. I think to myself, "Well, we deserved it" and get dressed for work. Not that there was any, Earth was long cleared of <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_mineral.gif" alt=":mineral:"> for ESCorps "Private Funding". This probably means that they are waiting to get enough money to blow up this place, so that they can move on to a "More Profitable" planet.<br> <br> At work, there was less people than normal, infact, there was none at all. Being slightly spooked, I go to my office and find on my desk a note addressed to me. Naturally i open it, and in it there were 3 pieces of paper. The first one said "Run", The second said "You have 10 seconds to get out" and the third said nothing. I turned it over to see who it was from and noticed my boss' name. I ran. 7 seconds later i was out. I looked at the second page again. The 10 had changed to 2, 1 and then finally 0. As soon as I saw it say 0, I heard gunfire. Followed by an explosion. I looked over my head and saw the smouldering remains of my workplace. As i turned i managed to see the ghost of a invi-ship in the air. Because of the nature of invisability--that is, that nothing really is, you can always see a haze--i saw the frount of the ship. It had four letters on it, F, U, R and I. "Furi" I muttered, keeping a mental note of that name, and i ran back home. When i got home I saw a squad of officals arround it. I tapped the neerest one on the shoulder, intending to ask what was wrong when i saw his helmet. F.U.R.I. I remember no more exept being yanked back. Probaly by a claw-esque thing.<br> <br> I then found myself on a ship, crusing in GeoStationary orbit. I could tell because of the size of the Earth. After a brief look around i found myself face to face with another human, this one with a plasma rifle. And cloths that looked surprisingly like FURI's, exept instead of FURI it said ESCorp. "Did it HAVE to be these guys?" I in-audibly mutter. The soldier took me to a room and said one thing at the door, "Debriefing." I go inside out of nesisity, it didn't look like i had a choice. While i was going in i took a sneak-peek at the last page, it had changed. It said "Not yet". Surprisingly startled by this i was usherd into the room where i was told exactly what happend. FURI had found the PID code to earth, FURI had blown up the mine where i had work and then blew up my house. Startled by this i sat down patiently waiting to hear the rest of what happend.<br> "You have been saved by us" said the person on the stage.<br> "Really?" said I.<br> "Yes, we saw the situation from our orbit and pulled you in. It took only 3 seconds whitch is why you are not dead by now."<br> "Thank you then"<br> "No need to thank me, as we saved your life, according to section AZB, subsection 8, quad secion 13, you now belong to ESCorp, because we saved your life."<br> "Great... So, what am i to do?"<br> "We have 2 options for you, become one of our test subjects or live a life of freedom, with some restrictions."<br> "I'll take the freedom! Who knows what you might do to me."<br> "Good. Step this way"<br> <br> If you can't guess what happens next, start a new acc. It happens the first thing.

                I, Dragax67 am a prisoner for many reasons. First, my real name is Tyler Zyrax and I am a young Dragon-Human from Planet Lycans twin, Drkaonis. So nowhere near the area i was escorted to. <br> <br> Reason One for my inprisonment was the EsCorp ruler hated Dragonkind, especially Human crossbreeds. So every year, at least 250 dragonkind are taken.<br> <br> The second reason is that I am a rebel. I often tried to break into EsCorp ships to free dragons and other prisoners. I often succeeded along with a group, but one time, I entered alone. I nearly was caught.<br> <br> The third reason: Possessing An EsCorp Missile pack. i stole it from a nearby ship and helped drill my home planet to gain minerals and special bonuses for our ships. I work, even though being young...<br> <br> My final reason is murder. Five EsCorp officials tried to arrest me for joining a group of Fighters who attacked and often abused EsCorp officials. When attacked by them, I fought back and killed 2, while leaving one with huge gashes across his body, one neutered, and the other with 3rd degree burns.<br> <br> I didn't mean any of it. I can barely control a ship and here I am, doing slave labour for a company that doesn't even feed me... A tleast I get about 10<img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_mineral.gif" alt=":mineral:"> a day, 3<img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel_free.gif" alt=":free:">capsules a day, and some<img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel.gif" alt=":fuel:">capsules for helping out and doing missions.

                Well, Shia, though a full RP admittedly might not have too much substance to it...it's still a lot of fun making a post or two about why your guy is in prison. I'd make another post about my guy's fate in a second since it was sorta fun to write the first <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:">

                Amen to that.<br> <br> However, an avid roleplayer is able to take any situation and turn it into a story, regardless. Though, I wouldn't take most players to be one.<br> <br> I guess if the setting was some sort of lounge where prisoners and free beings could settle down and tell tales, comparing their knowledge and such, it could work. Albeit it would be generic...

                I was arrested for something I now dont want remember, Placed in an over crowded prison with twenty back to back live sentences for one small computer virus...<br> <br> Well the Virus was unique so to say, it was designed to be passed by atm cards, stick an infected card in an atm machine effect the machine, swipe an infected card in a credit slot boom the terminal was infected. It was a glorious virus in that aspect. The AI of the virus was designed to hide and spread until the turn of the year or it had infected the entire planet which ever had came first.<br> <br> I was not expecting the virus to infect the planet in three weeks.<br> <br> Its payload was to disrupt the entire banking system of Mars. It never was to touch Terre, but it did. Oh lord it did. I was found a week after Mars collapsed under the decimated monetary system. Because of the one bank that went down on earth.<br> <br> Terre Authorities were able to trace and locate my tags in the programing which lead to my Arrest. I will say the trial was almost a sham, not even my lawyer tried to defend me he sold me up river because his brother was an owner of one the Mars banks.<br> <br> I spent the first part of my term on the over crowded IO prison Moon, When ESCorp was looking for ahem gunny pigs to try their mining platforms for Rehab of Criminal Offenders. I turned down the offer multiple times.<br> <br> My Two cell mates Khelben and Bloodtears took the chance at their first opportunity. I while stationed at the IO prison Moon waited, ESCorp had made some of the logs from the miners available. Two days ago I had seen an entry that Khelben had posted, apparently he has found a way to get away. Now I think I may see a glimmer of hope here. If he was able to find information on how to get away from the system then I may find a way to return to Terre and Extract my revenge on the Banks and the Courts.<br> <br> Wait a Minute did I see someone say they blew up mars?  How long was I in IO Prison?

                :fumbles with the old radio logs and runs into Vasq retelling the time on IO Prison.::<br> <br> Ye had to mention that rat hole? Well aside from Bloody the mind wiper does not seem to work on those who do not give into it, you can resist it. Vasq I will say for such a smart programmer you never figured that one out?<br> <br> Ok since the other guys have bore their souls I will also. I am no stranger to the Mining envelope technology. I was at one time a member of a Geological exploratory mission trying to find new worlds for Us humans to move on to. The Ship we were assigned on while in deep space was attacked by an Alien life force, Having no real weapons other then the Old style Ping Pong miner systems, otherwise Known as Vehicular Assisted Utility System or the VAUS for short. We had defeated the Life force at least three different times on our journey back to earth. But we had not realized it had not died only hidden and followed us.<br> <br> During our journey back we had found alien tech that had upgraded our Vaus Systems but only one at a time. In the time between our return and the day the life force had found its way to earth we had sold the tech to some of the Mining companies for them to reverse engineer.<br> <br> The day the life force had attacked no one on earth had known about it. The life force had built a massive wall around the system to start consuming the life trapped with in its walls.<br> <br> The mining companies who were out testing the Reverse Engineered capsules were the ones to discover the wall and destroy it. Those mining companies merged into ESCorp... The newly formed ESCorp had informed the government of what it had just defeated... This caused the whole Crew of the ship I was on to be Quarantined and arrested for bringing an interstellar monster to Earth.<br> <br> What is now know as the Envelopes is the Reverse Engineered VAUS system. The ESCorp had found the new systems doubled its profit tenfold and soon had grown big enough to that the areas to mine were more then the trained crew they had.<br> <br> During the Battle with the life Force the ESCorp had reverse Engineered one piece of tech from the remains of that life force, the Indirection Engine., an Engine so powerful it was able to Randomly Move a solar system and planets around. They traded that tech to the Earth Government for the protection of the Planet in exchange for the use of its Prison Population to Keep its mining profits up.<br> <br> The Earth now Randomly moves around the Galaxy due to this deal but always in a predefined Interstellar Direction or a P.I.D. mapping. ESCorp being the ones who gave Earth that tech always know where it is to Acquire more Prisoners but those of us who are in the Envelopes there are only rumors on how to get there.<br> <br> All of this History happened while I was Imprisoned in the IO correctional Facility where Eventually I was joined by Vasq and Bloodtears.<br> <br> Knowing the basic prehistory of ESCorp and how to handle a Primitive Envelope I personally jumped at the opportunity to get back out in space.<br> <br> Now this is where people are going to be scratching their heads after all this question is asked over and over "ESCorp has been in business for a couple thousand  years at this point, how could you have been a miner in those Ancient times...?"<br> <br> I/O prison is very unique in its treatment of prisoners, If you are to say suppose to serve 266 consecutive life sentences for nearly bringing Ruination to Life as we know it when you get old they have found ways to Rejuvenate your body via Nanite technology injected into the blood stream to the Approx age of 18 so you can serve the next sentence. I was on my sixth Rejuvenation cycle when my Cell block was offered the chance at the ESCorp miner Release Program. So I dont fear growing old any more the Nanites are programed to Restore me nineteen more times, to ensure I serve my full Sentence.<br> <br> Hence why I want to Escape ESCorp and hit the wild Edges of space, maybe if I am lucky I can find a way of Ridding my body of the Nanites and finally getting the Peace I want...<br> <br> Unlike Blood Tears who has only to serve his sentence all the way out and earn redemption, Or vasq who wants revenge against Earth. I just want to be able to die a normal death... the peace that Douglas has now gotten is something that will be denied me, so I count him as Lucky and use his Envelope in memory of his release.<br> <br> There you go the Full story now anyone got a way of Debugging this Cruddy Windows version they put in these blasted envelopes or maybe a Hyperlinux shell so I can reprogram the blasted thing.<br> <br> And Vasq what do you expect IO Prison was notorious about using Cryo-injection tech to calm down hyper prisoners.  You probably had served your whole term in that cell on IO, but they do not count the time that your Put to sleep.  It does not shock me that someone blew up Mars while we were in that stinking hole.<br> <br> Khelben<br> Former I/O prisoner
