                Hey. I just wanted to share my thoughts on Alpha Bounce.<br> <br> For one thing, it's an excellent Breakout game, with precise ball-meets-paddle physics, great visuals, a good selection of powerups and powerdowns, and a unique storyline. Though I'm not certain if anyone would agree, but I think the admins should come back and spice up Alpha Bounce a bit. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":innocent:"><br> <br> The thing is, I make suggestions for a wide variety of different games on other sites, and since I myself have gotten very into Breakout/Arkanoid clones, I know how one could be made with little to no flaws. The current version of Alpha Bounce is fun to play <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_yeah.gif" alt=":youpi:">, and future versions, if they are to come, will possibly hold up and drive the success of the title to new levels of greatness. These features to improve Alpha Bounce I recommend strongly, though none are required.<br> <br> <strong>When you enter Nightmare mode, allow the player to switch back and forth to Normal and Nightmare modes, so that the player can still continue playing on normal difficulty so they can gain 100% completion after finding and completing Earth.<br> </strong>If it isn't possible already, when being fired by the ESCorp for traveling beyond the Karbonis Belt, the player should be able to find retail sellers that sell envelope extensions that were previously given up due to deactivation.<br> <strong>I think that the lowest number of lives you can do a level with should be 3, not just one. It's not to decrease the difficulty, but to make the game seem a little more fair to everyone.<br> </strong><strong>Therefore, the game's max starting limit of lives would be seven. No more than that.<br> </strong>When it comes to gem/mineral blocks, only the ones destroyed and collected would become inactive defunct ones on replays of the level. This includes beating the level without all of them being destroyed, or eliminating them with powerups that would prevent the <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_mineral.gif" alt=":mineral:"> (s) from being collected inside, mainly [G], [O],and [Q].<br> <strong>Rather than only having set powerups to appear in set levels, one of all powerups should have a 30% chance of being spawned from a normal brick, with the more useful ones (like [K] or [P]) having a lower spawn ratio compared to others.<br> </strong>The ball's acceleration rate in levels I feel is a little too fast. Maybe slow it or wait until 3/4 of the normal blocks are destroyed before the ball begins speeding up.<br> *If the [U] powerup ever becomes available in this version of Alpha Bounce, it should stand for "U"ltra and allow the ball to rip through any brick, like in many other brick-breaking games.<br> <br> This should hopefully cover it for now.

                What you said sounds nice and dandy... but there are a couple of problems with that... <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"><br> <br> 1) it would make the game too easy <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P"><br> <br> 2) nobody is gonna update the game anymore. they haven't updated it for a long while now, so even if there were some nice things that could be changed about it, there's no one to do it. the devs are busy with other games

                I know the admins have abandoned development on Alpha Bounce, but these were recommendations incase god forbid the admins returned. <br> <br> Well I'd accept any challenge, but for a block-busting game such as this one, some features do make the game seem a little less fair than it should be. Many old arcade games have the player start with three lives, which can be adjusted to five or in rare cases, seven. So I was thinking that rather than just beginning with one and increasing it to five, you'd begin with three and instead increase it to seven, so therefore you keep the lives number above average, which is a number everyone would be used to, or common sense if you will.<br> <br> The ball's increase in speed just happens way too early, and it never stops accelerating until you die, or finish the level. Not really a big deal, but it still feels strange in comparison to other games of the same genre.<br> <br> The paddle controls are another thing that bugs me, which I forgot to list. While it does help in aiming the ball, the paddle being able to go off the screen is kind of annoying, as I've lost many lives when my mouse cursor was off the screen to do other tasks.<br> <br> The random powerup generation would still make the harder-to-find powerups still rare, but in keeping with the spirit of many block-breaking games, it would allow every type of powerup to spawn from a destroyed (normal) block, even if only specific blocks are chosen to deposit a powerup. So therefore common powerups like [E] and [M] would still appear very often, and vice versa.

                <strong>sigh</strong> <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?"><br> <br> Again, no attempts of any negativity towards other users.<br> <br> <cite>If this was implemented, ESCorp/FURI would be unbalanced.</cite><br> <br> Well I only just started playing the game, so I'm not sure if FURI gives you paddle extensions once you join their side, to make up for the fact that you initially gave them up when the ESCorp booted you.<br> <br> <cite>How is this more "fair"? Why stop at 7? Why not infinite? That's certainly the most "fair", no?</cite><br> <br> I meant that 7 lives was the max number that you could start a level with, as lives reset to a specific amount after each level. The reason why starting a level with only one or two lives I consider unfair is because if you've played the DSi version, you know how irritating it is to lose and have to retry the level. You lose your last, and sometimes only life, the losing BGM plays, you're <em>booted back to the map</em>, you re-choose the level, hit Play, wait for it to <em>load again</em>, and then after <em>all that</em>, you <em>finally</em> are able to restart the level. Wow; What a project. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_huh.gif" alt=":huh:"><br> <br> This in all honesty is why I prefer the online version over the DSi one. Sure there are ways to start a level with only one paddle and no additional ones if done just right, but restarting a level, at the cost of just one extra <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel.gif" alt=":fuel:">, is a much simpler and faster method than what was described above.<br> <br> <cite>Based on some of your suggestions, this statement almost seems contradictory. You would accept any challenge, yet your suggestions would make the game so much easier that there would be almost no sense of challenge anywhere.</cite><br> <br> The suggestions, in your opinion, would possibly lower the game's difficulty, but in mine, it would remove complaints about players receiving cheap deaths because a lethal projectile gets in the way of the drilling ball when the paddle goes to catch it and keep it in play. The challenge should come from level design, and other gimmicks, with each clone having their own offering to challenge the player. Very much every Breakout clone, both modern and ancient, starts the player with a healthy supply of lives, with the minimum starting amount arcade ones could be set to would usually be 2, but rarely you'd see someone cheap enough to set the starting amount to that to rack in extra quarters.<br> <br> Another thing about the hazards. The only things that I recommend should kill the player aside from losing the ball are projectiles aimed at the paddle. The Death/Skull blocks make this part cheap as the casual player usually  just aims to hit the ball and not really steer it. I can understand as when you get farther you'll proceed to learn how to steer the ball properly, but just incase, I just mentioned that for kicks.<br> <br> <cite>Why are you doing other tasks while playing a level?</cite><br> <br> My life isn't devoted to Alpha Bounce; and plus, I'm a busy guy.<br> <br> <cite>Nonetheless, the game is considered finished, so all the admins will do is fix any major bugs that may suddenly appear.</cite><br> <br> I wrote these because just incase an admin returned and began updating the game, that could take my ideas into consideration.<br> <br> Overall, I apologize for any misunderstanding and troubles. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(">

                <cite>Well I only just started playing the game, so I'm not sure if FURI gives you paddle extensions once you join their side, to make up for the fact that you initially gave them up when the ESCorp booted you.</cite><br> Being in FURI allows you to gain certain items at the cost of a permanently shorter pad. Some would argue that FURI's items are better than ESCorp's items overall, and the effect of pad length can make people either lean toward ESCorp or FURI.<br> <br> <cite>I meant that 7 lives was the max number that you could start a level with, as lives reset to a specific amount after each level. The reason why starting a level with only one or two lives I consider unfair is because if you've played the DSi version, you know how irritating it is to lose and have to retry the level. You lose your last, and sometimes only life, the losing BGM plays, you're booted back to the map, you re-choose the level, hit Play, wait for it to load again, and then after all that, you finally are able to restart the level. Wow; What a project. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_huh.gif" alt=":huh:"><br> <br> This in all honesty is why I prefer the online version over the DSi one. Sure there are ways to start a level with only one paddle and no additional ones if done just right, but restarting a level, at the cost of just one extra <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel.gif" alt=":fuel:">, is a much simpler and faster method than what was described above.</cite><br> I haven't played the DSi one, but considering you have unlimited plays as soon as you get the game...<br> <br> <cite>The suggestions, in your opinion, would possibly lower the game's difficulty, but in mine, it would remove complaints about players receiving cheap deaths because a lethal projectile gets in the way of the drilling ball when the paddle goes to catch it and keep it in play. The challenge should come from level design, and other gimmicks, with each clone having their own offering to challenge the player. Very much every Breakout clone, both modern and ancient, starts the player with a healthy supply of lives, with the minimum starting amount arcade ones could be set to would usually be 2, but rarely you'd see someone cheap enough to set the starting amount to that to rack in extra quarters.</cite><br> Alphabounce is free. People only pay if they want to play more in less time. With those lethal projectiles, you're supposed to find different ways to survive, and there are tools in the game to help you accomplish that. No matter how you look at it, adding more lives makes the game overall easier.<br> <br> <cite>Another thing about the hazards. The only things that I recommend should kill the player aside from losing the ball are projectiles aimed at the paddle. The Death/Skull blocks make this part cheap as the casual player usually just aims to hit the ball and not really steer it. I can understand as when you get farther you'll proceed to learn how to steer the ball properly, but just incase, I just mentioned that for kicks.</cite><br> Typically, levels with death bricks have ways that allow you have extra balls in play, such as a few [M] and/or [N] powerups, so you won't lose a life everytime you a ball hits a death brick.<br> <br> <cite>My life isn't devoted to Alpha Bounce; and plus, I'm a busy guy.</cite><br> Yeah, but if you're playing and need to do something, you should either finish playing the level or pause the game.

                Okay, now that I'm thinking about it, I should stop mentioning the additional lives part. I know you can find equipment to aid yourself in certain situations, but in regards to the ESCorp vs. FURI thing, I want to know if it's possible to obtain the Lithium Retrofuser, the four FORA 7R-Z Mines, and the AR-SRX missiles, cross the Karbonis Belt with less than 52 cleaning missions, lose the paddle extensions, join the FURI, and then get their upgrades, and keep everything excluding the paddle extensions.<br> <br> I know this will not happen, but I wish there was a way to upon joining the FURI, somehow re-joining the ESCorp as an undercover FURI agent, and thus being able to 100% the entire game with every item possible in one's inventory and then opting to not go into Nightmare mode upon completing Earth (and I repeat my "Not happening" phrase).

                @Amelyssan<br> Well-said my friend. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"><br> <br> Breakout clones <span class="tid_underline">should</span> follow those ball-steering rules in order to guarantee good success. Sure it's not 100% precise and doesn't always work like it should in some titles, mainly of arcade ones, such as <em>Goindol</em>, and <em>Thunder and Lightning</em>, but at least you can change the ball's angle and direction. <em>AlphaBounce</em> (this game) and <em>Ricochet</em> are by far the only two Breakout clones I'm very familiar with that have flawless ball controlling physics, which you need to master later in the game in order to avoid the death blocks. The biggest offender to this law, however, is <em>Aquanoid</em>, which doesn't allow you to steer the ball with the paddle or change it's angle, the only tool you're given is a "tilt" to change the ball's direction incase it ends up in a loop.

                Alright, I got my third supporting drone, so hopefully that should be enough to challenge Balixt's evil reducines. Though I should point out I'm not heading there just yet; I want to do some cleanup missions and gather up more <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_mineral.gif" alt=":mineral:"> before I do such, so I can have a bit of an easier time doing some of the levels far beyond the origin point.<br> <br> It's pretty sad that Karbonis imploded early in AlphaBounce's lifetime; I would've liked to see what it's levels and colors would look like. Though it's no worry that I can't get any % for Karbonis, I just wish I was one of AlphaBounce's first players and had kept screencaps of Karbonis' levels. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(">

                Well I'm more used to starting a level with three lives, but thank god that I don't require any more life sacrificing from here on out.<br> <br> To tell you the truth, I usually survive a perfect run in a few of the levels, but for most of them, I end up consuming up some, if not all of my lives trying to pass a level. While I know a lot about these kind of games, I'm not a skilled player at them, just a casual one.<br> <br> For me, the main difficulty comes from the ball's never-ending increase in speed. Normally in most breakout games, the ball maintains one single speed, and only bumps up a speed level as the level goes on. Of course there are the speedup/down powerup/downs, like [X] and [Z], but the X powerup only does it's thing for a few moments, and I normally go for the speedup powerdown in most Breakout games, but avoid it here as it makes the ball incredibly faster than I can keep up with, and also since I know it increases in speed either way. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_cross.gif" alt=":croix:"><br> <br> As before, I'm not saying that the challenge in this aspect is a bad thing, I'm just stating my opinions. I know the game will get trickier, and I will need to get equipped with the proper items to survive the harder levels.<br> <br> After I'm finished with Balixt, I'll go do some more cleanup missions so I can cross the Karbonis Belt with no problem, get the seven stars, return Salmeen to his planet, get the remaining two Antimatter pieces and get my missile upgraded, and then venture out and improve the designs on some of the random-built levels.<br> <br> Yea, big agenda. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_question.gif" alt=":quoi:">

                Well I would like to complete Balixt first since I'm already on the planet with 55% of it completed. Though I'm not attempting to land on the planets because A) I don't have strong enough landing equipment and B) I get irritated about uncollected <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_mineral.gif" alt=":mineral:">'s disintegrating if you fail to land, with no explanation as to why. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?"><br> <br> I know you said to discard the message over what side I'm going with, but just for the sake of letting out my imagination, the ESCorp seems like the one with the better upgrades that makes it easier to pass the levels, especially with the longer paddle and stronger missiles. The FURI seems to have some good items in store as well, but they won't help me as much as the ESCorp's upgrades. They'd be cool to own however.<br> <br> If for whatever reason anyone here would like to hear my concepts about AlphaBounce's never-to-come boss fights, alternative endings, getting items from the opposing squad, "reviving" Karbonis, and the advanced master level editor, please don't hesitate to ask.

                Apologies for the double post, but I ripped a grey block from the game and colorized it into thousands of other colors based on ones from Photoshop's many, many palettes. I assume blocks can be one of 18.6 million different colors, with how many hues I've seen in the space levels.<br> You can see it below. Because it's a huge file, you should download it to see it in it's original hi-res form. <br> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediafire.com/i/?224snpf6qy85xvw">www.mediafire.com/i/?224snpf6q ...</a><br> <br> Once I unlock the editor after doing the cleanups and missions, I'll try to find some parasite blocks and colorize those, as they to can exist in many colors.
