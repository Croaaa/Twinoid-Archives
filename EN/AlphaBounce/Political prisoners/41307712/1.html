                <p>Somebody with money please buy Alphabounce from MT and I will find someone to update it and keep it going... if this game gets updated and gets good advertisement it will win so much money... I havent played since 2 years maybe but I dont have any desire to play when I know everything is left to rot like that..... MT must be really dumb to leave hammerfest and alphabounce in the dust like that.... There is no logical reason in all of this - If people pay ( a lot of people pay knowing that there will be no update ) you must keep the game up thats how you win money... Im gonna write to MT and ask them if they will sell the game and for how much cuz this is a gold mine and they are throwing it away... Hammerfest is the same thing - I am the kinda guy that usually doesnt pay for games but I have payed some cash for these games and I keep checking for updates every once in a while... this is something I would never do for any other game so far... And I still see people who give so much money for both games... Its pathetic how we pay for this game but MT uses the money to make other, mostly stupid games in my opinion, and just ignore 2 of their best games... Also they keep ignoring all their customers who write to them about the particular games... I have played Alphbounce actively for more than 4 years and since im here nothing has been done in both games there is no other game that I have played so much and that includes NON-browser games too... they get updated every year and I still get bored with them and alphabounce isnt getting updated at all but I am still interested in it ... Its so frustrating sorry for the long post but I just hate when something like that happens + I love both games and I cant understand this...</p>

Don't buy the game itself, as the cost to rip it out of the Twinoid system and make it completely stand-alone will be expensive and you'll probably get a negative ROI on that. Sure, you'd then have a copy of the codebase and user data that's under your complete control but you might lose most of the current audience as they probably enjoy the perks that Twinoid affords as a network of games</p><p>If you could buy the IP off of them, the agreement should be to put an ad for your version (which I assume would be "Alphabounce 2"<strong></strong>) on this existing game in exchange for a license to use the Alphabounce name on MT's existing products. You can then use your connections to make the new game and do what you want with it</p><br><p>Or to put it a different way: I doubt MT is selling, and you really should just try to make your own game if you truly think it's lucrative to do so. A new game would do much better than a refresh of an old one, and you don't <em>need</em> the Alphabounce name (in my opinion). And if you need the existing code as a launching point, then you need to find better coding friends to help you out</p>
