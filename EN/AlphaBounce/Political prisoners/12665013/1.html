                Friday, March 13th,<br> <br> I was arrested for something I now dont want remember, Placed in an over crowded prison with twenty back to back live sentences for one small computer virus...  <br> <br> Well the Virus was unique so to say, it was designed to be passed by atm cards, stick an infected card in an atm machine effect the machine, swipe an infected card in a credit slot boom the terminal was infected. It was a glorious virus in that aspect. The AI of the virus was designed to hide and spread until the turn of the year or it had infected the entire planet which ever had came first.<br> <br> I was not expecting the virus to infect the planet in three weeks.  <br> <br> Its payload was to disrupt the entire banking system of Mars.  It never was to touch Terre, but it did. Oh lord it did.  I was found a week after Mars collapsed under the decimated monetary system. Because of the one bank that went down on earth. <br> <br> Terre Authorities were able to trace and locate my tags in the programing which lead to my Arrest.  I will say the trial was almost a sham, not even my lawyer tried to defend me he sold me up river because his brother was an owner of one the Mars banks.<br> <br> I spent the first part of my term on the over crowded IO prison Moon, When ESCorp was looking for ahem gunny pigs to try their mining platforms for Rehab of Criminal Offenders.  I turned down the offer multiple times.  <br> <br> My Two cell mates Khelben and Bloodtears took the chance at their first opportunity. I while stationed at the IO prison Moon waited, ESCorp had made some of the logs from the miners available. Two days ago I had seen an entry that Khelben had posted, apparently he has found a way to get away.   Now I think I may see a glimmer of hope here.  If he was able to find information on how to get away from the system then I may find a way to return to Terre and Extract my revenge on the Banks and the Courts.

                Oh lord I just saw your envelope blow by me, now dont you and Khelben get into that shared brain cell of yours to go and try to go fugitive on this, They are giving us a chance to earn our freedom here.<br> <br> And Terre why oh why would you want to get back to that stinking planet that put you in IO to begin with?<br> <br> I take it since you still know your crime then you some how circumvented the required Memory alteration back on IO. <br> <br> How did you do it my first memories was being put in the same cell as you and Khel?<br> <br> But look at it this way Khelben came out here first I think he was looking for escape me I came out here looking for redemption and hopefully finding some peace, and then you all you want is to go back to that over populated rat hole of a planet.  <br> <br> It is not like you buried a couple billion Zenbucks somewhere over there now is it?<br> <br> We got a sweet gig here guys these envelopes provide air and food, the com channels provide company. and were not crowded into a 5 ft by 5 ft cell. Dont blow it.<br> <br> Mind being locked to these envelopes with an electronic leash is not all that fun but then we can still land and get out when we want.  <br> <br> Just don't do anything dumb ok, serve your sentence and then go back to terre and don't repeat your last mistake ok.<br> <br> Me I may see if they will let me keep mining when my service is up.<br> <br> Tears

                The Mind Wiper probably isn't used all the time. It would seem, as proven by the new prisoner that has joined us, to be quite problematic; I know that when I had to go through it, it didn't work but still said it did; obviously, I didn't speak up. Suckers.<br> But I would guess that after all this time they'll have realized it and put it on experimental status and use it on new prisoners to experiment to see if it works or not; of course the ESCorp won't wait for it to actually start working to harvest working hands...<br> <br> As for the Earth itself; who cares anymore? Even if you complete your term, people will never just accept you back into society. The only reason I can see for someone to want to return to the Earth would be to show to himself and others that he is capable of the feat. I'd probably just go there, take a peek out the envelope, show my tongue to them, probably while landing on their expensive cars, and then leave, and go back to space. Oh, I'm gonna love hearing about the car owners sueing ESCorp for allowing a prisoner to go that far.<br> <br> In any case, completing your term? Yeah, no, I'm not going to respect the desires of a faceless corporation who abuses prisoners so they can do <strong>their</strong> job for little to no reward. Yeah, we may have been prisoners at one point, but we are not slaves. Capitalism spreading so far away from home is only proof that the whole galaxy will go downhill from here.<br> <br> Not to mention that completing your term would do nothing, they'd probably find an excuse to keep you as their prisoner for as long as they can. Remember Douglas. Remember Balixt. Never forget.<br> <br> So yeah, it's been quite a long time since I've turned my back on them and started working against them. This group of environmentalists may have concerns serious concerns about the damage that ESCorp's cause, and I sympathize, but I have my own reasons for joining them.<br> <br> But perhaps, I'd like to return to the Earth at some point, and stay for some time. Clear the planet's upper atmosphere, you know? I'm sure it's cluttered with satellites, and I'm also pretty certain that many of their parts are probably made of pretty expensive equipment... But yeah, I'd love to stick around for a bit. It's been too long since I last had contact with other intelligent beings... Last one was probably that crazy mechanic that upgraded my envelope's radar. It is lonely here in space, and most of the time that I go around liberating prisoners from ESCorp's iron fist, we barelly have the time to share more than a word.

                ::fumbles with the old radio logs and runs into Vasq retelling the time on IO Prison.::<br> <br> Ye had to mention that rat hole?  Well aside from Bloody the mind wiper does not seem to work on those who do not give into it, you can resist it.  Vasq I will say for such a smart programmer you never figured that one out?<br> <br> Ok since the other guys have bore their souls I will also. I am no stranger to the Mining envelope technology.  I was at one time a member of a Geological exploratory mission trying to find new worlds for Us humans to move on to.  The Ship we were assigned on while in deep space was attacked by an Alien life force, Having no real weapons other then the Old style Ping Pong miner systems, otherwise Known as Vehicular Assisted Utility System or the VAUS for short. We had defeated the Life force at least three different times on our journey back to earth.  But we had not realized it had not died only hidden and followed us.<br> <br> During our journey back we had found alien tech that had upgraded our Vaus Systems but only one at a time.  In the time between our return and the day the life force had found its way to earth we had sold the tech to some of the Mining companies for them to reverse engineer.  <br> <br> The day the life force had attacked no on on earth had known about it.  The life force had built a massive wall around the system to start consuming the life trapped with in its walls.  <br> <br> The mining companies who were out testing the Reverse Engineered capsules were the ones to discover the wall and destroy it.  Those mining companies merged into ESCorp... The newly formed ESCorp had informed the government of what it had just defeated... This cause the whole Crew of the ship I was on to be Quarantined and arrested for bringing an interstellar monster to Earth.  <br> <br> What is now know as the Envelopes is the Reverse Engineered VAUS system.   The ESCorp had found the new systems doubled its profit tenfold and soon had grown big enough to that the areas to mine were more then the trained crew they had.  <br> <br> During the Battle with the life Force the ESCorp had reverse Engineered one piece of tech from the remains of that life force, the Indirection Engine., an Engine so powerful it was able to Randomly Move a solar system and planets around.  They traded that tech to the Earth Government for the protection of the Planet in exchange for the use of its Prison Population to Keep its mining profits up. <br> <br> The Earth now Randomly moves around the Galaxy due to this deal but always in a predefined Interstellar Direction or a P.I.D. mapping.  ESCorp being the ones who gave Earth that tech always know where it is to Acquire more Prisoners but those of us who are in the Envelopes there are only rumors on how to get there.<br> <br> All of this History happened while I was Imprisoned in the IO correctional Facility where Eventually I was joined by Vasq and Bloodtears.  <br> <br> Knowing the basic prehistory of ESCorp and how to handle a Primitive Envelope I personally jumped at the opportunity to get back out in space. <br> <br> Now this is where people are going to be scratching their heads after all this question is asked over and over "ESCorp has been in business for a couple hundred years at this point, how could you have been a miner in those Ancient times...?"<br> <br> I/O prison is very unique in its treatment of prisoners, If you are to say suppose to serve 25 consecutive life sentences for nearly bringing Ruination to Life as we know it when you get old they have found ways to Rejuvenate your body via Nanite technology injected into the blood stream to the Approx age of 18 so you can serve the next sentence.  I was on my sixth Rejuvenation cycle when my Cell block  was offered the chance at the ESCorp miner Release Program.  So I dont fear growing old any more the Nanites are programed to Restore me nineteen more times, to ensure I serve my full Sentence.<br> <br> Hence why I want to Escape ESCorp and hit the wild Edges of space, maybe if I am lucky I can find a way of Ridding my body of the Nanites and finally getting the Peace I want... <br> <br> Unlike Blood Tears who has only to serve his sentance all the way out and earn redemption, Or vasq who wants revenge against Earth. I just want to be able to die a normal death... the peace that Douglas has now gotten is something that will be denied me, so I count him as Lucky and use his Envelope in memory of his release.  <br> <br> There you go the Full story now anyone got a way of Debugging this Cruddy Windows version they put in these blasted envelopes or maybe a Hyperlinux shell so I can reprogram the blasted thing. <br> <br> Khelben<br> Former I/O prisoner

                So that is what had caused the Hibernation mode to go off, Did I not teach you anything while in that Cell at the IO prison they Tie the cell mates together with Transceivers to prevent them from harming each other and making escape impossible.  Your linked to both me and Bloodtears if one of us gets shut down we all three get shut down, the capsil will release a neurotoxin into our blood streams to put us to sleep.  That was part of the expermental contract we had signed to get this gig, IO prison gets to monitor our progress and actions for one year until ESCorp gets the final keys to our transivers.  <br> <br> Wait you said more then a year went by?  Are you sure your Chronometer is reading right?<br> <br> Well then that means our Test contract is over, the one Year that IO prison can pull us back is over... The dead man button can not be pressed again, IO prison would never release that Tech out of its control.  Double more so if they are feeding whole Cell blocks into ESCorp.  <br> <br> So the hard wire timer on our capsules now should be burnt out due to the Contract.  Well it looks like you get to try and find that overcrowded stinking little planet of yours after all.  IO prison can no longer effect you directly.<br> <br> Khelben Former IO Prisoner <br> Zeta Omega block - cell 155 prisoner a <br> <br> P.S. Hey Bloodtears you have any down time also?<br> <br> P.P.S. YF23 are you also from the IO prison test program or are you from another ESCorp prison Population?
