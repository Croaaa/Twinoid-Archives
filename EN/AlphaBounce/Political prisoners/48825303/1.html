                <p>Most of us still in the forums know our FURIs and ESCorps. We know the factions, and understand their differences. Both of them receive different upgrades as they progress through the game. I think these upgrades can be described in categories, and can be directly compared to each other. I'll try to get into it, under my own impressions.</p><br><br><p>Each faction, once all upgrades have been maxed, will include:</p><br><br><br><p><strong>1. One mechanism that allows for quicker movement.</strong><br><cite><em>ESCorp</em> Lithium Retrofusor <em>|<img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/icons/small_forum_read.gif" alt=":ab_planets_1:" class="tid_ico">|</em> Syntrogenic Accelerator <em>FURI</em></cite><cite>The Lithium Retrofusor allows the user to return to the origin at any time, completely for free. The Syntrogenic Accelerator gives a free new <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel_free.gif" alt=":ab_fg:" class="tid_ico"> per day. Both allow for quicker and more convenient travel around the system during average gameplay, but feel very, very different on actual usage. The ESCorp's is active, while the FURI's is passive. While a FURI will always play a little more, to get wherever he wants quicker in real-life time, an ESCorp will be able to instantly skip huge portions of travel when travelling across the system is necessary.<br><br>Both are incredibly useful for similar but different reasons. In the end, though, the main difference will be that the FURI allows for more playtime for the player, while the ESCorp is objectively more convenient in terms of travelling efficiency, all other factors ignored. And when one has mineral routes available that will give endless <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel.gif" alt=":ab_fr:" class="tid_ico"> if one desires, the extra <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel_free.gif" alt=":ab_fg:" class="tid_ico"> becomes much less significant.<br>When placed next to each other, I think both commodities are about equal during normal gameplay, more so when taking into account that every ESCorp cleaning mission is much much longer than a single-sector FURI liberation. In the postgame, though, with endless <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel.gif" alt=":ab_fr:" class="tid_ico">,nothing compares to the Retrofusor.</cite></p><br><br><p><strong>2. A specific paddle size.</strong><br><cite><em>ESCorp</em> 99 pixels <em>|<img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/favicon.ico" alt=":ab:" class="tid_ico">|</em> 63 pixels <em>FURI</em></cite><cite>A paddle 50% bigger is definitely an objective advantage. It will easily cover most mistakes done by tricky mouse movements, as well as provide greater ease to maintain one and multiple fast balls. However, this advantage is not active one hundred percent of the time: FURI's smaller paddle will allow them to evade attacks much easier, as well as choose which bonuses to take or not take. Evading a W or I, or a falling space nut, can sometimes be much more important than being able to maintain a fast ball. The ESCorp will be on the smooth edge on most situations, though, and for so they win a point. <br><br>People argue that a paddle so big isn't necessary, and that one accommodates and gets used to having whatever size one has: I have experienced this myself. Moreover, E bonuses will also be of much more help and luxury for FURI members, and those are the absolute most common bonuses in the game. For that reason, I won't believe that the ESCorp is winning the advantage race just yet.<br><br>As a postscript, I will add that in nightmare mode, the bigger paddle is truly a life-saver.</cite></p><br><br><p><strong>3. A tool that aids in level gameplay.</strong><br><cite><em>ESCorp</em> FORA 7R-Z mines <em>|<img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/icons/small_bricks.gif" alt=":ab_mission_10:" class="tid_ico">|</em> Saumir's Twinner <em>FURI</em></cite><cite>The mines are randomly placed all over the level, and provide an explosion upon hit by the ball, destroying nearby bricks. Saumir's Twinner will make the player start each new life, including the first one, with two balls instead of one. Now, there are some serious problems with both of these tools. The mines have to be bought, up to a maximum of four, and they cost tens of thousands of minerals. Additionally, one has no control over where they will be placed on the level, and so they won't reach their maximum potential on an important part of cases. And the FURI's additional ball, or twin ball, requires extra dexterity to keep for more than a few seconds, and while it will be useful, one of the balls will be lost very early on most lives. The focus required to maintain both balls might even prejudice the player, distracting him from the playing field itself.<br><br>The ESCorp mines, though, might provide great help in their passive stay, possibly destroying several annoying conglomerates that will be surrounding them from time to time. And money isn't a drawback in the endgame, where there aren't any good items to buy, apart from <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel.gif" alt=":ab_fr:" class="tid_ico">. The twin balls not only render death bricks almost useless and clean levels a little faster, but they beautifully complement the last FURI item, without which, the twinner wouldn't make much sense.</cite></p><br><br><p><strong>4. An ultimate upgrade.</strong><br><cite><em>ESCorp</em> AR-SRX missile <em>|<img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_mineral.gif" alt=":ab_m:" class="tid_ico">|</em> Asphalt-Project ball <em>FURI</em></cite><cite>The enlarged 5x5 explosion of the incredibly powerful AR-SRX can clean the very most dangerous levels in seconds, if the situation, albeit rare, calls for it. These missiles, even if ammo availability is not at its best, can easily get rid of important threats instantly and make space for the ball to do its job. The Asphalt-project, in contrast, is an always-active, permanent beast: The ball will not stop upon hitting a brick, but will destroy up to three more before bouncing back. Accompained by Saumir's Twinner, and a native breaking power even greater than that of the OX-Delta, the secret prototype mission converts the drilling ball from a tool to a weapon, able to clean levels without drawbacks. On itself, it gives huge competition to both of ESCorp's final mining tools.<br><br>These two final items enhance, or aid to define, the gameplay role of users of both factions. The loyal ESCorp prisoner will be the best in mining, being sent whenever the company needs him to in the blink of an eye, and cleaning levels efficiently, easily destroying threats, and maneuvering the envelope stably. The FURI member will be free, powerful and radical, cleaning levels under the careful but zeal control of the paddle's movements, that direct the sheer power of two balls' demolishing auras.<br></cite></p><br><br><br><br><p>It is clear that there is no objective choice. Members of both factions have completely different gimmicks and gameplay, and might enjoy the experience for different reasons. Both options are amazing. The ESCorp does get more benefits on first glance, but arguments can be made that put both factions on the same level.<br>I chose to join the FURI, because of the sense of freedom and the need to stay on the move. I couldn't stand the cleaning missions, and staying so long in the same small spot with little reward. Enjoying my extra fuel will feel great as well.</p><p>I hope you choose your career well.</p>

                <p>Nice write up.</p><p>There is no doubt the FURI ball is more reliable and efficient at clearing levels than ESCorp's missiles and mines combined, because let's be honest, how many missiles can we afford to waste? Sure 5 missiles can clear 50% of an average level and that's acceptable when you're surrounded by merchants, but on distant levels you don't have that luxury, and the missile regenerator that is available to both factions, can only help so much. So on difficult levels, and with no merchants nearby, you have 1 missile that you can use for free since the missile regenerator will reload 1 missile at a time, and if you don't want to shoot yourself in the foot, you have to look after your reserves. As for the mines, as you said they are randomly placed, so they can be helpful when placed next to a death brick but many times they're not. On the other hand, the FURI ball (single or twin) is there all the time, every time.</p><p>I agree you get used to your paddle size, but I don't remember how it was before my upgrade. What I can tell you for a fact is that I would require a significant amount of time to get used to FURI's smaller paddle, but I'm pretty sure FURI players have no problem whatsoever.</p><p>Now in terms of moving around, the reason I don't find the extra <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel_free.gif" alt=":ab_fg:" class="tid_ico"> so attractive is that I've been using the <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_mineral.gif" alt=":ab_m:" class="tid_ico"> routes for thousands of sectors, making hundreds of <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel.gif" alt=":ab_fr:" class="tid_ico"> for free. I don't mean to say the extra <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel_free.gif" alt=":ab_fg:" class="tid_ico"> isn't a sweet addition, but it's not something I couldn't live without. On the other hand, ESCorp's retrofusor is so versatile and efficient. It pretty much bends the world. It brings missions closer, maximizes <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_mineral.gif" alt=":ab_m:" class="tid_ico">, saves <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel.gif" alt=":ab_fr:" class="tid_ico"> and it's there all the time, every time.</p><p>That said, if I ever decided to start over, I would go with FURI, just for a different experience.</p>

                <p>Agree that this is a nice write-up. A minor correction, though: the asphalt ball will clear up to four more bricks, not just three (it hits five times in immediate succession before bouncing).</p><p>Regarding paddle size, you definitely adjust. It takes a bit of time--the first few weeks after leaving ESCorp I died, a lot. But once you make the adjustment, bigger paddles (via E powerups) become a luxury: nice if you can get them, but not really necessary. And there have been times when I have deliberately avoided E powerups because the level had a lot of kashuat bricks or guardians, etc, and it's far easier to dodge with a smaller paddle.</p>

It's was almost an even split.</cite><p>Really? That's a wonderful result.</p><p>I do see a bigger amount of loyal ESCorp prisoners near the very top. If I had to theorize, I'd say that one possible cause for this occurrence would be that, one needs to be an innately perseverant and patient individual to complete ESCorp cleaning missions all the way to 52 and then 100. Thus, some of the most perseverant players in the game ended up more easily going far into that faction, and have continued to play for years until reaching the very top.</p><p>But that's just rambling from my part. I'd like to count myself, now that the years have passed.</p>
