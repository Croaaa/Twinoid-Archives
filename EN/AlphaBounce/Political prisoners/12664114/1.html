                A scientific study done en route to various locations by Prisoner VitaTimC. Observations will be added once met; many kinds of matter have been observed, but only just now have they been actively recorded and described.<br> <br> Above the planet termed Lycans, there exists a certain type of explosive conglomerate. The appearance of the block is light orange in color. I have determined this bricks to actually be hollow shells filled with pressurized ammonium picrate gas (NH4C6H3O7), which explodes naturally at high temperatures or pressures. Even though the large pyrotechnical display caused by this conglomerate seems dangerous, most standard drilling balls are resilient enough to resist the explosion. Thus, miners are encouraged to target these often helpful bricks, which can be utilized to destroy solid iron bricks also commonly found in the area.

                Also, on the nearby planet called Soupaline there is reappearing bricks, purple in color. This effect is caused by consisting of microorganisms in bricks that after disturbance always returning to it's place. They have so large move-ability that they returning even from Quasars, more known as Black Holes! Their colour came from the chrom oxid, much of which consisted in their shells. It's so many of them on Soupaline because the best atmosphere for them is the ozon layer, which is present at Soupaline in mush tighter form than on Earth. The only way to absolutely break them is to use space cracks, more known as Openings, to break the place of their colony, so they can't find their compagnons. All of this organisms are very outside-effects-immune, so only exclusuvely low temperatures (about -10000 C) can kill them, which causes in all universe only by effect called Glace. Their size in only about 0,001 nanometers, so they are smaller than some molecules. Their unique ability is creating O2 from the compound of Ferum, Copper or Nickel.

                Also, on the distance from both Soupaline and Lycans there is large planet named Cilorile. It is reverse-Earth, may to say. Water there is toxic, on land no plants are growing, from the air there is only O2, so you still can breath there freely. Largest problem for miners on this planet are carnivore plants that can fly by some strange way. Oxygen replaces all necessary means of being for them - water, air, ground... The only thing that leaves beyound its reach is food. Strange Cilorile's fauna is suffer throughout the planet from this plants, which has been called by scientists "Guardians", and by uneducated miners "Gardiens". Also they never refusing from miners as food. These plants are sleeping most of the time, but when they awoking bu ball's hit, they immediatly springing to <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_pad.gif" alt=":pad:">. Fortunately, <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_pad.gif" alt=":pad:">s are safe from their jaws, and Guardians are often crushing upon the rocky surface of planet. But still, when they got hold of <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_pad.gif" alt=":pad:">, they are bringing it beyond themself upon rocks. And good news - on walking on planet's surface, miners are safe from these plants, because they awoking by themselves only only one time time in about 100 years.<br> <br> Faithfully yours, Candidate of Chemical Scienses Dariush <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"><br> <br> P.S.: Sorry for my English <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":innocent:">

Because the vehicles and tanks holding these are essentially containers, they are named respectively "envelope" and "capsule".<br> <br> While the acceleration of drilling balls is an unsolved problem, the over-unity behavior proved an invaluable source of unlimited energy.<br> This made possible the use of matter synthesizers which now equip all standard envelopes, and popularized the use of the most abundant matter available as space fuel: Hydrogen.<br> <br> <br> The <strong>momentum storage</strong>, more commonly know as <strong>range bungee</strong>, was a later development that significantly improved space mining.<br> <br> It's purpose is to evade an object's momentum to and recover it from the universe's reverse side.<br> <br> This allows excellent maneuvering: instead of expensive and slow braking and propelling, the device simply stores or restitutes directly speed in the direction needed.<br> However it has severe limitations:<br> -It has short range, in other words it allows to maneuver only close to the point where the device was activated. For that reason it could not be used on drilling balls and instead equips envelopes.<br> -It operates only along the object's greatest dimension. So because envelopes need a flat top for drilling ball bounces, they can move only left-right.<br> <br> The practical result is that envelopes operate in a small zone, and for convenience space was divided in a grid of such size.

                I am afraid that scientist Dariush is quite mistaken in some of his observations. The ESCorp scientists, which have both better equipment and more well-paid researchers have determined that the purple conglomerates that appear above Soupaline to be composed of nitrogen, as detailed in the mission report pertaining to the planet. My observations have led me to discover that there is probably another, unreactive gas mixed with nitrogen, most probably radon, due to it's large mass. The large mass of the radon and it's relative stability causes the nitrogen (N2) molecules to reform gaseous clouds seconds after being dispersed due to London Dispersion Forces. For an unknown reason, these clouds are dense enough to cause an action-reaction effect when the ball passes through them, causing the ball to reflect.<br> <br> Also in Lycans, there is an overabundance of the chemical known as 'Lycans Rock,' one of the major component of missiles. Many envelopes have been equipped with sensors to detect these useful blocks which, when mined, release raw materials ready for synthesis into missiles.

                I really think that I was right. Only few weeks ago scientists proved that these bricks are organic. I won't rewrite their approvation of it because it was publicaly released throughout the universe. Also, how will you explain the transformation of different metals into O2?

                Also, lots of conlogremates, (Confirmation?) on Tiboon and Lycans have the strange ability that when you go above them, the O2 in them turns back into strong material, as if it absorbs the balls energy when it passes. It remains like that until the drilling ball goes under the conlogremate, then the O2 somehow loses the stored energy (Basically, stops absorbing), and can be broken again. Again, just like their brothers, the purple regenerating blocks, they are taken out by extremely cold temperatures (Mainly -270 Celcius), then the O2 freezes and then shatters for good. Also, weird space cracks often break them apart. However, if they get sucked in to miniature black holes (Quazars), the structure sees that, and the O2 can still absorb the balls energy.

                Many miners have wondered to the origin of deadly black conglomerates scattered throughout the universe. In truth, little is known about these strange objects. It appears to be an ordinary conglomerate that has decayed, its interior forming into a powerful Blackmatter vortex. Ordinarily, in the vacuum of space, Blackmatter disperses before it's able to cause any extensive damage. However, if a drilling ball smashes into one of these mysterious blocks, the vortex engulfs and destroys the ball before completely dispersing, resulting in the prisoner who released the ball losing one of their extra envelopes if they haven't released any additional balls. Additionally, if a ball charged with a "Volt" powerup approaches one of these blocks, the electricity arcs and draws the Darkmatter from the inside straight to the ball, which also has fatal results. In an effort to protect inexperienced miners, ESCorp has programmed all envelopes to project a small white skull onto these blocks, warning all to avoid at all costs.

                Scientist Dariush, I am afraid that the sources that state that the purple conglomerates are organic are untrustworthy and ultimately spurious. Here, I quote the ESCorp: "Because the atmosphere is highly saturated with nitrogen purple conglomerates appear. They can re-synthesize a few seconds after being drilled."<br> <br> Also, no oxygen is present in the upper levels of the atmosphere; at least, not enough to significantly affect mining. Besides, I highly doubt that microorganisms can convert iron, etc. to oxygen, which would require a massive nuclear reaction of non-radioactive elements.<br> <br> Another report: All miners know of the green, blue, and pink minerals found in the upper layers of planets and in deep space. These crystals are formed when a seed molecule comes in contact with crystal dust. Over time, the dust gathers around the seed and forms a crystal block. Because there is no pressure in space, this crystal is held together very loosely, and one hit with a drilling ball can shatter it into smaller gems ready for collection. Occasionally, when close to the surface of a planet, gravity may induce these crystals to group together, creating crystal "fields." Sometimes, these fall to the planet surface as magnificent crystal specimens.

                Although it is commonly seen by all miners, no one knows why the drilling ball is attracted to the paddle after moving a certain distance away from the envelope. This might be worth looking into - it's been taken for granted by everyone. Of course, the answer may be as simple as gravity...<br> <br> Also, many miners take capsules for granted. It's already well known how they work, but because the sensors of the envelope detect these materials and digitally put images of 'capsules' around them, new miners might be baffled by colorful "pills" dropping from  mined conglomerates. For the sake of completion, I will explain this.<br> <br> Capsules are actually various materials that have different effects on balls. The twenty-five minerals with the most drastic effects on the ball or paddle have been painstakingly documented, and the envelope now scans them and projects the image of a capsule. One common example is magnetic iron dust - some bricks are actually composed of a brick of magnetized dust. When broken, the particles move towards the nearest magnetized object - in this case, the envelope. They attach to the ends of the paddle, which are charged with a strong electric force for easy movement. This force also holds the iron in place, effectively 'elongating' the envelope. This dust is marked [E] by the ESCorp.

                Theory:<br> <br> Warning: This is an untested suggestion.<br> <br> Karbonis' explosion is a mystery far beyond our regular type, but there is one theory I would like to bring forward.<br> <br> Karbonis had a highly unstable core, a condition then worsened by the effects of drilling using such 'powerups' as flame and volt. A passing asteroid field then bombarded Karbonis, whose weakened atmosphere could not eradicate the incoming debris. The impact and added mass of these asteroids, at least one of which possibly landed near the core (due to exposed sections of the planet stripped of its minerals)<br> <br> This impact was great enough to activate nuclear fusion in the core. The energy released by this reaction then started a chain reaction of nuclear fissions, whose combined energy, along with unstable conglomerates as seen on Lycans and a highly unstable planetary structure matrix was enough of an explosive force to then scatter Karbonis into a ring of rocks and asteroids now known as the Karbonis belt.

                Data recently brought to the attention of the theorist now demands this ammendment to the previous theory:<br> <br> The asteroid strike is what probably caused the mining facility to explode, destabilizing the core. Karbonis then began collapsing upon itself, and simply would have been a black hole. However it's unstable conglomerates with effects magnified by drilling activities then allowed nuclear fusion, whose energy triggered nuclear fission, which blew the planet across the universe.

                I wouldn't think Nuclear Fusion would have been possible on Karbonis. Nuclear fusion requires temperatures of about 10^8 degrees Celcious/Kelvin, and a simply asteroid storm wouldn't have created temperatures anywhere near that. Instead, I think that it is more likely that Karbonis' implosion is a result of purely nuclear fission reactions.<br> <br> As such it is likely that Karbonis was a planet on which either military tests were taking place, or the ESCorp was developing prototypes of new ball or missile models. In fact, since we know for a fact that the ESCorp has developped Anti-matter technology, we can safelly rule even Nuclear Fission. It is possible that matter-antimatter reactions went rapidly out of hand, causing the internal structure of the planet to collapse, and the energy released was enough to cause the outer structure to break apart, and the subsequent forces caused the remaining parts to fly off to a large distance before stopping by the gravitational forces of the planets close to the origin, thus forming the Karbonis Belt.<br> <br> Allow me go a bit deeper on the Anti-matter hypothesis.<br> We know that only a few antimatter nuclei in a missile each can create high enough energies to break apart up to 9 conglomerates. Also, thanks to te Theory of Relativity (E = mc^2) we can plainly see that with only little amounts or matter and antimatter very high energies can be produced. The sudden and out of control reaction that caused Karbonis to become unstable could have easily been one such reaction:<br> <br> The ESCorp could have been trying to fit more antimatter nuclei in missiles to achieve the explosive power the Pnk Crystals the ARS-X uses without the Crystals, either because of their rarity or because they weren't discovered yet at that point in time. Due to human error, more antimatter than expected could have gone into the experimental missiles, and the subsequent explosion could have destroyed the lab; the storing space for anti-matter (the same type of storage area as used with the MAS-Z, but in a far larger scale, I assume) could have been damaged, allowing for large quantities of stored antimatter to leak out and react with the matter normally found in the surrounding environment. Eventually Karbonis' structure couldn't handle the large explosion in it's depths and forcefully broke apart.<br> <br> Thoughts and comments are welcome.

                ...the ESCorp wouldn't have done that. They might be power hungry and greedy, but destroying a planet for the sake of puttng more restriction on people already under their control? A planet with civilization, nonetheless. No, it's going way too far. You don't just blow a planet up like that.

                Message from Anthony Lazenby<br> -Investigator 236 of USEC<br> <br> AS FOLLOWS:<br> <br> [Well, while the Karbonis Incident was certainly an unprecedented one for this sector, from data aquired from extra-sectorial sources; we can see that similar results were observed during the containment breach disaster on Juliot, a small heavily-mined planet in the Hern sector.<br> This disaster's cause was pinpointed to a failure in the magnetic field surrounding their antimatter reactor core in the deepest section of the mines. The resulting reaction, of approximatley 0.85 tonnes of antimatter/matter explosion, was powerful enough to physically shatter the planet beyond it's gravitational forces. <br> These rare disasters are extremely unfortunate, and indeed highlight the need for a more wary antimatter use watchdog, to hopefully prevent any more of these events. Certainly it was only the work of ESCorp's speedy emplacement of magnetic shielding around all our sector's planets and installations which prevented further loss of life due to radiation bathing from the explosions source, but it seems odd that they had the forewarning to do so, when noone else seemed to predict what would happen on that fateful day..<br> <br> MESSAGE ENDS<br> <br> NOTE: <span class="tid_underline">NOT</span> Appr111011011<br> - ERROR!
