                AlphaBounce - L'espace fini<br> <br> Written by Lavos<br> <br> Note: this will definetly deviate quite far from the AB storyline, but beware of spoilers anyway <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"><br> <br> <br> ==introduction==<br> <br> 	Joseph sat rotting in his prison cell. Well, to be fair, he wasn't really rotting, but he sure looked the part. Joseph was the kind who wouldn't let his mind decay in even the most mentally intensive situations. But even for him, the long wait was taxing. Three years ago to the second, he was imprisoned after being found guilty for twelve different murders over a span of seven months - the police described him as 'slippery' though it was as great an understatement as any.<br> <br> 	Three years. Of course, his sentence was much more punishing than such a minuscule amount of time. Three years was rather the mandatory waiting period before a prisoner was granted the option to apply for more intense and dangerous jobs to shorten his sentence.<br> <br> 	Joseph wasn't about to wait any longer.<br> <br> 	An orange button lit up next to the tiny monitor embedded in the stone-gray walls of his cell. Joseph lightly tapped the button. The screen lit up, lighting Joseph's weary, unshaven face as well as the cell's only other features, a toilet and a small, uncomfortable 'bed'.<br> <br> 	Through a horrible, static-ridden signal, an automated voice sounded. "<em>bzzt</em>..lo, pris... <em>brzzzt</em> ...er. Please... <em>brzzzzzt</em> ...reason for this call."<br> <br> 	Joseph's voice replied to the fake-sounding female voice emitted from the outdated speaker. His voice was rough, as he fumbled for the right words. He hadn't spoken in three years.<br> <br> 	"I wish to... apply now, for... the ESCorp."<br> <br> 	Another woman, one that actually exists, spoke this time. "...Thank you for your... <em>bzzzt</em> ...ation. We will... <em>brzzzz</em> ...and then you will be notif... <em>krzzzzzzzzzzzz....</em>"<br> <br> 	The screen turned dark, flushing the room in darkness once again. Back to waiting.<br> <br> 	And waiting.<br> <br> 	Five months later, the solid door to his prison cell opened. A guard cuffed his hands and led him into the intergalactic prisoner convoy vehicle docked down a small corridor. Joseph squinted into the light, unable to see as he was shoved inside and shackled to the floor. The guard stood in the corner of the bright white room, watching the prisoner intently.<br> <br> 	Moments later, the ship lifted off and shot out of the building at unimaginable speed. The ship's artificial gravity, however, prevented the ship's passengers from the effects of inertia as they rocketed towards the ESCorp headquarters. A small smile appeared on Joseph's face, masked by the beard that grew during his imprisonment. He prepared himself to exploit the greatest weakness in the intergalactic prison system - all it takes is a cool head to find release.<br> <br> 	Right now, Joseph's head was as cool as it had ever been. He was ready now, to utilize the finite space inside his mind to conquer the trials of this endlessly expanding universe... by any means necessary.<br> <br> <em>To be continued</em>

I'm kinda thinking I'd like to run a parallel storyline, detailing the experiences of another prisoner, obviously. Not anytime soon, but eventually. <br>  <br> My hat's off to you!

                Thanks for the compliments, guys. And Prowlgrin, the parallel story is a neat idea <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"><br> <br> I just put the finishing touches on the first chapter. Now to get some sleep. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P"><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> ==one==<br> <br> 	Seconds passed before the speeding rocketship came to a halt. The guard stepped towards Joseph, undid the clasp holding him to the floor, and forcefully led him outside the plain white room.<br> <br> 	Joseph's eyes, finally adjusting to the light, saw that he was being taken down a corridor decorated with nothing but solid concrete, much like his cell. He correctly assumed that this was but one part of the ESCorp building, and he chewed on the thought that it took so long to send someone to his cell but only seconds to transport him back. <em>Bloody paperwork,</em> he thought, <em>how inane.</em><br> <br> 	Moments later, the hallway came to an end, with a small yet bulky metal door carved into the wall. Joseph finally got a good look at the guard leading him around; a large, muscular man with a shaved head and a black jumpsuit. He seemed like the typical strongman -  especially in his current, weakened state, he couldn't hope for escape at this moment. But he continued to keep his eyes open for possibilities.<br> <br> 	The guard took the card hanging around his neck, held it up to a scanner next to the door, then punched in a code using a numerical keypad. Finalizing the procedure by pressing his finger to a metal plate, the door slowly slid open, revealing a room slightly more homely than any Joseph had recently seen. A dark red carpet covered the floor of the small, hexagonal room. The walls were colored beige, as was the plain ceiling. A dim lamp was stood in a corner of the room, casting somewhat eerie shadows on the opposite walls. A cedar desk was positioned next to the light source, and behind it was a man. A skinny kid apparently only in his twenties; he leaned back in his swivel chair, staring at the monitor that was, apparently, the only thing the desk was holding up.<br> <br> 	The man at the desk smiled at his two visitors. "Another prisoner," he said in a relaxed, irritatingly laid-back voice. "Stay awhile... stay forever!"<br> <br> 	Joseph wondered exactly how in the universe this guy had the audacity to joke around a man who had been "staying forever" for the past three years. The guard shot the receptionist a glare, and he quickly straightened up and tapped his computer monitor.<br> <br> 	"'Kay," he said, not turning away from the screen. "We got here a 'Vaus, Joseph', imprisoned for three Earth years, five months and four days. Application for space miner submitted... three seconds after the option was given. Looks like we got ourselves some quick reflexes here, eh?"<br> <br> 	Joseph remained silent.<br> <br> 	"...Right.", said the receptionist. "Well, the name's Thomas, but you can call me Tommy. I'll be running you through the basics from here. You just need to step through the door over there." he pointed to his left. "Good luck, man."<br> <br> 	Joseph nodded and walked through the door with the guard right behind him. On the other side was a dock just like any other, with a small, yellow spaceship fueled and ready to go.<br> <br> 	The guard motioned for Joseph to enter as the top of the ship opened. He did, and the guard continued tailing him until the prisoner dropped into his new home. Once there, the guard undid his cuffs and hastily pressed a button on his wristwatch that closed and locked the ship's top, leaving Joseph alone inside.<br> <br> 	Joseph took stock of his new ship. It wasn't much different on the inside than it was on the outside - yellow. A control panel was laid out in front of a 'window', which was actually a screen connected to miniature cameras embedded into the exterior of the ship. The rest was a few seats, a large device that Joseph didn't recognize, and an internal hydrogen fuel tank.<br> <br> 	After a couple minutes, a box appered in the corner of the large screen, alerting Joseph that a new signal had been recieved. A red button labeled "accept" started blinking on the control panel. Joseph pressed the button and watched as half the screen was dedicated to the horribly composed message:<br> <br> <em>hey man!<br> <br> tommy here, let's run through the rules quick. keep the ball bouncing, don't lose track of it, the huge levers on your left control teh side engines for tight control. grab all the ore you find nd send it to us using the trnsproter. do the assignments and maybe theyll let ya off the hook. : )<br> <br> so just turn on the gas and leave the dock so we can beam ya to your new workplce!</em><br> <br> 	Joseph shook his head. He hoped Tommy was done with him, because he was already unable to stand the guy.<br> <br> 	Nonetheless, he now knew what to do next. He raised the lever labeled "Ignition", and the ship made a dull hum. He slowly increased the main throttle, navigating out of the building and into cold, dark outer space.<br> <br> 	He was hardly meters out of the door when he felt the sudden jarring sensation that always accompanied teleportation. The onscreen radar showed his new surroundings, and sitting in his inbox was a new message, titled: "ESCorp entry test".<br> <br> <em>to be continued</em>

                Yeah, I got caught up in a lot of stuff shortly after I started this.<br> <br> Most of my energy writing, at this moment, is going into songs for my band. So I will probably update the story at some point, just... not now. I don't quite have the time to invest at this time.<br> <br> Sorry <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(">
