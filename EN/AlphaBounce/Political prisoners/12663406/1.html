                This game is supposed to be fun but there are a few factors which really drags it down all the way to the sluggish bottom. First of all, the ball acceleration is just way too fast. Not fun. Some level designs are incredibly frustrating, such as having a row of silvers with a 2 brick opening in one end. And sometimes coppers before that. That's not challenge at all - that's just a mean to frustrate players. Bit more originality would've been nice. Then there's the powerup drop rate which doesn't seem to be existent sometimes. And if you ever end up in an area where all these grievances occur at once then the game just becomes a waste of time where you frantically try to get the ball up past the silverbars, without any single powerups and the ball at mach 10.<br> <br>  There's a difference between challenges and pointless designs after all.

                Once you've procured the antimatter missiles, you can blow up a 3x3 block of any type of brick ... including the silver ones. Sooooo much easier. I know what you mean about having to thread your ball through the tiniest of gaps <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":sadique:"> (and then, sometimes, it will hit <em>one single</em> brick at the top at such an angle that it comes right back down through the hole at you. ugh. That was sooooo freakin' frustrating.)<br> <br> What really helps in that case is deploying one of your Black Hole or Glacial capsules from your reserves (the ones you can buy from merchants ... pause the game in mid-play, making sure that the ball isn't gonna zip past your <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_pad.gif" alt=":pad:"> the very instant you unpause the game ... preferably when the ball is on its way upwards ... and pick which capsule you wanna use).

                Just as a note, there isn't really a powerup drop rate; from my experience, it seems that certain powerups are assigned to certain positions in certain coordinates. (As far as I can tell, they're not assigned to specific bricks; e.g. getting <strong>[O]</strong> should change which blocks hold the level's powerups.)<br> <br> I haven't had much of the troubles that you have, even in the levels you described, but I've been playing Arkanoid for a long time, so I'm used to inhumanly fast ball speeds. That might just be me, I dunno.<br> <br> I will say that difficulty jumps in certain areas are... surprising, to say the least. (For example, Lycans is usually pretty darn easy, except for this one cluster in the lower right with some of the more difficult stages I've played yet. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_huh.gif" alt=":huh:"><br> <br> I also second Prowlgrin's comment that Glacial capsules are <em>lifesavers</em>. Indispensable, to be sure.<br> <br> I will agree that sometimes finding a wall of really tough sectors can be somewhat annoying, especially when us without the money and/or means to pay for <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel.gif" alt=":fuel:"> end up blowing all our <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel_free.gif" alt=":free:"> for a couple days trying to get through or around the natural barrier. But hey, that's the nature of the game, I guess. It's a minor complaint in comparison to all the upsides AB has <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D"><br> <br> I find it comes down to having the right mood in the right environment. I always play in the most quiet room of the house, and with a nice, hot cup of tea as needed. XD<br> <br> (also, IBM laptops with the TrackPoint mouse are very nice for this game. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)">)

                Acceleration is nothing. I haven't lost a level yet due to acceleration, generally having spent a substantial part of my youth on arcade games I have no problem passing the levels unless one of the following crap happens:<br> <br> 1. Pointer out of the game error. The pointer is useless most of the time, and its y axis always actually, still the game keeps distracting me with dumb flashing warning. To make it even more annoying, ignoring the dumb flash leads to failing the level and loss of crystal. Not funny.<br> <br> 2. Network-related errors. Stalling, skipping, losing fuel on connection breaks etc. Another pointless frustration especially since there is no sensible reason for the game to be online (no interaction between players for instance).<br> <br> 3. Untranslated parts, that turn out to be about everything on the surface of the planets. The text is in flash, so can't copy and paste into a translator either. <br> <br> <br> Some other stuff that doesn't make you die is not milk and honey either:<br> <br> 4. Coordinates. Do they teach maths upside down in France?<br> <br> 5. Costs of upgrades. What's the reason for drone #2 to be twice as expensive as drone #1? It doesn't seem to do anything more or better than the first one. Same with missiles. That aside, drones themselves are annoying as well. <br> <br> 6. Real money costs of crystals. Ofcourse it's up to the players to be so stupid to spend ridiculous money for halfassed production rather than get Master of Orion, Supremacy, Arkanoid and other classics this game was ripped from, for free - still seeing that happen in a broad daylight is a nuisance. Luckily it gets boring quick so no more money from me at least.<br> <br> 7. Plot holes. Too much to mention. Barely anything about the "storyline" makes sense. My favourite is bringing 4 antimatter particles so the constructors of the Biggest Antimatter Reactor will be able to upgrade your missiles. Yeah right, they need the Biggest Reactor to produce missiles and only other thing they need is 4 particles. Gimme a break.<br> <br> I'll pass for now, maybe playing 3 games a day won't bother me as much as the (lack of) value for money I've spent on this game so far. Good luck wasting your cash!

                I'll just answer to some of your points...if not all <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:"><br> <br> 1: you can deactivate this in your preferences (the tool icon in the map's bottom-left corner).<br> <br> 2: connection errors are most likely unrelated to Motion Twin, even though I agree sometimes it can be (like this afternoon). On my side I've lost only 1 <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel.gif" alt=":fuel:"> from a connection error out of about 2000 plays. I think we can get over it.<br> <br> 3: I'm currently translating what's left, and the work will be submitted by thursday next week.<br> <br> 4: we're in space, and in the future. This is a game. things change with time, so once again, I think you can get over it... <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":innocent:"><br> <br> 5: get the shop list posted on the forum for lowest prices. If you buy a car and want another twice as powerful, I don't think it will cost only twice as much... <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_wink2.gif" alt=":wink:"><br> <br> 6: if you don't like it here, then I guess the best solution for you is to click that little red cross located on this window's corner. This has already been discussed...you have 3 free plays a day + extras when you start. You can also get some in the game from your <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_mineral.gif" alt=":mineral:">. Still unhappy? No one's holding you back.<br> <br> 7: once again, it's a game...a little imagination never hurt anyone before <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"><br> <br> (guess I answered it all <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o">)<br> <br> This may seem quite harsh, but I'm trying to be nice to everyone, and you've just brought up anything I get to see every day all put together. Not that I want to defend Motion Twin, as I am neutral, but I'm feeling as if you're trying as hard as you can not to like this game <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":innocent:"><br> <br> Good morning/day/night, whatever time it may be where you are.

                personally i like the game. <br> about the difficult levels: i enjoy the silver block challenges because then it becomes a waiting game until i get a free Javelin at which point i can get revenge! but the levels with lasers, skulls, and things like that are very hard.<br> <br> all in all a great game, i wish it was cheaper though! <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_cry.gif" alt=":pleure:"> i can't spend $75 for a few hours of gaming!

                As for your replies Moneymaker:<br> <br> 1. Thanks for the tip. The flashing doesn't bother me anymore, but for a good balance now the game just ends at random, even with pointer in the very middle of the arcade zone.<br> <br> 2. I'd prefer if Motion Twin could rather get over connection errors and stop stealing my capsules away. Even better would be of course either to limit connections to updating highscores or to make it a real online RPG where players can meet/compete/cooperate etc, but I guess that's too much work for the game that costs 5€ for several hrs of gameplay.<br> <br> 3. Looks like a bit of work left, since as I said I haven't met any english speaking inhabitant on any planet just yet. Well, good luck helping MT make money. Pun intended.<br> <br> 4. Yeah, and since we're in space, lower coordinates mean going up. Obvious, dumb me.<br> <br> 5. I've got the shop list, I still fail to make sense of the fact that 2 exactly same drones come for the price of 3, and 3 drones for the price of 6. Unless the fact the latter drones jump into the action later than the first is supposed to justify this.<br> <br> As for the irrelevant car example, I'd rather expect twice-as-powerful car to cost less than 2x as much, given it barely needs some parts tweaked rather than eight wheels and two engines.<br> <br> 6. Thanks for kindly reminding me of my freedoms. I also happen to have the freedom of voicing my opinion, so I prefer to do it and get others to think before they waste their real money on this. Or get the developers to work before ppl vote by doing what you recommend, clicking the exit button that is.<br> <br> Other than this, "my way or the highway" is not exactly the way you work in the free market.<br> <br> 7. Yeah imagination helps when one tries to make money by designing games. That's why ppl like Sid Meier are rich and famous and others, well just have to copycat and expect the users to think for them. And translate.<br> <br> Cheers.

                fce2&gt;<br> <br> 1. Could you be more specific about your problem and post it in the thread regrouping all bugs? Like this some users could help you and if eventually an admin comes by (good luck on that one <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:"> ), he could fix something <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"><br> <br> 2. we all agree on the fact that copnnection erors are annoying and we all want them to disappear, we've reported this to the admins but never got any answer...<br> <br> 3. All landing texts are currently in French (except for 1 or 2 inhabitants). Once an admin will validate the file, which should be sent soon enough, they should be quite more understandable.<br> <br> 4. As Musaran said, it's more of a programming issue <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:"> anyway you can see all coordinates on the map by moving your pointer around, just compare 2 different spots to know which way is where you have to go...of course it would have been better the right way up, but putting it back would mean changing every misison's data for coordinates, etc. Not saying it's obvious, but there's nearly no way you can get it wrong since coordinates show up <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":innocent:"><br> <br> 5. For the drones, well it's just like any item such as extra missiles, extra mines, etc. it is quite questionable and has never been brought up in the French section as far as I know, but I'm guessing every one takes it as granted...nothing we can really change, is there?<br> <br> 6. Of course you have freedom of speech, no one will say you don't...Last time osmeone brought up this subject in a similar way, the thread went way off topic, and people started arguing in an unacceptable manner. At that time I wasn't moderator, but the discussion was so inappropriate that even a moderator which didn't speak English perfectly could understand the thread had to be locked (and it got deleted for some unknown reason). As we had said there and elsewhere, there are nearly 200 000 users out here, and it's not like -1 could do much difference, unfortunately. In the French section we've even tried to launch a boycotting period, when we were out of news from the admins for over a month. Not like it changed much for them <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_sad.gif" alt=":("> So yes you can talk about this and all, but er...please try and not make it go out of bounds as it did before <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":innocent:"><br> <br> With other players we've also determined that there are some very simple things to do that could be changed and they could earn more money, but they don't even do it so all I can say is "too bad for them" <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_keepcool.gif" alt="X)"><br> <br> 7. True. Motion Twin is know for taking old-school/board games and make them into websites. Now for plot holes well I guess there are more important problems (there is a HUGE list of bugs in the French forums, and we never had any aswer about that).<br> <br> Have a nice day.
