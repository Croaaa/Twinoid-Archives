                First of all, calm down.<br> <br> Secondly, a screen shot would be really useful, but if I understand what you're saying right, having bricks on the very lowest row they can be is against the rules for levels inside the belt.<br> <br> However, a mod does have to OK these zones when a member edits them, so It could be a mod slip up.

You may be frustrated, but such rhetoric is uncalled for and plain illogical.<br> <br> <cite>this is way too close to the origin to put a level like that so he can put his high score at top</cite><br> This game doesn't even have a score. The closest thing to a "high score" is exploration count, which is pretty negligible concerning one level.<br> <br> <cite>if mommy bought me capsules whenever i want and i didnt have other things to do LIKE WORK..i am sure i could be up there too</cite><br> Again, don't like baseless statements like these. Have you ever considered some people are up in the rankings <em>because</em> they have work and get good pay?

You just said so yourself that what's hard for one person may be easy to another.

For the record, I'm not the one that validated any edits to this particular level.<br> <br> <cite>No matter how you look at it, only someone inconsiderate of others would put a wall right there in an intermediate area.</cite><br> Uhh...apparently that's false because clearly there are others that see it differently.<br> <br> <cite>My complaint was that the mods should have caught this</cite><br> I'll tell you what.

But with a level as close to the origin as that one is and with millions of players, don't you someone other than yourself must have played it after 2009?<br> Also, the level is clearly on at least <em>a</em> map. Otherwise, I never would have gotten that screenshot given my location right now.<br> <br> One final note: I suggest you listen Jtrillo's advice of calming down. You're frustrated. We get that. However, there is no need for that kind of behaviour in the forum. If you don't better control your tone, I may have to give you some time to cool down.

I dont use the map doing these missions, it wouldnt matter i had to do ti ti finish.   there are levels in vivinty that have there hard area but there is always one weakspt  to cncentrate on.

Its within mission range. <br> I have to laugh about calming down..glad your a psycologist:<img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idee:"> yep i just tore up my desk and threw my laptop against the wall.  <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:"><br> <br> s o do a favor, figure out  a way to make a paddle control with a USB port..then we can both be happy, yu get rich and i  get though this with ease.  I ues to get the highscore at breakout but cant keep trackf that  little dot with mouse. actually  as many people who have paid for this i am suprized they havent made this to where you wont leave the screen if your mouse goes t far up r down. the idea is great of this game but the mechanics needs help<br> I never  got into video games..does the nintendo version have everything  here? maybe i can get ne cheap...be  less thant buying  capsules t o get t o60 cleanups
