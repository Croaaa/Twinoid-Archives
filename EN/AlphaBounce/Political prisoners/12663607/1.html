                While this will not be anywhere near a comprehensive guide. I think sometimes we get wrapped so far up into the game we end up making it far too difficult for ourselves to actually succeed at it. Time and time again I've been playing a level and either by stupid mistake or other confluence of events I've lost an envelope. I think to myself "That could have easily been avoided." I think that this will help people make decisions during gameplay that will not only increase their enjoyment of the game, but also play better as well.<br> <br> Or maybe I'm just making it all up and feel like wasting some time writing, who knows.  <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)"><br> <br> <em>Your Worst Enemy</em><br> In this game there is one primary reason you die. You miss your ball and it falls below screen. There are secondary reasons, such as the skull-and-crossbones brick or several of the "falling debris" bricks. But mainly, especially if you stay near the primary planets, you die because you miss the ball.<br> <br> Now, this is pretty obvious. And I'm going to state something more obvious: usually, you miss the ball because it is simply traveling too fast and you can't keep up with it. But herein lies the problem. The longer the level you are playing goes on, the faster the ball gets. This is the crux of the problem, but once it's defined a whole slew of solutions evolve from it.<br> <br> <strong>Time is your enemy.</strong> In this game, the longer you play the harder it gets to continue playing. Tracking a fast-moving ball requires a bunch of attention and instead of making accurate, well-placed shots, you are simply slamming your envelope into position under the ball in hopes that it takes out those last remaining bricks, or you're able to thread the ball into that opening of indestructibles.<br> <br> Knowing this, you should realize that the <strong>[ N ]</strong> (New ball) powerup, especially late in a level is your best friend. It is essentially a free envelope to start the level over with a fresh, slow-moving ball that you can better control and aim. Also, sacrificing your ball to grab an <strong>[ S ]</strong> (Safety - extra envelope) powerup is something I do commonly. I will also try to control my drilling to the point where I don't start going after the encased ball bricks until late in a level when I need to slow things down.<br> <br> When multiple balls are flying around the screen it's hard to keep track of them all, sometimes, after several <strong>[ M ]</strong> (Multiball) powerups I have upwards of 8-10 balls flying around, it's nearly impossible to follow them all and some invariably get lost. What I do try to do, however, is prioritize the slow-moving balls over the fast ones. That way I'm able to scoop fast balls if possible to quickly clear bricks, but I always make sure that the slow ones come first to prolong the envelope's life as much as possible. Obviously, if the faster balls are imbued with a Volt or Halo, I do my best to retain them as long as possible.<br> <br> <br> <em>Know which powerups are helpful.</em><br> Aside from knowing just what every powerup does and which ones are truly beneficial, it's good to know what context a powerup is good for. I've found that several times I've sacrificed my envelope scrambling to hit a powerup <em>and</em> my ball at the same time and then later realizing that the powerup was essentially worthless anyway. I'm not going to go over each and every powerup, but here are a few that really need to get taken into consideration.<br> <br> <strong>Attraction</strong> - I don't really use this one unless there's a way to get my ball "stuck" above a wall of bricks. It's great for control, but if the level is open, this is pretty worthless.<br> <br> <strong>Flame</strong> - This one is brutal on certain levels and <em>completely worthless</em> on others. If your level has little to no bricks that take multiple hits, don't even bother scampering for it. I've died many times going after this to realize later that there aren't even any brown bricks in the level.<br> <br> <strong>Glacial</strong> - I'm not a big fan of this, I usually avoid it, in fact. Only when a level has severe congestion of dangerous (or unbreakable) bricks do a bust this one out.<br> <br> <strong>Kamikaze</strong> - Get this one at all costs! Even if you don't hit your ball there's a good chance that it will curve up from below your envelope and clear the <em>whole</em> level for you. Just don't get any other ball powerup afterwards.<br> <br> <strong>Laser</strong> - I love this one. But while it's falling, take stock of the level. If there are indestructible blocks on the level, <em>everything</em> above them you won't be able to hit with lasers. Is it really worth it?<br> <br> <strong>Opening and Quasar</strong> - Sometimes this can make the level more difficult or, even worse, push valuable minerals off the level. It really depends on the terrain you're facing.<br> <br> <strong>Regeneration</strong> - Get this at all costs! Right when you touch it, click once to generate a ball. That way, even if you miss the ball that's in play you have one safe on your envelope. Once you click, <em>don't do anything</em> until the red bar is full. Once that bar is full, the current ball will disengage automatically. Click again to generate another ball stuck to your paddle and bounce the other one around while the bar fills again. <em>You literally can't lose if you use it like this.</em><br> <br> <strong>Transmutation</strong> - See if there are any blocks worthy of transmuting before getting this. If there are indestructibles or, worse, purples, <em>get this</em>. It's nice to have otherwise, but it's not always beneficial. It spams the screen with color, making it hard to see your ball.<br> <br> <strong>Volt</strong> - This powerup ends levels for me. Getting this usually guarantees that I'll win.<br> <br> <strong>Xanax</strong> - This buys you time, get it at all costs, even if it makes your ball <em>painfully</em> slow.<br> <br> <strong>-----------------------</strong><br> <br> I have many more thoughts on this topic, but this stuff has bounced around in my head <em>(har har, no pun intended)</em> for weeks now while I obsess over the game. I hope this opens some eyes as to how to be more efficient while brick bustin'.<br> <br> -bFusion

                Excellent guide! I agree with the powerup suggestions. Volt is probably my favorite powerup, and Halo is great in the beggining of a level. Lasers and Regenerate are no brainers.<br> <br> I will go after Glacier on levels that really make use of it. Right now on Balixt I like to get them because it helps out my single Drone because I can destroy the reducines myself. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)">

                Nice guide. Interestingly, that method of using <strong>[ R ]</strong> never entered my mind. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_wink2.gif" alt=":wink:"><br> <br> Also, something I found useful: If you have lots of balls onscreen, Attraction can be a huge help in grouping them so you can hit them all. It's its only really helpful use imo.

                Excellent advices.<br> <br> Even experienced players may not have thought it all by themselves and may learn something new.<br> <br> <br> <strong>A</strong>ttraction<br> Moderately useful but hard to control.<br> Fire it only the time necessary to change ball course (less than a second).<br> If you fire it constantly ball will not stick to your envelope, but instead repeatedly bounce on it until it drops.<br> <br> <strong>C</strong>atch<br> Use and abuse towards end of level so autojavelin charges.<br> <br> <br> <strong>I</strong>ndigestion<br> Sometimes useful if the ball went into some cavity or above an obstacle: it could close the way out and force it to rampage.<br> You can also try it for new bonuses on empty cells, if you feel lucky.<br> <br> <strong>J</strong>avelin<br> Do not just destroy the biggest column, instead destroy the most annoying bricks!<br> It can be the ones you can't destroy with the ball, or those in the way, or those that will be hard to reach towards end of level.<br> If there is no clear choice, go for the side columns as top corner bricks are hard to reach.<br> <br> <strong>T</strong>ransform<br> To reduce the blinding effect, fire it far from where you will catch the ball, so that when you do catch it the rays are sideways, thus not in the way.<br> To reduce exhaust-reaim-refire hassle, wait for full charge then fire continuously: one full charge = one brick transformed, so no need to reaim for that one.<br> And remember: it harvests minerals.<br> <br> <strong>Y</strong>oyo<br> Usefull with one ball as it slows near envelope for easier catch and accelerates when away so it saves time.<br> Horrible with multiball because you must stay longer under each ball.

                Wow, I wasn't aware that if you Transformed a mineral, you collected it. I always thought it was gone forever. Guess I don't hate Transform as much now.<br> <br> Another tip for Javelin is to be careful and take your time with it. I know I've shot it quickly sometimes without thinking it through and just got rid of some pointless brown blocks or missed entirely because I was in a rush. Using your head and not losing your cool is one of the top skills with the Javelin powerup.

                <em>Controlling Control</em><br> The <strong>[ C ]</strong> (Control) powerup is one of the most effective tools you can use while drilling. It's premise is simple: Any ball that hits your envelope sticks to it. You can disengage the ball by clicking your mouse, or if you wait several seconds it will disengage automatically. One exception to note is that if your ball is under the influence of the <strong>[ H ]</strong> (Halo) powerup, <em>it will not stick to your envelope</em>. It is also noteworthy to mention that if you hold down the mouse button, the ball will bounce without sticking.<br> <br> Control is best used to snipe certain bricks, or to line up a shot in order to thread your ball into an area. But it's much more useful than that. Since the ball sticks you can work on certain areas of the level at a time and when it's clear you can simply catch and move to another area. You are also able to better control the tempo of your game. Instead of frantically moving to catch the ball, you are able to aim, fire, and catch in a very controlled, intentional manner.<br> <br> It is important with control that you are able to understand the vector your released ball will travel by. It is obvious that the closer to the center of your envelope the ball bounces, the more vertical it's trajectory. But mastering the art of sniping blocks by positioning your envelope relative to the ball on it is especially important.<br> <br> The key to this is using your mouse cursor. Your envelope's center is always positioned where your mouse cursor is. This means that when a ball is stuck on your envelope, you can just bring the mouse cursor down to it and get an approximation as to what direction and at what angle the ball will fly when released.<br> <br> Another major benefit of Control is crowd control. When you have multiple balls flying at once it's extremely beneficial to be able to stick them all at once and shotgun the playing field with a barrage. Doing this usually involves sacrificing about half the balls in play simply because they all come back at the same time, but sometimes it's worth it.<br> <br> While you control multiple balls there is one thing to keep in mind. Balls can't go off the side of the level. A ball with automatically disengage from your envelope if it's carried off the screen. Using this knowledge to your advantage; you can disengage a single ball from your envelope simply by scooting it off the level. All the other balls will stay stuck as long as that single ball comes back before the release timer (which I think is about 5 seconds) hits. This way, you create a safety net of sorts, even if you lose the one ball, you'll have several others waiting to be used on your envelope.<br> <br> I love the Control powerup late in a level when things start getting out of control. Early in the game I still get it, but I just keep the mouse button held down to hurry up progression of the level. It's one of the more basic powerups and is generally lower on my list compared to Laser or Regeneration, but it's far more common and still incredibly useful.<br> <br> -bFusion

                <em>Controlling control (Addendum)</em><br> <br> One thing I forgot to mention while using control is a solid multiball strategy for <em>keeping</em> most of the balls in play. You should really try to do your best to stack the balls on top of each other on the envelope. That was when they get released, they will fly all in the same direction and take out a large group of bricks in the same area. They will be more centralized and easier to catch on their way down as well.<br> <br> This isn't always the easiest tactic to do, but it's one of the best ways to utterly decimate bricks that take multiple hits in a controlled fashion.<br> <br> -bFusion

                ??? I think that Attraction on Spygnisos is the WORST bonus, because ball in 9 times from 10 will fall UNDER your envelope...

                I'm sorry if this is further off track, but I have something to say about the attraction power up. If you mess with it just right, it's very useful.<br> <br> Attract the ball when it's flying across the screen away from you for just a moment. If you're lucky, it'll start going sideways. Then click again to turn the ball to an easy-to-hit angle.

                That's not off-track, it's great to know. I love doing that, just tapping the mouse in an attempt to get your ball "stuck" somewhere and then when it rockets back, just click again to direct it right at your envelope.<br> <br> Maybe I'll write more about that... there's a lot to say there.

                Attraction does attract the ball exactly at your envelopes center if the ball is above a certain height ánd when you don't move the pad. The combination 'pulling the ball sideways when going up', and 'back to your envelope when going down' is now very usefull for me. At first I hated attraction, but now I start to love it. Master the skill and you will like it too! <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_yeah.gif" alt=":youpi:">

                Another side note about attraction: Halo balls lose their "ghosting" as soon as you change their direction with attraction. You can easily get them stuck in particular areas that aren't at the top of the screen with that maneuver.

                There's the Whisky powerup, it is useful but it is a little hard to control, last time I got it I lose because i hit in the edge of the envelope and it made a curve impossible to hit the ball. It is useful but it can be deadly too.

                Excellent breakdown of the powerups and how to use them to maximum effect!  Every time I thought "Oh cool! I'll get to add this tip!" I ended up reading it a little further down. hah.  Very cool!<br> <br> The only thing I didn't see mentioned (sorry if I missed it) was to use [C] catch to help give your drones time dismantle sentinels and such.  That can be a real life-saver on Balixt.  The key there is to give your little guys enough time to do their work.  Every second you stall, is a second longer you're not scrambling to catch an ultra-fast ball.<br> <br> As for halo being useless on Balixt, in most cases..yes.  But I believe there was one or two cases where you could get the ball stuck up high and it didn't matter if you shrunk down to nothing.  It still can take out tons of blocks that'll save you headache later... hopefully while your drones do some damage too.<br> <br> Great post though!

                I got to know Attraction better... it is pretty versatile and quite powerful if used right.<br> <br> The things to understand is that:<br> 1) Activating it does not simply draw the ball to the pad, it bends the ball's trajectory towards it. The longer it activates, the more the bending.<br> 2) The ball bends on the side of shorter turn to the pad.<br> <br> Imagine a line prolonging the ball's trajectory down until it crosses the bottom.<br> If the pad is on the right of the crossing, the ball will curve right.<br> If the pad is on the left of the crossing, the ball will curve left.<br> <br> With that in mind you can, say, send the ball straight up on the side of an obstacle, and then make it do a 90° turn above it by placing the pad correctly and activating Attraction very briefly.

                Another quirk of Halo blocks: an Attract will snap them back to physical (so they won't float through your paddle). Use this to make them appear <strong>inside</strong> large areas of blocks.

                You know, there's a WONDERFUL trick you can use.<br> If you have Multiball and Control, DON'T CLICK TO RELEASE ALL THE BALLS AT ONCE. Instead, go to the edge of the screen and release ONLY ONE BALL. This way, you can keep playing without the other being released automatically. You can do this only if the first ball you launch isn't TOO slow. If so, the second ball WILL launch.<br> <br> This is the way it works:<br> <br> If you try to keep the balls in the <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_pad.gif" alt=":pad:"> , after some secs, the game releases them automatically. But, if you release at least ONE ball, the timer resets. If the first ball returns to your ball before the timer is over, it resets AGAIN. Then you can do this over and over again.<br> <br> If you have more than two balls, you will have as many "lives" as balls. <br> <br> Of course it is a slow way of playing, but, trust me, it's VERY safe.

                Halo requires thought before you collect it... if there are blocks that have unbreakable blocks above them halo makes it much harder of even impossible in some cases to get to them. So it's best to be careful before deciding to get halo, because having to give up a life just so you can hit the blocks isn't good.<br> <br> Be careful with glacial too because if it hits a ? block or a block with minerals in you dont get them.<br> <br> Some cool tips in this topic that i hadnt thought of tho, will be helpful in the future i think.

                Try not to aim your ball to a long flat surface (several blocks at the same height) when you want to pick up a multiball powerup. The balls will bounce back at the same time and most likely in other directions... you can't catch them both.

                It isn't so. Balls will ALWAYS bounce under different angles.<br> <br> About the [B] powerdown, it's working only on normal bricks. Brown are left as they were. <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)">
