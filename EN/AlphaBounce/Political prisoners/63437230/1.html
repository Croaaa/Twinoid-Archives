                <p>So I had an intricate plan for alphabounce. I had both the rest of the game figured out as well as my retirement after the fact. When I first learned about flash ending at the end of 2020, I realized that I had to get a move on and needed to mine minerals so that I could have enough SHC to comfortably finish. On the other hand, knowing that it was going to end soon caused me to lose a lot of enthusiasm for the game because I wanted to finish it <strong>and</strong> have a post-game. So when doing the mining route got boring (I didn't even finish it once) and my life got busy, I just stopped playing. Now, at this point, I've lost so much time that I don't think it's realistic to get back into it. Technically, I could do a bunch of mining routes and still finish the game, but that requires both time for the mining routes <strong>and</strong> time to spend my excess SHC. Time that I don't think I have. So, for all intents and purposes, my AB character is dead. My character planned out how he was going to live his life and retirement, but death caught him before he had the chance.</p><p>If there is ever any news that Alphabounce will continue after 2020, please send me a message. I would very much like to play again, but I want to do it slowly at my own pace.</p>

                <p>I'm sure there are still quite a few users that still purchase off their site and the fact their servers are still up goes to show they keep making money. That said, if the transition isn't too complicated and costly to warrant shut down, I don't see why they would do it in 2020. They wouldn't have waited until then if their services weren't profitable is all I'm saying. That is the only argument that brings me hope.</p><p>On the other hand what worries me is that they haven't posted anything in the last 3.5 years, which is the longest without an update. On top of that, support is basically dead I mean once I tried reaching them about payment issues and apparently my messages were delivered to what it seems like a computer that nobody knows about. I mean, ok maintenance is one thing -old game n all- but somebody wants to send you money and you don't want it? That don't look too promising.</p><p>So I dunno, guess time will tell. I suggest y'all do what makes you happier and when the time comes we'll either be here or we won't. I still purchase <img src="//data.twinoid.com/proxy/www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_s_fuel.gif" alt=":ab_fr:" class="tid_ico"> from time to time, playing one level after another as I drift through space, not knowing where I will be by the time all this could be over.

MT is now making full release games the first of which is dead cells which I'm sure is the first in a long list of self published PC/Console games. So they'll have players that'll play a game like Dead Cells and be like "man I LOVE this game I wonder what what other games this dev has made that I can purchase". At which point they'll google Motion Twin to find more games. What MT def doesn't want to happen is for a dead web site with a bunch of flash games that can't be played because flash isn't supported by their browser to come up.</p><p>Companies pay a lot of money for search engine optimization and leaving twinoid up pretty much works against that.</p>

Collect the 3 missiles at [380][-79], [282][40], and [147][155]. Explore D-Tritus, Samosa, and Tarciturne. Buy Surface engine 2.<br>4. Complete 100 Cleanup missions and collect the envelope extension.<br>5. Collect remaining missiles. Explore every planet except for Folket and the planets inside the Karbonis Belt. Buy Mine 1 and some Drones.<br>6. Travel on Launcelot's mineral path. Buy Ultimate pod extension. Explore Folket.<br>7. Explore every planet except for Lycans.<br>8. Explore Lycans and complete the PID Map.<br>9. Venture to Terre and explore it.<br>10. Return to the origin with my new upgrades. Roll a d100 dice to decide whether I will complete 200 missions, retire, or start over again in Nightmare Mode.<br>With the previous semester being over, I finally had the time to create a detailed plan based off this general one on my "Alphabounce Plan" Excel spreadsheet for everything leading up until Terre.<br><br>I'm actually going to do step 6 before I complete 100 Cleanup missions because I want to actually make use of the Ultimate pod extension after I get it.

I see no point perfecting my profile if it means needing to take extra time to mine. As of now, I will still try to do 100% of the planets and to follow my plan as if there was no end. However, I will not roll a d100 to decide my fate and will instead choose to begin my retirement.</p><p>My retirement is simple: Explore a never-ending cleanup around the perimeter of Terre as if I am trying to free myself even further by taking the space territory away from ESCORP and giving it back to Terre to own. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>
