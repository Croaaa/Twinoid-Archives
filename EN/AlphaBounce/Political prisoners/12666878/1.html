                <em>This is a story. If you're trying to play this game without spoiling anything at all, be aware that this post contains minor spoilers regarding a couple plot points and one planet.</em><br> <br> Honestly, he didn't know how he got stuck with this job. It was a lot of travel for a lot of nothing. And yet here he was, guiding his ship through the atmosphere of another barren planet. His job was to look for people. He never seemed to find any.<br> <br> <em>Crash.</em> His ship landed not too skillfully on the rose-red surface. As he donned his spacesuit and hopped out onto the rocky ground, he remembered the fresh coat of paint he just applied at the last merchant's shop. He considered looking back to make sure that landing didn't scratch it up, but then he realized he didn't really care. It's not like anyone ever saw it.<br> <br> He resolved to put in at least a token effort, running a lap around the ship while keeping an eye out for anyone. It was only an instant after the thought crossed his mind that he heard a slight clunk followed by a harsh crescendo. The familiar sound of a laser shotgun powering up. Just great.<br> <br> He turned in place to see another humanoid standing atop a hill, donning a pale yellow spacesuit and aiming the shotgun straight towards his head. The spacesuit had four arms, but two of them hung limp. He figured it was a human with really bad taste in outerwear. Most importantly, however, on his shoulder there was a blue shield decorated with gold stripes.<br> <br> The mysterious figure spoke up. "Name and rank, soldier." The voice was feminine. Huh. At some other time, he might have appreciated the companionship, but he found it hard to care about anything anymore.<br> <br> "Nice gun," he replied, "I love antiques. What is that, Balixtean make? I thought the Balixteans upgraded their military weapons a while back."<br> <br> No response from the woman. She repeated, "Name and rank."<br> <br> The man threw his arms up. "Hey hey, now. I'm not a soldier. I don't like taking sides, I'm just here to help people. And it looks like you're fine here, so..."<br> <br> "Wait!" The woman jumped down off the hill and landed gracefully on the rocky surface. The stripes on her shoulder fell to the ground. They were just a cheap imitation covering her real rank: a low-ranking FURI rebel. Huh. Interesting.<br> <br> She lowered her weapon and powered it off. "I've been stranded here for over a year. My ship got clipped by a Kashuat and I've been stuck ever since."<br> <br> The man nodded. "I see. Come on, hop aboard and I'll get you out of here."<br> <br> They returned to the man's ship and took off.<br> <br> Once safely out of the planet's atmosphere, the pilot let the ship hover and spun his chair around to face his passenger. "So, got a name? Got a face?"<br> <br> The woman removed her helmet, revealing her long, black, disheveled hair, her pale, hazel eyes, and a couple nasty-looking scars across her face. She looked tired, weak, and somewhat mistrusting.<br> <br> The pilot took his own helmet off. He had short red hair, ultraviolet-polarized contact lenses, and a rough, hardened look about him. "Don't worry," he said, "I'm not ESCorp. I'm not here to turn anyone in."<br> <br> "Who are you working for, then?" she replied.<br> <br> "I serve... a higher power. It turns out there's been quite a bit of interest in ESCorp's drilling program as of late, and it's been spreading to former miners - like yourself, I imagine - who have settled on distant planets. Basically, a lot of people want to get back into the game, and my job is to help them relaunch. If you want, I can get you a new drilling ship and you can be on your way. Think about it, but in the meantime I'll ask again... got a name?"<br> <br> Somewhat reluctantly, the woman answered, "Anima Nightswimmer, FURI, Zonkerian branch. Can I ask, though, why anyone would be interested in the ESCorp program?"<br> <br> The man leaned back in his chair. "Well, you see, there's a company back on Earth that manufactures portable touchscreen entertainment devices and ships them to different locations throughout the universe. They've really caught on here in the Zonkerian system. Recently, the ESCorp created a simulation - more like a game - of the ESCorp's mining ops. It's supposed to create interest in their scouting division. They're calling the game 'AlphaBounce' or something like that. They've been transmitting it to everyone's system for a minimal fee of 5 Earth dollars, so almost everyone around has played it. The problem is, they decided to make the in-game envelopes much more powerful and easier to control than real ones, without making the drilling operation itself any harder, so a lot of people have signed up as scouts only to crash and burn. To make manners worse, the "B" pill in the game actually creates a helpful shield. Many scouts have died because they picked up a "B" pill thinking that it would help them. They also colored the "B" pill dark blue in-game, so there's been quite a problem with scouts accidentally grabbing "I" pills based on their color too."<br> <br> "That's horrible," Anima said. "But what does this have to do with me?"<br> <br> "You see, our organization exists for one major purpose. If someone, based on their experience with this new 'AlphaBounce' game, wants to get back into <em>real</em> mining operations, we provide their roleplaying character with convenient plot devices so they can explain why they've been away so long."<br> <br> Anima blinked. "Um... what?"<br> <br> The pilot smiled. "Don't think about it too hard. So, if you want to get back into a mining ship and join your rebel friends, I can provide you with the means. You may want to get some practice first, though... you're probably really rusty."<br> <br> "Look," she replied, "we're above the surface of Holovan, for God's sake. It doesn't matter whether I'm rusty or not, I'm going to die as soon as you let me within range of those Kashuats."<br> <br> "Good point. Tell you what. Go get something to eat and I'll get a ship ready. I'll fly out of Holovan's range and let you go wherever it is you want to go. Beyond that, I can't help you."<br> <br> Anima smiled. "Thank you."<br> <br> The pilot nodded and turned back to the ship's controls. Thirty Earth minutes later, Anima returned from the ship's supply room and said, "Alright, I'm ready to go."<br> <br> The pilot replied, "Your ship should be in the docking bay, fueled up and ready to go. Good luck out there."<br> <br> Anima nodded in thanks and then climbed a ladder down to the docking bay. There she saw a shiny new envelope, with a fresh blue coat of paint. She climbed in and got behind the controls. As she began the initation sequence, a nostalgic thrill swept through her.<br> <br> It sure was good to get back in the game.<br> <br> <em>Hey, everyone. For those who aren't sure what this post is about (probably most of you): I was a fairly active player a while back. When I was playing, I had a tendency to get really in-character on the forums. Anima Nightswimmer was (and I guess still is) the character I would "roleplay" for this game. AlphaBounce DSi renewed my interest in the game, so I decided that the best way to let people know I'm playing again would be through another in-character story, explaining why I suddenly vanished for so long. I'm not sure how many people are still here who would remember me though, but oh well. Gotta flex the creative muscles somehow.</em>

                Heh, thanks guys. I forgot how awesome this game was, but I'm glad to be flying again. (The multitude of "Bad Luck" entries in a row in my mission history might have clouded my judgement. I really hate Holovan.)

I'd wouldn't be active enough to be any use right now. I might take you up on that later, though <img src="http://www.alphabounce.com/img/forum/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)">
