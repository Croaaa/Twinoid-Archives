                <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, the spiritual successor to the old W2N and previous Die2Nite writing contests is here! This is where talented players from all over the World Beyond gather to show off their literary skill! And this time with a prize! Courtesy of Epoq and MT, the winner of our contest wins the magnificent prize of <strong>15 Hero Days.<br></strong></p><p>I've taken and simplified some of the old contest rules to make them friendlier and more fun. Basically:</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/icons/r_heroac.gif" alt=":hordes_heroac_15:" class="tid_ico">Die2Write is a writing contest. All of the Die2Nite players are welcome to participate. The contest is made of <strong>three rounds</strong>, each with a different theme. All of the qualifying entries will be scored by our set of judges (more on that later). The participant with the highest score at the end of the three rounds will get the prize. So let's get going!</p><p>In order to qualify, entries must follow these simple rules:<br><strong><br>Rules:</strong></p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico">All entries must be related to or based on Die2Nite.<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico">An entry is eligible if it is written between the launch date of the round and the deadline of the round, which is one week from today.<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_arrow.gif" alt=":hordes_fleche:" class="tid_ico">Upon submission, the author assures that the work is fully theirs and is not plagiarized. If plagiarism is discovered, the offender will be permanently banned from the contest. Show some creativity, people!<br><strong><br>Judging:</strong></p><p>All stories will be judged by our judges panel, as well as our special Guest Judge that many of you will recognize <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=":sq_clink:" class="tid_ico">. Stories will be judged on the following categories:</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><strong>Coherence</strong>:</p><p><em>How well-written and structured it is. A good story has to be coherent and be easy to read. Ideas should flow easily.<br>Good spelling and grammar are always important</em></p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><strong>Style</strong>:<br><em><br>How well narrated and interesting the story is. Keeping the reader interested and eager to keep reading is essential.</em></p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><strong>Creativity:</strong>:<br><em>How original and fun it is. A predictable and dull story is a boring story. Clich√©s and repetitiveness should be kept to<br>a minimum</em></p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><strong>Theme</strong>:</p><p><em>How well the story adheres to the round's theme. A story that does not adhere to the theme will be forfeiting these points.</em></p><p>Each category is worth 25 points. Points will be deducted if there are flaws on the story. At the end all points are added up for a story's total, for a maximum of 100. Furthermore, judges can add up to 15 points as a <strong>Judge's Bonus</strong> if they enjoyed a story particularly. The maximum is still 100 points.</p><p>This week's judges are <span class="tid_user tid_user_2276966 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="2276966">Alisette</span>, <span class="tid_user tid_user_4171359 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="4171359">lostalien</span> and myself, <span class="tid_user tid_user_1764107 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1764107">Colette</span>. Our week's Guest Judge is none other than <span class="tid_user tid_user_112128 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="112128">Annette</span>!</p><p><strong><br>Theme: </strong></p><p>To launch this round, the first week is <strong>Themeless</strong>. That is, you can post whatever you please. Just keep it D2N related please.</p><p>The deadline for this round is until Friday 22 after the attack.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><p>If you need clarification or help, or if you're interested in taking a judge's seat, please send me a Twinoid message. First come first serve <img src="../../../../gfx/square/wink.png" alt=":sq_clink:" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>Good luck to all, and happy writing!</p>

                <p>Sacrifice<br>Ya know, my old man always told me something.<br>‚ÄúEveryone has to make sacrifices, son. It‚Äôs not about what the sacrifice is, or how much of it you sacrifice. It‚Äôs about what you sacrifice it for.‚Äù<br>His words are something I‚Äôve yet to let myself give up on. Everything else, I‚Äôll give up. But I‚Äôll never let morality die. I‚Äôll never let my humanity die.</p><p>I‚Äôll never let myself get to their level.</p><p>I‚Äôve made mistakes. Lots of them. That‚Äôs an understatement. I‚Äôve made the biggest mistake of all time. I made the fuckup that‚Äôs the reason humanity is in the sorry state it is now. That‚Äôs a story for later. If I ever find another typewriter ribbon.</p><p>Today‚Ä¶ hellava day. Just got away from a settlement. There was‚Ä¶ 34 of us, I think. Fought ‚Äòem off good, really. We lasted a good month. Longer than anyone saw coming. One night, though‚Ä¶ We‚Äôd all worked so hard, pushed ourselves to the utmost limits. We were all so fucking drained‚Ä¶ None of us had the energy left to close the goddamned gates. Except me. They‚Äôd already gotten in. More of them were coming soon, it was inevitable. If they were shut then, it woulda been averted.</p><p>Nothing‚Äôs ever that simple, though. Not anymore.</p><p>Was a one-way trip. Anyone who got near those gates wasn‚Äôt coming back. A few of us had the strength left to move it. None of us had the balls. It was clear we weren‚Äôt gonna make it. I‚Äôd like to tell you this is the part where I manned up and closed them; or someone else did. Nope. Every fucking person in that settlement was devoured in minutes. Not yet, though‚Ä¶</p><p>See, I‚Äôd been following the attack patterns. There‚Äôs always a bird of prey flying above it. Like a crow. It was flying awful low. I thought I would just have one last actually tasty meal. With all the others. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôd chosen to instead catch that fucking maggoty bird. Shot it down with my ‚Äòtrusty sidearm‚Äô (Ain‚Äôt so fucking trusty when you only ever had one clip). I snuck around the side of the horde, keeping quiet. Everyone had called me a madman. But, I grabbed it. From underneath the wall. One maggoty, dirty crow.</p><p>Brought it back to the workshop, where we‚Äôd started holding up. Cooked it a little, just so it wouldn‚Äôt kill us then. Right as I was about to gut the poor thing, it sprung back to life‚Ä¶</p><p>Wasn‚Äôt natural, though. Even the rotters abide by the basic laws of nature, but not this bird. Tore apart half of us in seconds, faster than I could vomit. It was bloody, guts hanging everywhere After I‚Äôd done vomiting, the noise stopped. The zed just stood there, swaying slightly. Something wasn‚Äôt right. Roughly five of us sat there, staring in awe. The bird spoke, in a gravely, dark voice. That incited fear right away.<br>‚ÄúYou DArE ChaLLenGE ThE MIgHtY CCCCCCCCCCCROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWW???‚Äù<br>It was clear enough the thing was looking at me. I was only going to live a few more minutes, might as well take a gamble.<br>‚ÄúYes. I do challenge the ‚Äòmighty crow‚Äô,.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYOuR LIVeR LoOKs AWfuL TasTY, ToNIGht. WhhhhYYYYY sHOUldnT I JuST EaT iT? GeTTT OnN yOuR KnneeeeEEEeess ANd BEgggGGGG, ThEEEEn I mIGht JuST OnlY KiLl YoU OnCE‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>I wasn‚Äôt about to just let myself be bettered by a fucking bird. I can clear he was the eternity-of-torture kind, but frankly that‚Äôs what I deserve for causing the apocalypse. I leapt at him with all my strength.</p><p>In seconds, it grabbed hold of me and flew away into the sky at lightspeed. I saw the zombies start to devour my comrades for a splitsecond, and then-</p><p>Well, that‚Äôs actually about present day. I woke up in a cave full of anything valuable. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm in for a lifetime of torture, but it‚Äôs worth it. I sacrificed my eternal soul, to give the finger to whoever‚Äôs shitstirring this mess. It was worth it. I might have been chickenshit back at the town, but at least I got a chance to stand for what I believed in.</p>

                <p>Blood.</p><p>I can remember a time when we weren't used to it. A time when the sight of it would turn our stomachs sour. That was a long time ago, before we came to this settlement, before I became watchmen. It all started on July 11th the sun went down and the horde came out. We weren't ready... not yet... Too many people died because of our failure. The Arenas of Sweat they called it, don't ask me who came up with that stupid name. I'd imagine all that's left of it is chewed up bones and dust. I ran.. We ran... I can still remember his screams. James died to the horde that night. I heard his screams, I heard his bones snap like twigs, I even heard his blood flowing on the cold desert sands. You wanna know what I did? I ran. I ran like any sane person would. I suppose I'm not sane anymore, I've stopped running.</p><p><em>Bang.</em></p><p>I eventually found a new town, The Menacing Barrack of Irma. Another stupid name if you ask me, I've yet to meet anyone in town named Irma and anyone I ask has nothing to say. I'm a newcomer, fresh meat, they expected me to be dead before the night was over. I proved them wrong. When the horde came to the gates, I didn't run this time. I stood with a few other stoic survivors, watchmen they called themselves, when the gate shattered and the horde rushed in. We met them, A war cry in our throats and weapons in our hands. I was a new blood, the only weapon they were willing to spare to me was a human femur. I met the hordes charge all the same. <br>Skulls cracked and broke, blood slashed out from knife wounds, I even say two watchmen fighting with furniture! Furniture god damn it! Can you even imagine? I saw one lady smash a zed to pieces with a Beer Fridge! Poor bugger never even had a chance. After the dust settled and our blood cooled off we had to deal with the inevitable.. Our own casualties. We watered the ones we could. We tossed the rest. Huh? Whats that? Oh yes, back there to the left? Yes, that is the bone I used that night. I've used it on many watches, not failed me yet.</p><p><em>Bang.</em></p><p>Yes... Yes I do think it's getting louder... No, It's nothing to worry about. Anyways, where was I? Oh yes, those of us who survived the night went about our normal routines for the day before we tucked in for the night. One thing I don't think any of you ever understood about us was that yes, we defended you, we fight hard every night for your safety. We also busted our asses everyday making sure projects got done and that people who were stranded got saved.</p><p><em>Bang. Bang.</em></p><p>Now now, don't you worry yourselves about that, hush all of you. I'm sure its just my fellow watchmen erecting the last of our defenses for the night.</p><p><em>Bang. Bang. Bang.</em></p><p>You all need to understand what makes us different. We fight for your safety, not because of courage, not because of honor, but because each of us has a sin in our past that we must atone for. Mine? Mine.. was.. leaving James to die that day... I swore that if I survived the desert I'd never run again. I haven't, not to this day.</p><p><em>Bang. Bang. BANG. BANG.</em></p><p>Today though I did run... But I ran for you my fellow survivors. Here in a few minuets that doors going to open. Despite everything I told you, It will not be my fellow watchmen that enter. It'll be the source of all our nightmares. We noticed a steady rise in the zed population and we knew we couldn't fight them all, we knew tonight there would be to many.</p><p><em>Bang. BANG. BANG. BANG</em><br>.<br>Listen to me, this is very important! Hush! Quite now listen to me! Any second now that doors going to cave in, I'm going to charge them. I'm going to kill as many of those twisted parodies of life that I can. I'm going to clear a path for you. Head for the screaming saws, turn them off and head into the wasteland. I know it sounds insane! If you stay here you die, out there you have a chance.</p><p><em>BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG.</em></p><p>Get ready... It'll happen anytime now...</p><p><em>BANG.</em></p><p>The door came crashing in, and he didn't run, not away at the very least. He hit the foremost ranks of the horde with two water bombs instantly making a hole for all of us to get outside, In that moment a few of the citizens found the fire in their belly, the stood with him, they took weapons off the wall and charged the horde along side him. He fought the zeds back with his trusty bone urging us to leave them, to get out of town. We did, I could hear crunching bone as we ran... Then I heard the screams.. the first watchmen to die that night... I'd imagine he wasn't the last. We made it to the screaming saws and got out of the town. We survived, we made it to a new location, we built walls and we built homes. Most of all though we continued the one thing left to us from Irma.</p><p>The tradition of the watchmen. We stand for those who can't stand for themselves, we fight for those to tired from the days work who can't do it themselves, and we kill in the memory of those who saved our lives that night. My father was wrong about one thing, not all watchmen fight to forgive a sin. Me... You... All of us...</p><p>We fight for hope.</p>

                <p>Where am I? I thought to myself as I sit in this chair.<br>The chair its self was rickety and my scrumming didn‚Äôt help its case. There was molding flesh on the floor in front of me and it was green and a shade of violet. I looked up and saw that the shelter I was in was in deep repair. Planks hanging from the ceiling, floorboards ripped up from there places, the door was hanging on by a hinge, the walls all tattered with what looked like holes from something fired at great magnitude. Not much was left here; something was left on the stove in the kitchen. Looks like somebody was cooking something but never finished. The bathroom reeked and it was just a horrid smell of feces and urine. The shower curtains and the toilet was in shambles. There was a dead animal in the hallway, probably a cat or a small dog; either way it was dead. A hellhole was this place no doubts about it what interested me was how I myself was still alive. I could see a little bit out the window, a barren wasteland, rocks, dead bodies, completely lifeless and no sign of any life. I see weird beings flying through the sky, smashing thing on the ground. I could not call this life. It could be life there was no need as for it was a terrible sight in its self they didn‚Äôt even look human. Human, the thought crossed my mind at that moment. What happened to everyone and was I the only one left? Every possible thing went through my head. I had faint memories of what happened. I remembered that there were crashing sounds, things being knocked over, it wasn‚Äôt a person though, it was some type of‚Ä¶ of‚Ä¶ horrific monster. I couldn‚Äôt even say it was a monster it was far more terrifying. It gave me chills just thinking about it.</p><br><br><p>Just then a clutter of things fell outside this run-down shack, making a terrible ruckus. I heard many different shrieks it wasn‚Äôt even bearable sound. I was dazed couldn‚Äôt tell up from down, and left from my right. The scream was agonizing if I didn‚Äôt know any better, I could be deaf if I wasn‚Äôt already somewhat out of it. It was terrible I was just clutching my ears wondering what the hell was going on. Then, out of nowhere a vile being pushed in the door. Not even pushed in, launched the door across the room and the door disintegrated into a million splinters against the opposing wall. It was just a horrid thing, had green liquid dripping from its fangs. It had no eyes and two holes where the nose ‚Äúshould‚Äù have been. I really was hopping I could of remembered something from this but I was just panicked, everything was rushing, my heart, my thoughts, my sweat. Everything was just in a state of shock in the presence of this thing that looked like it came from hell. I thought to myself this is it. Not even a second to regain myself and not even a minute to figure out where exactly I was, nothing it all seem to end here. Something else rang out; I saw a spark from the window on the far side out of the corner of my eye. The being must have heard it and it had only inched its head to my right. Its head had then at that point exploded into mangled mess of blood and what appeared to be bits of the brain. Shades of green, red, and magenta came gushing out of its head and I became even sicker than before. I had lost control of my body functions and proceeded to puke all over it and the floor. It was the most retched feeling ever, my guts were churning and my brain began to gasp for air as for I was vomiting a lot. I looked up for a second and saw what looked to be a military man. He was dressed like one that is, he had the gear on and everything, the helmet, rucksack, what looked like to be an M4, and his night vision goggles on top of his helmet. He looked at me for a sec and then his eyes got huge. He then grew a huge grin on his face, just seeing him made me feel so much better. I then continued to puke on the floor after that thought though.</p><p>Here's mine I hope it counts</p>

                <p>Decrepid Pits. I remember that name. I will always remember that name.</p><p>Decrepid Pits was in a region far from here. You can't visit it now - by the time you read this, it's probably turned to ash and rubble, consumed by the ever-shifting sands.<br>When I first hauled myself through those gates, it was with two friends. But I don't know the other four people there now, standing, watching... waiting.</p><p>It was a Saturday... Perhaps a Sunday, when I first went through that gate. I should know - weekends never worked out for me in the end. As we crossed the boundary, we saw the frame of an abandoned outpost. Little more than a handful of deserted camp beds and a rickety shack with nothing in it. Over time, of course, more people arrived. We never checked them. We just... assumed... they would be fine to stay. We never checked their motives for coming, or why they left where they did to get here...</p><p>Day one. Usually one of the toughest days, it seems. Nobody knows what the plan is. Mainly because there isn't one - forty strangers walk into a fort, you don't get a magic slip of paper that unquestionably tells you what to do. There's always a level of debate, of uncertainty, the feeling that perhaps what you do right now, will determine the lives of everyone around you. And it does. More than you think.</p><p>We got through the first four days perfectly, or so it seemed. We lost one or two people here and there - in the apocalypse, it's inevitable. We stuck a plank in the ground, and moved on. You can't waste time thinking about the past. Ha. Can't think about the past, but you're still reading this, aren't you? And I'm still writing, because for now, I still have a story to tell.</p><p>After the fifth night, things started to skew a bit. The message boards were almost empty, conversation seemed to almost cease. What had been a busy town seemed to cough to a halt, the people moving lethargically from place to place, mechanically doing what they had to. I have no doubt that we could have survived. But one person had other ideas.</p><p>We may never know why he decided to do it. But he took his Watch position beside the gate, stood blindly out facing the oncoming horde. But did he prepare for impact? Not really. He was on their side. He was the Day Six doorman, letting them in for their evening meal.</p><p>We lost twenty two people that night. I still don't know how I survived. When the attack was over, we just headed straight to our homes, trying not to think about the massacre. When we woke the next day though, did we have a hell of a job clearing the streets. I'll never forget that sight.</p><p>We've managed to drag the wreck of a town we have through a few more days. I've lost track of how many days since we arrived for the first time... nine, ten, perhaps eleven? It won't be long now. Five people can't hold off the armies of the undead forever, and we're in the loop of their rotting, decaying gallows. It's only a matter of time before we're choked, left with nothing to defend ourselves with but our bare hands against the flood of corpses.</p><p>So here I am now, rattling on. Writing my tale, telling my story to the next generation who decide to settle here. We weren't so lucky, what makes you think you are? You're in the same boat as us... ultimate destruction, just a few kilometers away. It's never far. But if you are set on surviving here, remember this: Nobody has ever seen it except me. That little flicker of black in the sky after the attack ends. I swear that... thing... sweeps it's eye over the carnage when we're done. Every day, it drops a paper, and leaves. Maybe fi you can find out where it comes from, you can survive.</p><p>But you don't look so special to me. You look like the same people who are out there now, staring out into the wastelands. Good intentions, bad implementation.</p><p>For now, I'm just hiding here. They can't force me out of my house. I'm going to watch them die the same way I saw everyone else go. And when they have - I'll take all I want from here. It's not the laborer who reaps the rewards - it's the person who can hold their home longest.</p><p>I think I can. Can you? I'd like to see you try...</p>

                <p><strong>The King of Nowhere</strong></p><p>There in the dark shadows of the small decayed room sat a rather well dressed man who sat in an old wooden rocking chair. His face was illuminated in the darkness by the small tender flame on the end of his fine Cuban cigar as he rocked back and forth staring out through a gap the wall that served at a window. His face was smooth as a baby's bottom and his eyes twinkled a devilish charm. The man's name was Styles Moely, but people around here call him Sly. The man was smart, strong, and charming. That's why they made him king.</p><p><em>"King of Nowhere," He humorously mumbled to himself. It was true that his kingdom was in a rather isolated spot. The wasteland spread out forever in all direction and even the best scout they had available couldn't find civilization for miles. Alive civilization, that is. There were plenty of sand eroded and forgotten structures that had remained inhabited throughout the years, but though the inhabitants wore the skin of the previous occupants, they weren't the same. The things that removed them and took their identity were not human, let alone an animal. They were feral, hungry, and most of all, dead.</em></p><p>Sly had wound himself up in this small little town that had been protecting itself from both the sands and undead for years. The large wall that held out against these forces was built with a mix-match of wooden, metal, and whatever else was laying around, just like the town buildings themselves. The original townspeople were welcoming and kind; that would be their downfall. Soon, as tired survivors marching along the sandy wasteland began stumbling upon their shelter, the town grew and grew until they were forty strong. Then, like a switch, the town sealed the gates and refused to have anymore survivors enter. Supplies ran low and what housing space they had room for was damp, cramped, and poorly lamped. That's when Sly stepped forth, with many people behind him, to calm the situation. The citizens adored him for his charming features, wise words, and GETTING IT DONENESS (a popular phrase spoken by Mayor Fasi's followers). He gave speeches, blamed others, created mobs, killed a few good citizens, but in the end, he'd made them happy. They trusted him now. They trusted him completely.</p><p><em>"They trusted me too much," said Sly with a painful sadness as he sat up and walked to the window. He gazed out from the watchtower penthouse he had spent his glory days in and looked around at his little kingdom. He looked down and spotted the town homes and the groups of people walking about the streets. Sly cleared his dry throat and roared with his strong, booming voice, "Citizens! Come gather around the tower! I wish to.. to tell you how deeply sorry I am." Though the desert wind blew howling mad, the citizens heard and began making their way to the base of the tower. "I have betrayed you. I tricked you, played tricks on your mind. I gave you words of comfort and strength to lure you into a false state of safety." Sly's eyes began to water as the citizens came closer. "A man can kill, rob, and rape, but I find lying to be the hardest sin to bear of all. I-I... I am truly sorry." </em></p><p>Sly began to cry as his cigar trembled from his lip and down to the crowd below. The tower was beginning to sway as the citizens beat their fists upon the coarse wooden base, but they were not fists of anger, dear reader, they were fists of hunger. The townsfolk had been brutally butchered and slain by the night's attack before joining the ranks of the enemy themselves. They had no warning despite the fact Sly knew that the defenses would not hold. He knew he had the power to alert everyone, but he instead chose to give them a last shed of comfort by telling them soft lies and hiding the coming storm behind his words. Sly leaned further out the window as he continued to sob, his salty tears plummeting softly down on the horde bellow, causing small sizzles and pops on their diseased flesh. He was leaning half way out the window before speaking, with suppressed sobs, to himself, "I was a drifter and now I have become the King of Nowhere." He balanced his gut on the window as the tower creaked. "Long live the king, you cheating lying bastard."</p><p><em>And with that, whether coincidence or fate, the wall snapped from the rotting room and Sly slipped out as he and the debris came crashing down. Sly didn't die immediately as he smacked hard into sandy ground. No, he laid there, disoriented as the town surrounded him in a putrid circle of fleshy arms and bared teeth. They ate him, bit by bit, as he succumbed to the violent wounds. In the darkness of night, a small glint sparked on a nearby rooftop, and with a flutter of black feathers, a large bird soared into the moonlight sky to give a nasty caw. Within minutes, the dark speck disappeared in the sky as the grueling sound of snapped bones and tearing flesh echoed the dunes for miles, past the abandoned structures and much beyond where the scout had daringly explored. The King of Nowhere was dead.</em></p>

His face was illuminated in the darkness by the small tender flame on the end of his fine Cuban cigar as he rocked back and forth staring out through a gap the wall that served at a window. His face was smooth as a baby's bottom and his eyes twinkled a devilish charm. The man's name was Styles Moely, but people around here call him Sly. The man was smart, strong, and charming. That's why they made him king.</p><em>"King of Nowhere," He humorously mumbled to himself. It was true that his kingdom was in a rather isolated spot. The wasteland spread out forever in all direction and even the best scout they had available couldn't find civilization for miles. Alive civilization, that is. There were plenty of sand eroded and forgotten structures that had remained inhabited throughout the years, but though the inhabitants wore the skin of the previous occupants, they weren't the same. The things that removed them and took their identity were not human, let alone an animal. They were feral, hungry, and most of all, dead.</em><p>Sly had wound himself up in this small little town that had been protecting itself from both the sands and undead for years. The large wall that held out against these forces was built with a mix-match of wooden, metal, and whatever else was laying around, just like the town buildings themselves. The original townspeople were welcoming and kind; that would be their downfall. Soon, as tired survivors marching along the sandy wasteland began stumbling upon their shelter, the town grew and grew until they were forty strong. Then, like a switch, the town sealed the gates and refused to have anymore survivors enter. Supplies ran low and what housing space they had room for was damp, cramped, and poorly lamped. That's when Sly stepped forth, with many people behind him, to calm the situation. The citizens adored him for his charming features, wise words, and GETTING IT DONENESS (a popular phrase spoken by Mayor Fasi's followers). He gave speeches, blamed others, created mobs, killed a few good citizens, but in the end, he'd made them happy. They trusted him now. They trusted him completely.</p><em>"They trusted me too much," said Sly with a painful sadness as he sat up and walked to the window. He gazed out from the watchtower penthouse he had spent his glory days in and looked around at his little kingdom. He looked down and spotted the town homes and the groups of people walking about the streets. Sly cleared his dry throat and roared with his strong, booming voice, "Citizens! Come gather around the tower! I wish to.. to tell you how deeply sorry I am." Though the desert wind blew howling mad, the citizens heard and began making their way to the base of the tower. "I have betrayed you. I tricked you, played tricks on your mind. I gave you words of comfort and strength to lure you into a false state of safety." Sly's eyes began to water as the citizens came closer. "A man can kill, rob, and rape, but I find lying to be the hardest sin to bear of all. I-I... I am truly sorry." </em><p>Sly began to cry as his cigar trembled from his lip and down to the crowd below. The tower was beginning to sway as the citizens beat their fists upon the coarse wooden base, but they were not fists of anger, dear reader, they were fists of hunger. The townsfolk had been brutally butchered and slain by the night's attack before joining the ranks of the enemy themselves. They had no warning despite the fact Sly knew that the defenses would not hold. He knew he had the power to alert everyone, but he instead chose to give them a last shed of comfort by telling them soft lies and hiding the coming storm behind his words. Sly leaned further out the window as he continued to sob, his salty tears plummeting softly down on the horde bellow, causing small sizzles and pops on their diseased flesh. He was leaning half way out the window before speaking, with suppressed sobs, to himself, "I was a drifter and now I have become the King of Nowhere." He balanced his gut on the window as the tower creaked. "Long live the king, you cheating lying bastard."</p><em>And with that, whether coincidence or fate, the wall snapped from the rotting room and Sly slipped out as he and the debris came crashing down. Sly didn't die immediately as he smacked hard into sandy ground. No, he laid there, disoriented as the town surrounded him in a putrid circle of fleshy arms and bared teeth. They ate him, bit by bit, as he succumbed to the violent wounds. In the darkness of night, a small glint sparked on a nearby rooftop, and with a flutter of black feathers, a large bird soared into the moonlight sky to give a nasty caw. Within minutes, the dark speck disappeared in the sky as the grueling sound of snapped bones and tearing flesh echoed the dunes for miles, past the abandoned structures and much beyond where the scout had daringly explored. The King of Nowhere was dead.</em></cite><br><p>Woah...I admit it gave me feels.Nice one Costumed One...<span class="tid_sideNote">nice one...<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_ranger.gif" alt=":hordes_eclair:" class="tid_ico"></span></p>

                <p><strong>Pain</strong></p><p><em>Are you going to die? HAH! Death doesn't exist. Sure you'll "die", but you don't really "die" die. Some people believe that death does however. That "final escaping place", that "ending suffering", that "true happiness". Do I believe? HAH! That's a difficult question to answer. I'd guess I'd have to say I don't believe, but I sure HOPE to hell that it does. Life... Life is shit. It doesn't matter what you do, you WILL feel it. We all do, that thing, that PAIN... Pain... Why? Why does it burden us. Life would be easy without pain. Some people say the pain doesn't affect them any more, that they have built a resistance. HAH! Sure they can tolerate it longer than the others but they all succumb to it in the end. Pain is inescapable, it consumes us all eventually. The only way out is death. But death does not exist. You know, HAHAHA, the thought hadn't even crossed my mind before that man. The Man. But he was hardly a man at all. What kind of man kills without reason, steals without cause, and runs off to greet false death's embrace? SHUT UP AN SIT DOWN! HAHAHA, because you see. It got me wondering. Why would anyone do that. And then there was more men. Harbingers of grief, traitors of humanity, doormmen of pain. There were so many, stealing, murdering, they all did such unthinkable things, and for no reason anyone could understand. HAH! People would say they went insane, that they were just plain evil. No, that wasn't it. Their eyes. I could see it in their eyes. They knew something. But what? Why? And then I heard it. That blast. As soon as I heard that blast I knew my answer was imminent, I ran, ran toward that blast that others were cowering from. The blast came from a tent, but when I reached for the tent flap some THING flew out and attacked me. It screeched the most painful sound, and slashed my face up with its most painful claws. And then it was gone. Where, I don't know, but what I do know I'll tell you now, so stop your squirming and listen closely. Do you know what I saw in that tent? HAH! I saw a dead man. But not just a dead man... A DEAD dead man. I knew it as soon as I saw him, looking into those eyes... There was no life left in him and there never would be again. I wondered who he was, and how that lucky bastard escaped this, I knew it had to do with the thing that attacked me before, but how? And how could I do it. How could I escape? Others approached cautiously, all unknowing of what wonder they were witnessing. One man walked up and spat on the dead dead man. I remember his words well, ‚ÄúThis here was Cornealeos, a bastard known for his violent acts. It seems his actions caught up with him‚Äù. Everything fell into place. Life is pain. Therefore by enduring this pain you are living life, but the only way to end life is to create pain. HAHAHA! And so I began plotting. How was I going to create enough pain to die? I could follow in the others footsteps, stealing and murdering. But their actions were recoverable. They aimed too high, and their attacks were too spread out. No, HAHAHA, you have to hit small and hit hard. The first was this cute little girl. I crawled into her tent one night and bashed her over the head. She went out like a light, HAHAHA. Then I dragged her back here, where you sit so patiently now, HAHA, and I started on her toes. She awoke at once, shrieking like a banshee. HAHAHAHA, much like you will. But little good it did her and little good it will do you. Once I had her toes I mover up to her nose. I used this to pull it off. Then it was her ears. HAHA, oh how she struggled when I started cutting them up! Next was just a beating. Just a continuous beat you know. Thunk Thunk Thunk Thunk Thunk Thunk Thunk‚Ä¶ She passed out after only ten minutes. I woke her back up by removing her tongue. I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing back then. I was careless. She died after an hour. HAHAHA, but I‚Äôve been getting better. That kid lasted bout 3, then his brother 5. HAH! Last one lasted 3 days. I wonder how long you will? But don‚Äôt worry, you won‚Äôt die. You‚Äôll wish death upon yourself, but you and I both know death doesn‚Äôt exist.</em></p>

                <p><strong>The deep discussion</strong></p><p><em>A surprisingly calm evening. It was half an hour till the usual attack. Fred, also called scrapster, was sitting at the gates waiting. He was one of the watchmen ordered to keep the gates in check. He knew there was one more, but who? That he didn`t know. Suddenly he heard steps coming towards him. He picked his cricket bat and shouted out.</em></p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Whose there!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You should know better. Clean your eyes.</p><p><em>It was Randy, a guardian. He was considerably bigger than Fred, almost 10 inches taller, and he carried an even larger shield with him. Fred turned little bit red from shame. </em></p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Should have known you were gonna be the second watchman today.</p><p><strong>Randy:</strong> yup, you should have. I see your well equipped for today. Though maybe one water gun would not hurt...</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Nah, didn`t save my water ration today. I think we are fine, what, with you having 2 of these bats with you.</p><p><strong>Randy:</strong> Well, you know, don`t wanna risk dying.</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Yeah, yeah...</p><p><em>A little bit awkward silence filled the air. It was pretty boring, but still somehow scary. Suddenly, Randy opened his mouth.</em></p><p><strong>Randy:</strong> Do you ever wonder how we ended up getting this screwed? With all of these zombies?</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Beats me. I know, that the shaman has a theory about that. Two in fact. One of them includes an intense nuclear war...</p><p><strong>Randy:</strong> That feels a little bit stupid. Like some stupid movie or a kids show.</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Well, it is kinda nicer than his other theory.</p><p><strong>Randy:</strong> Spit it out. In this place, there is no real need to be "Nice."</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> We are apparently in hell. Like in Dantes Inferno.</p><p><strong>Randy:</strong> He really jumped into the worst possible thing didn`t he.</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Yup, but there is some sense in it atleast.</p><p><strong>Randy:</strong> Like what?</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Well, In dantes inferno, the hell has different levels. everyone is worse than the other, and the devil watches over every single one of them.</p><p><strong>Randy:</strong> And, if I may ask, who is the devil?</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> According to the shaman, the crows.</p><p><strong>randy:</strong> *Pfft* I know they are scary at this time of the day, but seriously? A black bird is the devil? He has been smoking a bit too much.</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Well, the stages of hell are all here.</p><p><strong>Randy:</strong> tell me. Shamans drugged up stories are always the best.</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Well the first level is us. Here in this town. Apparently, even if we die, we will just resurrect. Basicly, our punishment, is to live in this world, without a shred of hope to survival, but we can still enjoy the life the best we can with alcohol and other people.</p><p><strong>Randy:</strong> Come on. That could never be true.</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> The second level is the animals in the desert. They can do NOTHING, but wait for their imminent destruction, either by us or the zombies.</p><p><strong>Randy:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Fred</strong>: The third level is the zombies. They have no hope of ever being human again. They always feel pain, they always hunger for the flesh of those who have survived better than them, and never stop. They, as you could call them, are abandoned by the god.</p><p><strong>randy:</strong> Okay, stop that. I know that that must be a lie! There is no wa...</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Do you remember where you came from? How you ended up here? How we all are wearing the same clothes? It must be someones doing.</p><p><strong>Randy:</strong> A mere citizen shouldn`t kno...</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Don`t you remember? The shaman told me this theory. If it is true, there might be even a heaven, and after suffering here, we might go there.</p><p><strong>Randy:</strong> But what if there isn`t?</p><p><em>Suddenly, a huge growling noise filled the air. They were coming, and very fast.</em></p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Okay, now just get ready. You`re the stronger one here so...</p><p><strong>Randy:</strong> Dangit all...</p><p><em>That night, everyone survived under the crows watchful eye.</em></p>

                <p>"Infection. Little 'i' as apposed to big 'I'. We all know about The Infection. The walking corpses outside our gates, those animated cadavers that think of nothing but grinding our flesh between their teeth. We all know about that Infection. We all know how to try and avoid it. Don't get bit, don't get overwhelmed outside the gates, and most of all pray they don't choose your home that night. We know how to deal with that Infection."</p><p>"But there is a hidden killer here in these dusty town steads. Infections. Rampaging bacteria that overwhelm the last of your bodies defenses. They get into your body and tears it down from within. We've regressed so far. Modern Medicine can knock out an infection with one pill. Paracetiod, a wonder drug. One of those babies and you feel brand knew. You might even be able to forget about this hell we live in... For a time."</p><p>The man speaking paused. He knew he was giving the poor wretches false hope. He had to though, he had to make them willing to take the drugs. Even if they had no chance of saving them.</p><p>"Unfortunately Paracetiod is rare, very rare, and without out it... your chances are slim. From our estimates you have a seventy-five percent chance to die in this hell we call home. There are few options for those with an infection. Worse still... If you fall to this infection. We have to deal with you as a member of the other Infection."</p><p>"That's why we've locked you in old man Jenkins' house. One way or another you all have an infection. We've locked you in here because we have no more Paracetiod, no more wonder drug, and very little options left to us."</p><p>He stopped again and observed his 'patients'. He could see the terror in their eyes now, he'd just pulled their high hopes right out from under them. He told them there was a cure then he slapped them across the face with the knowledge that they didn't have it. Now they understand why they are here. Now they know why we had to cage them away like animals. At least they think they understand.</p><p>"The town has provided us with some unmarked medical products. Five of them, one for each of you. We have no guarantee this will work but it is worth a shot. We also have one other... option. This my friends is Cyanide. Will put you lights out seconds after you take it, once your dead we can deal with you body and guarantee you want harm our former neighbors. We have two of them." Another lie, the man thought, but one that needed to be told. "Any takers? No? Not yet? Alright lets start experimenting then shall we?"<br>The man dropped one package of unlabeled drugs into the room, the infected residents played a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors to see who would go first. A woman won. The man couldn't remember her name. Probably for the best that way. She took the pill and washed it down with her water ration. She waited a moment before she began to shake her head. She told her fellows that she didn't feel like it did anything. It didn't do anything at all. She broke down crying and sat in a corner of the room. The next man seeing that the girls result elected to take one of the cyanide tablets. He did. He stopped breathing before his body even hit the ground.<br> <br>The next two men were brothers and asked if they could go at the same time. The man behind the glass obliged them and dropped two more unlabeled drugs into the room. Both of the men felt an effect but found it hard to tell if they had been cured. One broke down. screaming at his shadow trying to hide from everyone's eyes, trying to hide his eyes, to hide the terror written there. The other brother became hooked. It was easy to see, he was hyper, alert, and asking if he could have more. He became agitated when told that no more would be provided to him.</p><p>The last subject, a woman, chose to take the last cyanide. Seeing the man catatonic with fear had broken her will. Now she only wanted to end it all. So she did. The pill went down then she did as well. The man behind the glass turned to the mayor with a weary smile.</p><p>"Experiment complete." The mayors eyes grew wide as he saw Watchmen enter the room and kill off the poor wretches who had survived the ordeal.</p><p>"None of them were infected were they?" The man smiled. "You'll sleep better not knowing Mayor. Just know that I found out what you wanted, we now know some of the effects of these drugs." The Mayor nodded and left slowly. The man looked at he corpses of the people he had just murdered. There was no excuse. That's what he had done. Not a single one of them had been infected. None of them.</p><p>With that last thought the man took out the third cyanide tablet. The one he had hidden away for himself. His last thought was of the infection raging in his body, the one he had hoped to cure with this experiment. Well he found a cure alright he thought. The only cure is death. With that he took the tablet and cured himself forever.</p>

                <p><strong><em>The Fat Cats Mother.</em></strong></p><p><strong>The sun shines into the open end of the lean-to she has come to call home. However, on this specific morning she is not there. Her mattress still cold and it's purpose unfulfilled since the night before last. The girl that inhabits it was to busy to sleep. She only just made it back to town, with the man on her back, before the undead descended upon the town to commence their nightly attack. The undead mob profiting from the fear the darkness multiplies in the hearts of the residing townsfolk. They managed to hold the hordes back last night though, fighting back against their inevitable extinction.<br><br>This town, if you could call it that, was still young, many of the people here have only been so for a couple of days. Most of them had been in another small town and had fled when it's walls crumbled and the townspeople plunged into chaos against a formidable terror. Those that were lucky to get out alive were left to wander the wasteland, those that were luckier still; stumbled across another town in it's beginnings, a desperate attempt to recreate what they had before all of this, an attempt to recreate some sort of order in the midst of a world in pain. Those that were less naive understood that this was not possible now, all they seek is a temporary safe haven from the marauding undead. The end was coming to the human race, everybody could sense it now. The girl understood this and vowed to live as long as she could, even if it meant she was the last of her kind on the planet. She will show she is made of sterner stuff, she will show them why her kind have ruled this earth for however many thousands of years they have done. She will live. At least, that's what she told herself at night, when she tried to distract herself from the screams and piercing shrills.<br><br>She knew the cell would be hard on the man, after all, her hands had helped build it. Nothing but bare concrete. Concrete walls, floor and ceiling. The only thing that softened the eye at all was the old battered mattress, stained black with old spilt blood and only a few inches thick. Presumably, the filling had been taken by the other townsfolk to in turn soften their own. It couldn't possibly make the man's stay any more comfortable. Many of the cells previous inhabitants had actually chosen the hard, cold floor instead of the sad mistake for a bed, claiming it was cursed and the source of their horrific nightmares. The towns people could hear them at night screaming and crying. Their fate was that of true despair and horror. Poor bastards. What a way to die.<br><br>That's his fate now. He's got a few more hours, maybe a day max. I had to do it! He'd be a liability out here with the rest of us. Never knowing when he could turn. I had to do. Think of the damage he could do if he was loose. He looks like shit. Perhaps I should get him some water, before his body rejects it completely. Would it be a waste? We need every drop we can get for the able bodied. No... He needs some water. Without humanity all would already be lost. I have to do it.<br><br>The flakes of skin that made up what was left of the man's lips were dry grey and barely clung to his face at all. For the past few hours he had been waving in and out of consciousness; awakening only long enough to feel the intense sting in his hand and the cold burn of sweat against his skin. His attention diverts to the door of his holding and his eyes focus only for a second on the small confident figure shaded by the unusually bright sunlight behind it. The girl had brought a packet of crisps as well as a flask of water. She leans the man slightly up against the cold wall behind him and pours a little of the water into the mouth in need. A little cough and splutter but it goes down smoothly in the end and soon enough the entire contents had disappeared. Regaining a little strength the man manages to let out a short gasp that the girl understands to be gratitude. 'I brought a little food...' before she can even finish her sentence she notices the man has passed out. Unconsciousness: eternal bliss compared to his living hell.<br><br>The girl notices a heavy exhalation and pauses in anticipation, waiting for the man's chest to rise again to mark his continuance. But it doesn't come. After examining the empty flask still in her hand, she holds it above her head and lets the last few drops fall onto her tongue. It wasn't a complete waste. At least the man's last experience was that of compassion. Standing a few paces away from the inanimate body she remembers the serrated knife she pocketed on the way here. 'I have to do it.' She mutters as she locks the cell door; just in case.<br></strong></p>

                <p>Sorry it's so long... Damn thing just wouldn't end, kept stretching on and on...</p><p><strong>Someone poisoned the water hole</strong><br><em>‚ÄúWhat the fuck man! What the fuck is wrong with you!‚Äù<br>‚ÄúHey hey! It wasn‚Äôt my fault!‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOf course it was your fuckin fault!‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo, the damn thing just jumped right in!‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYah, I fuckin saw the fuckin thing jump in you fuckin idiot!‚Äù<br>‚ÄúCalm the hell down! Maybe it missed‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMISSED! MISSED! IT CAN‚ÄôT POSSIBLY MISS!‚Äù Another joined the two men at the well. <br>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on you two?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôl tell yah what the fu-‚Äú<br>‚ÄúShut up Frank! You can‚Äôt say a single freakin sentence without my ears bleedin. So Barnie, what‚Äôs happened?‚Äù Barnie took a step back, eyes on the verge of tears. Before him stood his hero; and how was he supposed to tell the hero in front of him, who stood up for him whenever he failed, who helped him whenever he hurt, who believed in him when no one else did, that he had failed once again. He had screwed up, but this was serious; he hadn‚Äôt just lost his water ration, or knocked over a construction, or got himself trapped‚Ä¶ No, he had royally effed up. And after all that the shining knight that stood before him had done, poured out all his faith, all his effort into Barnie, encouraging him that he could change, be less clumsy, be a hero, Barnie was still the same old screw up.<br>‚ÄúW-w-well you s-see Harry‚Ä¶ I was on the w-watch like you said I sh-sh-should‚Ä¶ And, well, I was s-sent with F-F-Fraank‚Ä¶ W-w-wee ha-haa-‚Äú Harry put his hand on Barnie‚Äôs shoulder. His eyes stared into Barnie‚Äôs easing his panic. They were a soft blue, and held the shine of an uncut diamond.<br>‚ÄúCalm down Barnie. It‚Äôs ok. Just tell me what happened‚Äù. His voice lulled the icy fear out of Barnie‚Äôs throat. His mind cleared. Barnie looked deeply into the blueness of Harry‚Äôs eyes.<br>‚ÄúI missed a zed Harry. It got in and got away. I chased it here with Frank, but the thing was quick Harry. I never saw one so fast before, you have to believe me Harry! It was like it was on a mission Harry, it weaved between all the tents, ignoring everyone, me and Frank, we lost it twice-‚Äú<br>‚ÄúYOU lost it you scatter brained-‚Äú<br>‚ÄúShut up Frank. Let him finish‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ It just kept running farther and farther into town, and then it jumped in‚Ä¶ It jumped in here‚Äù Barnie‚Äôs voice broke at his last statement; he pointed shakily at the little well that the citizen had dug along time ago. They had been rationing 1 drink a day for the past month, and it seemed like they still had a month before the well supply grew worrisome. Harry bent over and looked down the well-hole. His teeth could be heard grinding together as he thought. Frank glared at Barnie in disgust. Harry turned and left without another word. Barnie watched in horror, filled with guilt and despair. <br>‚ÄúThis is all your fault you little shit. I told you you couldn‚Äôt handle it. I told you you would fuck up. That‚Äôs all you ever do Barnie. And you fucked us all this time‚Äù. Frank stared hatefully into Barnie‚Äôs tear-streaking eyes, and then too turned and left. Barnie stood beside the well, crying. That‚Äôs all he could do, cry. That‚Äôs all he was ever good at.<br><br>‚ÄúListen up everyone! This is important!‚Äù General stood in front of the well, his dark leathery skin crackling in the heat of the morning sun. A rather unhappy mob of thirsty people had formed around the well. Water was one of the only comforts anyone could ask for in this wasteland, and no one was pleased that this rarity was being postponed. ‚ÄúListen everyone listen! You must all calm down. Wait until everyone is here, I will only say this once, and I expect you all to hear my every word‚Äù. General often started his ‚Äúspeeches‚Äù with, ‚Äòlisten to me people‚Äô and ‚ÄòI‚Äôm only going to say this once‚Äô. He hated repeating himself, and his temper was re-knownly avoided; but perhaps it was from that same fear that he was unspokenly elected as their commander. No one questioned him and no one disobeyed him, he would discuss all his plans with a small group of townsfolk, but beyond that he had absolute reign. Fear trumped all, and he was feared more than all. And so the mob quieted and patiently awaited his orders. Bit by bit drowsy and confused townsfolk shambled out of their tents and toward the well. Soon everyone was waiting in the mass, staring hungrily at General. When he was sure that everyone had accumulated in at the well, he spoke: ‚ÄúGood morning everyone. I hope you slept well. I have some troubling news to give you today, but before I do I want you all to know that I will do everything in my power to find a solution. I also want you to know that this is no-ones fault! We will NOT be having a witch-hunt, we will NOT be having a hanging. What happened last night was merely a case of bad luck.‚Äù The mass quivered nervously. ‚ÄúLast night the zed broke through! Shhh, do not worry, no one was injured. Only one made it into town, but this one zed hit us hard. It made it right here, to the well, and jumped in.‚Äù The mass jolted. People began whispering frantically, muttering paranoid fears under their breaths. Barnie was among them. He stood with them, not saying a word, he just put his head down and cried. ‚ÄúSo, comrades, we all know what happens when you ingest the disease that plagues corpses. You become one. And so, until further notice, the well will be off limits. So please, everyone should continue with their duties as normal, I assure you we will have this crisis fixed soon. But first, could‚Ä¶‚Äù General called out his council, ordering them to speak with him after everyone had dispersed. Barnie was not among them, and soon followed the crowd away, back to his daily duties. He felt no relief that General had blamed bad luck, in fact he felt worse. He knew that he was being protected by General‚Äôs equivocation, knowing that the town may thirst for blood when it‚Äôs thirst for water grew unbearable.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Part 2</strong><br><em>The day was done, the sun down and the sky black. Barnie sat upright in his bed, staring blankly at the starless sky. His head throbbed in pain, and his body ached in exhaust. He was thirsty. Everyone was, and it was all his fault. How long would this go on, General promised to fix it but how? The only thing people feared more than General was infection. Death was mercy compared to General‚Äôs public punishments, but infection was the most frightening experience anyone could imagine. Death with no release, the body bound back to life, burdened with intense anguish, burning hunger filled thoughts... The infection fear had spread across the town, plaguing sleep with nightmares of re-animation. Barnie had had his fair share of nightmares, but the worst by far where always ones where he re-animated. He would shamble about and slaughter everyone he knew, watch their pain, the pain which he was causing, burst out in blood. He would rip them all to pieces and then sit up screaming in the night, joined by others sharing similar nightmares. Everyone had witnessed the infection first hand, their mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, cousins, nephews, aunts, uncles, friends, acquaintances, hero‚Äôs, enemies, everyone! Everyone everyone had known had become infected, and to see such a transformation; staring into your mother‚Äôs eyes and glimpse a portion of pain she felt‚Ä¶ It was too awful for the mind to handle. No one would touch that water. And soon people would need it. The heat was too much to go for more than two days without water, how would General do it? How would General save everyone? He had saved the town hundreds of times before, he truly was a genius, but what if he couldn‚Äôt this time.<br>‚ÄúAnd it would be all my fault‚Äù, Bernie said silently under his breath. He began to sob before the darkness of the night sky overwhelmed him and he faded away‚Ä¶<br><br>Days past and the well remained untouched. General ordered the emergency reserves to be used, using chunky water found from a nearby pre-Z water purification facility. They had tried for days to get it working again when they first found it, but it was deemed far beyond damaged beyond repair. Fortunately it had a stockpile of weak water tablets, which could make the water soft enough to slide to slide down your throat, and had gallons of mucky ‚Äúwater‚Äù in rank tanks. But how long could it support forty people? The General continued every morning to ensure everyone that the issue was being solved, but rumors quickly spread. Drinking vile water every day can make a man mad, and many of the men around town had become violent. Paranoia grew in the hearts of the townsfolk, and tools and weapons from the bank began to disappear. Barnie spent most of his time working, no one spoke to him, no one accused him‚Ä¶ Except Frank, who was subtle about it, glaring menacingly at Barnie while he worked, stalking him about at night. And soon new rumors spread, about how Frank knew something. A little whisper here about how Frank was on duty that night, and a little whisper there about how Frank had been seen chasing something that night. It‚Äôs funny how word spreads, ideas form in one man‚Äôs head, and they spread to another‚Äôs, and then they jump again, and again, until everyone has the idea.<br><br>‚ÄúWakie wakie Barnie‚Äù<br>‚ÄúEr.. wha? Frank?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSh sh sh sh sh shhhh‚Ä¶ Quite now little fucker. You make another noise and I‚Äôl plunge this into your skull.‚Äù Barnie felt a sharp metallic point jab him in the forehead. He opened his eyes to see Frank‚Äôs nose only an inch away from his. Frank was sitting on his chest, pinning him to the ground. He had one hand smothering Barnie‚Äôs mouth, and another jabbing a knife into his forehead. Barnie began to cry fearfully. ‚ÄúHow is it that you have enough water in you to cry so often little fucker? Hmm‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre always crying, I swear you‚Äôve wept out more water than I‚Äôve ever drankin, hmm. So, you holdin out on me? You got some water hidden away? You planned this didn‚Äôt you? Hmmm‚Ä¶ Yah, that‚Äôs right isn‚Äôt it, you wanted us to dry up, you let that zed in, let it get to the well. Didn‚Äôt you. Bet you stole a gallon or two of water before. Don‚Äôt try to hide it, I see it in your eyes. You little fuck, you‚Äôre trying to kill us? Hah, well little fuck, you can‚Äôt kill me. Tell me where you hid it!‚Äù. Barnie looked past Frank into the night sky. He tried to say something but Frank‚Äôs hand muffled his words. ‚ÄúOh, you want to talk now, now that little fuck doesn‚Äôt have big fuck to protect him.‚Äù A dark silhouette smashed into Frank‚Äôs skull, knocking him off Barnie. Someone jumped onto Frank and began beating him across the head. Barnie crawled away hurriedly. What the hell was going on, who was that, what was happening. Barnie continued to cry, great globs of tears slid across his cheeks. The man stopped beating Frank and stood up, in the darkness of night it was impossible to tell who it was.<br>‚ÄúGo back to sleep Barnie, your safe now‚Äù. Harry‚Äôs voice.<br>‚ÄúHarry?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYes‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIs this my fault‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo Barnie, it‚Äôs mine‚Äù, Harry turned and left.<br>General announced that morning that Frank had been killed. The mass gathered in front of the well shook. Screams of protest erupted from them, General stood watching, as they grew excited. It was only a matter of time before his fear was not enough. He explained how Frank had tried to kill someone, and how a third party had arrived and rescued the victim. He left out Barnie‚Äôs and Harry‚Äôs names, perhaps again out of fear of an upcoming riot. The people were tired of the wretched water they were drinking, they were tired of General‚Äôs speeches, but most of all they were tired of their boring, labour-filled lives.<br><br><br></em></p>

                <p><strong>Part 3</strong><br><em>‚ÄúHey Barnie boy‚Äù<br>‚ÄúEr, wha, Frank‚Äù<br>‚ÄúFrank? You hear that boys, he lookin for Frank‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhat a laugh‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI knew it‚Äù<br>Bu-u-wha? Who‚Ä¶ Wha-‚Äú Barnie opened his eyes, feeling a powerful feeling of Deja-Vu. Sitting on his chest was a man he knew, but did not know, pointing something into his forehead. Around him huddled seven figures.<br>‚ÄúFrank told us the night before he died that he gunna get ‚Äòimself some real water. Hmmm. We all knew he was there that night, yah, and after a little lookin we find that he came here that other night. Night he died he payed you a visit. So that must meen you killed him, yah. You did didn‚Äôt yoooo Barnie boy. Hah, so where is it? Where‚Äôd you put the water?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any water guys. Frank was mad caus-‚Äú The man crammed the point into Barnie‚Äôs arm.<br>‚ÄúNo shit Barnie, Mr Fuckin Frank hated you like no one else, but we KNOW you have water, so fork it up buddy.‚Äù Barnie cried silently, unable to speak. He began choking, quickly being muffled by a large grimy hand. <br>‚ÄúWhat do you guys think you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù Harry, again. Always Harry running to Barnie‚Äôs rescue. Barnie‚Äôs eyes erupted. The man let go off him, and then stood up and faced Harry.<br>‚ÄúSo you in on it too, huh, yah, you got the water with you? Bet he does bet he does‚Äù. The others took up the chant too,<br>‚ÄúBet he does, bet he does‚Ä¶‚Äù Barnie watched as the men gathered around Harry, and then, in the darkness of night they fought. Barnie was horrofied; it looked like a bunch of people shadow boxing, only with splashes of black blood spraying about. More people approached, watching the fight. One man tried to stop it, approaching drowsily and mumbling about idiocy. One of the shadows turned and clubbed him over the head, and a solemn ‚Äúumf‚Äù shot out of his lips. That‚Äôs when the madness started. Everyone in town exploded, jumping on the shadows. Barnie watched as a beast formed, a shadow-monster screaming and flailing about, knocking over tents and smashing constructions. It began stampeding around town, smashing everything in it‚Äôs path, leaving a line of corpses and rubble in it‚Äôs wake. Barnie watched as the corpses twitched, and then wiggled, and then eventually stumble back onto their feet. They formed together and created another shadow-monster. The two monsters looked into each other and then charged, colliding into one giant blob of death. Barnie stood up and watched as the blob grew and grew, stretching across the town, consuming everything in it‚Äôs path. <br>‚ÄúThe people‚Ä¶ They stood back up‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶ But they weren‚Äôt infected‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNo Barnie‚Ä¶ They were‚Äù. Barnie gasped and turned to meet the eavesdropper. It was General.<br>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all infected Barnie‚Ä¶ Infected with the same thing the corpses are‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre infected with hunger. We all feel it, the need to kill, to hurt, to consume. We repress it, but the dead don‚Äôt‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt understand s-sir‚Ä¶ What do you mean?‚Äù General put his arm on Barnie‚Äôs shoulder, looking deeply into his eyes.<br>‚ÄúWe did this to ourselves son. We did this. We wanted the perfect soldier, and we got it. A man without any fear, without any restrictions, without any feelings at all. But what we thought was wrong. Behind all those feelings is evil. We all have it, and we all fight it, every day. But we gave in, we stopped fighting, we stopped feeling. And now‚Ä¶ We are all going to die‚Äù. Barnie watched the General carefully, uncertain of what he was being told.<br>‚ÄúS-s-sir‚Ä¶ What d-do you mean‚Ä¶‚Äù <br>‚ÄúI had to stop them, I saw how much effort it put in to saving us, and I couldn‚Äôt let it‚Äôs sacrifice be in vain. He was a brave man, and our saviour. It‚Äôs ok son, join them, it will all be over soon. No more fighting, no more fear, just give in, let it take you‚Äù. Barnie tried to pull free from General‚Äôs grasp, but it was no good. He twisted and turned, but General‚Äôs grip was too strong.<br>‚ÄúLet me help you Barnie, understand what I mean. Our brother sacrificed himself to the well to save us all. Do not let his death be in vain! Join us!‚Äù General sunk his teeth into Barnie‚Äôs neck, his tongue furiously licking the boy‚Äôs wound, urging the disease into the corpse. </em></p>

                <p><strong>Part 4</strong><br><em>The crow above watched in content. It would feast in the morning. A phenomena below caught it‚Äôs keen eyes. The fighting had stopped. But everything was still, nothing moved. The crow watched, intrigued. Had all the corpses been smashed by the living? They‚Äôre should have been a few left shambling about. It flew from its perch on the wall and landed on a corpse. It was headless. It hopped over to another. Headless too. It continued examining each body, noticing that all their heads had been severed. But where did the heads go? The tongue was quite a delicacy. Something moved over by the well. The crow took flight and circled the well, searching for the flash of movement. It found the source quickly, a man carrying a decapitated head marching toward a pile of heads. <br>‚ÄúNumber thirty-nine‚Äù the man mumbled sadly. The crow was curious about this strange mans strange actions. The sun began to rise over the horizon. Light illuminated the strange man, revealing him as blood stained and wound-infested. His brown clothes had been torn and clumps of his long hair had been torn out. His eyes were a beautiful blue, with a shine like an uncut diamond. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ Looks like it‚Äôs the last of them‚Ä¶‚Äù He stood, staring into the pile of heads. ‚ÄúWell, General‚Ä¶ Never would of guessed you were infected. And you‚Äôve been feedin us all your disease eh? Guess the water in the well just killed your disease, but the water from the plant was too dirty to dilute it huh. You clever fiend. But I also guess that means the water in the well is fine, correct. The head on the top of the pile smiled, <br>‚ÄúWhy of course, boy‚Äù.<br>‚ÄúWell, I think this has gone on long enough, sir. We‚Äôre all thirsty, and we‚Äôre all half crazed from your poisoned water, right?<br>‚ÄúWhy of course, boy‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWell, then it can‚Äôt hurt to have a drink, can it?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhy of course it can‚Äôt, boy‚Äù. The man smiled.<br>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought, sir‚Äù. The man plucked the head up and dropped it in the well. Ploosh. And then he picked up another, Ploosh. And then another, almost getting bit by it‚Äôs snapping jaws, Ploosh, ploosh, plooosh, plooosh‚Ä¶ The crow watched, entertained by the man. The man picked up the final head. It‚Äôs eyes bled tears.<br>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry buddy. This was all my fault.‚Äù<br>Ploosh.<br></em></p><p>Again, I apologize for the size. Hehehe.</p>

                <p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p>Reese leaned against a long stout wooden beam that served as a buttress for the tall wall that loomed over his head. The wall created a large shadow that gave Reese protection from the sizzling sunlight that baked the sand roughly a yard from Reese's feet. Reese's meaty fingers reached over and pried a small brown canteen from a worn rucksack that lie against the wall. They then unscrewed the small stopper and held it to his mouth. Reese lapped was left of his water in a few rapid gulps. Letting out a refreshed sigh, Reese sealed the canteen and placed it back in his rucksack. Reese then grabbed and hoisted the rucksack over his shoulders. He proceeded to pull out a black hard plastic stub protruding from one of the rucksack's many pockets. Beneath the plastic stub slid the glistening blade of a well used machete. Reese aimed the machete that he now wielded with both his hands in front of him. He stepped carefully forward along the wall, trying to not make a sound.</p><p><em>Within just a few steps, the wall to Reese's left began to disappear, leaving a large gaping hole. The hole wasn't in the original blueprint for the wall, but some rather violent demolition experts made it otherwise. The town Reese was passing through had been idle for months, as the poorly maintained grounds and damaged buildings (like the wall Reese passed by) suggested. The townspeople were still around however. They were mostly clumsily stumbling about from shadow the shadow and occasionally, if they were feeling particularly perky, beat against the shambled remains of their homes. Sometimes one would stumble outside and sometimes they'd begin wandering off from town, distracted by a windblown Plastic Bag, the shine of the sun, or for no real reason at all. Reese suddenly stopped. Before him stood a woman in bloody clothing that stared mindlessly into the sky with her back to Reese. Reese slowly stepped forward and lowered his machete horizontally around his right side. He slowed his breath and glance out the corners of his eyes for any other threats. The woman's head lowered, and whether if she had noticed him or became tired of staring at the dull sandy clouds above, Reese rushed forward and swung his machete.</em></p><p>The woman's head launched several feet to the side and her body stood still for an instant before lifelessly falling on the sand. Reese inhaled deeply and looked around to see if he had stirred anything. Not seeing anything, he moved his machete back to a resting position and he moved past the woman's head which gasped and snapped at him. He leaned against the wooden rear wall of a hovel on the outskirts of town and peered through a small hole in the wood. Inside, though it was very musty and difficult to see, he saw a worn bed on the floor and a small oven placed on a small wood nightstand. Reese guessed this must of been the town's cook's home. He hugged the wall and shuffled his way around, looked for any threats, and snuck into the battered door of the hovel. The hovel smelled stale, but there was no aroma of any unhappy home owners. Reese relaxed and looked about. In a corner, he noticed a small Beer Fridge. He leaned forward and opened it. Inside he found a lone brown bottle and a note. Reese had to lift the bottle to read the note which said:</p><p><cite><strong><em>Dear visitor,</em></strong><br><em>My name is Elliot and welcome to my home. The whiskey, if it is still there, is my gift to you. I am sitting here in my abode during the night's attack writing this note. The men and women that were called upon to serve on the wall are screaming not too far from here at the main gates. I fear tonight will be my last. I have been saving this whiskey for when I die, but I sat here for several minutes thinking about drinking it and failed to do so. I decided instead that I will enjoy my life and quit drinking so much alcohol, like my wife (God bless her soul) always told me. So I write this note that I will leave with this whiskey for you. I don't know who or what you are, but to you I say "Cheers."</em><br><strong><em>Your loving host, Elliot.</em></strong><span class="tid_sideNote"><em>P.S: you can have my clothes that I left on my bed if you want</em></span></cite></p><p>Reese smiled a cheeky grin and yanked the cork off the bottle of whiskey. He plopped himself on the bed, avoiding the pile of dirty clothes, and took a sip. "Well damn. Either I just haven't had any whiskey in a long time," Reese admired, "or this is some damn good whiskey." Reese took a few more sips to get used to the strong flavor before finally chugging back the bottle, quenching his thirst temporarily. After releasing a refreshed sigh twice as refreshing than the one he had with his water, he placed the empty squarish bottle back into the beer fridge. He then found a pencil on the dirty ground and flipped the note over, placing it on his thigh. In a hearty font, Reese wrote a big "<strong>Thanks, Elliot</strong>" and slid the note back under the bottle. With a newfound cheerful demeanor, Reese sealed the Beer Fridge again and headed to the door. He peered out and, with haste, headed off to loot as much of the town as he could before nightfall.</p>

                <p><strong>Finding Hope</strong></p><p>The desert sands shifted in the wind. Grains whipped the man across the face, almost as if the desert was reprimanding him for taking up this futile search. The man leaned on his trusty shovel and wiped his brow. The sun was lowering to the horizon but still its scorching heat went on.<br> <br><em>Hope. No, Hope.</em></p><p>The man‚Äôs thoughts were consumed by it. <em>Hope.</em> It was his mantra he repeated it over and over in his mind.<br> <br><em>Hope, why. Why Hope?</em></p><p>He couldn‚Äôt wrap his mind around the cruelty of his situation. He continued digging away at the ruin surrounding him. The sound of sand running over metal was the only thing to be heard other than the man‚Äôs grunts as he continued to chip away at the sand.</p><p><em>So little, little Hope.</em><br> <br>The man‚Äôs work continued, second by second, minute by minute. Soon an hour had passed and the man took a break. He sat in a rickety Ektorp-Gluten Chair it squeaked as he put more weight on it. He closed his eyes. He felt the stress run out of his body, he sighed.</p><p><em>How could I? How couldn‚Äôt I? I abandoned‚Ä¶ Hope‚Ä¶</em><br> <br>A low groan, the man was on his feet. The sun had set as he dozed off. The man took his shovel in hand and moved to the front of the ruin. <em>Two zombies, lazy, no problem.</em> The man clanged his shovel against a metal support to get the zombies attention. They both began shambling towards him, one of them pulling ahead of the other. <em>Too easy.</em> A vicious uppercut with the shovel beheading the foremost zombie. The man charged past the first and buried half the shovel into the brain of the second. The man panted with effort.</p><p><em>Why am I here?<br><br>Looking‚Ä¶ Finding Hope‚Ä¶</em></p><p>The man shambled back into the building and began digging. He dug quickly and furiously. The sun had set; he knew he had little time. He dug and dug, sand flying out of blown out holes in the wall, debris being thrown out as well. Thirty minutes and 3 zombies later the man sat kneeling in the ruin. He held a rusty bracelet; it had a red cross on it and emergency contact info.</p><p><em>Hope, yes Hope. Please‚Ä¶ </em></p><p>The man dug quickly now, insanely. He was close. <em>So close‚Ä¶</em> <em>close to Hope‚Ä¶</em> A minute later the man found what he had been looking for. In the small hole the man had excavated lay a small skeleton.</p><p><em>The skeleton of a child‚Ä¶<br><br>The Skeleton of my Child... <br><br>The Skeleton of Hope‚Ä¶<br></em></p>

                <p>I've been getting so bored recently that I actually started writing a mini-story.<br>I say started - I've written 3 A4 pages and I'm maybe half-way though Day 1.<br>If I go by my plan for the full thing, it should be about 50 to 60 pages long. That's A4 - most current novels and story-books are printed on paper around A5 size, so that's about 100 to 120 pages.</p><p>To be fair though, most of it is just fluff to pad it out while I try and find a way to link ideas together. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I think Die2Nite isn't the "gamer's game" with lots of buttons to push in quick succession, where you sit down for an hour ot two to play the game itself. It's more the "social game" where a large part of it is the conversation side - brings in more creative people over hardcore gamer types.</p><p>But what do I know??</p><p><em>*Goes back to two well-known First Person Shooters for a bit*</em> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p><strong>Hope is in the eye of the beholder.</strong></p><p>I quickly gathered the supplies I thought I would need. A blanket, water and a handful of sweets. It was dusk I wouldn‚Äôt be able to leave until midnight. I had a long evening of inactivity in front of me. I knew I should sleep. Rest. The coming night would be busy.</p><p>I tried to lie down. Tried to relax, but I was too restless. I forced myself to close my eyes.<br>Bright flashes on the inside of my eyelids ‚Ä¶..remembering.</p><p>Last night I was not on watch. For the first night in 3 days. I had been exhausted and had fallen asleep early. Right after a meager dinner of a canned food ration. It had tasted like dog food. Heck, it probably was dog food. A bunch of us had holed up in a town that had been ransacked long before we had arrived.</p><p>I had been asleep for just a little while when I was jerked awake by the feeling of pressure on my face. A hand covering my mouth. In the dimness of my tent, lit only by the torchlight the watchmen were carrying. I saw a woman. Maybe in her 20s? She pressed harder on my mouth, pushing my head harder into the thin mattress of the cot.</p><p>‚ÄúPlease‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt scream‚Äù <br>I managed to nod my head.</p><p>She tentively, slowly removed her hand.</p><p>She was squatting beside my cot‚Ä¶</p><p>I could easily push her back, make her topple backwards and with one scream have most of the men running to help me. One perk of being the only woman in our camp was that I always had men wanting to play hero. Even in these horrid times.</p><p>I sat up slowly.</p><p>‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù</p><p>She maintained eye contact with me as she sat on the floor. Crossing her legs Indian style.</p><p>She whispered. ‚ÄúI have been watching you the past few nights. On the wall. I thought, hoped, you would be able to help me‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúIf you have been watching me‚Ä¶.that means you were out there, in the desert. Why didn‚Äôt you show yourself?‚Äù I too, kept my voice low.</p><p>‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p><p>For the first time I could smell her‚Ä¶..the rancid, decaying smell of death. I inhaled sharply. When you want to get used to a smell and not vomit the best thing to do is take a deep inhalation so all the particles of scent are in your mouth , nose and lungs. This helps your body adapt quickly to the physicality of the stench. Her scent tasted of death.</p><p>‚ÄúYou have been bitten‚Äù I whispered harshly.</p><p>‚ÄúYes‚Äù, she replied., ‚Äú2 days ago‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help you.‚Äù I swung my legs over the opposite side of my cot and started to stand.</p><p>She reached out a hand to me.<br>‚ÄúPlease, please listen‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p><p>In her hurried whisper I heard desperation. I also heard a whimper.</p><p>Instead of standing, I turned sideways to her.</p><p>I thought it was her that whimpered‚Ä¶.<br>It wasn‚Äôt. <br>She pulled a makeshift papoose from behind her. A baby. Maybe 9 or 10 months old. Swaddled in an old blanket. In the dim light I could see the sleeping baby‚Äôs face. I could also smell it. It smelled of death too.</p><p>I gasped. Oh no, I thought. Not only would I have to kill this woman that was shape-shifting into a zombie, but I would have to kill this zombie child too.</p><p>She heard my gasp‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúNo, NO! She‚Äôs not been bitten‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThe smell‚Ä¶.she smells of zombie.‚Äù</p><p>The woman-zombie replied. ‚ÄúI smeared her with the scent. To keep her safe from the horde‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù I asked</p><p>‚ÄúPlease, please let me explain‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><p>She was on her third day. She knew all the signs and symptoms. She only had until tonight before the infection ran its course and she turned completely. She wanted me to take her daughter. Care for her. Give her protection so she could live.</p><p>She wanted to leave the child with me while she returned to the desert through a hole in the wall that she had been small enough to slip through.</p><p>Her eyes were desperate, large and wet.The pain in her voice was heavy. A weight I didn‚Äôt want to hear or be responsible for.</p><p>But a child! A child meant hope. Hope for our future. A symbol‚Ä¶‚Ä¶that life would someday be ok again. Bearable again. I looked at the sleeping child‚Äôs face. She frowned and another soft whimper escaped her rosebud lips. My heart melted.</p><p>I made the decision quickly. I would help this mother, I would help her child.</p><p>I asked her how she wanted to do this.</p><p>The mother said she would leave the child at the opening she had come through. At midnight.</p><p>I knew I couldn‚Äôt tell the rest of the camp that I had made this deal. They would never understand why I had let the woman-zombie stay in my tent and even have a conversation with me. I knew also that they would take the baby into the desert and leave her. She was weak, would be nothing but a burden to the camp. Just another mouth to feed. I would tell them I ‚Äúfound‚Äù her. Convince them I would be the sole person responsible. I could do this. My heart had already softened towards the baby. My arms already imagined the weight of her.</p><p>After discussing the details and finalizing the plan. The mother carefully lifted the sleeping baby, still swaddled in the papoose and carefully made her way to the tent opening,</p><p>I stopped her with a question. ‚ÄúWhat if you turn before midnight?‚Äù</p><p>She replied almost fiercely. ‚ÄúI will do anything to provide for my child and to insure she thrives‚Äù</p><p>I had nodded solemnly.</p><p>After replaying the previous night‚Äôs event in my mind I dozed fitfully. Waiting for midnight. <br> <br>A few minutes before midnight I stealthily made my way to the area the woman had told me she would leave the baby. The child was right where she said she would be. My eyes filled with tears at the sacrifice the woman had made for her child.</p><p>The child was sitting up‚Ä¶..playing with her toes. No longer swaddled in her papoose. When she saw me in the moonlight she smiled. As I reached to pick her up I was cooing senseless baby words to her. To calm her. To soothe her if she suddenly realized I was a stranger to her and cried for her now zombie mother.</p><p>The baby laid her head on my shoulder with a bubbly sigh. As I turned to walk back to my tent I felt her nuzzle my neck. I would need to bathe her as soon as possible!</p><p>Then I felt a searing pain. A tremendously hot pain. I felt blood pour down my chest, Over the baby as well. As I fell I felt the baby twist and felt her mouth bite into my breast. Ripping a large chunk of it away. <br>I realized I had been tricked! I dimly remembered the mother‚Äôs last words to me.</p><p>‚ÄúI will do anything to provide for my child and to insure she thrives‚Äù</p><p>With my last coherent thought I realized the child was the zombie. Not the mother.</p>

                <p>I wanna share this story of mine <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><br><br><p><strong>The Shaman's Plan</strong></p><p>It was a peaceful and coordinated town. But Chaos will come in a most convenient time...</p><br><p>It was dusk when a mysterious man passed by the town. He was wearing a weird orange mask. The citizens did not suspect him and asked him if he want to stay with them for the night.</p><p>He said, "I won't stay here. I see that you are all busy scavenging and building defenses. I would help you. You can get this revolvers for free. But I will come back here tomorrow at dusk, and you will pay me."</p><p>Most of the citizens didn't think it was suspicious that a masked man was selling them weapons, even if the town mayor told them to be cautious of other people who didn't lived in the town, but they took the guns.</p><p>Little did they know that the man was a Shaman<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_shaman.gif" alt=":hordes_chaman:" class="tid_ico">, who lived on magick and souls. The man laughed like a maniac when he left the town. The citizens were laughing with glee, because they have guns that will help them defend the town against the Horde. <img src="http://www.die2nite.com/favicon.ico" alt=":hordes:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The spell put by the Shaman on the guns took effect while they were scavenging in the World Beyond , and the citizens started to shoot each other. It was a massacre. The remaining survivors returned to town when their handful of bullets run out. One of them still had a bullet, but he didn't used it.</p><p>At the town gates<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_door.gif" alt=":hordes_porte:" class="tid_ico">, the town mayor<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_sick.gif" alt=":hordes_erk:" class="tid_ico"> who was an old man and smelled like Pine Fresh became angry<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_rage.gif" alt=":hordes_grr:" class="tid_ico">. He expected them to bring things from the World Beyond, but they just stared into him. They started to beat him and then someone shot the mayor at the temple.</p><p>The remaining people panicked, as they heard the famished cries by the Horde.<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_zombie.gif" alt=":hordes_zombie:" class="tid_ico"> There was no one who could lead them, so they all hid in their own homes.<img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_home.gif" alt=":hordes_home:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The Hordes were miraculously kept at bay. The town mayor, even with his arthritic knees and wriggling arms, finished creating the thick walls around the town. The others were relieved and paid their respects to the mayor.</p><p>Still, the mysterious man returned at dusk, like what he said. The same people who were brainwashed by the spell, sold the soul of their town mayor and the man gave them machine guns. And then the started shooting each other, as the town became devastated. The shaman laughed, and got all the souls, and went to his own town, muttering,<br>"Now our mayor won't get angry at me for being lazy. And at least my hands were not stained by the blood of these stupid pigs."</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p>

Laughter and silly conversation echoed throughout the nights air. People from all walks of life were there; the young, the old, the weak, the strong. People that would never have even looked each other in the eye before all this but that didn't matter now. Telling stories of their lives, true or false, it wasn't important. For the time being they were lost. Lost in each others eyes, lost in each others smiles, in each others happiness. Nobody wished for morning. Nobody wished they would ever be found.</p>

                <p><strong>The Wasted Traveler</strong></p><p><em>A long brown robe fluttered in the wind. A mysterious pair of brown eyes peered out from the rags at the glow of the sunset. The man was leaning on a large, well-crafted staff, wobbling with the breeze. The dirty rags on the front of his torso were dark brown, stained recently by a thick liquid. His eyes drooped with a drunken stupor. He stood erect from his staff and looked down the sandy hill. He then smiled drunkenly and swung out one tanned, scrape-covered leg. Unfortunately for the wasted traveler, he had terrible footwork and gravity was not very kind to him.</em></p><p><strong><em>"Whhooooaaaa! Ow! Ouch! Ompf!"</em></strong></p><p>His foot landed awkwardly on the sandy slope, immediately loosing its traction and collapsing the side of the hill. He fell like a tumbleweed, his rags fluttering wildly as he rolled down the hill. His grip loosened on his trusty staff in the process of his decline of both height and dignity.</p><p><strong><em>Thup!</em></strong></p><p><em>He came to an abrupt stop at the base of the hill, causing the sand to scatter beneath him. His legs were sprawled out before him and he felt twice as disoriented. He sat there idle for a second trying to compose his thoughts when suddenly a wooden knock sounded from his skull.</em></p><p><strong><em>THONK!</em></strong></p><p>The staff bounced off his head onto the sand in front of him in a comical manner before rolling on the floor laughing. It didn't really laugh but it would of if it could. It would have felt happy about getting back at this dope it had been forced to assist all week long if it was a sentient being. Sadly, it was just an inanimate staff that gave no giggle as it merely rolled on the sand in front of its owner who grumbled slurred swears from under his raggedy cloak.</p><p><strong><em>"Blasted fcuhing stick. I.. I hate this stu- *hic* stoopid thing. If I was that fcuhing thing I'd.. I'd uh.. shit. *hic* Wait.. yeah! I'd shit myself! Just like I did yesterday!<br>...<br> So fcuh- *huc* -ing embercing that I did that when they were.. the fcuhers.. threwing me out.. Grah!"</em></strong></p><p><em>The wasted traveler then angrily punched the sand, disrupting the sand which retaliated by flinging itself in his mouth.</em></p><p><strong><em>"Plah! *hic* Stoopid sand..."</em></strong></p><p><em>The wasted traveler spat out the sand in disgust, making sour faces, and grabbed his staff. He stood up again and continued to march forward, only occasionally loosing his balance and stumbling again.</em></p><p>He wandered for hours in the dark while on his noble quest. His quest was to find more booze and get more drunker. He may be a worthless bottle worshiper, but you have to give him credit on his effort. During his drunken traveling, he encountered a large old scrapyard and traversed this treacherous terrain by staggering around, tripping painfully into piles of hard steel, and stomping on different items from rusty screws to the old highlight of a time-forgotten Harley. He stumbled into the small office shack of the scrapyard. He was missing one brown sandal and his other had a collection of small metallic bits protruding uncomfortable around his toes. Somehow, he had not been seriously stabbed by any of the sharp, rusty objects laying around. He thanked his very calloused feet and decided to reward them by allowing them rest. He laid on the floor of the small building and immediately fell asleep.</p><p><em>That night was very unpleasant but the wasted traveler paid no mind as he snoozed right through it, cuddling a paper filled binder close to his chest and sucking on his thumb. The building, however, was much more displeased. It swayed and creaked in defiance of the sandy storm's mighty roar. The wind was so intense that large pieces of shrapnel punctured the thin walls of the shack. By the time the storm ceased, the shack looked like a giant wooden pin cushion and a wall had partly collapsed.</em></p><p><strong><em>"Mwwwwuuuuuuuuuuuuaaaaahh... Ouf.. me head."</em></strong></p><p>The wasted traveler awoke from his sleep with a yawn and examined his surroundings with a very blurry and confused gaze. He had little to no remembrance of being kicked out of town and wandering for hours upon hours. He had no idea how he got here and why he was clutching a drool-covered white binder. He dropped the binder and picked up his valiant staff. He put his feet down and raised himself with the staff and then proceeded out the door.</p><p><strong><em>"The sun, me old nemesis. Grhh.. I hate headaches."</em></strong></p><p><em>He was oddly fine with his lack of information about his surroundings and predicament. He looked at the wall of metallic spikes while holding his head with his right hand. <br>Interesting decor to say the least. <br>He managed to find a way out of the scrapyard rather quickly when it was bright and he wasn't as drunk. He continued to keep going forward, shielding his eyes from the the sun and stopping a few times to vomit. Eventually, he spotted a truck on the horizon and went prone. He squinted, causing his headache to increase in pain, and could barely make out a figure near the truck. He pondered whether or not he should make contact with the man when suddenly he heard a moan from behind him.</em></p>

He's one of those big shots you know the guys that swan around town carrying people back from the wastes, returning from the furthest reaches in the blink of an eye, even when they get tired sometimes if you see them fall from exhaustion from fighting off zombies with their bare hands! they just look at the brown dirt they have fallen too for a moment, then they stand bolt upright and continue with a new fire in their eyes. well this ones name was Daryl he was a survivalist he's a hero I must trust him.</p><p>Day 4<br>even while I wither away in the wastes he can find food and water, but just enough for himself he says, puddles and roots, puddles and roots. that's all they ever look out for you know! Number one! I feel so weak</p><p>Day 5<br>I collapsed today, near another body, a fellow traveller, Daryl didn't care much, but I tried eating the dirt near him today, it was wet, my hero told me not too, that is was dangerous but I needed something, anyway this is the man who's happy to see me die of my basic primal needs! it tasted bad at first it was a kind of congealed blob, I say dirt because I have no other word for it, but it burst and sweet thick liquid enters my mouth, I feel better now.</p><p>Day 6<br>I got so thirsty and hungry and he would not share, he sleeps now so I took it from him, in the night, while he slept, didn't see it coming, didn't want me to have it! he sleeps now<br>I drank deep of what he provided and feasted on the bounty of food! There was much more than I had expected it began to fill me as I ate from him. I'm tired now</p><p>Day 7<br>gonna go back to town, there are lots more of puddles and roots there!</p>

                <p>So there I was, fighting off three zombies at once when I noticed Vinnie's pinky ring at the top of a zombie dung heap - proving Vinnie had been eaten at least a few days before. This is what I needed to get the town off my back, now they couldn't justify hanging me the next morning. Problem was, I was too busy fighting, chopping, blocking, and running out of strength.</p><p>Then it happened, the inner wall fell, right on top of the pile of festering dung and Vinnie's ring. I was fighting to live but if I lived I would die by the hands of my town's residents. Did it matter if I won even if I lost in the end? About that time one of the hero's came over and tore through a couple of the zombies with a machete, and then threw an exploding water bomb - there was a tremendous steam cloud that quickly spawned and I could barely see in front of me.</p><p>Confused, I started twirling around and slashing with my Box Cutters in each hand just hoping to rip at anything too close. My left hand suddenly went into what felt like jello - I had punched through the gut of a zombie and yet could not pull it back out quickly, as my knife and hand were inside the zed's ribcage, and then his mouth came toward me, snapping his blackened teeth and pulling me closer, so close that I, that I...</p>

                <p>So I had a random bout of insomnia the other day, and decided to write a short story for the town telling a story from a rather different perspective, and it turned into a story of how the zombie plague came to be. A couple of my fellow townies told me to post it into the world forums, and since this thread is here it seemed like a good place to do it. I hope you enjoy.</p><p>The Confession -</p><p>There is something that no one ever seems to think about as the world is ending. What happens afterwards? Now this is a pretty understandable mistake to make, as the whole concept of ending usually implies that there will not be anything afterwards. And yet, there is. Is it hell? Did the end of the world actually kill us all and now we have wound up in a hell not full of pitchfork wielding demons, but shambling hordes of brain eating zombies?<br>I know the truth, however. I know what caused it.<br>It was me.<br>Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Dr. Albert Curie Tesla Smith. No, the name isn‚Äôt a joke, my parents decided that I would be a scientist even before I was born, and they decided that simply being Dr. Smith wouldn‚Äôt be sufficiently ‚Äòsciency‚Äô for lack of a better word. So they decided to name me after 3 of history‚Äôs greatest minds. And then they forced me into the mold they had chosen for me. And I was a good boy. I did what my parents told me.<br>My doctorate is technically in Nanomechanical Bio-Engineering. Which means I built little tiny‚Ä¶ well, you can call them machines, but the word breaks down when you get into things that small. Is it a machine if it is really just a string of proteins and RNA inside a cellular wall? We did have a different word for them once.<br>We called them Viruses.<br>And I built one, piece by meticulous piece. I built one to order. I designed it to heal. It would do everything that our own bodies couldn‚Äôt do, and do it on the cellular level. It would find wounds, and heal them by constructing individual cells and linking them together in a latticework, just as our own bodies do, only thousands of times faster. And I solved the issue of making them figure out how to do all this, by networking them all together. One, or one hundred, or even a hundred thousand was pretty much useless. But a billion? 10 billion? 100 billion? They could follow simple programs.<br>Ahh, hubris. I thought I could make humanity immortal with my machines. We would live forever. The virus did what it was programmed to do, and it made sure that we didn‚Äôt die. We couldn‚Äôt. The virus would prevent that from happening. But I made my mistakes. It wasn‚Äôt ready to be used, I did understand that, I am a scientist after all. I knew that the virus was not ready for human testing, though I had high hopes. It worked in a small scale test in laboratories, on rats, but that was a long way from human testing. But I forgot about two ‚Äòlittle‚Äô things. The purpose of all viruses is to reproduce, and I had used a virus as the core of my ‚Äòmachine‚Äô. So it reproduced. The second thing is that a rat that is pissed off from poking and prodding will bite, and rat teeth are really good at chewing through things. And so it bit me, and I made my third mistake. I swore, cleaned out the wound, and went home.<br>My virus operated at a greatly accelerated rate. It used up the resources in a human body very quickly, building cells, repairing damage. The human body is a complex machine after all. And it needs a lot of resources. That first day it spread through my body rapidy, using my own body‚Äôs resources to reproduce itself, causing horrific damage to me on a cellular level in the process, though that took the better part of a day to occur. So when I washed out my bite at home I didn‚Äôt know that anything was wrong, though I felt a little under the weather. The virus did what viruses do, however, and it spread into the water supply, and then of course inexorably the virus spread into the food chain, quickly breaking down anything it came into contact with, and then doing what it was programmed to do. Build a human body. From the ground up.<br>Do you know how much of the human body is water? How much is used up when you build a human out of raw materials? That is what most of those poor wretches are out there, human bodies created virtually from nothing by a virus doing what it is programmed to do. Only there is one problem. The human mind takes time to develop. Years to reach the point where it is really capable of anything that could remotely be conceived of as thought, and that is only if the brain is taught. The virus, however, is not a loving parent. All it can do is keep the poor wretch stumbling around, constantly hungry, looking for food, as any baby would be, and since most of the food has been eaten already, well actually dissolved into component parts would be a better term, the only readily available source any more is humanity. Because the virus can‚Äôt think, you see. It can‚Äôt reason that the person its host is eating is a human being that it should be protecting; it is simply a source of food. But within a few bites, the virus settles into the new host, and then it starts to breed when it discovers something that its programming recognizes.<br>At this point you might be thinking, well, why is that so bad? Admittedly the poor wretches that were created virtually from nothing had no minds to speak of, but what about a thinking human being? We already have minds. And the virus is designed to make us immortal. Why would that be so bad? And the simple fact of the matter is that when the virus spreads throughout the entire body it gains enough processing power to override the nerve impulses in the synapses of a human body. And then you get to the true horror of it all. You see, I specifically designed this version of the virus to leave the brain alone. I am no neural scientist. I intended to work with an expert later on to work on a way to help victims of brain trauma, but I hadn‚Äôt gotten that far yet. I was still in the preliminary stages after all. So the virus can‚Äôt modify the brain, though it seems to do a decent job of building a basic one. But it can control the body readily enough. Control it enough to search out more sources of food, and more ways to breed.<br>The remaining uninfected humans have discovered that pouring water onto one of the infected dissolves the body. They think that it is a good way to kill the infected, but they are wrong. What they are seeing isn‚Äôt destruction, but actually growth. The water gives the virus more raw materials to work with. Yes, the body will break down immediately, but the next day there will be more growing up in its place, once again created from raw materials, using the extra water that it needed. The poor remaining uninfected humans think they have the perfect weapon, but all they are doing is speeding up their own destruction.</p>

                <p>My body lurches forwards as the virus uses its poor control over my muscles to force me towards the walled fort. I can feel the others around me now, some kind of weird gestalt mind that is created when this many infected are around. We tend to move as one, in a swarm, like a cloud of gnats or a school of fish. I wonder how many of them are intelligent, people become prisoners in their own bodies like me, and how many of them are blank slates, created from nothing like horribly twisted caricatures of the mythic Titans.<br>We lurch towards the building, and begin slamming our fists into the walls. Eventually we will batter them down. We always do. A few brave souls stand out on the walls, attacking with makeshift weapons, not knowing that the wounds they inflict will be healed again by morning. A few throw some precious water bombs out into the horde, and I see a few infected dissolve down to components cells which sink into the ground as the virus strives to gather all the precious water, and find enough other raw materials to be able to create 2 infected bodies where there was once only one.<br>My fists pound on the walls and I pray that this time, finally, one of those water bombs will find me, and I will dissolve into unthinking, unfeeling goo, and my pitiful hellish existence will finally be over. Perhaps I have finally paid enough for my sins.<br>A small crack is developing in the wall in front of me. I hear arguing and bickering from inside. This small walled town is not ready for us, and the recriminations fly. I can hear people blaming one another. The crack in the wall widens slightly. Already it is at the point where if I were in control of my body I could simply slip my hands into the crack and rip it open. But the virus cannot reason that well. All it can do is pound on the wall, but that will be enough. Eventually. The horde cannot ever truly be stopped.<br>The sun comes up, and the town is still standing. The sun begins to beat down, and the horde retreats. I am not sure how it happened, but the horde has learned that the sunlight will eventually desiccate a body to the point where the virus is forced to go dormant, and so when the sun comes up we retreat to bury ourselves in the sand, or to hide in old ruined buildings, or any other place where we can escape the heat. A few remain active, again part of the primitive collective intellect of the virus having learned the uninfected will be out to search for useful supplies during the day. Today I am one of the ones that has buried themselves.<br>Hours pass, and I hear someone moving overhead, but the hive mind does not allow me to react. I can hear digging and scrabbling as the survivor looks for anything in the vicinity that they could use. I can also feel several of the infected lurching around on the surface, trying to fulfill their programming and spread to a new host. It sounds as though the survivor up there is able to keep away from them, however. Every now and then I can hear a loud thud, probably the survivor pushing over the infected on the surface in order to buy some more time to get away. I hope they succeed. The sounds of digging and movement stop after a while, and I think the survivor has moved on. I would breathe a sigh of relief if I could, but I am not in control of my body enough to even do that, and it is not as if I breathe any more anyway. Somehow the virus appears to be turning my body into a fully anaerobic machine. I try to work out how and why it is doing that, and the musing allows me to keep what is left of my sanity for another day.<br>Eventually I dig myself free of the sand, emerging into the night once again. Around me I see the rest of the horde clawing their way up out of the sand, in a horrific parody of birth, and as one we turn and lurch towards the town again. I hear screams and shouts, ahead. The gates have been shut, but there is still someone outside. There is also someone hanging over the wall on some kind of makeshift gibbet. The survivors are stupid. If they had tacked the body down somewhere outside they could have distracted some of the horde from the attack. The survivor that is outside keeps pounding on the door, screaming, but no one lets him in. The first of the horde reaches him. I wish I could look away, but I am still moving that direction. I wish I could shut out the screams of someone being eaten alive, but I can‚Äôt. At least this time I am not close enough to reach the body in time to take a bite.<br>The remaining parts of the victim are already beginning to heal as the virus spreads through what is left of the infected tissues. This one reached the threshold of infection very quickly, perhaps due to the large number of bites he received at one time, so his body was mostly intact. Luckily for this one, although he was eaten alive his brain was not left intact enough for him to be sentient when he gets back up again, so at least he will be spared that. The rest of the horde moves past the body, and begins pounding on the walls again. The cracks spread more rapidly than they did the day before. There is evidence of repair work, and now the walls have been studded with bits of razor wire and other assorted old chunks of metal. I watch as my flesh is shredded down to the bone time and time again, thankful that the blocks to my synapses also prevent me from feeling the pain. Again I hear the recriminations and threats being yelled back and forth inside. There are fewer guards up on the walls tonight too, perhaps the one left outside or the one who was hung had been amongst the brave ones fighting yesterday. Towards the dawn we have almost broken down the wall, but once again the town is saved by the dawn.<br>My body turns and I stumble away. Today I am mobile, staying out of the sand, looking for survivors. I tend to stay more in the shade, but I can feel my body stiffening up as some of the precious water evaporates from my body in some twisted parody of sweating. It is not long before a survivor from the town comes out looking for things to scavenge. This one is a woman, and she clutches a Super Soaker water gun slung from a strap on her shoulder. I lurch towards her, seeing my hands reach out towards her. Around me I feel the other infected that are in the immediate area doing the same. She looks at me, and I see the calculation pass though her eyes. She knocks me down with a quick kick to my knee. I fall over, unable to dodge even a simple kick. As my body begins to laboriously get to its feet I see her shoot a gout of water at a nearby infected. I want to shout ‚ÄúNO, SHOOT ME!‚Äù at her, but of course I can‚Äôt. That infected dissolves quickly, and she runs past the puddle of goo, shooting another as she runs. That one dissolves too. Then she is out of sight, over a hill. Unseen by her, the other infected in the area move towards puddles of goo trying to collect enough water for themselves out of the remains to be able to dissolve themselves. I finally manage to get to my feet and lurch in that direction as I see another of the infected in the area is apparently able to extract enough water to begin the dissolution process itself. Of course, by the time I get there, there is nothing left but a slight stain on the sand. At that point my mind finally snaps, and I give up trying to hold onto my sanity. I am cursed. I will be trapped in this hellish existence forever, as punishment for my crimes.<br>I do not know how much time I lose, but when I come too again I am standing in the wreckage of the town. No one is left except for infected, and as one the horde turns and moves off to the north. Somehow we know that there are surviving uninfected in that direction.<br>There won‚Äôt be for long.</p>

Write <em>anything</em> relating to The Almighty Pastry and his lore. Or write new lore, folktale, origin, etc. It can be praising, silly, serious, bashing- I don't mind. I just wanna read some amazing stories. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now some of you of course probably find it a bit egotistical of me, so there is a backup theme of <strong>Die2Nite-Based Religion</strong>. Write about <em>any</em> Die2Nite religions or make up your own. It just has to be within the Die2Nite universe.</p><br><p>And with that I say..<br><strong><em>LET THE GAMES BEGIN!</em></strong><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

From there, I started watching the landscape around me. Sand, and only sand, sand so far as my eyes could see. Not a single cloud in the sky, whose azure tones merged hypnotically with the mirage dancing in the horizon. But the only reply to my words was the high-pitched yip next to me feet. Itchykins, my dog, stared at me as he panted heavily. I took a gulp from my water canteen and poured some of the water onto the labradoodle's mouth. Feeling better, he wagged his tail and barked. I felt better too. From my position, I spotted something in the horizon. A number of big rocks were strewn around in the sand. I thought it would be worth investigating it, so we continued walking through the scorching desert.</p><p>A few minutes later, I felt exhausted. The rocks were close already, but all the weight of the junk I picked and now I carried around was definitely taking a toll on my undernourished body. I felt hungry, and I couldn't remember when was the last time I had eaten something that wasn't moldy, raw and/or alive. I was lucky that this natural formation of rocks in that place of the desert was tall enough that it gave a bit of shade if I remained on the side opposite to the sun. One of the rocks in the shade was large and flat enough so I could rest there. Although I heard a large snake hissing nearby as saw it coiled on top of the rock, I scared it off throwing a few small rocks at it. It quickly scurried away. I sat and, without thinking too much, put my bag around Itchykins' neck. I didn't have to say anything to him. He knew what that meant. He ran off at full speed, heading back to the town on his three legs, despite the scorching heat and the long distance to it. I wished I was so full of energy like that.</p><p>Sitting there by myself,I stared at the blue sky. Thinking. Once more, I made the same question I made to myself every day. Was it really worth living that way? But I reached the same conclusion as always. That was not living. We all were dead already. Some tried to deny that truth and kept clinging on to hope. Others refused to resign, saying that they would keep fighting to the bitter end. And others, like me, pretended to have hope and kept going, but knowing that we wouldn't last long. The rest were simply too drunk or too stupid to see our impending demise. They demanded citizens to keep building those improvised defenses, hoping they would hold out. I remembered something. A phrase I read somewhere, though I can't remember who said it, or when: ‚ÄúFortifications are a monument to the stupidity of man‚Äù, they said. I finally understood what it meant. With more of them coming every midnight, we were powerless. We couldn't fight them. Not all of them. The defenses would ultimately overrun and we all would get killed. But I couldn't blame those people for being blind in their ignorance. Nobody wanted to die anyway.</p><p>The biggest irony, however, was the true nature of those citizen's intentions. Of those who refused to die and kept demanding everyone to keep working. ‚ÄúIt's all for the benefit of the town‚Äù, they said. As they demanded citizens to keep risking their lives for the town, they all said it was for the benefit of the community. And for them, the death of a single citizen was of little concern. It didn't matter to the town's survival as a whole, anyway. They thought of me, of us, as a little more than expendable worker bees. But I had seen it before. I knew well what they really planned. With people like them, it is all about teamwork until the leave you to die by yourself as they take care of their own survival when things go awry. People are always the same selfish creatures.</p><p>I sighed loudly when a noise interrupted this moment of rest and reflection. It was the unmistakable groaning of a zombie. At least they were always kind enough to warn me of their presence, groaning deeply before they approached. It was a single zombie, and I certainly could keep it at bay if I needed to. But I knew that I would not feel easy as long as that rotter lurked around. I reached for my bag, but it wasn't there anymore. I remembered I had sent Itchykins with it back to town, and I had forgotten to take my Battery Launcher Mk.II out of it. I mumbled some impolite words as I tried to back off from the zombie. Building that Launcher had gotten me into trouble with some of the worst people in town. Jack, who thought of himself as some sort of comedian, making unfunny jokes at the worst time possible, had publicly affronted me for that. It was obvious for me that he was the kind of person that turns tail and leaves you to die by yourself if things didn't went as they wish. I had to endure all that criticism to keep myself safe, but all that would be useless if I got killed there.</p><p>However, I was suddenly blinded by a bluish flash of light. I had no idea of what had happened. I opened my eyes, only to see a bright blue orb of light floating in front of me, just between the zombie and me. It looked like a ball of blue fire, burning silently with an eerie glow. I felt too scared to even move. Was it one of those ball lightnings I had read about? It was unlikely. The sky was clear and cloudless. And that orb floated silently in front of me, as it appeared to be burning. But it disappeared suddenly, as quickly as it had appeared. It vanished without a trace, and I wondered if it had only been an hallucination. The zombie, however, also remained immobile. I could swear I saw some surprise in its dead blank eyes. In that moment of distraction, I pushed the zombie back with all my strength, hoping to make it fall so I could run away safely. I was lucky that the zombie hit its head against one of the rocks, and its skull cracked open. I have to admit that killing that zombie with my bare hands was as satisfying as it was disgusting.</p><p>Itchykins returned to me a few minutes later, with an exhausted stare in his eyes. Deciding that I had had enough for the day, we headed back home. I wasn't in the mood to keep searching for junk out in the desert. I was still puzzled about the incident that had just happened.</p><p>The next day, early in the morning. The sky was still dark and the sun was about to rise up in the eastern skies. I was awakened by a sudden series of bustling noises outside. For some strange reason I felt compelled to go outside and investigate. As I reached the town's plaza, I was surprised to see a murder of crows, a pretty fitting name for a group of such birds, feeding on the body of David, the man who claimed to be the town's shaman. He was dead, and it seemed like his death had been very recent. I could see that he was still wearing his wooden mask. I tried to scare the birds off, waving my arms menacingly. They took flight, crowing loudly and flapping their wings and flying off into the desert. One of them, however, a particularly large crow, remained standing over the corpse and stared at me, seeming defiant, before taking a piece of the corpse's liver on its beak and flying away. Witnessing that just made me shiver.</p><p>David had been the town's self-proclaimed shaman, who said he could establish a connection with the spirits. He claimed that to be able to cure sickness and problems with his mystical power. Nobody believed him, though, as we all knew that he was just a senile old man. But as I saw his corpse lying on the town's plaza, I noticed a book we was clutching tightly between his still warm arms. I got the impression that he had died defending that book from someone or something. I took the book and returned home. The last thing I wanted was to be found next to the corpse and end up being the scapegoat accused for his death.</p><p>I put my bedside lamp next to me and placed a battery inside the thing. I had managed to smuggle those with me from the desert without telling anyone, and if someone saw me using that battery, they would definitely get mad at me. With that faint light from the lamp I started reading the book. It was a very old book, with all its pages showing that yellowish color of all the decades it had survived. Some pages were torn, and others were missing. And someone had scribbled notes and corrections all over it, some looking newer than others. But one of the pages caught my attention. I read the title. A short story was entitled ‚ÄúGreat Spirits‚Äù and another was called ‚ÄúLost Souls‚Äù. I assumed that it was the reason why the old man David had become crazy, reading books about spirits and that kind of things. As I held the book in my hands to read it, I noticed a small piece of paper falling off from between two pages. A small paper sheet. The type of paper was completely different to that of the book. It was new and made of low-quality paper. I saw that it was some sort of sales report document from a PI-KEYA Furniture shop. What was interesting, though, was that someone had written recently something on the back. I assumed it was David's. The handwriting was small and difficult to read, but I managed to read it with a bit of effort:</p>

                <p><em>‚ÄúThe Shakano tribe of natives lived once on this desert. They had a very strong connection with the mystical forces that drive this planet. I heard from them when I was a child. My grandfather used to tell me the stories of the Shakano, and gave me this book. I always thought of it as a collection of mythological stories and the religious texts of a tribe that disappeared already. But now I know that it is all true.</em></p><p>I have seen it. The spirit of Or-Ateni is in this area. He flies around and perches atop of the watchtower, mocking me with its dark shiny eyes. I know that my demise is close. Those who find these notes, be wary of Or-Ateni. He and his army of fiends will definitely attempt to kill you. The mask I wear will show you visions of those who roam the desert. Use the power of the wanderers to aid you.‚Äù</p><p>I dismissed the text as the ramblings of a crazy old man with paranoid delusions. However, I was more interested in the book itself, so I started reading it in a hurry before dawn arrived:</p><p><em>‚ÄúThe Great Spirits<br><br>According to the Shakano folklore, The Great Spirits are the gods and goddesses who created this world. According to their legends, the Great Spirits are limitless as the stars, bigger than the sun and the moon, and stronger than anything the human mind can imagine. The Great Spirits created everything with their boundless power. They created the human race, and then created the lesser Spirits to guide them in their lives, and keep them safe as long as the humans worshipped them.<br><br>The four lesser Spirits were Ashanat, the spirit of water and life; Masati, the spirit of fire and war, Akot, the spirit of food and prosperity, and Or-Ateni, the spirit of night and death. They were represented by the eagle, the wolf, the snake and the crow, respectively, and they believed that the Spirits took their animal forms to watch their people closely. <br><br>The Great Spirits and the lesser Spirits were all revered by the shamans of the Shakano tribe, who used their connection with them to lead their tribe, and to make their most important decisions. The Shakano made great, complex ceremonies where they believed that the Spirits blessed objects and amulets, that would protect the wearer and would allow them to form a connection with them<br><br>However, at a time of crisis, a deadly disease appeared from out of nowhere, killing one third of the population of the tribe in just a few months. The survivors felt betrayed by the Spirits and placed the blame on Or-Ateni, the Spirit of death, who had failed to protect them from the plague, causing the premature deaths of many people. For this reason, they stopped worshiping him as one of the Spirits. And Or-Ateni felt deeply offended...‚Äù</em></p><p>The story continued, but I heard someone ringing the watchtower's bell. That meant it was time to get up and start working. I turned off and hid my lamp and the book, awakened my labradoodle and went outside to start that day's hard labor.</p><p>As I stocked up on supplies from the bank for that day's expedition, and as I hid my Battery Launcher from my envious neighbors' eyes, I couldn't help but keep thinking about the story about the spirits. Or-Ateni, the Spirit of death who took form of a crow, the note David wrote about seeing the Spirit in the area and knowing about his impending demise, and that murder of crows that were feasting on his dead body. And especially that crow that stared and me and creeped me out. Was it all a coincidence? I knew it had to be. Spirits and ghosts are nothing but fairy tales told to children to scare them, and the story was just a mythological tale from a tribe that didn't exist anymore, if it ever existed.</p><p>A few minutes later, as I headed towards the town's gates, I was readying myself to go out into the desert once more when I looked up to the watchtower and saw that big black bird perched at the top, staring at me, giving me the same creepy sensation I had felt previously. But trying to avoid relating it to the story I had read, I headed outside.</p><p>I took the same route as the previous day, as there had been places that I had missed or not searched thoroughly. But my mind was still thinking about the tale I had read early that morning. I could swear that I still could see the stare of that crow when I closed my eyes.</p><p>When I felt exhausted, I sent Itchykins back to town once more, this time making sure he only took the stuff I didn't need. I sat on the same rock like the last time. This time I closed my eyes to try and relax for a minute, which could hopefully help me clear my mind a little. But just a few seconds later, I heard my dog barking like mad. I had never heard him barking so desperately. I opened my eyes and took my weapon, ready to help my dear friend if he was in danger. But I saw how that bright blue orb of fire had appeared just in front of him. The orb disappeared after ten or fifteen seconds, and the dog's barking ceased as soon as it disappeared. Then Itchykins returned to town like nothing had happened. I wondered again if that had really happened, or if I was just hallucinating. Was I losing my mind, just like David had lost his?</p><p>Later that day, I found myself back in town. All of my thoughts revolved around that old book and its story. It was starting to obsess me. With little regard about what my neighbors thought, I didn't even place the junk I picked from the desert on the town's bank. I locked myself up in my shack and took the book from where I had hidden it. I kept on reading the same story that I had read in the morning:</p><p>‚Äú<em>Or-Ateni, the lesser Spirit of death who took the form of the crow, was chased away by the Shakano people. He retreated into the desert, to plan his revenge. As the years went by, as he started putting all of the mankind under a curse. That course would befall onto the descendants of those who had offended him, and it would then spread to all of the humanity. The curse says that the day when people have lost all their faith in the Great Spirits, the dead will rise from their graves. His army of the dead sits silently in the netherworld, until the day of the awakening, in which they will drag all of the humanity into the ranks of Or-Ateni's army of the dead, until no person is left alive.</em>‚Äù</p><p>That was the end of the first story. I quickly read the second story:</p><br><br><p>‚Äú<em>The Lost Souls.<br><br>It is said that those who fall before the curse of Or-Ateni will transform into monsters. Shambling monsters seeking to feed on the living beings. The only way to stop them will be to use the powers of Ashanat, the spirit of water and life. <br><br>However, those that fall victims to the curse of Or-Ateni will be trapped between this world and the netherworld. Their bodies will belong to Or-Ateni, but their souls will roam in the world for eternity. They are called the Lost Souls, or the Wanderers. It is said that they will take the form of an eternal blue flame, moving though the desert for the rest time. Only those with the holy mask of the Shakano shaman would be capable of reading their movements and use their mystical power to form a bond with Ashanat and destroy Or-Ateni's curse. When Or-Ateni's curse is broken, the army of the dead will stop and the Lost Souls will be able to have their eternal rest.</em>‚Äù</p><p>I stopped reading after this. I could see why David had become obsessed. The zombies being destroyed by water. The crow lingering around the town. The orbs of blue light wandering around the desert. It was too much to be a simple coincidence. My mind was overwhelmed by that. My eyes had seen it all.</p><p>I went to the town's small cemetery. I knew David's corpse would not be there anymore, as it was dumped out of town as per the town's rules. But I found that his mask and his useless belongings had been placed over his improvised grave as a sign of respect. It was a round wooden mask, that seemed to be very old.I put it on, but I didn't feel anything unusual. But when I closed my eyes, I saw something, like an image projected directly on my mind. An image of the desert from above, as if I was flying and could see everything from above. As if I could see from the eyes of an eagle. And those orbs of blue fire moving around in circles. If I concentrated enough, I knew I could predict their movement.</p><p>I smiled and brought the mask to my home. I knew that trying to convince people about what I had seen would be impossible. They would think of me as a madwoman, like I had thought of David. I was the only one who could use that power. I went outside, and saw that big crow perched on top of the watchtower, staring at me. But I didn't feel afraid. I smiled at him. As long as the Shakano shaman's mask existed, we would have hopes of destroying the curse. I just needed to find a way of reaching Ashanat, using the wandering souls of the dead, so the zombie curse could be lifted. Now I could cling onto hope myself. And have faith on the Great Spirits. I just had to survive long enough to see that day arrive.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúBrother Robert, are the monsters coming to eat us?‚Äù I pulled my cassock slightly tighter around myself, tying my belt tighter to give myself one last moment before I had to answer that question. Oh, how I wished sometimes that the abbot were still alive to release me from my oath to tell no falsehoods. <br>‚ÄúYes Lizzie. The monsters are coming.‚Äù Her brave little face, smudged and dirtied by the harsh existence we had followed since I found her 2 weeks ago, scrunched up in fear. But she gripped my hand tightly, and looked up at me with her trusting eyes.<br>‚ÄúIt is o.k. Brother Robert. I know you will save us.‚Äù I looked down at her, wishing that I could do just such a thing. But I did not know how. What could I do to save us? There were dozens of zombies outside the building. They battered on the walls tirelessly, and I could see the cracks forming already. From time to time one would try to force its hand through the crack to reach us, but so far there was no way for it to reach us. I didn‚Äôt hold out much hope for us surviving the night, however.<br>I pulled Lizzie close to me, and crooned gently to her, trying to rock her to sleep. Despite the terror of being inside a building that was slowly being battered down, her exhaustion showed through. It took only a few minutes of gentle rocking and tuneless singing for her to fall deeply asleep. I smoothed the hair back from her forehead, and leaned down to kiss her gently. And then, carefully, just the way I had been taught all those years before in the Rangers, I snapped her neck.<br>The tears rolled down my cheeks. I had sworn, when I took my vows all those years before, that I would never kill again. I had done that too much in the past, killing for my country. Killing because I was told to. Killing because I had grown to like it.<br>The abbot took me in, saw me for the broken soul that I was, and taught me to seek the Lord‚Äôs forgiveness for all that I had done in the past. And over the years I had grown to believe that perhaps, just perhaps, I had managed to earn a little of that forgiveness.<br>That was then. And now‚Ä¶ Now I had killed once again. Killed an innocent girl. Ended her existence in this world because I felt that her being eaten alive would not serve God‚Äôs plan. Yet truthfully, how was I to know what God‚Äôs plan was? Who was I to second guess the ineffable? Did I truly do it for her? Or did I do it because I did not want to see her suffering? I buried my face in my hands, and waited for the end to come.<br>I am not sure how long it was before I noticed the soft blue radiance around me. I looked up in wonder, seeing a shimmering blue flame that hovered in the air in front of me. I reached out to touch it, and was astonished when it leapt towards my open hand, and nestled within my cupped palm. And then I felt it. I knew what it was. It was Lizzie. Beautiful, pure, innocent Lizzie. Her very soul was cupped in my hand. I felt no recrimination. I felt no hatred. I felt only her trust, and the simple all-encompassing love that only a child can possess. I smiled through my tears. Dear little Lizzie wanted me to know that I was forgiven, before the zombies came to eat me. I wiped my tears away with the back of my hand, and cupped the essence of Lizzie‚Äôs soul in both hands. I closed my eyes, and bowed my head in prayer.<br>‚ÄúYea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death‚Ä¶‚Äù My words were drowned out over the splintering of the wood around me. I closed my eyes, and thrust Lizzie‚Äôs soul upwards, wanting her to be free from here, not wanting her pure soul to be forced to watch me being eaten. I clasped my hands in front of me and finished my prayer. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.‚Äù I opened my arms wide, and waited for the end.<br>It was a moment or two before I opened my eyes again, wondering why I was not yet dead. The pure blue radiance of Lizzie‚Äôs spirit had changed to a deep red, and the zombies all around began to melt as it somehow began to rain inside the wreck of the building. I stood, staring around myself in amazement. This truly was a miracle. Or was it? Was this truly a divine miracle? Somehow I had always thought that the feeling would be different. This did not have the feel of God to it. No, it was different from that. Not God, but certainly... something. <br>As I stared around myself, wondering, the red glow began to fade from the air around me. It seemed as though the light began to pool onto the splintered wood that lay all around me. The light grew for a moment, pulsing, and then faded away completely. Though the glow was gone, not everything was as it had been before. Where there had been only splinters of wood, now there was a mask of some sort. Odd whorls and curls covered the surface in an intricate design that my eyes could not seem to follow. Staring at it made me slightly dizzy, yet I could not look away. It was as though those strange designs were some kind of message for me, instructions on what needed to be done.<br>I don‚Äôt know how long I stared at the mask, communing with‚Ä¶ something. But I did suddenly know when I was finished. Staring at the mask no longer hurt me. My confusion was gone, and my perceptions were sharp. I picked up the mask, and put it on. I knew my purpose. I was resolute.<br>The first aimless soul was drifting only a few meters away, and with my new abilities it was child‚Äôs play to reach out and grab it. The soul flowed up my arm, and settled into my mask, becoming a part of it. I knew, without looking at it, that a new whorl had appeared on its surface. The next one was slightly further away, but I reached it easily enough. The third was a much longer hike, but it was right where I knew it was. And then I sensed them, a whole town full of souls. I crested a dune and saw a town that was more of a walled fort than simply a town. I moved forwards, seeing all the souls within. It took me a moment to realize that these souls were still encased in flesh.<br>I walked towards the town, hearing the lookouts shouting about the horde on the horizon. They did not believe that they were strong enough to survive the night. In the last minute rush to close the gates I managed to get inside. I walked to the town square, drew water from the well, and collected other supplies that I somehow knew that I would need. And then holding aloft a rough shaped sword constructed from scrap metal I screamed out some words in a language that no human mouth had ever before spoken, and thrust the sword into the ground. There was a pulse of light, and a red radiance settled over the town. Cries of joy came from the walls, as they saw what I already knew. The zombies could not even pass through the radiance, let alone reach the walls.<br>They straggled in from all over town, a few at a time. They clutched makeshift weapons, but were too afraid to lift them. I stood in front of the Sword of Bokor, raising my hands in the air.<br>‚ÄúI bring the tidings of the Lord of Spirit. The bondage of your flesh is coming to an end. Give him your obeisance and he will grant you the protection that only he can bring. Kneel down and worship him!‚Äù<br>My words held power, and without hesitation they all bowed down. These few here would be my first disciples. They would go out, and spread the word, and we would free spirit from the bondage of the flesh. It would take time. We had to interact within the physical world, but eventually all would be freed.<br>I reached up to caress my mask, the mask created with the last of Lizzie‚Äôs essence. For a moment I almost felt as though I could hear a little girl‚Äôs tortured scream. But then I once again felt my Lord‚Äôs power rush through me, and felt the rightness of my actions.<br>There was much work to be done.</p>

They were alone.<br>‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù, meekly huffed the first man.<br>‚ÄúWell?‚Äù, sarcastically puffed the second.<br>‚ÄúGrunt‚Äù, sadly grunted the third man.<br>‚ÄúFuck‚Äù quietly whimpered the fourth man.<br>‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù, repeated the first man, cautiously turning his head to meet the second man‚Äôs glare, ‚Äúwhat now?‚Äù The second man chuckled villainously.<br>‚ÄúNow?‚Äù, he asked, ‚Äúwe wait‚Äù.<br>*Grunt*<br>*Whimper*<br>‚ÄúFor?‚Äù asked the first man cautiously. The second man let out another malicious chuckle.<br>‚ÄúWhat else‚Äù.<br>*Grunt*<br>*Whimper*<br>‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù, pleaded the first man, ‚ÄúNo no no no NO!‚Äù. He stood up in defiance, eyes consumed in panic.<br>‚ÄúSit down and shut up‚Äù, ordered the second man, his voice suddenly humourless.<br>*Grunt*<br>*Whimper*<br>‚ÄúYes sir‚Äù the first man muttered in defeat.<br>‚ÄúGood‚Ä¶‚Äù, said the second man more lightly, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a good life haven‚Äôt we?:<br>*Grunt*<br>*Whimper*<br>‚ÄúBut sir‚Ä¶ Why? Why now? We can still run‚Äù, pleaded the first man desperately.<br>‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù responded the second man mockingly.<br>*Grunt*<br>*Whimper*<br>‚ÄúAnywhere‚Ä¶‚Äù exhaled the first man,<br>‚ÄúDrop it. And don‚Äôt worry boys, it won‚Äôt take long. I even have some marshmallows and sticks to pass the time‚Äù, jeered the second man.<br>*Grunt*<br>*Whimper*<br>‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been planning this day all along haven‚Äôt you old man?‚Äù, the first man questioned sadly.<br>‚ÄúHush now boy. And listen. We have a fire. We have marshmallows.

Does anyone have a tale to tell?‚Äù<br>*Grunt*<br>*Whimper*<br>‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù admitted the fist man meekly.<br>‚ÄúWell then I‚Äôve got one‚Äù, confirmed the second man, eye‚Äôs full of glee.<br><em>‚ÄùThere is a ruin out in the wastes, farther out than any sane man would venture. It is said that a wise man lived there, giving wisdom to those who risked the sun and sand for some of his knowledge. The man‚Äôs name itself is unknown, but what is known is that the man is mad. Many a mad men met their end attempting to meet the mad wise man. A nameless child made his way to meet the mad wise man, in hopes that the mad wise man could tell him who his parents were. The nameless child had no memory of mother or father, and had no other cause in life but to find out who they were and to learn who he was. And so the boy left his cardboard box house in the small town of Grotesque Thatch with his pet pig. The nameless child thought it unfit to name his pet pig, he having no name himself, and so never referred to it by anything. The nameless child strapped up everything he owned to his pet pig, two rations of water, a tasty steak, and a staff; and after stealing one last jaffa cake from the withering old woman whose shack he lived behind, he rode north, on the bag of his pet pig. They traveled five days without break before coming across their first ruin. A burnt out schoolhouse. The nameless child dismounted his pet pig, which after being ridden for five days took the opportunity to fall over and slip into sleep. The boy approached the scorched entrance cautiously. The old woman had told him stories of monsters that lurked in such dark places. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù No answer. The nameless child whistled to his porky friend, and entered the poorly lit place. The school was only one room, with wooden rubble scattered across the floor, but light only entered through the entrance and the sides were completely engulfed in shadow. His pet pig cautiously followed the nameless child into the eerie room, grunting nervously. The nameless child tightened his grip on his staff, slowly scanning the darkest parts of the room from the little lit spot from the entrance. The nameless child‚Äôs pink pal oinked and curiously approached the darkest corner of the schoolhouse. The buy felt a shiver of worry as he followed. As he left the light he saw clearer in the dark, and what he saw mad his knees tremble. A humanoid figure slumped in the darkest corner where his fat friend headed. The nameless child‚Äôs pet pig sniffed it‚Äôs boot. The figure was bulky and still. The boy poked the figures head with his staff gently. Nothing. His pet pig oinked and nudged the figures arm. Nothing. The boy reached out to feel the strangers weirdly flat face but all at once the figure burst to life and snatched the child‚Äôs arm. It stood up on its feet, it‚Äôs joints clanking as they shuffled. The child felt no warmth of the strangers grip. Only cold steel. The child dropped his staff, and stared in horror as the stranger looked down upon him. The stranger dragged the child into the corner, switching spots so that the child could not run. The boy shook all over, tears streamed down his face. The stranger lifted his clunky arms so that its cold steel clamps could grip its head. The child watched as the stranger lifted, pulling its head AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!‚Äù</em></p><p>The first, third and fourth man shot up and screamed. The second man burst into gleeful laughter. The third man burst into tears and sat back down, crying into his hands. The fourth man sat back down and picked his oozing marshmallow from the sand. The first man cussed and sat back down last.<br>‚ÄúThat was cruel old man. You‚Äôre vile‚Äù.<br>‚ÄúIt was just a joke. The story isn‚Äôt over, and we should hurry, we don‚Äôt know how much time we have left‚Äù. The second man sighed.<br>‚ÄúFine then old man, pass me another marshmallow‚Äù.</p>

                <p><strong>Fun In The Sun Part 2</strong></p><p><em>‚ÄùThe child watched as the stranger lifted, pulling its helmet off. The stranger backed up, into the center of the room where the boy saw him for the first time. The stranger had short blonde hair and ghostly blue eyes. The stranger was coated in poorly forged pots pans and cans, forming a suit of sketchy armor. The stranger stared wildly at the boy, his eyes darting between him and the pig. After a few seconds he commanded, ‚ÄúBoy, come closer so I can see you‚Äù. His voice was clear and smooth. The child stayed glued to the wall. The man smiled calmly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok boy. I mean you no harm. You surprised me is all‚Äù. He still stayed stuck to the wall, his heart pounding so fast his whole body throbbed with it. The nameless child‚Äôs pig let out a loud oink and positioned itself between the man and the child. The man saw this as amusing and let out a humble laugh. ‚ÄúHey boy. I mean it. I was just sleeping I woke up with some strange person in my face. Come on out of the darkness so we can talk face to face‚Äù. The nameless child moved past his pink pal and approached the stranger. The strangers knelt down to meet the child face to face. ‚ÄúHi there‚Äù.<br>‚ÄúH-h-hello‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAnd what are you doing out here by yourself little one‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI-I-I‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚ÄúCalm down kid. Nothing to be afraid of here‚Äù. The child took a deep breath, trying to control his heart rate.<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not alone‚Äù. The man raised an eyebrow and turned his gaze toward the pig.<br>‚ÄúNo you aren‚Äôt, hmmm. So what are you two doing all the way out here? Where are your parents?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for a man who can tell me that?‚Äù The man tilted his head.<br>‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that kid‚Äù.<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for the mad wise man out in the desert‚Äù. The man frowned, his eyes becoming a little darker.<br>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a fairy tale kid. He doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThe old woman said he does‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWell the old woman was wrong kid‚Äù<br>‚ÄúBut I have to find him. The old woman says he knows everything and if you find him he will answer one question you give him‚Äù. The man sighed.<br>‚ÄúSorry kid but there aint no man out there like that. Only the cultists‚Äù The nameless child fumed.<br>‚ÄúHe has to exist! I have to find him!‚Äù The man hung his head and stood back up onto his feet.<br>‚ÄúCan‚Äôt let you do that kid. You must be from Grotesque Thatch. It‚Äôs the closest town from here. I gotta take you back kid, people are probably worrying about you‚Äù The child grew furious.<br>‚ÄúNo one cares about me! All I have is with me here!‚Äù The child pointed at his porky friend, who took his cue to oink in defiance. The man sighed.<br>‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt last 3 days out there‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôve already been here for five‚Äù The man looked at the kid in surprise. His smile came back to him.<br>‚ÄúYou know kid. You remind me a little of myself when I was your age.‚Äù The man slumped the pack he carried off his back and let it thud onto the ground. A monsterous crash bellowed from the impact. The man unclipped the pack and ruffled through it, pulling out a serrated knife, a water ration, and some duct tape. ‚ÄúLet me see that twig you were poking me with‚Äù. The child went and fetched it from where he had dropped it and gave it to the stranger. The stranger used some of the duct tape to attach the serrated knife onto it, and then handed it back to the nameless child along with the water ration.<br>‚ÄúDo what you want kid. Just hear this. Avoid the crow cultists. Don‚Äôt listen to a word any of ‚Äòem say. You see any strange person wearing a bone necklace you run and hide‚Äù. The child nodded, and his pink pal oinked. The man walked back into his corner, slumped, and fell back asleep. The kid took the opportunity to steal a doggy bag out of the strangers pack before heading back out. The strange man giggled when he was gone.<br>‚ÄúHe may just succeed where I failed‚Äù.</em></p><p>‚ÄúHey old man‚Äù, asked the first man, ‚Äúdid you hear that just now‚Äù. The second man giggled.<br>‚ÄúHush now boy. Time is running out, they‚Äôll be here soon‚Äù. The first man frowned and shoved a burnt marshmallow into his mouth.</p><p><em>‚ÄùThe nameless chilf rode his pig out in the sands for 7 more days. They ran out of food and water on their sixth. He and his pink piggy pal discovered another structure on the seventh. It was a small stone crypt with it‚Äôs door long ago shattered and dispersed. The child dismounted the pig, and peered into the crypt. Inside were a steep set of stairs leading into almost complete darkness. Deep down the boy saw shadow of a dancing light. The boy took his spear off the back of his porky pal and together they descended into the smothering darkness. The farther they went the fouler the air became, and by the time they reached the end of the stairs the child‚Äôs eyes were watering. The room the child and his friend had entered into was a suppressing darkness. The walls, the ground, the ceiling, all were consumed in an impenetrable darkness. All the child could see was a fire sparkling in what could likely be the center of the room. Sitting with it‚Äôs back to the child was a man in a black dustcoat and weathered wide brimmed hat. The child approached the man with his spear extended. When the boy had his spear within a meter of the man, the man shrieked out a horrendous slur of laughter that chilled the boys blood. His pink pal grunted nervously and pushed in front of the child in a meek attempt to defend him. The man turned to face the boy, the fires light illuminated his back , but masked the mans front features from the boy. All the boy could see was the man‚Äôs grotesque smile and his sparkling eyes. ‚ÄúHello there child‚Äù, he giggled, ‚ÄúHow delicious that you would meet me here‚Äù. The boy kept his spear pointed at the man. The man took no notice and instead looked down at the boy‚Äôs pig. ‚ÄúMmm mmm mmm isn‚Äôt that a mighty morsel of pink you got there kid. If I weren‚Äôt full from this family I‚Äôd be suckling on his toes by now‚Äù. The child was horrified by the man.<br>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk to my friend like that!‚Äù<br>‚ÄúFriend? All friends are food kid.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt eat him I won‚Äôt let you‚Äù The man tilted his head back and let loose another gruesome bellow of laughter. <br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gunna eat ‚Äòim kid. I‚Äôm only messing with yah. I got plenty of food down here. You hungry? I got plenty to share‚Äù. The kid looked down at his porky pal to make sure he was all right. His friend was shivering but still stood against the man. The man walked off into the darkness, leaving the child and his pink pal alone by the firelight. The child moved closer to the fire, fearing what may be lurking in the veil of darkness. The man returned several minutes later with a large wet sack. He reached inside and pulled out a mangled piece of flesh, and handed it to the nameless child. ‚ÄúGo on kid, toss it on the fire‚Äù. The child did as he was told, putting the slimy slab of meat on the fire. It sizzled and popped and spit and schlurped. The man handed the kid the slimy sack and said, ‚Äúfor you kid. It takes a brave soul to come down into these depths. You are burning. I can smell it on yah‚Äù. The child sat down across from the man, his pink pal wobbled over and rested it‚Äôs head on his lap. The man kept his face in the shadow of the fire. ‚ÄúSo kid. Have you ever seen it?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSeen what sir?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me sir. I ain‚Äôt ever earned that title.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúO.K.‚Äù The man grinned, his smile expanding from ear to ear.<br>‚ÄúSo kid, have you seen the eye in the sky?‚Äù The child shook his head. The man nodded. He licked his lips and turned, revealing his heavily scared face to the boy. It was smothered in cuts and blood. His lips were cracked, his hair melted to his face. He was disgusting. ‚ÄúListen to me child and listen closely:<br>‚ÄúIt's all in the eye of the Demon God,<br>So hide in the light of day!<br>Beware, don't stare at the Demon God,<br>At night, you better stay away!‚Äù<br><span class="tid_sideNote">Poem By: TheUltimateWarlord </span><br>The boy stared at the man. His eye‚Äôs full of awe and terror. The man hid his face in the shadow again.<br>‚ÄúRemember those words child. And fear the crow. Take sanctuary here anytime, I have to leave soon. The King calls. I‚Äôl show you the way out when you‚Äôre done cooking that meat.‚Äù The child thanked the man and did as the man said, taking hunks of soggy flesh from the bag and cooking them piece by piece. The man watched, giggling and muttering every now and then. When the boy was done the man stood and put his hand on his shoulder, leading him to the staircase.<br>‚ÄúGoodbye kid. And remember my words!‚Äù The kid nodded and ascended the stairs, his pink pal in tow, both silently agreeing to never go down another flight of dark decrepit stairs.‚Äù</em></p>

The second man nodded.<br>‚ÄúTook him long enough I surprised he made it this long with the amount of blood he lost.‚Äù The first man scowled at the second man. The third man grunted sadly. <br>‚ÄúIs the story almost over?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMaybe you should shut up and find out you ungrateful bastard‚Äù. The first man sighed.<br>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre out of marshmallows‚Äù.</p><p><em>‚ÄùThe boy rode his pink pal without water for three days before finding an abandoned well. He and his porky pal camped there the night, drinking as much water as they could and bottling as much as they could carry. But when the child awoke the next morning he realized his dire mistake. Water was the most valuable commodity of the sands, and such a store of water would have been found and fought over by many before him. He awoke in a wooden cage being carried by two burly men. He looked around to find a caravan of people, all wearing no shirts, all wearing bone necklaces. The strange armour wearing man‚Äôs words rung in his head, his warning against the bone necklace crow worshipers. And even the strange fiend he met in the tombs warned against the crow. The child looked around for his pink pal but couldn‚Äôt find him.<br>‚ÄúHey Deagon. The boy‚Äôs awake‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIs he now‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYah‚Äù. The two men chuckled.<br>‚ÄúHey Luth!‚Äù, one man called to another who was walking beside them, ‚ÄúGo tell Stefany the boy‚Äôs awake‚Äù. The third man nodded and ran off. The child observed the caravan, he had never seen so many people before, all wearing no shirts and all wearing bone necklaces, men women and children, there must be hundreds of them all walking in a line. A few minutes later the third man returned with a young woman. She smiled at the nameless child, her eye‚Äôs large and blue, her teeth clean and white. She was beautiful. ‚ÄúHello there boy. How are you feeling‚Äù. The child squirmed in his cage.<br>‚ÄúWhere is my friend?‚Äù The woman frowned.<br>‚ÄúWho are you talking about dear?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMy pig? Where is she?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúOh dearie. That beast was put down. It bit poor Deagon, it was evil. We left it‚Äôs body for the glorious crow.‚Äù The nameless child felt tears well up through his eyes. Stefany smiled calmly and moved her hand to his cheek. ‚ÄúShhh dearie it‚Äôs ok. All your pain will be over soon. The CrowCaller has chosen you for something very special‚Äù. The nameless child continued sobbing. Stefany kissed him on his forehead and began caressing his hair. The two men stopped and put the cage down. They opened up the cage door and allowed Stefany to pick the boy up and cradle him over her shoulder. Her warmth calmed the nameless child and he buried her face into her shoulder. A booming voice echoed throughout the caravan, ‚ÄúWE STOP HERE FOR NOW FOLLOWERS! THE CROW IN ALL HIS GLORY DEMANDS US ANOTHER CELEBRATION! TONIGHT WE GIVE HIM ANOTHER GIFT, AND HE SHALL GUIDE US AS HE HAS ALWAYS! ALL HAIL THE CROW!‚Äù A single voice from every man woman and child boomed ‚ÄúALL HAIL THE CROW‚Äù! The boy lost track of time in the woman‚Äôs arms. He felt her carrying him somewhere, but he did not know where. All he felt was her gentle hands caressing his back and her soothing voice humming in his ear. The nameless child had never been held like this before, he had never known his mother, never known his father, and the old woman who had raised him was brittle and weak. The nameless child kept his eyes closed and let Stefany‚Äôs embrace soak up all his fear, all his worry, all his pain.<br>‚ÄúI have the child master. When will the ceremony be?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhen the setting sun kisses the sand‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI see‚Äù<br>‚ÄúUntil then Stefany, the boy is yours to care for‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThank you master‚Äù<br>The boy did not understand their words. He tightened his grip on Stefany‚Äôs bare chest and snuggled his chin over her shoulder. She cooed to him, lulling him into a trance-like state. The child cried and cried letting everything pour into Stefany, occasionally snatching words and conversations.<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶so lucky‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶crow‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶he is so young. How did he make it this far all by‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú..when is the ceremony?‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶he‚Äôs perfect‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶jealous‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶beautiful‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶kind‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶Raven King psycho‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶monster‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶he‚Äôs just a kid‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶name‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶lucky bugger‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶his swine put up one hell of a fight‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶Grotesque Thatch‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶he reminds me of‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶sack of human‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>‚Äú‚Ä¶another one got in yesterday, killed‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>The nameless child awoke in the woman‚Äôs arms, still being cradled and cooed. He whispered into here ear to let him down, and she complied. He clutched her hand tightly, observing his surroundings. The sun was setting quickly, almost touching the sands in the west. Stefany was with a group of woman, all looking happily down at him. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name little one?‚Äù asked one of the women.<br>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have one?‚Äù The women looked at him, shocked.<br>‚ÄúWhere are your parents?‚Äù asked another.<br>‚ÄúI never met them.‚Äù Again the women looked at him in shock.<br>‚ÄúWho is taking care of you?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúMy pig‚Äù The women looked at him full of empathy.<br>‚ÄúPoor child, having been stolen by an evil swine away from his family at childbirth. It‚Äôs o.k. dearie, the monster is dead now‚Äù. The boy opened his mouth to protest but a man behind him interjected before he could.<br>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time Stefany‚Äù All the women smiled warmly and shook the boy‚Äôs hand and kissed his forehead before letting Stefany lead the boy after the man. Her hand calmed his fear as he noticed everyone staring and smiling at him as he passed, falling in behind him and following the man and Stefany to wherever they were leading him. Stefany and the man brought him to a large altar where a shirtless man wearing a bone necklace, a gass mask, and a wide brimmed hat that had a medal stating ‚ÄúSherrif‚Äù on it stood. The man gestured Stefany forward and she brought the nameless child up ad sat him on the altar. The man nodded to her, in which she kissed the child on the forehead one more time, quietly wished him good luck, and skittered off into the growing crows.<br>‚ÄúFOLLOWERS OF THE CROW! HERE ME NOW! THIS YOUNG BOY WAS FOUND DRINKING FROM THE WELL THE CROW CONJURED FOR US! THE CROW HAS BROUGHT THIS CHILD TO US TO TAKE INTO OUR OWN! WE CELEBATE JOINING ANOTHER WITH US IN OUR QUEST FOR THE PROMISED LAND!‚Äù The people cheered, the child frowned. The masked man‚Äôs voice was so loud it was giving him a headache.<br>‚ÄúFOLLOWERS OF THE CROW! THIS BOY HAS HAD MORE MISFORTUNE IN HIS SHORT LIFE THAN MANY OF US HAVE IN OUR OLD ONES! THIS BOY NEVER NEW A MOTHERS LOVE, NEVER NEW A FATHERS PRIDE, THIS BOY IS MORE WORTHY THAN ANYONE HERE TO BE THE NEXT GIFT TO THE ALMIGHTY CROW? DOES ANYONE CHALLENGE MY DECISION TO GIVE THIS BOY THE ULTIMATE GLORY A FOLLOWER CAN BE REWARDED?‚Äù The crowd shrieked in approval.<br>‚ÄúTHEN LET THE CERAMONY BEGIN!‚Äù The child‚Äôs head throbbed from the noise, he was scared and confused, he wanted to be back in Stefany‚Äôs arms. He looked into the crowd for her and saw her smiling at him. This calmed him and he looked at the masked man. ‚ÄúCongratulations kid. Only the most worthy of us get to meet the crow‚Äù. The opened his mouth to ask the man what he meant but an unholy light burst in the distance, blinding the boy and knocking him off the altar. A second of mute white passed and then it was as if the hands of god had come together, an unearthly clap shattered the silence and smothering the boy. The boy was consumed by the light and noise, completely and entirely‚Ä¶‚Äù</em></p>

The moving metal box had dusty glass windows he could look out at. Not like there was anything to look at, only the endless sands. The boy took observation of the inside of the metal box. It was dirty with snack wrappers littering the ground and empty bottles of alcohol. Beside him sat two strange men and across from him sat a third even stranger one. At the front of the metal box sat two even stranger looking men.

                <p><strong>Eighteen<br></strong> by <span class="tid_user tid_user_1823547 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1823547">Rosslessness</span></p><p>In the dusty town square the seventeenth tally mark was drawn in the sand. I can‚Äôt remember which of us started this tradition, but every day since a line had been drawn in the sand.</p><p>That‚Äôs all this town was; a simple line in the sand. We had decided that for once, the zombies would fear us, and declared that they would never truly beat us if we were united. None had crossed our threshold since.</p><p>On this very spot, over two weeks ago, we had named our little scrap of civilisation, The Fierce Monolith. At the footing of a half built watchtower I had signed up to the town register with my friends. We were strongest when we were together, and we had met other likeminded groups in the wastes.</p><p>We had done well and above me now great monuments to our cooperation loomed. There were rusting walls within walls to frustrate even the most determined attacker. Drilling rigs and search towers creaked and swayed awkwardly in the dry air. The gallows twisted idly, thankfully unused, save as a warning.</p><p>We had hit the swarming zombies with a renewed strength, knowing and trusting that others had our backs. Heroic rescues and feats of bravery had given us the will to drive the hordes back to the horizon.</p><p>At nights the winds had risen and reshaped the desert unveiling new treasure for us to reclaim. Our bellies were full and our spirits high. For the first time in many a town I felt the flicker of hope in my heart. Our collaboration was the strongest force in this damned world.</p><p>Even tonight I knew that wood and iron, bolts and tape would be stronger than teeth and claw. The defences would hold and the ravenous throng would wash across them like waves against the cliff.</p><p>But all was not right. Attrition had taken its toll. Ill-advised camping trips, malevolent infections, even suicides had weakened us. My friends were long gone, consumed as brave watchmen, or lost in abandoned bunkers. Slowly, painfully, one by one they had returned to the great desert.</p><p>Then there was the other problem, which was that the water was all gone.</p><p>Well, almost.</p><p>Here, in the square is a battered leather flask. Its original owner is a mystery. It‚Äôs far older than the town, stoppered with cork and wrapped in a dirty rag. As I lift it in my rough hands I can feel the weight shift as the liquid sloshes around inside.</p><p>Who brought this with them? I cannot remember anyone ever showing me it before. Is it a trap? Is it poisoned? Why wasn‚Äôt it placed in the bank like the others? As the sun rises over the battered walls I‚Äôm joined by the other survivors of this once great town.</p><p>Three figures approach from the shanty town of personal huts. I hastily return the ration to the ground. I don‚Äôt want to be accused of stowing supplies away for my own personal benefit. I have no idea how the others will react.</p><p>Four of us stand in a loose circle around the thing. All of us are from different coalitions. Here with me stand Bragg, Gofer and Michaels. All of us are little more than strangers to each other. There‚Äôs been little time for group bonding.<br> <br>We‚Äôre all so thirsty, our sunken eyes and rasping voices betray the fact we haven‚Äôt drunk in days. I had been resigned to my death this morning, but even the thought of gulping down the cool, clear water gives me new energy.</p><p>Bragg is the first to speak, pointing a shaking hand at the flask, he licks his lips and exclaims, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs been hiding THAT?‚Äù Even through his dry throat, the last word is a shout. Up to this point in town that‚Äôs been my overwhelming impression of him. He‚Äôs a loud mouth, short of temper and brash in his actions. His manic energy and spasms confirm what I‚Äôve suspected for a while. He‚Äôs hooked, no doubt on that small cache of Hydratone that vanished from the bank last week. He seems to be the embodiment of bad decisions. His arms are streaked with scars, his teeth misshaped or missing. His boots are untied, the laces ragged. It‚Äôs impossible to ignore the fact his uniform is missing an entire sleeve. I wonder how normal he had looked at the founding. Was he there when I signed my name? I don‚Äôt remember him.</p><p>Gofer walked slowly around the ration, before crouching down, his head tilted to one side. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶.,‚Äù he slurred in his southern drawl,‚Äù it seems we‚Äôre not dead yet.‚Äù <br>Gofer was a tech. His uniform was missing both sleeves, but unlike Bragg‚Äôs ragged uniform, he had unstitched his. Here was a man who always wanted his sleeves rolled up. He scratched his tidy beard with the palm of one hand. He looks first at Bragg, then at Michaels before staring straight at me. Then bluntly, he asks, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶. Who gets it?‚Äù</p><p>In my mind Gofer was a true hero. He‚Äôd saved me on the third night, dragging me back to town when I had become lost and desperate. He‚Äôd found the hacksaw that still hung from his utility belt. Without his knowledge this town would have been torn asunder a week ago. As the casualties started to mount he was steadfast, level headed. He always spoke calmly, presenting solutions, solving problems. I was proud we had helped build this place together. I almost regretted spending so much time outside. I would have liked to known him better. I knew I could have learned a great deal from him if I‚Äôd ventured into his workshop more often.</p><p>Then suddenly, a dark thought crossed my mind.</p><p>If I could just grab the water, I could run. If I reached the gates, I could hide in the desert. If I could hide for just one night, this town would be mine.</p><p>If‚Ä¶</p><p>Michaels raised his hand. It was a small gesture but in that empty town it drew my attention back to the moment.</p><p>Michaels was small, maybe half the height of Bragg. I don‚Äôt even remember who he used to hang around with. He had medium build and a very plain face. If anyone was doomed to drift into the background it was him. The only reason I even remember him was because he‚Äôd built his house next to mine. Every morning after the attack I‚Äôd greet him with a nod and ask him how he was. He always smiled at me and replied, ‚ÄúSurviving‚Äù, before setting out to work. Three days ago he had handed me my last drink after dragging in that final jerry can. I remember thinking the town needed more residents just like him, and less like Bragg.</p><p>He stammered, looking at the floor, ‚ÄúH‚Ä¶.ow do we decide?‚Äù</p><p>Round and around we went, shouting and threatening, reasonable and calm, serious and sarcastic. All day we sat there, watching each other like hawks. We all realised that each of us was too weak to take it from the other three. By mid-afternoon the madness had overtaken me. For some strange reason I felt it was hilarious that at least three of us were wasting our final hours in the remains of this great town community, squabbling over something so small.</p><p>Gofer suggested we drew straws. Bragg immediately rejected this, arguing a tech could easily guess how long each straw was. I suggested a lottery, but no one could decide who would draw the number. We couldn‚Äôt think of a way to trust each other.</p><p>The late afternoon sun beat down, burning my neck as we wasted hour after hour. We were wasting our final moments together over petty squabbles.</p><p>I felt myself drifting in and out of the rambling conversation. I remember closing my eyes and thinking this was the end. But, then it happened.</p><p>I heard a gentle thud, as something hit the sandy ground. Opening tired eyes I saw the water ration, dropped between my legs.</p><p>Michaels stood over me, rubbing his neck as he coughed to clear his throat. Then he turned to the others and pointed at me. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my friend. He can have it.‚Äù We stared at him in stunned silence for a long moment. The silence was a welcome moment of calm. Michaels looked into my confused eyes and said, ‚ÄúKeep on surviving,‚Äù before walking back to his hovel.</p><p>‚ÄúNo‚Äù hissed Bragg as he pulled himself shakily up onto one knee. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mine. ‚Äú With a low growl he staggered to his feet. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs mine. You can‚Äôt have it. You. Can‚Äôt.‚Äù He raised his hands and stepped awkwardly forward. ‚ÄúMine!‚Äù</p><p>He made it four hurried steps before Gofer was on him. I have no idea whether he was stopping him or fighting him for the water. As dusk fell, with its merciful coolness all I could see was their silhouettes as they grappled and twisted. I sat there watching the two gladiators‚Äô clash, first Bragg swinging a twisted plank, then Gofer grabbing a pathetic penknife from his belt and slashing wildly. In the end with a roar like an enraged tiger Bragg slammed the tech bodily into the half-finished spikes outside his own workshop. We should have finished them today, but we were too selfish.</p>

                <p>With Gofer still twitching awkwardly in his death throes, Bragg turns and begins dragging himself back towards me. He limped awkwardly and blood covered his exposed arm. He looked like a bloodied Viking intent on murder. I was too afraid, and too exhausted to move.</p><p>He dropped to the floor in front of me. Picking up the flask in one hand, he grinned at me, proud of his victory. But, all was not well.</p><p>The pathetic, stubby penknife was still stuck into his wrist, and thick dark blood ran down his arm. His hand was slick with blood, and try as he might, the sealed flask wouldn‚Äôt open in his weakening grip. Tears of frustration rolled down his face and as he held the final ration close to his chest he buckled, falling to the ground, dead.</p><p>As if on cue, from outside the zombies began groaning. I blinked and tried to focus. Grabbing the flask I gripped the cap in my teeth and pulled as hard as I was able. It opened with a loud pop in that darkened town. In swift gulps I swallowed the water as quickly as I dared, ignoring the death around me as the cool liquid ran down my throat. I felt alive again.</p><p>Reaching into my pack I took out my last few matches and with whispered prayers I burnt the two bodies. The thick smoke from the cooking flesh was blocking out the stars above me and I suddenly I felt so alone. I decided to sleep in the workshop. Walking home past Michael‚Äôs final resting place was too much to bear. Finally I understood the meaning of friendship.</p><p><span class="tid_strike"></span>-</p><p>When I awake the world is changed. Above my head the sun no longer beats down. As far as I can see is cloud. Thick and black, the entire sky looks angry, and as I walk back into the main square I hear a rumble of distant thunder.</p><p>In the dusty town square the eighteenth tally mark has been drawn in the sand. I can‚Äôt remember which of us started this tradition, but every day since a line had been drawn in the sand‚Ä¶.</p><p>Eighteen.</p><p>Eighteen lines in the sand</p><p>Now, suddenly, I know.</p><p>Turning around slowly I see Michaels, leaning against the gallows. Now I know why he kept so quiet, shunning the crowds. I understand why he returned with that jerry can, rather than using it himself.</p><p>He starts walking towards me.</p><p>Lightning splits the sky, earthing itself in the metal chain behind him. It explodes in a shower of white hot metal, but Michaels doesn‚Äôt even flinch. He just keeps on coming.</p><p>I shout at him over the rising storm. ‚ÄúWhy me? Why did you give it to me? Why am I last?‚Äù</p><p>The rain comes now, more than enough water for everyone. As the large drops hit Michaels his skin burns, but he ignores it. His eyes are locked on me. I know I'm going to have to fight for my life.</p><p>He‚Äôs now 5 foot away, and in his quiet voice he replies, <br>‚ÄúBecause you were my friend.‚Äù</p><p>As the eighteen lines in the sand fill with water and begin to wash away, we lunge at each other‚Ä¶</p>

                <p><strong>My Friends</strong></p><p><em>Alone? Alone? I‚Äôm never alone. They‚Äôre everywhere, my friends. I can hear them singing. Singing and calling out for me, they‚Äôre beautiful chorus cheering for me to join them. The people I live with shun my friends, my family. They fear them. They hate them. I fear and hate the people for fearing and hating my friends. My friends fear and hate the people for hating them. They only want to embrace the people, and convert them. I know now we are all the best of friends. And tonight we meet again. I will show the love my friends have shown to me to the people who have shown nothing but fear and hate to us. Once we are converted we can all be friends. Then I will be alone‚Ä¶ Alone with all my friends. I can hear the people, smell their filth, see their disgust, taste their fear. They barricade the gates from the outside to keep my friends out. Shame on them, why can‚Äôt they understand. I try and try but they only hit me. They hurt me. So I must show them. The darkness has come. My friends are coming. Oh beautiful night entrances my friends, fills them with soul, and sends them to me. I giggle at thought as I approach one of the people at the gates. The gates are open. He stands and watches my friends approach, fear etched into his shudders. He turns and scowls at me. I smile at him and bow. He tells me to leave. I bash him over the head with one of his friend‚Äôs bones. Drugs took his friend, and I took what was left. The person grovels on the ground at my feet. I giggle at the thought. Soon they will all grovel. My friends are coming and they will all convert. They will all see the way they see and they will see me for what I am. I bash the man again and again and again. Raspberry filling comes out of his ears. At least that‚Äôs what mother called it. She had a little rhyme she used to sing me:<br></em><strong>‚ÄúRaspberry filling,<br>is coming out of me.<br>It looks like jello,<br>or chocolate ice cream<br>Raspberry filling,<br>awfully tastes like blood‚Ä¶<br>WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!‚Äù</strong><em><br>I miss mother. She left me alone. Alone with these people. How could she. But then I met my friends. They found me outside when I was very young, I went outside the great walls to find my mother. They picked me up, and brought me home. And their reward? The people slaughtered them all. The people are mad. The people are ignorant. But the conversion will make them happy. The conversion will make them see. The person at my feet stops moving. His chest rises and falls. Rises and falls. I feel his rugged face and kiss his cheek. My friends are almost here. Soon. Soon. Noise behind me. I turn to see a person running away. ‚ÄúDo not fear! Do not hide! All will be over soon!‚Äù The person returns with more persons. They all carry sticks and stones, perhaps to break my bones. I smile and pull out the bone. They beat me. I beat back. They grab me. I smile and sing. ‚ÄúMy friends are coming! My friends are coming!‚Äù The people hurt me. They hurt me bad. I stop singing. They put me in a big cage. I sit in the ekrupt gluten chair unable to move. I hurt too much to move. They drag my cage outside, in front of the gate. My friends are very close. The people don‚Äôt even take the time to spit and curse. They run back inside and close the gates. My friends rush past me and smash at the gates. My friends smash open my metal cage. One picks me up and carries me in his arms. I smile up at him. He smiles back at me. A few of mother‚Äôs little helpers slip out of my pocket. Little needles of clarity she left me in my tent, enough to keep my eye‚Äôs open all these years. With them I could see the beauty of my friends behind their rot. My friends lick me, they kiss me, they embrace me, they convert me.<br></em></p>

                <p><em>Endless, for too many, that is how the desert must seem. An endless land of sand and heat, the shuffling corpses of the undead, relics of times forgotten buried just beneath one‚Äôs foot‚Ä¶ But there is more to the desert and shuffling corpses of the undead than one would think, the shifting dunes tell stories and let us know where the things that many search for are actually hidden‚Ä¶<br>The man walked slowly, the rising sun hitting his back as he left quickly erased footprints in the sand that he walked upon. He wore an old, dark hood over his head that also doubled as a cape that he had wrapped around his body slightly. The land beyond the safety of the wall of the town were actually quite chill at this time of day, that would change as the sun would reach its peak ascent, and probably would change before that actually, but it didn‚Äôt matter to the citizen, his hood actually doubled as an insulator for the heat‚Ä¶ No need to try and waste the water rations on a shower, he spared a glance back at the town that wasn‚Äôt too far off, having to shield his eyes from the sun they had been hitting his covered back.<br>They were all rowdy, not that he hated their company, they were just too loud and celebration sometimes, and other times they were bitter and resentful of one another, drinking away their fear and pain, some even taking drugs‚Ä¶ They all tried different ways to occupy their minds from the terror and fear of certain death at being eaten alive. Whether they decided to bicker among themselves or play rather intricate games, it was none of his concern, as long as he kept his head down and didn‚Äôt cause any trouble, he was sure he was fine‚Ä¶ The only one like him was the odd fellow with a ‚Äòsurvival‚Äô book, apparently he was in the town for some time, and then one day he found the book and was gone for a whopping five days, many considered him dead and started to write something in the log, but he was seen that day coming back perfectly fine and much wiser about the dunes.<br>He was too weird, and too much of a hermit for the cloaked citizen, and thus, he turned away from his town and continued walking‚Ä¶ He didn‚Äôt always leave this early, he was a man of secrecy and had built himself drapes, and a lock so no one but him would see the nice, soft Mattress he had‚Ä¶ Although he didn‚Äôt sleep long, and not till the zombie attack was over really, he did sleep better than most and was content with just taking the time to read over his notes and work in the lab, build something for the town‚Äôs people‚Ä¶ The talk of someone improving their own house and being possibly hanged made him leave town though, he didn‚Äôt want to partake in something like that, wasting resources and deciding if someone should live or not‚Ä¶ That should be left up to random chance and probabilities‚Ä¶<br>He stopped not only his train of thought but his movement as well, and he glanced at a dune ahead. He had yet to explore this area, but just from being this close he knew there were zombies on the other side‚Ä¶ How many though? He lowered himself to a crouch on the ground, the distant moans sounding in his ears like the slight wind‚Ä¶ He counted in his head, and did so many times over, and came to the conclusion that there were five of them shambling about; perhaps one was a fool that had gone missing the night before? It didn‚Äôt matter, but he was going to check anyways.<br>He climbed over the dune, and, now at the top, was able to see that there was actually only four zombies instead of the previously estimated five, he could take these four on if he wanted, but he instead simply slid down and walked right past one, almost brushing shoulders. He was a ghost, invisible to them, and many questioned why. Many said it was because he smelt different‚Ä¶ They were wrong, he smelt just as bad as everyone else, but it was two things that saved him from the undead caring about him, he didn‚Äôt touch them, he covered as much as he could with his nasty looking green cloak, and he walked silently. They were not hound dogs, although some could smell if he got too close, the one he had gotten close to had his nose apparently missing, he had to only worry about their other senses.<br>Now in the middle of the group, he sat down on the sand and took out a small notebook and a pen, starting to scribble notes down in it about the area. Many seen this as him studying the undead, which he sometimes did, but this was actually to take in account how much sand seemed to be where, if a hidden road was buried, and any almost gone drag marks made by the undead. These things told him how long the zombies had been here, where they had come from, and if there was a possible building nearby, something forgotten from the time before‚Ä¶ All of this.<br>He frowned slightly as he was able to trace the zombies from two directions, on the right of him, and in front. Ahead of him many more moans than before, it was almost an orchestra of noise from there‚Ä¶<br>And walking to their revealed a tangled mess of a building, it was hard to tell what it was, but it had foliage all over it and sand, to most, no one would be able to tell what it was‚Ä¶ The nine or so corpses walking around it also discouraged anyone from getting near it, but not this man, this cloaked man merely shrugged at the zombies and walked closer to the buried building. He weaved his way past zombies and odd sand piles before coming to another crouching stop by the building, taking out his notebook and starting to scribble down notes. The size of the building and the shape, the parts of the sine he could see, maybe a few things that he could see past the foliage like labeled bottles‚Ä¶ It was obviously a store, maybe a medical one? He got up started walking around it, sometimes there were clues on the side of the buildi-The hood came off and the branch scratched his face slightly.<br>Instantly he whipped around, muttering a curse at himself for being too close to the building and getting his hood knocked off by an old dead branch, it didn‚Äôt matter, if his hood came off and he was near any zombie, they‚Äôd know, and soon enough, they circled around him and began moaning even louder. The rotting meatbags would attack unless he got closer to them, it was odd, but they only attacked at one time of the day‚Ä¶ But sadly for them, they were circling around a citizen that always came prepared, he knew the land he traveled and understood the dangers, even considered a super<strong>hero</strong> with powers due to his ability to survive, and as he reached to his backpack that was hidden by the cloak, he pulled out something he was sure the town wouldn‚Äôt miss for a little bit, he‚Äôd give it right back once he returned‚Ä¶<br>It didn‚Äôt matter if it was a bloodied chainsaw or not after all.</em><br>This, this is something I said I'd write eventually and is about the <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_ranger.gif" alt=":hordes_eclair:" class="tid_ico">, I hope it wasn't complete rubish.</p>

                <p><strong>The Watch.</strong><br>By <span class="tid_user tid_user_1764107 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1764107">Colette</span></p><p>The moonlight and the starry sky of midnight were the only lights our eyes could see. Almost blind, and facing a horde of monsters every night, the watchmen held their position. Like a phalanx of desperate citizens, holding their improvised weapons, and hoping they could bash the skull of a zombie without having to face their teeth. Everyone saw them as heroes, who risked their lives for the benefit of the town.</p><p>For me, it was not about the glory. Or about the survival of the town. I simply had no other choice. Killing three or four before getting killed myself was better than waiting for my death at home, hiding under my bed. Wielding a machete, I stood in front of the town's gates, waiting. I could hear them getting closer. Groaning madly as they approached.</p><p>One, two, three and four nights. I had survived all of those battles before. I had gotten use to the panic and chaos of a hectic battle against the army of the dead. But it never became any easier. Zombies feel no pain or fear. They strike without any hesitation, with no doubts on their mind. With no mercy or remorse, they don't stop until their hunger is satisfied.</p><p>The silence of the night was then replaced by the symphony of chaos. Screams and shouts of the survivors, who cursed and insulted their opponents as they desperately wielded their improvised weapons. The zombies just groaned and moved forward, in their reckless attempt to enter the town. It was easy to get disoriented in the chaos. I slashed at one of them, and the machete's blade separated from the handle. My only weapon broken, and nowhere to retreat, I knew there wasn't much for me to do. Going hand-to-hand with one of those zombies would be suicide.</p><p>But before I could even make a plan, I felt something grabbing my ankle, and I lost my balance. The zombie I had slashed was still alive. If a living corpse can be ‚Äúalive‚Äù, that is. I struggled with the creature, trying to escape from its grasp while I kicked its head with all my strength. Its hand was cold, and its rotten flesh was covered in sort of disgusting slime. But it was too strong. Another zombie saw me and approached. I knew that they would overwhelm me and kill me in any second. However, the zombie collapsed suddenly. A figure behind it had stabbed it with a knife, which remained lodged in the creature's skull. The figure, a man, then took the knife out of the corpse and stabbed the zombie that had grabbed me, killing it. I remained on the floor, confused and still in panic. But the zombies, turned back and started fleeing. The attack was over, and the survivors of the zombie army retreated to fight another day.</p><p>‚ÄúYou're always getting in trouble‚Äù, the man said as he helped me stand up.</p><p>‚ÄúThanks again‚Äù, I muttered.</p><p>That man was Adam. A person that I had met just the day I arrived in town. He had helped me more than once before. Although he wasn't appreciated by the town for his defiant attitude and disregard for the town's rules, he was a nice person. The only person I could have really call a friend.</p><p>One of the surviving watchman ran to our location, asking me if I was injured. I told him I was just fine. Three of the citizens in watch had not been as lucky as me, though. They had brought down a dozen of zombies before succumbing to the hordes. In town, around thirty zombies had managed to enter the houses and devoured three citizens. That was worrisome. Now only half a dozen citizens remained in town, including us, and the numbers of zombies seemed to increase exponentially every night. We were in trouble. With nothing to celebrate, I walked to my home in silence.</p><p>Dawn. The sun was rising in the horizon. I couldn't sleep that night. After my experience of the last night where I had almost gotten killed, I was unable to keep waiting. The town was going to collapse soon. Everyone was going to die.</p><p>I got up. I walked around in town. Our improvised collection of shacks was now almost empty. The hammering and working at the workshop had ceased forever. The construction sites were just collecting dust now. During my walk, I found a citizen outside. I didn't know him, but I had seen him in town a couple of times before. And instead of greeting me, he eyed me suspiciously before leaving in a hurry. Everyone seemed so suspicious now. With no people left to enforce the rules, there would be no justice anymore. Ironically, at the time when everyone needed to stand together, all the trust among us had been lost. We didn't know if there was any saboteur around us. We only waited for midnight for our demise.</p><p>A minute later, I felt someone patting me in the back, and I turned startled to see. It was Adam again.</p><p>‚ÄúOh, Sophie, where have you been?‚Äù, he asked. ‚ÄúI've been looking all over for you. Aren't you joining the expedition?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúWhat expedition?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúDidn't you hear? The survivors are planning an expedition to the desert. We need to find a good shelter. This town's a sinking ship, and we need to abandon it now‚Äù.</p><p>I sighed and turned away, and then replied:</p><p>‚ÄúI'm not going to dehydrate to death out there. I would prefer to stay and fight to the bitter end. Go and join them if you wish‚Äù.</p><p>‚ÄúBut Sophie... I can't let a friend stay like this.‚Äù</p><p>I walked away. I didn't care about friends. At that point, all the cooperation had been left behind. One had to take care of oneself, not relying on others.</p><p>Later that day, the silence was everything I could hear in town. Everyone had left on their expedition. I had been left behind. And I wondered if I had done the right thing by staying behind. Adam and the others would be killed by the desert in a matter of days, if the zombies didn't do their job first.</p><p>A few minutes before midnight I walked around the abandoned town, near the bank. The bank had been thoroughly looted already, leaving me just a small knife as a weapon. Several thoughts whirled around in my mind. Thoughts about the impending end. Nobody wants to die. I hoped that a miracle would save me. But as I went out of the bank and saw a figure standing in front of me, I knew my odds of survival had been reduced dramatically.</p><p>It was a familiar face. One of my neighbors. The same suspicious person I had seen that morning. But there was something odd in him. His eyes were blank, like those of a zombie, and there was blood on his face. But he walked and moved like a normal person. He was holding a disgusting piece of rotting meat in a bone. The bone of a human corpse. He stared at me, with a maniacal smile, mumbling something. ‚ÄúI... Hungry‚Äù</p><p>The ghoul, as half-zombified persons are usually called, pounced on me with inhuman agility. I cursed myself for being so clumsy. I regretted about my decision of staying in town. And I understood that the half-eaten corpses we had found in the town in the previous days had been left behind by that man. I stabbed the ghoul with my knife repeatedly, but he didn't seem to feel any pain. I accepted my fate and stopped struggling. And the ghoul stopped moving.</p><p>A battery pierced the head of the ghoul. I looked up and saw Adam, holding his battery launcher. I thought it was an hallucination.</p><p>‚ÄúI tell you‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúYou're always getting in trouble, Sophie‚Äù.</p><p>‚ÄúI thought you were in an expedition‚Äù, I said, surprised.</p><p>‚ÄúI wouldn't abandon a friend‚Äù.</p><p>Before I could thank him, I heard some noises coming from the desert. The hordes were approaching. Adam loaded another battery into his launcher and helped me stand up.</p><p>‚ÄúWell, it's almost midnight. It's time to get on watch‚Äù.</p>

                <p>You know, they said that when things really went south, everyone was going to be equal, in the same conditions. However, some of us did have a bit of a head start.</p><p>It‚Äôs not that I was rich or powerful. I have my own ‚Äúrich and powerful‚Äù collection out back, mostly politicians and other people who made TV shows bad, but that‚Äôs beside the point. It‚Äôs just I was a bit more‚Ä¶ cautious.</p><p>You see, I never liked to run out of things. Well, no one likes to run short of toilet paper, that‚Äôs obvious. Except most people aren‚Äôt that worried about it. I was the guy buying toilet paper in wholesale, a year‚Äôs supply. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of shopping either, and being able to skip the mall for a whole year always felt good, so that was two birds with one stone.</p><p>Then there were other things, just to cover the rest of the basics. I never liked being sick, so I took preventive measures, just to avoid hospitals, which I didn‚Äôt like either. I didn‚Äôt like to be uninformed, so I had a TV which was sure to work, and a radio that wouldn‚Äôt break. I hated blackouts, so I also got a generator after that.</p><p>When I grew bored of canned food, I learned to grow some of my own, always underground so people or animals wouldn‚Äôt take it. People and animals, especially people, were always messing with each other. I didn‚Äôt like to be messed with, so I made it so they couldn‚Äôt get that far. And got what I needed in case they did get that far.</p><p>I didn‚Äôt like being alone, but I wasn‚Äôt the only one alone. We were alone together, at least as much as the radio allowed.</p><p>One day I didn‚Äôt like what I saw on TV. Other people said they never liked all of what they saw on TV, and they were right, I guess. But this was special, I thought, and I was right, I guess. Then I was alone, alone.</p><p>Then I wasn‚Äôt. Then They came. Not very talkative, sure, but still, it‚Äôs something, I thought. They wanted to mess with me, though. I guess my preparations against being messed with proved to be sufficient.</p><p>Then other people came. They didn‚Äôt want to mess with me, or at least not after they saw that I was ready for that. They asked for help, they weren‚Äôt ready to care for themselves. I helped them, so they helped back. And so I wouldn‚Äôt be alone.</p><p>And now I have it all. I am not alone, I eat the food I like, I get to see what I like on TV, and if not I have other things to do. No one messes with me, they don‚Äôt have the chance even if they want to. And I still have toilet paper.</p><p>It‚Äôs funny, how people react when I tell them my ‚Äúsecret‚Äù. One told me once ‚ÄúSo being a crazy paranoid works, huh?‚Äù It was funny. I laughed, and then I took him out the door, and showed him what was left of the last attempt to mess with me.</p><p>There were many of Them, stuck in holes, impaled in sharp sticks, with their legs or arms severed by blades. They all reached towards me and this one person, with whatever appendages they still had, even though they couldn't get to us.</p><p>Then I told him something I had read many years ago, a little phrase I always liked:</p><p>‚ÄúYou see, it isn‚Äôt paranoia when they <em>are</em> all out to get us‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

                <p><strong>Strangers</strong><br>by <span class="tid_user tid_user_1764107 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1764107">Colette</span></p><p>Another normal day in your everyday life. Yes. A day in the life in the modern world, where the only boundaries are those that people create for themselves. Imaginary lines around the world. A world where any place you can imagine is just a few hours away. Where everyone lives their lives in a permanent hurry. Then you enter a crowded subway station. You look around, but don't care about anything at all. All your plans and ideas are filling your mind. All the people around you are just silhouettes. Ghosts with no names or faces. Ghosts you will never see again. Ghosts that can't be trusted.</p><p>You board one of the trains, along with other thirty-nine persons, and take a seat. You finally notice the people around you. You see how they all are different. There are women and men. Some are wealthier and some are poor, some are older and some are young. But in the end they are just the same as you. They all have their own plans in their minds. And for them, you are just one of those nameless ghosts, destined to be forgotten soon. They won't trust you either.</p><p>Those days of the past are gone now, though. The modern world is now just a memory of the few people that can remember. A funny memory. Memories are always better in your head than they were in reality. However, now those of us who survived the collapse of society and found shelter in this arid desert are facing a similar scenario. I am in a small town, located in the middle of nowhere. Surrounded by thirty-nine persons. Thirty-nine strangers. Strangers trying to trust each other. Strangers trying to rely on each other to fight for the survival.</p><p>At first, it was difficult for me to accept it. It was impossible to know what kind of persons those strangers could be. Trusting a stranger is impossible, especially under these circumstances. What are their plans? What's in their minds? What are they plotting? Will they betray me if I dare to trust them?</p><p>Two weeks since I arrived to this town, and it all has been chaos since then. People said they did their best to organize the town and start building defenses. Useless. An useless effort. Yes, useless. Every night more and more zombies arrived, as if they sprouted from the ground. Growling, and attacking the defenses with all their strength. But people can be as stubborn as they are selfish. They kept fighting. They kept building defenses. Knowing that all efforts would be useless, I decided to sit and watch in safety, somewhat amused as the town started to collapse.</p><p>By seventh day since I had arrived, seven citizens had died already. Three went outside to the desert and never returned. Two were devoured by the hordes when a crack in the defenses allowed a small group of zombies to arrive in town. And the other two deaths had been much more... interesting.</p><p>One of them was Murray. Nobody knew where he had come from, or what was his last name. Nobody knew if Murray was his real name. A man of few words. He had worked as a carpenter in his younger days, even if his hair was completely gray by now. Despite his uncouth and unrefined manners, he was valued by the community for his skills Such construction skills were greatly appreciated by people.</p><p>Murray had a younger brother called Mark. Known in town as a lazy good-for-nothing man that spent his days sipping something from a bottle. Vodka, he used to say, but we didn't knew where or how he got his booze. People said that he had been like that since he had lost his wife and sons to the zombie hordes.</p><p>In any case, Murray and Mark were found dead at their home a that day. A shocking incident for everyone in town. The midnight horde had been repulsed, and everyone could breathe with relief for that night, thinking everyone was safe, just to find that both men had died in that night.</p><p>I heard the commotion that morning, and went to investigate. Entering, I saw one body lying on the ground. Murray. His skin had a bluish tone, and it was clear that his death had been very recent. There were no signs of struggle, but I saw the panic in his still open eyes. He had probably writhed in agony before succumbing to death. On the shack nearby, where Mark lived, his younger brother showed the same symptom. Everything indicated they had been poisoned. Nobody knew if it had been accidental or not.</p><p>Three days later. Midnight. The bell in the watchtower ringed. That was the alarm that indicated that zombies had been spotted, and that they would attack shortly. The town gates were locked, and the watchmen took their positions. The rest of the citizens knew what to do. Sit tight and hope for the best.</p><p>However, we soon understood that something had gone wrong. I heard the noise of the zombies pounding and scratching the barricades with their hands repeatedly. And the desperate screams of people being eviscerated and eaten alive. It only lasted fifteen minutes. Maybe less. But as the hordes retreated, everyone realized the magnitude of the disaster. Fifteen citizens. In their homes, only a half-eaten corpse remained. And then we realized why such catastrophe had happened. The town's gates had been unlocked at the last minute, leaving them wide-open for the zombies to enter. The word ‚Äúsaboteur‚Äù began to spread .</p><p>And then, the witch-hunt started.</p><p>The construction of an improvised gallows in the town's plaza was the first sign of ill omen. Followed by suspicion. Everyone was a suspect of those crimes. The possible murder of two citizens by poison, <br>and the act of sabotage that killed fifteen. People finally understood that strangers cannot be trusted.</p><p>Fear and panic took control of the city. A tightly-united group within the city, ten persons who had been in town more time than anyone else, took responsibility of starting a court of some sorts, in charge of delivering ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Justice in the form of executions and death.</p><p>The first victim was Greg. The man that transformed his home into an improvised kitchen, which he used to transform rotten, moldy and potentially deadly food into edible dishes. Trusted by the community, however, he could not explain why his kitchen had a smell of bitter almonds. The smell that came from two vials full of distilled hydrogen cyanide. Two other empty vials were found hidden in his home. He claimed he didn't know anything about that, and that since the lock in his house did not work, anyone could have entered to incriminate him. But everyone was too focused on looking for a scapegoat to give him the benefit of the doubt. Beaten and dragged to the town's plaza by an angry mob, he didn't stop yelling about how he was innocent until he died hanged by the neck.</p><p>Strangers. Strangers that you can't rely on. Strangers that you can't trust. They all look so similar. Eyeing you suspiciously all the time. What are they planning?</p><p>Second victim was Julie. She had forgotten to put the tools back in the workshop after she had finished. The sentence was quick. She had to die under the charge of sabotage.</p><p>The third was Scott, that same day. He was seen prowling around the town suspiciously before midnight. Clearly in a state of mental confusion. Nobody knew if he was drugged, or if his mind had collapsed because of the stress. But he was summarily executed as well.</p><p>The state of chaos stopped the construction of defenses, and everything's crumbling apart. It's been almost two weeks since I arrived in town. Three were hanged. Two were poisoned. Twenty devoured by the hordes. Ten went missing. Today only five of us remain. Four ghosts. Four strangers. Soon they all will be forgotten. I will kill them before they get me. I cannot leave the gates open again. The strangers are watching. I cannot let them find me. I have prepared the poison already.</p><p>The poison I mixed with Murray's food, and put on his brother's drink. Mark had stared at me several times. I saw the malice in his eyes. I killed him before he could harm me. I put the poison in his drink, which he must have shared with his brother. Collateral damage. Greg was planning to poison me, so I acted first. Self-defense. He was a nice scapegoat as well. I poured poison on Scott's water before he could discover me. I saw him when he went outside, as his mind started to deteriorate from the hypoxia as his life slowly left his body. Now I have four doses of poison left for four persons. Doses I will pour on the well tomorrow early. They will not discover me. They cannot hang me. Not me. Because I am special. I shall be the last one standing when all those dangerous strangers are gone. When all those people that wanted to harm me are gone. When I finally forget them. I can't wait...</p>

                <p><strong>The Grinning Skeleton</strong></p><p><em>I like to smile. I don‚Äôt know why everyone looks at me funny when I do. I quite like my teeth. Sure I‚Äôm missing a few, but I try to make the best of what I have. I don‚Äôt like when people look at me funny, it makes me feel funny. But I like it better than when people hit me. I used to have more teeth, but whenever I smiled people kept knocking them out. ‚ÄúWhat you smiling at faggot‚Äù, one would say, or ‚ÄúGet the fuck out of my face retard‚Äù, another would say. Then they‚Äôd knock out a tooth, but I never stopped smiling. No one will steal that from me. It‚Äôs all I have left, and even if they knock out all my teeth I‚Äôll still have my lips spread apart in a gummy grin. My smile is mine and mine alone. The house ‚ÄúI‚Äù own is shabby, but I‚Äôm told that it is mine. But sometimes people break in and go through all my stuff. I smile at them and ask why, but then they knock out one of my teeth. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre hiding something retard‚Äù, one would say, ‚ÄúWhere the fuck is it‚Äù, another would say. I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. I only have a few empty cardboard boxes in my house, and I am told they are mine. But when people come they always break open the boxes and look inside. I don‚Äôt feel like I own this house. I don‚Äôt feel I own these boxes. If I did people wouldn't be able to just come in, and people wouldn't be able to just break open my boxes. But I have my smile. My smile warms me, my smile comforts me, my smile means I still own something. But if I keep loosing teeth it will be very difficult for me to eat. When I went to the canteen and asked for my ration, Vincent tossed me a very hard to eat piece of bread. I told him that I was missing a few teeth and asked politely if I could perhaps have a softer thing to eat. He grew angry and knocked another tooth out. ‚ÄúI know you have a stash of food hidden in your house somewhere you chummy retarded bastard. Ask me for more again and I‚Äôl bash out every god damned tooth you have!‚Äù I smiled at him and left. I think I should start counting my teeth. That way I will know just how many I have left. I wish I could get those teeth back. I have every one I lost in my right pocket. I asked Doc if he could re-attach them and he laughed and told me that‚Äôs not how it worked. Doc was a nice man. I don‚Äôt know why anyone would kill him. After I talked to Doc I went back to ‚Äúmy‚Äù home and sat on one of my cardboard boxes feeling my teeth. A bunch of people came in and knocked out another tooth and began tearing open my boxes. ‚ÄúI knew it! I knew that retard was a druggie!‚Äù one said, ‚ÄúFuck that smile gave him away! It has to be the drugs that give him that fucking smile!‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what they were talking about. When they didn't find anything they beat me real bad and dragged me to the centre of town. Lots of people were yelling about hurting me and calling me bad names. Hark walked up to me and asked me what I was doing in Doc‚Äôs house. I told him. He sighed and talked to the men hurting me about my house. Then he picked me up and carried me home. The next day they found Doc‚Äôs medical stuff in Necro‚Äôs house. I smiled at him as he hung. He didn‚Äôt smile back. I never liked Necro, but I tried my hardest to smile at him whenever I could. It was hard, he always tried to make me frown. His brother Frankie died and I think he thought that I had something to do with it. Frankie liked to smile too, but only when he drank. And when he drank he hurt me. Then one day Frankie‚Äôs insides melted. Necro came into my house and knocked out another of my teeth. ‚ÄúWhat did you do to him you evil fucking retard!‚Äù he asked me. I smiled and asked him what he was talking about. He hurt me so bad I had to go to Doc‚Äôs house for a few days. I heard Hark tell Doc that Frankie had killed himself. He left a note saying how he had run out of drink and had nothing left to smile about. Poor Frankie. I hope I never stop smiling. As long as I stay active I can keep smiling. That‚Äôs how I see it. Being of use is fun, and having fun makes smiling easier. But I am running out of things to do. I used to help build stuff. That was REALLY fun. I cut wood for the big tower and I pounded metal flat for the wall. But when the gates broke open one night and the bad people came in I think people thought it was my fault. People came to my house in the morning and knocked out another tooth. ‚ÄúWhat have you done you fucking retarded creep!‚Äù one said, ‚ÄúYou've done it now fuckface!‚Äù said another. They dragged me to the middle of town and lots of people came and yelled mean things at me and demanded me to be hurt real bad. Hark came to me and asked me what my job was. I told him I pounded iron and cut wood. He sighed and carried me home. The next day Jannie was hung. Jannie was the metal-cutter. I pounded the metal into sheets, but Jannie took them and cut them too thin. Poor Jannie. She wasn‚Äôt too smart. Everyone said so, always had. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm smart either. I don‚Äôt like to think. Thinking makes me sad, and when I‚Äôm sad it hurts to smile. Luckily you don‚Äôt need to think to work. Hark wouldn't let me cut wood and pound metal after they hurt me that day. He told me to follow him around in the desert. It was fun, but not as fun as my old job. He would tell me to dig and I dug. He would tell me to kill and I killed. He would tell me to carry and I‚Äôd carry. My smile doesn't worry Hark. Hark never smiles, and when I asked him why not he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to, you smile for the both of us‚Äù. I miss Hark. I miss Jannie I miss Frankie. I miss Doc. A week ago Hark went into a building. He told me to stay and I stayed. He hasn't come out yet. A few days ago men came and asked me where he was. I told them and they went into the building. Yesterday more men came. They asked me where the other men where. I told them in the building. They went in with the others. I hope Hark comes out soon. It‚Äôs very hot out here. I sat down beside the door, but I can‚Äôt hear anything in there. I‚Äôm very hungry. I‚Äôm very thirsty. I‚Äôm very tired. Every day it gets harder and harder to smile. Hurry up Hark‚Ä¶</em></p>

After being averaged, for each round you participate in, you get a +10 and adds one <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_chat.gif" alt=":hordes_chat:" class="tid_ico"> per round you were in. For each round you win, you get +5 and adds one <img src="../../../../gfx/icons/r_winbas.gif" alt=":hordes_winbas_2:" class="tid_ico"> per round to your name for each one you won. This should make it easier for later contestants to win, but it's currently an experimental way of judging.

                <p>Congrats On SaucyemmettC for getting 2nd place! I loved each one of your stories, amazing man.</p><p>Also, I really think my score is... How you say... Fucked up. My first story shouldn't be counted because it <em><strong>wasn't</strong></em> intended to a contest entry, I was putting it down because of an earlier post, and having my work that I had spent some time and thought on judged so low because it didn't fit the theme of a current contest is highly insulting.</p><p>This bugged me when I was told it, as well as I, was being added into the contest.</p><p>Still, glad to see everyone's story's, the majority of them were a good read.</p>

Rocking my arms back and forth until they burned with stress I made logs into planks and planks into beams until the saw burned with stress.<br>We shared that. <br>That was ours.<br>Ours. <br>And so I took that saw to bed with me. To share my night of terror with the only thing in this god dammed town I can trust. <br>Rusty and bent, I heard those horrible groans and felt not fear while i held its mis-shaped handle, but I felt assured that tomorrow I would live and my saw would be here for me, for us all really, but especially for me. <br>Perhaps you are right, perhaps I should share old Rusty and Bent.

                <p>I remember the day when I first stumbled into this town, it was an unusually warm winter day. I had just fled from a small horde of zombies and had gotten a deep scratch along my left calf. I drudged in with my blood staining the mix of snow and grass. I noticed a few people a few people shuffling hurriedly about, when a man glanced in my direction. He rushed over to my side and called to others.</p><p>I must have fainted because the next thing I knew, I was lying in some sort of makeshift tent. I saw no one around so I got up. No sooner than that I felt a sharp pain, a kind of stabbing pain, in my left calf where I presumed I had been scratched the day before. I looked down and saw a reasonably clean bandage, it was cleaner than the rest of the tent, wrapped around my calf. I managed to hobble around a bit and see the man who had saved me. He was around 30, with broad shoulders and the look of a person who was ready for the zombie outbreak. He had a short beard and relatively short hair, it wasn't as everybody had a sharp pair of scissors to cut hair with. I went up to him and asked where I was. "You're in the 'Asylum of Drunks', or at least, that's what we call this place." After thanking him for saving my life and engaging in a rather short conversation about how he dressed my wound, he excused himself to go fetch wood in the world beyond the gates.</p><p>For the next few days, I couldn't do much, so I stayed "home" to rest. When I felt like I was ready to go help out with placing spikes to ward off the zombies, I had grown to like most of the 30-odd citizens of the town. I learned a few tricks as well, for example, I knew how to tell if water was drinkable or not, and also where to look for materials in the world beyond the gates. When 5 or so days had passed, I decided to take of my bandage. By then, my scratch was healed to the point where I could do everything I could do before, except for running, I still couldn't run that fast. I stuffed my bandage in my bag and went exploring. And so it went for many days, I would fold the bandage neatly into my bag before heading out. It wasn't for any particular reason other than to give myself something to do, but after the 10th day in the town, I started worrying about forgetting the bandage at home.</p><p>What would happen if I left it at home? Would it be easier for the zombies to find me? Would they attack more viciously? These questions were haunting me day and night, so I carried the bandage everywhere I went, even inside the town. Others thought I was crazy but so what? I loved the bandage, from it's tattered and ripped look, to it's bloodstains and green-ish tints. I loved it's holes and loose threads, as much as I loved my mother. It saved my life, everything I have is because of it. The only feeling I have in this bleak time is fear, but not fear of dying, fear of my bandage being taken from me. Lost. Separated. I am obsessed with it. I need it. It has come to define me, for without it, I am nothing. It will stay in my bag until the day I die. If such a time, god forbid, when my bandage is no more, I will have nothing to live for, to live to. I will have no will to carry on, to drudge as I had done before. The bandage is me.</p><p>~The bandage<br>Macs96</p><p><span class="tid_wspoil">Hope you guys enjoy my very first Die2Nite related story.

                <p>[Carved into the back of a piece plank, an old story unfolds withered by the sands of time, and a bit from the desert. It lay, words tended with care as each was made with what seemed like a pen knife, dull and shallow though stained with a crimson substance that appeared to be smeared across the top in a light film.]</p><p>Pine...</p><p>That was the smell that comforted me...</p><p>The scent that drove me on night after cursed night...</p><p>This... is my confession...</p><p>They told me it was only for decoration, they could split it in half for fire, but would you cut apart a friend for such a silly thing? He was my diary, the person to confide in, even if he wasn't a person per se. As the day came to an end, my weary head hitting the soft folds of a coat that I had taken off a resident that had died a few nights ago, there sat my log. I had named him William in the days to come. As the zombie horde came each night he was my protector, my guardian. Cold nights he would share my blanket under the star filled night as our talks, though one sided, filled me with hope for the next sunset to come a little slower as I made haste with my scavenging trips always to come home to its finely sanded curves.</p><p>Like clockwork every day passed, the horde moaning against the wall once midnight came, the people buzzing like ants once the day broke. Like clockwork the gates opened and closed in a disturbing rhythm that made my head pound in such a way that only cyanide, with a side of red wine could cure. My days were lonely, spending most of it in the harsh winds of the wastes, spending the rest in the cold comfort of my tent, not even a welcome as I poured my treasures of the day into the stockpile that we had made in the middle of town.</p><p>It wasn't till my second day of gambling my life away to bring us one more day to live, going into the zombie infested lands to come back with a hand full of planks, did I meet my knight. He wasn't in shining armor, he was hardly noticeable among the sand that covered him, and I didn't think much of him at first. You know the routine, cluster the supplies, ferry them back to town, strapped to my back with the same jacket that I rested my head on at night, dispose of them into the collective that we had assembled. Something possessed me at the last moment, claiming the log as my own, something that I actually owned no matter how small seemed significant at the time.</p><p>Days end happened and a soulless corpse had slipped through our garrison, I had not a weapon at my side. Foreseeing my dreadful outcome in the corpse's eyes I closed my fingers upon the log that was tossed to the side hours ago carelessly, a soft crack came as the log masticated his head against the floor below my tent. He was dead, a second time it seemed, and my white knight had saved me from uniting with the hordes of dead that were now at our gates. As my pulse slowed to its traditional rhythm I let out a breath that I didn't even know I was holding, the sickly smell of death filling my nose as I took my first breath after seeing this creature, making last night's stale crackers spill along the floor as my body rejected the every ounce of that day. With that I broke, a taste of salt was my first clue that it had happened, precious water rolling down my cheeks as I held onto the log in not only affection, but need.</p><p>It wasn't long before the people started looking at me differently, their eyes avoiding my own, I knew they heard me talking to William, and they feared that my sanity was going to collapse. We had seen it before, the brothers who prayed that their souls would find a better place as they both drank from poisoned canteens wasting our water supplies. It was sad that we didn't see it as a loss of life anymore we were too desensitizing death to afford such a thought. As the horde hit the walls once again that night I knew what day would bring, as I took a piece of sandpaper rubbing at Willam's side affectionately to care for him in our last moments. It wasn't death, but to be shunned by the very community that I had supplied for countless nights, that I had supported ever since I wandered into this city. I thought that shunning wouldn't be so hash till they took him away, throwing him into the pile of planks that I had gotten them just yesterday. They had betrayed me...</p><p>These are my last lines, as this plank is coming to its end, and it is only hours before my retribution. I consumed part of.. We always called him Orphan in the town as a nickname, but aren't we all orphans now? He had died on watch the night before, and hadn't risen yet as one of them, I can only hope that I don't die before I kill them all, to smell the fresh scent of pine.......</p><p>[The last of the writing seems to fade out as if the person was losing strength, and one final line draws off of the last period down to the bottom of the plank]</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><p><span class="tid_wspoil">My first attempt at a story, I'm a bit rusty but I hope you enjoyed it.</span></p>

                <p><strong>My Pain, The Stain</strong></p><p><em>That stain‚Ä¶ That stain‚Ä¶ Is the cause for all my pain‚Ä¶ It won‚Äôt let me sleep‚Ä¶ It won‚Äôt let me eat‚Ä¶ It keeps me here, stuck, stranded, isolated, alone. Alone with it, the stain, my pain. I scrub and I scrub and it never even fades, the vivid red blotch that is all that remains. It‚Äôs been seconds, minutes, hours, days; all is lost to the stain that is my pain that is all that remains. My fingers are broken; my rags shredded, my arms limp, for that stain is dreaded. I tried to rest ten seconds ago, or days or weeks, oh, who knows. But when I closed my eyes that stain grew brighter, and it‚Äôs crimson red colour grew lighter. I made no attempt to shriek and shout, for he who I hide from would come here no doubt. This stain must be removed before then, or I shall be hung by those accursed men. I thought about pulling up the plank, but where would I hide my mistake? And what when they come meet me here, and there‚Äôs a missing board‚Ä¶ They‚Äôll find it no doubt and I‚Äôll be fed to the horde. How much time I have left, is up for debate, for this stain has splintered my mind state. No time to think, no time to complain, not until I dealt with this stain. My broken fingers bleed into my shredded rags as my limp arms wane and whine. I scrub scrub scurb scrub scrub scrub scrub! And the stain of my mistake still remains to bring me pain! I could flip the plank, put the sight of the stain out of my brain! But the fear for the day someone notices the upturned wood, my god I can‚Äôt do that which I should! I‚Äôll never rest until I‚Äôve got this stain out of my nest, for when the body turns up he‚Äôll come by with a test. And if he spots the stain on the wall, my grips on control will fall. Water‚Ä¶ Water is what I need, but to leave this stain here would only make the situation hotter. I knew I should have been collecting those rations, stocking up with no other reason then to fit in. But it hurt so much when I dropped some on my shin. Oh what horrible regret I now face, as after several assaults I have finally left a trace. And when the man comes by with his eagle eyes, he‚Äôll sneer at me and beat me till I die. So I scrub scrub scrub scrub scrub scrub scrub scrub scrub! And the stain that remains on the wall in my shack sparkles brightly, illuminating the pain in my brain. My arms give out and my hands withdraw, my fingers no longer flex, I‚Äôm due to meet law. I hear footsteps outside, the man with the plan, he‚Äôs been waiting for this day, the day I leave a trace, he‚Äôll confront me now, face to face, and he‚Äôll spit on my shoes in awful distaste. I‚Äôve got to scrub this stain away, I don‚Äôt want to have to pay. That single red dot, right there on that spot, it has to be gone by the time he comes in‚Ä¶ SCRUB SCRUB SCRUB SCRUB SCRUB SCRUB SCRUB SCRUB SCRUB‚Ä¶</em></p>

Except my wife, of course -- she talks to me because she loves me.<br><br>I grab a comb from the dresser and try to brush the hair off my face, careful not to touch the fresh stitches around my temples. The wound itself had been inflicted a long time ago by an accident with a machete (they thought I was a zombie), but I'd been saved by just a hair that the blade didn't dig deep into my skull. It hurts like a bitch, but it didn't kill me. Now my wife stitches the wound closed every other week because there's no medicine to make it heal.<br><br>Putting the comb down, I pick up the snowglobe I inherited from my father when he was alive. It wasn't exactly a snowglobe, though: the "snow" that once filled it turned out to be styrofoam, which was pretty useful stuff to insulate things from the heat. I gave it to the town because it was more useful there. I substituted it with sand instead, so it was a sandglobe now. The little town in the middle with high walls and fences was in a desert, just like me.<br><br>The sound of a door opening catches my ear, then footsteps. In the mirror, I can see it's my wife trying to sneak up on me. I pretend not to notice.<br><br>She wraps her arms around my body from behind, both her hands meeting at my chest, gently kissing my back and neck. I smile, but suppress it. She grabs the sandglobe in my hand and sets it down. Her hands follow the hair that trails down below, and I turn around. She finds a chair and makes me sit on it. We kiss, her lips hot on my skin as she sits down on my lap, straddling me. We make love on the chair and I fall asleep. She pricks me with a needle just before I lose consciousness.<br><br>When I wake up, my wife is lying down beside me, sleeping soundly in the knowledge that I will keep her safe. I kiss her lips and she smiles, perhaps unconsciously. The sky out the window is dark, and I know I have a few moments left before midnight falls.<br><br>Gently so as not to wake her up, I get out of the bed. I look in the mirror and find new bruises there, but those bruises weren't gotten from fighting anyone. I grab the sandglobe and toss it in the air, then place it in my rucksack.<br><br>I find my clothes, pulling on the pants first, then the shoes. Socks are hard to find in the wasteland, so my feet are calloused from the blisters you get from wearing leather army boots. My shirt is silk though, and it fits so snugly and comfortably that it almost makes up for how much my feet hurt when I walk.<br><br>I heft my shield for a while, testing it's weight on my arms, and then I leave the house.<br><br>Five people walk up and down the roads, members of the Watch like me. Two wore heavy cloaks, one had a dog with an amputated leg, one had an ugly mask, while the last one had no special things at all. She just wanted to be part of the Watch.<br><br>Above us, a gigantic crow is flying in the air, ready to eat the corpses of whoever doesn't survive tonight.<br><br>A cold chill waves over all of us, even those in the houses and shacks and tents, as the distant sounds of scurrying feet start to come from every direction. We all look at the gate, the five of us anxious but prepared.<br><br>I love my wife and I would protect her from this horde. I would give my life to protect her from it. I chant the mantra in my head ceaselessly.<br><br>I close my eyes as the crow squawks, as if laughing. The gates of the town burst open, and thousands and thousands of the horde come flooding in.<br><br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico"><br><br>Earl drops the sandglobe when my team and I enter the room, shattering it. I frown and go to him, observing the devastated small town in the center, the sand all around it, and the water spill. He was starting to freak out, screaming and hurting himself on the broken glass. He thrashed around and made the four other guests in the room to act up from his tantrum.<br><br>"Someone clean this up." I command, and pick up Earl's ragdoll on the floor to keep it from getting wet. This one had a picture of his wife's face attached to its head, something Earl was extremely fixated on. I hand it to him and try to calm him down. "We'll get you a new sandglobe, okay, Earl? Look, your wife."<br><br>He accepts it and starts to calm down. I hand him a new sandglobe and stand him up. "Someone's here to visit you." I tell him. He looks at me as if he doesn't understand.<br><br>Looking around the room, I see the twins cloaked under a blanket. One of the interns was on the process of administering a sedative on them to get them to calm down. Another one, a man of 40 years old, was hiding behind an ugly orange mask as he was escorted out the room to meet his own visitors. The last one just sat in the corner, doing nothing.<br><br>I turn my attention back to Earl. "Your kids are here to see you. Do you want to see them?" Earl nods, as if he understands. I ask one of the staff to escort him out the room as I check up on his medical records on my clipboard.<br><br>"He's only getting worse," I tell my assistant when the door closes behind Earl.<br><br>"What happened to him?" she asks me.<br><br>I frown. "Something tragic. A breaking and entering. The criminals broke in specifically to hurt them. I don't know why, they weren't caught. The police report says it's possibly bad blood."<br><br>My assistant hands me some papers to sign, to verify that Earl is getting the correct dosage of medicine. "So they did that to him?"<br><br>"They found his wife first," I continue. "He tried to protect her, the poor man. They killed her in front of him, then beat him almost to death. The trauma did that to him."<br><br>I hand her the clipboard. I don't tell my assistant how Earl got castrated.<br><br>"He's always saying something," my assistant mentions. "It's a little freaky."<br><br>"Earl?" I say. "Yes. Something about an epoch."<br><br>My assistant rubs her arms, goosebumps breaking out on her skin. "I don't like this job."<br><br>I give her a pointed stare. Neither did I.</p>

                <p>The only pain worse than death is rebirth.</p><p>Rebirth isn‚Äôt even an appropriate name for The Event. You are no babe, there are no children. Only adults eaten alive than mysteriously reconstituted. No one has seen The Event from outside their own eyes.</p><p>One moment you are fighting to keep the life you have when the soft teeth finally tear your flesh from your bones, your nerve endings on fire as you panic and fight harder as those teeth multiply and fingers pull at you. They always seem to find your navel, digging into the grip and pulling it wide, another cold finger pulls the other way and you hyperventilate feeling your body stretch and rip, if you're lucky you can‚Äôt see. But when was the last time you knew luck?</p><p>But that is just a stub of the toe compared to when your soul bolts from that body. You notice it‚Äôs joints stiffen and twitch and whatever is left of it stands as your consciousness sears across the globe.</p><p>A silent scream is held in your eternal self.</p><p>A thousand simultaneous pains too intense for any body to contain is your experience. You know it will be over soon, you have done this a dozen times before but the pain never callouses.</p><p>At last, The Event. Forcibly your identity is thrust into a husk and your new body awakens. As familiar as the last. As familiar as the next. Fresh, hot air fills your lungs at once and exits loudly. Tears stream from your new eyes onto your new cheeks and a black crow perches on an old post.</p><p>‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù You whisper to the crow, the same crow you‚Äôve seen dozens of times with its distinctive white feather on the tip of its wing. ‚ÄúAgain?‚Äù</p><p>The crow caws at you and flies toward the north and you see the town. Always a town.</p><p>As you near the town you see silhouettes in the horizon. Your new neighbors have arrived.</p><p>40 crows caw as one from the town walls and fly out into the wastes.</p><p>Whispers greet you from the inhabitants. Complaining of The Event and of some familiar faces. Some hold each other quietly as you walk to an empty plot and claim it as your own. And you see her.</p><p>You‚Äôve never seen her before, her hair is tangled in knots and her eyes are all brown her pupils are like pinholes and she climbs.</p><p>She climbs over the sobs of the others.</p><p>She climbs over the fights of past lives done wrong.</p><p>She climbs past the finite water and the limited resources. She climbs over all our struggles to dodge The Event one more day.</p><p>And more literally she climbs on top of the heap that will soon be a workshop and she screams.</p><p>A long sustained wail ripples past her cheeks and she robs everyones attention. You know what happens next, you‚Äôve seen if a few times before, looking around you figure most the folks here have not seen it before.</p><p>As her siren wears out she takes a breath and a crow flies back perched on the ridge of our gates. She points to the crow and shouts at us ‚Äúwhat is he doing here?! Always following and always watching!‚Äù She throws a rock at the bird. At least you assume that is where she was aiming for the rock hit the gate at least 10 feet below the bird. He stares and blinks.</p><p>‚ÄúHe witness‚Äôs both ends of The Event‚Äù An audible gasp circulates the masses, The Event is rarely spoken of and only in hushed wimpers. Even you furrow your brow. And another onyx fiend flies in to join it‚Äôs brother. ‚ÄúHe knows why we are here! DO YOU?!‚Äù</p><p>Her arms outspread she pauses and waits for suggestion.</p><p>‚ÄúCell phones!‚Äù A cry from a corner offers and she spits.</p><p>‚ÄúMicrowave ovens!‚Äù She laughs with contempt for that idea. Shadows quickly pass over her as more birds join at the wall.</p><p>‚ÄúWe have all heard those fancy and convenient stories before I‚Äôll wager I‚Äôve heard them longer then most of you!‚Äù Everyones ears were hers as she lowered her voice to slightly more than a whisper. ‚ÄúBut what is the truth, why do we become zombies‚Äù She laughs a crackled laugh followed with coughing ‚ÄúZombies?! Really? Zombies were for movies and books in our previous days, before this nightmare begun‚Äù</p><p>Forgetting yourself, you stand up angry at her suddenly. You open your mouth to shout but someone beats you to it ‚ÄúHEY!‚Äù A stupid thing to say really. But you yourself don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre so mad at her you just know that no one EVER talked about the time before the zombies, before The Event before the dessert.</p><p>‚ÄúOH ho ho‚Äù She spun to meet the voice and hopped down to meet it‚Äôs owner ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt like thinking about that do you? There was a time when Zombies were fiction and reincarnation was not quite so literal wasn‚Äôt there?‚Äù The wall was blanketed with crows now and their caws made for a buzz. ‚ÄúYes and crows, crows were never on our mind‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúHow many times have you died stranger?‚Äù The man asked the woman with profound fear.</p><p>‚ÄúI have lost track, well over 300, I once survived 2 months but never have I seen any rain other than the occasional shaman dance‚Äù She snapped her fingers and got along with her point ‚ÄúHow many of you have seen a natural rain?‚Äù And she was met with silence.</p><p>Deep in your gut you realize where you are. You‚Äôve known if for at least 3 lives, but you never let it surface to your psyche.</p><p>‚ÄúWhy are we here‚Äù She asks and looks at you directly ‚ÄúYou know, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p><p>You nod and everyone snaps to your location.</p><p>‚ÄúHow many times have you died?‚Äù She walks to you and you look up thinking, shaking with fear. The town is surrounded with crows now and you shrug your shoulders breathing in a shaky breath.</p><p>‚ÄúDo you remember your first death?‚Äù She touches your shoulder with sympathy and before you say anything she says ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt do you? it‚Äôs okay no one does.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I remember my first life‚Äù You manage to blurt out ‚ÄúIf i concentrate hard enough‚Äù</p><p>She nods absently and ignores that. ‚ÄúSo where are we now, friend? Where are we now‚Äù</p><p>The crows shout as one so that no one hears you. Well over 100 crows surround the town, ebony feathers falling on the towns 40 heads.</p><p>You shout at the top of your lungs where you believe you are only to be drowned in a symphony of caws. The woman looks around and some of the smaller crows take flight, circling the town. She looks at you earnestly and nods.</p><p>For a moment the noise pauses, the longest 3 seconds of your life and you repeat what you had shouted. ‚ÄúThis is Hell‚Äù</p><p>The crows did not want to hear that as they all take flight, no longer cawing only circling your town</p><p>She looks at you with sadness drawn on her face. ‚Äúdo you know what they call a flock of crows?‚Äù</p><p>Before you can answer the gates buckle and groans are heard on the other side. The town moves as one to push against the doors. You, yourself run to the doors when a bird lands on your shoulder. You look at the bird curiously, they have never touched you before and you see the telling feather on its wing. ‚ÄúI was right wasn‚Äôt I?‚Äù the bird caws at you as if to agree than darts at your eye ball.</p><p>You scream but no one can hear you as they push against the wall and try to stop the onslaught of zombies. Another peck with a sharp beak pierces your eye lid and you feel wetness run down your cheek. With your other eye you see a mound of black birds muffle a womans scream as the birds move back and forth around the town. Than you feel a needle sharp pain, than you see nothing. All you can feel is daggers over your body and wind pushing against you, your tongue is pulled out of your screaming mouth as you fall to the ground and suddenly your consciousness sears across the globe.</p><p>A silent scream is held in your eternal self.</p><p>A thousand simultaneous pains too intense for any body to contain is your experience. You know it will be over soon, you have done this a dozen times before but the pain never callouses.</p><p>At last, The Event. Forcibly your identity is thrust into a husk and your new body awakens. As familiar as the last. As familiar as the next. Fresh, hot air fills your lungs at once and exits with rasps. Tears stream from your new, whole eyes onto your new cheeks and a black crow perches on an old post with some red meat in its beak.</p><p>‚ÄúYou!‚Äù You say. but nothing comes out ‚ÄúYou‚Äù once again your attempt at speech is fruitless. Your mouth feels empty. An odd feeling for a mouth. The white tipped bird drops the red meat in front of you and you realize it‚Äôs your tongue. He caws at you again and flies to the west showing you your new home.</p>

                <p><strong><em>The Completionist</em></strong></p><p>As a journalist everything I have discovered has to be put down, though I don't think the papers are running anymore, and the truth will probably not be ascertained. Maybe it‚Äôs just my way of dealing with what transpired, dealing with the fact that I'll never see the people I love again, and the terrible things I had to do up till now. These calloused hands now stained in crimson, just as others are.</p><p>From my research into the Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) facility, in what used to be Utah back before the government collapsed, I uncovered the corpses of mutilated rats littering the rooms of the laboratory. In most cases they were dissected, torn apart for further research, but a few had survived. They were barely hanging on to life or perhaps something bordering life and death, held in a paradoxical state of confusion that has yet to be rectified, and probably never will.</p><p>I should clarify the state in which I found them; most of them were missing body parts, their teeth pulled. Bodies pinned to a cork sheet with their ligaments spread, held in place by small metal rods, staring at you blankly with their black, soulless eyes. More unsettling then the human corpses, it seemed like they were only the first to be experimented on, tested with the HSCs. Furthering my investigation, I found rusted cages restraining the primates in the back portion of the lap, a time line laid out in front of me, beginning with rats escalating to more advanced species, foreshadowing the deepest corners of the facility.</p><p>Spending weeks in the confines this facility, although I spent that time researching, it was mostly stalling for the inevitable, when I would have to go into the deepest corners, to the mysteries that I am compelled to discover. It grasped at my most morbid fantasies, seeing the origins of this nightmare. I already knew what contributed to this anarchy; I already had my story why does this curiosity drive me so?</p><p>Ensuing two days in the last rooms of the facility, it was disheartening in a way, the offices were void of anything, and not even a single drop of blood contaminated the machinery. Collective stories and written testimonies cluttered these rooms, hinting at the fact that it never got as far as human research. Whatever happened must have transgressed before it could progress that far.</p><p>Under a pile of bone marrow biopsy needles there was a leather briefcase of files dealing with the experiments done here, code named Tithonus after the Greek lover of Eos, who was granted immortality. I found myself intrigued by their methods, a bio-engineered white blood cell that rapidly spread though the body donated by ‚ÄòPatient Zero‚Äô code named Workshop. The blood that was donated changed the properties of marrow inside of the new patient, making it produce HSCs at an increased rate; the only side effect of the treatment seemed to be that the marrow would wear out, needing a transplant of new materials every few days. The primates that were injected by the modified blood cells, named the ‚ÄòModified Workshop O type Blood Cell,' upon missing a treatment, the primates got violent attacking their cell mates. Injuries healed from the primates at an increased rate after the attack, the primates that attacked its cell mate consuming some of the other‚Äôs bone marrow.</p><br><p>The research went on without incident till one of the larger primates fell from his cage, impaling himself through the heart with a tree branch. Its body convulsed for a few minutes before going limp. Checking his body after, they found no activity in the brain or the heart, marking the test as only a partial success as they were looking for the key to immortality. An incident happened a day later as the primate seemingly came back to life, further research showed brain damage in the primate, the reasoning and empathy centers of the brain. Most of it seemed to have been completely destroyed, the area of the brain that held language skills was severely damaged. It makes sense from a ghoulish standpoint, hunting down the people they called friends, lying to them before the crack of a baseball bat sends them to their bloody demise.</p><p>Letting him back into the cages with another primate showed shocking results, the primate that came back from the dead, named Caesar, a single bite from the other primate made a festering wound. Examining the wound showed a slow acting virus in the blood stream, out of arrogance and ignorance they watched as the virus took hold of this new primate, it dying in only a few hours. This time they decided to dispose of the body, placing it on a tray to go into the incinerator. Unbelievably as they were moving the body the primate started to come back, thrashing against the restraints.</p><br><p>In the following hours, the head scientist went home sick, he sounded frantic saying that he needed to pick up his kid from baseball practice on the way home and spend time with him. His actions are written down as suspicious, and it calls for a team of security to monitor him without him knowing. Communications with the security team stopped the next day, the last transmission spoke of a child biting him in the torso, before shooting the child‚Äôs brains over the sidewalk. The report ends there, the date showing it was only five days before the epidemic spread across the world.</p><br><p>As I write this it makes me wonder if this is the immortality that they wanted, is this success in the scientist‚Äôs books? Either way it seems like I have spent too much time in this facility the horde seems to be banging at the door, all I can do at this point is open that bottle of Wake the Dead that I have sitting at the bottom of my backpack. This is a farewell to whoever might read this; hopefully this isn't the end of the human race. I can toast to that, to the last of the human race, hopefully you don‚Äôt get the Tithonus curse of immortality.</p><br><p>______________________________________________________</p><br><br><p>On a small computer in a laboratory somewhere, two men stood staring at the screen, their faces illuminated with the lights from the screen. Simple text rolled down it as they read. The last few words blinked on the screen as they spoke to each other, sweat rolling down the more heavy set of the two's forehead.</p><p>"Yes, or no Richard?" The heavy set man looked to his partner, waiting for an answer he wiped his brow with a napkin that lay next to the keyboard.</p><p>"No, one result is not proof enough, run the experiment again." The smaller man, assumed to be named Richard, turned from the screen after typing a single key both of them walking out.</p><p>Blinking on the screen were the final words, "Subject 4072 has accepted his death, a reasonable explanation has satisfied his curiosity, program end? (Y or N) N."</p>

                <p><strong>Cubically Contained</strong></p><p><em>The smell of the musty shack was the first thing I remember noticing inside the ‚ÄúShady Bar‚Äù. The room was poorly lit, with light only coming in through the now open doorway and holes in the ceiling. The air was thick from cigarette smoke further hindering my vision, but my eyes quickly adjusted. The Shady Bar was a small shack, one room, one bar, one exit. The bar was at the back of the room, with a few stools set out front. A single table stood in the middle of the room with a few chairs. Three other men were in the room, two sitting at the table with their feet up, and one behind the counter going pulling out the bottles. They all turned their heads to me when I came in. I remember not recognizing any of them; they were all strangers to me. I took a seat at a stool in front of the counter, and the man behind it slid me a yellow syringe. I shot some of that yellow stuff up my arm, feeling a moment of blissful happiness before sinking back into my dreary situation. Next the man slid me a murky bottle with something twitching in it. I drank it back, then tossed the bottle into the wall. I was disappointed to see that it didn't explode. It just thunked off the wall and rolled into the corner. But the drink dulled my sense of reality, and I turned to look at the two men at the table. They were sucking back smokes as if they were part of a marathon. Light Suck Flick, Light Suck Flick, Light Suck Flick‚Ä¶ They stared at the sky as they smoked, eyes vacant of thought. I returned my attention to the man behind the counter, he had left two drinks in front of me and a few multi-coloured pills. I drank the washed the pills down with the ‚Äúliquid‚Äù, feeling my head finally let go. I remember resting my head on the table for a second, closing my eyes to try to get some sleep. When I opened them there was another bottle and a syringe. I shot one up, and drank one down, but I don‚Äôt think I did it correctly, because I remember spending the rest of the day with a stinging tongue, and some sticky foul smelling substance covering my arm. One of the men at the tables broke the silence. ‚ÄúShit.‚Äù It seemed at the time the most suitable word to start our conversation. The other man at the table continued, ‚ÄúShiiiiiit‚Äù. The man from behind the counter scurried over to them and dropped five or six bottles and a pile of smokes. They went back to their binge, and I waited patiently for more bottles to appear in front of me. They did. And I made them disappear. It began. My legs went dead, then my back went numb. I slumped over the counter, feeling the world slip away. But one of the men at the tables broke my transformation with a question. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù. I groggily turned around to face him. <br>‚ÄúWhy what?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhy how?‚Äù The other man at the table chided in:<br>‚ÄúWhy why?‚Äù I heard a bottle slap against the wood behind me and I reached back and took it.<br>‚ÄúWhat why when how?‚Äù The two men at the tables looked at each other, then all three of us drank our drinks in unison.<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell yah why how when who‚Äù said one of the men.<br>‚ÄúI never said who‚Äù, I responded.<br>‚ÄúHow can I say how and why without who?‚Äù He responded.<br>‚ÄúWhy say how and who at all?‚Äù I exclaimed. He looked at me funny, his face scrunching up.<br>‚ÄúWhy what you talk about?‚Äù he mumbled almost inaudibly. I sagged in my chair, a syringe appearing in my hand and penetrating my flesh. The other man poked back in, more audibly then the other:<br>‚ÄúIt ‚Äòas a govermint! Dey got us all tangle up in dis shit‚Äù. I sighed and sucked back more ‚Äúalcohol‚Äù. He continued:<br><br>‚ÄúWe was all livin good and fine. Big cities, big ladehs, big foods. Life ‚Äòas goin goood. But the govermint got greedy. It wanded moe. It build dese metal box thingies dat we all had to step indo. An experimint. We had to all go in dese medal boxes and‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶ We go to a not real realidy. A luson. A dreem we can‚Äôt wakey up fom. We still in dose boxes. Ow bodies are. But we are here. Our mindz‚Ä¶ We dere but we heer. Government did ‚Äòis to us to see what we do. To see how we react. We supposed to get moe for dis, when we wake up. But we don‚Äôt wake up. Sometin wong. So we stuck here. They eyder forget or fuck up. So we wait. That‚Äôs who, why, how. When? When is no madder. All dat madder is won day we all wake up.‚Äù<br><br>I remember thinking that he was making sense. When I think about it now though, it doesn‚Äôt make a lick of sense. What the hell was he trying to say through that drunken slur? Hell if I know, hell if I care. The man at the table, when finished his rant, began drowning himself in the bottles laid out in front of him. I turned and popped some more pills that were laid out at the counter behind me. The man behind the bar was gorging on some meat. I remember asking him for some, and he gave me a slab. It was tasteless, and made me thirsty. I lumbered over and sat at the table with the man. He still had his feet up, and his head lolled back. The man from behind the counter wiped his mouth with a torn piece of fabric, and moved to give me another pill. He too joined the chat. ‚ÄúYou think this is an experiment? That this is an induced dream? That we are being monitored?‚Äù He shook his head and laughed. ‚ÄúWhat do <strong>you</strong> think is happening?‚Äù I popped the pill and looked up at his great big smile:<br><br>‚ÄúThe apocalypse‚Ä¶ We are the unforgiven men and women left to burn... Burn with... With the souls of the damned... The dead rise... And they consume... We are among them... We are among the dead... For we are damned... The crow is our tormentor... Watching above... Directing the play... We are trapped to this hell... Because... There is nowhere to move on to... That is why... That is how.. Who and when isn't important‚Äù.<br><br>The man laughed. I put my head down on the table surrounded by empty bottles. I remember being confused. I didn‚Äôt remember drinking all these bottles myself, and I didn‚Äôt remember the other man having anything to drink at all. My head was spinning. I closed my eyes, trying to gain control over all the substances swimming through my brain and blood. The sign that brought me to The Shady bar etched to the back of my eyelids. Beside the destroyed gates, written in blood on the wall, ‚ÄúTOWN DEAD. LETS GET FUCKED. GO NORTH.‚Äù Well I felt fucked. I remember hearing the man behind me talking. I think he said:<br><br>‚ÄúGovernment experiment gone wrong? Eternal damnation? So silly we are. So cynical. Why can‚Äôt we just accept our fate? This is where we are. It doesn't matter why, or who, or when, or how. All that matters is what we do now. You had your fun, now it‚Äôs time to sleep‚Äù.<br><br>The last thing I remember was the smell. The rancid smell of the ans breath.<br><br>‚ÄúSo what does it matter where we are? What does it matter where we are? What does it matter when we are? All that matters is life now and death later! Live! Lie! Love! Consume!‚Äù The men at the bar stared at me. Their faces showed they were unimpressed. I sat down and asked the bartender for another drink. No one wants to worry about questions, and no one wants to be told not to worry about questions. So lets just get pissed and pass out.<br></em></p>

                <p>This is a true story. I tried to stick with facts as much as possible. What if....the people survived this? What if they were turned into zombies? The viruses I described here are highly contagious. Almost always fatal.</p><br><br><p>In the 1980s, a new highway linked the small villages in the Congo, Uganda, Nairobi and others. <strong>The Kinshasa Highway</strong> is an informal name for the route. This route was carved out of thick jungle and paved in most areas. There were some areas that were just rough tracks. After this ‚Äúhighway‚Äù was built, Aids spread quickly. As the new access allowed carriers of the disease to travel from populated areas to more isolated areas. Prostitutes at truck stops helped spread the disease even faster. The highway is still known to this day as the Aids Highway. HIV is considered highly lethal, but not very infective. For instance unless you are sharing body fluids you will probably not get it. Biosafety Level 2 agent. No need to wear a spacesuit to handle HIV</p><p>In 1980 a man and his girlfriend, traveling the Aids highway, went camping in the rain forest of Mount Elgon National Park, on the border of Uganda and Kenya. While there they visited Kitum Cave. <br>The cave extends about 700 feet into the side of the mountain. The walls are rich in salt, and animals such as elephants have gone deep into the cave for centuries in search of the salt. The elephants use their tusks to break off pieces of the cave wall that they then chew and swallow, there is also a lot of guano (excrement) deeper in the cave from fruit-eating and carnivorous bats. Sadly, there is also a deep crevasse, which is filled with mummified young, baby elephants that have fallen in to it and were unable to get out.</p><p>While visiting the cave, the man and woman woke hundred of bats. The man either had a cut or other open wound, before entering the cave or he may have cut his hand on the cave‚Äôs salt crystals, but he somehow got guano from the fruit-eating bats into an open wound.</p><p>The man went home. He gets a headache several days later. Then a few days after that a severe backache, along with the severe headache. He stays home from work. By the 10th day he is nauseated, feverish and vomits so much he only has the dry heaves. His coworkers go to his house to check on him and take him to the local hospital.</p><p>Noted on the hospital records:<br>Patient Passive, He has an ‚Äúexpressionless‚Äù look. When asked to follow a light his eyes do not move side to side. The whites of the eyes are blood red. Skin is yellow with red spots. Memory loss but not delirious.</p><p>Unable to diagnose him, and in a move that will stun the world, they gave him antibiotics and told him to get on the first flight he could arrange and go to Nairobi Hospital.</p><p>On the flight. He was even more nauseated and everyone on the plane notices his condition. <br>He continues to vomit. Now its bright red (fresh blood) with black (coffee ground looking old blood). His eyes become redder. His face starts showing dark bruises as the skin and connective tissue starts to detach from the bone. Massive amounts of blood clots have formed clogging many veins and arteries. This causes a stroke and some brain damage. The vessels in his nose rupture and he has an unstoppable nose bleed.</p><p>Everyone on the plane watches him in horror and concern. The stewardess tries to help.</p><p>As soon as the plane touches down he is taken by taxi to the hospital. He is still conscious.</p><p>He gets to the hospital and has to wait, while he is waiting he gets dizzy, leans over, vomits only bright red blood now, finally losing consciousness, his intestines rip open and he begins to bleed out of every orifice. <br>The virus now looks for a new host.</p><p>The nurses quickly put him on a gurney and take him to see the Doctor.<br>The doctor only knows that the man is suffering from a massive hemorrhage.<br>During the initial exam the man stops breathing because he has inhaled the blood into his lungs. His pulse becomes weak and slow. He has now suffered severe brain damage. While trying to look down the man‚Äôs throat he vomits blood on the doctor. The doctor cannot replace the blood the man is losing because every time he tries to insert a needle it leaves an open hole for more blood to leak from. <br>The man died the next morning with the doctor at his side<br>He was bleeding from every opening in his body. The ears, eyes, mouth, nose, penis rectum, and IV sites. All of his organs had failed. The doctor did not know how to classify his death. He was buried in a waterproof bag.</p><p>9 days after the death of the man, the doctor began to get a terrible headache and backache. He thought that because he was turning 30 it was just aging kind of aches. <br>The ache moved throughout his body and still he thought nothing significant of it. <br>When he saw his eyes were turning red he thought it might be malaria, he started taking medicine for malaria. The shot should not have been painful but he noted it was extremely painful. He then got abdominal pain and thought he might have typhoid fever. Although in pain he still took care of his patients at the hospital. <br>When he started noticing that his face ‚Äúwas expressionless‚Äù he opted for exploratory surgery. During the surgery they could not stop the bleeding. <br>The doctor appeared to be dying for unknown reasons. <br>Finally one of the doctors caring for him decided to send the blood for testing of a new virus.</p><p>The results come back. A little known deadly virus was found in the doctor‚Äôs blood. The researchers don‚Äôt know much about the Marburg virus. A Biosafety level 4 virus. <br>This virus is so deadly and contagious that it is only handled with the biosafety hazard suits.</p><p>The suits when handling 4 of the deadliest viruses know to man. <br>Level room 1: Scrubs<br>Level room 2: socks<br>Level room 3: Taping of all the clothes together, making a seal beck to ankles. They put on spacesuits with its own air supply. They double glove with special gloves.<br>They check each other for tears <br> <br>This is just the beginning of a tale that spanned a few decades</p><p>A 17 year old visited the Kitum Cave a few months later and died the same way, massive hemorrhage.</p><p>This could have been the end of the world as we know it if it was not contained.</p><p>In 2012 a funeral was held for a 3 month old in Uganda. The funeral practices include cleaning the body and dressing the child at home. At the funeral many others held the baby, kissing and cuddling the child one last time before burial. After the funeral 14 people died of the Ebola virus.</p><p>The Ebola virus reacts the same way as the Marburg virus and is also a Biosafety level 4 virus.</p><p>During one outbreak, the virus killed everyone in the operating room during an operation to remove an appendix from a man carrying the virus. There were also many patients admitted to the hospital with the same symptoms, including nuns that had worked at small clinics in the rain forest. Most of the hospital staff fled and didn‚Äôt come back to work. Doctors were seen carrying caskets to a communal grave to burn the bodies.</p><p>Currently there are 4 viruses that are are Biosafety Level 4 agents. Ebola, Marburg, Ravn, These viruses are extremely dangerous to humans, Highly infectious, high fatality rate, with no known treatments or cures. <br> <br>There are other viruses that are ‚Äúrelatives‚Äù to these. Reston virus for one‚Ä¶.<br>Named because it was found in Reston Virginia. Less than 15 miles from Washington DC. It was found in a monkey house, 100s of monkeys were infected and euthanized immediately. <br>Monkey houses are near most research centers. And are used for testing because they are the closest to humans in DNA. Most of the time the Monkey houses are run by people not related to the research facilities. The houses typically have their own monkey doctors. And can hold 100s to thousands of imported monkeys, The most common monkey used for research is the rhesus macaqu</p><p>It is believed that Aids, Ebola, Marburg, Rvan, Reston originated from monkeys. <br>And spread all over the world by transporting the monkeys for research, <br>There is a similar fever that monkeys get, Simian Hemorrhagic Fever that mimics all the viruses mentioned. Most monkey handlers assume that is what the monkey die of.</p><p>So....what if?</p>

                <p>That was a very good story Deb, but I think that the HIV is actually a Biosafety Level 4 agent very much like filoviruses like the Ebola virus and the Marburg virus, as there is no known available cure for it.

                <p>Well, I'm not an expert on the subject, but I had read that level 4 agents are highly contagious and deadly (with no available effective cures), but not necessarily both at the same time. And also, the protocols of health workers that work with those patients are different, as an airborne-transmitted virus requires more safety procedures than one that is not. Then again, I might be wrong <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">.

                <p>Oh god.<br>They‚Äôre going to eat me alive. <br>It‚Äôs all I could think about today. Milk colored eyes and broken teeth desiring my flesh. They breached the gates yesterday and pounded at my door all night. When I finally left my barricade the sun was bright and hot, a deceptively perfect day to be enjoyed by me and seven others. <br> Without a word we got busy pouring what little water we had left on the festering remains of our past friends. I let the others repair our defenses, while I curled to a corner and cried. They‚Äôre going to eat me alive. They‚Äôre going to eat me alive. <br>They are going to eat me‚Ä¶ alive!<br>Alive. <br>There‚Äôs still time‚Ä¶ 7 minutes to midnight. The thought invaded my conscious like an army of groaning monsters exploit a hole in the towns wall, slow at first but quickly filling every void, devouring any other thought. That old school isn‚Äôt too far away, I can make it there. I know I can. <br>This town is nothing but breathing bait. Warm bread for the undead. Seven fools begging to be watered in the morning. <br>I can do it. They won‚Äôt stop me. It‚Äôs not too far away. <br>Quick as a snap I uncurl and run to the ‚Äòbank‚Äô. They all spent the day repairing our impressive walls with makeshift armements, impressive for sure but it won‚Äôt stop the fiends, the breathing bait will be tired and no one bothered opening the gates this morning. So they are probably all holed up in their fortresses of broken wood and rusted metal. <br>Yeah‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ YEAH! They want us alive, they want the living. If I give them living they won‚Äôt bother me. <br>‚ÄòI‚Äôll need water‚Äù I whisper as I rummage our pile of resources. ‚ÄúLots of water who knows how long until i find a safer town.‚Äù<br> I could carry maybe a weeks worth. The well has been dried for 2 days now but there should be some in our towns collective ‚Äòbank‚Äô.<br>‚ÄúWhat are you doing here, Amanda?‚Äù My head jerks up and I see some talking bait. He has a shopping cart filled with food and batteries, and over his shoulder: a battery launcher, it‚Äôs screws and bolts loose from use and neglect. <br>‚ÄúKy!‚Äù I‚Äôve been caught! but so has he, I think of a convincing lie but before i can say it he levels the gun to me. I sigh. ‚ÄúLook we can fend off more demons of the desert if we go together. There are 2 weeks worth of water here, we can get to another town in a week‚Äù<br>I don‚Äôt like the way his face looks. But he lowers the gun from his cheek. The bait still points it at me though. ‚ÄúAmanda where were you thinking of going?‚Äù<br>Far off in the desert a chorus of moans alert us to the time. ‚ÄúThe Library! we can get there in five minutes if we leave NOW‚Äù The lure nods and slings his gun behind him and helps me load all my water into his cart. I grab myself a machete from the bank and we run toward the gates.<br>They are heavy but we push them open and stare into the sands. The bait points and runs toward the library slowing the progression of monsters as he advances. Wasting all my batteries on beasts that won‚Äôt hurt us! I keep my machete close as i know I will need it soon.<br>When we arrived at the safety of the library we only had maybe 30 seconds to secure ourselves. That stupid undead enticement started finding anything he could to help board the doors. I loading my equipment into the moldy building. <br>And then we saw oblivion. A legion of zombies coming from all around intent on my old home. A box of snacks for those zombies. ‚ÄúAmanda it‚Äôs time!‚Äù I nod and run toward the newly reinforced doors. A zombie breaks its course suddenly and sees the piece of meat named Ky. Hobbling toward him the monster groans.<br>But it is prepared, and fires a battery at the predator and it‚Äôs head snaps off its neck. The body doesn‚Äôt seem to know that yet though as it continues to advance.<br>Running now, I grip my machete over my head. It‚Äôs surprisingly sharp but I‚Äôll need all the strength i have. Fresh meat screams as I remove his arm from his shoulder. He falls to the sand in pain and shock. I run past him kicking his arm as far from the library as I can.<br>‚ÄúNO AMANDA!!! NO!!‚Äù I slam the door behind me and breath deep. I can hear the agony of my bait. ‚ÄúKILL ME AMANDA KILL ME!!!!‚Äù<br>Panting I push my supplies to the middle of the library, the wheel creaks and my heart pounds but I can still hear that stupid lure.<br>‚ÄúAMANDA! YOU HAVE TO KILL ME! THEY‚ÄôRE GOING TO EAT ME ALIVE!‚Äù</p>

                <p><em><strong>The Howl of Serpents </strong></em></p><p>Sabrina sat next to the water pump, the last drop of water seemed to have been taken from it a day ago. The gentle breeze of hot sand making her thirst even worse, so she stayed next to the pump. It was surrounded by a small brick wall to keep the sand from getting into the well when it was just a well. Licking her lips she settled back, relaxing was all she could do, wait for dehydration or for more water. The cold night would be the only comfort in the next few hours as the heat became visible, like the rising heat off of a stove, it made the smell of bacon come to her mind. It was a lingering memory, not even worth mentioning from before the zombies, from before towns.</p><p>Silence moved in, the town becoming less productive as the day went on, a few people heading out of the town in search of water. She wondered how many would come back, its been eighteen days since they put up the walls so the zombies were gathering. Each person had along with them a battery launcher, and one a black tabby that seemed scared out of its mind. The cats seemed to be the key to their survival, natural predators to the zombies, it didn't make sense, but neither did the decomposition rate of the zombies should water get splashed on them. It was just knowledge that they had, it didn't need to make sense anymore, just needed to work. She held her glare too long though, the cat now staring at her its yellow eyes like devilish gateways to hell, and she looked away quickly, though not quick enough to swear that it smiled at her. She shivered at this thought, one of her fears since she was a kid, the zombies didn't even startle her as much as the cat that was being taken with them.</p><p>The full moon drifted slowly along in the in the starless night, and she frowned at it brooding over the lack of communication. They had not returned, she felt relieved that the tabi wasn't back but loosing more people was never worth the death of a cat. It was hours after the zombies left that one man came back, letting out a sigh of relief she saw what he was holding and gasped. It was a blue flame. How could someone hold on to fire? The question stood as a man, wearing an orange mask that she had only seen once before, but she had assumed long dead.</p><p>He leaned forward, what she assumed from her perspective to sniff it before he moved back raising a single hand in the air, "This... is a man's soul, collect more because tonight we shall have rain. If you bring me a map, I can show you where others are my body senses more."</p><p>The sky broke suddenly as he held the soul above his head, his body convulsing as if stuck by lightning the flame dissipated into the area, the strange man started to dance in the absence of it. A miracle happened that night, its touch so cold it burned a bit in contrast to the desert heat, you could see the dirt and grime of despair being washed away by the water, a new light of hope in people's eyes.</p><p>The days passed on, the zombie horde pressing ever vigilant at the town's gates, and for the first three days the supply of souls was coming in like clockwork. Friendships where now started to be formed again as everything seemed to be going well once more. Sabrina smiled softly, and waved back to Alexander as he left the gate each day, his blue bandanna covering the top of his head. He had told her the night prior that she was his only reason for coming back to the camp, he had everything when he was out there except her.</p><p>His dog always looked a bit jealous when they were together, and seemed a bit overly excited to leave the city when they did. She knew not to make attachments, it was one of the first unwritten rules that they had in this town, but there was no helping it the heart wanted what the heart wanted.</p><p>The Fith day came, the Shaman, as we have now started calling him, pointed out the next soul that our expedition team had to find. It was in a troubling spot since our watchtower had told us that over twenty zombies were in the area. As the talks of plans settled, a haunted ghost of a cat hissed as Alexander walked out with it, holding it in his arms wrapped in a blanket. The black cat was missing an ear, and an eye, its body twisting as if trying to kill all of us as it started at the group its eyes blazing in fury. My body physically recoiled at the sight of it as Alexander walked into the center of the group volunteering himself for the expedition. Four others volunteered themselves, and headed out without a word otherwise, Alexander giving Sabrina a reassuring smile as he headed out.</p><p>No communication, she thought as the gates to the town closed, the horde trying to slam themselves against the wall as the lock settled in. They had not returned at the same time they usually do, and the look of despair on the last ten of our faces you could see our thoughts. We had assumed this would work, just like every day prior, no one doubted Alexander's expeditions, no one doubted his capabilities, but truth was now settling in.</p><p>Two days passed, and the town had given up hope on the expedition ever returning, it was then that something seemed to snap inside of Sabrina. A smile ran along her face as she knew exactly what to do, and started to plan inside of her tent.</p><p>As the next day came someone had found a soul, laying in the center of the town blood smeared across the ground and dragged to the gates before disappearing. The record books had seemed to have been tampered with, no one knowing who was now gone till a headcount was done. A man, in his late thirties was now missing, Baldy was his nickname here though he always joked that he was just taller then his hair. Blood covered his tent, splashed like decorations, it wasn't too hard to imagine that Baldy was dead, the final nail was the blue flame in the center.</p><p>It was chaos, the world broke that moment, you could almost see it as all trust for the town became accusing eyes looking from one another. As darkness settled in, and the zombies were heard in the distance, they all heard something that chilled their bones. A howl responding to the zombie's cries, it was the sound that a wolf would make in the stories of their youth. They knew that wolves no longer existed in these wastelands, but something didn't settle right even if it was a human that made that sound.</p><p>As the sun rose, four more were gone, three from the wall and one laying dead his corpse turn to shreds the only thing that identified the man was his head. Laying on the ground staring into nothing as his hallow eyes seemed to smile at you, their only chance of survival, the shaman. Sabrina felt a little disappointed seeing the man behind the mask, his face not looking like something that her mind had fictionally made, not as fantastic, he was an ordinary man. Pudgy cheeks seemed to be slightly bloated, and his hair was darkened by the dirt layered in it, someone had taken quite a time to make sure his eyes settled on you the moment you walked into his tent.</p><p>She looked around suddenly, and realized how little were left in the village, only five of them still remained. All eyes were cast to each other, knowing that it had to be one of us six that had murdered Baldy, and the shaman. It would be tonight that the final wave of zombies would descend upon them, they knew time was up at the sight of the shaman. So they waited, in silence, they waited for their death to come upon them. Conversations began to idly sprout among them as they looked to the sunset, a smile softly coming to Sabrina's lips seeing the beautiful blood red of the sun. ‚ÄúIf only I could cover this world with this...‚Äù She mumbled to herself, it was the last thing she remembered.</p><p>They should have seen it, the change in her body language, the confidence that she now showed even with her impending death. She had pulled out a knife, which they assumed was to slaughter the zombies as she got turned into one of them. They didn't notice the blood dried at the handle, or the look of hunger as she spoke to them until it was too late to do anything. When the zombies came they would be disappointed, only one woman standing in a crimson garden of organs her eyes ablaze with madness as she howled to the full moon. Sabrina was gone, there was only the Queen of the Damned, the Lady of Lies, the Serpent's tongue.</p>

                <p><strong>Bing A Ling Ching Ding Boom Boom Boom</strong></p><p><em>As the last lights faded all Billy Little could see from the slit of his tent was the town gate. It was quite a ways away, but Billy could see it. He stared at it thoughtfully. <strong>Is tonight the night?</strong> Billy was fascinated with death. He had died one-hundred-and-two times to zombies, sixty-seven times to infection, thirty-two times to cyanide, nineteen times to drug withdrawal, twelve times to dehydration, and four times to hangings. Billy was always looking for new ways to die. He had once jumped from the watchtower, but was caught halfway down by the crow. Billy liked the crow. Billy would often follow the crow around, knowing quite well where the crow was leading him.<br><br><strong>CrooooAAAAAoooooo</strong><br><br>Billy left his tent and immersed himself in the night, and looked straight up knowing quite well the crow would be flying directly above him. Billy waved to the crow.<br><br><strong>CrooooAAAAAoooooo</strong><br><br>The crow flew toward the gate; it‚Äôs black feathers disappearing into the night sky so that only its glowing red eyes could be seen. Billy locked his vision on the crow and followed. Billy had been bored with his last few deaths. He had tried jumping in a well, but the crow caught him and flew him out. He had tried slitting his wrists, but his skin grew back faster than he could cut. He had tried shooting himself in the head with a battery launcher, but had only received a headache. But the crow had summoned him from his tent this night, and Billy new the crow had something special in store for him. The crow always did. Once the crow had led him into the dessert far enough so that Billy died of dehydration. Billy had never thought of doing that before. Also, the crow had led Billy to open the gates seconds before thee attack. The zombies slammed into him like a tidal wave breaking every bone in his body. The last time the crow had led Billy, he brought him to a house where he had suffocated and died. Billy was ecstatic on where the crow would lead him tonight.<br><br><strong>CrooooAAAAAoooooo</strong><br><br>The crow shot into the town bank. Billy followed. Inside was a mess of random knick-knacks and animals. Tables of tools and boxes of food piled up against the walls like ivy. A few pigs and rats were in cages, and two giant rats were strapped to a post. The bank was illuminated by a single lantern, which hung in the middle of the room. The crow was standing on a table with semtex and detonators. Billy‚Äôs eye‚Äôs lit up. ‚ÄúThank you Mr Crow you‚Äôre a genius why have I never thought of blowing myself up!‚Äù<br><br><strong>CrooooAAAAAoooooo</strong><br><br>Susan Goodman hated that noise. The noise of the winged demon that plagued her eternal damnation. She watched the entrance to the bank as the last light faded from the sky. There was only a minute left of light. Her breaths started growing deeper. <strong>I don‚Äôt want to die anymore</strong>. Susan feared death, she loathed pain. Life was only prolonged death, but she planned on prolonging it as long as she could, hopefully forever.<br><br><strong>CrooooAAAAAoooooo</strong><br><br>There it was again. The chime of hells bells themselves. She shuddered in horror at the thought of what that ghastly monstrosity was doing here tonight. She considered poking her head out of her tent and searching for the monster, but was scared of a quote her brother had once told her. <strong>Be careful of noticing things. For when you notice something, it may notice you</strong>. She wished her brother were here now. He was much braver and stronger and wiser than she could ever be. She hadn‚Äôt seen him in an uncountable number of lifetimes.<br><br><strong>CrooooAAAAAoooooo</strong><br><br>She gasped in horror as the black beast shot into the town bank. Her mouth hung agape in horror. She lay frozen staring out of the slit of her tent, doubts starting to creep into her conscience. <strong>No‚Ä¶ No‚Ä¶ Just a trick of the mind‚Ä¶</strong> But then a man she didn‚Äôt recognize entered the bank. The darkness had fallen quickly, and the man wore it like a cloak, masking his identity in it. <strong>Oh dear</strong>. What could he and the crow be up to? Maybe he was chasing the crow, maybe he was trying to capture or kill it. She crawled along her stomach out of her tent. Maybe he needed help. Maybe they could get rid of this monster once and for all. With her brother‚Äôs face in her mind, she skulked toward the town‚Äôs bank.<br><br><strong>CrooooAAAAAoooooo</strong><br><br>Lewis Crysler removed his eye from his peeking hole to scan the sky. The bird had shouted a word, and he feared the word might be shouting it at him. The night hadn‚Äôt quite settled across the land yet and he was still visible, but he couldn‚Äôt contain himself. He squatted beside his first victim‚Äôs tent. He had been fantasizing about it for days. Ever since that thing he found in the desert, he had been dreaming of this night. At first he was disgusted by his thoughts, but soon he was consumed by his desire to consume. He had been watching her all day, and when she ducked inside her tent to rest for the night he had moved in for the kill.<br><br><strong>CrooooAAAAAoooooo</strong><br><br>Another demand. Lewis rose a bit higher to get a better look at the sky. The sun had completely disappeared and the world had gone black. Lewis kept looking into the sky but didn‚Äôt see the bird. He shrunk himself back up beside her tent and stuck his eye back into the hole he had chewed while she was away earlier in the day. She lay perfectly still and had her ears perked up as if trying to listen to something. <strong>Fuck is she on to me</strong>.<br><br><strong>CrooooAAAAAoooooo</strong><br><br><strong>No no‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs listening to the call of the crow</strong>. He watched as she lay there, almost perfectly still, only her back rose and shrank slightly from each breath. He started to dribble. The hot saliva was sweet. All of a sudden she went rigid, her entire body locked up and she gasped quietly. Lewis copied her; afraid he had made a mistake. He watched her stay like that for six seconds, and then saw her relax. He let out a quiet sigh of relief. <strong>Sleep sleep little sheep Lewis Crysler wants your meat</strong>. His eyes bulged in horror as she moved, slowly slithering into the blanket of darkness outside. Lewis watched as she slowly rose and made her way toward the town bank. He stalked silently behind her licking his teeth in anticipation.<br><br><strong>CrooooAAAAAoooooo</strong><br><br>Brandon Bigfeet stopped for a second, a chill running up his spine. The shriek of the crow always meant something VERY wrong was about to happen. He considered abandoning his ploy, but decided he had made it too far to quit at the sound of one bad omen. After all he couldn‚Äôt possibly be the only one with something to do on a night as dark as this. The shriek was probably for some other sorry schmuck. Brandon slipped into the bank just as the jaws of darkness sank into the earth. He lit the lamp with a match he had stolen a day ago, and began rummaging through the bank. <strong>I‚Äôll need a weeks worth of food and water, the chainsaw and machete, maybe a pig</strong><br><br><strong>CrooooAAAAAoooooo</strong><br><br>Brandon ignored the shriek. He couldn‚Äôt waste a second, if he was caught stealing from the bank he would be hung. His partner had been caught two nights ago, and when Brandon had looted his house he had found the map. All he needed was the resources to get there. He began throwing supplies into his ultra-rucksack and shopping trolley.<br><br><strong>CrooooAAAAAoooooo</strong><br><br>Again Brandon ignored the now closer shriek. <strong>Where‚Äôs that machete. It was here yesterday why is this place so disorganized</strong>‚Ä¶ Just then the crow darted in through the open doorway. Brandon yipped in surprise then dove into a crate. <strong>HOLY FUCKING SHIT HOLY FUCKING HELL IT‚ÄôS HERE FOR ME NO NO NO WHY ME WHY ME SHIIIIIIIT</strong>. He pulled the machete out from behind his back, finding it in the crate. He heard a single set of footsteps walk across the wood floor. ‚ÄúThank you Mr Crow you‚Äôre a genius why have I never thought of blowing myself up!‚Äù Brandon lifted his head out of the crate and watched the man fiddle with something on one of the tables. The crow was nowhere in sight. Brandon crept out of the crate, machete in hand, intent on finding the X on the map.<br><br><strong>‚ÄùFREEZE MOTHERFUCK-‚Äú<br>CHOMP<br>"AHHHHH"<br>BOOOM</strong><br><br>The crow watched from the top of the gate as his rewards were given out. Billy achieved his new and creatively painful death. Susan would meet her brother again in her next life. Lewis took a bite out of his long-lusted meal. And the explosion had shot Brandon‚Äôs unconscious body to the Oasis he and his partner had found a map to. But for those who had not acted upon the call of the crow, who had not exploited such a dark night, they would suffer the breakdown of one more town. The crow watched as the tiny people below him scrambled to loot the falling debris of the bank, and put out the fires of the explosion. Poor pitiful fools‚Ä¶ Chaos had come‚Ä¶<br></em></p>

                <p>A Post Apocalyptic Love Story<br>or Baby Needs Her Fix</p><p>Part 1</p><p>It started like it always does, boy meets girl and... well you know the rest. We were happy in the before-time, things were good and life was like a bright new day, shiny and full of the promise of good things to come.</p><p>I'll always remember the feeling i had that morning when i woke up and knew right away something had changed, the wind was blowing the sickly smell of ordure and rot and a blanket of silence lay over the entire town....something felt...wrong</p><p>One look out the window at the bodies in the street and i knew we had to leave, i started packing before she even woke up. I don't even think we had a destination in mind, just AWAY... anywhere had to be better that what was left of our once-lovely hometown.</p><p>We must have driven for days, i dont know how many they all blur into each other......... every gas station we came across was either unattended or scattered with corpses but we stopped long enough to refuel and grab some packaged food before setting out again.</p><p>I was scared out of my mind but i had to put on a brave front for her, she wasnt copeing well and spent long periods just blankly stareing out the window while we passed through towns and villages that had been dredged up from somebodys worst nightmare. Houses and buildings sprayed with gore,some of them had obviously been torn open by... something to get at the people inside. Their remains were scattered across lawns and gardens, i stopped to look the first time and wished i hadnt, some of those remains had what looked like bite marks on the bones.....</p><p>Eventually we found one, a thing-person... "it" was shambleing by the side of the road and turned to look at me as we slowed down. Half of its face was gone and blood was caked around its mouth and down the front of the tattered clothes it was wearing. I couldnt tell whether it has been a man or a woman but whatever it was, it just wasnt human anymore.</p><p>She started screaming at me to "drive DRIVE" and i quickly sped back up again but that was the breaking point, she barely spoke unless i asked her a direct question after that and even then she seemed numb and just mumbled part of a response before trailing off and turning to stare at nothing again...</p><p>I started trying to avoid built up areas, there were more of "them" wherever people had been and we found ourselves way out in the country near the desert, i stopped in a small town to scavenge for supplies and found a drugstore. I thought maybe they would have something that would help her get by and hastily grabbed an armload of different bottles of pills intending to sort through them once we were far away from any houses which might contain more of those things.</p><p>I had been driving all day everyday for what seemed like weeks so when i woke up the next morning bleary eyed and groggy i wasnt surprised i had fallen asleep hunched over the wheel after we ran out of gas someplace in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>I turned to make sure she was ok and saw the empty pill bottles scattered all over the car.. it was first thing in the morning and im not ashamed to say i sort of lost it, she was lieing there, awake but sort of vacant-eyed and i started screaming and shakeing her but she just smiled and told me to relax.</p><p>I was kind of shocked to hear her speak in a normal tone of voice and the last time i had seen her smile was several lifetimes ago so i stopped yelling right away. "Are you ok?" i asked and frantically started trying to read the pill bottles to see what she had taken and how much. Most of the labels were faded or gone altogether so i had no idea what to think or do, maybe i should try to make her vomit? eventually i calmed down enough to stop and take stock of our situation. We were out of gas with very few supplies and stuck out on the edge of the desert.</p><br><br><br><p><strong>stay tuned for next weeks episode kids! same bat-time. same bat-channel!</strong></p>

                <p>"A Post Apocalyptic Love Story"<br>or<br>"Baby Needs Her Fix"</p><p>Part Deux:</p><p>So there we were... smack damn in the middle of nowhere, no gas, no hope and no idea how things could possibly get any worse. Well we all know what happens when you tempt fate dont we?</p><p>It started as a faint echo reflecting off the few stunted trees still trying to eke out a living in this arid antechamber to hades...</p><p>I looked around not sure i had actually heard anything and after a moment returned to packing our meager food supplies into my backpack. After a minute or two i heard it again, this time much louder.. a long drawn out moaning.. part scream, part deathrattle.</p><p>It wasnt a sherlock holmes case, one of the things was obviously nearby and by the sounds of it.. coming closer...<br>I hurriedly threw the last few packets of stale chips and a half eaten chicken drumstick into my pack and got out of the car. She had loaded HER pack with nothing but bottles of pills, i wanted to say something but one look at the defiant expression on her face and i swallowed what i was going to say, took her hand and we set off down the road in the opposite direction from the noise.</p><p>The next few hours were a gruesome death march, we had to pass car after fuel-less car of dead people, each one a little stephan king novel in its own right. Here was the religious family that had died on their knees praying to a god that was surely incapable of mercy, there, another family with a more pragmatic approach. The father had shot his wife and 4 small children then turned the gun on himself... for miles afterwards i found myself wondering if they were the lucky ones.</p><p>Eventually we came to a gas station just as the sun was touching the horizon, we stopped for a moment and watched for any signs of movement but it seemed to be deserted. As we drew closer we had to skirt around a prime mover that had jackknifed in the parking lot.</p><p>Just as we passed the cab a gigantic THING burst out from underneath the pile of twisted metal and let out a spine chilling roar. It was so close i could SMELL the decay, there was no doubt this one had been a man, it towered head and shoulder above me and i just froze like a deer in the headlights.</p><p>I couldnt move, i couldnt think, all i could see was this monstrosity bearing down on me with the inevitable force of a tsunami. But my baby, she was something else~ she picked up a rusty length of chain that had been used to secure the trucks load and whipped it at the thing's leg shearing it off just below the kneecap. It faceplanted so close to me i could have reached down and touched it.... then she just started flailing at it like a madwoman, screaming at the top of her lungs. She had a two handed grip on the chain now and was using powerful overhand strokes... again and again and again.... after i came back to myself i turned to the side and just vomited, bits of its flesh were all over my face and clothing, i heaved until there was nothing left and then kept retching...</p><p>She put her hand on my shoulder as i wiped my mouth, i looked up with eyes that were still blurred by tears and just hugged her in a deathgrip like i never wanted to let go. "Shhh its ok its ok" she said and stroked my hair. Ive never been so proud in my life and realized that as long as we had each other it was worth going on.......</p><p>We scavenged some food and water from the gas station store but the pumps didnt work and i couldnt find any fuel anywhere. After spending a cold and sleepless night on the roof listening to the screams of the almost-dead echoing back and forth we set off down the highway.... together.....</p><br><br><br><p><strong>Stay tuned to DIEradio folks for the next installment in this thrilling RomZom drama!</strong></p>

                <p>Unwanted Birthrights</p><p>I don't know how many days we have held up in this dry, dark, rusted excuse of a town. But one thing that makes it a little less painful to bear is my father. My mother had died before we stumbled across this town. My father said it was because she was... weak and I had to be strong to survive in this world. My father had never lost a member of his group while scavenging the wastelands but the other groups weren't always so lucky. I tell my friends it's because my father is strong and brave and I will be just like him one day. My fathers group has been doing so well the town leader has disband all other groups to train with my father's group. But that's when the trouble started.</p><p>The next day my father's group lost their first member to the hoard. I remember everyone yelling and screaming at each other my father at them, them at my father. It scared me... but I must be strong I said to myself.</p><p>Everyday after that they lost another member... some days maybe 2. As the days went on I started to notice they were blaming my father more and more. Someone even said to my father "We know it's you and if we find out that it is..." My father would tell me they just needed someone to blame, that it makes life easier on the town and I should not worry. How naive I was.</p><p>As things seemed to get worse the gallows went up. All eyes were on my father and I could not understand why. My father must have known because he told me about a place where he had been storing food and supplies. Not long after that they hung him, leaving me to fend for myself in this world. But I must be strong.</p><p>Now I find it hard to work with the other townfolk and I think people are starting to distrust and shun me. While I was gone someone took everything from my house and said "It would be safer in the bank." I think it's time for me to leave this town.</p><p>As I am walking out of the gates I remember about my father stash of supplies. After searching under a few wrong rocks I find it, inside my father's hidding spot is some food, water and a note. It seems to be dated and is addressed to me. As I start reading it I realise that it is from my father. It talks about how he would give me and mother most of the food and water and it was making him weaker untill he stumbled across a corpse. He mentions almost starving so he ate some of the loose meat on the corpse. After that his writing gets harder to understand. It says something about an uncontrolable hungar and about how he had tried his best to repress it untill he took his hungar out on her. After that the note talks about my father needing to be strong for me, to resist.</p><p>As i'm walking away from that town listening to the siren echoing around me warning of tonights attack, I can't help but think about what my father's note said about him taking his "hungar" out on a her. Could it have been my mother? And what could he have done to the towns people to get himself hung? All I know is my father left me with questions and a mindset... I must be strong.</p>

                <p>Tears travelled down Cassandra's cheek as she sat on the padded floor in the tent, waiting for the inevitable. Daniel was sleeping in a cot a few feet away from her, or perhaps he had slipped into a coma. It was too hard to tell anymore.</p><p>In her quivering hands was a photograph of Daniel she had taken during their honeymoon in Montana last year. His "Save a Tree, Eat a Vegan" hat had been muddied from their hiking trip, but he still beamed with happiness as she photographed him in the glaring afternoon sun. He had bought the hat in a gift shop the day before the trip, solely because Cassandra was a long-time vegan. His quirky sense of humor was one of the many things she loved about him. She vowed to never forget the memories of their honeymoon since memories were about all she had left.</p><p>She glanced over to make sure he was still breathing, stroked his dark and wavy hair, and put the photograph on the floor. Her eyes were drawn to his journal which had fallen out of his hands some time during the night. He had started one a few weeks ago when they saw the announcement on the television telling them to move to a nearby refugee camp where more advanced medical facilities were available. Daniel had to give up his writing career when they moved since they now had higher priorities, mainly that of survival. Although it would never earn him any royalties, writing in a journal gave him a little peace of mind in a world where nothing was predictable and where nothing would ever be the same.</p><p>Turning to the last page on which he had written, Cassandra read his barely legible words with both fear and comfort, knowing it would likely be his last gift to her.</p><p>"March 8, 2013. My leg hurts bad. I know this is probably the end. The drugs help ease the pain but they don't hide the truth. There's still no cure for the bite and the infection is spreading. I know I don't have much time left, so I want to write this while my mind is still somewhat clear. Cassie, my life with you has been nothing but wonderful. You gave my life purpose when it had none. Never did I think I would find someone as beautiful and loving as you."</p><p>Although she wasn't finished, Cassandra stopped reading and wiped her eyes. The tears blurred her vision and made the last entry impossible to read. She grabbed one of Daniel's shirts on the floor, dabbed her eyes with it, and quietly sobbed as she clutched the journal tightly against her chest. She didn't want it to end this way.</p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted by someone yelling in the distance, "There's another one!" This sudden outburst reminded her of where she was and what was going to happen. She put Daniel's journal on the floor and wondered when she would have the strength to finish reading his final message, his final gift to her. Would it be days? Weeks? Months? She didn't know.</p><p>After drying her tears one last time, she put the photograph inside the journal and then covered the journal with the shirt to prevent it from being stained with blood. With trepid hesitation she picked up the pistol, turned to face Daniel, and waited, ignoring the single tear starting to make its way down her cheek.</p>

                <p><strong><em>One in the Chamber</em></strong></p><br><p>The 22nd of October, 24AC, was the day I was born, many people would call any of us born after the collapse an accident, though according to my father he couldn't have been happier to see my face when I was born. I later saw a birth of my friend William and can only assume that my birth was the same, a midwife quarantined off with the mother, with the rest of the town circling the area with weapons drawn just in case the child or the mother should die. It took me several years for the severity of the zombies at our gates to be thought of as a threat, around the age of ten I think common sense finally developed in my brain. It was about the time when my father would tell his stories of the past, the days before the zombies. No one really explained how the end came about, there were many theories, my father's was about a make-up company creating the zombie virus, something about Olay creating an anti-aging foam in a bottle that resembled the same container as a movie. We were young, sitting before the campfire at night, the stories we heard fables of a long ago kingdom that had boxes with motors in them, it fascinated us to no end. That's all they were to us, stories, too unbelievable that zombies didn't exist, or that large pieces of steel could fly through the sky.</p><p>Years passed, and the final gunshot was heard two weeks after my fifteenth birthday, the town had seen the last of the rounds that they had horded. It was the same day that my father told me that his most valued possession other then myself was under his bed, as he drank from a bottle of vodka, he also explained to me that it was one of the few things that let him wake up in the morning hoping that the day would be better. I learned a few weeks later why he was drunk that day, my father had been the one to shoot the zombie that night, my mother who had vanished right after my birth.</p><p>Soon after my father gained more responsibility, going on the expeditions that were now going further then they have ever gone before, apparently our luck had run out in the surrounding area, Christmas Michigan had nothing useful anymore. Our first warning of things to come was when the expedition team didn't come back, we waited several days after their scheduled return before we officially stated the news. The expedition team was dead, my father was dead, a friend tried to explain this as inevitable that someday he would die, that it just happened to be today that it happened. He soon found out that those are not the words to comfort a child, my father was untouchable before that, infallible, to have him taken away was something unimaginable.</p><p>It seemed like the world mourned his death as well, or maybe it was just the shaman that stayed in the town, the sky was black with dark clouds that flashed with lightning. The rain that fell down soaked into my bones as I stared up at the sky, the crack of thunder washing away the pain that seeped into me with every breath. When I went back to my father's shack, I had an excuse for my cheeks to be covered in water, and an excuse to sleep in a fever now sweeping over me. The next day, in a cold sweat I woke up, it sounded like the crack of thunder once again aroused me from sleep but it didn't seem to be raining.</p><p>‚ÄúThe horde, they've found us!‚Äù A yell rang out over the town's loudspeaker, and I was outside before my feet had time to register the ground. My vision was filled with the rotten flesh, if this is what my father ran into there was no way that he would have been able to escape. I stepped back as I realized that the end was near, the town watch was being pushed back hard. My heart hammered against my chest as the cold drops of sweat fell to my arm feeling as though it was burning me as the slam of my front door filled the blur of my vision, the couch hitting it like a truck. I knew it was selfish, that I should be outside with the others fighting off the undead, but fear made my choice for me as I went to my father's room, locking the deadbolt behind me as I sat beside the bed hoping that the zombies wouldn't notice me. Tucking my chin against my knees, I watched the door, the screams outside I knew would haunt my dreams should I survive this, my imagination working even harder with my fever, a sudden slam against the house making me scurry from the corner of the room under the bed.</p><p>Pushed against the wall at the head of the bed was a box of polished redwood lay against the floor, a small Celtic cross spread across the top of the box. Taking it in my hand I slid it to me, running my hand across the top of it as I heard wood groan then crack in the distance. Lifting the lid revealed a red silk inside, laying in the middle of it was a pistol and I took it into my hand the cold of its grip seemed to suck the heat out of my hand. It didn't seem to have anything in the clip, but a single round in the pistol, it made me laugh a little remembering my father's words. A single bullet loaded into a pistol, this was his precious treasure, the thing that let him live on through these days? Shaking my head I looked back just in time to see the door fly open, a man falling to the ground and his soulless eyes staring at me.</p><p>Thunder cracked out once more that night....</p>

Johnny was such a good guy‚Äù...</p><p>Once again his voice was filled with anger and grief. Understandable given the circumstances. But the rest of us felt differently. We weren't willing to go through another round of useless emotional complaints again. We were hungry and exhausted. We had too much to worry about to care about the grief of one of our companions.</p><p>There was no reply. We all walked silently and said no word. We were sick of his emotional outbursts, yet we cared enough not to tell him to shut up. As tears started filling up his eyes again, Joe, the leader of our expedition, ran off into the desert.</p><p>Victor was one of the last citizens that arrived in town seeking for refuge, and one of our companions in that expedition. A reliable man, if too outspoken in everyone's opinion. He stared at Joe, surprised.</p><p>‚ÄúWho the hell made that clown our leader?‚Äù, Victor complained. ‚ÄúThe idiot leaves us here and he has the machete with him.‚Äù</p><p>When Joe was gone, the rest of us stared at each other, wordless. Nobody wanted to chase him and console him. But we did felt a bit guilty about it.</p><p>‚ÄúWe shouldn't be too hard on the guy‚Äù, someone said. ‚ÄúYeah. Poor bastard's lost his little bro‚Äù, someone else added. I just listened to what they said. Not that I could really blame them. Dealing with the feeling of loss is never easy.</p><p>The fact was that none of us felt too sad. None of us felt we had lost anything. Joe's brother, Johnny was the most useless citizen in town. He would stay at home most of his time, never getting his hands dirty out in the construction sites or risking life and limb scavenging outside. From that point of view, he was nothing but dead weight for the town. Joe had always told us that Johnny had a heart disease since he was little, so he could barely do any physical work. The community was aware of it, and frankly we weren't happy about it. He was another mouth to feed and another daily water ration less in our well. These difficult times have reminded us that survival belongs to the fittest. More than often, we cannot afford to take care of the sick anymore.</p><p>The saddest thing was that Johnny was fully aware of his condition, but still he could not do anything to change it. He tried to be useful to town, delivering messages or doing whatever small tasks he could to help. But that wasn't enough. Joe didn't make things easier for us. Joe refused to risk his brother's life for the town, and constantly encouraged him to rest and avoid doing anything. Blood is thicker than water, they say, but we didn't appreciate that situation too much.</p><p>A few days earlier, our expedition had discovered an abandoned supermarket a few kilometers away from the town. Going there and returning would be an easy job, so we decided to leave it for later and focus on another expedition that would take us further way. However, Johnny learned about it and decided to go out to the desert by himself to prove his worth. That proved to be his fatal mistake. If anyone goes out to the desert and doesn't come back in two days, you can be sure you will never see them again. Joe knew it, and no matter how much he clung on to hope, he eventually had to accept the fact that Johnny was dead.</p><p>We continued our lives like usual. We cannot afford to stop and grieve over our neighbors' deaths. The undead come back every night. More and more every night. We cannot stop for a second.</p><p>Ever since that day, Joe started to complain and cry every day. And he often started acting erratically. He was assigned to be the leader of the expedition because he knew the way to the building we were going to explore. He had also discovered that supermarket, and had been the one to tell his brother about it. Guilt and anger must have become unbearable for him, and that day must have been his breaking point. We all were sick of his complaints and we weren't willing to keep supporting them. Perhaps he felt betrayed when he ran off. But he didn't come back. We also felt a bit of remorse and looked for him, but he was nowhere to be seen. It was getting dark, and our search efforts were fruitless. It was time to go back to town. Perhaps he had run off on purpose to find a way of leaving this world, hoping he would be reunited with his family on another.</p><p>Three days later. I woke up when I heard a strange noise outside. It was past midnight, so all zombies were gone. But it was a sound reminiscent of their footsteps. Someone walking slowly, shuffling their feet. Against my better judgment, I went outside to investigate. We didn't want a stray zombie to be walking out in town anyway.</p><p>When I reached the town's plaza, I felt surprised to see someone standing in the middle of it. Not just someone. A familiar face. There was Joe, staring at the sky. His face illuminated by the moonlight. Nobody thought he would make it back alive. He was talking. Talking to himself, lost in feverish delusion of pain and grievance. I got close to him. I don't think he saw or heard me, but I overheard what he said. ‚ÄúI am one with my brother now. He will live on forever inside of me‚Äù.</p><p>That morning, citizens were surprised to find a corpse in the middle of the plaza. A partially rotten and decomposed corpse. It was Joe. But he seemed different. Under his uniform, we saw his skin had already started to decompose, very much like the skin of a zombie. I had heard of them. Zombies that keep part of their human mind and memories, and barely show any signs of change. He had been killed when someone hit his head with a large rock. I left my home and walked to the plaza to see what had happened, pretending I didn't know about it. Poor Joe. When he found his brother's corpse, he should have known that the only thing a dead person leaves behind are their mortal remnants, and nothing can be done to bring them back to life.</p>

                <p><strong>Last Words</strong></p><p><em>The voices in my brain are driving me insane. Are? Or am? Am I insane because I hear voices in my brain, or is it that the voices drive me insane and I am still sane to be driven insane? Words. This all started with words. Words hold great power, if not all power. But what is power? Power is, what one would say is strength. But is it? Do words hold strength or power? Is power strength? Or is power something more omnipotent than strength, on a whole other tier. Can strength string together a chorus, which spreads chaos? Perhaps‚Ä¶ So yes. I think power is strength. And strength is power. And words‚Ä¶ Words are powerful. For you see, it is words, that tempt, my sanity. Why else would I shake and writhe and spit and whine? Because the voices in my mind are alive! It all started with words. Words which built up. They brought me here. And how do I feel about this? For feeling is what? An emotion, or a thought‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I think I did once, but I forgot. Forgot the words to explain or the whole memory? Is a memory made of words? Is everything a word? Or are words just labels? When I think I hear words, words which stack to make sentences to make thoughts or memories or emotions. Anger is an emotion. But anger is a word. And when I think of anger I think hot, and hot is a word. Heat produces energy, and energy produces power. Power is not in words, words are power. And I have words. Many many words. Does that make me powerful? Or am I just a host? A host to these words in which the voices in my head speak? That man. That damn man and his damn words. He brought me here. Now. And he awoke the voices. Or did the voices awaken him? Were the voices even in me to start, or did his words birth them? I believe that the voices are always in me but I didn‚Äôt believe that until they were always with me. And they are always with me but was there a time when there wasn‚Äôt? Am I just a voice myself? A voice all the other voices are voicing off to? Is this meat I wear my meat or am I myself a voice who stole it from another? Am I that man, his words‚Ä¶ They billowed from his mouth‚Ä¶ And they broke me‚Ä¶ They made me‚Ä¶ I am but words now, and I always was. And so are you. He lay there in the heat. A crumpled mess of meat. So dry, all his life sucked up by the sky! The sun, it burned! But what is the sun? The sun is energy, which is why it is so hot. For energy produces heat, and energy produces power. Power is words, and so the sun is a word. The more they sing and cry and shriek, the more more more more more more more more more life grows bleak! Bleak not because of understanding. Bleak because everything is a word. Sun, moon, sky, sand, death, life, love, hate! All around me! Words! All starting from that man lying in the sand. And from him to me to Paul and Saul! Across the lands, the sands, I see! And who knew, that the simplest of stories could spark such a cry! But the simplest of cries can awaken the whole horde, as I know. The man in the sand told me a simple story, one I am unwilling to share now, because it has been quieted, let loose. Now, everyone, all around, has stories to tell. Each story‚Ä¶ Brought forth life! Life to the land! And now I sit here with a pen in my hand, and for what? Words? That is all I am, blood, skin, heart, brain, soul. Words! And within words are more words! Thoughts, feelings, emotion! And within those are the voices, who spectate and make sanction for more words. The words. The words that make up sentences which make up my predicament. I sit here, thinking, listening, writing, I am words, I create words, for words create me. All from the man in the sand with his final story. Blood. Blood encased him. Crumpled mess. Bloody fuss. Cough. Lots of that. He was made of words and from his lips words erupted. A simple story, of his past. He spoke. Snap. Boom. And the voice in my brain started to sing. Sing his story. And then later, at a pub ‚ÄúOut of The Sun‚Äù, an epic tale by a cannibal! A story of love and loss, the loss of the Unbalanced Counties. And poof, another voice, not a new voice, for no new words are around. Because words are already here, you see, and to label something with a ‚Äúnew‚Äù word would be false. For the thing was already a word, and the label you put to the thing is a label of the word! Words are infinite! And so are their combinations! Stories! Songs! Another singing voice in my brain, ‚ÄúLight My Fire! Give me every desire!‚Äù And the soliloque by the runt! Out by the fire upon looking into the mound of burning corpses he opened his mouth and let loose another voice in my head! I hear it still. Over and over and over again! Another story, an apology left at the gates, signed and sealed. Never spoken, but sing in my brain by a voice none the less. All inside, all inside, all waiting to come outside. A pen in my hand, and a burning will to write, but what about the plight I will create. Am I willing to push the big red button to drop the big red bomb? Who am I to inspire? Who am I to lead? I am but a shallow hungry collection of words. Many many words, many many who hold power. I simply radiate power then, for the words want to come out. And so I sit with this pen and paper and write. I write to indict. I spell each word out carefully, silently, for the accursed winged beast took my tongue when I sung. And now silence. But words ache, words shake, words will themselves out. Am I me? This thought now, is it me? Or is it words with a will, a will that they bend me to. Do what the words want or want what the words offer? All started from the man in the sand. Hungry, silent, alone. I sit and I write, and I write to indict! Final words left behind, they find me. If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it does it make a word? Even if it isn't heard it makes a word. And I hear it, not me, but the voices, and they sing it to me. I hear not the word then. Do I? If the voices shriek it and I hear it do I hear the word or the voices? Another voice! Another voice! And it sings a tale of a dog named Mitzer. Hmm. Hah. And I hear it over and over and over again. The words come to me and I need to release them. If I do not what will happen? No tongue to let my words out through the front. And so I sit and I write them out this way. But I fear for myself. What when the stories leave me. A final goodbye is screamed into the night, and it comes to me. Not me but the voices. Or do the voices go to the words and then come to me? I am not the voices so I do not know. No. No. Write. Write a story, that is what I must do. Almost out of ink. Almost out of think.</em> <strong><em>MUST WRITE WITH WORD. BLOOD. BLOOD. BLOOD. MUST RELEASE. WHEN I TOLD THE MAN IN THE SANDS STORY THE VOICE QUIETED. IT IS QUIET. QUIET. BUT WORDS ARE POWER. WHAT WHEN I QUIET ALL WORDS. I LOOSE POWER? BUT WHAT GOOD IS POWER? WHAT GOOD IS STRENGTH? WHEN WORDS RULE ME? AND WORDS AREN‚ÄôT MY WORDS THEY ARE WORDS WORDS WORDS! WORDS FROM LIPS I NEVER SEE WORDS FORM LIPS I NEVER HEAR‚Ä¶ AM I SANE STILL? VOICES ENGULF. SO LOUD. ANOTHER! ANOTHER TWO! ANOTHER THREE! THEY SWALLOW SWALLOW SWALLOW ME!</em></strong></p>

                <p>A Riot Shield Cannot Protect Your Heart</p><p>Gone are our days as the apex predator. Gone are the days that we shaped the world to our will. Gone are the days we could go forth into the world, confident and careless, secure in mankind's superior status. Now we huddle in our wretched, little towns, living our wretched, little lives, until we inevitably meet our wretched, little deaths. Telling indeed, is it that the foremost of the Town's Watchmen, the Brotherhood of Guardians, bear not a destructive gun, nor a mighty spear, nor a swift sword, but a defensive shield. <em>‚ÄúDon't get me wrong; I have nothing but respect for the Brotherhood. Hell, I guess I might be considered an honorary member nowadays. But they are passive, not active. They defend humanity, but do not fight for it. But I digress, and I have a story to tell.‚Äù</em> Even in this endtime, however, even in this world of walking corpses, scouring sands, and relentless heat, there are some who dare to go out and plumb the World Beyond for the treasures that are hidden there. The bravest amongst us (<em>and I count myself among this venerated group, not to make to much of a big thing of myself</em>) dare to draw near the buildings that are the pitiful remnants of our lost civilization. For while these buildings are rich in valuable resources, they are also what is technically known as ‚Äú<em>absolutely crawling with the buggers, you can't go two feet without hitting one of 'em</em>‚Äù, to quote a noted expert. Among these bravest there is a certain, select, one might say ‚Äúelite‚Äù group. This subset is not known for their bravery, daring, courage, gumption, or altruism. This group is known for their insanity. For what sane man (<em>or woman, the group is fairly evenly divided by gender, though I think that us men might have an edge on them in insanity in numbers, if not intensity</em>)would enter a warren of zombies and poison? I am talking, of course, about those buildings commonly known as Explorable Ruins. ‚Äú<em>Though I tend to call them Damnable Labyrinths</em>.‚Äù It was during my first expedition to one of these ruins, an old hospital, my initiation in the way of the wandering aimlessly, if you will, that I happed upon him. We tend to go by nicknames, so we just called him Shield, as he was the only one of the Brotherhood among us. It was a fairly average expedition, though I was simply by going by the word of my companions at the time, as I was fairly inexperienced, though some of my knowledge from exploring normal buildings transferred over. We had decided to split our group of eight into four groups of two, because frankly, we had too much ground to cover, and we could only stay in those places for about 5 minutes before the mysterious gas that covered the area took us out of commission. Funnily enough, by doing a multitude of experiments that involved pushing people we didn't like into the ruin and locking the doors, (<em>we don't have unlimited chains, you know!</em>) we had discovered that the amount of exertion one underwent appeared to have no effect on the time limit. For some reason or another, it was hardlocked at about five minutes before we collapsed. Unless we had to run from zombies, which for some reason drastically increased our gas intake. Don't ask me why that's how things are, I have no idea myself. Aaaaaannnnnnyyyyywwwwaaaaaaaayyyyy, this all led to the fact that we weren't walking, jogging or running through the halls. We were sprinting as fast as our malnourished, vitamin-deficient legs could take us. Shield and I were paired up, as I'm sure you've figured out. Hell if I know how he was keeping up, lugging that heavy, bulky, monstrosity (<em>well I know now, it all lies in momentum, balance, and mysterious training that you don't have the clearance to know about, but at the time I was completely flabbergasted</em>) and keeping up with me, but he was doing fine. We hit seven rooms, two of which were locked, unfortunately, and managed to find some assorted drugs, a blueprint for some reason (<em>I had no idea why the blueprints for what turned out to be giant statue of a crow were in a hospital, my guess is we had entered the psychiatric ward at some point</em>), a mattress, which I had somehow strapped to my back, and an empty vending machine. Which Shield was balancing on his riot shield, defiance of all sense, logic, and physics. Anyway, we were on our way out with about two minutes to spare (<em>hell yeah we're fast!... though the drugs might've helped</em>) when we hit a zombie. We fled and I somehow felt we only had about a minute and a half now. Then we hit another one. One minute. All of a sudden, things were urgent. By my count, the exit was about 30 seconds away. We couldn't afford losing another 30 seconds of air. Then we ran into another zombie. Only this one had three of his buddies with him. We idled, wasting 10 precious seconds, before Shield slammed all of them into the wall with his shield, dropping the vending machine (<em>seriously, how the hell was he balancing that? I've gotten training, and I still can't do anything like that</em>). ‚ÄúGo!‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúI'll keep them pinned!‚Äù Well far it be from me to dishonor his sacrifice, so I waltzed out of there, safe and sound, pausing only to grab the blueprint from his belt (<em>and I will always regret wasting time on that useless thing</em>). I quickly exited the ruin, meeting up with the rest of my group. And then I promptly broke down. Yeah, I turned on the waterworks. Wailing, crying, keening, screaming. I supposed I wasn't as cool-headed back then, but honestly... I might react the same today. He had sacrificed himself for me. To save my life. After nearly 15 minutes of gasping, wheezing, and choking, both from the anguish and the mysterious gases, I managed to stop, and delivered our, well my, I guess, finds to the group leader. Gears, a solemn man with a toolbelt at his waist, just smiled sadly at me and took the blueprint, the drugs, and the mattress. We then spent another hour hashing out a map of the place based on our movements. Because we would be going back tomorrow, once our lungs cleared up some (<em>hey, I said we were crazy</em>). I set my Screaming Alarm Clock (<em>it's a really long story for how got that thing</em>) to an hour before we agreed to wake up. In the morning, I got up, and quickly silenced my clock. Luckily no one else had roused from their places around our campsite. We had spread out some, so that the zombies wouldn't focus in on us too much, anyway, so no one was that close together. I walked over to our supplies, and grabbed a Battery Launcher Mk. II and two batteries. If all went well, I'd only need one, but hey, better safe than sorry. I walked over to the entrance to the hospital, braced myself physically and mentally, and rushed in. What I found in there... well it wasn't pretty, and it was moving. It wasn't a tough job, it wasn't a tenth of what he had been. I did what I had to do, grabbed his riot shield, struggled with the vending machine for a minutes to no avail, and got out of there. I took it upon myself to remember this man, this Hero, who went only by Shield, because in the vast and cruel world that we inhabit, if I didn't remember him, there might not be any who would. And because he saved my life from the ravening maws of vicious and voracious beasts. That tends to stick in the mind. I think you can see where this going. I took up his shield, took over his name, and took on his mantle. I became the new Shield. <em>I am Shield, and I will fight the undead until humanity reclaims its rightful place.<br></em><br>-Taken from the writings of Shield, Hero of the Palisades of Misplaced Falsehoods, Savior of the Caverns of Broken Tears, etcetera.<br>Writing dated to between 13-16 A.O. Approximately 12 to 15 years before the establishment of what scholars have agreed was the first of the permanent walled cities.</p>

                <p>Congrats Blaire! <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br>Okies I got my creative chi flowing too</p><p><strong><br>Chased</strong><br>Shadows silently flickered down corridors and empty alleyways as I hastily creep down the abandoned street. Not knowing if it is a trick of my eyes or something else, I pad down the sidewalk on my tiptoes, head up, eyes alert and rucksack full on my back. Trying to breathe lightly, I inhale through my nose and exhale through my mouth, increasing speed; I need to get home quickly. <br>Home. The word reverbs in my head like the old bass I used to play. The days before it all happened. Over seven days have passed since the zombies first came. They came in hordes eating everyone in their path, ripping the intestines from the living, feasting on lacerated corpses and leaving devastation and chaos in their wake. Now everyone is gone. <br>Sweat beads on my forehead, drips to my lip and I turn my head to the left and blow it away. I can hear my footsteps echo down the street. Suddenly, the footstep echo quickens. My ears perk, pupils dilate and I increase my pace. Long silhouettes dance from behind me and I know It‚Äôs following me. My right arm tenses, knowing the bowie knife attached to my belt will soon be in my palm.</p><p>I‚Äôve never killed a zombie, but I am prepared to. I was lucky; when They first came I was walking home and as the slaughter began, I ran into a motorhome in someone's backyard and hid there watching the onslaught through a slit in the blind. Within a few days, everyone was dead and the covey of zombies had lurched onwards to the next town. Undead stragglers were left behind, hungry and alone; they were savage and quick enough to prey on unfortunate cats and rats and birds.</p><p>Running faster, I hear the zombie's ragged breath, seemingly tickling the back of my neck. I smell Its stench, like rotten innards and body odor, the scent permeates through my nose. My heart is in my throat choking me, my body is trembling and my brain says: <strong><em>NOW!</em></strong> <br>With blind terror driving me I grab my knife, pull it high behind my ear and pivot around on the ball of my foot. Closing my eyes I slash the knife in a sweeping motion towards the zombie. I feel hot goop spray across my face and arms. I slash again, and again and again. <br>My hands have cramped around the knife handle.Opening my eyes I look down at my hands dripping with blood. Red droplets and spray cover the sidewalk: my Picasso-esque tribute to the apocalypse. My gaze focuses on my opponent. Barely recognizable, moaning, blonde tousled hair streaked with red, It writhed on the concrete like some demonic animal . I step forward cautiously peering at the corpse. Suddenly its swollen eye opens a slit, exposing a bright blue iris focused right at me. A tear zigzags down the grimy cheek, <em>‚ÄúI thought I was the last‚Äù</em> rattles from deep in its throat. Then it is still. <br>My eyes open wide in disbelief. A vertigo-like dizziness hits me severely. My heart plummets into my stomach. I gag and choke down my own vomit. Leaning on a wall I, count to 10 and breathe deeply. I stand up straight, adjust my pack on my back and still riding my adrenaline rush, and proceed jogging in the direction I was headed. No footsteps echoing this time as I chant in tune to my rhythmic step ‚Äú It was just a zombie, just a zombie‚Äù .</p>

                <p>**Nuclear Family<br><br>We‚Äôll never make it. Half our town will be biten, eaten, and transformed tonight. My friends and maybe even me will add to their already imposing number. <br>All this because we listened to the wrong madman. <br><span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span> found a blueprint for a nuclear reactor yesterday and he said we could even build it! Have you ever heard something so ludicrous: ‚ÄúWe can build a Nuclear Reactor if only we had an engine.‚Äù Laughable. <br>I suppose, however, that I‚ÄôM the bigger idiot here, because I believed <span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span> and ignored our shaman. Our shaman who already proved he could keep us safe with just a soul! he used <span class="tid_user tid_user_834917 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="834917">SnicKer</span> two day ago to summon an angry rain to melt our siegers. And yesterday again but with <span class="tid_user tid_user_77644 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="77644">Dave</span>‚Äôs soul. He said he could easily do it again tonight, at least i think that‚Äôs what he promised. Sometimes his dialect is a little hard to understand, one thing is for certain, he wants a soul. <br>A soul.<br>A nuclear reactor. <br>How on earth are these two things our only viable options?<br>Well no one wanted to get their precious hands dirty. And we were out of souls so‚Ä¶<br><br>So here I am with <span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span> searching this old gas station for an engine. I‚Äôm so thirsty but I‚Äôve been doing this long enough to know how to get the most out of the little water I have. So I go thirsty while i rummage through the building and garage. Amazing that just 12 hours ago i was excited and hopeful of the future. Before i realized <span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span> was just as mad and half as useful as that shaman. <br>‚ÄúLets inventory what we‚Äôve found so far shall we?‚Äù <span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span> suggests with nothing but exhaustion in his voice. He pushed himself from behind the building covered in grease. <br>He could probably taste the contempt I had for him in my glare but I doubt he cared. <br>‚ÄúSure‚Äù The one word was more than he deserved but i wanted him to see his failure so I opened my bag and emptied my pockets. ‚ÄúWhat were we looking for again <span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span>? Oh right an engine, well let‚Äôs see if I‚Äôve found one‚Ä¶ I found a couple batteries those are real useful. And what‚Äôs this? Some dried out Candy that‚Äôs pretty cool right? That will save us from those monsters for sure‚Äù he nodded ignoring my criticism as if above me. ‚ÄúI found some steroids as if our town doesn‚Äôt have enough of those too <span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span>‚Äù <br>‚ÄúOh great!‚Äù Here comes his annoying optimism again. Like he has some sort of control over the situation. Looking at his stupid face an amazing idea comes to mind. An idea which will make me the hero of our town. ‚ÄúThose are just what we need!‚Äù He smiles confidently and pets his dog. ‚ÄúMark Scruffalo can use those to carry our engine back to town!‚Äù<br>Have you ever heard, or seen something which disproves everything you believe, everything you know? Most people react with anger if something suggests that their closely held beliefs are incorrect. But when you actually see proof that you were wrong and you must accept it as truth you feel like a fool. Some people still react angrily when they feel that way, I guess I‚Äôm not that type of person.<br>‚ÄúOur engine? You found an engine! That‚Äôs great! quick, there‚Äôs still time we can get it home where is it?‚Äù<br><span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span> laughed and took me around back and showed me the engine still trapped in an old minivan, surprisingly untouched by rust. ‚ÄúSo, do you know how to get an engine out of a car?‚Äù <br>I shake my head but i‚Äôm still smiling because I‚Äôll push that van back if i have to. <br>‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôre in luck buddy because I know, I know how to get an engine out of this vehicle. Let‚Äôs get to work‚Äù<br>And work we did. For two hours we grunted and swore twisting and pulling and using whatever we could to leverage the hunk of oily metal out of its case. Finally, exhausted, we collapsed: the savior of our town had been wrested free. <br><span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span> opened his canteen and drank the hot water offering me a swig. ‚ÄúYou left your water with your batteries and candy right?‚Äù I nodded and drink the generous gift of refreshment. <br>The sun was starting to set. I stood up to stretch my back, looks like i‚Äôll be the hero of the town after all. ‚ÄúSo <span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span>, what else did you find?‚Äù <br>He stretched too and laughed a little, ‚ÄúI found a mattress, should give us a little bit of a barricade for the town don‚Äôt you think? And this little box cutter, some food, and a decent piece of wood also this cool elastic band.‚Äù<br>I smile at him ‚ÄúWhat are we going to do with that band? it‚Äôs not worth bringing along!‚Äù<br> ‚ÄúWell, no we‚Äôll need it to fix the engine but don‚Äôt worry we got all the parts for the engine‚Äù<br> I blinked, I never even considered the engine being broken. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù <br> ‚ÄúYeah totally just need a bone to keep the band in place and we‚Äôre all good‚Äù He patted my shoulder. <br> ‚ÄúThe shaman took our bones <span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span>. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs already used them for whatever he uses them for‚Äù<br> <span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span> sighed and quickly slid a sharp razor around my throat making a warm necklace. I grabbed my neck and turned around quickly. <br> ‚Äúwe‚Äôd never get the reactor built in time tonight anyway‚Äù<br> The blood felt warm like the water from the canteen as it flooded my windpipe and erupted from my lips. <br> <span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span> pushed me down and I watched him slide the little knife from my knee to my hip. I felt nothing, but heard a scratch as my vision faded. <br> ‚ÄúSorry buddy, they say all you leave behind is your bones, and your soul and we need both‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

                <p><strong>Boots in the Sands</strong></p><p>The warriors had offered to die. They had given their utmost charity to keep the loose town together. By the Sun's set, they would be dead, after all it only took the crazies five minutes to bite off one's fingers. The warriors were not cowards, not burdens to the residents. The armed stood front with daring spears at their hips... waiting for the moans.</p><p>Whether it was meant to be, Arnold knew there was no turning back. He held his wooden club behind the alignment of guards with spears. Arnold rustled his curly black hair, nervous about the upcoming event. He glanced at the glamorous sunset. Jubilant colors skyrocketing out and calling out for merciless death.</p><p>Among the warriors on steep hill, Arnold looked to his left to see a panting friend. The red-faced teenager was holding a splintered club like his in shaky hands. ‚ÄúYou okay, Scott?‚Äù Arnold admired his buddy. Arnold let out a drawn out sigh as he watched the valley below darken.</p><p>‚ÄúPeachy,‚Äù Scotty replied, patting his wooden club with unsure hands. Scott's ruffled blonde hair was overshadowed by a bandana he had strapped across his forehead. Scotty only came since Arnold volunteered for the duty. The two highschoolers were in it together, plus Scotty didn't want to be a wuss and wuss out.</p><p>The front row held out their spears. ‚ÄúSet!‚Äù A loud voice erupted from a spear-wielding punk. Santiago set his foot into the sands, ‚ÄúPosition!‚Äù He called out with a rough voice, gritting his teeth. Santiago turned and winked at Scotty and grinned. ‚ÄúHead up, Scotty boy.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúCan it, Santiago.‚Äù</p><p>'Hey, hey. No need to get mad, boy-o,‚Äù Santiago turned to eye Arnold with his rumpled up hair. ‚ÄúGet that club ready to bash in these sickos, alright?‚Äù Santiago jeered, snickering at Scotty again.</p><p>‚ÄúOh yeah, I'm more than ready,‚Äù Arnold joked, ‚Äúmaybe the sickos'll leave us once they see your buzzcut.‚Äù</p><p>Santiago dropped his grin into the sand dunes with his feet. A week ago, before the barber took to being dead, Santiago and his crew had went to get clean buzzcuts. Scotty quit his panting and chuckled as he looked up and looked at Santiago's buzzcut. He turned and saw Santiago's two friends, Jonsie and Todd, flaunting their funny looking hair.</p><p>‚ÄúYeah, yeah, okay,‚Äù Santiago shifted his feet and went to face the back. ‚ÄúI'll be back, Arny and Scotty.‚Äù Santagio blew through the sea of warriors with worthless clubs and past the sling-shooters who cowered when they saw Santiago's might. Where was he?</p><p>Santiago squinted, covering his eyes from the rising sand in the air. ‚ÄúWhere's Archie?‚Äù He asked a boy packing pellets into his pocket. The boy continued on, showing no interest in the punk that could rip him into halves. ‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù Santiago hissed.</p><p>The sling-shooter looked up, ‚ÄúOh it's you. I saw Archie loading the carts when we left.‚Äù</p><p>Santiago smiled grimly. ‚ÄúYou realize that was twenty minutes ago, correct?‚Äù</p><p>He nodded. ‚ÄúGet outta my face please, I have to separate my ammunition.‚Äù<br> Santiago scowled, cursing through his teeth. ‚ÄúDoes anyone know where Archie is?‚Äù No hands pipped or words uttered, only the clanging of weapons. Santiago shot a look at Arnold, trying to dig an answer out of him.</p><p>‚ÄúHey Santiago!‚Äù A dimwit bellowed, ‚ÄúArchie's that short stack, ya?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúYes, Todd. Have you seen him?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúYou betcha, I saw him like four days ago brushing his teeth.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI'ma pummel his face in when I see him!‚Äù Jonsie exclaimed, turning around with a fist in the air. ‚ÄúHe jacked my toothbrush!‚Äù</p><p>Santiago sighed. If they didn't get that payload here, they would have just wasted time. Would it better better to pull back and defend the gates? Oh how he wished to see that short stack-</p><p>‚ÄúComing through!‚Äù A voice yelled from behind two wooden carts nearing the warriors. ‚ÄúGo, go, go!‚Äù Archie shouted and pushed forward the energized carts. He smiled and clapped, wiping sweat from his face. ‚ÄúHey Santa!‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúIt's Santiago and where were you?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúOh boy, not this. The others told me to help them put a padlock on the gat-‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThey locked us out?!‚Äù Santiago screamed, stabbing his spear into the sand's vegetation. He closed in on a fear stricken Archie.</p><p>‚ÄúNegatory, well, kind of.‚Äù</p><p>The eyes of Santiago lit up, flustering with rage. ‚ÄúNo, no, no...‚Äù Santiago raked his hands through his greasy buzzcut. ‚ÄúWe're bait.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúNo way!‚Äù Before Archie could quiver in surprise, the sling-shooters jumped into the wooden carts and pushed forward with two people pushing on each cart. Santiago could only turn to see his warriors dive into a battle with no gain.</p><p>-</p><p>The roars of undead came first. Arnold rushed forward, slapping his club against a sicko's face. He heard an uttering crack, and let the sicko sway his arms in the air as he fell. Arnold caught his breath, a sandy one at that.</p><p>‚ÄúWait up, broski,‚Äù Scotty said, patting his friend on the back. ‚ÄúLet's go, I'm ready.‚Äù</p><p>Arnold blinked, rubbed his eyes, and scratched at his throat. He was parched and hadn't drank since the morning before. Now at midnight, his stomach grumbled. He was ablazed with a rush of exhausting energy.</p><p>The elongated spears kept the enraged crazies at bay for a while. It seemed to work out until three crazies took down a quarter of the group. Packs of undead swarmed the rest, with Todd trying to keep order. He must've asked himself where Santiago was. Where was he anyways? Todd would never know since he was overwhelmed by cold teeth that snapped fingers off in about five minutes.</p><p>‚ÄúHoly...‚Äù Scotty watched, losing grip of his club. ‚ÄúLet's do this, dude.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúNo, look.‚Äù Arnold pointed. His finger which could snapped off by cold teeth in about five minutes showed the way to the endless masses of dead overthrowing the warriors. It all went by fast, the sling-shooters desperately blasting indents into skulls, but not fast enough. ‚ÄúGame over, man, game over...‚Äù</p><p>-</p><p>The tiresome Santiago moved through the frosty desert winds. His spear went ahead of him with each step towards the town's front gates. His swift movement stood no chance against the force of the strong winds. Along with that, Santiago had begun worrying.</p><p>He had told the nerd to alert the army about the betrayal and to gather up when they could. Santiago hoped they would come in one piece. He hadn't had time to warn them himself. He had to get to the town before they were swarmed.</p><p>‚ÄúAlmost there...‚Äù</p><p>Santiago soon saw the glint of torches that centered the fort. He passed over a mossy, wet pile of logs and a heap of scrap cans. Santiago could use some spam. Maybe a sandwich? Don't get ahead of yourself, he thought.</p><p>‚ÄúCome on, come on...‚Äù The angered punk charged through the shearing wind, only making a few feet's worth of progress. ‚ÄúDamn you!‚Äù He shouted at the gates. ‚ÄúDamn you if you can hear me!‚Äù He couldn't make it, but he was so close. He and the others weren't going to die for the scum they were protecting.</p><p>Through the gleaming light, he grabbed the metal gate. He pounded his fists to it, hearing it rebound and echo out. Thus, echoing out to the creepy shadows shambling towards him. Those weren't his boys, they were sickos.</p><p>‚ÄúDon't you do this,‚Äù He pounded his knuckles harder ad harder. ‚ÄúYou just don't do this!‚Äù He kicked and took a step back before gutting the padlock with effortless ease, letting it drop into the sands like his feet.</p><p>He shoved through the gates with a thrust of frustration. He shut the gates behind him, letting it rebound and echo to the closing in sickos. Santiago aimed his spear at what he saw first. Eyes watching him from their tents.</p><p>‚ÄúStop!‚Äù A grumpy man with a full grown beard edged through his hovel, a dwelling composed of a bent wooden plank and some rusty nails. ‚ÄúStand back, you.‚Äù</p><p>Santiago held his spear tighter. Without a doubt, the tip was damaged permanently. ‚ÄúYou know my name, Albert.‚Äù<br> ‚ÄúGo back, now. I mean it.‚Äù<br> <br> Santiago took the hit. ‚ÄúFor what, huh, just so you can lock me out again with my boys dying back there?‚Äù He craned his neck towards the tiny crowd gathering, looking for answers.</p><p>A skinny water boy held up his hand, ‚ÄúWe voted. Take some water if you want.‚Äù He tossed it, the water showering Santiago's feet in the sand. The precious water was as good as gold, and the skinny water boy had just done so to waste it.</p><p>‚ÄúYou say something, kid?‚Äù Santiago scoffed, raising his spear. A gasp spread through the residents Santiago had tried to be their savior. Instead, now they were shocked at him. ‚ÄúYou shit!‚Äù He grunted as he leveled the spear above him. ‚ÄúAh!‚Äù</p><p>Before he could react, a fist struck his nose and sent a chilling crack through the air. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He muttered, soon feeling a burst of pain in his gut as a multitude of punches met him. Santiago faltered back after someone with a miniature knife went into his shoulder.</p><p>An ungodly scream left Santiago's throat as he tried to regain his balance with his feet in the sand, but ultimately collapsed to the floor with a sorrowful cry. He landed outside into the cold, barren, dark wasteland outside. The only light had marked the shadows of the dead getting closer and closer.</p><p>The poor punk looked up from the entanglement of vegetation as Albert went to seal the gates once and for all. ‚ÄúYou son of a...‚Äù Santiago tried to keep the gates open with a hand, but felt his bones ache and was sent down... Through the darkness, only the shutting of the gate's echoed, followed by ghostly, rising moans.</p><p><img src="../../../../gfx/square/zombie.png" alt=":zombie:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p><strong>If I Bleed For You..</strong></p><p><em>Blood oozes from the neck wound and filters through my fingers as his wide open eyes twitched for the last time before freezing into a dull, eerie glaze. I yank my silvery love free of his throat. Its red smile glistens when it leaves, being thrilled and pleasured by the feeling of its first living kill. Blood spurts out from the wound, catching my shoulder, soaking my sleeve, and staining the sands as I stare into the lifeless eyes.</em></p><p><strong><em>My gaze drew from our victim and to my love, which stands aloft in shimmering brilliance of sunlight with droplets of red falling from its fine curves. I hold my love happily upwards to boast its accomplishment, keeping it tight in my one-handed grasp. I gently bring its broad side to my lips and kiss it softly, feeling the stimulating metallic texture bring warmth to my heart and soul. Red dribbles from my mouth, down my chin, and onto the face of our victim.</em></strong><br><em><br>I hadn't doubted my love's capabilities and it hadn't failed me. I move back over the body, steadying on my knees as I carry up the head of our victim into my chest with my open arm. I cradle our victim and thank him for his sacrifice as I plunge my love into his side, cutting deep into the liver. He jiggles limply as I stab firmly. Slowly sliding my love through his flesh, allowing it to savor the feeling of flesh.</em></p><p><strong><em>But my love grew tiresome of this flesh.<br>As our victim's body loses its final essence of life each second, my love demanded fresher flesh.<br>"But my sweet love," I whisper. "I said we'd only do it once.."<br>It is quiet.<br>"Yes, my love. I did enjoy it too. I love to see you happy, but.."<br>It remains silent.<br>I sigh and say, "As you wish, my love."</em></strong></p><p><em>I let go of our victim, watching him drop onto the ground, sending up a small cloud of blood-stained sand. He fell so sadly, like a child maturing and letting go of its stuffed companion for the last time, seeing no more magic in the object. There he lays, the red tainted sand clung to his clothes, to his lips, and to his eyes without even the slightest of reactions. He is so idle and hallow. I had known him well, and he was a good fellow. He was the favored scavenger of the town ever since his discovery of an old, rusty engine. The engine was used to make a chainsaw which had helped out the town considerably with the nightly attacks by the rotten. It's powerful teeth tore through the rotten's bones and tendon with brutal force, making slaying them a joyous and simplistic task.</em><br><strong><em><br> My love immediately began to grow deeply envious of it, claiming I loved the chainsaw more than it. So I sabotaged the chainsaw to make my love happy and prove my truthful love. I broke it apart and tossed it into the ground, cracking it open like a rotten's skull. Before the chainsaw was created, my love was satisfied by the rotten's flesh, which had been enough to sate my love's blood thirst. Then my love grew bitter and angry, demanding an extreme despite my protest and efforts. It wanted the warm flesh of the living.</em></strong></p><p><em>I hoped, as I offered my services as an escort, that it would satisfy my love to slay the one that caused it so much grief. But my love is greedy now, and I love it too much to deny its desires. So I ambushed him when he was unaware and trusting in me, cutting deep into his neck. There he lays now, stagnant and lifeless. Up the sandy slopes I tromp, towards the town, my blade in hand and shirt soaked in blood. I smile to hide my grief from my love as blood drops fall inside my footprints. I don't want to ruin our moment now, not when she was this happy. The slowly lowering sun silhouetted my form as my love glistens a bright cherry hue. My love shall be merry for the rest of my life, even if it kills me.</em></p><br><p><strong><em>Hours later, with most of the town slain, I am heading through wasteland to nowhere. My love echoes madly as I tiredly trudge on, screaming about needing more blood. Blood, blood, blood, blood! I finally grow too weary and jam its handle into the ground, blade up so it could hear me. I yell at it for its cruelty and curse at it for what I had lost for it. As I spill my feelings, it still calls for the spilling of blood. I try screaming louder, but its demands overpowered me. Giving up, I turn and try to flee from the noise, but my leg catches on a metal shard and twists inhumanly. I collapse beside my love and howl in agony. I cry and beg, asking my love to be merciful and silence itself. It continues on, ignoring my pleads completely as I lay at its side. I become angry and desperate to cease my pains.</em></strong><br> <br><em>"You want blood?!" I yell at it. "Take mine!"</em></p><p><em>With that, I push up with my arms to gain height with all my aching might and drop back to the ground a few inches from where the imprint of my impact was, landing with all my weight on my love. It jabs deep into my chest and I begin to choke each breath I breathe. It didn't stop, even as I offered my final gift, as I shifted myself onto my back. I taste blood deep in my throat as it seeps up to my lips. I feel about the wound with my numbing, already bloody hands. I feel upon my love's handle and the feeling of my own cold blood. I raise my hand to the sky, droplets of red falling like a rain of wine. One drop falls on my glabella and glazes over my vision. All I see is red and a blackness where my knife has dug into my flesh and bone. I lay back, staring at a dark, falling sun as it all fades away. My love silences just before I pass and blissful memories flash in my mind.<br>I smile.<br>I die tonight.</em></p>

                <p><strong>After a discussion with the whimsical donut <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/discrete.png" alt=":mush_chut:" class="tid_ico">, I must now post this edited version:</strong></p><br><p><em>Boots in the Dunes<br>by <strong>Sporeface Draink</strong></em></p><p>The warriors had offered to die. They had given their utmost charity to keep the loose town together. By the Sun's set, they would be dead, after all it only took the crazies five minutes to bite off one's fingers. The warriors were not cowards, not burdens to the residents. The armed stood front with daring spears at their hips... waiting for the moans.</p><p>Whether it was meant to be, Arnold knew there was no turning back. He held his wooden club behind the alignment of guards with spears. Arnold rustled his curly black hair, nervous about the upcoming event. He glanced at the glamorous sunset. Jubilant colors skyrocketing out and calling out for merciless death.</p><p>Among the warriors on steep hill, Arnold looked to his left to see a panting friend. The red-faced teenager was holding a splintered club like his in shaky hands. ‚ÄúYou okay, Scott?‚Äù Arnold admired his buddy. Arnold let out a drawn out sigh as he watched the valley below darken.</p><p>‚ÄúPeachy,‚Äù Scotty replied, patting his wooden club with unsure hands. Scott's ruffled blonde hair was overshadowed by a bandana he had strapped across his forehead. Scotty only came since Arnold volunteered for the duty. The two highschoolers were in it together, plus Scotty didn't want to be a wuss and wuss out.</p><p>The front row held out their spears. ‚ÄúSet!‚Äù A loud voice erupted from a spear-wielding punk. Santiago set his foot into the sands, ‚ÄúPosition!‚Äù He called out with a rough voice, gritting his teeth. Santiago turned and winked at Scotty and grinned. ‚ÄúHead up, Scotty boy.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúCan it, Santiago.‚Äù</p><p>'Hey, hey. No need to get mad, boy-o,‚Äù Santiago turned to eye Arnold with his rumpled up hair. ‚ÄúGet that club ready to bash in these sickos, alright?‚Äù Santiago jeered, snickering at Scotty again.</p><p>‚ÄúOh yeah, I'm more than ready,‚Äù Arnold joked, ‚Äúmaybe the sickos'll leave us once they see your buzzcut.‚Äù</p><p>Santiago dropped his grin into the sand dunes with his feet. A week ago, before the barber took to being dead, Santiago and his crew had went to get clean buzzcuts. Scotty quit his panting and chuckled as he looked up and looked at Santiago's buzzcut. He turned and saw Santiago's two friends, Jonsie and Todd, flaunting their funny looking hair.</p><p>‚ÄúYeah, yeah, okay,‚Äù Santiago shifted his feet and went to face the back. ‚ÄúI'll be back, Arny and Scotty.‚Äù Santagio blew through the sea of warriors with worthless clubs and past the sling-shooters who cowered when they saw Santiago's might. Where was he?</p><p>Santiago squinted, covering his eyes from the rising sand in the air. ‚ÄúWhere's Archie?‚Äù He asked a boy packing pellets into his pocket. The boy continued on, showing no interest in the punk that could rip him into halves. ‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù Santiago hissed.</p><p>The sling-shooter looked up, ‚ÄúOh it's you. I saw Archie loading the carts when we left.‚Äù</p><p>Santiago smiled grimly. ‚ÄúYou realize that was twenty minutes ago, correct?‚Äù</p><p>He nodded. ‚ÄúGet outta my face please, I have to separate my ammunition.‚Äù<br> Santiago scowled, cursing through his teeth. ‚ÄúDoes anyone know where Archie is?‚Äù No hands pipped or words uttered, only the clanging of weapons. Santiago shot a look at Arnold, trying to dig an answer out of him.</p><p>‚ÄúHey Santiago!‚Äù A dimwit bellowed, ‚ÄúArchie's that short stack, ya?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúYes, Todd. Have you seen him?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúYou betcha, I saw him like four days ago brushing his teeth.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI'ma pummel his face in when I see him!‚Äù Jonsie exclaimed, turning around with a fist in the air. ‚ÄúHe jacked my toothbrush!‚Äù</p><p>Santiago sighed. If they didn't get that payload here, they would have just wasted time. Would it better better to pull back and defend the gates? Oh how he wished to see that short stack-</p><p>‚ÄúComing through!‚Äù A voice yelled from behind two wooden carts nearing the warriors. ‚ÄúGo, go, go!‚Äù Archie shouted and pushed forward the energized carts. He smiled and clapped, wiping sweat from his face. ‚ÄúHey Santa!‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúIt's Santiago and where were you?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúOh boy, not this. The others told me to help them put a padlock on the gat-‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThey locked us out?!‚Äù Santiago screamed, stabbing his spear into the sand's vegetation. He closed in on a fear stricken Archie.</p><p>‚ÄúNegatory, well, kind of.‚Äù</p><p>The eyes of Santiago lit up, flustering with rage. ‚ÄúNo, no, no...‚Äù Santiago raked his hands through his greasy buzzcut. ‚ÄúWe're bait.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúNo way!‚Äù Before Archie could quiver in surprise, the sling-shooters jumped into the wooden carts and pushed forward with two people pushing on each cart. Santiago could only turn to see his warriors dive into a battle with no gain.</p><p>-</p><p>The roars of undead came first. Arnold rushed forward, slapping his club against a sicko's face. He heard an uttering crack, and let the sicko sway his arms in the air as he fell. Arnold caught his breath, a sandy one at that.</p><p>‚ÄúWait up, broski,‚Äù Scotty said, patting his friend on the back. ‚ÄúLet's go, I'm ready.‚Äù</p><p>Arnold blinked, rubbed his eyes, and scratched at his throat. He was parched and hadn't drank since the morning before. Now at midnight, his stomach grumbled. He was ablazed with a rush of exhausting energy.</p><p>The elongated spears kept the enraged crazies at bay for a while. It seemed to work out until three crazies took down a quarter of the group. Packs of undead swarmed the rest, with Todd trying to keep order. He must've asked himself where Santiago was. Where was he anyways? Todd would never know since he was overwhelmed by cold teeth that snapped fingers off in about five minutes.</p><p>‚ÄúHoly...‚Äù Scotty watched, losing grip of his club. ‚ÄúLet's do this, dude.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúNo, look.‚Äù Arnold pointed. His finger which could snapped off by cold teeth in about five minutes showed the way to the endless masses of dead overthrowing the warriors. It all went by fast, the sling-shooters desperately blasting indents into skulls, but not fast enough. ‚ÄúGame over, man, game over...‚Äù</p><p>-</p><p>The tiresome Santiago moved through the frosty desert winds. His spear went ahead of him with each step towards the town's front gates. His swift movement stood no chance against the force of the strong winds. Along with that, Santiago had begun worrying.</p><p>He had told the nerd to alert the army about the betrayal and to gather up when they could. Santiago hoped they would come in one piece. He hadn't had time to warn them himself. He had to get to the town before they were swarmed.</p><p>‚ÄúAlmost there...‚Äù</p><p>Santiago soon saw the glint of torches that centered the fort. He passed over a mossy, wet pile of logs and a heap of scrap cans. Santiago could use some spam. Maybe a sandwich? Don't get ahead of yourself, he thought.</p><p>‚ÄúCome on, come on...‚Äù The angered punk charged through the shearing wind, only making a few feet's worth of progress. ‚ÄúDamn you!‚Äù He shouted at the gates. ‚ÄúDamn you if you can hear me!‚Äù He couldn't make it, but he was so close. He and the others weren't going to die for the scum they were protecting.</p><p>Through the gleaming light, he grabbed the metal gate. He pounded his fists to it, hearing it rebound and echo out. Thus, echoing out to the creepy shadows shambling towards him. Those weren't his boys, they were sickos.</p><p>‚ÄúDon't you do this,‚Äù He pounded his knuckles harder ad harder. ‚ÄúYou just don't do this!‚Äù He kicked and took a step back before gutting the padlock with effortless ease, letting it drop into the sands like his feet.</p><p>He shoved through the gates with a thrust of frustration. He shut the gates behind him, letting it rebound and echo to the closing in sickos. Santiago aimed his spear at what he saw first. Eyes watching him from their tents.</p><p>‚ÄúStop!‚Äù A grumpy man with a full grown beard edged through his hovel, a dwelling composed of a bent wooden plank and some rusty nails. ‚ÄúStand back, you.‚Äù</p><p>Santiago held his spear tighter. Without a doubt, the tip was damaged permanently. ‚ÄúYou know my name, Albert.‚Äù<br> ‚ÄúGo back, now. I mean it.‚Äù<br> <br> Santiago took the hit. ‚ÄúFor what, huh, just so you can lock me out again with my boys dying back there?‚Äù He craned his neck towards the tiny crowd gathering, looking for answers.</p><p>A skinny water boy held up his hand, ‚ÄúWe voted. Take some water if you want.‚Äù He tossed it, the water showering Santiago's feet in the sand. The precious water was as good as gold, and the skinny water boy had just done so to waste it.</p><p>‚ÄúYou say something, kid?‚Äù Santiago scoffed, raising his spear. A gasp spread through the residents Santiago had tried to be their savior. Instead, now they were shocked at him. ‚ÄúYou shit!‚Äù He grunted as he leveled the spear above him. ‚ÄúAh!‚Äù</p><p>Before he could react, a fist struck his nose and sent a chilling crack through the air. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He muttered, soon feeling a burst of pain in his gut as a multitude of punches met him. Santiago faltered back after someone with a miniature knife went into his shoulder.</p><p>An ungodly scream left Santiago's throat as he tried to regain his balance with his boots in the sand, but ultimately collapsed to the floor with a sorrowful cry. He landed outside into the cold, barren, dark wasteland outside. The only light had marked the shadows of the dead getting closer and closer.</p><p>The poor punk looked up from the entanglement of vegetation as Albert went to seal the gates once and for all. ‚ÄúYou son of a...‚Äù Santiago tried to keep the gates open with a hand, but felt his bones ache and send him down. Through the darkness, only the shutting of the gate's echoed, followed by ghostly, rising moans.</p>

                <p><strong>The Recurring Nightmare</strong></p><p>I was sleeping in my cozy tent last night when i had a dream, it was simple dream about me strolling in the dessert. I was scavenging for food and i walk to the south out of my town when i realized i was being stalked by something, it wasn't zombie, nor ghouls, i dismissed it as a mirage. You know when you're out in the dessert for so long you become hallucinative and start imagining things it happens all the time, but this isn't an imagination.</p><p>I was still scavenging when i look back at the thing, he was there, he was always there. He wore an old dusty white jacket with a hood that was covering half of his face i can only see his mouth from the distance it stretches from ear to ear, his teeth is jagged almost spiky and its coated in what looks like fresh blood that drips from his mouth into his jacket. I was unnerved, no one wears jacket like that not in this blazing hell and his presence concerns me like he was always watching my every move. I keep moving south i don't even care about scavenging anymore i just want to keep myself as far as i can from that thing.</p><p>i arrived in new part of dessert i looked back and there he was, standing even closer than before he smiled at me and stretches his arm it looks like a pole, long and slender with five long razor sharp finger dripping with blood. There's still something stuck in it, it looks like intestine of god knows what. Before i knew it he started to charge towards me mouth opening wider than anything i have ever seen before, now i can see the full extent of his knife like teeth still with some leftover meat clinging to it, how can that teeth fit in his mouth? i wonder. He runs very fast and jumps really high, all while he was shrieking like a banshee, i started to run like hell, the dessert seems endless but at the corner of my eyes i caught something that looks like citizens house maybe i can hide there.</p><p>As i reached the citizens house the dream abruptly ended, i woke up in my tent covered in sweat and breathing heavily, i don't think much about it. Nightmare is common nowadays every now and then you hear people screaming from their tent, sometimes nightmare sometimes they're being munched to death by zeds, but it occasionaly happens around here. I go to sleep the next day just before the attack the watchmen are professional so i think i'm safe enough from the zeds, although nobody warns me about the danger i will face in my dreams.</p><p>I dreamed of the exact same thing, today i barely outrun him to the citizens house before the dream ends again. I cannot sleep for the coming days i decided to keep myself awake by joining the ranks of watchmen. It was sucessful for a few days i'm awake and i stayed away from sleeping for a day or two. But at the third day i just lost it i fell asleep and the other watchmen have to carry me into my tent. Before i knew it there i was again in the middle of the dessert.</p><p>My days in the watchmen duty may have lifted my confidence a bit, killing some zombies may just have been the right exercise to kill whatever that unholy creature is, i have never been so wrong no zombies can ever prepare me to meet the horror from this thing. I'm prepared, i picked up a hurling stick that was laying around, for the first time ever i will make my stance if i die here then that's my fate and i'm ready to face him i'd rather die in peace than to face shit over and over again.</p><p>There he was smiling with his bloody teeth i see the terror in his face and i'm starting to lost my composure but i hold up, i regret my decision to stay and fight but it was too late. He came straight at me, i swung my stick all over the place in hope of hitting him, i don't care anymore i just want him dead. Suddenly i hit something it was his head it was bashed in i hit him a couple more time while cussing at him, you can never be too sure you know. Then i left his body there and walk away feeling like a champion, suddenly i realized there was a huge oozing wound on my right hand the damn thing bit me, and in my vigorous strike i didn't even know it, it was bleeding really badly and the wound shaped like a bite mark, i kept walking holding my wound it hurts so bad, then i look back at where the body supposed to be, it was gone, what's left is just a big puddle of blood from the thing and my own blood.</p><p>i was walking around for what feels like a lifetime when i saw a building, likely a citizens house my vision is blurry and i have a nasty nausea i was waiting to die at that moment because i have lost too much blood. Then i walk to the ruined house, what a pleasant place to die at the very least i didn't die in the middle of a dessert. my wounds is just too great of a pain to bare and i passed out. Then i woke up in sweat and i realized that it was all just a dream and there is no monster like that in this world at least, and then just like that you looked at your right hand <strong>it was a bite mark with a fresh blood, still dripping from it</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Curiosity </strong></p><br><p>No one had given the slightest thought that day to what was beyond our prosperous defenses. No one had a clue what was on the horizon. It was a solemn day with the residents laying back on their soiled cots. Cheering. Singing. Not giving a rat's ass to what would come.</p><p>Until Clyde rushed into the gates looking like he had climbed the tallest point in the desert wastes. Whoever in our city heard his shouts of terror came to the front of our great fortifications. I was checking stock at our bank, passing out soggy bags with soggy food rations. On a solemn day.</p><p>‚ÄúWhat's he going off about?‚Äù I concentrated my eyes on a weathered, restless man. Danny was his name. He turned to me and shrugged his shoulders and took his soggy bag with soggy food rations. No curiosity marked his buggery eyes.</p><p>‚ÄúIt's the desert,‚Äù said a woman, Carolyn, from the dusty shelves that held some punctured cans of beans. ‚ÄúTold 'im to not go wandering off for the night.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúHe stayed outside for the night?‚Äù At the moment it seemed I was the only living soul in town who wanted to know why Clyde was wailing and shoving people away from him when he staggered into the town.</p><p>Carolyn nodded and adjusted her hair bun. She rubbed her bloodshot eyes, looking like she had been crying for days. ‚ÄúHe and his friend,‚Äù she paused, ‚Äúthe skinny one.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúSnyder?‚Äù Of course it was Snyder. He was the lively hippie with the guitar Clyde had salvaged parts for the week before. Was it a week? Probably, since that was the day Carolyn's sister was overwhelmed by the snarling monsters that came from the darkness. ‚ÄúIs he out there with Clyde?‚Äù</p><p>I think everyone could have used one of Snyder's cheerful Les Paul tunes today. Within our great walls of protecting metal plates. ‚ÄúHe's dead.‚Äù My eyes went to Danny. Curiosity crossed his face. ‚ÄúI just went out there. He keeps shouting 'they got'em! They got my friend!'‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I asked.</p><p>‚ÄúDid I stutter?‚Äù Whatever curiosity he had had vanished like remains of Carolyn's sister when the monsters hobbled off into their Darkness.</p><p>I had this tingling sensation that made me leave my post. I found myself strolling past Danny and through his retreating lust for what was soon to come. Then past Carolyn, who had taken to herself. Wiping at her eyes. ‚ÄúHey-‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúYou can take it.‚Äù I blurted out. The next moment, I was outside with the blonde sand particles biting at my face. There was Clyde, huddled on the floor in fetal position. ‚ÄúIs he okay?‚Äù</p><p>Clyde let out a long, horrendous yelp. ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù said one of the watchmen. ‚ÄúWe keep trying to stand him up, but it seems his legs are crippled.‚Äù</p><br><p>Clyde was rolling in the masses of sand. His brown, torn shirt went with him and was, by the time I saw him, covered in sand. He was muttering to himself, keeping a hand cupped on his left ear. Something about Carolyn's sister.</p><p>‚ÄúDid you try getting that hand o-‚Äù Before I could finish, Clyde shot up and lunged at the group of irritated watchmen. Curiosity left me. Common sense slapped me across the face.</p><p>‚ÄúI'm sorry!‚Äù Clyde shouted as he landed on an unfortunate member of the brave watchmen. The ones who were supposed to keep the city secure. ‚ÄúS-snyder‚Äù And then a shining dagger escaped from the depths of Clyde's dirty trousers and into the watchman's chest.</p><p>I had watched the watchmen get butchered before my eyes. Ironic. As the residents leaped up from their cots or zipped up their tents, I froze there. Froze staring at Clyde's left ear. Where it should have been. The monsters wouldn't do that and leave him alive. Something with a mind did that. On purpose.</p><p>Before I could utter the word, Clyde himself rose from the watchman's dying body and slid out the dagger. His eyes were terrified and made to petrify me as I stood motionless. ‚ÄúClyde,‚Äù I stopped to dodge his blade and land on the prosperous walls that had defended us from the monsters. And the Ghouls.</p><p>The realization hit me as soon as the cold blade met my throat. I had gulped, dragging my eyes to Clyde's terrified eyes. Eyes that had seen his best friend mauled by a pathetic ghoul. The same ones who had seen Carolyn's body hauled away by the ghoul.</p><p>The one's who had stared down at the ghoul right before he was slain with his own dagger.</p><p>At that pristine moment, I found out that there was no need to struggle. All Clyde had to do was move the blade a little centimeter to cut his jugular. No, Clyde wouldn't want that. He stood there and fixated upon the dagger he held so firmly. ‚ÄúSnyder...‚Äù</p><p>Before I could blink, Clyde tore the shining blade through the air. I was expecting a quick death. I didn't open my eyes when the blade swooshed through the air. Not when Carolyn stood herself petrified like stone behind me at the bank's window panel.</p><p>Instead, I merely cranked an eye open. Right on time to see the life drain from the traumatized eyes of Clyde Morrison. The brother of Snyder Morrison. The last of the Morrison's gasped for air as he held the dagger to his own hiccuping chest.</p><p>When Clyde sucked in his last breath of sandy air and came to a rest on his side, I thought of doing the same. The two of us laid back with me huffing and puffing. The sand was cool, not burning hot like I had predicted it would be.</p><p>A fine day for some Les Paul tunes.</p>

                <p><strong>The Humor of the Crows</strong><br>OH GOD!<br>Please let me rest! Not again, I just want...<br>I want the rest. <br><span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span> betrayed me! He butchered me for a bone. <br>FOR A BONE!!! <br>It barely hurt to be honest, a sharp blade isn't the worst way to die. But rebirth.<br>Rebirth is where the pain becomes real. <br>Time means nothing, nothing means anything during your limbo until your next stretch of life. When the hot air fills your lungs with fire and your heart spasms blood to carry that fire to your brain so that it may spark forth and become a vessel for your soul if for only a few days.<br>The pain hasn't begun yet. Why has the eternity of sorrow begun yet? Why can I watch <span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span> carry my bone back to town?<br>Why is <span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span> carrying me back to town?<br>Why do i care? The pain is postponed at least. Perhaps even eliminated. <br>Oh but if the crows were so kind. So forgiving. <br>"We learn from the searing agony don't we my old friend?" That voice, no more of a whisper. "Your death will save many tonight, try to focus on that through your suffering. Do try"</p><p>The Shaman. <span class="tid_user tid_user_28959 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="28959">fullbandit</span> has brought back all that remains of me to the Shaman. <br>The night is invisible to me now, but I can feel the anticipation and fear of my old companions now and i know the sun has set. <br>Shapes and colors aren't clear to me anymore all that I perceive is emotions and thoughts. Until a glowing face is all that I experience.</p><p>The shamans horrible mask! It consumes all that I know and hums an alien hymn. The mouth moves as freely as any living man and all that i knew of the pain of life and death are forgotten and the indescribable torment of rebirth becomes all that i wish for. <br>The mask breaths and I can feel my essence being sucked forward. like a wind that pulls your hair from your skin then your skin from your bones. <br>"EEEEEHHHHHH YYYYYYYEAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!" I scream like steam coming from a whistle. And with one last inhale, I fill him. Now inside his body he has complete control over all that I am and he slowly chants in an ancient language too terrifying to focus on. I experience the impossible. <br>My bones being tore from my skin. <br>From inside my skin. <br>Then the Shaman holds his breath and i feel everything dissected, what was once one is now 100 thousand. and i can feel all 100 thousand of my pain. Slowly, so horribly slowly he breaths me out in pieces as all 100 thousand of me raise to the air and form clouds. <br>Most of me feels nothing any longer but senses the dozens of hopeful living in the town below. And just as all of me is at peace. Real peace. It ends.<br>Simply ends. <br>Rebirth begins and it hurts the way it always does. But I know now that being put back together is nothing compared to being torn apart.</p>
