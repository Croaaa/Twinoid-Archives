                <p>Hi all <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"><br>I am a new player that just started in my second city.<br>Basically the reason for this thread was i noticed the deleted posts and messages from the crows on the forums and found myself wondering.... why?</p><p>This game seems like alot of fun and one of the main things that I found appealing was the mature content and nature of the game itself, its nice to find a game that doesnt go all disney just to try and shift the maximum number of units.</p><p>I'm not a troll or a former player with an axe to grind I just found it off putting when i was going through the forums and found stuff like peoples posts deleted and replaced with a message from a moderator that they werent allowed to use that kind of language...</p><p>Really? in a game with content like "Big Rubber Dick's", drug use and flesh eating zombies are we seriously proscribed from swearing? lol</p><p>Anybody that has used the internet for more then 15 minutes learns not to feed the trolls and to just ignore personal attacks from people who are douches so im not really sure why the forums need "moderators" or silly rules</p><p>I would like to ask the moderators themselves to comment on how they think they fit into the picture and why a moderated forum is better then allowing the citizens to govern themselves like they do in the game and i would also love to hear what the die2nite community has to say on the issues of free speech, censorship, political correctness and being watched over by "big brother"</p><p>unless my thread gets locked/deleted... lol</p>

                <p><span class="tid_announce">"Free speech" generally applies to the right to criticize your government with impunity. It does not apply to private enterprises like websites, who usually have a set of guidelines they wish their members to follow. When you sign up on a site, you agree to follow this set of guidelines and if you don't, your messages could be deleted or you could be banned along with other actions, like you could get your liver pecked and a stern talking to. Welcome to Interneting 101. <br><br>As for what gets moderated here on the Town Forums, generally bigoted (racist, sexist, homophobic) comments are deleted and a warning given. It is common sense in a community or society where you strive for an environment in which you want to communicate with some semblance of success, that you don't tolerate hateful communications. "Big Rubber Dick" and a homophobic or similarly hateful comment are not the same thing.<br><br>The moderators follow the guidelines set out here by the company we work for, Motion Twin. If you would rather people ignore personal attacks and other disruptiveness, take it directly to Motion Twin. As for now, this is the system we play and work with.<br><a href="http://www.die2nite.com/#help/i_m_annoyed" target="_blank">http://www.die2nite.com/#help/i_m_ann...</a><br></span></p>
