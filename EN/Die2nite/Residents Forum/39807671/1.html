Infos in form of Forum Threads</em> (Part 1)</strong><br>(the full Text was too long to fit in one post)<br>these informations can be posted in the forum in specific days during your organized towns so the team can read and understand what the whole team is trying to do:<ul><li><strong>Day 1 Diamond scavenging:</strong><br>to all new players unfamiliar with this small but very useful Strategy:<br>everyone except 1 or 2 builders and 2 Rescuers must take their daily 6 AP food and water and go to a zone exactly 9 AP from town and autosearch there all day long and once it gets depleted you work your way back inside. <br>if you get trapped and you need help just create a thread in the forum and others will come to you and help you.<br>make sure you do not go to a zone already picked by someone else to maximize the search BUT if someone gets trapped and needs help then its 100% ok to scavenge in a group of 2 or 3 after the Rescue has been done.<br>by the end of the day the map should look like this:<br><a target="_blank" href="http://gyazo.com/6571f881c8a7a63c61308dda902233ca">Day 1 Diamond </a><br><strong><em>make sure to turn full escort on at all times so scavengers or the 2 Rescuers who will stay inside on day 1 can come and escort you back if for any reason you wont be able to get online to come back on your own before the attack</em></strong><br>_________________________________</li><li><strong>Priority Items to bring back on Day 1, 2 &amp; 3:</strong><br>this list is extremly important and all items listed below must not be left outside because the entire plan for day 2, 3 &amp; 4 depends on these items. <br>first do not under any circumstances use <strong>Alcohol, Twinoids, Steroids or 7 AP food</strong> , bring them back with you because you will need them all for at least 12 to 14 missions on day 2 so every single booster will count.<br>Priority Items to bring back on Day 1 for Day 2 scout´s and Survivalist´s Expditions:<ul><li><strong>Incomplete shopping Trolley, Manbag, Ultra Rucksack</strong></li><li><strong>Semtex, Detonator, Duct Tape, plastic bags</strong> (for Exploding Water Bombs)</li><li><strong>Radius Mark II, Raduis Radar Beacon</strong></li><li><strong>Kwik-fix, Broken electric Device</strong></li><li><strong>FatCat, Hurling stick, serrated knife, Box Cutter</strong></li><li><strong>Furious Kitten (do not use it outside at all, survivalists will need them for far away expeditions)</strong></li><li><strong>Bandages or Chests if you can´t open them in the desert</strong></li><li><strong>Box Cutter</strong> use it with <strong>Fat Serpant</strong> in the desert if possible to get a <strong>Furious Kitten</strong></li><li><strong>Flash Powder</strong> only 4 are needed for 4 x Flash Granade</li><li><strong>Water Purifying Tablets + Jerrycans</strong></li><li><strong>All kinds of powerful weapons you can build:</strong> mower, machete, chainsaw, Puta mk2, devastator.</li><li><strong>1 Broken Staff, 1 Waire Reel &amp; 1 Empty Oil can</strong> only one of each nothing more is needed first 4 days.</li><li><strong>1 Novelty Torch, 1 Laser Diode, 1 wire Reel</strong> for building a laser pointer<br>of course this list will change around Day 4 to 5+<br>__________________________________</li></ul></li><li><strong>Updating Zed Numbers before killing to help with Zoo making</strong>:<br>Everyone who will go on a clearing mission anywhere on the map especialy outside 9 AP Range: <br>you should Update the number of zeds you find in each zone you clear in the "scout sense" option in DTD, <br>this will help the planners predict the zombie spread next day for zoo making and also help calculate the number of zeds who will die from greif (Attrition) which is extremly helpful because zeds first spread then die from grief. <br>check this simple explainaltion: <a target="_blank" href="http://gyazo.com/648a8a24ef775a2b9b7f0bdf6b76fc80">here</a><br>__________________________________</li></ul></li></ul><p><br><br><strong><em>If you have questions feel free to post or ask anything in here as long you remain "ON TOPIC" please </em></strong></p>

                <p>...</p><ul><li><strong><em>3 - Explained Strategies &amp; Infos in form of Forum Threads</em> (Part 2)</strong> <br>(the full Text was too long to fit in one post)<ul><li><strong>Holding specific BPs Strategies:</strong><br>first of all Common BPs <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_plan.gif" alt=":hordes_plan:" class="tid_ico"> are the only type of BPs which must be opened immediately after bringing them home.<br>now about other types of BPs:<br>this is one of the most important Strategy for a successful Town. so you have to make sure it gets done correctly:<br>you must hold all BPs you find from Camping , in Worn Leather Bag, Architect´s Chest or Sealed Architect´s Chest , (short WLB, AC and SAC) untill you will find the Explorable Ruin, search it, deplete it and open Most BPs you find inside it. (here not all explorable Ruin BPs should be opened immediately, there are special cases mentioned below)<br>now you do this because the BPs from the Explorable Ruin can be Duplicates to the already opened BPs from Camping, WLB, AC or SAC and therefore they will be useless by not unlocking any projects and cost you one less project if you open them after opening the BPs you find from camping , WLB, AC or SAC.<br>the normal BPs (from Camping, WLB, AC or SAC) on the other hand can not be duplicate for other BPs and will always unlock a new Projct in the Construction Site till you unlock them all along with all "Parent Projects" which have "Child Projects". and that is why you should hold the Normal BPs in the bank and never open them till you open most BPs from the Explorable Ruin. <br>now to the 2 special cases:<ul><li>1 - if you wont unlock Vegi Plot (common BP) early which is the "Parent Project" for both "child Projects" <strong>Ferilizers</strong> (rare BP) and <strong>Grapeboom</strong> (uncommon BP) then you should hold about 2 normal rare BPs and 2 uncommon for as long as needed till you unlock Vegi Plot and then open those 4 BPs because you can not unluck any Child Project if you didn´t unlock their Parent Project first.</li><li>2 - depending on the type of explorable ruin you will find on the map you may also need to hold uncommon BPs from ruins after you get all from its pool unlocked except the child projects under the "parent project" <strong>Guard Tower</strong> (Uncommon BP). <br>i will give a small example in here: if you have a Hotel Explorable Ruin then the list of all Uncommon BPs you can get from it are:<br>Animal Dump , Food Dump , Frat House , Wood Dump , Metal Dump , Guerilla Traps , Swedish Workshop. <br>now the first 6 Projects are all not child projects of Guardtower, so once you find the first 6 uncommon BPs from the explorable ruin and open them all you will 100% unlock those 6 projects. BUT the last 7th project (Swedish Workshop) is a "child Project" of the "Parent Project "GuardTower" (also Uncommon BP) . so when you reach this point after unlocking the first 6 uncommon BPs from the explorable ruin and then find a 7th uncommon BP from the ruin you have to first HOLD this 7th uncommon BP from the explorable ruin and open all normal uncommon BPs you have from "Camping and Worn Leather Bags" till you unlock "Guard Tower" and only after that the 7th uncommon BP from the ruin you have been holding will unlock the "Swedish Workshop".<br>of course the same should be done with all 3 types of Explorable ruins and you can find a full list of which projects you can/will get from each ruin in here: <a target="_blank" href="http://die2nitewiki.com/wiki/Explorable_Ruins">Explorable Ruins BP List</a></li><li>there is one last special case for Small cemetary (common BP) being a parent project for the child project "Coffin Catapult" which is a (very rare BP) but there is no smart way to deal with it because it involves Holding common BPs to avoid unlocking Small cemetary to avoid discovering Coffin Catapult and instead get a useful Very rare BP like Builder´s Marchant... if your town did manage to unlock "Vegi Plot" along with "central cafeteria" as early as possible then you could hold all common BPs till you have opened all very rare BPs from the explorable ruin and normal BPs. <br>__________________________________</li></ul></li><li><strong>Day 2 Scout Missions:</strong><br>one of the planners in each town (anyone who can draw a route using MSpaint or Photoshop can make them)<br>you can watch the video about the Guide of how to make a Zoo to know how the scout routes should look like and which direction should be scouted first which will serve making the zoo best. <br>In most towns there should be one full time Hero scout and 2 to 3 more BiA Resident Scouts who should do 3 to 4 scouting routes on day 2 to locate buildings for the Survivalists.<br><strong>All 4 Scouts &amp; BiA resident Scouts:</strong> <br>each one of you will take a flash granade for in case you will lose your camouflage in one of the buildings you will run into. <br>Please do the complete route ASAP after arrgh because 3 Survivalists teams of 6 Survivalists will be waiting for the result of your scouting to know where to go to camp.<br>All scouts will be using water, 7 AP food , a Drug (twinoid or steroid) and alcohol and should complete their Full routes immediately after arrgh even if that means they will have to Autosearch with Drunk Status all day long in last zone inside Heroic Return Range.<br>also if the town has Radius Radar Beacons then all scouts should take a manbag or a trolley to be able to carry the radius and use it when they sense a building they can´t walk into or simply use it at the farthest zone they will reach to make the Survivalist Expoeditions easier.<br>try to talk in chat with others while you are doing your route in case changing route is needed after you run out of flash granades and further scouting becomes risky for getting you trapped in a building.<br>___________________________________</li><li><strong>Survivalists Plans (Day 2 to 5)</strong><br>each Organized town should have between 7 and 9 survivalists.<br>here is the main plan which has 3 goals:<ul><li>open the entire map to find all 5 Architect Chests + 2 Sealed Architect Chests.</li><li>camp all 20 buildings but first give priority to only those in 10 km range or farther at first to get all rare BPs first which can be game changing if opened early shortly after the explorable ruin gets depleted.</li><li>make the Zoo (if your team chooses to try to make one) by clearing all the zed in the entire map except one Corner which will be decided later on day 4 when the watchtower lvl 3 vote uncover the entire 10 km range. (but as always each map has its location and circumstances)</li></ul></li><li>now here is a detailed Guide of what this class is supposed to do to accomplish all these 3 Goals:<ul><li>each team of 2 Survivalist must wait for the 3 to 4 Scout routes and once they are finished 3 Survivalists teams can take all the Supplies they need to walk to their assigned campsites and camp them along with some zed clearing if weapons and enough ammo is available.</li><li>only 3 teams of 2 survs in each team will/should go camp on day 2 and the last team will keep scavenging inside the Diamond as usual and wait till a decent weapon, like mower, machete , Laser Pointer or MK2 will show up and be found. once you will find one of those weapons the 4th survivalists team or just one signle survivalist will go help one of the 3 Survivalists teams which needs help the most.</li><li>each team of 2 partners will take:<ul><li>trolley or the extra manbags if you have enough (after the scouts take the needed manbags) (here try to sort the selfish play instinct by beginners to learn to never hold containors and always Share them)</li><li>pretty much all the weapons you have in the bank, each team should have one <strong>loaded Water Pistol, 1 EWB (Exploding Water Bomb) and back up water to use for ammo. then fill the few empty spots left with other weapons like Fatcats, hurling sticks, serrated knifes</strong></li><li>if you manage to find bandages one team should take one bandage + as many furious kittens available and can be carried.</li><li>and last of course take your food (6 AP food unless you need that extra AP for clearing debris) and if your trip to first campsite is far or headed to a DEEP buried building take one drug and one alcohol.</li></ul></li><li>this may seem like alot to carry but i am listing those items in general and 2 partners will be able to carry 12 to 14 items easily...</li><li>when you head to campsite both survs in each team must make sure to walk diffrent but parallel routes next to each other to open new unvisited zones on their way to campsite and help each other if someone gets trapped and run out of ammo or run into an unexpected building.</li><li>few hours before arrgh after one of the 2 survs in each team can make sure optimal camping chance is garanteed then him/her or the partner MUST try to clear all zeds around the campsite with the rest of ammo still available if any is left. (here be smart and dont get greedy with breakable weapons But still don´t skip the clearing if you still have ammo left and 3 camera flashes)</li><li>next day all surv teams will get supply drops from town at specific zones and give BPs + goodies they found to the dropper and then carry on doing the same till the entire map is explored, all 7 architect chests are found and the zoo is made. <br>_________________________________</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

But in general you must keep scavenging with the highest numbers you can afford. <strong>and here keep in mind that you should never start rationing water and keep drinking daily for all scavengers and builders and to do so you have to build all water projects you have unlocked or if badly needed vote few Pump Votes.</strong> same with eating food daily , try to build Apple Tree, Hennhouse and Vegi Plot + Fertilizers and once you do that you will be able to let everyone eat everyday no matter what. <br>_________________________________</li></ul></li><li><strong>Priority items Lists over 3 Phases in each town </strong> a copy/paste text that can be copied and edited:<br><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/158Kr0FaA9lY5LytDYlG5vgXsFJE6KA9-fYsIaNGQ65s/edit">Priority Item´s lists </a> <br>_________________________________</li><li><strong>Priority item´s from Day 4 or 5+:</strong><br>always come back with a heavy item.

And then let everyone else go camp in most of the 20 campsites the map has.</li><li>the next day after few people will die inside (between 3 to 6 could die inside) you must send certain campers back inside to have 10 inside again and you should keep doing that for as many days as long the shaman has good chances surviving inside (there is an external "Attack calculator" for that in the Game Directory) and having 95% to 100% chances are good enough for the shaman inside)</li><li>Now keep in mind this plan is done for 2 main reasons:<ul><li>to keep the town from devastation by leaving citizens inside for as long as possible (3 to 6 days) and</li><li>to keep the main shaman alive and without camping penalties for as long as possible so he/she can collect all rest of souls after all die to boost your ranking points of 10 extra bonus points per Soul.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><br><br>waiting for someone to post so i can post last part (multi post lock got activated) <img src="../../../../gfx/square/mad.png" alt="X[" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>thanks Miudo <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":sq_smile:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>...</p><ul><li><strong>End Game:</strong> (Part 2)</li><li><strong>About classes</strong>:<ul><li><strong>Tamers:</strong> are the best classes to collect souls so those should camp in 4 diffrent locations to collect as many souls as possible before they die.</li><li><strong>Guardians:</strong> have extra 1 home defence in town so they should stay inside (not a must but prefered).</li><li><strong>Survivalists:</strong> all should have camped 3 to 5 times so they wont have more than 3 to 4 days camping with optimal chances to survive 100% (mainly depends on having Pro-camper unlocked). so it is best for Survs to camp for as long as they get Optimal chances then get back inside when needed to fill out the 10 inside spots or just keep camping till they die if the town gets devastated before they were needed inside.</li><li><strong>Residents:</strong> those who have been BiAed as Scouts/tamers will be needed to camp outside to collect souls if you will still have enough Heroes to BiA a hero day. all other Residents also should camp first because they can not upgrade their homes with Fences, Reinforcments and more storage unless they get a BiA hero day but when the time comes for filling the 10 spots inside they should return back home regardless.</li><li><strong>Scouts:</strong> the one full time scout must camp in the nearest campsite to the ZOO if one has been built , otherwise if there is not zoo then its best to let the scout camp in the nuclear bunker one of the best campsites in the map to garantee getting souls from zones heavily infested with zeds.</li><li><strong>Back Up Shaman:</strong> each Town should have a main shaman who will stay inside during End game and the back up shaman will go camp outside for as long as possible to have a back up Plan in case very bad Luck happens and the main shaman inside dies from unlucky RNG . if all goes to plan the back Up shaman should keep camping till the time comes for him/her to suicide so the main shaman can collect his/her soul which should be the 39th soul.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>About Home Defence</strong>:<ul><li>all 10 inside must take all DOs from the bank and put them in their chests BUT only after the shaman gets as many DOs as he/she can fit in his/her chest. so whenever the shaman gets more storage upgraded one of those inside must send him/her a DO.<br>keep in mind it is not important for ranking if other classes survive one or 2 more days but it will be a disaster if the shaman dies and you don´t collect all remaining souls.</li><li>All 10 inside must build reinforcment lvl 1 and install a fence for 4 home points using (chain + metal Support)</li><li>All Makeshift Barricades, Iron Chests, BOxes and rest of Wire Mesh not used in Constructions Must be collected from the desert wherever they are and only the main shaman must use them all to get the highest home defence which can be between 75 and 105 depending on how well the town worked for this Goal.</li><li>in the first 20 to 25 days before End game starts you all should have brought back at least 140 to 160 DOs to the bank which all will be used by all the 10 inside in their chests for extra home defence. this is a task you should train for while going to scavenge everyday by planning to return with one heavy object daily. any town which will have less than 140 DOs in the bank by the time the End Game will start should be considered failing on this task and didn´t do well gathering DOs. it wont be a disaster but it is bad not being able to get that many so try very hard to remind everyone to bring all DOs available outside.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>About Recycling Houses</strong><br>after few deaths in town you must pillage the DOs from one house of the dead with the least number of DOs in them and then the few survivors inside must recycle houses with the biggest number of DOs to get those back to the bank and use them again to fill more storage. here you must know that each home can be recycled using 15 AP. so dividing this task among 3 people inside should be easy and wise and do not forget guitar AP which may get wasted at this stage if not used early.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>For those who will get back to fill the 10 inside:</strong><br>you will most likely have to bring back a soul with you on your way returning back home and once you are in town you can use the rest of your AP to make any possible home upgrades you can do and then fill your chest with as many DOs as possible.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>When to abandon the town?</strong><br>once the survivor´s numbers is down to 12 to 14 OR the shaman can no longer get higher than 95% survival chances inside because the lack of home defence then it will be time to abandon the town and all can go camp. of course there is a risk involved from this point on that both shamans could die from camping with decent 90% chances , so here its going to be a decision made of willing to risk it and camp one or 2 more nights counting on the survival of the main shaman with 90% chances or start suiciding in town to allow the shaman to collect the few souls left. <br><strong>here keep in mind all campers who will die before the town will be devastated will not give the town a point of the last day they camped and died in , which means those dying before the devastation of the town will be points lost for ranking</strong>. <br>this means for teams who would like to play things safe they can leave like 5 people inside in the day of leaving the town who will still give a ranking point for the last day they lived and also leave 5 souls to collect by the shaman for 50 ranking points. <br>also remember tamers and shaman should be the last to suicide to give souls because those 2 classes are the best for soul collecting , shaman can carry several souls in one rucksack and tamers can send one soul back to town with their Dogs and whoever is in town at that point can cash them in.<br>_________________________________</li><li><strong><em>If you have questions feel free to post or ask anything in here as long you remain "ON TOPIC" please</em></strong> <br>and again i must remind : this is for one out of many ways to play organized and i left out fairly small part of missing informations and strategies, because in my personal opinion they are very hard to explain or get accomplished if all this is new to you, so they will confuse more than help.</li></ul>

                <p>I haven't read the whole thing yet, so I might still have some questions later, but for now I want to ask, are you sure that survival rate on Watch is 90/95% (non-guardian/guardian) rather than 95%/100%? Also, on the camping chances calculator, Buried Building has its own topology reference but it is also an adjustable Y/N parameter. What's up with that? Finally, you might want to adjust the multi-night camping explanation tab comments on Hardcore a bit, as it's still saying that Hardcore imposes a 10 upgrade penalty rather than the actual 14 upgrade penalty that was presumably discovered later. No one reads those sections though, so you can probably just leave it.</p>

Also, on the camping chances calculator, Buried Building has its own topology reference but it is also an adjustable Y/N parameter. What's up with that? Finally, you might want to adjust the multi-night camping explanation tab comments on Hardcore a bit, as it's still saying that Hardcore imposes a 10 upgrade penalty rather than the actual 14 upgrade penalty that was presumably discovered later. No one reads those sections though, so you can probably just leave it.</cite><p>Guardian is back to 100% again. Others have a base of 95%.</p><p>Buried building has a topology rating of 5, and you gain camping bonus on buried building which is 15% (or 3 upgrades worth). The adjustable Y/N is for the camping bonus on buried building. Camping bonus affects you but not the zone itself.</p><p>Yes hardcore penalty is -70% (or -14 upgrades worth).

Things are supposed to calm down in the next couple of weeks, but that just gives enough time for another something to creep up. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>As for instructions, noticed a few people add some notes onto the sheet since it went live to help with some clarifications I didn't realize might be needed at the time, so nothing against anyone adding any extra notations, like on DO installation order, that might be helpful. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":sq_smile:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Also I tried to clean up the user interface a little. I found the other calculator to be a bit clunky, I like a top down approach opposed to their straight across approach, so, yeah, this design is more for how I input and calculate the camping chances for my own one man camping trip than it is for mass town hysteria, but without any feedback it's hard to know what might make things easier for others. Again, I have a few ides, but it's still finding the time to play with the layouts and program the gorram thing. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/omg.png" alt=":omg:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I'm also debating whether or not to leave the "Survivalist? [yes/no]" block in. I thought it might be easier for newer players to be able to set that for "no" to know they'd be capped at 90% regardless, but I tend to default it to "yes" no matter what for optimal calculations. Seeing as I pretty much already have notation stating that non-survivalists are capped at 90% anyways, will probably just delete the Survivalist entry, calculate all total chances, and move the caveat next to the Total line for easier reference.

                <p>MMJ town is nearly over and i noticed soo many people who have no idea about many things posted in here about organized play.</p><p>so after seeing how organized play could make successful towns i hope all reading the world forum will take a look here as often as possible to start avoiding common mistakes or wrong strategies.</p><p>of course without shaman and souls the guide now needs some adjusting but i think if i am going to have time for that its possibly going to be in wiki not here.</p>

                <p>You're not bound to follow the guide. I think this guide is aimed to those who want to enjoy organized and strategically optimazed towns. That's only part of the players base. And also in that part only a part plays only in organized towns. This game is nice because it can be played with different styles and with different goals. You can find those that fit your enjoyment and relaxation without following this or any other guides.</p>

                <p>the answer to this is only valid in organized towns or half meta towns. it doesnt work in random towns of course:</p><p>you kill him with kindness and knowledge by showing he is wrong, promise him your own life so he could live another day, and if he still refuses then start the ignoring Mode and give up on his help and plan as if he is dead meat. and let him do whatever he wants within the limits of not hurting others or the team´s goal. <br>with time he will feel like shit for being selfish and refusing to be helpful and either change his mind or hate himself for being hated by the majority of the players he is playing with to the point of showing his true face by griefing which will get him banned or in some rare cases he will eventually quit playing. and keep in mind if he quits then no one will miss him because he was never really helpful and in most times hurting others. and the game will get more fun to play with less people who are´t interested in team play. it makes new players stick around because they wont get frustrated of failed towns.</p><p>but again this advice is not for random towns.</p>
