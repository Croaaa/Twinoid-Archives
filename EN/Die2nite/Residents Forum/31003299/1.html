These beliefs came from a number of different sources including: the Celtic, the Catholic Romans, and the Europeans. Their beliefs were just mixed all together to become the modern day version of the Halloween we know.<br><br>Most people will say that Halloween originates from the ancient times as a day that the dead could walk the Earth, again. The ancient Celtics, over two thousand years ago, would have bon fires and wear costumes, in hopes of warding off these ghosts. They believed that these ghosts could cause all types of damage, even damage to their crops. They also believed that during this time the Celetic Priests were able to make predictions about the future. The presence of these ghosts gave them this ability. This gave the Celictics comfort during the hard winter that was approaching. To celebrate the rising of the dead and the powers the priests had, bonfires were burnt, animals were sacrificed and costumes were worn.<br></span></span><br>Ghoulishly gruesome....</p><p>Everyone has ghost stories.

                <p>I will start. When I was 5 or 6...before I started school. I was asleep one night. I have 6 sisters so I was sleeping in bed with at least one. I heard a noise in the living room. The room I was sleeping in was right off the living room. I climbed over, at least one sister, and got up to find my mom.</p><p>The living room was dark and the only light was from a window. In the moonlight I saw a black woman sitting in a rocker. She wore a cloth around her head and the moonlight washed all the color away and I only saw her as whites and grays. Her dress was white, the cloth on her head was white. Her legs and shoes were dark. The noise that had wakened me was the squeak of the rockers and the handle of the broom she was holding hitting the floor as she rocked forward. Her feet did not touch the floor. She was using the broom handle to push the rocker back. So it was a squeak-tapping sound. I stood there for a bit watching her. Not once did she acknowledge me. I went back to bed, climbed over sisters and listened to her for a long while before I went back to sleep.</p><p>The main reason I know this was not a dream? Because when I went back to bed I was so scared I huddled by the wall on the bed. I was worried if I woke one of my sisters that the woman in the rocker would hurt them. So I pulled on the curtains that was on the window beside the bed and wrapped it around me. The curtains were vintage fiberglass ones and it made me itch...badly.</p>

                <p>As a young kid I had a room upstairs in a corner of the house<br>I had always hated it, and felt very bad dread whenever the light turns off were turned off. Even to this day.</p><p>I would sleep anywhere, but that room whenever I could. I would also see shadows moving/in weird shapes in that room at night.</p><p>Well, when I was 13-ish my brother was coming home with his girlfriend after college.<br> I had taken his room at that point, and had to go back to my old room for a couple nights.</p><p>On the first night I jump awake, and my eyes scan the room.<br> A lot of the stuff in the room was different. There are bat statues with red eyes near the tv, weird object, and then I notice what I was hugging in my sleep.</p><p>It this horrible discolored monsterous-thing right next to me, and my heart drops. But as I am about to run like heck, I look back, and it is my pillow.</p><p>I walk out of the room for a good 20 minutes to try to calm myself down, and convince myself everything is okay.<br> I had then reluctantly went back to sleep.</p><br><p>Unfortunately on the second night something similar happens, but nothing is in bed with me, and everything goes back to normal.</p><p>However, that morning I woke up to something I wish from the bottom of my heart it was sleep paralysis. <br> My eyes had flashed open, my heart was beating extremely hard, and I my eyes darted across the room. I had found some dark, and evil thing that to this day I have no idea what it was.</p><p>It was an ominous entity that in some ways resembled a human, it stood on two legs just like me, and you would. It had long thin limbs, squared shoulders, a pretty straight then torso, and four long fingers on each of its lanky hands. All of this lead up to a head without a neck, it was sort of like a mask, and shared the blue and purple colors of the rest of its body, but with red on its head. This head had a mask like mouth that looked like a thin straight slit was just cut into a mask. Then empty holes for eyes that was like nothing existed within them.</p><br><p>And then the threatening entity leaves after I had been awaken long enough to see its features, it turns around, and walks away in a nonhuman way, that was awkward, yet machine like.</p><p>I had then got up to go after it to see what it was, but I had found nothing. It just sort of disappeared, I didn't even find family, or even pets. I was all alone, and the only thing that was there to protect me was myself.</p><p>In the end I don't know if it was really going to hurt me, or if the unusual presence was what disturbed me. Perhaps it was some inner sense all humans have to keep them out of danger, or to warn them of other worldly things.</p><br><p>This story is 100% real, and all a first hand experience from me. It is a great rarity for stories like this to be true, but one out of many stories tend to be real.</p>

                <p>When I was 11, I would often stay the weekends with my best friend. Her family lived on a ranch. A working ranch. We would often ride her horse for hours in the vast acres they owned. I always wanted to ride double because the horses never really minded me. One day when we were out riding we came upon a small house. The roof had caved in in a few places. I wanted to stop and look. It was kinda a strange sight. A ramshackle house on the middle of no where. She was reluctant to stop. She said she was told never to go near the place. That it wasn't a place to play. But we stopped. <br>She'd stayed outside and kept telling me to hurry, hurry. But to a little girl that house was a treasure trove. <br>The front room. (And I never got past the front room) was filled with clothes, pots, dishes, piled a few feet deep. So Tammy, my friend, I could see her through the broken door way was getting increasingly worried and I would call out to her to come see. At one point I found this necklace. And that's when I got a little spooked. Like who would leave jewelry behind? I pocketed the necklace because it was a great find. I felt like anything in the little house was up for grabs. Finally I moved one pile of moldy clothes and I saw what looked like a stick of wood. I kinda pushed it out of the way and while pushing it I touched what felt like leather and saw the upper part of it. Then a foot. It was a petrified body. I only saw the legs and one foot. But that was enough. They looked like dried jerky over bone. I screamed and ran outside. Tammy kept saying we were going to be in so much trouble. When we got back to her house I went into her room and when I came back out she was standing in front of her parents who were sitting on the couch. The were having an intense conversation and I just knew it was about me. In her room I had hidden the necklace in my bag. I don't even know why. Her parents told us to go outside and play. I guess while we were outside they went through my things and got the necklace. <br>The weirdest part. I never told anyone. I felt it was that kind of secret. So I don't talk about it until I was an adult.</p>

                <p>So, I've actually been waiting for an opportunity to tell this story where I won't be absolutely scrutinized (no one I know believes me in this tale)But here we go:</p><p>For the whole time in my life I've lived with my grandparents part time and they've always had this painting of a nearby mountain and a bit of the forest and lake below it, when you look at it there's nothing out of the ordinary to the naked eye, but if you take an ultra violet emiting device (I personally have a whovian item that emits UV rays) there will be in random parts of the painting a small figure in a rather large dress that i'd describe as a wedding dress simply because of the long billowing folds at the end. the first time I noticed it I thought of it as an "Easter Egg" in the painting and figure the figure is painted in fluorescent paint hence why it's only visible under UV rays. But the figure moves when not under watch, it moves somewhere new every time I look at it, the first time I saw her she was on the lake standing there, the next she was in the trees beside it but the only place I've never seen her is the mountain nowhere near I, not the bottom or the peak. So i'll get to the point where I started noticing strange things happening, starting around Oct 27, 2008 (estimation of the date) which is near my birthday we took a family photo for the yearly Christmas cards (many of my relatives lived across the world so it took time to reach them) and if you look at the corner of the photo where I kept my chemistry set (formed of basic things for children to enjoy)you can see two things, the first being a strange mist/shadow that looks like the air became thick enough to develop light blocking qualities, the second is that the flame that would normally provide heat for certain parts of experiments was on, even as a child I knew the dangers of keeping it on and had a 3 point system to be absolutely sure it wasn't. 1. Check to see if the flame was active 2. If it was disconnect all the required parts for the flame to be active 3. put the parts back into the case, but here in this photo was the flame turned on and in front of it a shadow. When I observed the photo for the first time (about a week later) I decided not to tell anyone because obviously they'd blame me for keeping it on as I was normally a forgetful person and take my set away, but what peaked my curiosity was the shadow as for the next few years nothing happened to my knowledge. But in 2010 I was in the washroom and a flicker caught my eye moving towards my room, unlike the usual "I thought it was my parents" thing I knew no one could possibly be home at the time as the door was locked and I had the only keys in the house, the family would usually leave their keys if someone was staying in the house. Obviously the first thought that came to mind was a burglar who was apt at breaking and entering, but when I looked around the corner it wasn't a burglar, it was the figure from the painting, she was wearing the same dress as when you put the UV rays on the painting but it was obviously not a wedding dress, more of a mourning dress as it was black as the crows themselves and the bit of the dress that had caught my eye was the folds that moved longingly behind her, like a dog begging for attention. I was quite curious to see if she had literally come out of the painting or simply projected herself I always carried my UV emitting device on me simply because it looked snazzy and helped when I needed something to focus on (I have severe ADHD which didn't help me) so held the button and the sound that the device makes, to describe it, it's an electronic whirring like a drill but slowed down a bit and started scanning all over the picture. Obviously the figure did NOT like this in any way and believed I was harming the painting and as I was finishing my scan of the painting ran over to me (she did not appear hindered by her dress) and shoved me with a force that hardly felt like anything but more willed me to jump away more than normal, I must've flew at least 3 feet and the only thing that stopped me going further was the staircase that went down to the first floor had a gate in front of it. As I was getting back up she was crawling, literally lifting herself off the floor and into the painting as if there was another room inside it and falling in, I ran over with my UV device and started looking for her and eventually I found her again, just standing there. I have not seen her out of the painting since, I haven't figured out who she is or what she wanted, I still have the painting but have extreme difficulty finding her, she appears to be almost hiding from me now, if you do want an image of the painting I can provide, but I do not have a digital copy of the image that was taken on Oct, 27, 2008 and the original has been lost in a couple moves.</p>

                <p>the picture taken in 2008 I was 11 which I never "saw" her so to speak but the camera did, then in 2010 when the incident happened I was 13, so she was not very picky about ages plus I've always seen and heard things that others just can't, whether curse or gift has never been seen, and actually it did inspire me to write a creepypasta that I have yet to post anywhere</p>

                <p>So after telling that story I decided to fish the painting out of the plethora of memorabilia in the basement, after I found it I pulled out the same UV device I talk of in the story and started scanning, she's no longer there to my knowledge, though I think she is and I just haven't been able to find her, wherever she is it's like a 2d game of hide and seek, probably in the trees if I had to guess, but I can't confirm her being there, for all I know she's walking around again, either way I should mention that thanks to her I did actually develop a lot of who I am and I have her to thank for my knowledge in the paranormal since she is the one who piqued my interest, ironically i'm going to use her gift to see if maybe I can catch any signs of her (I've spent my entire life savings on several different equipments that would be used for "ghost hunting")and i'll be using them to see if maybe we can catch us a ghost. Some may call me childish and tell me to grow up, but I've got time for that later, right now i'm going to use this opportunity to try and figure out what I couldn't answer before and if possible give her closure in whatever business she has with that painting</p>

                <p>well Deblyn, I tried to provide an image of the painting, but it turns out I have the one computer on the planet that is not able to accept SD cards, Apple Devices, or pretty much any form of uploadable format on earth, trying to figure out what it actually accepts, get back once I manage to post the image somewhere, on a side not: not much from surveillance last night but I've still got 3 or 4 hours of footage to go through then the audio files are equally as long :\</p>

                <p>I remember the first time I saw something paranormal, I was around four or five in Italy. A lot of strange things happened in that house that couldn't be explained. Dying from a high fever and being brought back to life may have had something to do with it, being the knowledge of stuff happening outside the house without being there.</p><p>One memory stays in my mind though, I was sleeping on the top bunk of a bunk bed, though no one actually slept on the bottom. I really don't know why we had the bunk bed, but that's a tangent. I awoke to a noise, shuffling coming from the direction of the closet. When I opened my eyes I saw a human figure made out of my clothes, more in a pile then someone wearing them. I pretended to go back to sleep and hid my head as it moved around then I passed back to sleep. The next day I woke up seeing my clothes had moved to beside the bed rather then stuffed in the closet so my mother wouldn't complain.</p><p>A few weeks later another smaller incident happened, I awoke in the middle of the night to my army men toys marching a box across my floor. I was woken up in the morning by my mother complaining that my army men were scattered all over the floor when I had put them away before I went to sleep.</p><p>Military brats all had army men, and legos, I remember that too.</p>

                <p>I really think kids are more prone to see things. I don't think it's just fearful imaginings. I think that as kids we are more open minded.</p><p>About a week ago a friend stopped by for a quick visit. After he left I went to lay down on my bed to read. My dogs were still in the house so they lay down with me. In my office I always have the xm radio on. You can't hear it unless you are close to the door of the office. As a mention, I rarely use the office. For personal reasons I may tell about later. But the office is close to the front door. I am not telling this story for spook appeal. It's more a curiosity with me.</p><p>So I was reading about 15-20 minutes. And my 2 dogs (50+ pound cattle dogs) were asleep. Out of nowhere I hear 2 sharp whistles. The two toned dog whistles. I can't explain it any better. 2 sharp "come here" dog whistles. I don't whistle and I would have thought my dogs wouldn't even know what that sound was. But they jumped up and went running around the house looking for whoever whistled for them. My first thought was my friend came back for something but no. My dogs were kinda whining anxiously. My mom has a room upstairs and after looking around for the source of the whistle I went upstairs to ask her if she had whistled. Of course she said no. And the whistle seemed to come from inside the house. Oh and I live in the middle of ten acres. <br>I am not too spooked by it. There are a ton of birds here. I thought maybe it was a mocking jay, although I haven't seen that bird here. Just weird more than anything else. And my dogs jumped up from a sound sleep to go to the whistler.</p><p>Now my office.....is a different story.</p>

                <p>So... this is actually kind of hard for me to post, my hands are just shaking... As I said yesterday I flew to the nearest town and found stories from some other ravens, but I was not prepared for this one, just so you understand how creepy this is i'll explain the conditions I met Steven (for his privacy name has been changed as he asked) 1. I did not tell him anything about this thread nor does he play Die2Nite 2. I didn't ever tell him the story I posted here, So let's get on with the story, if you haven't read my last post please do.</p><p>Steven has been in my classes since elementary and hence we've been best friends, at one point he came out with his parents and they didn't accept this, for this reason he came to my house for a week simply to let his parents (who agreed with the decision) a bit of time to let the new info sink in, while he was here we did all the normal teenage boy stunts such as ghost stories, staying up till 5 in the morning playing video games, the norm. Steven claims not to remember the date but says it was april 2010 (6 months after the incident in my first post) he was collecting his own laundry to throw into the pile and when he was done he opened the door and the same figure I described to everyone here was standing in front of it (an important note is that the painting is right outside the bathroom door) according to him they stood for about 20 seconds before he felt anything other than shock and when he tried to move around the figure it did the same thing it did to me, a shove that feels like it wills you to move instead of actually carrying force. At this point he says the figure did again exactly what it did after it attacked(?) me, climbed back into the painting and disappeared. Obviously after the event he did not tell me otherwise I would have known, furthermore he says that a couple other people have had similar experiences in that same year at the same house with the same figure, he refused (believe I tried) to tell me them, but he did give me 3 names of people who I had over during the same year and their latest contact info so hopefully I can get these ones here to.</p><p>Also Deblyn I finally figured out how to get that image up for you but it'll be around Wednesday when I get it up</p>

                <p>My office....</p><p>When I first bought the home I am in now, about 2 years ago, there was a renter in the home. She was 50 at the time. <br>While the loan process was wrapping up, the owner I was buying from called me and told me that the renter's 30 y/o son had unexpectedly been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor and the renter asked if I would mind if he could Hospice at the home I was buying. Hospice means end of life care (less than 6 weeks) and the person dying is given comfort care only.</p><p>Let me say that.....I work in the medical field and have been with many many dying patients at their moment of death. From premature babies to the elderly.</p><p>But I never brought it home. And I never watch horror movies or movies about ghosts.</p><p>The man died the day before I was to do my final inspection. <br>I had a plan.....I was going to ask that I walk thru the house by myself at first. I didn't say why but I wanted to see if there were any vibes. I know it was childish especially with my extensive medical background. But I felt so weird about someone just dying in the house I bought.</p><p>But I When I arrived I was told the mom (the renter) had been rushed to the hospital the day before, after her son died. While on the way to the hospital she suffered 2 heart attacks and didn't survive the second one. What a tragedy!</p><p>I asked to walk the house alone....and other than all the medical equipment and the pictures on the walls of the family....I felt it didn't have any bad vibes. Just sadness.</p><p>The room downstairs they hospiced the man in...I made into an office. I only feel weird in there. And my dogs who follow me everywhere like I am their holy grail, even to the point they lay at my feet while I brush my teeth....won't stay with me in the office. I rarely go in there. Again, I know its childish but it bothers me and I think my dogs sense it.</p><p>Then the SWAT team came....but that's another story</p>

                <p>My spooky story starts with me waking up around 4 am one morning to be confronted with what i can only describe as a very dark shadow..yes it was night time but with the lights from outside i could see this <strong>thing</strong>, darker than anything else i had ever seen, it started to get bigger and to move forward and as i was lying in bed having just woke up i wasn't sure exactly what it was and if my mind was playing tricks on me..so i turned back over to go back to sleep but the next thing i knew it seemed to be lying on top of me.. i couldn't turn back over to see what was on top of me, i couldn't move my arms to free myself from under my quilt and then it started to shake me and the bed ..it felt like a mini tremor that's when i really started to get scared so i started shouting get off me get off me get off me but the more i shouted the more it shook me and the bed in the end i just screamed out loud ( bearing in mind i'm an older male ) then after a few loud scream by myself it just vanished into thin air, leaving me unharmed but dripping with sweat.</p>

                <p>Othimos, are you sure that couldn't have been sleep paralysis? While normally you can't move at all it could be possible to move, and most victims of sleep paralysis claim to see darker figures than the shadows around them, not calling you a liar, but it could be a logical explanation, though again, a few things seem off for it to be sleep paralysis it's always a possibility. If it is sleep paralysis then that shadow was simply your own nightmares leaking into your reality because you should be asleep and dreaming</p>

                <p>One of my numerous credentials is as a registered sleep therapist.</p><p>Sleep paralysis is really disrupted REM sleep. Its when the brain has transitioned to rapid eye movement sleep from delta sleep. Its a pretty powerful nightmare that wakes you during REM sleep.</p><p>If you are woken during this time you may experience a brief period of atonia.</p>

                <p>Its actually pretty cool! To watch brain waves and know where people are at in their head.</p><p>1st stage of sleep. Theta waves. Most people will tell you they are not asleep even if you hear them snoring.</p><p>2nd stage. Beta waves: Slow eye movement. <br>(They are asleep but can respond to questions if asked...this is the stage most people go into under hypnosis)</p><p>3rd stage. Alpha waves. Dreaming but can wake with clear memories of the dreams. This stage is where you dream of falling and jerk awake...or think you hear some one calling you. Also when you have the sometimes whole body jerk. People that have sleep problems never go past this stage. They have frequent (100s) of apnea, where they stop breathing for up to a few minutes each time. The body goes into survival mode and wakes itself up. They can "sleep" 10 hours and wake up exhausted.</p><p>4th stage. Delta waves. Growing, hormonal sleep, therapeutic. Rejuvenating. <br>(teenage boys in particular will sleep a lot during this stage. This is when they will do all their growing spurts. IF they don't get enough sleep that could affect height, testosterone levels etc....)</p><p>5th stage <br>REM sleep, deep paralytic sleep. rapid eye movement.</p><p>And the typical cycle of 5 stages only last 90 minutes and you have 4-5 of the 90 minute episodes in a good night's sleep.</p><p>I watch 8-12 hours of recorded sleep sent to me. Scoring what stage they are in every 30 seconds. Which is called an Epoch. I specialize in children that need ventilator adjustments or need to be assessed for critical recovery to make sure they will survive serious surgeries.</p><p>I give reports on kids from Madrid, France, India, Barcelona....all over the world. I am taking a hiatus from my real career and only doing this for a bit.</p><p>Edit!!!!! Sorry I wrote a whole page on it. I think I am kinda passionate about it. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>That's some interesting info on sleep, for some reason I thought of each of the 4 stages taking 1hr with rem after stage 2, but looking it up now and every site has the stage "cut-off" set up a bit differently and the progression varies through the night, looks like nothing is ever simple <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/cgu.gif" alt=":anim_chart:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I have never experienced anything definitely supernatural, so I had to think hard for the closest thing to it, and...</p><p>Sometime in the last few years, while on the way to city during the morning rush hour, I was facing <a target="_blank" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/TangaraTrailerInternal.jpg/474px-TangaraTrailerInternal.jpg">one set of train doors</a> (doors are located on each side of the carriage and are mostly see-through plastic/glass) and looking outside. Towards the end of the trip, the train enters a subway tunnel and due to the darkness outside and light inside, I can now see reflections of people behind me.</p><p>I noticed one little girl that stood out simply due to being the only kid amongst all the grownups and seemingly not with anyone (not talking to anyone or holding someone's hand) just standing there, being still and looking into the distance. There are often quite a few schoolkids on the trains, though maybe school holidays were on or they just weren't in that carriage then.</p><p>Nothing too unusual, just seemingly out of place which is why I noticed. Soon after the train was coming up to the station and I turned around to get ready to exit via the other door. Then I noticed that the little girl from just before was nowhere to be seen. Is she standing in front of someone and obstructed from my line of sight? Did she move somewhere? Made me look left-right, tilt my head curiously, while at the same time smiling (inside my head) and thinking what is this a non-scary low budget version of The Ring? I will surely spot her soon as the doors open and people start moving. Nope, not a trace, strange, normally I am sharp and notice people moving, especially when there's nothing else to do but stand there and look.</p><p>And that was that, guess that being so small it would be easy for her to move between all the people, maybe she went up the carriage as they were coming down or similar or I just missed something obvious being morning and all and not really paying much attention to her. Maybe if she was wearing pyjamas, had a bloody tomahawk in her hand or looked wet like she just climbed out of the well, then I'd have been more vigilant <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":sq_happy:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>In any case, either people are making stories up or ghosts are not very smart by doing the same thing in the same place over and over or they are just enjoying trolling people for fun <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/bg.gif" alt=":cool:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I have had a lot of little odd instances that stay on my mind longer than they should. But I don't think they are supernatural.

                <p>Sorry guys no images of this painting are ever coming to the web after this morning's events, I am considering burning it this instant, but to sum it up: the most terrifying experience I could have in my life.</p><p>This morning I got ready to leave for the bus and as I was leaving I realized I had left my cell phone in my bedroom, so I go upstairs to grab it, I couldn't find it until I looked under the pillows, which isn't right it shouldn't be there I am very OCD about where I leave important objects. I grabbed it and started trundling back downstairs towards the door, as I started down the stairs (right beside the painting, and the same stairs in my first post)I felt something that i'd describe like a Canadian Winter focused on two spots on my back, I lost complete control over my body (though this was out of fear not any body reactions) obviously I fell down the stairs and when I hit the bottom there she was, standing on the top step, she didn't move this time, no climbing into the painting, or on the roof excorcist style. Simply standing there, and that was probably the most maddening part, I eventually passed out or something of the like I don't have much memory other than laying there completely numb, and then nothing. I woke up four hours later still on the floor and the figure was gone.</p><p>I will still post the stories that I find out tomorrow from the other 3 people who claim to have experienced the figure, but the painting is being burned and all digital copies erased, It is possible the figure is unrelated to the painting but it's obviously the current housing and possibly a conduit for her energy, Best scenario, I get rid of her, worst case i'm only stalling</p>

                <p>Yes, right now i'm trying to make sure i get the facts straight, i had to sack one story because it was rather obvious the guy who told me this one has read this thread and just switched a few details, and yes Saucy i have got 3 more chapters but something just doesn't feel right in them, like i'm forgetting a detail i planned and that's not good for me when i plan i make a solid plan that accounts for every detail so somewhere along the line i will mess up and make an error that wil bug me for eternity</p>
