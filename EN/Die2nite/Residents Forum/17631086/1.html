                <p>Alright, here's my idea and I hope you bear with me for the duration of the time I might waste. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":sq_happy:" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Now, Distant Region Towns are pretty big.... Why not split the town in half and create two different towns that are competing against one another? The last people standing in one of the towns makes that town the winner! <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Of course, there's more to the idea.. THat's just the general theme.</p><p>Towns must be around 13-15 AP away. That way you could still have the other town reach you, but it'd take resources. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Zeds will NOT be split evenly, the only evenness of the two towns would be the fact that they've both got only 20 residents. Attacking another citizen is the normal chance of success.... But if you have a weapon such as a Battery Launcher, you'd be able to attack them as if they were just a normal zed.</p><p>There'd be a normal forum that both sides could use, and then a seperate forum only one side could use. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>OTHER IDEA!</strong></p><p>You know those buildings out in the WB? What if we could make semi towns there? Different from camping because you'd get zed attacks and you could have more then one person stay there!<br>Each building out in the wastes is different.... So, why not have the requirements for each one to become a mini-town different?</p><p>Take the Small House for example, if you have 4 Twisted Planks to board it all up, and two wrought irons.... (on the ground and/or in your rucksack) you can build up the House for 6-14 Ap!<br>After it's been built, four people can occupy the home. You'll get building options(BP's would not work here) but you won't get a lot. You'll get something along the lines of <strong>Fortified Barricade, Mini-Pit, Spiked Mini-Pit, Makeshift Tower, Big Lock, etc.</strong> It'd be just like the town, needing resources from the surrounding area, only that it'd be different. Ap costs and names, along with resources needed would be all varrying things, but that's the general idea. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Some buildings would have more advantages then others,Wrecked cars would cost more AP to build up.. But you'd receive a higher base mini-town defense for your efforts, while the citizens home would be easy to build up, but only two people would be able to live there, and it wouldn't have the best things to build, some would be just temp defense... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>The second idea is better but I'd like to hear your imput on both of thee ideas... The first one was probably submitted beforehand, but maybe not. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy.png" alt=":sq_happy:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>This reminds me of a image from another thread...<a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/owFA4.jpg">dual town</a>...</p><p>But anyway dual town maps have popped up a few times on the forums. Not to say they're not a good idea, I actually think they could be a lot of fun if they got the mechanics right. But I feel like it would be more like making a whole new game instead of a new type of town, from a programming stand point atleast.</p>

                <p>Ah... But you forget that you need all the resources, and the AP to do it.... Plus, the shunned need a place to go. I don't think all that time in town haveing things thrown at you and all the slanderous names is good for your mental health....<strong></strong> <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>I don't see why the higher number of people in town would cause YOUR mini-town to be attacked more... If anything, it should be less.

                <p>Well, instead of "makeshift towns" I would call them "fortified buildings" or just "safehouses". The suggestion was all fine until the "available only to shunned people" part.</p><p>Being shunned is an undesirable punishment. You don't want to help shunned people. You want them to go out to the World Beyond to think about what they did to get shunned while they're being eaten by zombies. I can imagine that people would actually want to be shunned by the other citizens to make use of this feature, which makes no sense. Just let the shunned citizens search the refuse as they dream about the day in which they will rise and revolt, though if they're searching the refuse they must be (and smell) quite revolting already <img src="../../../../gfx/square/hmm.png" alt=":-/" class="tid_ico">.</p><p>Now, why I like about this idea is that it could provide a better alternative to camping. You could make those fortified safehouses to take expeditions even further. You could use the safehouses to store supplies for the trip by making a mini-bank (along with a mini-registry to see who puts and takes items) and spend the night there. Of course, surviving the night would not grant a distinction like camping. The defenses could be damaged each night (like HC constructions) too. Possibilities are endless!</p>

                <p>The shunned thing was a neat idea, but yeah... You bring up the good point. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>And yes! The ideas are endless for this! The hardcore building thing is another, great idea to balance this out! How about, not only does the amount of people in town effect the attack<em>(with coro's foggy camp-like attack estimate thing going on)</em> but the amount of people at the place for the night also effects it?</p><p>It'd be a great place for a small spot to go and sleep out for those longer range expeditions. You could have a tamer at the fortification, and a scavenger there as well, and the two work as a team digging up rare stuff far away from town... And the dog sends it back! Those two classes get more light shone on them in the process and are therefor more important.... <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It's also ideal for citizens, as the longer ranged scavenging trips are near impossible.... But with the fortifications in place(or whatever the name will be) they can do longer ranged trips! <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Great for endgame, and they have a purpose for other then endgame.... I'm loving the idea right now..... Can anyone else add on this? <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>About makeing it for the shunned people only, eh... As Colette says, being shunned is <strong>NOT</strong> supposed to be a privilege, however, I think that shunned people should be able to set up a town still, but shunned people get more options at the barricades, first off... They have a option to make this barricade their new home, and thus are now seperate forever and ever from the real town. They can't be meat lockered, nor hung, they are on their own fully. Thanks THomas for the idea....</p><p>But think, ideas should be friendly to all pllay styles.... You like messing with the town, or you think the town is going to shit and everyone is playing a extreme game of hangman, you can make the barricade your home for good..... Heroic Returns would send you back to the baricade as it's your town essentially. You can also just have the option to sleep their for the night, but unless you live their, you have to press aoption to sleep there, because some buildings will only have a set amount of space for people... If you live their and your in town you do this automaticly. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Good?</p>

It's about crime and punishment. Being shunned on purpose makes no sense at all. Perhaps the shunned could still enter safehouses, build their own and help barricading them, but they still shouldn't be able to take items from them. This safehouse thing shouldn't be a shunned-exclusive, Hero-only or Chaos-only feature.</p><p>Also, I'm against separating the shunned, or any other citizen from the town. They still are one of the 40 citizens, and they should still be able to be dragged back to town to be hanged when necessary. From my point of view, safehouses are supposed to be shelters to spend the night on (instead of taking your chances with camping) and to stockpile items for expeditions rather than new mini-towns so people could go there and abandon the town.</p>

                <p>Well, you could live there in theory, as long as you brought your water or someone else stashed some in there. Survivalists could probably live there without much problems. Either way, they would need to barricade and protect it. As for separating from the town, I don't think it would be a good idea. People taking shelter there would still have a house at the town, and the community could drag them to justice if needed. I envision Safehouses as temporary shelters to spend the night and stockpile items, a place to hide while you recover your breath and sleep for a bit, to explore the World Beyond further without the inherent risks of camping. It should not be a new permanent home for people to isolate themselves from the community.</p>

                <p>Right.... All of that is good, but I'm thinking of having another home at the safe house, not detaching yourself completely as you pointed out why it'd be bad... But I'm thinking of a mini home that you can go to when the town goes to shit, and also for the idea that if too many people are there you have a gaurenteed spot there.</p><p>The idea of making it to where you have to bring water there is stupid. This is a refuge to make it to where OTHER classes then the stupid camping people with books that are like shaman masks but instead let them find water magically, the safehouse spot will have buildings. Why not water based ones then?</p><p>Water catcher will be available, as will a mini well that gives 10-20 water rations. However, before it's stated that it's OP or anything, let it be known that you can't upgrade the buildings and it costs resources to build this mini well, perhaps more then the normal well. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>I'm thinking on this from a more realistic point of view. We have a town because of the well, not the other way around. I mean, we're on a desert. You don't go around finding wells everywhere. Water-catching constructions could be added, but they should only add a few rations to the storage. I don't think the safehouse should be a shelter in case the town goes wrong. I imagine that people would flee the town at the first bad sign, like rats from a sinking ship. Instead, I'd like a stop point for exploration, to recover AP, store items and have a chance to live outside for a few days without playing Russian roulette by camping.</p>

                <p>Well, instead of giving the makeshifts/safehouses their own constructions, why not give each building a set of different stats? Some would have more water available, others would have better defense, less chance of waking up terrorized (had an idea where using a makeshift, <strong>not</strong> camping, to survive a night outside leaves you with a chance to wake up terrorized), etc etc ad infinitum. This would also give you the chance to improve the building, not just the zone.</p>

                <p>Bah, that's not a wall of text. Too small. And I never mentioned that each town could have one and only one safehouse per map... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/confused.png" alt=":{" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Anyway, the point of having special safehouses instead of buildings is to leave buildings untouched. You don't want to make them useless or cause interference with existing features. That's for several reasons. For example, I wouldn't want to mess up with the buildings' functionality. Buildings are just that, abandoned buildings. Most of them are different to each other, they contain supplies, provide cover for camping and have a blueprint to get if you do. Safehouses, on the other hand, are constructions made with protection in mind, like fallout shelters or something like that. They contain the supplies you expect to find in such a place, like a few cans of food and water. You can't camp in there, so you get no blueprints. It's basically an alternative to camping, not a replacement for camping.</p><p>Now, turning all buildings into fortresses sounds good at the start, but it isn't so good if you think about it. Let's take your example, the Old Hydraulic Pump. How in the world would you fortify an Hydraulic Pump? Even if you could, a good fortified building would need to be as inconspicuous as possible and an Hydraulic pump surrounded by bits of barbed wire would be like a lighthouse to guide zombies to it. Even making those nitpicky details aside, I wouldn't think it's a good idea to make multiple places available for people to stay outside.</p><p>About the attacks, I believe it should be a little different from just making them safer as distance increases. For example, we could have a camouflage option for the building's upgrade options, which increases the chances of being killed. Crowded safehouses should be easier to spot than lone ones, and staying there multiple times in a row should reduce your chances too. And when the town is destroyed, the hungry zombies that attacked the town will lurk around the desert looking for food, so survival chances are greatly reduced.</p><p>As I've said before, the purpose for this feature would be to provide a safer place to spend the night outside, not a replacement or alternative to the existing town. Just my opinion.</p>

                <p>well, i've read everyone's posts and i'll post what i think:<br>i'm against making singular buildings that can be used as makeshift towns/safehouses, the abandoned buildings should be used because i don't think a person would go in the middle of the desert in a zombie apocalypse and be picky about what place he/she would use as shelter<br>The place should have it's own bank(please stop using "mini", it's a little annoying) but it should have a limit on how many items could be stored, i also agree with TailsTheeFox that the place should have a house-like section so that you could have your own space and be able to make the place safer for you, but i think that this house-like thing should be stealable, i mean, you go to a house in the middle of the desert and you see a corner with some planks and iron parts in a defencive position with a name on them and just because it has a name you don't use that for yourself?<br>About the well: i agree that ir is a little unrealistic to have a well anywhere you want in a desert but i also agree that the place should have a way to have it's own water, maybe making the water catcher a permanent construction on safehouses/makeshift towns.<br>i think that you should be able to fortify the place in some aspects like: makeshift pit, makeshift barricade(that should open two new options: makeshift door barricade and makeshift windows barricade(this options only available in some places like the small house)), makeshift fence/wall(or maybe these two being linked like: fence opens the option to do a wall), makeshift etc. another idea: what if there was a really strong construction that took a LOT of AP to make but would only be available when the main town was on chaos? like a pyramid-like structure made of wrought iron that would be made with the original building inside(that's crazy but its just to picture what i'm saying)<br>Final idea: how about the place not taking damage from the nights attack if there is no one inside? i don't think the zombies will attack a empty place</p>

                <p>The "mini" annoyance cannot be compared to the "makeshift" one... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico"></p><p>It's not about being picky, it's that not every place <strong>can</strong> be fortified. Remember the example of the hydraulic pump. How can you fortify an hydraulic pump? The fact that safehouses could be purpose-made shelters doesn't screw the buildings original functionality and makes it have sense. Keep in mind that you could still <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_camp.gif" alt=":hordes_camp:" class="tid_ico"> <strong>camp</strong> outside buildings and use them as hideouts. Being able to fortify a building makes camping useless. Why hiding in a ruin if you can make a fortress out of it? That's the reason why safehouses should be independent buildings.</p><p>A safehouse could have an Storage instead of a bank, which has items inside from the start. Items may vary depending on the kind of safehouse, a bigger safehouse could have better or more items, for example. Things go inside the storage, which has its own falsifiable mini-register (sorry, I can't find anything that could describe it better). You could "steal" items from there, but obviously it wouldn't grant any distinction. A safehouse cannot belong to a citizen, so it doesn't have chests and decorations cannot be placed there.</p><p>About constructions, several options could be added depending on the type of safehouses. Smaller safehouses could have less and weaker constructions that take less materials and AP, while bigger safehouses would have bigger, stronger, difficult-to-build options. Just keep in mind that you don't want citizens to abandon the town to live in a safehouse. You want citizens to use safehouses to take shelter outside without the risks of camping.</p>

Now to find some resources to board this place up.</em></p><p>This could be a standard message for any safehouse you find, you would have to build them up to make them secure like tails' original idea, and if you want to add other elements have safehouses that start with water, food, pure resources or defense already there before you start building.</p><p>I don't know if this is just mimicing what everyone has already said but just my input.</p>

You could build it up in any zone after a certain amount of APs or KMs from town, and it would provide slightly better chances and a bank with categories to make it easy to look through items. Its function would be to provide slightly better camping chances for people to move further from town and act as a storage for important items so you don't have to go all the way back to town to get them after chaos. You'll have the option to build a few buildings to add defence. Maybe you can even dig a well out but it would require a lot of APs. And of course, you should only be able to make one makeshift town per town.</p><p>^I realise I'm just compiling stuff from the thread, but this is the way I imagine it working. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Actually, I just got another idea (retaking one from a post somewhere before), but it'll be derailing the thread a bit and there is a spoiler about Hordes' S6. I'll just make it short: we can make these makeshift towns a kind of "decoy" (what's the right words for it?) to lure the zeds there from the main town. Camping there would be close to suicide, but I think it's better that then the <span class="tid_wspoil">watchmen. </span></p>

I would like a feature that could keep me safe outside just for a couple of days, offering some of the town's functionality and benefits.</p><p>What I would dislike is a feature too common and overpowered that people could abuse.
