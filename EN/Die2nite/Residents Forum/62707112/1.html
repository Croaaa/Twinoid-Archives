                <p>If there was any change to fix griefing made by MT in the first place then it'd be possible for the best one of all: MT comes back and handles griefing manually. Unless coding is easier than manual checking I'd prefer the manual checks. Soul points + no shuns wouldn't work because eventually that hero will be shunned by the griefers unless only playing in a full meta.</p><p>The easiest thing for MT to do is allow TRUSTED, yes trusted, players who will moderate/be able to ban the players instead of the devs. If there is signs of corruption with the newly appointed mods then MT would just check for proof and that's about it.</p>

                <p>I agree with Miudo, there is absolutely no way to stop people from hanging other people. Whatever the reason for the hanging is. Of course you can reduce the odds but you can't stop it from happening completely.</p><p>But the issue here isn't 8 people deciding to hang someone with or without a reason.</p><p>The issue is the recent multiplication of multi-accounts. Being able to play 5 or more people at the same time upsets the game balance just too much and thus makes everything dull. I played a town recently with a "friend" that turned to have a good number of account in the current town. We got everything we wanted without any effort, really tasteless. Felt as if I was part of a Meta.</p><p>I'm not the kind of person that play by the rules but what I witnessed in that town didn't fill me with joy. Of course I could convince that person to stop playing with that many account but that wouldn't solve the issue as he is just one of the many person doing it.</p><p>Sadly the only way to solve the multi-accounts crisis is to have the moderation step in and not by any "ingame mechanics"<br>There is a crow that comes from time to time if I'm not mistaken. Like once every month I guess? And just to moderate the world forum from what I saw.</p><p>I don't know if that crow is an inactive player or a staff member of Motion twin. If he's a staff member there is probably nothing to do as their choice to abandon die2nite is calculated but if it's a player then maybe there is a way to negotiate the password to the crow account.</p><p>Miudo, do you have any idea if it's doable?</p>

                <p>It isn't doable and you should desist of such attempt now if you value your pictos.</p><p>The last moderation we had here recently was clearly made by some external mod. It was clearly someone that just went through the reports pile and made a quick judgment of what was there and waved its hammer, hitting whoever was there.</p><p>Which means that griefers could even get decent players handicapped now if they go report threads all over. <span class="tid_sideNote">I shouldn't haven mentioned this... <img src="../../../../gfx/square/facepalm.png" alt=":fp:" class="tid_ico"></span></p><p>You are a french player so you know how moderation is hard-headed when it comes to following the rules. They won't take our side or go into a paladin's quest to get evil-doers punished with whatever tools they have. Not going to happen.</p><p>Moderation is a volunteer job and since you have to deal with other people sheep is prob not a nice job too. I understand why our old mods no longer watch over us as the only thing that increased with time here was the amount of carp that needs to be moderated.</p><p>So yeah, just move on. Play the game knowing that bad things will happen occasional and well, the end of times are soon upon us anyway.</p>
