                <p>So, i see a lot of people who refer to metas with distaste and annoyance, and i'm not really sure why. I understand some might find the random element fun, but in a game that requires such cooperation like this, wouldn't a meta be a form of the ultimate goal?</p><p>If you can get a meta going, you can cut out the number of griefers who show up and ruin a town. New players can be taught by the meta how the game works and strats, and experienced players can work with people that they enjoy.</p><p>I get that some players, especially those in a meta, might be too overbearing with demands about "the proper way to do things", and that's a fair criticism, but I feel like, at worst, they can just be ignored.</p><p>Can someone please explain why Metas are so looked down upon?</p>

                <p>They aren't "so looked down"... There's just a handful of people that are very active on the World Forum since ever and that know it was the metaplay's fault (altogether with other factors, i know) that turned this game into something the devs didn't want it to become. So they abandoned us.</p><p>Judging by your Beta title and your soul I think a post worth reading is this one: <a href="http://twd.io/e/lvKy0w" target="_blank">http://twd.io/e/lvKy0w</a> it is from someone that played at around the same Age you did and came back to d2n during the shitty years.<span class="tid_sideNote">Yeah, shitty years are 2015-now</span></p><p>There's waaaaaaay to many things to read about it too. I suggest you use the forum Search system and keywords such as "meta" "hate" etc...</p><p>And congrats, your post will be just another one to the list.</p>

                <p>My dear @Schreo, do I need to remind you that Dead Cells started with the title "Hordes Zero"? That it was going to be something the devs said: "The spiritual successor of Hordes/Die2nite"?</p><p>Why would the devs call their new game like that if not because they were butthurt of what we (and Hordes people) did to their games?</p><p><span class="tid_sideNote">If you still find it bullshit go check the early posts of the Dead Cells forum here on Twinoid, or just this post <a href="http://twd.io/e/oVNL0w" target="_blank">http://twd.io/e/oVNL0w</a></span></p><p>Also, the shitty years of this game started ages before Hordes Zero or whatever carp it became now. You surely remember Mush and the other new games that were MT's attempt to score a big hit (Arkadeo etc..)</p><p>So ye, Die2nte was decrepit way before DC.</p><p>Now I agree that one of the reasons why our game is in bad shape is because of MT's constant quest to make a new game that would lift them to glory.</p><p>...which they did now with DC. I'm very happy for them, although it hurts that they decide to abandon us even though it wouldn't cost them a thing to just reset the leaderboards and delete a griefer or two once in a while.</p><p>Will they do it? No, they wont even move a muscle to save us from the death of Flash or whatever that implies.</p><p>And as my last point here, they still get lots of money from us (well, mostly Hordes). Hordes was a real gem they did, they just poorly managed it and decide to turn into several languages in attempt to reach the World, which was also a failure.</p><p>They only succeed with DC because they got someone to do the advertising for them, Steam made MT's art-made-games to work. MT themselves were lousy advertisers. They never gave us mechanics for referral (or even to say what they should do to improve our game, they never ever listened to us in ANY single Season change...).</p><p>and im too old for this sheep... you young people should go and read all posts before making threads like this...</p>

                <p>MT did that because we asked a lot, nearly petitioned it.</p><p>As spacey mention in the thread we talked about the meta cap made many players stop playing and it was bad... at first. That cap we had was different from the cap Hordes has today, which is more bland.</p><p>But we can't compare a meta cap when the game was flourishing and had tons of players (like we had when it was lifted) with a meta cap now, which would force decent players to mix with average players in a somewhat healthy mix.</p><p>Will some players leave the game for good if such metacap was put into play? Sure. However some would stay and the quality of the random towns (which would be the only kind of town) would increase enormously.</p><p>Do we even need MT to achieve that? Nope. All it takes is those cocky meta players to climb down from their webbed and stale leaderboards and get them to play with the regulars that are still left.</p><p>Will they do it? Nope. I know what is like to be in a meta and have other people playing as you would like everyone to play. Very few mistakes, everyone in a good mood, etc. It is a bold move to decide to abandon this and, let's say, go and play Small Maps and teach noobs.</p><p>How many community events have been made recently? None. Several attempts and ideas were posted and nothing happens because the decent players are inside the cozy metas and don't want to socialize with other people. They don't want to waste their precious hero days with a town that doesn't promise them something shiny</p><p>Are they wrong to think like that? Nope... That's just their choice and we all must respect that. But this doesn't change the fact, and I bold <strong>fact</strong>, that metas are killing the game right now.</p><p>Word from someone that played in a meta for years and doesn't regret what he had done and the good times he spent playing like that. It is just easy to go and defend metas or metaplay, but the truth is there for all to see.</p>

                <p>A 'proper' meta is boring AF. You have to wait hours after the attack to receive your specific instructions which are not to be deviated from. At that point, it's better to have one person and 39 alt accounts.</p><p>But a 'loose' meta is fun, you're just expected to try to do the right thing. Like random towns were, back before the shaman update. The first shaman update, god that was bad. That was about the time i stopped playing.</p><p>But yeah, we're in a world where griefer/multi accounts are running rampant, and people get shunned/hung just for the fun of it. I wouldn't recommend randoms right now just because of that. But it's all borrowed time until flash shuts down.</p><p>WTF is this dead cells s***? I played platformers back in the 80s/90s, why is this popular now? Meanwhile die2nite is the only game of it's type on the market, aside from grimmwood which looked good but has less than 10 players a month and requires 40 to fill a town.</p>

                <p>I do agree with Saran when it comes to griefers.</p><p>I feel like a lot of those people who grief we're involved in meta's and did something stupid, We're kicked and ended up creating multi accounts for revenge. They sit there waiting for the perfect moment to jump with your meta.</p><p>In many other cases for new players, a lot of them could have made such a minuscule mistake like making a hovel or mixing pharma's...etc and citizens in the town freaked out and decided to take their "Punishment for such actions" to the next level. In turn upsetting the one who was punished to decide to grief towns. There are many other examples that make new players hate die2nite.</p><p>personally enjoy solid teamwork with meta's and organized towns BUT, At the same time i enjoy wreaking havoc. It keeps this game from getting stale after almost a decade of playing.</p>

                <p>Answering op question: meta means exploring game at it's full potential, but it takes study, effort, teamwork, patience, a good planner, etc</p><p>In other words, meta playing means success if you don't consider the fun aspect the one and only factor when playing a game. And success mean, by definition only a few people can achieve it due to the difficulty and offort needed. Therefore, people not capable of achieving this will envy the results of the successful ones and resent it, trying to degrade the ones tht got there to feel better with themselves. It's the basic loser's mindset. If you don't get what it takes to climb up, try to pull down who did.</p><p>It's not different to what happens in any field on real life.</p>

                <p>D2n profit is and was irrelevant for MT. It wasn't the cause of d2n's failure on MT's eyes. MT still kept it (and other failure games) running so players from their other average-ish success games could come and get the pictos, titles and kill some time between the daily renewal of plays on all of those games. If they still can get some bucks to help pay for the server maintenance costs, great.</p><p>Hordes was one of these average-ish success games and, surprise, they have both meta and random play there. It is possible to have the two things, but when MT applied the ranking system, enticing us to compete for the leaderboards, we weren't ready for what that meant.</p><p>We needed more users; Hordes had 2 years more of experience and a lot of advertisement (their referral system worked) if compared to us. Ask around how people found out about die2nite... Many will say they found an advertisement of the game inside another game from MT. They barely advertised it elsewhere. I myself found it in an ad while playing Alphabounce.</p><p>So we got all Hordes had, munched and spat with one or two tweaks here and there. How can it possible fail? Well it did. First, because we are not frenchies, and secondly, because d2n is a different game altogether. ANY aspect of the game would need a different approach from MT to make it work. From moderation to payment to thinking of events that would engage us.</p><p>We had one specific Admin that helped things to work somehow (<span class="tid_user tid_user_14 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="14">epoq</span>), then we had another admin that got the train nearly derailing already and didn't helped much. It was so much effort for them to keep d2n interesting for their unique user-base.</p><p>On our first days of competition it was exciting for those involved, but little by little the decent players hanging around at random towns were diminishing. This led to less decent players joining metas so less players renewing them too, so metas started to vanish too. Add that the fact MT stopped making new content to the game and you have a vicious cycle.</p><p>So i repeat, metas were /one/ of the reasons why this game failed. There were others: early introduction of leaderboards, lifting of meta-cap, lack of administration, lack of advertisement, sharp learning curve, et... but you can't deny that meta gaming wasn't involved.</p><p>I know it is hard to see this when yu haven't followed this game from the very beginning and you only have the forum threads from when the Merge with Twinoid happened... In any case, if you still think metas has nothing to do with this game demise, you cannot say it is contributing for something or "making it better" or that "it is the solution of this game" too :p</p>
