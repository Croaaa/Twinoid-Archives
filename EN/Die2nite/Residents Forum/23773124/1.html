                <p>Here's the prologue to the novel I am currently working on. It is based off of die2nite, the monkey on my back. Enjoy.</p><p><em> The door blew open with an explosive element, sending wooden shrapnel inward, toward the cowering old man. The old man hid under his bed, tears protruded through his large blue eyes. The tears dribbled down through the chin of the clay mask he wore, the first of anything to leak out of the mask since the old masked man put it on. Screams erupted through the now open doorway, horrible inhumane pleas. He looked up from under the bed he was concealed under, and with faint confusion peered at the black boots that had splintered his door. Questions zipped through his head, which was completely engulfed in survival instincts, which he had accumulated over the endless tortures. A familiar voice sent snakes up his spine.<br>“What, is this not what you expected to see?”<br>The invader kicked the mattress, revealing the old masked man. The old masked man looked up, his confused expression hidden behind his clay mask. Memories slammed his mind like a wave, threats of revenge by the sneering monstrosity that stood above him.<br>“I want to see behind that disguise, feel your soul slip from your shrivelled husk, witness it attempt to escape and see the fear in your eyes as I whisk it away, just as I watched you take his”.<br>The old masked man opened his mouth to protest but a large hand wrapped around his throat. He felt claws tear into his cheek as the clay mask was ripped from his face. The monster sneered triumphantly. It reached into it’s pocket and brought out a tool of destruction so terrifying the old man soiled himself. He struggled with all his might, wriggling around, trying to slip his way out his restraint. This pleased the monster, it giggled in delight. The cold iron of its weapon pressed up against the old man’s forehead. The old man screamed, his legs kicking, his nose erupted, sliming the hand that gripped him in place. The monster was unmoved. It pulled back a lever with it’s thumb, and pulled the bottom trigger with it’s index finger. With a shattering explosion the steel projectile slammed into the old man, who immediately collapsed. The monster kicked the corpse. It’s sneer turned into an unsatisfied snarl. It levelled the weapon and fired several more times, then spat into the hole where the old man’s face once was. Then it turned and left, back into the dark turmoil that raged outside. A raven overhead circled the house a few times, then followed the monster in black boots. Their work was far from finished.<br></em></p>

                <p><em><span class="tid_sideNote">Well page 150 has been finished in the freezing tundra of Canada's northern Ontario. So how about a snippet because I'm a narcissist.<br></span></em></p><p>Max and Glen had split up. Max went east and Glen went west. The ground Max tread on was perfectly flat, but between the sand trying to suck him into its depths, and the heat leeching him of his strength, the walk was challenging. But he had walked these lands before, many times, and he had become accustomed to their struggles. He had also become perceptive in the search. He stopped walking at a sense he had picked up from the sands, a tingle he felt in between his toes. He bent down and began digging his hands into the pale flesh of the earth. The sand did not like being upturned as it was, and kept piling in on every scoop Max took. It was a slow and tiresome process, but little by little he dug deeper into the earth. One foot, two feet, three feet… until around four feet down his fingernails struck a solid. Long ago this would of shattered his fingernails, but after an eternity of physical torment his hands had become as strong as iron, his palms covered in permanent callus’, his fingernails like steel. With a great heave he wretched the object up out of the earth, and claimed his prize. A single plank of wood, twisted about by the sand that had been digesting it. He smiled in pride, and peered up at the sun. He still had a long time before sunset to keep searching, so he kept pacing east. Three more times he dug, and three more times he uncovered a new object. He looked down at his collection, a plank of wood, an old broken rocking chair, and two pieces of junk metal. Peering up at the cruel sun, he decided it was time to go back. He piled up his loot in the rocking chair, took a sip from his ration, and turned to head back to town. He could just make it out, it was smaller then his thumb from his distance, the only bastion remotely safe to survive the night. A cry for help stopped him from his goal, a distant shout coming from the north. He followed the shout with his eyes, searching for its creator. He caught sight of a blot in the distance; it seemed to be a building sprout out from the ground. Further staring revealed a silhouette running around on the roof, bellowing the pleas for assistance. Max sighed. He fingered the scar across his palm, focusing his attention away from the sun, away from the sand, away from himself. He indulged his focus into the scar, he felt the groove along either side of its peak, felt the hardened cast that had formed after the claws incision, thought of the transition he and Glen had made. He called out to Glen, through his scar, through his blood, the blood he and Glen shared. “I need some help buddy”. He felt his hearts’ beat quicken, their shared blood rushed through his system, sending Glen’s answer from his heart to his head.<br><em>“What’s wrong? Are you ok, did they get you?”<br>“No, I’m fine, but I’ve come to a fork in the path.”<br>“A fork? It’s a little too barren out here for ‘forks in the path’.”<br>“Some guys screaming for help out north of me. He’s standing on something tall, so it’s probably a building. Sun’s going to start setting soon, and I don’t know how many of them there are”<br>“Listen, the only way we are going to escape this hell is if we work together…”<br>“There is no escape man, how many…”<br>“Every man is worth saving. I thought you of all people would understand that by now”<br> “But what if I get trapped there too”<br>“Me and you both know that they aren’t the problem”<br>“What if…”<br>“Why did you even ask me if you want to question my answer”.</em> Max cringed; the scar across his forearm grew hot, reminding him of his deeds. He was a shallow worm, constantly outcasted for his erratic behaviour. He hoarded, stole, murdered, all out of self-preservation for his own hollow husk. And then he met Glen. Max sighed, clearing his mind of the dark clouds that had been forming while he revaluated his past. <br><em>“I’ll do it, but I might not make it back in time”<br>“Don’t worry, I’ll hold those gates until you get back. And you WILL get back. Now hurry up, you’re giving me a heartache”.</em> Max looked from the town to the building, then to the sun, then with a deep breath headed toward the banshees plea.</p><p>Max knew the problem as soon as he heard the cries, but a solution he had to mull over on his way. The sun was sinking fast, and it would take awhile to help the poor sod on the roof. The man had seen Max coming and had ceased his pleas. Max could just see the upper part of his body; he seemed to be sitting cross-legged on the roof watching him. Max was close enough to make out the structure. It was a fairly large building, half of it obliterated and swallowed by the sand, but the left side was intact. Dirty and badly weathered, but intact. He was very close now, less then half a kilometre. The thought occurred to Max that if he left the man here the man could simply jump off the roof. All he would suffer from was a broken leg. But a broken leg in the desert at this time was an almost sheer death sentence. He called up to the man,<br>“How many?<br>“Four.<br>“Only four?”<br>“Two too many for me.” The man chuckled, he seemed a lot calmer then before. He was wearing a shabby trench coat with hundreds of pockets stitched into it, and each pocket seemed to bulge from its contents. He was older then Max, but like all who walk this degrading world, he was a mess of blisters and scars, and his age had been drained away. The man had a mangy beard, and a mess of strawy hair sprouted out of his misshapen scalp in a mohawk. He grinned brightly, through a jaw of many missing teeth. He had several cigarettes clenched in between his black gums. Max watched in astonishment as he sucked the fags back to his fingers, then cast them over his shoulder and pull more of the rare commodities out of his pockets.<br>“I’ve got no real weapon to kill them, but I figure I can run in and ram them, then we get the fuck out! Time is short and we gotta move fast!”. Max shouted gesturing to the sun.<br>“Then lets get this done quickly”, he replied through two more drags. Max jogged around to the back of the building. There stood the door, it had been scorched, like everything else in this land, and now was being swallowed up by the sand. It seemed the man on the roof had spent a great deal of time digging away at the earth, clearing a passage into this place, but even now the sand was piling inward, swallowing the door up once again. He began digging the door back out the lands grasp. When there was enough space for him to squeeze through into the building he did. The first thing he noticed was the lack of oxygen, he gasped for breath immediately. The next was the heat; he felt his blood boiling, his energy seeping out of his body through the sweat dribbling down his chest. Motion caught his attention before he could focus on the ruins interior, struggling in the corner, pants and grunts echoed around the room. There was four netherbeings, undead humans who had been turned by the moon and sand into ageless monsters. Their meat was shrivelled to their bones like fleshy scarecrows, and they grunted and panted through rotting teeth, groping with their gnarled arms at the trapped man. He was swatting their outstretched hands away with his fists, but the netherbeings were getting closer and closer to grabbing hold of him. Max choked in a deep breath, and then charged the monsters, tackling all four to the ground. The man jumped over Max, then grabbed his shoulders and pulled him out of the grasp of the confused and enraged beasts. They ran side by side to the exit, not looking back at the four netherbeings that they could hear perusing. They reached the door together and slammed into it in unison. The sand on the other side had already made progress at filling in the wound Max had dug into the earth, and there was barely enough room for one of them to squeeze through. Max slid through first; an uncomfortable fit being squeezed in between the door the wall and the man pushing desperately against him. Max popped out of the other end and fell face first into the sand. He quickly recovered and turned to help the other man out.<br>“I’m stuck”, the man cried, his eyes pleading Max for help. Max grabbed the man’s arm, which was desperately trying to push the door wider, and with all his might pulled. The man’s body slid slowly through the gap. He screamed wildly in pain, and his voice elevated when his arm popped out of its socket. Max felt a tinge of pleasure at the man’s cries, his screams echoing around inside Max’s head, his bad thoughts beckoned him to twist the man, make him suffer, to indulge on his pain. Max shoved these troubling thoughts back into the pit they had crawled up from and dropped the man’s arm. It sagged uselessly from the man’s body. His screams of pain had changed to screams of fear, as the man beat the netherbeings on the inside of the building back.<br><em>“GLEN! GLEN!”<br>“WHAT!?”<br>“THE DOOR, MANS STUCK, NETHERBEINGS!”<br>“WHAT? WHAT’S GOING ON?”<br>“THE MAN, HES STUCK IN BETWEEN THE DOOR, DOESN’T FIT THROUGH, SAND PUSHING AGAINST DOOR!”<br>“DIG”.</em> Glen’s order shot from Max’s heart, through his blood it flew, straight to his brain. Max jumped down to his hands and knees and slashed at the sand, ripping chunks of it away from the door. The door budged outward bit by bit until the man flew out from between his constraint. The netherbeings attempted to follow but Max slammed the door shut. The sand immediately began filling in, burying both the door and Max’s ebony black boots.</p>

                <p>Edit. Edit. Edit. Change and tickle the tormented twist of imperfection, oh how it burns and burns and burns. A single smile splits across my face as wide eyes stare out with glee at what I can only consider to be adequate. Words stacking and clicking and clacking, all into order. My order, my design, my little wall. I present it now, after quite a bit of changing and twiddling and tossing and fiddling. I'm quite farther than this, about 200 pages in. Work picks up and school slashes it's claws, but the warmth calls and I obey...</p><p>I live to serve...</p><p><em><strong>Chapter 1</strong></em></p><p><em>It wasn't the scalding pain of his skin peeling away that woke him. Neither was it the water saturating through his scorched flesh into the hungry heat. It was the petrifying fear of being torn out of his physical body - shot through eternal darkness, hearing his partner’s own scream melding with his own into a single demented tone, then splitting off into two then three then four of the same screams from the same terrorized soul all spiraling through the darkness. And then he was awake, upright in the blazing heat. His eyes met his partner’s immediately. They were a calming light blue, and had the glint of intelligence that was absent in the eyes of most nowadays. His partner’s hair was longer than most too; it drooped down to his shoulders, and was matted with enough dirt and grime so that it had a greasy gleam to it. His partner was fairly short in this world despite his elder age, standing at only six feet tall, and two feet wide. The hellish atmosphere had blistered his skin, twisting it into a hardened shell striped with scars from previous torments, transforming him and everyone else into ageless wretches. Their skin was slathered with layers upon layers of grotesque flesh, added to strew the damages to their bodies from the previous deaths back into use. Eventually those layers grew thick and heavy, adding weight and muscle to the tormented souls trapped within. Adding a splash of colour to the ageless wretches skin suits were hundreds of small tattoo’s marking their past lives and accomplishments; never buried beneath the new-formed flesh, they glistened across the freaks bodies unscathed where skin and bone had been broken and rebuilt. The freshly arisen flesh that had been baking and boiling in the blasting heat looked his partner over. He was standing over him wearing a common wretch garb; a heavy duster coat overtop another heavy rubbish-stained shirt, with faded blue jeans; all apparel cut and torn. Atop his greasy mop was a brown wide brimmed hat, tilted foreword to keep the sun's ruthless javelins from piercing his eyes. His left arm was outstretched to the freshly arisen flesh, the hand held out bearing a peculiar scar that stretched across his palm. A scar which both the long-haired partner and the freshly arisen shared, it was the mark of their union, the brand of the blood pact that they had formed. They smiled at each other in unison, then the freshly arisen flesh wrapped his own scarred hand around his partners, who pulled him onto his feet. The freshly arisen flesh towered over his long-haired partner, standing four feet taller and three feet wider.<br>“Remember anything from last time?” asked his long-haired partner.<br>“Mn. I remember Kris, and having my head torn off. And Jude…”. The freshly arisen flesh fingered the pink meat around his neck that was now browning in the heat. The long haired partner chuckled, the freshly arisen flesh scowled. “You should of let me kill him, I had him in my hands. All I had to do was squeeze.”<br>“Nothing we can do now, so don’t fret about it”.<br>The long haired partner scanned their surroundings, taking in the identical view of a “town” they awoke in after every reincarnation. They were “protected” by huge walls of junk, protruding up from the rubble they stood on. The rubble was a mosaic of the remnants of obliteration; grains of stone and cement and glass mixed with steel shavings and sawdust and much more unidentifiable solids stacked upon each other made up the rough ground. The walls were composed of a much less annihilated assortment of broken objects; odd metal compartments such as car parts, toasters, microwaves, and televisions stretched from left to right in a perfect single kilometre before hitting the other, with only one entrance and escape amongst the four of them. A large gate stood on the eastern wall, just wide enough for four freaks to fit through simultaneously. The gate faced where the sun rose in the sky every morning, as well as the moon that replaced it at night. The long haired partner fixed his eyes on the small simple well that was in the direct center of the town. It had a little wooden roof to keep out the sun, and a bucket and crane attached by a coil of rope; but most importantly it housed water. Water was the most important resource known to the living; it provided for the foundations of life and solved almost all the problems that arose during the light of day. However, one could only retrieve a pail of water once a day, the pail simply refused to function for those who had already taken their ration under the same sun. A single silhouette sat near the well, watching the freshly awoken duo. “C’mon Max”, urged the long haired partner with a grin, “let’s get started”. The long haired partner started walking toward the well and the silhouette beside it, and Max followed in his shadow. Along the way they stepped over a plethora of empty shells that would soon be filled with life. As life dove into these husks, shrieks shot out; and the town was filled with the screams and cries of the waking. Hundreds of bodies were scattered across the town, springing to life and bellowing at the horrors of not having it for a moment. By the time Max and his long haired partner had reached the well, many others were approaching. When they arrived at the well a bulky thing propped up against a battered plastic shield greeted them with a frown. Even sitting, he was taller than the long haired partner. He was roughly eleven feet standing and four feet in width, his browned skin clad tight behind his unique black armour. The bulky thing wore a black metal helmet with a tinted plastic visor that matched his black armor, all the equipment proclaiming in a faded white paint: “ANTI-RIOT”. Max had never seen equipment like it before, and he had a curious thought as to how the thing had come to own such a set of defence. The shield bearer’s eyes were hidden from behind the tinted visor, but his expression from the exposed frown was clear.<br></em></p>

                <p><em>“How’d you get that”, he demanded, his voice rich with hostility and his finger stabbing out toward the sinful tattoo on Max’s left wrist. The tattoo was of a small shack on fire, which symbolized being cast out of the community in many lives; a brand conjured by those of violent and destructive deviance. Max felt a choking shame swell up to his throat at the demand. The long haired partner intercepted, pulling his hat off and bowing to the bulky man.<br>“Don’t mind that, sin’s can never be forgotten, and his sins stain his flesh. I tell you though, his soul is as clean as well-water. His names Max, and I’m Glen”. Glen winked and put his hat back on, a friendly smile spread across his cracked lips. The shield bearer grunted and scanned Glen from behind his visor, his eye’s hungrily searching for any exposed tattoo that could give some clue as to the nature of Glen’s character. The duster coat covered his entire body and not a single tattoo was visible from the outside.<br>“Marcus”, he responded before standing to tower over Glen. He leaned down to see eye to eye, and Max bristled and balled his fists. Glen kept his posture and stared deep into the visor, his light eye’s reflecting off the tint. The standoff lasted only several seconds, then Glen took a step back.<br>“Holy hell is it hot today, nice to meet you Marcus; I’d love to talk but I’m just parched”, he declared, and walked over to the well where two more freaks were watching. Marcus sneered victoriously after Glen, and Max twitched in mute rage. The shield bearer had been sizing them up, pushing their buttons to see how they would respond. Max skulked off with Glen to the side of the well. Glen was pulling the pail up with the rope, and the sound of water juttering around in the pail calmed his being. There was no sound more refreshing than the whooshing of water. Glen pulled the pail up and held the decrepit wooden bucket to his lips. He took his time drinking the water back, enjoying the rejuvenating liquid as it sank into his scalding body. Glen offered the empty bucket to Max who proceeded to fill it with his own share. When Max had the pail filled and in his hands, there was a crowd gathered around him, all waiting for their turn to fill their broken bodies with life. He sucked the water back, spilling it down his neck as he tried forcing all of it down his aching throat at once. When he had finished he dropped the pail back into the well and the rope was immediately snatched by someone else. Glen was talking to a man in the crowd, and Max assumed his position behind him, uninterested in the conversation. The water that had spilled down his body had already been gobbled up by the heat, and the moment of serenity that had been provided returned to the discomfort of being fried. The crowd grew and grew as more awoke from their lifelessness with the thirst for their first taste of life. Glen moved from person to person, mingling among the freaks of the new found town who appeared to be alive enough to converse with. Max stayed behind him, skulking moodily. Max looked to where Marcus had been standing to find him still their, poking and prodding another wretch. Glen turned and looked back for Max, and when he saw him where he usually was he flashed a smile and continued mingling throughout the crowd. Max was soon drowning in the town’s unusually large populace. Previous incarnations usually had just around a hundred citizens, but it seemed that there were much more freaks than that flooding towards the well. Their skin tone varied between a usual burnt black and bleached white and broiled brown, and there was a common quietness for the amount of people around. Among the hundreds that were gathering, most stood in silence, staring foreword with blank eyes and a thoughtless expression. Some mouths were agape, other’s eyes never blinked; some shambled around without rhyme or reason, and an odd few moaned muttered and mumbled excessively. Their only thoughts were of water, and when their satisfaction was met; their heads turned off. These were the common folk of this desert wasteland. Thoughtless freaks with little self-awareness, whose souls had gone senile from endless crushed aspirations; which led to the nullification of any at all. They lived without want, and they died without (much) care. Among them however were the fresh meat, those that were young to the circle of death, who had yet to be crushed or corrupted by the desolate wasteland and the things that inhabit it. They were smaller and cleaner than most, their bodies not yet twisted by endless deaths or painted by unnumbered tattoos. They were quiet and cautious and small in number, for it was not often that another fiend would join the world, nor was it easy for the new inhabitants to adjust. Most who were clever enough or wise enough to know how and what and why hoarded their knowledge in order to maintain an edge over their competition; and those that spouted fountains of knowledge spawned sour and unsatisfactory pools. Glen turned to Max, “Lift me up onto your shoulders, I need to get everyone’s attention”. Max picked him up by the armpits and did as he was bid. Max was two feet taller than most of the freaks around him, who averaged out around eight feet tall. Glen was a little man, but he had a booming voice trapped deep within his lungs, and that voice bellowed “Awake and well I see”. Only a few faces peered his way. Glen wracked Max’s noggin with his knuckles, and Max roared, “LISTEN UP”. The shout cracked through the air and made quite a few more people look up at Glen, still less than half the faces in the crowd were at attention.<br>“Awake and well I see", Glen repeated, "the name is Glen and my brand is ‘Noble Soul’. My man Max is the big guy below me right now, say ‘hi’ Max.” Max said nothing. Glen chuckled merrily to himself and continued, “This town will go far if we come together and keep each other alive. It seems we have a rather unique overpopulation here, so lets keep this in mind as a sign. I’d ask all who strive for a permanent residence to get acquainted here and now, by stating their name and brand. That is if it pleases them, of course.” Glen was referring to the string of black words etched into the back of every freaks neck. The words were less of a statement about the person, and more of a form of identification, for broken bodies changed appearances quickly and names were as solid as well water. The words were unique to the individual. Marcus sprung up in an instant, eager to implant his name and brand upon the town.</em></p>

                <p><em>“I AM MARCUS”, he bellowed in an ear-popping roar, “AND MY BRAND IS ‘THE MAN’. I WIELD THIS SHIELD TO SLAM AND SMITE IN THE NAME OF THE CROW”. Marcus then swiveled about to search through the crowd for someone to challenge his pronounced testimony. No one in the crowd opposed him, and Marcus settled his gaze on Glen. A moment of silence went by as no one else stepped foreword to introduce themselves. After a short time of silent anticipation, another freak; whose freshness was apparent from his small size and lack of malformed meat; shouted out his name and brand.<br>“I’m Scab and my brand is ‘Observer’”. Another yelped out their name and brand from deep within the crowd, then another. Max could feel the swell of enthusiasm rising in Glen’s body, and pain filled him. Max took the twinge of pain and locked it in a box, then threw the box into the pit where he locked away all his bad thoughts and feelings. The calls of the freaks introducing themselves continued, but Max did not hear. His mind was uninterested with the introduction ceremony that Glen started at the beginning of every incarnation. His thoughts were in a lull, his mind still slumbering. It would take time for his gears to start spinning out a more lively Max, for his head had been torn from his shoulders and was still getting re-acquainted with the rest of his body. His eyes drifted out into the crowd, taking in none of the mirror empty expressions that reflected back at him. His eyes stopped and fixed in on a rotten sight that disturbed his thoughtlessness. The smallest, palest, and frailest creature he had ever seen had just nudged its way into Max’s line of sight. Its arms were hidden behind its poncho, with only its tight jean leggings showing off its bone thin limbs at the ankles. it wore no shoes, and its feet were almost skeletal. None of this was notice worthy of Max, freaks and wretches came in all different shapes and sizes. What disturbed Max was the thick clay mask that the frail freak wore on his face. It was of a faded rustic colour, with a speckled splash of dried blood sprinkled across, and two swirls spiraling out from where the eyeholes should be. It had no holes for seeing or breathing, nor did it have a string or band wrapped around it. The confusion of how the frail freak was able to keep the mask on and direct himself into a clear line of sight of Glen made Max’s put a question into Max's head. The gears budged, a single click, a disturbance in the numb unmoving coils of Max's thought process. The swirls centered in on him and Glen, and Max felt a thought creep from within it’s pit. The mask shook, and a voice radiated out through it.<br>“I am Saint Francis, and my brand is just that. This new town already has such wonderful children, and this man Glen seems to have already been planning this town’s prosperity in his mind.” Francis held his right hand out towards Glen, “I pledge my use to you and this town, come see me after you are finished here and we can discuss a foundation to settle upon.” Marcus immediately bristled and shouted, “You two aren’t gunna leave me out! I’m gunna be a part of the top crew, the shield shows my strength!” The enthusiasm inside Glen exploded into pure joy, and Max felt another scratch in the pit. Many more freaks spat out their names and brands, and when the crowd went silent for a whole minute Glen gave his commands.<br>“Everyone who has the brains left to understand me, go out and find the stash outside. Anyone with a strong instinct for the desert should go out into the deeper regions and bring back some rarities. We need to start mapping the desert, and that means getting a tower built today. After the tower will come a storage to house our more precious recourses, then living quarters. If anyone has skills in craftsmanship, or knowledge of architecture, meet me in an hour at the well.” Glen’s words ended and silence followed for several seconds. Glen pulled off his hat and scratched his head, then shouted, “What are you waiting for? You’re wasting sunlight!” With those words, many wretches started departing, and Max felt the swell of Glen’s enthusiasm bulge further. Another scrape of something creeping up the pit. Glen tapped Max’s forehead to get catch his attention, and when Max looked up he ordered, “Go out and find me some valuables out there. I have a real good feeling about this town. Don’t let me down.” Max helped Glen dismount, then followed the crowd toward the gate. When he looked back, Glen was engaged with several freaks; two of them being Saint Francis and Marcus. The genuine smile on Glen’s face was disgusting. Far above Max flew a bird, too high to spy, but through its eyes it watched the same smile with simialer disgust.<br></em></p>
