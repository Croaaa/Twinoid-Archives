                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://twd.io/e/FOsg0g">Here</a> is the thread for all your questions.</p><p>I sent the smoke signals and the smoke signals talked back.</p><p><strong>Community Question Time:</strong></p><br><p><em>A- can we pull a Poisoned Water Ration from the Well?</em></p><br><p>Epoq - No. That would be a negative. Not possible. No way. No how. Never. No. Erm... No.<br><em><br>B- There are a few 'bugs' (not sure if they'd be defined as bugs or not.) but there's an alignment issue when you click on an application in the directory (example!), the "This user doesn't their account linked to twinoid" message when trying to access someone's soul when they're deadified and when trying to view the soul points amassed by season it displays your total SP as opposed to the season's SP, I'm sure there are other little nitty things which could do with being fixed but I doubt Epoq really wanted this to turn into a pointing out every little thing which could be fixed thread.</em></p><p>Epoq - Not really a question this... but I've passed them along anyways as minor issues.</p><br><p><em>C- <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico">Does home defense get taken into account when determining LMS?<br><img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_middot.gif" alt=":hordes_*:" class="tid_ico">Is the horde's attack calculated on a zed-by-zed basis? In other words, zed A attacks citizen 3, then zed B attacks citizen 19, then zed C attacks citizen 3, then...</em></p><p>Epoq - Each citizen is allocated their "share" of the zombies who manage to breach the defences, their home defenses are used to "occupy" a certain number of zombies, and the probability of dying/injuries/terror is worked out on the remaining zeds.</p><br><p><em>D- can he explain how this LMS was awarded? / ok after some detective work, it seems that nckid4u has been awarded 3 LMS but only has 2 distinctions which leads me to believe this was just a display error.</em></p><p>Epoq - If you die during the day (from poisoning, dehydration during an expedition, ...): the day does not count as having been "lived in full". For example, if you die from Cyanide poisoning during your 14th day in town, you will only be awarded points for the 13 full days you survived. Does this answer the question. (?)</p><br><p><em>E- Will the 'messages' distinction ever be fixed?</em></p><p>Workshop - It's not exactly broken as such. It has been removed since the Twinoid merge. I have not received a reply as to whether they would be re-introduced but the message was passed on to the devs.</p>

                <p>i really hope you fix the messages, not only for myself (wich i think i'd have around some dozens of thousands by now) but also to detect and identify the active players. and i have a question of my own if i'm alowed to ask aswell, will you be introducing new items for christmas, 21/12/12 (since it's the end of the world and all) or for any other special day soon? maybe for valentine that would be interesting ;D</p>
