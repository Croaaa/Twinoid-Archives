                <p>All building houses (let's pretend there in no other defences). House gives 4 defence for town per person = 160 defence. Then 10 personal defence. It means if attack is 171 and enough bad luck for that 11 zombies overflow to attack against one person, he is dead.</p><p>So in theory defences it gives for town to prevent deaths is 170. But that also means terrorized people, and without enough cures for it, it decreases scavenging as even one zed zone causes problems, and also affect negatively on watch. And their writings on forums are much more harder to understand.</p>

                <p>you are right to not support the house idea. but here are the more important reasons, i wouldÂ´t pay attention to math concerning this subject because strategically there are deeper ways to think about how to manage AP and when:</p><ul><li>this game is based on gathering resources , no one can find and collect and bring back those resources from planks, Iron, N&amp;B, EC, Pipes and other important things without daily scavenging in big numbers. so going out to scavenge in first 5 days is increasing the chances for successful long towns. staying inside in big numbers in early days to convert and upgrade houses blocks both scavenging and resources needed for key projects which are a must build like Pump, Workshop, Factory, Drilling Rig, Study, and many others.</li><li>the map in first 3 to 5 days is always low on zombie numbers which allows for free safe scavenging and finding weapons to kill zeds in short ranges. if the majority stay inside and build or just stick to 6 AP range in first 3 to 5 days, there will be less resources in bank to build or upgrade and it will allow the zeds to spread much much faster if no one is killing them. thus making it nearly impossible to go scavenge in later days due to lack of weapons and too many zeds.</li><li>house upgrades are mainly only profitable if its only Tent. hovel to house is not a good AP investment unless it is done later like after day 10 or if both projects "Fortifications + Community Involvement" are built. otherwise any defensive project in construction site is better than house upgrades mainly because the AP is badly needed elsewhere early.</li><li>also remember if someone dies , the 40% of their home defense will be lost. but if their home upgrade AP were put in construction site, they remain after their untimely death.</li></ul><p>Advice:<br>the best way to have success and last long in a town is to scavenge early first 5 days for long times staying outside in replenished zones daily (autosearching) and killing zeds inside 9 AP range. anything except that is playing to aim for LMS and a quick dead town.</p>
