                <p>GG. I killed as a ghoul from day 2 to 6 until eventually too little people left to hide. At least I got 5 days. If anyone has any questions ask and I made this thread cause forums are kinda dead unlike mush who have after party threads.</p><p>I spared the guy who killed me in the end tho LOL as I went for the tamer who was harder to get to but I believed my 2 "followers" who thought I was good wouldn't attack me hahahaha. Too bad I can't run for LMS but good job <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico">. I should have ate you then huh? Or would I have still died in the end? Should I have "Camped" a building for a BP but then live? Idk how I could have played that better. Only 9 people other than me and 2 were attacked already. . . . .</p><p>Day 2-3 I realized that a hero alliance was forming and I had to do something. On day 3 SORRY sabrina I killed you :/ but your partner Loowan was randomly attacking and I couldn't let anyone interfere. Then I saw Black name guy saying people should upload pictures of their status bar..... too bad he suicided lol. Was there actually a 5 coaltion of heros and that's why you guys never attacked one another as heros???</p><p>Oh and special mentions to the Chris-Dude as he was pretty funny. Eating someone in town ummm huh?!?!?!? I wouldn't have hit him if he was recorded as the ghoul but I couldn't risk anyone hitting me to find who ate the person. (The logs said a ghoul but not who). I still don't know how I could have played this better.</p><p>That also brings me to my next point. You guys gave Chris all the credit for killings on day 2-5 I was so pissed but I didn't want to blow my cover. I think he turned on the day I killed him (0 full days as ghoul? Idk?) I calculated every step as much as possible. Only hiccup was the tamer I ate already boozed.... had to get hooked to get back.</p><p>P.S. If someone is always online after a ghoul attack ~2 hours they are usually the ghoul. . . . especially since I didn't log names down as why catch myself <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p>
