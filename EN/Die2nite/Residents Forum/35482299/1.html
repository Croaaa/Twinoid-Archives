                <p>My how time flies...<br>I heard about the game from a brief mention in a podcast on the now defunct Spill.com. It was fairly (I think) early in Season one. The description was vague but it interested me enough to check out the site.<br>I signed up and joined my first town (Dam of the ancient arts), about an hour before ARG!. Read a few things, clicked a bunch of buttons, checked out the forums and then decided to go out and search the wastes. That's how I found out that I was <em>supposed</em> to be on the inside when the zeds attack. I didn't even live an hour in my first town.<br>Don't remember much from the next town, lived only two days, but the comment on my Soul Page says "2nd town, 2nd stupid death". It couldn't have been good but by that point I was already getting addicted. During that first Season I went on to live twenty 23 days in one town and over the course of eight towns I accumulated 781 Soul Points. <br>I got really lucky and met a few helpful Beta players in that time. They gave me lots of help getting started. <span class="tid_user tid_user_1852746 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1852746">Talenos</span>'s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlBmAKf7sc8">Odd Park Vid-cast</a> was also very helpful to me. When he did the live show I asked for tips and he suggested that I find some good players and start a coal. I took his advice and ended up playing with that group for the next several seasons.<br>Lots of good memories but that first stupid death will always stick in my mind.</p>

I remember winning LMS and thinking, wow I can post in the World Forums! <br>Then one town I met a dude named WalkinCrow, and I had seen him post in World Forums. He convinced me that IRC chat wasnt a virus and I saw how people played and it was really cool! <br>Then Twinoid came! <br>Tetsab invited me to my first meta town <img src="http://mush.twinoid.com/img/icons/ui/lp.png" alt=":mush_hp:" class="tid_ico"><br>Wow I just looked through all my random and small season one and two towns and I only in all that see two people I know!

                <p>Beta ended end of November 2010, so alittle late on the 3 year birthday, but with how Motion-Twin handle updates around here, its a fittng homage to celebrate it late <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>Read about the game on NeoGaf so tried it out, 1st town didn't last long. last day and 3 left, I went outside and got stuck, who knew terror took your control points, embarrassed by my own fail, I became a hero so I could HR back and the rest is history. Eventually I went on to be the first to both the Scavanger and Survivalist 300 day titles.</p><p>2nd town somehow lasted 15 days and ran through xmas 2010, about 15-20 of us joined together to do a town in the new year. Half were a bunch of cool Polish guys who slowly stopped playing but I also met Dainz, Duckman and Alphabet who I would play many seasons with.</p><p>Also met Andaho in that town who was the original creator of die2nite.net and he set up a chat room for our expeditions, which eventually became open to all and so busy it was moved onto the quakenet irc and became what it is now. He didn't last long as he was farming infected distinctions but also because of him I would later meet Annette/Scout but I'm skipping ahead now <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></p><p>So we jumped after the new year and was followed by another half coalition led by a guy called Hoffenpepper, he had seen me arguing with an old school meta called The Crows, who had I think the longest beta town that you didn't *need* to upgrade Watchtower and could cope without it (this was back when maps were 15x15. Still, no WT upgrades was a bad idea ha) So in that town we didn't upgrade it and were the first town to reach 25 days, until Odd Park beat us, we also survived longer then the Crows who jumped at the same time, so that was pretty rewarding.</p><p>One of Hoffenpeppers crew was Virg who is here in the same town as me right now and I've played with him from Season 0-8. After that town we combined into a full meta and headed into season 1.</p><p>Originally I only wanted to point out that beta was 2010 and was on my way to sleep, but then I started to write and it turned into a eulogy of sorts. I don't really play much now and am an old man in D2N terms, not many towns left in me, but I'll continue this story tomorrow.. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/smile.png" alt=":sq_smile:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p>Very nice thread Aivaras.</p><p>Those are some great stories, especially thrilled to read yours: E-Ninja and Joanne (hilarious with the IRC), since I so much enjoy playing with you but never knew about some of the info shared in here.</p><br><br><p>I mostly post to revive this thread, hoping that someone else will write something, only very short personal info to stay on topic:</p><p>I found this game soon after beta, still in Season 0, started to gather friendly and like-minded players since the very first town, to eventually establish a team known as Royal Flying Mowers. Proud to name more than several members as my friends, some of them I know for 3 years and 3 months already.<br>Recently trying to guest in other teams or jump into random towns whenever I`m inbetween of RFM jumps, to have some rest from time to time but also to meet as many players as possible and play with everyone at some point hopefully.</p>

                <p>For the first time I heard about the game at one forum and since I love zombie games/movies, I gave it a shot. It was in season 3 I guess and I think I ended up like most of the players - I went outside, got trapped, injured and died in the world beyond...</p><p>I played few random towns and got little familiar with the game, but never met anyone experienced enough, so I was starting to loose the interest in the game. But in season 6 I wrote on World forum that I look for some coa/meta and I got invite to MMJ, which was great. Than <span class="tid_user tid_user_1268289 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1268289">iDare</span> invited me to RFM town, I did some screwups, but learned from it (and from iDare's bitching :-)), promised to behave better next time, purchased Hero days and since than I play with RFM and I love the game more and more. So, thanks iDare <img src="../../../../gfx/icons/r_wintop.gif" alt=":hordes_wintop_1:" class="tid_ico">.</p>

                <p>I joined back in season 0 by playing the kado kado games I thought free amazon dollars sure I'll play If I stopped unlocking games I may get some dollars one day too <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> well any way it had the link to die2nite. Zombies I thought this might be fun. Well at the time I had a job that had me working every hour the sun was up and this was and for me the sun went down after the attack.<br>I was at least a new player that would go outside. But often would not come back inside <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"> This went on for awhile. gathered a good number of nights in the desert too</p><p>Season 1 really started to gain interest still had no clue what I was doing got lucky and jumped into a meta town asso was the leader I do believe. He was very kind and taught me a lot but I was still a bonehead I believe I built the catapult which sparked him talking to me. Then I went outside and misclicked my water and built a water-balloon. Asked for help asso brought me a new ration dropped only to come on later to find someone really went thru my zone and picked the water up and went back to town with it. I had already been saved once that town I guess that was enough times for a catapult building misclicking bonehead and another night in the desert.</p><p>So I fumbled thru a good number of towns still but at this point I had learned If I say build this Please and Thank You often it got built. So I kept doing that town after town. By that point I thought getting stuck and flee only to die of a infection was a cool thing I mean you get a gold distinction! So yea I have a good number of deaths by infection <span class="tid_wspoil">Still a secret love of mine <img src="../../../../gfx/square/razz.png" alt=":P" class="tid_ico"></span></p><p>Season 2 rolled around I jump into another one of those meta towns keep in mind at this time metas where capped at 20 people It was the Wet Cave of Murders wet it was not I was still doing my build this Please and Thank You only to have a guy named Bram follow behind me saying something too I thought oh I must be doing something wrong even though I think most the time he agreed with me. He then adopted me too The story is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuSnHqY3bl0&amp;list=PLED31EE5D107BA601">here</a> as told by CrossKnights.</p><p>As I said Bram adopted me and I Joined the Oozing Inn which Is where I have been since then had a falling out once over a house issue don't really want to get into that but I will say I really suggested building houses before houses was cool This was season 3 I left for only a short time to go and learn how to be camping pro which I am!!</p><p>Went back to the Inn in Season 4 after a little bit of begging and now Just try to make me leave my greatest friends in the world I love these guys!!!!</p>

I texted r3dd3r and told him I may not make it back to town, no computer access...unless I traveled down a long hall and sat on the floor of a public bathroom, in my backless hosp. gown.</p><p>So the convo was....</p><p>Me: I may not make it back to town (hoping he would log on under my name and help me, which I didn't know was taboo)</p><p>r3dd3r: I am a oracle, I can't help you.

                <p>I was king on Utopia, when a province member came with a shitty link to join him as pupil for MyBrute, i did, even enjoyed the total randomness of it for way too long, one day i got a bit tired of it, and we didnt have a war on utopia, so i clicked the link to dini-rpg, that was an add on MyBrute, i enjoyed that game, then one day in Mibbit chat, i saw my clanmembers talk about die2nite...i didnt immediately rush over, but seeing as they got more and more excited over it, i decided after a week to check it out, mind you i was a 24-7 play Utopia guy ...</p><p>slowly i discovered the nice game D2N, i started out midway season 1 as a newb, i read and learned, bought hero days, and i think it was end of season 3 that i found myself in a town with a couple top 30 ppl: amongst them were Fodgy and iDare...apparently i at least impressed idare (that was a town where i killed like 20+ with one fat cat), cos he invited me to Laggy chat and asked if i would guestjoin a town of RFM, by that time i already traded Utopia, which i played for like almost 5-7 years for D2N and well ...<br>right now im typing the edited version of my D2N memoires</p><p>(to be continued...i guess)<img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":tid_lol:" class="tid_ico"></p>
