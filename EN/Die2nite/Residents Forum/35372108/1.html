Do you see the zombie in the background to the left, with one arm, can you tell us how he lost his arm, something creative! <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"></cite>Yes I can see, he looks looks really very very chinese, I mean communist, because of the star that I imagine to be red but being color blind doesn't really help me out that much, if not at all really. Maybe he is she because of asian have no or small breastes, just like dwarfes have all beards and sex doesn't matter.<br>Because hair is hot on flame, I suggest the arm was lost from throwing molotov's and was holding when anti commie shot while in hand so explain why head burning and arm blew off, somehow this makes sense to me when I draw my envisage that way.<br>It was the other one on the other side with the neck bomb, he shot the molotov in the commie bitches hand.<br>Zombie war when all living dead, zombie fight each other amongst themselves for political rights and freedoms to advance their religion opinions.</p>

                <p><cite>33. In your real life do you prepare for the apocalypse, stash stuff away? Preppers style!</cite><br>Well I really shouldn't be letting people know how much impoverished or non-perishable food that I have like canned food and ramen noodles, because otherwise I will probably have to cope with a mob of raiders. But really I downloaded lots of books from torrents and they help to prepare for the worst, which is anything really basically. But unfortunately my machete got confiscated so I don't have much for weaponry, only just some tools like hammer, screwdriver, that's it about really. Maybe I can use my porn collection as for a distraction?? The only flammable I have is some spray paint that no one knows I have yet, it's better if it stays that way but I nearly got caught sometimes. I have a first aid kit and fire extinguisher but it's only a small hand sized one I got from a gas station. My walkie talkie is the closest I can get a radio. I have sake but thats for me to drink only, no other purposes under any circumstances. I have a bike for travel so I can't migrate without leaving cargo behind, this is my flaw so maybe I should save up for RV but it will only draw attract unnecessary and unwanted attention. I have a map but it isn't your kind of a map. Those books from torrents are my best asset, unless the power goes <img src="http:../../../../gfx/square/anim.png/oups.gif" alt=":anim_oups:" class="tid_ico"></p>

                <p><em>33. In your real life do you prepare for the apocalypse, stash stuff away? Preppers style!</em></p><p>*laughs* <br>I own a digital library of survival books, including the CDC booklet and army stuff. If i ever get arrested, they will call me a potential madman^^<br>I know where the closest military installations, survival shelters and stores for all kind of stuff are. There never is less than 2 weeks-rations of food in my home; i just recently though about a faradys cage made by a friend of mine, where i may store my netbook, i posess flares, a machete and military carrying equipment, 2 tents, a can of gasoline (got no car, but you have to be able to make cocktails if the world is going down^^), batons and stuff. No firearm, as having and storing them is to expensive atm. Still looking for radio equipment.<br>I cant be a real prepper, as i dont posess land, *sigh* ^^<br>WHY?<br>As my father was in civil war :/ , he told me "Son, every day something may happen; beeing prepared doesent hurt.". And ive seen how mad people go just by having a day without electricity, so i dont consider myself mad.</p>

Having somebody active with their head screwed on that wont let personal grudges cloud their judgement of what exactly constitutes griefing vs. selfish play would benefit the community and the developers. Im sure theres plenty of people that just started the game to find themselves punched on day 1 by some idiot that ran off into the desert to die and do the same the next day in a different town to somebody else. How likely are these people to stick at a game that’s difficult to get the hang of in the first place, never mind shell out hard earned cash for hero days.</p><p>Griefer sherrifs is a fine idea.</p>

                <p><strong>23. Do you have any useful traits or skills for a real Apocalypse?</strong><br>I grew up hunting, fishing and running, deep in the Appalachian mountains. I'm an exceptionally good shot, not to brag we just couldn't waste ammo. My grandfather, having grown up in the Great Depression was very big on being able to survive off the land. He made sure I learned the skills too. Give me a pocket knife and I can live comfortably in the woods with no other supplies. I'm not just saying that, I've done it.</p>

I worked up the courage to touch its legs and abdomen many times and it really did help with my fear. Small spiders didn't bother me anymore.</p><p>One day as I was about to leave to go to work I heard a loud crash. My dog had knocked over the aquarium the spider was in. The glass shattered but somehow the tarantula was ok. I still think of what might have happened had she knocked it over when I wasn't home.</p><p>Anyway, weeks or months later when I was "petting" the tarantula's abdomen it lunged up at me and bared its fangs. Scared the @*#&amp; out of me and I mentally regressed to the point where I was before I ever got the thing.

How can you really carry a whole sackful of wrought iron when its really heavy! ?</p><p>Game characters have access to a magical space in their inventories where they can carry objects without weighing them down. Haven't you seen those game characters that can carry 10 rocket launchers and machine guns in their inventory and draw them from thin air? The problem is that this magical space is limited by the number of items you can carry, similar to how a rocket launcher uses as much space in the inventory as a small key.</p>

Just prey, and the hunter. You are the same as every one else.. no one is better than you..and no one worse. Peace, in a strange sense of way, has finally come true. No need to fight, or discuss anything.. you can do what you always wanted- just "live" your life, and you are not responsible for anything. Absolute freedom, if you want to call it so. No need to look good, no exhaustion, and no need to work..no need to rest too.. the night is young, and it is yours!</p><p>AND! looking awesomely EVIL!</p>

Once there was some big forum drama post BS going on, and it was so stupid, ppl were just trolling and then, someone was like deabiting on whether someones ( mine maybe) post should be deleted. I think it was my post. Anyways Corvus Cloud was like so calm and nice and I think edited the first post to reflect creativeness in this thread or something. ANyways it was awesome and I remember thinking oh that is so nice <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> so thanks!! it was a long time ago, but I still remember!!! <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico"> <br>Was it the crazy Soapie thread???

                <p>48. What is the longest number of days you survived in a town? who were you playing with?</p><p>this one is interesting. i survived till the 10th day in a normal town. it was with Greenbean, one of the most active players and the most helpful players i have played with yet. we survived on only watchmen with 900 zombies coming the day i died, i think that they are still fighting, with only 5 left and soon to be all dead, if any survivors from the fossilized gang are reading this, give a shoutout??</p>

Children are stupid. Of course just as I worked up the courage to enact this magnificent plan, the neighbor pulled up, to see me apparently trying to drop a rock on her dog. I think I got pretty harshly scolded by her. That was a seriously dumb move on my part, I must admit, but I was like 6 or something.</p><p>I have made <span class="tid_funTag tid_funTag_dice100">11</span> such boneheaded moves throughout my life.</p>

                <p><em>61. Would you go looting in a real zombie apocalypse, where would you go first?</em></p><p>I wouldn't go looting. There is nothing I need so bad that I would risk getting killed or wounded by a desperate fool. I may steal some gas for my camp stove so I'm not given away by smoke but I can steal that from lawn mowers, abandoned cars and such.<br>I would head straight to the tree line behind my house. From there I can make it to Daniel Boone National Forest without leaving the cover of trees, except for crossing some roads. I'm perfectly able to survive long term in the woods with nothing but a pocket knife. I have all the comforts too, if I have time to gather it when the stuff hits the fan, left over from my days of long distance (multi-month) hiking.<br>TL;DR - <strong>So long suckers!</strong></p>

In a heart beat.

Such an enclosure blocks external static and non-static electric fields by channeling electricity through the mesh, providing constant voltage on all sides of the enclosure. Since the difference in voltage is the measure of electrical potential, no current flows through the space. Faraday cages are named after the English scientist Michael Faraday, who invented them in 1836.</p><p>So yes, I know now, thanks to Wikipedia <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_lol.gif" alt=":D" class="tid_ico">! It would be nice to have one. Like if the family visited and I didn't want to talk to anyone, and just wanted to play Die2Nite and watch Netflix. I'd lock myself in, and wait it out. I'd make sure to have it stocked full of Coca-Cola, Goldfish [the SNACK], and air conditioning <img src="../../../../gfx/square/happy2.png" alt="^_^" class="tid_ico">.</p>
