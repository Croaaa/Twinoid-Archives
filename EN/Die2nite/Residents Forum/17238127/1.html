How terribly numb you can become when at the foot of deaths door. When one is stricken by the pain that can be avoided... <br><br>The blood dribbled down from my thankful mouth. In behind the broken white cage the small creature at the back of my mouth danced in a lustful joy, it wriggled in pleasure at the great taste of <strong>meat</strong>. The white steak that lay at my lap stopped its useless struggle and stiffened up. My eyes grew red with lust. My body throbbed with pleasure, which was sure to be short lived because this horrific <strong>sin</strong> would not go unnoticed. The rats and the cats were not missed, but the little white meat, once gone by the name of Blondie, was too relevant to the town to disappear. It's master would soon return, and it would only be a matter of time before the smudge in <strong>their</strong> society would be wiped clean through death. With maddened courage I interrupted the creatures joyous dance and removed the white meat from it's broken cage. I stood, with the blood of my sin still dripping from my monstrous mouth, and left my tattered tent. Their eyes stabbed into my soul. They all watched as I left, as I ran, a coward I live, a coward I die. For it is only a matter of time before the master is informed of her loss, and the dreadful hammers beat down in completion of my gallery. I will be exposed as the weak worm, which I know I am. And with regret far from mind, I ran.<br><br>Out in the night, I can see the <strong>fright</strong>, the eternal mass. It comes from the south, I flee to the north.<br><br>Out beyond the beyond I wait. The great wall of fear that contains the petty bastion of sanity. We are trapped in a pit with the flood of death rolling down into our doors. But <strong>beyond the wall</strong>, what lies there? I stand staring and wondering. It is clear that us ourselves are trapped here by nothing more than fear. A sudden <strong>jolt</strong> ran up my spine, I knew then that it was almost my time. The rope was tied, the structure complete. With a burst of rage, I sprinted forward, head-first, into the sludge of fear. <br><br>My body shook, and my mind bashed. My whole essence vibrated violently, I closed my burning eyes and ran farther and farther, deeper and deeper, hoping to shirk death himself by entering where even he feared. And suddenly I was afloat, no, <strong>falling</strong>. With a crumpled thud, my body ceased its self-inflicted assault. With great effort I returned to my feet. All around me lay darkness, until I realized with annoyance that my eyes were closed. I opened them to be met with a green light. It illuminated the small room, and revealed what seemed to be a mess of wires and machines. I cautiously <strong>tip-toed</strong> around, spying cases of "whirring" and wonder. Up against the wall propped a case with the label "Colt 1911 MK IV Series 80", and under read "R.I.P Gale, A Bright Young Boy Full Of Twisted Traps And Twisted Morales". I tried to open the case in curiosity, but to my disappointment It was locked. A shrill beep startled me, and I turned to meet a large monitor, the source of the green light. Across the screen spread much jiberish, a lot of [ERROR] and [DATA CORRUPT]. My eyes moved moved to the newest command, and in <strong>horror</strong> I read /Player SaucyemmettC EXPUNGED. My eyes desperately searched for a button to press, to escape. With a victorious cry I noticed a round red button at the bottom of the monitor. It wore a heavenly title, "End Process". My hand <strong>shot</strong> out but before my fingers could feel the key to my final release I felt the hard pull of metal chain links pull me from the green lights, and pull me off into...</em><br><br><span class="tid_wspoil"><em>The End</em></span></cite></p>

homes to see what happened, it seems a lot happened, as almost every citizen in town has been eaten and mauled in tonight's raid, their will only so much of us left, in fact their was four of us left, all of us losing hope at a very rapid rate, then one survivor went to the radio station and sent out a broadcast to the remaining three survivors saying, listen i know thing's look bad, but if we work together we can survive another night don't lose hope yet, because i haven't, the other three survivors agreed on staying alive, so they did what they could for the day, sinking all their strength into traps and temporary buildings for the undead, their wasn't enough survivors to find out how many were gonna attack so, the survivors hoped that it was turn out well in the end, <br><br>the next day, the gates and defenses held on the gates and the walls, when zombies got in the survivors violently beat them with logs and rocks, as the infected left to feast another night, the survivors realized that, they must evacuate the town, so every one started getting supplies and resources and decided to head out, their were only four of them left, they had one goal, to make it to the bunker, it was a long trip but they had to make it, we kept moving and pressing on, each of them had to carry a specific type of items, one carried water, one carried important supplies, one carried food and drugs, and the broadcaster carried weapons, when we got to the bunker it was swarmed with infected by infected, so the broadcaster bravely threw a explosive water bomb at the infected horde, bringing them down to one zombie, and then the broadcaster realized that last zombie was his friend during the zombie raid two day's ago, he couldn't bare to kill his friend, he gave one of the survivors a burnt out torch to kill the infected, after a few minutes of savage beating, the survivors made it into the bunker, the bunker's air was thin and the stench of dead took up most of the bunker's air, so the survivors agreed to keeping the bunker door's open till midnight, if they went with that plan one would have to be a guard, the broadcaster agreed to being the guard of the bunker<br><br>the attack was near, the survivors were ready, with the supplies they found in the bunker they were ready to repel the zombie attack if they get in, the closed the gate, and got ready, they started hearing loud clanging noises in the vents, as one survivor shouted, THEY'RE COMING IN FROM THE VENTS, so the survivors stood their ground, then the infected started coming in from different rooms of the bunker, the survivors fought bravely, the front gate was not destroyed, but one survivor was bit, and it was the broadcaster, after the attack he look at his wound with a dead look on his face, after several minutes of silence, the broadcaster stood up, put his belongings on the ground, and decided to leave, but not without making an impact, he started to strap makeshift explosives to his body, he said he was gonna clear a path to town so you will all have a chance to get supplies if needed, he walked out into the desert without another word, an hour later, an explosion was heard near the ruined town, the survivors knew he did what he had to do before he changed into one of them, <br><br>midnight, round two, it was time for the survivors to make their last stand, because they knew, the damage done on the bunker door was too great for them to survive another night, they got ready with a look of determination on their faces, ready to fight, as they expected, the bunker door broke down within minutes, they fought to the very end, at the end of it all, one survivor was left standing, he gazed at the corpses of his two comrades, and said to himself in a faint voice, i am alone, he buried the corpses of his friends in the front, and decided to end it all with a cyanide pill he found in the bunker, he took a tall glass of water, and repaired the front door as best he could, he repaired it with scrap metal, mud and wood, and even the bones of the undead, he spray painted something near the entrance saying, this place is safe, if you are looking for a safe haven, this is your place, enter the code 5503 to get in, he sat in his room, looking at his pill for several minutes, after saying to himself, no, i won't do this, their are survivors who will need help, but, what more do i have to live for in this world, he sat in his room for several hours thinking, just thinking and thinking what to do, until, he just decided to end it all, he decided to leave the bunker so his corpse wouldn't stink up the place, he stood near the entrance, closed the gate behind him, and sat down, holding a glass of water in one hand, and a cyanide pill in the other, he gazed into the wasteland, the last thing he hears is the sound of the wind, and the last thing he sees is his sign to the other survivors, he took his pill, drank the whole cup of water, and death came very quickly, as the last thing he actually saw was several shadowy figures in the distance, he thought they were survivors and he made a mistake, but at the same time, he thought they were infected, he didn't know what to think, other then it's finally over, he gave one last breath, and died,<br><br>this is the story of the last four survivors of a doomed town, this was their story</em></cite></p>

He had found me wondering around the desert, and I was only as old as you are now. So he took me to his town with him. It was called Twisted Void.<br><br>In those days the town was pretty much empty. Only 10 people lived in it. But then, they stated to arrive. They called themselves The Coalition. 30 of them ended up arriving to the town, and then it was filled up.<br><br>Your grandpa told me, as he saw them settling in, “I have a bad feeling on this one bunch of fellows…” He was, eventually, proven to be right. However, the zombies we had all fled away from were coming and defenses had to be prepared, so to start a fight with the guys from The Coalition wouldn’t have been bright.<br><br>The first days it was easy. They were organized as a sort of military, and the results were good. They explored the area, improved the walls, established systems for organized scavenging, water and food rationing, and coordinated building efforts. As days passed on, we started to notice that things weren’t all good.<br><br>While we were kept on strict rationing and almost starving, they were eating plenty of tasty food, they had free access to medicine while we struggled to get some. As they had taken control over all weapons and supplies, we couldn’t even go outside without permission. <br><br>Some people protested. Gallows were built, sturdy and tall. They did not hesitate to use them. And so there were only 38 in the town. After that, things only got worse. We were all split up in between their work groups, and there were regular patrols to make sure we hadn’t hidden anything away.<br><br>We heard speech from their leader. He talked about fighting some underground organization, but it was pretty obvious that it was just an excuse for their restrictive measures. By that time, 10 days of zombie attacks successfully repelled had passed, and yet only 35 of us remained.<br><br>Your grandpa was nervous about this, and he called me to talk in private. He showed me a pistol and told me “Son, this is a Colt 1911 MK IV Series 80. And, believe it or not, it is loaded.” <br><br>As you well know, to find a loaded gun of any kind in the desert is nearly impossible. He told me the story of this gun, how it was an inheritance of his family from long ago, and how his ancestors had been so careful with both the gun and its ammo.<br><br>As he was showing me how to give it proper maintenance, we heard a noise on the door. Then it opened, and one of the captains from the coalition, a big man with a riot shield, entered the house. “What do we got here? You know well that hoarding is not allowed.” He said, as he saw the gun. “It is just some harmless decoration” my father answered. “Well, I am taking it back!” said the captain, and he grabbed it. My father wouldn’t let go of it, and they started fighting. <br><br>In the middle of the confusion I grabbed it and it went off. The Captain was dead, with his head torn apart. Then my father started kicking his head. As I asked him what he was doing, he told me to get the gun and run back home. <br><br>They wouldn’t know what had happened, and he could take the fault. He told me that I should rob the bank and run away first thing tomorrow morning. I heard the people of The Coalition coming towards the house, so I left through a window in the back.<br><br>He was hanged later that day. Luckily, they didn’t suspect I was involved. The next morning, before dawn, I sneaked into the bank and got away with 2 water rations and a piece of the tastiest steak.<br><br>From there I walked towards a forest where I had planned to spend my first night. By the time I got there it was night already. I found a nice spot right on top of a big old tree, crawled in and went to sleep.<br><br>That morning I continued travelling. I didn’t know if The Coalition was after me, but I wanted to be sure there was a good distance between me and the town before finding a more permanent hideout.<br><br>I eventually got to a clearing in the forest, with a big rock in the middle. There I found a camp bed, and a fire that was still lit. I decided to hide nearby, and see if anyone returned to that camp.<br><br>Eventually, someone showed up. It was a man on a brown cloak, and he was carrying two baskets. Inside one of them there was a baby that was crying. He also had a hunting rifle on his back. He seemed to disregard the child entirely, and I was rather concerned. When he grabbed a knife and got the baby out of the basket, it was very clear what he was going to do.<br><br>I ran towards him with my gun and told him to stop. “Hey, first of all, this is none of your business. Second, unlike your gun, mine is loaded”, he said, and he pointed at me with his rifle.<br><br>We both stood still, waiting for the other one to back down. He started charging at me, and I shot him in the chest. As I went over to check him up, I heard him say “it really was loaded… who would have known?” Then he died.<br><br>Then I checked the baskets. One was you, son, and the other one was Blondie. He didn’t have any supplies whatsoever, and I was going to have a hard time getting by myself, but I decided to carry the two of you with me. Luckily enough for the three of us, there was a town not too far away. And a very well made one, considering we are still here after so many years. <br><br>The Crow looks after animals, kids and idiots, they say.</em></cite>

                <p><span class="tid_roleplay"><span class="tid_wroleplay">Lesson of survival.<br><br>My name is Robert Misericordia . To you, who is reading my last story, heed my words well for they might save your life. Keep other settlements near you as a friend. Do not repeat my mistakes. Let me tell you what happened in the last weeks of my life, so you will understand my lesson better.<br>It started when I was passing by this place which they called The ravaging Flippers. It was nothing like I've ever seen in my travels. Their town was filled by people who were stealing from each other whenever they got the chance. There seemed to be no teamwork except when they went outside the town to scavenge whatever they could find. I was afraid that if I tried to settle down there, I would lose all I had within days. I felt that I was better off on my own wandering around.<br>I got as much meaty bones as I could find around their gate to lure zombies away from me on my travel. Then I left this town behind me...<br>After about half a day of continuous walking and hiding from the zombies, I saw a town in the distance. My feeling of dehydration and caution left me as I ran to the town as fast as my legs could carry me.&nbsp;<br>This proved to be a grave mistake, as when I was nearing the town a zombie grabbed me from my left and pinned me down on the ground. I tried to get away but the zombie gave me an injury on my leg. As I felt the zombie winning, suddenly the zombie melted away. Before I passed out I saw 3 scouts with aqua-splashes standing behind the zombie...<br>As I awoke, I felt confused and lost. Suddenly the most beautiful girl I have ever seen came inside and asked me if I was ok. I noticed then that my injury was taken care of. So I told her I felt better then I've felt in a long time. She gave me some water and some Chinese noodles. I asked her where I was. It was a place called Den of Steel. I was given a place of my own there and quickly became one of it's citizens.<br>A few weeks went by as the zombie attacks kept growing and becoming more dangerous with every passing of the moon. We barely managed to hold them off last night. We needed a Jarpen table to give us a place to work out new constructions. We did not manage to find any at all. A scout came into town from The ravaging Flippers. He was asking us if we had some Nuts and Bolts for their town since they lacked them. I remembered hearing that we had too much Nuts and Bolts so I asked the scout if we could trade it for a Jarpen table. The scout told us that they had more tables then what they needed so he accepted. However, it was after this that I found out what the dark secret was of this town.<br>The guardians and technicians quickly grabbed the scout and killed him for his meat. Never before have I seen or even thought of the savagery these people showed towards this scout. When they saw my fear and disgust they explained to me that their town was made up of all the shunned people from The ravaging Flippers. They considered anyone from there as an enemy. After this, the entire town decided to go and steal a few tables from their enemy. The next day after we killed the 5 zombies who managed to enter our town, after killing the woman who I first saw when I had awoken, a large scale group of scouts and guardians set out to steal the tables from The ravaging Flippers. I joined them to avoid more useless bloodshed.<br>All things considered, the table hunt went well and without any casualties. When we came back to our town, what we found was horrible. Most of our citizens were hanged outside of the town's wall.<br>We ran inside our town as fast as we could. All buildings have been destroyed. Among the rubble we found only 1 survivor. It was a heavily injured tamer. He told us that a very large group from The ravaging Flippers came into town when their scout did not return. The citizens told them that they had never seen a scout and that the zombies must have made him one of their own. This lie was quickly seen through and then the Flippers started their massacre.<br>After telling us his story, the tamer died from blood loss. The group of survivors decided that they would take the Flippers down with them, since there was no hope for survival anymore. I decided to stay behind and to tell their story to whoever finds this text.<br>So, reader, as you have no learned, rivalry between towns only gives birth to death. Lack of coorporation will punish you in the end. Even now, I can hear the screams coming from the town I left behind all those weeks ago. Remember this lesson which has been taught to me through the deaths of so many. I can hear the zombies growing ever closer. There is no more hope for me, but you must survive and pass on this lesson. I wish you luck from the bottom of my heart.<br>Robert Misericordia </span></span></p>

The guardian slipped a bare fist into the Man’s gut, spatting on the Man.</p><p>“Is this what he would’ve wanted?” The guardian, logged free a Colt 1911 MK IV Series 80, the glint featured in the soggy eyes of the Man as he grunted, the only thing he saw before the handle busted the Man in the face, throwing him off his knees and into the dirt. “Eh?”</p><p>The guardian grabbed the Man by his collar, gritting his teeth in a block of rage. “I’ma kill you right here, piece of shit!” The guardian wiped salty tears from his eyes, red with madness and permanent guilt. “I ain’t cryin’ for y-you!” He whipped the barrel across the face of the Man.</p><p>The Man lost feeling, sniffing in dirt and choking it out with dry vomit spewing out, his stomach growling in restraint with absence of fluids to throw in wages and thoughts to think.</p><p>The crowd people watched, taking time away from the vegetation field with ripe, ready to harvest apples and greens. They peered through open hovel windows, others outside in the trail that acted as a road, planted firmly in the center was the mighty gibbet.</p><p>“Bring him here, I’ll wait.” The hangman said, dropping a pale veil, his ghostly eyes sticking out from within the black cloak. The guardian did so, trading the boot up the steps.</p><p>The guardian split a cough, unsteadily wiping the useless tears from his eyes, soaking his palm with water. “I trusted you! And you just....” The guardian pulled away, threatening with the Colt as he weakly positioned in deep in his holster. “Killed them? Cold-blooded snake!”</p><p>The hangman screened for the shackles that connected the murderous hands of the Man, nodding to the other guardian by the watchtower as a sign to lower the hunting rifle to the tips.</p><p>The noose slipped around the Man, the villagers watching vividly. Were they monsters all together? Killing for a killer as the devils of the sickness walked freely? Bringing one man to silence as hundreds others walked with not a nick in the air.</p><p>The hangman patted the back of the Man, whispering a blessing of the Crow. The Man stared at the angels turned devils, they were all sinned. He felt blessed suddenly, shifting his lips as the hangman cupped the lever.</p><p>“Detur mihi peccata mundi creatori, et redemptio erit post iudicium,” The Man looked to the crying guardian. “I am sorry brother.”</p><p>Then the due was granted.</p></span></div>

                <p>Ok, here goes:</p><p><strong>What is justice?</strong><br>By <span class="tid_user tid_user_1764107 tid_userBg tid_userUnknown tid_parsed" tid_bg="1" tid_id="1764107">Colette</span></p><p><em>Crime and punishment. Those two words have been closely associated for hundreds of years. It is part of the human mentality and probably one of the fruits of human rationality. The association exists since the concept of justice was born, and exemplified since the times of the Code of Hammurabi, the law of retribution: An eye for an eye. For every bad action a person makes, like thievery or murder, there should a bad consequence for him or her in return. That consequence is what we call punishment.<br><br>I had managed to get myself lost in my endless thoughts again. It is amazing how the human brain is capable of ignoring outside stimuli and focus on its own matters. The moment I lost this focus, my ears were again pierced by the shrill screams of that man. Dragged by the hair and by his tattered uniform by an angry mob. A mob formed by our fellow citizens, who were tired of him and his behavior.<br><br>The man was called Eric. He was a thin man, quite young despite what his unruly black hair and beard could suggest. A laidback, carefree man of slow movements, who seemed was never in a hurry. But that day, it was different. He shouted like crazy, struggling with all his strength against his captors. Three strong men were needed to subdue him. They beat him, tied him with some improvised ropes and dragged him out of his hovel. The rusty chain hanging from the gallows seemed to dance along with the rhythm of the wind that swept around the desert. Eric was dragged to the town’s plaza, where he saw that the gallows seemed to be waiting for him. He kept shouting, swearing that he was innocent. “They all say they’re innocent in the end”, a woman said to another as Eric was dragged in front of them.<br><br>“You all are gonna pay!”<br><br>His begging for mercy stopped as they placed the chain around his neck, and his words turned into insults and threatening remarks. “You’re all gonna die!” he shouted. “You’re all gonna burn in Hell…”<br><br> “Go ahead and save a place for me in there!” the man next to me yelled sarcastically at him and laughed. <br><br>For everyone, that hanging was like a party. Everyone laughed and insulted Eric as the trapdoor was released, leaving him hanging from that rusty chain. The gruesome spectacle was disgusting, as his body continued to move while the life escaped from his body. I could barely believe something like this could happen. For these people, used to live in this desert, used to the smell of blood, familiar to violence and death, this was just a way of releasing their frustration and anger. They didn’t care if Eric had been guilty or not. The evidence was clear. Nevertheless, they needed a scapegoat, hoping all of their problems could be miraculously solved, or hanged in this case, so everything would be fine. Just a few minutes later, they took the lifeless body of Eric. The same three men just dumped him outside of the town’s gates, as if they dumped a bag full of trash. The party was over, and they returned back to their homes, as it was getting dark already. But I had to stay awake and watch over the gates. <br><br>I lied on the floor of my tent, as I couldn’t afford a better place to rest at. The bell would ring in just a few hours, signaling that it was time to close the gates. And the time to brace ourselves. These things would crash head-on against the town’s defenses once more.<br><br>Having time to be alone with my thoughts was something not many other citizens could afford. For many them, it was all work in the constructions site until sunset, and then they would go back to sleep. The more adventurous citizens would spend the day, and some of them whole night, outside, searching for supplies, and trying to stay in one piece. Either way, none of them could afford to be alone, in the relative safety of the town, to think for a while. That night I was thinking about the events that had just happened. It was the third time. Two persons had been hanged before, and now it was the third time. The third time the crimes had met their punishment.<br><br>I continued to think about this punishment. I remembered the old stories I had heard. How supposedly they used to lock people up in places called prisons if they committed a crime. How these people always tried to escape, and sometimes succeeded. I couldn’t help but thinking it was kind of funny. In these times, nobody would ever think of something like that. People aren’t so forgiving nowadays.<br><br>When I looked at my old pocket watch, I noticed it was the time. I climbed up to the watchtower to ring the bell. In just ten minutes, our defenses, as well as our nerves, would be proved once more. As I climbed down, I headed to the town’s only exit. As I headed for my place, I remembered about the first victim, and the circumstances that led to his death.<br><br>It had happened just four days earlier. On an expedition. There was a man called Mark. He was one of those persons that never stay in one place for long, and being in town was no exception. He had gone outside to scout. During his trip, he had stumbled upon an old gun store. Or more precisely, upon the horde of zombies that loitered outside of the building, ready to ambush any unsuspecting human that was foolish or unlucky enough to venture there. Mark had a small radio he used for communication, and the constant annoying buzzing in our receiver at the town was suddenly replaced by his frantic requests for help. He had managed to climb to the top of the building, but a hungry horde of fourteen or fifteen zombies waited for him in the ground, ready to make him their meal as soon as they could.<br><br>The people of the town asked for volunteers to go on a rescue expedition. Four people, including myself, raised their hands. To be honest, I was interested in finding the resources in the place rather than helping Mark. I disliked him and his bossy, arrogant attitude. But helping the community was the best way of making sure they would give back the favor if I needed it. That’s how we armed ourselves with battery launchers and water pistols. Our ragtag rescue team was pathetic, to be honest, but it was the best we could muster.<br><br>We walked for a couple of hours through the desert, just stopping once in a while to take a sip from our canteens to stave off dehydration. I had stopped to drink when I saw the place from the top of one of the dunes in the desert. It was a place called the Guns 'n' Zombies Armory. An ironic name, so ironic it was not even funny anymore. Once we arrived there, we went on the offensive. We managed to put enough zombies down with our improvised weapons, and keep the rest of them at bay. While my teammates went to rescue Mark who was still on the roof, I entered the building. However, I suddenly lost my balance and tripped, while a young boy, the one who had just pushed me away, had anxiously entered the building without even apologizing. <br><br>I saw it was Sammy, the youngest member of the rescue team. Despite his short age, 16 or 17 at most, he was a self-proclaimed “gun nut”, a walking encyclopedia of guns and ammunition who was more than happy to babble about his favorite theme to anyone who had the patience to listen to him. Needless to say, he was ecstatic of being in that place. He shouted words of joy as he browsed through the empty shelves, as a hungry animal looking for food. After getting up, I had decided to forget the little incident and continue the inspection of the building for supplies. But Sammy suddenly let a loud howl of joy as he saw me picking something off the floor.<br><br>“Lemme see that!” he shouted, snatching the item from my hands. “This is a Colt 1911 MK IV Series 80”<br><br> “Why don’t you take one of those decorative hunting rifles off the wall instead?” I said annoyed. “It won’t work unless you can find bullets for it. Now give it back to me.” <br><br>“What do you mean? This thing is mine. I was the one who found it!”<br><br>Sammy ran off with my gun. I shouted some words at him, asking him to give it back. Mark, the man we had rescued, was entering the building. He asked me what was happening. When I told him that Sammy had stolen my item, he just laughed. <br><br>“It doesn’t matter”, he said, “Without bullets that thing’s just a decoration. It seems these people used up all of them a long time ago anyway. Let him have it. Come on, let’s head back to town.”<br><br>I didn’t know what was so funny. The way back to town was all fun and jokes. Sammy was laughing and playing with the gun, pretending to shoot it at everything he saw, just like the little child he was. The rest of the team members joked with Mark and laughed, while I followed them a few steps behind. They didn’t seem to notice that my mood was very different to theirs. But fortune has the habit of giving people strange twist to their lives. Early in the next morning, Sammy had been found guilty of thievery. That little rat had entered through the window of Phil’s home while he was sleeping. Phil was the guy in charge of the town’s laboratory. The intruder had stolen some pills and broken some of the instruments Phil used to mix chemicals in his rushed escape. Amazingly, Phil had not heard a noise, but the next morning he realized of what had happened. But it was clear that an adult man would not be able to fit through the window, and some of pills that had been found scattered in his home the next morning. Sammy was dragged out to the newly built gallows, where he was executed for thievery and sabotage. As he was being dragged, I took my gun from his home. Once dead, he had been dumped outside. That was the first victim.<br></em></p>

                <p>Part II [Because Twinoid is allergic to my stories and think they're too long or something <img src="../../../../gfx/square/dontcare.png" alt="-_-" class="tid_ico">]</p><p><em>The day after the expedition, I went outside, as I tried to cool myself down after an argument I had. That was because of Robert, a man who was known as Bob by everyone, who was at the bank at that time. I had headed to the bank early in the morning. Sarah, one of my only friends in the world, had suggested that going outside in pairs was safer than going alone, and I agreed to go with her. I had agreed I would take enough supplies from the bank in order to have a safe journey while she and her three-legged friend, Evykins, a fluffy labradoodle, waited for me. The problem, however, was that Bob didn’t think I had the right for taking the Battery Launcher Mk.II. “What’s a young girl like you going to do with it?” he said. “You can hurt yourself with it. Let the men handle it, you take a water gun instead”. I tried to convince him I wasn’t a child anymore, but he was one of those sexist idiots that don’t think a woman can perform such task. I knew I would not convince the blockhead old man, so I returned to Sarah. Then we walked through the sands of dune, salvaging everything we could use. But as I got back to town, I noticed that someone had decided to pay a visit to my home. I had forgotten I had left a locket, one made of silver, a memento of someone very dear to me. Someone had taken it. I saw some small footprints that the intruder had left in the floor. I just had to take a deep breath. Nobody in town would help me get my item back. Not even Sarah or the few people I relied on. As they had said before, if it doesn’t help our community it is not even worth having it.<br><br>In the morning the next day, I was awakened by a commotion outside. Mark, the same man we had rescued two days earlier, was now being carried outside by a group of citizens. It was clear he was not breathing anymore. People searched his home, but found nothing. No suicide note. Only a half-eaten vegetable, which was clearly his last meal. A poisoned meal. It seems he had died at night, and nobody noticed until he didn’t come out early in the morning as he used to do. When they inspected his home, they found that most of his belongings weren’t there anymore.<br><br>People were very sad by the death of Mark. He was considered one of the town’s leaders and a friend by most people. When people discussed about who could have poisoned him, they remembered that he and Bob had a problem some days earlier. Mark’s bossy attitude had caused a conflict with Bob, who was not willing to follow his orders. The whole town knew that Bob was not fond of Mark, so he was the first suspect. Mark’s friends broke into his home, and found that he had Mark’s belongings, as well as an empty vial of poison hidden below one of the wooden panels of the floor. He had another dose ready too. They had enough evidence, and decided to execute him at the gallows at once. He also shouted he was innocent, as they hanged him and threw his body out, into the desert.<br><br>I went to the only entrance of the town, where the open gates seemed to invite the disaster. I was the one who would make sure that would not happen. But as I approached, I could hear faint noises at the distance. It was clear, they were coming. Moaning. Shouting. It reminded me of the death I had just witnessed a few hours earlier. Of Eric’s death. How I found out he was the only one whose feet were small enough to fit in the footprints I saw in my home. How I had taken my precious locket, from his home after he was dragged outside to be hanged. But the evidence had been clear, and nobody doubted he was the person who took all the vodka that we had stored at the town’s bank. Not surprising, as his home smelled like alcohol.<br><br>I began feeling guilty. But I managed to shake off those feelings from my mind. They had just gotten their just desserts. Sammy, the impertinent brat, a thief who had stolen my gun and had been careless enough to push me aside without apologizing. Mark, the bossy, arrogant hero, who kept shouting orders at me, and had not done anything after witnessing Sammy stealing from me. Robert, that sexist old man who didn’t believe in me just for being a woman. And Eric, the one who had the nerve to steal my memories while I was away. They all got death as the punishment for their crimes. And I wondered if I, too, would get a punishment for my crimes. For incriminating them. For entering Phil’s home to stealing everything, putting the blame on Sammy. For poisoning Mark and leaving the poison and Mark’s belongings at Bob’s home while he was away. For stealing the vodka and spraying it at Eric’s home. In other words, for fabricating evidence and manipulating the whole town into getting them hanged. At that moment, I could see their faces. I could feel how they wish to drag me to Hell along them. But it couldn’t be helped. Sammy, Mark, Bob and Eric, they all in front of the hordes that approached the town. Their rotting, lifeless bodies leading the undead swarm, all of them about to crash into the town. Trying to get their revenge. And as I shut the gates on their face, I wondered. What is justice? Must all crimes be met with punishment?</em></p>

                <p><em>The wretched thing slunk forward. It kept pace as best it could with the others. The midnight sun urged it forth; it’s beam guiding it toward <strong>them</strong>. A noise above stopped the thing, a strained caw from the silhouette of a black bird. The beam disappeared, and an explosion of torment shrieked out of the things head, a shriek of freedom soon met with a cry of rage, and the skies above opened to release a fiery burst of darkness that scorched where the wretched thing had stood. The other wretched things slunk forward, unaffected by the event.<br><br>In the beginning, before the Great War, there was a place of great beauty. A world inhabited only by birds, whose knowledge was immense. The discovery of other worlds stated a new well of knowledge for the birds to draw from. So they set out from the void and crossed the black sea until eventually they came upon a land. It was barren but full of hidden life. The birds used their wisdom to call upon the life, and will it out of the ground. And life came, out through the barren earth sprouted lush green trees, and animal life burst through the bark.<br><br>The birds were pleased and intrigued by their own power put to use, and so they went forth and studied their work. They watched from the sky, in awe, as their work grew more and more independent of them. One species stood out from the rest. It seemed to understand it’s role, and it’s creators. It built great structures in the birds’ image, and spilt blood in their name. The growing ground creatures grew more and more intelligent, and built larger and larger structures of more grand design then the birds have ever seen. <br><br>Much time had passed before a great bright entity came forth through the void, from the same world the birds left. The untreated monstrosity had grown bigger and stronger and had been forgotten by the birds. Now it drifted across the black sea, and destroyed all that remained in its path. The birds, with their immense knowledge, saw the beast coming. They took flight and as the beast drew near, they blocked out its powerful rays with their mighty wings. They would not let their beautiful creation be scorched by this beast. And so for many years the birds flew, and the ground things built.<br><br>After centuries of assault, the great bright beast pushed forth a final assault, and many birds where slain. They fell from the sky, in flaming balls of feather and flesh, and burnt down several forests and killed many ground things. The ground things didn’t understand why the birds were falling, or why they were destroying their world; but a dark voice answered them. Out from behind the wall of feathers peaked a bright ball, which spoke to each of the ground creatures. It pleaded that the birds were trying to keep them from true pleasure, true desire, true fulfilment. The ground creatures were hurt and confused. Violent groups formed, and began destroying the birds’ statues. The ground creatures were overcome with the lust for the promised pleasure that the light persisted it meant to give. The ground things built large axes, and used them to slaughter any bird that ventured to the service. They chopped down all the statues and used them to build great catapults, in which they launched great balls of fire into the sky. The birds were shocked at the raw savagery, and all but a few gave in and dropped to the ground to be slaughtered by the barbaric axes. All but three survived. The Owl, which fled to the <br>south, the Raven, that fled to the north, and the Crow, that hid in the light.<br></em></p>

                <p><em>With the wall weakened, the light burst fourth, flooding the world. The ground creatures adored the warmth. They all bathed in it, and where more happy then they ever had been with the bird. But the great bright ball fell to the west, and as it left so did the heat, and so did the pleasure. But out from the east crawled a lesser light, one which brought no warmth or comfort.<br><br>It greeted the ground beasts and gave them thanks, and sent down a shimmering gift, a smaller different kind of ground beast. <strong>She</strong> came down from the sky, shrouded in beautiful diamonds. The ground beasts stared in awe at their own reflections, a smaller and softer looking version of their own war-ravaged bodies; but their desires matched and intertwined. The two halves embraced and intertwined into a mesh of fleshy pleasure.<br><br>Every day the great ball of light rose from the east, and it sapped the land of its life, like a vampire it drained the very soul of the land. The trees withered and died, and with them their children, and with them their brothers, and with them the land itself. Every night the lesser ball of light crawled up from the east, it whispered desires and pleasures into the ground beasts, who were sewn closer together then ever, in a savage ecstatic orgy of primitive pleasures. The dieing world around them went unnoticed, and when the great ball of light was finished with the land and turned to the ground monsters, they didn’t care. Their souls had already been traded away to the lesser light, and now their minds were carefully being locked away in a box with <strong>seven</strong> keys. <br><br>The two lights now merged, becoming one jeering face. It looked down upon its work and watched in awe at it’s toys wriggle and squirm as they shrieked to escape their prisons. It took their flesh and twisted it into hideous rotting forms, reflections of their own rotting souls.<br><br>The three birds met. The Owl was completely disappointed at the betrayal of its children. The Raven was outraged; it cursed, spat, and screamed in hate and in the promise of revenge. The Crow cried, for it was deeply saddened by the imprisonment of its children, and wished that they be free and things would revert to originality. Together the birds worked the last bit of knowledge into sprouting twisted life forms into the lifeless world. The new things looked just as the ground monsters before the war, but their spirit was stronger. They built up a great wall, as if they knew the monstrosities that shambled towards them now, the great original sin that they were conjured to clean. They are the last retribution of this dieing world. They are us.<br></em></p>

                <p>Alright, here it is. <img src="../../../../gfx/forum/smiley/h_blink.gif" alt=";)" class="tid_ico"><br>I'm separating it to segments since I'm assuming it wouldn't fit. <img src="../../../../gfx/square/lol.png" alt=":lol:" class="tid_ico"></p><p><strong>Trust</strong><br>by alwaysmetara</p><p><em><strong>Day 1</strong></em><br><strong>Jemma</strong><br>We have been trudging in the mist for days. There were five of us. I, Jemma, a petite girl of fourteen years. My sister, Ana, light and sunshine, full of goodness, five years older than I. Her counterpart, Travis. Quiet and reserved, twenty two years old. Jim, twenty years old, loud and obnoxious. Finally, Lizzie, a small, restless girl, eight years old. A few days ago, we found her in an abandoned building, cowering in a corner. Ana had insisted that we take her in.<br>Our time together has formed a deep bond between us. A bond that I believed was impossible to break.</p><p>A dark shape was outlined against the horizon. A town. I sighed in relief. A town meant other people, a place to hide for a few days. We started walking faster toward the town. The mist slowly cleared. Finally, the tall gates were before us. Ana stepped inside, and waved us over.</p><p>There were forty camp beds with clearly marked boundaries. I walked over to the one that was labeled with my name, and put the supplied bag of food into my rucksack. I opened my Citizen's Welcome Pack, and found a radio. Useless. I left it where it was.</p><p>We headed over to the well and had just gotten a water ration each when a shout made us turn around. Other people had come into the town. A lot of people at once. I was filled with a strange sense of foreboding as they faced us.</p><p>We had unconsciously formed a closed semi-circle, a defensive formation used in the presence of a horde of zombies. But when the leader stepped forward, I knew that <em>this</em> group of people was much worse than the zombies.</p><p>The leader was a tall, strong man, with a face as rough as an axe and almost as ugly. It was a face built to evoke fear, a face full of sharp planes and dark shadows. I knew this face. It belonged to a man named Ethan. I thought of what had happened about six years before and was filled with a rush of anger. I glanced at Ana. A battle of emotions was playing across her face.</p><p>"Oh, it's you," Ana said at last, tonelessly. I looked to my left and saw that Jim was giving him a murderous glare. Lizzie was scanning the crowd for some reason, but when we made eye contact she abruptly looked away. This day is getting off to a great start, I thought sarcastically. <br>Out of all of us, only Travis seemed unaffected. He was confusedly looking between Ana and the man, trying to read the nonverbal conversation they seemed to be having.<br>Oh, how I hated that man. I hated Ethan. He had tried to kill my sister...</p><p>I was interrupted from my thoughts when Ethan laughed humorlessly. "Oh, it's you, Ana," he said, smirking. "Long time no see. And look who's over there? Jim. And little Jemma. I've missed you, little girl." <br>My vision flashed with red. I wanted to jump over and strangle that man. But a loud gasp from Travis stopped me. I looked over. Travis's eyes were open wide, staring at a small, skinny boy who was standing near Ethan. It was obvious that he recognized him. Travis did a series of complex hand gestures, which the skinny boy returned. <br>Next to me, I felt Lizzie stiffen, then nod slowly.</p><p>Ana broke the tense silence by speaking. "I can see that you've gathered your meta here, Ethan," she said, enunciating each word carefully. "We'd better leave." She shot a pointed look at a lithe, dark haired woman standing next to Ethan. "I wouldn't want to waste Evelyn's precious time, of course. We'll leave and won't ever bother you again." She turned to us. "We're not welcome here. Let's go."</p><p>Six years ago... I was only eight years old then, same as Lizzie is now. That fateful town was only just faint sounds and colors in my memory. But what I could remember was clear. Ethan tried to meat locker Ana. I had grabbed her and ran off into the World Beyond. Jim had come with us. We lost contact with the meta, and haven't seen any of them until now.</p><p>I looked back toward Ethan. He was standing in that annoying cocky way of his. I recalled that I used to idolize him. He had seemed a fearless leader, someone who always knew what to do. Of course, all of that ended when he tried to kill my sister.<br>"Leave, stay, I don't care," he said. "I'd rather you stay, but Jemma has never listened to my words. Right, Jemma?" His mouth formed a predatory grin. <br>I didn't bother to grace this with a reply. My mind was whirring. To meet these people here... I don't even know what will happen in the next few days. An assassination attempt? A peace treaty? I sighed.</p><p>Suddenly, the dark-haired woman - Evelyn - spoke up. "They can't stay here," she said resolutely. "<em>She</em> can't stay here." Evelyn nodded toward Ana. I recalled that even back when we were in the meta, Ana and Evelyn had this weird vibe between them. I suddenly realized something: Ana was acting strangely. Instead of the light-hearted, playful girl she usually was, today she seemed almost sinister. I tried to shake off the feeling but couldn't. <br>Ana gave a forced smile that looked more like a grimace. "Let's go then," she said, and started walking out of town. We could only follow.</p><p><strong>Evelyn</strong><br>So, the time has finally come. I'll have to face Ana, and stop her once and for all.</p><p>Ana.</p><p>When I had first come to the meta, Ana seemed nice. She seemed like a friend, someone to help me adjust to all the strange faces. But I quickly learned that Ana was someone who would stab a friend as quickly as an enemy, and not to be trusted.<br>A small voice in the back of my head told me that perhaps I was the same way. I silenced it, squashed it like an ant. <br>Someone had to spy on her, so I sent my daughter.</p><p>As the town bustled around me, I put my head in my hands. I couldn't believe I had let my daughter do such a dangerous thing. She wasn't really my daughter, but I treated her like she was my flesh and blood. She was one of the few people in the world that I could trust.<br>But the plan was in motion. If everything goes smoothly, things would take care of themselves.<br>It was the time for a visit to Matrix's place. <br>While we all still had camp beds laid out on the floor, Matrix had a full tent set up. No one complained. Matrix was a relatively new addition to the meta; he came after Ana had left. However, he was vital. He was an experienced hacker, doing things that we couldn't accomplish using normal methods.</p><p>I walked in the small, stuffy tent and looked around. Pieces of equipment were lying everywhere; one shelf was devoted to a rack of strange-looking guns. I wondered briefly what they were for. Guns were useless; everyone knew that. The ammo to use them didn't exist. Matrix had even tried making his own ammo once and nearly lost his arm as a result.</p><p>I tapped Matrix on his shoulder. His small body twitched from being surprised. <br>"Freaking rootkit, Evelyn! You nearly scared the code out of me!" he exclaimed.<br>I got right down to business. "Listen, Matrix," I whispered in his ear. "Are all the preparations ready?"<br>He grinned in reply. "Everything you asked for, and more. Look at this beauty here," he said, and removed a sleek shotgun from the rack. "For you, m'lady." <br>I looked at him like an indulgent parent would at a child. "I don't have the obsession with guns that you have," I told him. "I know that they're useless now."</p><p>He laughed, a small tinkly delightful sound. "Oh, but you're wrong this time," he said. "Remember when I told you I made a pill that lets you go into the alt universe?" <br>I remembered that conversation. I had inwardly scoffed at the idea, but was too kind to do anything but smile and nod. However, I was quite surprised when twenty extra rations appeared in the well. Matrix said it was because of that pill. I was doubtful.<br>"So, this gun shoots a ray that does the same thing. It doesn't even need bullets, just emotion energy from the user. It's much less painful than the pills, and can be used as a good weapon too. This would interrupt the cycle of reincarnation and get rid of the enemy <em>forever</em>. They'll be stuck in that alt universe!" he threw his head back and roared with laughter.</p><p>I was deep in thought. If what Matrix said was true, there was no need of the poison after all. <br>"Matrix," I said intensely, cutting his laughter short. "Remember when I told you to place an old police station in (8,0)?"<br>"Piece of cake," he replied.<br>"Yes," I said distractedly. "Please put four of these guns in the zone (5,0)." <br>Matrix smiled slowly. "I don't know what you want to do, but okay then. Now I can show you the power of these guns... But make sure that no matter what you do, don't touch me at all. I might look like I died, I might look like I turned into a zed, but <em>do not touch me</em>." <br>I nodded. Matrix stabbed a long needle into his head. It went all the way through his skull and into his brain, but he only grimaced. In a smooth fluid motion, he shot himself in the head with the gun, then collapsed and was still. Steam rose from his body.<br>I raised my eyebrows, then sat down and waited.</p><p>A half hour later, Matrix blinked his eyes blearily. He pulled the needle out of his brain and wiped it on a dirty rag. The hole in his head had closed in a heartbeat.<br>"Done," he said, and leaned back and closed his eyes, obviously tired. I took the shotgun he had offered me and left.</p>

                <p><strong>Jemma</strong><br>After walking about five kilometers to the east, Travis said something. He rarely talked, so we all looked at him and paid attention.<br>"Look," he repeated. He pointed to a small mound of items on the ground. Before, I had thought that they were a pile of rocks. I looked closer and realized they were guns.<br>There were four of them. Lizzie reached for one, but Jim pushed her away. "Guns aren't toys for little girls," he said, and picked up a machine gun. Lizzie gave him a murderous glare but Jim didn't notice.<br>Ana picked up a silver pistol. Travis reached for a hunting rifle. I chose a revolver.<br>I looked at the revolver in my hand. Since I didn't understand guns, I had no idea what model it was or any of that. But it was clear to see that it had no ammo, rendering it useless. But somehow it looked important. It felt important, like there was power hidden deep inside the metal.</p><p>I ate my meager meal- a stale tart- and kept walking. Lizzie was lagging behind. Thankfully, we found an old police station after walking a few more kilometers. What made it not so good was the number of zombies there. <br>While walking, we were all keeping an eye out for useful things. However we didn't find any usable weapons, except for a plastic bag. <br>Ana furrowed her brow. "Do you think we should use it?" she asked, referring to making a water balloon to kill some zombies. <br>"We can't be using water left and right," Jim said. "Unless it starts raining..." and here he smirked, "we'll all end up dying of dehydration."<br>"Or we might get killed by the zombies before that," I said with an insane smile.<br>"Well, why don't <em>you</em> donate <em>your</em> water ration then?" he suggested.<br>I scowled. <br>Lizzie reached into her bag and pulled out a knife. It had a serrated edge, making it a decent weapon.<br>"Where'd you find that?" Jim almost pounced on the small girl, grabbing for the knife. Lizzie waved it around, trying to keep it out of reach. In a particularly desperate swipe, the knife sliced across Jim's arm and gave him a shallow cut.</p><p>Next to me, Ana facepalmed. "Seriously?" she asked. "Just give it to me."<br>Lizzie handed the knife to her obediently. Ana took it, and made short work of the zombies. Twisting and twirling, she kept out of reach of them while slicing off heads left and right. It was beautiful, but in a chilling way. <br>Suddenly, a flashback hit me. Ana was dueling with Evelyn. Ana had a machete while Evelyn had twin knives. Metal clanged on metal while I hid behind a curtain, watching. Then Ethan opened the door...<br>As much as I wanted it to continue, my flashback stopped there. I'll have to think more about it later, I told myself.</p><p>After checking out the premises, we set up a campsite to spend the night. By the light of the moon, I studied my revolver. <br>It definitely wasn't a normal gun. It was missing the mechanism for loading the cartridge. I scratched my head. Why would someone craft something like this gun, only for it not to be able to be loaded? What a waste of time.<br>I tossed the gun into the sand a few feet away, and vowed to hide in my tomb and go to sleep. However, a few short minutes later I walked to the gun and picked it up again. <br>Turning it around and around in my hands, I reminisced about the past. Ana used to be Ethan's right hand woman... And Evelyn resented her for that. But she couldn't do anything, since Ana knew Ethan for much longer than she had... Then one day Ethan accused my sister of trying to start a revolt against him. Evelyn backed him up... But I had grabbed my sister and run away. Somehow, she was mad at me for that... I yawned.<br>At some point, I fell asleep still holding the gun.</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Day 2</strong></em><br><strong>Jemma</strong><br>I woke up with a start to the sound of footsteps. It was a slight sound, but I have been trained to wake up at any sign of danger. It was the difference between life and death.<br>I heard the footstep again. It sounded too careful, too precise to be a zombie. My heart thundered. Was it someone from Ethan's meta coming over to murder us? Or might it be Ethan himself?<br>I pointed my gun into the darkness, though I knew it was useless. <br>I was completely helpless in my hole. I couldn't do anything if it was Ethan coming after me... I couldn't do anything!<br>Wild with fright, I pulled the trigger of the gun... And a brilliant explosion of light. <br>It scared me half to death as it illuminated the face of the intruder.<br>It was Lizzie.</p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief, trying to calm my beating heart. It was just Lizzie. Lizzie and I exchanged a glance: <em>We'll just pretend nothing happened...</em> and she tiptoed back to her camping spot.</p><p>I looked at the gun in my hands as the sun started rising over the horizon. There was no ammo in it, yet it fired. Later I would find out that there was a circle of scorch marks where the burst of light had hit.</p><p><strong>Evelyn</strong><br>I had to meet with Ethan today. I had a feeling that he would be trying to contact Ana, to get her back. I could not let that happen.</p><p>I walked to Ethan's tent and let myself in. He was sitting on the bed with nothing but a pair of boxers and a frayed shirt on. He was staring into space.<br>"Hey," I said as way of greeting.<br>He ignored me. <br>I walked over and punched him on the shoulder. He gave a startled jump. His pupils dilated rapidly, and swung a fist wildly in my direction. I caught his wrist easily. He relaxed when he realized that it was just me.<br>I decided to go on the offensive.<br>"Thinking about Ana again?" I made my tone low and dangerous.<br>"No," he said, shaking his head.<br>"You're lying. You only get that way when you're thinking about her." I sighed, pretending to be tired. "Look, I've told you. Ana was the one that tried to kill me. She wanted to stage a revolt against you. You agreed with me, and wanted to meat locker her, but she ran away."</p><p>Ethan finally focuses on my face. "As I've said before, that wasn't what happened. All I know is just from what you said. Ana didn't get a chance to explain. You knocked her out cold. Then that sister of hers dragged her away, so I didn't get to hear her side of the story..." <br>I interrupted. "Are you saying that I'm lying? You saw the paper in her room. You saw the ashes, her way of destroying the evidence. Everything is so clear right in front of your face, but you still say I'm lying? I think you're the one that's trying to lie to yourself!"<br>I spun on my heels and stormed out the room.</p><p>This was worrying. It seemed like Ethan is starting to doubt what I've been saying and suspecting some sort of foul play. I ground my teeth and stamped my foot, making some passersby stare. I didn't care.<br>Ana. Ana! Why couldn't she have stayed away? Why couldn't she just <em>die</em>? <br>It was obvious that Ethan was starting to distrust me... Ana's reappearance had made him remember what happened so long ago.<br>And if he somehow finds out that I had put mental inhibitors in his food back then, I will be completely screwed.</p>

                <p><strong>Jemma</strong><br>We were forced to drink water today to stop getting dehydrated. We wandered in the zones around the police station, but nothing we found was useful. <br>We found a few jerrycans and even a water purifying tablet, but we couldn't use them outside the town. I sighed. Water is going to turn into a real issue, I thought.<br>The day went by quickly. When I came back from scavenging the sky was dark and it seemed like everyone was asleep. <br>I was digging a new tomb when I heard Ana and Travis deep in conversation on my left. I dropped the rock I was digging with and sneaked over to listen.</p><p>"Why did everyone act so weird when we met that group of people back during Day 1?" Travis asked.<br>"Hmm... Because I've met those people before," Ana said vaguely.<br>"I've met one of those people before too but-" <br>"Who?" Ana interrupted.<br>"You know that skinny kid that stood next to the leader guy? What's his name..." Travis said.<br>"Ethan?"<br>"Yeah. So, that kid's name is Matrix. He's like a genius. Weird things happen around him..."<br>Ana looked at Travis. "That's all?" she asked.<br>"Well, I was able to communicate with him by using our own sign language... He told me that he made this really cool gun that he wanted to show me if he got a chance." Travis shrugged. "I told him that I'm with you guys now..." Travis noticed that Ana was staring at him. "That's all." he said. But Travis averted his eyes and shuffled his feet.<br>Ana frowned slightly, but let it pass.<br>"I used to be a part of Ethan's meta before," she said.<br>Travis raised his eyebrows.<br>"But that woman with him, Evelyn, she accused me of trying to start a revolt," Ana said, looking carefully at Travis's face. Apparently, she found what she was looking for, and continued talking. "I've been in the meta longer than she has, and Ethan trusts me completely. But somehow that time, he believed <em>her</em>." Ana sighed. "Maybe it was because he found me about to kill Evelyn. But really, she started it. She called me Ethan's pet, and many other things besides." Ana shook her head in disgust. "I just couldn't let it slide. But in the end, Evelyn convinced everyone to meat locker me. She had also knocked me unconscious, so I couldn't explain. Then, Jemma 'rescued' me and dragged me away from them, and I've never had a chance to tell my side of the story."</p><p>I nearly gave myself away by pounding the ground in frustration. Why did Ana still believe that Ethan was merely mistaken? It was obvious that he thought Ana was growing too powerful, and wanted to get rid of her. Or he just got annoyed with her and wanted to spend time with Evelyn instead. He had smiled malevolently while I struggled to move my sister's unconscious body. It must've been great entertainment for him. Perhaps he thought he was being nice when deciding not to chase us down. After all, what could we do? An eight year old and an unconscious teenager...<br>I spat on ground, but being careful to be completely silent.</p><p>"It's okay," Travis tried to reassure Ana. "If you want revenge against him I'll help you. We can even do it tonight if you'll like." Travis smiled shyly. However, he was looking everywhere except at Ana's face. Based on Ana's expression, she realized it too. <br>"Aww, that's so sweet, Travis," Ana said, keeping her tone upbeat. <br>She reached out and hugged Travis. <br>I gasped. <br>Travis froze for a second, surprised. Then he hesitantly hugged her back.<br>"You'll protect me, won't you, Travis?" Ana asked, sweetly. "I can count on you, right?" <br>Travis smiled. "Of course."</p><p>Suddenly, Ana pulled out her pistol and aimed it at Travis's head. "Don't move," she said, her voice low and intense. <br>Travis jerked his head back and felt the barrel of the gun. He froze. Then he slowly raised his arms up.<br>I watched, eyes wide.<br>Travis started to shudder. "Y-you do know that g-guns don't w-work w-without ammo, r-right?"<br>Ana smiled nastily. "This is one of Matrix's guns," she said. "My source says that this was artificially added post-creation of the town. You don't want to risk getting shot by one of Matrix's guns, right?"<br>Travis looked like he was about to pee his pants.<br>Ana stared at him, keeping the gun pointed at him while walking around to face him.<br>"You're Evelyn's spy, right?" she asked suddenly.<br>Travis gasped. "No!" he said, too quickly.<br>Ana tapped her finger and her chin and pretended to think. "Hmm, Evelyn would make you trick me into trying to get back to town, and ambush me on the way... Or maybe she'll just make you kill me while I'm asleep... The possibilities are endless really." Ana's smile grew wider.<br>I bit my lip so hard I tasted blood.<br>Travis was shuddering, looking like the slightest breeze could topple him over. "I'm n-not a s-spy! B-believe m-me p-please!"<br>Ana ignored him. "You go tell Evelyn," Ana yelled, "that she can go to-"<br>Ana pulled the trigger. A bright flash of light...</p><p>And Travis disappeared. In his place was a very large scorch mark. <br>I looked around. It seemed like everyone was still asleep.<br>Ana looked utterly tired and defeated. "Jemma, you can come out now," she said.<br>My eyes opened wide, surprised. She knew... ?<br>I crawled out of my hiding spot and stood in front of her sheepishly.<br>"Jemma," my sister said patiently. "You know why I did that, right?"<br>I looked up at her and nodded.<br>"Travis was a spy," Ana said. "We couldn't let him stay with us."<br>I nodded, mute.<br>Ana looked at my face. "Jemma," she said. "You really hate Ethan, don't you?"<br>I nodded vigorously.<br>Ana seemed to come to a sudden decision.<br>"Well," she said, "I do too. If we just survive this town and wait to be reincarnated, most likely we won't see them at all again. They wouldn't bother us again." Ana gave a warm smile.<br>I cocked my head to one side, decided that Ana's words made sense, and crawled back into my tomb to sleep.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Day 3</strong></em><br><strong>Evelyn</strong><br>Even before the sun came up, I was wide awake. I had decided what I would do next.<br>I walked to Ethan's door and knocked loudly. A day ago he decided to build himself a hovel. No one dared complain.<br>I knocked again.<br>No answer.<br>I sighed and climbed through the window.</p><p>I moved next to Ethan's ear and yelled, "HEY! WAKE UP!"<br>He woke up with a start, arms swinging wildly at my direction. I blocked the punches calmly, thinking, This really is becoming a routine, isn't it?<br>"Huh," Ethan rubbed his eyes. "It's you."<br>"Who else would it be?" I said humorlessly.<br>"That's true," he said, a smile touching upon his lips. "No one else would dare doing that."<br>"Down to business," I said. "When do you want me to attack Ana? I have a gun to get rid of her forever."<br>Ethan stared at me, the smile dropping from his lips. "Why do you want to kill Ana so much? I'd rather she join us. She was great at organizing scavenging trips."<br>"Don't you forget, she was trying to <em>start a revolt</em>. How can you stand someone like that being still alive?" I made my voice a little more forceful.<br>"For the first time, Evelyn," Ethan said, waving his hands around at shoulder height, "I'm not sure I believe you. Something's not making sense here. Why are you so excited about this? Ana should mean nothing to you. Why are you so keen on keeping Ana away? Are you hiding something?" He turned his eyes to stare straight into mine. "I didn't notice when you joined the dark side, Evelyn," he said, dead serious.</p><p>Before he could react, I unstrapped my shotgun from my back and had it pointing at Ethan's forehead. <br>"I didn't want it to come to this, but I have no choice." I said, placing my finger on the trigger.<br>Ethan's eyes darted between the gun and my face. "I thought I could trust you, Evelyn," he said. "I <em>had</em> trusted you completely for more than six years... I would want nobody else but you watching my back." He closed his eyes.<br>"You're lying," I said. "You would rather have Ana beside you, Ana watching your back."<br>I took a deep breath and continued. "After all, if I didn't drug you, you would've believed Ana instead of me six years ago."<br>Ethan's eyes opened and widened, his carefully controlled expression shattering into one of horror. "You had drugged me..." he whispered. <br>Then, in a sudden movement, he reached for the knife he always kept under his pillow. <br>I pulled the trigger.</p><p>I stared at the scorch mark left on the bed. I <em>had</em> been with him for almost eight years now... Did I have any feelings toward him?</p><p>I decided the answer was 'no'.</p><p>Suddenly, I felt a pair of eyes staring at the back of my neck. I turned around. <br>It was Matrix. He gasped when he realized that I knew he was there.<br>I turned my shotgun around and fired two quick shots toward him.<br>He pounded his hand into an antique watch he always wore around his wrist.<br>The two shots deflected off the force field that had suddenly appeared around him.<br>Matrix turned around and ran, as I ran the other way.</p><p>As I sprinted out of town, I realized that I would never be able to return. Matrix would tell everyone what I've done. All that work for nothing, I thought ruefully. The meta wouldn't be under my control in the end.</p><p>I slowed my run to a jog. I'll go find my daughter, I thought, and we'll start over. <br>And I'll go find <em>him</em>. I blinked back memories. I knew <em>he</em> is someone I can trust...<br>How could I have ever left <em>him</em> behind?</p><p>I thought about how I had left him to join Ethan's meta. That was a decision I now deeply regret. <br>Well, I consoled myself, I can fix that very, very soon. I knew I was close to the old police station.<br>In the distance, I heard the sound of singing.</p>

                <p><strong>Jemma</strong><br>I woke up to the sound of singing. I blinked my eyes blearily. Have I died...? <br>An image of a small girl came into focus. It was Lizzie. <br>She was singing beautifully. I sat back and enjoyed it.</p><p><em>"One day you'll look to see I've gone,<br>for tonight I might die, <br>so I'll follow the sun.<br>Some day you'll know I was the one,<br>but, tonight I might die, <br>so I'll follow the sun.<br>And now the time has come,<br>and, my mom, I must go.<br>And though I'd lose my life,<br>in the end you will know. Oh oh oh, <br>One day you'll find that I have gone,<br>but, tonight I might die, so <br>I'll follow the sun.<br>Yah, tonight I might die, so<br>I'll follow the sun.<br>And now the time has come,<br>and, my mom, I must go.<br>And though I'd lose my life,<br>in the end you will know. Oh oh oh,<br>one day you'll find that I have gone,<br>for tonight I might die, so<br>I'll follow the sun."</em></p><p>It was very sweet. But something struck me as strange. Who was Lizzie's mom?<br>I blinked and looked closer. It seemed like I was the last to awaken, and everyone else was sitting, watching Lizzie's performance. <br>Suddenly, Evelyn, the woman from the meta, appeared in front of us. Ana screamed and grabbed her gun She pointed it at Evelyn.<br>Evelyn had her shotgun pointing at my sister. They had guns pointing at each other, but neither woman moved.<br>I was so focused on them I nearly didn't see Lizzie take out a large machine gun- Jim's gun!<br>Everything was happening so fast. I was frozen. <br>Lizzie pointed the machine gun at Jim. The gun was nearly larger than she was.<br>Without any hesitation, she pulled the trigger. <br>Jim disappeared. The place where he was smoked slightly.</p><p>Ana glanced over. "Your mother has taught you well, Lizzie." <br>Then she turned back to stare at Evelyn. Ana smirked. "Aren't you too young to be a mom, Evelyn?" <br>"She's adopted," Evelyn growled.</p><p>I couldn't move, only stare. Suddenly it hit me. Evelyn was Lizzie's mom. <br>Lizzie was the spy. Not Travis. Lizzie was a spy for her mom.<br>Now everything made sense.<br>With this thought, I pulled out my small revolver.</p><p>Evelyn and Ana still had their guns pointing toward each other.<br>"Ana", Evelyn said conversationally. "You wouldn't shoot."<br>"How did you know?" Ana deadpanned.<br>"Well, if you were going to shoot you would've done so already."<br>Lizzie was slowly sneaking up behind Ana. She pointed the machine gun at my sister. <br>"Ana, be careful!" I ran out into the open. I pointed my revolver at Lizzie. But my hand was shaking so hard my aim was off. I'm not meant to be in these kind of situations, I thought. Six years ago was bad enough. Tears blurred my eyes as I glared at Evelyn with the utmost hatred.</p><p>Ana and Evelyn seemed to notice me for the first time. They both looked at me.<br>"Lizzie, stop," Evelyn said, calling off her attack dog.<br>Lizzie lowered the gun obediently. <br>Ana bit her lip. "Where's Ethan?"<br>"Gone," Evelyn said, taking satisfaction when both Ana and I gasped. Ethan, dead. I knew I should feel happy, but everything was happening so suddenly.<br>Ana looked distraught. "What? How? What did you... ?" Ana let out a sob. She dropped the gun, making herself very vulnerable. I frantically pointed my revolver toward Evelyn.</p><p>Evelyn let out a full laugh. She looked at Ana with one eyebrow raised. "You loved him, didn't you?" she crowed. "I never even realized! Oh, silly silly me!"<br>My mind was completely blank. Ana loved Ethan? Of course. That's why she forgave him. A new kind of anger grew in my mind. Why didn't Ana tell me this? I was her <em>sister</em>, her only family in the world!</p><p>Evelyn looked around. At Ana, at Lizzie. At me, standing there awkwardly, heartbroken. At the scorch mark that used to be Jim. She furrowed her brow. "Someone's missing," she said, low and intense. "<em>Where's Travis?</em>"<br>Ana pulled herself together enough to smile. <br>"Gone," Ana said, her move curving up.. <br>Now it was Evelyn's turn to drop her gun, her eyes filled with fresh anguish. <br>"You... shot him... with the gun?" Evelyn looked small and lonely. Lizzie walked over to hold her mother up.<br>"Yes," Ana said, fresh fire sparkling in her eyes. <br>Evelyn collapsed onto the ground. "You... don't know what Travis meant to me... I knew him since we were children. He had saved my life more times than I can count..."<br>Ana laughed, full and strong. "Now we both have nothing in the world."</p><p>I was frustrated. Ana should have shot Evelyn when she had the chance! She should shoot her now! <br>Evelyn, tricking and worming her way into other people's trust, then shattering it completely. Someone like that didn't deserve to live.</p><p>But I trusted Ana's judgement, so I didn't move. <br>"That's true," Evelyn said, starting to pull herself together and hiding her pain under a protective layer. "We're very much the same, aren't we, Ana?" <br>Ana stared at her without saying anything.<br>"Everything feels so ironic now. I've done so much to try to make things right..." Evelyn lowered her eyes. "But now I have nothing left."<br>"Same with me," Ana whispered.<br>"Why don't we join up?" Evelyn looked up with a sly smile. "I'm sure we can do anything if we work together."<br>Ana nodded.</p><p>I couldn't stand it any more. I raised my gun a bit higher and said loudly, "I'm gonna kill you, Evelyn!" But my voice was shaking uncontrollably, and tears filled my eyes. "I'm not letting you trick my sister! My sister will never be tricked again!"<br>To my surprise, Ana picked up her gun and pointed it. <em>At me.</em> "You really just don't get it, do you, Jemma?" she whispered. "In this world, there's no such thing as trust. You take or be taken. You can't let any trust get in the way."</p><p>My whole world was crumbling. I couldn't believe my ears. "Ana!" I cried, my voice full of anguish. "You're my older sister! You have to protect me! I've always loved you, what more do you need?"</p><p>"You just don't get it," Ana repeated. "Ruining what was a perfect chance for me to get more power, to <em>do</em> something with my life. You've always held me down, Jemma. And I can tell you'll never let go of your own free will."</p><p>Nothing would penetrate my battered mind. I could see was the barrel of the gun and Ana's emotionless face behind it, but my mind couldn't comprehend. "I love you, Ana! I've always tried to be a good sister, I've always saved everything for you, I would die for you, Ana... I would die..."</p><p>Ana's eyes softened a bit, but maybe that was just my imagination. "Jemma..." she whispered. "You're too old fashioned for your own good. In this world, you've got to do everything you could to survive. And if that means killing your friends, killing <em>your sister</em>..."<br>The next part was barely audible. "... you've got to do it."</p><p>I stared at my sister with eyes full of tears. The salty water was dripping down, down my cheeks and making little circles in the sand. Drip, drip. Ana's face blurring in my vision. Drip, drip. Someone screaming, probably me. Drip. Evelyn standing next to Ana. Lizzie standing behind them. They were all looking at me.<br>Drip.</p><p>Drip.</p><p>I tried one last time. "Ana! Don't leave me here! I'll do whatever you'll say..."</p><p>"That's the problem... You trust too easily. Maybe you'll like this other universe better."</p><p>A brilliant flash of light... Then everything was gone.</p>
